That would be much better than someone trying to explain it to you.  The Book of Romans is a good place to start.<br>  <br>  Jesus loves you and died for your sins but to get that Redemption you have to acknowledge you are a sinner, believe that Jesus died on the cross as a substitute for you, and that He rose again, confess this belief to others,  then turn from your sin (repent) and follow His teachings.  This is the "plan of salvation".  A lot of people are hard-hearted, stubborn, and prideful and don't want to admit that God even exists.<br>  <br>  God bless you|`|AA11510015	People believe different things.

Sin is an aramaic term meaning "miss" -- it's an archery term. <br>  To sin from a theological standpoint actually involves 3 things to be considered as such:<br>  1. Malicious<br>  2. Done with full knowledge of it's effects <br>  3. Intentional <br>  <br>  That being said there are a lot of things that ae simply a result of being "imperfect" which we are and are meant to be. Being imperfect, means that we learn, not just about our mistakes, but we learn about our limits and ourselves as individuals and human beings, our weaknesses and our strengths and what we must work on.<br>  <br>  Jesus' death on the cross is considered to be the Ultimate sacrifice - because he died without a fight - "Forgive them for they know not what they do."<br>  Jesus forgave those who killed him. Those people did not realize because they prevented themselves from believing in the possiblility of Jesus divinity. <br>  <br>  Jesus' retaliation or any act of war against them is non-divine, and Jesus had t die as a result. Even his mother, whom Catholics believed is born -conceived without the stain of original sin- did not harbour the ability to be angered. She could not retaliate or hate those who killed her son, and therefore suffered as a mother as well. (this is the reason she is revered, because of her total obedience to God, - when she said yes - it was for life- an exaple that christians in general would do well to follow)<br>  <br>  People are small, individual and weak without other's. They can only fathom so much alone, but in great numbers can to great good or great harm. We are limited by what we are and most people have struggles that keep their attention away from morality or immorality. Many are too busy with their lives, surviving, working, struggling. There really are few who seriously take these particular  thoughts into account, but there are many many people who try to do the right thing.<br>  <br>  Remember He said "I am the Truth, the Way and the Light."<br>  Those who have never heard of god, but do their best to be the best human being they can, the best mother, father, son or daughter, do God's will by sheer freedom of will, by their conscience. So they do God's will nonethless-- only throught me (the truth, way and light -- which are nterchangeable) can one enter the kingdom of heaven.<br>  <br>  There are people who are not Christian, but live better Christian lives than other Christians. It is a fact of life. There are good people and bad people, there are people who do their best, and there are those who don't care. Being a believer doesn't automatically make someone a good person. <br>  <br>  Only God knows what goes on in the heart of man, therefore He is the Judge. Only He can say for sure where someone will go in the end. And we do not have the right to judge others based on our own limited observation, no matter how well we think we know someone. If we judge, we put ourselves in His place and act as god, meaning we use his name in our Vain and we replace him with our ego. But remember, You shall have no other god's besides me -- (this doesn't mean that there are gods per se, but that if you put, ego, money, power, personal gain, AHEAD of your trust / faith in God (or for those who don't believe in a higher power TRUTH which is NEVER contradictory except in semantics) you lose...it's anautomatic sin. <br>  <br>  Therefore, contrary to popular, unfounded belief , a girl who has an abortion, let's say, is not necessarily responsible for the sin killing of a life, especially if she was coerced, did it in fear and was not fully intent, or really did not know the impact it would have on her life. Sure it is never a good thing to kill something off, but only God has the ability to have experienced suffering through her to know what she has been through. <br>  <br>  So we do not have the right to judge or anticipate someone's descent into hell. Othr wise we do sin, in such a way that it hurts others' capacity to be a whole, happy, spiritual human.<br>  <br>  Even Yoda in star vwars e.3 realized that it was his lack of compassion, and the Jedi's rigid codes that pushed Anakin to confide in someone else -- Palpatine, the devil.|`|AA12332079	From what I hear from other people, there are two hells, and apparently, it's a lot better than going to heaven; I'd think it would be boring up there...|`|AA12333649	Are you asking why more people aren't Christian?

First, to defend Chrsitianity, I am sure many people have run into bad expierances. Perhaps someone pointed the finger and said "you vile sinner," or "you're going to Hell." Let me point out that this is not Christian behavior. We are to disapprove sin, but we are also to be compassionate and kind to the sinner. We are to listen, and be kind to those struggling. Pointing fingers and being cruel is definatly not something you should do.<br>  <br>  Onto your question, many don't believe in Christianity. Others don't want to give up whatever lifestyle they are living.<br>  <br>  PS: I have no intention of "burning at the stake" as someone so put it someone who does not believe the same way I do. I will be saddened, but ultimately that person chooses what they do with their life. I can talk to them, befriend them, and pray for them.

AA11734115	"God" the term is the Old English as translated from Greek and Latin using the Germanic word in closest relation to the English/Germanic/Dutch or early European use were the terms;gut, guthan,gheu,ghu...the Germanic form *gott* being the most common vernacular at the time of the first translations to English dialects.  It typically meant "to invoke" or "to pour out" .Then to add the defining of the Tetragrammation of the Hebraic name for "God", which "God" in Hebrew is believed to originally rendered "Elohim". However the true and actual name of God is not certain but because of the "believed" definition of the Hebrew Tetragrammation of YHVH or as Hebrew translate Yod Hey Vav Hey...or in english Jehovah. I tried like mad to find the pronouciation and meaning of the whole but I am positive that the Yod means "I am" though some translations equate the whole name of God as being "I am the one I am" meaning self-existant one. Or also as for Moses "I am what I need to become". Meaning that lovingly as in "poof! Whaddya need." essentially as He was consistantly there for His belonging to Him. Also and as well its been rendered as meaning.."He brings into existance.." or "He causes to exist".  The Sacred Name appears in the Hebrew Scriptures as four Hebrew letters Yodh,  hey, vav, hey, which is closest represented by the letters YHVH.  According to Jewish tradition it is regarded as 'not to be uttered' in order never to profane it in any way.  In Judaism it is therefore pronounced as 'Adonai', meaning 'Lord'. Notwithstanding this prohibition, the Sacred Name is acknowledged in its usage as PART of the names of many Biblical characters showing that they belong to Him. <br>  <br>  Isaiah or Yeshayáhu <br>  <br>  Joshua or Yehoshúa<br>  <br>  Matthew or Mattanyāh?<br>  <br>  Judah or Y?hudaYa'akov <br>  <br>  Nathan or Nattanyahu<br>  <br>  John or Ye hanan<br>  <br>  So it is easy to see perhaps how Yod or Yood or Yud as the variations may go translated down through the ages to become God. Just as the other languages, dialects and tongues have morphed ever so sligtly  to the English renderings of Hebrew names. However, even though God is Good...the word good isn't nor never has been part of His "NAME". Just wait til ya study on the original Hebrew name for Jesus. That'll flip ya out.

Or why is a rock called a rock?  The only way to communicate a concept is to have a word for it..|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	Marianne, the word Elohim is God in Hebrew.  Not his name. God is a title. His name is YHWH and the Hebrews supplied the consonants. The english pronounce it Jehovah. The Hebrew, we think, pronounced it Yaweh.  But he does have a name and we are supposed to use it.  That's why the Lords Prayer says "Hallowed be thy name" How can you hold his name as hallowed if you don't even know it.  Look in the front of your bibles, in the preface.  It will tell you why they took God's name out of the bible.  Some bibles still use his name at Psalms 83:18.<br>  It is one of the great sins that man has committed in omitting Gods name.  The whole bible is about the vindication of Gods name and his right to rule the earth. Satan has influenced man to remove Gods name.  So it causes all kinds of confusion about who and what God is.  The name Jehovah means "He causes to become" meaning, he will accomplish what he needs to accomplish and nobody can stop him.

AA11669461	Gone. But it was written on flesh and the ink was blood.|`|AA10949487	It depends on what you mean. <br>  The Bible is a collection of books The Old Testament are Jewish in origin the oldest existing copies of most of the books are in the Dead Sea scrolls (1st century CE). The oldest partial partial texts of the New are in the Nag Hammardi library of scrolls which are about 3rd century CE they are both parchment...animal skin|`|AA11476749	The original Holy Bible no longer exists.  It was written primarily on parchment (animal skin) or a paper-like substance known as papyrus (made from a reed-like material).  <br>  <br>  As the Bible was recorded, it was passed down throughout the generations.  At the time of Jesus Christ, the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) was available in either Hebrew or Greek.<br>  <br>  I would like to present a bit of history of how we came to get our Bible as it is today.   <br>  <br>  Moses was commanded by God to write down the history of the battle between the Israelites and Amalekites, while on their desert journey. Jesus Himself agreed that Moses also wrote the first five books of the Old Testament. "And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me." (Luke 24:44) <br>  <br>  Many will say that writing hadn't yet been invented by the time of Moses, so that couldn't possibly have happened. This is a bunch of nonsense. Writing has been discovered (depending on which you believe to be first) in Egypt, circa 3300-3400 B.C., or in the Euphrates/Tigris regions around 3200-3300 B.C. Moses didn't arrive on the scene until well into the 14th century B.C. <br>  <br>  I'll continue with the history and accuracy of the Old Testament manuscripts. When the translators of the King James Bible wrote the Old Testament, the oldest available manuscript for them to use, was known as the Masoretic Text. This had been written in the 9th century A.D. It was this text that the translators based their work on the Old Testament. In 1947, a shepherd boy discovered some pottery in caves in the area called Qumran, near the Dead Sea. In these jars, he discovered scrolls, which archaeologists and Bible scholars have researched ever since. <br>  <br>  Every book of the Old Testament (except Esther) was discovered. Most of these scrolls are dated to 150 B.C. After comparing these Dead Sea Scrolls to the Masoretic Text, the scholars discovered an amazing degree of unanimity between the two, although they were written a thousand years apart. Further, the Septuagint (the Greek language translation of the Hebrew Bible) was also compared. With all of these references, there is plenty of evidence that no biblical doctrine has been tampered with.<br>  <br>  Now, let's take a look at how the New Testament came to be. <br>  <br>  There is no larger ancient body of manuscript evidence in the history of mankind, than the papyri and parchment manuscripts of the New Testament. With over five thousand actual Greek manuscripts, and numerous other manuscripts in four other languages, there are about twenty-four thousand available manuscript texts for the New Testament.<br>  <br>  Even if we didn't have these documents, we could almost have a complete New Testament from extra-biblical sources, such as ancient lectionaries, church fathers' records/sermons/writings, etc.<br>  <br>  No other body of ancient work comes close. No one really disputes Julius Caesar's The Gallic Wars (10 manuscripts remain, with the earliest one dating to 1,000 years after the original autograph). No one really disputes Pliny the Younger's Natural History (7 manuscripts; 750 years elapsed). Or Thucydides' History (8 manuscripts; 1,300 years elapsed). No one disputes Herodotus' History (8 manuscripts; 1,350 years elapsed). No one really disputes Plato (7 manuscripts; 1,300 years elapsed). No one really disputes Tacitus' Annals (20 manuscripts; 1,000 years elapsed.) Homer's Iliad, the most renowned book of ancient Greece, is the second best-preserved literary work of all antiquity, with 643 copies of manuscript support discovered to date. In those copies, there are 764 disputed lines of text, as compared to 40 lines in all the New Testament manuscripts.<br>  <br>  But we have ancient manuscripts of the New Testament that are written within a generation of Christ's resurrection, which for an ancient work, is remarkable.|`|0f25ce8d2eff3f850fd125f29c2f3388aa	the bible as we know it was a compilation of old sacred texts there was no ORIGINAL bible in the sense of which you are thinking|`|AA11046024	No original manuscript of any book of the Bible has survived the centuries.

d19636c6efcffabd9a642604d250d21caa	People need to start studying the bible .  First of all when John baptized Jesus no where in the scriptures does it say that he baptized Him in the name of the father <br>  <br>   St. Matthew 3:13-17 reads:" then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of THEE, and comest thou to me?[John knew who Jesus was, God medifested in the flesh ST. John 1:1-14*]15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.  Then hesuffered him.  16. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water, and, lo. the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of  God descending like a dove, and lighing upon him:  17 and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved Son, in whom i am well pleased."<br>  <br>  People misread scripture for example Mathew 28:19 there is no place in the New Testament where such a triune formula is used for baptism. Jesus commanded his disciples to "teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy ghost"  Matth 28:19. He did not command them to use these words or titles as a formula, but He commanded them to baptize in the Name.  The word Name is used here in the singular, and it is the focal point of the baptismal command,  The titles Father, Son, and Holy Ghost describes God's relationish to humanity, in other word Jesus is the name in which the roles of Father, Son , and Holy Ghost are revealed: Father(Creator) Son(Redeemer or Savior) Holy Ghost ( Spirit of God)  all three are One, not two or Three as some believe.  The Trinity is false created by man, it is not found in the bible.  The Catholics created instistuted in 325 AD.  Here are some scriptures of Jesus Diety Colossians 1:19, Colossians 2:9-10" For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the God head bodily.10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all prinicipality and power."<br>  <br>  Now you must be baptized in Jesus' Name,  According to Acts 2:38, Acts 8:16, Acts 19:5 just to name few.  The purpose of being baptized in Jesus' Name, not only is it a command state in Matthew, but it is also for remission of your sin. THAT IS SCRIPTURE READ IT FOR YOURSELF!!!  Don't allow people or customs to hinder you from gett SAVE!!

If evolution really is false, do you honestly believe that no scientist would jump on the opportunity to prove that fact the world? And he'd probably win some kind of award if he could do it, too. Religion, on the other hand, says, "Here are our theories. Believe them." There's no room for criticism or experimentation to see if those theories are REALLY correct. You can ask questions, but only the questions that THEY can answer. It's two completely different worlds.|`|0798cb01fe7cf89bfa47360ff18c6962aa	Yes.|`|290ec4a59fde1a15e8b18e8fc3e40a6faa	You added to Mr Randi's quote.<br>  Do you feel better about it?<br>  <br>  His definition is about magic and slight of hand.<br>  Penn & Teller do the same thing.<br>  <br>  His theory is correct but I'm afraid yours is empty.<br>  By the way, many scientists have proven facts in the Bible.<br>  Look it up.

How would you answer?<br>  Far from being a blind faith, Christianity can be logically defended.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In our everyday experience, just about everything seems to have a beginning. In fact, the laws of science show that even things which look the same through our lifetime, like the sun and other stars, are running down. The sun is using up its fuel at millions of tonnes each second—since, therefore, it cannot last forever, it had to have a beginning. The same can be shown to be true for the entire universe.<br>  <br>  So when Christians claim that the God of the Bible created the entire universe, some will ask what seems a logical question, namely ‘Where did God come from?’<br>  <br>  The Bible makes it clear in many places that God is outside of time. He is eternal, with no beginning or end—He is infinite! He also knows all things, being infinitely intelligent.1<br>  <br>  Is this logical? Can modern science allow for such a notion? And how could you recognize the evidence for an intelligent Creator?<br>  Recognizing intelligence<br>  <br>  For more information, visit Q&A: God<br>  Scientists get excited about finding stone tools in a cave because these speak of intelligence—a tool maker. They could not have designed themselves. Neither would anyone believe that the carved Presidents’ heads on Mt Rushmore were the product of millions of years of chance erosion. We can recognize design—the evidence of the outworkings of intelligence—in the man-made objects all around us.<br>  <br>  Similarly, in William Paley’s famous argument, a watch implies a watchmaker.2 Today, however, a large proportion of people, including many leading scientists, believe that all plants and animals, including the incredibly complex brains of the people who make watches, motor cars, etc., were not designed by an intelligent God but rather came from an unintelligent evolutionary process. But is this a defensible position?<br>  Design in living things<br>  <br>  Molecular biologist Dr Michael Denton, writing as an agnostic, concluded:<br>  <br>      ‘Alongside the level of ingenuity and complexity exhibited by the molecular machinery of life, even our most advanced [twentieth century technology appears] clumsy … . It would be an illusion to think that what we are aware of at present is any more than a fraction of the full extent of biological design. In practically every field of fundamental biological research ever-increasing levels of design and complexity are being revealed at an ever-accelerating rate.’3<br>  <br>  The world-renowned crusader for Darwinism and atheism, Prof. Richard Dawkins, states:<br>  <br>      ‘We have seen that living things are too improbable and too beautifully “designed” to have come into existence by chance.’4<br>  <br>  Thus, even the most ardent atheist concedes that design is all around us. To a Christian, the design we see all around us is totally consistent with the Bible’s explanation that God created all.<br>  <br>  However, evolutionists like Dawkins reject the idea of a Designer. He comments (emphasis added):<br>  <br>      ‘All appearance to the contrary, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics, albeit deployed in a very special way. A true watchmaker has foresight: he designs his cogs and springs, and plans their interconnections, with future purpose in his mind’s eye. Natural selection, the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered, and which we now know is the explanation for the existence and apparently purposeful form of all life, has no purpose in mind … . It has no mind … . It does not plan for the future … it is the blind watchmaker.’5<br>  <br>  Selection and design<br>  <br>  Life is built on information, contained in that molecule of heredity, DNA. Dawkins believes that natural selection6 and mutations (blind, purposeless copying mistakes in this DNA) together provide the mechanism for producing the vast amounts of information responsible for the design in living things.7<br>  <br>  Natural selection is a logical process that can be observed. However, selection can only operate on the information already contained in genes—it does not produce new information.8 Actually, this is consistent with the Bible’s account of origins; God created distinct kinds of animals and plants, each to reproduce after its own kind.<br>  <br>  One can observe great variation in a kind, and see the results of natural selection. For instance, dingoes, wolves, and coyotes have developed over time as a result of natural selection operating on the information in the genes of the wolf/dog kind.<br>  <br>  But no new information was produced—these varieties have resulted from rearrangement, and sorting out, of the information in the original dog kind. One kind has never been observed to change into a totally different kind with new information that previously did not exist!<br>  <br>  Without a way to increase information, natural selection will not work as a mechanism for evolution. Evolutionists agree with this, but they believe that mutations somehow provide the new information for natural selection to act upon.<br>  Can mutations produce new information?<br>  <br>  Actually, it is now clear that the answer is no! Dr Lee Spetner, a highly qualified scientist who taught information and communication theory at Johns Hopkins University, makes this abundantly clear in his recent book:<br>  <br>      ‘In this chapter I’ll bring several examples of evolution, [i.e., instances alleged to be examples of evolution] particularly mutations, and show that information is not increased … But in all the reading I’ve done in the life-sciences literature, I’ve never found a mutation that added information.9<br>  <br>      ‘All point mutations that have been studied on the molecular level turn out to reduce the genetic information and not to increase it.10<br>  <br>      ‘The NDT [neo-Darwinian theory] is supposed to explain how the information of life has been built up by evolution. The essential biological difference between a human and a bacterium is in the information they contain. All other biological differences follow from that. The human genome has much more information than does the bacterial genome. Information cannot be built up by mutations that lose it. A business can’t make money by losing it a little at a time.’11<br>  <br>  Evolutionary scientists have no way around the conclusions that many scientists, including Dr Spetner, have come to. Mutations do not work as a mechanism to fuel the evolutionary process.<br>  More problems!<br>  <br>  Scientists have found that within the cell, there are thousands of what can be called ‘biochemical machines.’ All of their parts have to be in place simultaneously or the cell can’t function. Things which were thought to be simple mechanisms, such as being able to sense light and turn it into electrical impulses, are in fact highly complicated.<br>  <br>  Since life is built on these ‘machines,’ the idea that natural processes could have made a living system is untenable. Biochemist Dr Michael Behe (see The mousetrap man) uses the term ‘irreducible complexity’ in describing such biochemical ‘machines.’<br>  <br>      ‘… systems of horrendous, irreducible complexity inhabit the cell. The resulting realization that life was designed by an intelligence is a shock to us in the twentieth century who have gotten used to thinking of life as the result of simple natural laws. But other centuries have had their shocks, and there is no reason to suppose that we should escape them.’12<br>  <br>  Richard Dawkins recognizes this problem of needing ‘machinery’ to start with when he states:<br>  <br>      ‘The theory of the blind watchmaker is extremely powerful given that we are allowed to assume replication and hence cumulative selection. But if replication needs complex machinery, since the only way we know for complex machinery ultimately to come into existence is cumulative selection, we have a problem.’13<br>  <br>  A problem indeed! The more we look into the workings of life, the more complicated it gets, and the more we see that life could not arise by itself. Not only is a source of information needed, but the complex ‘machines’ of the chemistry of life need to be in existence right from the start!<br>  A greater problem still!<br>  <br>  Some still try to insist that the machinery of the first cell could have arisen by pure chance. For instance, they say, by randomly drawing alphabet letters in sequence from a hat, sometimes you will get a simple word like ‘BAT.’14 So given long time periods, why couldn’t even more complex information arise by chance?<br>  <br>  However, what would the word ‘BAT’ mean to a German or Chinese speaker? The point is that an order of letters is meaningless unless there is a language convention and a translation system in place which makes it meaningful!<br>  <br>  In a cell, there is such a system (other molecules) that makes the order on the DNA meaningful. DNA without the language/translation system is meaningless, and these systems without the DNA wouldn’t work either.<br>  <br>  The other complication is that the translation machinery which reads the order of the ‘letters’ in the DNA is itself specified by the DNA! This is another one of those ‘machines’ that needs to be fully-formed or life won’t work.<br>  Can information arise from non-information?<br>  <br>  Dr Werner Gitt, Director and Professor at the German Federal Institute of Physics and Technology, makes it clear that one of the things we know absolutely for sure from science, is that information cannot arise from disorder by chance. It always takes (greater) information to produce information, and ultimately information is the result of intelligence:<br>  <br>      ‘A code system is always the result of a mental process (it requires an intelligent origin or inventor) … It should be emphasized that matter as such is unable to generate any code. All experiences indicate that a thinking being voluntarily exercising his own free will, cognition, and creativity, is required.15<br>  <br>      ‘There is no known natural law through which matter can give rise to information, neither is any physical process or material phenomenon known that can do this.’16<br>  <br>  What is the source of the information?<br>  <br>  We can therefore deduce that the huge amount of information in living things must originally have come from an intelligence, which had to have been far superior to ours, as scientists are revealing every day. But then, some will say that such a source would have to be caused by something with even greater information/intelligence.<br>  <br>  However, if they reason like this, one could ask where this greater information/intelligence came from? And then where did that one come from … one could extrapolate to infinity, for ever, unless …<br>  <br>  Unless there was a source of infinite intelligence, beyond our finite understanding. But isn’t this what the Bible indicates when we read, ‘In the beginning God …’? The God of the Bible is an infinite being not bound by limitations of time, space, knowledge, or anything else.<br>  <br>  So which is the logically defensible position?—that matter eternally existed (or came into existence by itself for no reason), and then by itself arranged itself into information systems against everything observed in real science? Or that a being with infinite intelligence,17 created information systems for life to exist, agreeing with real science?<br>  <br>  The answer seems obvious, so why don’t all intelligent scientists accept this? Michael Behe answers:<br>  <br>      ‘Many people, including many important and well-respected scientists, just don’t want there to be anything beyond nature. They don’t want a supernatural being to affect nature, no matter how brief or constructive the interaction may have been. In other words … they bring an a priori philosophical commitment to their science that restricts what kinds of explanations they will accept about the physical world. Sometimes this leads to rather odd behavior.’18<br>  <br>  The crux of the matter is this: If one accepts there is a God who created us, then that God also owns us. He thus has a right to set the rules by which we must live. In the Bible, He has revealed to us that we are in rebellion against our Creator. Because of this rebellion called sin, our physical bodies are sentenced to death—but we will live on, either with God, or without Him in a place of judgment.<br>  <br>  But the good news is that our Creator provided, through the cross of Jesus Christ, a means of deliverance for our sin of rebellion, so that those who come to Him in faith, in repentance for their sin, can receive the forgiveness of a Holy God and spend forever with their Lord.<br>  So who created God?<br>  <br>  By definition, an infinite, eternal being has always existed—no one created God. He is the self-existing one—the great ‘I am’ of the Bible.19 He is outside of time—in fact, He created time.<br>  <br>  You might say, ‘But that means I have to accept this by faith, as I can’t understand it.’<br>  <br>  We read in the book of Hebrews, ‘But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him’ (Hebrews 11:6).<br>  <br>  But this is not blind faith, as some think. In fact, the evolutionists who deny God have a blind faith—they have to believe something that is against real science—namely, that information can arise from disorder by chance.<br>  <br>  The Christian faith is not a blind faith—it is a logically defensible faith. This is why the Bible makes it clear that anyone who does not believe in God is without excuse:<br>  <br>      ‘For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse’ (Romans 1:20).|`|df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	You have to be careful.  There is only so much Evolution shows.  You can't push the rest on people.  Many Christians have very complex views of creation.  Many falling somewhere between pure evolution and pure creation.

ea0d6f25fb956f5240651861638ffb66aa	No, it's not. Salvation is through Jesus Christ, and always has been and always will be. The Lord said to the Pharisees: Before Abraham was, I AM. His incarnation for our salvation is the mystery hidden before all ages (according to St. Paul) and is an ontological fact that is the cause of all creation. Hence He can say, I am the Alpha and the Omega.<br>  <br>  If you read your Bible, you will see a passage in St. Paul's letters in which he talks about all the righteous of the Old Testament - they were stoned, they were sawn in two, etc. - and yet all these, though well attested by their faith, did not receive their reward that apart from us they might not be made perfect. In other words, these righteous had to wait for the coming of the Righteous One to receive their full reward. This is the work that Christ accomplished when he descended into Hades after His Crucifixion and before His Resurrection from the dead.<br>  <br>  As He says, he is the door...the way...the light...the life. No one can come to the Father except through Him.<br>  <br>  So, no, salvation is not time bounded, because the Saviour is not time bounded!|`|403f9eac5a44fbb97d54e270fe9119d1aa	There was no salvation before Jesus.

God threw us out of Eden the moment we began to think for ourselves and make judgements.<br>  <br>  In those Early days God had to be like a parent to a child, with spankings and time outs and chores.<br>  <br>  By the time Jesus came along we were maybe more like teenagers and didn't need all the disipline, but did need direction.<br>  <br>  Jesus was about changing from the old ways.  No more animal scarfices, no more stoning of sinners at the city gates, no more eye for an eye.<br>  <br>  These we radical changes and many people (possibly rightfully) rejected them initially.  They stayed conservative and avoided going liberal.  Jesus was a liberal.<br>  <br>  Now we are in early adult hood and if you will notice without the direct help of the teaching of Jesus most Jews have liberaized and no longer take the Laws of Moses to heart.<br>  <br>  This is what the Christians started to embrace after Jesus.<br>  <br>  NOw we have to figure out, based upon Jesus, what God is all about.<br>  <br>  The old way is Like should be with Like.  This can mean sex, color, language.<br>  <br>  Do you think Jesus is a segretationist?<br>  <br>  The old way was women to be silent in church. <br>  <br>  Do you think Jesus expects women's voices not to be heard?<br>  <br>  The old way was to stone fornicators.  Jesus said he among you without sin cast the first stone.<br>  <br>  Today we have issues like homosexuality.  Would Jesus say stones the Faggs or would he be as he was with Mary Magdeline?<br>  <br>  Today, by and large like is no longer with like.  Everyone sits together.<br>  <br>  Women are becoming minsters.<br>  <br>  Some say this liberalization is wrong.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say what Jesus or God thinks or wants in these areas.<br>  <br>  Now that we're adults, however, God expects us to be a lot wiser.<br>  <br>  Maybe by the time the end of the world comes, when we are probably in old age, which could be many centuries away still, God will see just exactly what we have learned from our childhood and teenage years and how we behaved on our own in the absence of a direct God or Jesus to commmand us and set examples.

It notes that "this final purification of the elect . . . is entirely different from the punishment of the damned" (CCC 1031). <br>  <br>  The purification is necessary because, as Scripture teaches, nothing unclean will enter the presence of God in heaven (Rev. 21:27) and, while we may die with our mortal sins forgiven, there can still be many impurities in us, specifically venial sins and the temporal punishment due to sins already forgiven. (not to mention Matt. 12:32, 1 Cor 3:15, and 2 Macc. 12:43–45)<br>  <br>  The Catechism is the Church's way of explaining its view, doctrine, and faith to people in an easy enough way and also showing them the many passages in the bible that these aspects of the faith are backed up.|`|AA11382493	I have no problem w/ Catechism.<br>  Whatever floats your boat :)|`|AA11570293	Because if you check out what the bible says against what the Catechism says, it is totally opposite.  As for the last verse of Revelation, no, it does not pertain only to that book but to the bible as a whole.  Nothing is to be added or subtracted from it.  Where do you get that it would end in Exodus?  The New Testament was written in the first couple of centuries AD.  The oldest bible was found in the third century which had the whole thing.  Not several hundred years later as a lot will tell you.  Where in the bible does it talk about Purgatory?  Yet the Catechism says it is there and ordained by God.  Not in the bible and it was not even in the Catholic church until the Council of Trent in the 1500's when it was thought up.  Check out your history as well as your Catholic encyclopedia and you will see I know of what I speak.  What about the Sunday verses the Seventh day Sabbath?  In the bible it states it is the Seventh day, Saturday but the Catholic church even boasts the power to change it which was done in the fourth century.  It also says that if the church did not have that authority, that the protestant churches would not follow her lead and that it is proof that the church has that authority to change God's laws.  Not in the bible but only in the Catechism do you find such a thing.  I could mention many other things that are contrary to God's Word but I think you get the picture.  That is why I think the Catholic Catechism is wrong.  I have one and I used to be Catholic so I am not telling you things I have not been taught by the church itself.  It is in the history books as well as the Catholic encyclopedia so check it out.|`|c814d92b315d2f982e1078a83d40b8d2aa	All Christians need to read this:<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ is the "I AM" or God Himself in a visible body.<br>  <br>   "For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." <br>  -- Colossians 2:9<br>  <br>  "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?" <br>  -- John 14:9<br>  <br>  "Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you Before Abraham was, I AM."<br>  -- John 8:58

b1f775de1ccfce4696b738592b56e2ceaa	the problem with labeling Mohamed a pedophile is that the term is one that everyone knows what it means, yet there is no true universal definition.   A 30 year old marrying a 15 year old is quite normal in some cultures and nobody would even consider the 30 year old a pedophile.  So it's not strictly a measure of age.  In fact , there are states still where people may wed as young as 13 or 14 as long as they have parental permission.  Many cultures have marriages arranged very early even though the marriage ceremony and the consumation of that marriage may not take place until years later.  According to sources, the marriage was consumated at 9.  By our laws and traditions that would make him a pedophile, but that does not mean it was not considered a normal practice in that cutlure.  Before you scraem BS, it was not abnormal in the past in the US for grown men to marry 13 year olds.  I believe jerry Lee Lewis married his 13 year old cousin and he eventuall;y made the hall of fame anyway.  In many parts of the world girls under ten still get married and there is no stigma attached.  i'm not saying it's right, but you do have to make the determination as to whether a person is a pedophile based on how his society defines such.|`|827a6af20619e034625e6f217dec5f6faa	didn't he marry an 8 or 13 year old girl?|`|AA12390258	Aisha was 6 when he married her.

Menstrual blood in particular was seen to embody the creative energy of the Goddess. The Saami have one word to mean the power, honor, and sacredness of three things: the blood of the Bear, the blood-red sap of the alder tree, and menstrual blood.<br>  <br>  According to Diane Stein in Casting the Circle, the marking of menstrual cycles was the first form of calendars and counting. She writes that Moon calendars carved in rock appear as early as 300,000 BCE. Her research also shows that the original wand of power, rulership, and magick was the menstrual/birth/lunar calendar stick. Brooke Medicine Eagle writes in Buffalo Woman Comes Singing, that many of the amazing prophecies made by Native peoples "about modern times were made by women in their Moon Lodges". Indigenous peoples have used blood, including menstrual blood as offerings to the gods, protection, and to bind specific energies to magical objects.<br>  <br>  In The Second Ring of Power, an apprentice of don Juan Matus and associate of Carlos Castenada describes how during a menstrual period a woman's dreaming becomes power. A crack opens up before a woman two days before her period begins. During the time of her period, a woman can step through this crack into other worlds. For this reason, don Juan believed women are better and more natural sorcerers than men.<br>  <br>  With the rise of the patriarchy, women and their power have become unclean and shameful. There are countless myths which concern the conquering of women and the Goddess and the rise of the God and the patriarchy. This attitude is best seen in the way our patriarchal society treats our Earth Mother. It is so important for us to have conquering power that we are killing Her and us along with Her. Both menstruation and pregancy are seen as illnesses which need to be gotten over as quickly as possible with as little whining as possible. We seem to have forgotten that without this there would be no human life. If we are to heal this world and ourselves, we must remember that both processes are sacred and in order to be whole, we must balance the God and Goddess energies.<br>  <br>  Women today can begin to reconnect with the Goddess by reclaiming the power and beauty of our bodies and our blood. Remind yourself each day that you are a daughter of the Goddess and as such, are a manifestation of Her power and beauty. Attune yourself to the cycles of the Moon. Record how each phase affects you and then use that energy to work with these phases. Even if you do not menstruate with Moon cycles, celebrate and work with your Moon time in whatever way you can. Begin to discuss this with those living with you. If this is all new to them, educate them so they will understand your need to connect with All That Is during your Moon time.<br>  <br>  Create your own Moon Lodge. Set aside a room or corner for this time. Keep comfortable pillows, soothing and beautiful colors, anything you feel is correct for your space. If setting aside space is not a possibility, take over the bathroom during Moon times. When space and time were an issue for me, I would lock the bathroom door and tell everyone it was off-limits for at least an hour. Then I would burn incense, light candles, and take a bubble bath. I would meditate or journey right there in the tub.<br>  <br>  This time is wonderful for personal cleansing, rejuvenation, and meditation for yourself and your family/community. Women also tend to be very grounding to others during this time. This is one reason we choose not to attend sweat lodges or other group work, except work with other women during shared Moons. Another reason is that this energy is extremely expansive and powerful. Sharing this work with other menstruating women can result in tremendous healing and visions.<br>  <br>  A rite of passage can be a powerful way to mark your transition from "second-class unclean female" to self-confident Goddess-incarnate. Choose to do this on the first day of your cycle, or on the full moon. If you can, do this outside at night or inside in the moonlight. I would suggest red candles. Red symbolizes blood and the Mother Goddess. Set up your altar with those things that mean the Goddess, Mother at Her ideal, and the power of the fertile, creative feminine. These may include shells, water, flowers (red & white), moon-shaped objects, specific stones, even an Earth globe. Choose something to use as an offering. I have used tobacco, corn meal, and clothes to be donated to a local homeless shelter. I know several people who include chocolate as part of this ritual and I have used champagne. Call on whatever guides and Goddesses you feel close to. Changing Woman (Apache/Navajo), Madderakka (Saami), Selene, Hathor (Egyptian), and Pele (Hawaiin) are all perfect for this ritual being Mother Goddesses and/or Goddesses of female power and wisdom. Offer yourself to them, ask them to aid you in your quest to reclaim balanced feminine power. Say any specific prayers or sing/drum/chant, if you choose. Charge your offering with love, beauty, and life. If it is something (like donations to other people) that cannot be given to the Earth, put it aside for later. Bless yourself as woman, mother, and sister of the Moon Lodge. Send out a psychic connection with your sisters everywhere and know you are never alone. Close the ritual and have your chocolate and champagne with pleasure!|`|d32449edb21604c177fc4633a5624643aa	No...I feel more emotional, not more spiritual.  I feel spiritual all of the time
8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	Hi my name is Nick and i'm a youth pastor and a graduate of Bible School.  i think the first thing i want to point out is that Hebrews tells us that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forevermore.  God's character and goodness does not change.  There is no specific dichotomy because we see Jesus dealt harshly with the Pharisees and Saducees at times... In your question i see much of your view questioning the goodness of God's character...  <br>  <br>  Please understand to say you are a Christian but think there is something wrong with the Bible is a scary position.  We have to take a overview of the Bible meaning that we have to understand Leviticus and Deuteronomy in its context and also consider what the Bible has to say about the same topic in other areas.<br>  <br>  Leviticus and Deuteronomy are books with a very Jewish flavor and addressed particularly to God's people.  They were books meant to prepare God's people to be a priesthood who would share God with their unbelieving neighbors (who worshipped idols, etc.)  Leviticus contains many laws which were meant to set aside a people for God's purpose (to keep them pure and holy).  Some of those laws do coincide with hygeine-- but remember there was an order of a priesthood called the levites (which Aaron was part of) and God wanted them to be pure.  Some of the judgments were harsh (but also remember the history that the Jews had been through with God- who had led them out of captivity) and showed them much.  To whom much is given much is expected, and i think that God had shown so much of Himself to the believers in Leviticus and again in Deuteronomy that he had a high expectation of those believers.  <br>  <br>  Deuteronomy means the 2nd giving of the law- and this is important because God's people had violated many of God's laws.  So first of all just the fact that God is reittirating the Covenant He had with His Covenant people shows mercy and grace (all are things we identify with Jesus).  <br>  <br>  The fact that these books are directed especially towards God's people is important.  You may be a lot harsher when your own kids break something you consider to be morally wrong than when someone who doesn't know your standards violates them.  <br>  <br>  If you read other parts of the OT- where God allowed his people to lose battles (back then if you lost a battle it meant that your God was not as powerful- since the pagan nations sacrificed to various gods) and allowed his own name to be dragged through the mud and riddiculed by pagan nations, and yet God still showed mercy to his people, it's unfair to say that the God of the OT is "Vindictive, Angry, Vengeful God."  As He told Moses- I will have mercy on whom i choose to have mercy...  In some instances in the OT where the Israelites were commanded to destroy a nation and showed partial obedience their lack of obedience resulted in many more deaths later when a nation rose up again and killed many of God's people...<br>  <br>  There's probably much more i would like to say... but wow this is getting long and a lot to digest.  Your free to email me and i'd love to have friendly discussions, ...  May God illuminate his Word to you... <br>  <br>  i also want to underscore that God's ways do not always have to "make sense to us".  We'll never understand why Jesus chose to love sinners like you and i.  In Isaiah he reminds us that his thoughts nor his ways are our thoughts or our ways..  <br>  <br>  Satan commonly causes us to question the goodness of God.  he did it in the garden to Eve and his tricks have not changed...  To only believe in the NT is to only believe in parts of God that are comfortable to you- and ultimately we must love God for who He is and has revealed Himself to be in the Word of God- the Bible.<br>  <br>  Looking forward to more chats... Be blessed!!|`|0eed39a026b3bdafe1a244d7c85be399aa	Yep... you're quite right. The Abrahamic diety of the cults of desert monotheism (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) is a jealous, petty, hateful, capricious, malicious, genocidal psychopathic mass-murderer. Yahweh... Jehovah... Allah... whatever. <br>  <br>  Christians seem to think that around 2,000 years ago, this diety developed some kind of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), in which he manifested a hippie-like personality (Jesus... spent some time on earth... now can be eaten in the form of a cracker), and some Casper the Ghost-like character with pedophilic tendencies (suspected of having impregnated a 12 or 13 year-old virgin... and being honored for it). <br>  <br>  The Moslems, however, do not share that belief; they see him as his same-old psychopathic self, essentially unchanged since his old-testament days... except that he seems to have updated his reward system about 1,500 years ago, when he started handing over virgins (in heaven) to be defiled by insane zealots, as a show of gratitude for them having carried out mass-murder and killing themselves in his name. (I think that's what happens to Catholic nuns, after they die. Where else would they find enough virgins?)<br>  <br>  Sweet.<br>  <br>  I find him very interesting to note that most Christians... including Christian preachers... haven't got the slightest clue about the historical roots of their own religion, let alone any other religion.<br>  <br>  Along with all the violence, here's some other things that you must hold as 'true':<br>  <br>  *??a universe in which all that exists are the earth and heaven<br>  *??solid 'firmmament' structure (the sky) seperating the earth from heaven (terrarium earth)<br>  *??talking snakes (with legs) and donkeys<br>  *??shepherd staff turning into an asp<br>  *??demons chased out of people and into pigs<br>  *??friendly spirits<br>  *??evil spirits<br>  *??walking on water<br>  *??multiplying loaves and fishes<br>  *??food falling from the sky<br>  *??conception by a ghost<br>  *??people raising from the dead<br>  *??the sun stopping in its tracks<br>  *??parting seas<br>  *??people being bodily sucked up into heaven (which, by the way, lies on the 'other side' of the sky)<br>  *??world-wide flood that drowned the earth to a depth of 40 feet above the tallest mountain<br>  *??creating people from dust bunnies and ribs<br>  *??magical tree of knowledge<br>  *??god speaking from a burning bush<br>  *??ritual cannibalism, by eating god in the form of a cracker.<br>  <br>  It is quite evident that in a sane world, if someone were to go around asserting that ANY of those things represented an innate 'truth' pertaining to the nature of existence and reality, that person would end up being locked up in the 'State Farm for the Funny'. Oddly, though, MASS insanity seems to convey some sort of automatic immunity along with it, since hundreds of millions of people assert ALL of these things to be true, and nobody thinks anything of it (well... SOME of us do). Not only are these people NOT locked up, but it is considered to be bad manners... politically incorrect... 'intolerant'... to even call attention to the obvious insanity of these ideas. Yet approximately 62% of the adult population of the USA is INFECTED by what seems to be some sort of insidious brain virus, that is transmitted in the form of information.<br>  <br>  How can this NOT be seen as a major problem... considering that this insane belief system has been DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE for such historical aberrations as the Dark Ages and such atrocities as the Inquisition, the Salem Witch trials, the Crusades...? (the list goes on, and on, and on.)<br>  <br>  So, how is it that the myths, superstitions, fairy tales and fantastical delusions of an ignorant bunch of Bronze Age fishermen and wandering goat herders have come to represent some kind of cosmic 'TRUTH'... without the least bit of credible evidence?|`|38592bd5a8ae303cfcdc44c448d2bcd2aa	God is the same he will never change|`|827a6af20619e034625e6f217dec5f6faa	Yes. Jesus is not a liar. God is love and He showed it over and over. <br>  And just because you do not understand the ( and I do not understand it all either ) does not mean God is the way you have written. <br>  When I became a Christian I could not reconcile the Old and new Testaments- they were so dissimilar. <br>  But reading it again, the Old, I began to see the pattern. God told the Israelites to choose life over death, blessings over curses. He told them the way to walk in the blessings.<br>  They chose the path they walked, as do I and you.<br>  Re-read the passages that disturb you and ask Him to help you to understand.|`|AA12204505	Before Jesus came they were bound to the law and the law condemned them. But when Jesus came and died for us He fulfilled the law. Now we are under the new command and that is to love God, love others as you would yourself. If love is your motivation you wouldn't commit the Ten Commandments or do anything to hurt others. The law in the OT had to teach us what harms others and what God did not want-worshiping other than Him. But instead He wanted you to come to a place to where you wanted Him. He doesn't want you to be forced to love Him, cuz you are free to love Him by Jesus coming to save us. The old law does not have a hold on us cuz we are saved by Jesus's Grace, and that covers us. Its like God had to deal with the "kids" in the OT but now in the NT "we are adults and we can move out of the house" and govern ourselves with love and knowing what harms others and not do those things.|`|fdae2db8c1949234eabb30a2f60818ccaa	"Excuses such as; it had to be so that the messiah may come, or that people back then were evil, or that God was trying to preserve a holy society do not measure up to any logical or moral reasoning."<br>  <br>  Christianity is not based upon Logic, morality, or Reason.  It is based upon an out-dated, antiquated book written thousands of years ago.  Because of this, it is based upon the logic and reasoning of then.  Since myths and flawed scientific knowledge (the things you need for accurate Logic and Reasoning)was what people believed in then, that is what the Bible is based upon.  For a religion that is based upon logic and reason, try Deism!!!|`|355a76d3c99e1f45a05044300e0ee7ceaa	Yes, God is the same yesterday as He is Today.<br>  <br>  Back then God spoke directly with people just as we do when we're sitting next to a friend. But, the people still did not believe. His punishments for back at that time were harsh because they didn't have to do like we do now. Now, we are completely believers by faith because the things God did back then are not exactly what He does now.|`|4016bf5b00c31c28098a9db23b11fd78aa	Yes, It is described in the Old Testament.

I know that this really isn't a completely fair comparison, but this was what was best for the people at the time. <br>  <br>  Also, and more importantly, this was, is, and always has been God's approch to sin. Sin is utterly unnacceptable in God's eyes. However, Jesus offers forgiveness from sins because he suffered the consequences. It's like you were fined $50000000, and Jesus paid it for you. God still demanded it be paid, but Jesus paid it.|`|AA12125769	Stop reading Bible Cliff notes and read it for yourself. The things that you say God said or did is usually a consequence to someones wrong doing. The Old Testament talks about how God Loves us and wants to prosper us more than it talks about judgment.  Do you feel there should be no punishment for breaking the law. It is okay to punish someone for breaking Man's laws, but not God's Law right?|`|d65a4d0cf4a9b4916324cc18726d783baa	Yes he is the same God. The bible says "I am the same yesterday today and tomorrow."  And the God of the Old testament was not hate filled and vengeful, I think a lot of people read into that, but in the New testament we read about everlasting fire and hell that's a lot worse than getting stoned to death isn't it?|`|d7a39eb08a0842ca0217b29885c9364caa	he is absoloutly the same. murder is killing another human being for your own purposes. god did not order murder, he ordered punishment. the hebrew word for murder was never used in the bible for an act of god.

I was in my second year of seminary (working on a M.Div.) and I was researching Neo-Paganism for a class on evangelism. I had read everything I could lay my hands to better understand Neo-Paganism and I had also gotten to know a number of Pagans. I had developed a good relationship with a number of Pagans and I was considered okay. I’d listen to what they had to say and I wasn’t judging them. I also wasn’t trying to ram a Bible down their throats. I’d disagree with them on many things but I was willing to live and let live.<br>  <br>  It was spring and out of the blue this one coven invites me to watch their Beltane rite. They let me know that I was only there as an observer and that I was not to say anything or disrupt their ritual. I agreed and showed up with my notebook, pen, and paper to take notes. So I sat down on the side of a hill and watched. I remember sitting there and watching with a clinical detachment as they cast the circle and then began sharing what was going on in their lives. They then started a chant and to be honest I was feeling pretty darn bored.<br>  <br>  Then out of the blue what felt like an overpowering wave of love just hit me. I had never felt anything so strong in all my life. It was just pure love and it was pouring into me. I just lay back in the grass and absorbed it. It is really hard to explain the feeling… Utter acceptance, love, safety, wholeness, peace. It was amazing. When it passed the coven was sharing a meal. I quietly pick up my stuff and left, not saying anything to anyone.<br>  <br>  I went to chapel the following day and it felt empty, hollow and absurd. For the next three months I tried to get that experience out of me head but it wouldn’t go away. My Christian faith felt dry, boring, unimportant and for lack of a better word, silly.<br>  <br>  That summer I quit seminary and began the process on initiation into Wicca. The Goddess has made her love for me known repeatedly over the years. And it wasn’t until five years ago that I understood that first experience. Five years ago I was rocking my son to sleep and he lay peacefully in my lap. Suddenly I felt love flood out of me and into him. It was then that I knew what I was feeling that night was how the Goddess feels for all her children.<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  Pabs|`|AA10691438	Id love to tell you... but here it would get trashed.|`|0add0ebc7e950155d4e120d651fb208faa	Well I can give you a short version of it. I was going to kill myself I had spent a lot of time in Wicca and tied myself to many demons they were watching and waiting for me to die. They were pretty much slobbering to distraction when Jesus came and banished them all he said "come let us reason together"  and we walked back to my room. I found my roomates bible and read it (that quote is from Isaih) and kept reading all night. I have followed Jesus ever since and had a pretty great life since.|`|AA10744085	I've had MANY experiences. I had a co-worker who did not believe. However, one weekend we went to Canada to sightsee.

Said he never experienced something like this before.<br>  Ok; no problem. I'll deal with it.<br>  Well, we also had an odd painting in our room, so I asked one of the motel staff about it? Turned out to be the image of a spirit a medium had seen in the motel, & so she drew it's image, & it was hung in our room!<br>  After breakfast, I returned to the room & dealt with it. My friend entered the room, & his eyes got huge. He exited the room; re-entered; re-exited & re-entered one more time.<br>  "It's GONE"!, he said. "That presence is gone!"<br>  He now believes, too.

AA10584995	I've never been to a healing mass, but I have seen people healed through the laying on of hands in regular church services.  <br>  One example: <br>  a woman I know was diagnosed with cancer that had spread to almost her entire body.  It was literally everywhere imaginable.  The doctors gave her 1-3 months, but doubted she would make it 6 more weeks.  She went downhill pretty quickly.  People started praying and she went to a few services where people laid hands on her and prayed over her.  She was being brought in a wheelchair by then because she could barely move.  5 weeks passed, then 6, then 7.  She slowly started feeling a little better.  By the 3 month mark she walked into her doctor's office and told him she felt better than she had in years.  He did new tests, compared them to the old tests (she'd seen several different doctors and had several sets of tests run, so there was no doubt that she was being eaten alive by the cancer.)  Every single sign of cancer was gone.  <br>  It's pretty obvious that God healed her.|`|df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	They exist.

And do you realize that the people these Muslims are killing are ... other Muslims?  Because they are 'different' Muslims, so they must die.<br>  <br>  Iran is a wonderful example.  They bring in billions of oil dollars every day, but the citizens are in poverty because a handful of Muslim 'holy men' keep all the money for themselves while they send the Muslim children off to be human landmine detectors and human bombs.

Any of you ladies up for a round of 'female circumcision'?<br>  <br>  Ever notice how all the Muslims say that theirs is a religion of peace, but their founder spread their religion by the sword, and even today, of the 20 - 30 violent conflicts currently going on around the world, 90% of them involve Muslims trying to spread their religion by the use of force.  And why do these 'peace loving' Muslims NEVER condemn the beheading of someone, or the bombing of restaurants and shopping centers?<br>  <br>  Why do Muslims always criticize the use of force by a government to defend its citizens, but completely support the use violence and terror to advance their religion?  Why is force always 'bad' for any reason when someone else uses it, and violence and murder are always 'good' for any reason under any condition as long as a Muslim is behind it?<br>  <br>  Yes, it is 'the big lie'.|`|6411cbdddabf938d46c9c5cae0f40bb5aa	i have no idea what this guys question is JESUS is a GOD huh he is prophet to me just a human nnothing else in ever hour 667 muslims convert huh joke of the day i think in 1 year the whole MUSLIMS will trun in chirstion bull **** i am a muslim i have compared ISLAm with all religions but the best came was ISLAM MASHALLAH what a beautyfull religion shame on that people who convert they dont know the true meaining of ISLAM ALLAH OH AKBAR(ALLAH IS GREAT) if there are people(muslims) who conver to other religion but on other hand people(non muslim) convert to ISLAM so stop and think about it that<br>  THERE IS NO GOD BUT ALLAH AND PROPHET MUHAMMED IS HIS LAST MESSENGER|`|7778252708581f500e486f4708815bb2aa	OKAYYY....heres a nut trying to follow hitlers sayings....<br>                     i guess some muslim told u this and u tore ur pants off trying to refute it! - its the statistics that say so. none of ur stupid links will ever prove anything - especially if u go by ur 'authentic' sources such as a few casual words by mr. nobody like ahmad al qataani...<br>                     after all the anti islamic propaganda against islam pumped by the media - islam still holds a place in millions of hearts, and yes... includes reverts too! - islam gives ppl. satisfaction and peace of mind... - by the way i heard france footballer frank ribery embraced islam recently... mashaAllah!|`|AA10006024	Your link takes us to a 404.<br>  Where is your source other than an Islam bashing website?|`|AA10507156	God never said Jesus is my son and Jesus never said God is my father.GOD never sent Hitler as his messenger and God never revealed websites to Jesus he reveal the bible,no it was injil(the gospel) to Jesus.<br>  The bible is combination of the books of Jesus,moses,David...........(those books were previously sent separately at separate times to separate prophets).they were combined after Jesus went and given the name bible.I don't know who combined those books and named it bible.The bible was never revealed as a book by GOD.

You no longer need that form.<br>  <br>  Evidently, he knew your need ten thousand years early.|`|AA10197119	is your question a form for a prayer request you dont need a form for a prayer request!! just make your question i little more detailed next time thx!! :)|`|fc6ac14ca9b3457275f65fe0a9d1fb95aa	Can you please provide more information?  For example, what kind of server-side scripting is supported on your server?  What database system are you using?  Do you even have access to dynamic content?<br>  <br>  The "works on any server, may not work on every client" solution is to include a form with the tag:<br>  <br>  <form action="mailto:me@mydomain.com" enctype="text/plain"><br>  <br>  (If I remember correctly).  But, as I said, not every computer can use this.  You may also want to look up a free service online that will process the forms you write and email you the results.  They generally do a little bit of advertising, so be careful.<br>  <br>  But, if you have access to a server with server-side scripting, I'd suggest using PHP or ASP to write the requests to a database.  Then, go in and approve the requests every so often, and post recently approved requests to the website.  This requires more technical knowledge than I can explain on this, but you'd be best just looking for sample tutorials online.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, and God Bless!

Politicians on the right fear a backlash if they take a stand, and some of them want cheap labor  of illegals to keep their own profits high.  And lastly, because most Americans are polite and don't want to raise a fuss.  I will, not for the sake of raising a fuss, but for the sake of standing for law and order and common decency.

Es mas sano, y mas maduro para uno mismo, entender que la atraccion es un sentimiento muy bonito que nace de ti y que si quieres, solo si quieres, y sientes que estás preparado, puedes darle a esa persona. Obviamente, esa persona es libre de aceptar tu cari?o o no, o sea, decirte que tu tambien le gustas, o no; tambien puedes encontrarte con que esa persona te quiere pero no del mismo modo en que tu le quieres. Tambien te puedes encontrar con este tipo de personas inmaduras que quieran jugar contigo... pero al menos carajo, estás tomando la situacion entre tus manos y no la dejas al rumbo del destino!!|`|b2beaa4f69d75f28d30dc757f0cb4910aa	por verguenza|`|d060bf7f9c5635d9bc47e80386fc74e4aa	por pena.....bye<br>  ???????????|`|d87033f46e5a612727e2ebe4cd10bd9baa	Orgullo, miedo a no ser correspondidos, verguenza...|`|f4ad18ac29dd3cc7b21285ef18a3e81faa	yo digo q es x miedo a no ser lastimados|`|0ccfb7f6e0186d835eb5ecdee003668aaa	No todas las personas, generalmente eso se dan en personas jovenes con poca experiencia o en adolecentes.|`|2014ef68ce4f28493a72eba6a235fe1daa	Por, miedo a que nos valla a rechazar.|`|23bdf584f880a40de33aada3b53f5df2aa	por miedo al rechazo..|`|4b4bb7cc7c4b22e88b55e4fefacace00aa	por naturaleza el ser se intimida nate la atraccion pura de preferncia distinta|`|69f0bf473e9c0121f5ce12207b8d18e0aa	Hola SPANQUI:<br>  <br>  Si esa persona ya tiene un compromiso es por respeto.....<br>  Si no lo tiene puede ser :<br>  Por miedo a ser rechazado  y lastimado ,<br>  por miedo a ser  malinterpretado......<br>  por pena , por cobardía....... <br>  porque a veces no pensamos que no tenemos la vida contada !!!<br>  <br>  No lo pienses mas .... dícelo ya !!!!|`|7fabf78f2ea225f07f09d05273d89b9caa	por el miedo de que seas rechazado por aquella persona y quedes en verguenza|`|cc127e285108c85b38eeb5028c55b2d9aa	mira, a mi me gusta un chico hace 4 a?os y no se lo reconozco porque no kiero perdeerlo. tenemos una linda relacion de amistad y la verdad tengo miedo a q a el no le pase lo mismo y deje de ser mi amigo, y sufriria mas sin tenerlode ninguna manera...|`|d0b5e4b41c4f8a812259ba8042ff7a50aa	Por temor a fallar o a que esa persona no nos acepte, es normal sentir ese temor supongo.|`|f19336d364916bc0a2c9df39235f8a53aa	??porque se nos nota mucho!!<br>  Al menos así lo sentimos. ?Sentimos cosas tan fuertes!, cuando estamos con el/ella, que tenemos de que se nos note y emepecemos a tartamudear o a flotar o a derretirnos o a ruborizarnos ahí mismo, como en los dibujitos animados , ?te imaginas que papelón sería!

9b83d98df370cbfc981aa7d743177afdaa	In Matthew 19:13-15; Mark 10: 13-16 and Luke 18: 15-17 it says "the disciples" and does not say which one or ones forbid the children. In Matthew 19: 13-15 Jesus says "Let the little children come unto Me, and forbid them not; for such is the kingdom of Heaven".  In Mark 10:13-16 He says "Let the little children come unto Me, and forbid them not; for such is the kingdom of God.  Assuredly, I say unto thee, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it".  In Luke 18:15-17, Jesus says "Let the little children come unto Me, and forbid them not; for such is the kingdom of God.  Assuredly, I say unto thee, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it".<br>  <br>  What is interesting in comparing the Gospel accounts is the way in which each describes the way the disciples react.  In Luke, it says "Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked Him".  In Matthew it says " Then little children were brought to Him that He might put His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them".  In Mark it says "Then they brought little children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them".  Notice that in Luke, the disciples rebuke Jesus while in the other two accounts, they rebuke the people who brought the children.  <br>  <br>  The reason the disciples didn't want Jesus to spend time with children was that they wanted Him to spend more time with influencial and powerful people to improve His position and prestige.  At this time in His ministry, many of His followers expected Him to be the kind of messiah that the Israelites had been hoping for for a long time: a military leader who would free them from the Roman Empire.  What they didn't understand, was that He was an even greater messiah than that in that He freed them from the eternal bondage of sin, not just the temporary bondage of the Romans.<br>  <br>  The main point of these passages though is that Jesus was telling them in Judea at that time and us today that in order to enter the kingdom of God, that is, go to Heaven, you have to have faith in God the way a child has faith in someone who cares for them.  A little child, especially an infant as Luke refers to them, have complete faith and trust in their parents or other people who are regularly around to play with them and provide their needs in a loving way.  In the same way, we are to have faith in God that He will love us and provide for our needs.  Just as a child doesn't understand the complexities of his or her relationship to those around him or her, we don't need to understand everything about God in order to have a trusting relationship with Him.|`|10193ec0dd50662bf7243bb9a2cc2429aa	Matthew 19:13-15 - Then (after the Pharisees had questioned Jesus about divorce) some little children were brought to him, so that he could put his hands on them and pray for them. The disciples frowned on the parents' action but Jesus said, "You must let little children come to me, and you must never stop them. The kingdom of Heaven belongs to little children like these!" Then he laid his hands on them and went on his way.<br>  <br>  Mark 10:13-16 - Then (again after being questioned about divorce) some people came to him bringing little children for him to touch. The disciples tried to discourage them. When Jesus saw this, he was indignant and told them, "You must let little children come to me - never stop them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Indeed, I assure you that the man who does not accept the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." Then he took the children in his arms and laid his hands on them and blessed them.<br>  <br>  Luke 18:15-17 - Then (in Luke's account after the parables about "the persistent widow and the unjust judge" and "the Pharisee and the tax-collector") people began to bring babies to him so that he could put his hands on them. But when the disciples noticed it, they frowned on them. But Jesus called them to him, and said, "You must let little children come to me, and you must never prevent their coming. The kingdom of God belongs to little children like these.

Go puja. <br>  There is a special festival which falls this year on 23 Oct where cow will be worshiped by all true follower of Sanantan Dharma.<br>  <br>  But Cow is not worship on the level of Supreme Personality of Godhead. Cow is worshiped as one’s Mother.<br>  Worship of seniors, specially the Spritual Master, Parents is there but not on the level of God. They help us and educate us to learn about God and make our life perfect. Hence they become representative of God. They are worshiped as such..<br>  <br>  Most of us are living in City and we have forgotten the importance of Cow. Cow specially provides us milk, even long after our own mother has stopped feeding us her milk. Milk is very important for the development of Intelligence.<br>  Bull helps us in farming and that is how we are able to produce Grains for food. Still in India Cow Dung and Urine are used for its antiseptic properties and as medicine to cure many diseases. Butter from milk and Ghee is used instead of Oil for cooking. <br>  Dried Cowdung is still used in many villages as cooking fuel instead of cutting the trees. <br>  Dry cowdung is burnt and smoke is used to drive away mosquitoes. Plastering the mud house with cowdung keeps away many insects and rodents. <br>  This is the way of Simple and natural living...<br>  But we have now made our life hitech. Milk and grains comes from supermarket and we dig the earth deep to get oil to cultivate the fields and for pesticides and for cooking. And then we create so much pollution and exploitation of earth and ofcourse Hitech problems. But this will not last long, God will not allow this exploitation of Earth and will destroy this civilization. <br>  The followers of Sanatan Dharma still know the importance of Bull and Cow and worship them as Father and Mother, for the service they give to us. We are proud of them. That’s the way we show our gratitude...<br>  <br>  Not that you drink milk and then Cut the throat...|`|a340f0dcfb3adc1fced1f167e862b973aa	HOLY COW!!!!!!!

Neither is knocking on people's doors trying to get yourself into heaven.  Religion is just as far off the mark as Evolution is.  Read the Bible.  Believe what it tells you.  If you don't understand it, ask God to help you.  Your reading it will be much more effective and make it much easier for you to understand when you ask Jesus to come into your heart.  I can't imagine reading it without the help of the Holy Spirit.  This is not religion, this is a relationship with the living God who created all things.  Are there some things that you have to accept on faith (or put on a shelf until you find the explanation)?  Yes.  That's part of the journey.  But YOU CAN understand what it is saying without making up excuses for it.  Evolution is hogwash.  And what's worse about it is that there is no peace or love or hope in it.  Religion is about trying to make yourself feel better, and usually involves you being engaged in a lot of fruitless work.  In religion you have to subject yourself to a system of do's and don'ts.  In a relationship with God through His Son Jesus Christ, He gives you what you need in your heart to live a blessed and successful life.  Hope that helps.|`|AA11659811	im a christian but i do know about evolution and there is a lot about creation that confuses me. theres a lot about evolution that confuses me. but i can see how evolution makes more sence than creation. for the simple reason that there is sience and physical evedince that can show how we evolved from other creatures. where those creatures came from is another question though. there is so much that was left for imagination i do believe. not everything was meant to have an answer.|`|AA11945075	That's a good point.

But the issue confronting us is not about our origin. It's about our destiny and the alternatives are clear. It's either believe God or don't. Since we won't know from experience that we made the right choice until it's too late, believing God is the only logical thing to do. If believing Him is wrong, we'll simply get the destiny that was always intended for us, no harm, no foul. But if we're right, we'll be blessed beyond measure.<br>  <br>  However for unbelievers it's just the opposite. If they're right, they'll just get the destiny always intended for them, but if they're wrong they'll burn in Hell forever.

A little slanted, wouldn't you say?<br>  <br>  Where do you find your truth, on TV, in the media? It's too bad people believe everything they hear without investigation.<br>  <br>  You have not been to my church and witnessed the healings; the very idea seems repugnant to you.<br>  <br>  I have been where you are. I was raised in church but bailed because of the control and lies. I went thru two degrees at several colleges and universities before settling on engineering, but always trying to find the truth. The math was about the only truth I could find that held across all cultures, situations, and accross millennia.<br>  <br>  I've investigated and studied Evolution thoroughly, but I doubt very much that you have. You freind, are more than likely the ignorant one,<br>  <br>  Have you ever seen a divine truth in a magazine? If so, rarely. In newspapers, almost non-existent. And television—never—unless it is some learning channel. And even there, how can a “Theory” of Evolution be taken as fact so easily, when this treatise involved in biology asserts no proof, or even a well-defined premise, that man evolved from apes? Even if the truth we are seeking were revealed, people believe that because they comprehend, they conclude that they have successfully taken in the material and reached a proper conclusion. Permanent incorporation requires repeated exposures and answering difficult questions. We can eliminate this major misconception or false expectation with the evidence of psychological research and the Ebbinghaus Curve of Forgetting. <br>  <br>  Still yet, we must distinguish between “knowing” and having information. “Knowing” is having direct experience of reality, while “being informed,” is having definitions, descriptions, names and narratives. Knowing vs. being informed are direct antagonists of each other. Knowing is a process that begins in the visual processing of the right side of the brain and culminates in the unification of reality and the two brain hemispheres, while becoming informed takes place in the left side of the brain and culminates in the total separation of reality and the two hemispheres of the brain.<br>  <br>  The left side of the brain breaks up the world into finite components and time sequences, and the other, the right side of the brain, focuses on the unity of things in the world. The left hemisphere is the intellectual, syllogistic logical faculty that we measure through IQ tests, which excels in communicating finite concrete ideas, in addition to the definitions and descriptions that makes up the technological processes (chemistry, mathematics).<br>  <br>  But not everything in the world fits neatly into definitions, descriptions and linear logic. Therein lies the problem with predominantly left-brained people, and Western civilization in general, who try to use this faculty to communicate all realities. This problem is compounded by the ingrained belief of most people that information is knowledge. And worse when we try to understand ourselves.<br>  <br>  “Know thyself,” they say. But what is real? What is the truth? <br>  <br>  Most people describe themselves with their habitual pattern of thought and emotional responses to events. And too, most people identify themselves as the thought generator (their minds) and its contents (their beliefs).<br>  <br>  This misunderstanding is responsible for the impossibility to “Know thyself.<br>  <br>  We are also taught that “will” is a separate entity, but it is not, neither separate nor an entity. Consciousness and the will are opposite polarities (passive and active) of the same function. They are not really separate. They are two parts of the same thing, so I shall heretofore refer to them as “consciousness/will,” or simply “C/W.” As two parts of the same thing, they act in concert together.  But the will also exists apart from the functions it sanctions, initiates, selects, controls, or suppresses.<br>  <br>  We have verbal and graphic thoughts, but we also have a “thought generator, that throws thoughts into the sphere of consciousness, but functions outside and independent of the will. This is the mind.<br>  <br>  We also have feelings, emotions and sensations, but also a “feelings generator” (incorrectly labeled as our soul).  The generator of thoughts, emotions, and sensations is one and the same. But we have no perception of its existence and activity. Something (this thing) is working outside our sphere of consciousness that is guiding our physiological, mental, sensual, and emotional functions. This hidden, subconscious, or unconscious agent is called the spirit, the psyche, or soul.<br>  <br>  The consciousness/will, or C/W, are the indicators of ourselves. If I assign them to the essence of our being, then I am defining our Selves as functions instead of entities. It becomes clear then, that these faculties within us are really the essential expressions of who we are, made by God to serve a function in the world. <br>  <br>  Without God in the picture, we are reduced to nothing—a lost and helplessly drifting vessel. We are that which perceives the mental and physical worlds, but is imperceptible itself; that which “will” changes, but cannot (or will not) be willed or influenced to change. We are not aware of it, but C/W is the means through which we are aware of and dominate the world—inner (mental) and outer.<br>  <br>  The spirit is the generator of our thoughts and emotions and sensations, as well as the functional agent behind our physiological functions (heartbeat, respiratory, blood flow, etc.); these are the forms and force--- through which our living is conducted, but is not who we are, even though we mistakenly think so. The spirit (unconsciousness) is the storehouse of knowledge, but devoid of consciousness, is incapable of knowing this knowledge. Neither can it know itself or anything, even though it stores the knowledge of the universe.  And herein is the crux of the problem.<br>  <br>  The consciousness/will can know, but has no storehouse of information. The C/W can initiate changes in the spirit, but lacks the power to carry them out. It can know itself and can identify with the not-self.<br>  <br>  The spirit cannot initiate changes in its activities, but it is receptive to change from influences proceeding from the will, suggestions and stimuli from the environment, provided it is exposed to these at the right time or in the proper manner.<br>  The underlying causes of our problems in the world, then, is lack of knowledge of Self, and acting with lack of truth or knowledge. We identify with the modalities of the unconscious, the spirit, instead of the conscious will.<br>  <br>  The consciousness/will can decide which thoughts, feelings, and actions will be acceptable, but cannot generate thoughts and feelings, and lacks the power to carry out the acts it indicates to take place. On the other hand, the spirit has the power to generate thoughts, feelings and actions, but cannot direct these. One of them knows and directs, but is uninformed, while the other is incapable of knowing and directing, yet it is the power "to do" in the world.<br>  <br>  Power is not an attribute of the will. The concept of interpreting the inability to act as desired, as weakness of the will, is erroneous. Nothing is wrong with the driver, if the car breaks down.<br>  <br>  Without some Divine hand or purpose connecting the C/W and the spirit, we can't know anything, are totally lost, and can't possibly act correctly. The car has no driver; it is empty.<br>  <br>  Do you begin to see the Divine Plan? Without God guiding our spirit, we are designed to be lost. Why did God go to all of this trouble, creating us in His own image, if this were not so? <br>  <br>  But it is difficult to reason with "ignorant Christians" with irrational beliefs, or is it so different with real and normal people?<br>  <br>  I have studied the Tao, the Quran, the Upanishads, anecdotes and parables mostly, but a lot of human understanding also. How about this one, “As long as you derive inner help and comfort from anything, keep it” (Mahatma Gandhi). Does that apply to kleptomaniacs and sex offenders? <br>  <br>  You may well ask, where did I, or where do I find truth? There is no question, no opinionated belief without fact that most "normal" people rely on. <br>  <br>  I can give you many reasons, but I will concentrate on two that stand out as to why the Holy Bible, my Bible, is the real deal; the Word of God. <br>  <br>  It is the responsibility of each of us, after a certain age, to find the truth. The common thread of almost all religions except one, is man seeking God. By contrast, Christianity and the Holy Bible is about God seeking man. The Holy Bible is the only book that prophecied the coming of Jesus Christ, several hundred years before he was born. It told where he would be born, where he would grow up, that he would flee Egypt, the entire story ahead of time. This is only one of hundreds of prophecies that have come true down to every detail. There is no question that these are the writings of God Himself, through the Holy Spirit in man.<br>  <br>  This is getting lengthy, and I won't bore you much longer with this finatical reasoning, but I will give you one more reason that proves the validity of the Holy Bible in one word: "Israel."<br>  <br>  It was prophesied in the Old Testament, hundreds of years before the birth of Christ that Israel would be destroyed, and their citizens scattered about the face of the earth. The Romans fulfilled that prophecy in about 40 AD. There was no more Israel for almost 2,000 years. <br>  <br>  It was also prophesied that Israel would be rebuilt, and it’s people return, and further that this would mark the beginning of the End Times. <br>  <br>  At the end of World War II, the British partitioned Israel into Arab and Jewish states, which was rejected by the Arabs. Around 1948, Israel was surrounded on three sides by the armies of three different Arab countries; outnumbered 10 to 1, and the Russians had pumped up the Arabs with superior fighter jets, artillery, and the usual weapons of warfare. <br>  <br>  There was no hope for Israel, all was surely lost. So what did they do? They attacked!  In one day, they wiped out the entire fleet of the enemy aircraft while it sat on the ground. Israel won the war against all odds.<br>  <br>  Israel was a very unpopular subject, even in the 1960’s, but by some incredible and miraculous intervention, Israel was declared a nation by the U.N., and reborn.<br>  <br>  In all of history, name one other nation that has been taken or destroyed, and come back into existence 2,000 years later (or at any later time) with the same government, the same culture, the same people (or descendants thereof), and the same religion as the Jews. Miraculous? Indeed, foretold. Prophesied by God. No man could possibly prophesy in such great detail, with such accuracy.<br>  <br>  No Tao or Koran or any other Bible stands up to such scrutiny, to such revelation, to such scouring truth as the Holy Bible. It is full of such prophesies, and it is full of such truth, that you cannot possibly find so much truth anywhere else.  As usual, as with gov’t and other things, it does not require much faith of our own when you know the origin, the details, and have knowledge of the subject. Faith comes through knowledge of the Bible. The answers are there, for anything and everything truly worthwhile that you seek. <br>  <br>  Please read the article titled "Essay" and the other titled "Finding Truth" at the below referenced link.|`|AA11550238	Where is Science in Evolution dude..<br>  <br>  Have you read the evolution theory with a Scietistific mentality .. ie questioning for experimental proof of every statement? <br>  <br>  Its simply imagination, one species evolving into other .. with all the missing links..  <br>  You have a dumb monkey ... and missing links and then suddendly you have A very evolved Human... ofcourse you show him naked to show him less evolved ..<br>  <br>  You get a some Jaw bone or even a tooth and you start imagining a Missing Link man ... what could be more further than science or Truth ? <br>  <br>  Evolution theory is another theory, and a Human attempt to some how understand Creation..

Now for your actual question:<br>  <br>  God's perfect plan is that none should perish, and he's commanded that we help this plan through preaching the gospel.  So that is how we affect/help it.

A man came up to her and said silly girl do you think you can make a differance, SHE threw another back and said .I DID FOR THAT ONE. <br>  Why because it helps us grow. Spreading love can make heaven here.Love feels good and God is love.<br>  I dont know what Gods plan is All I can do is do the next right thing and unless MY frontal lobe is damaged and I dont know Right from wrong,  If I ask God if I ask others I know what the right thing Is. The result might not be what I thought it would be but it is what it is and thats Gods plan.

5b1d604fa7114cdb7a4b93350eb4cfddaa	Tengo entendido que quien lo instauró fue Santo Domingo de Guzmán.<br>  Según la wikipedia,  el rosario comenzó a utilizarse alrededor del a?o 800. En los monasterios de ese entonces existía la costumbre de recitar los 150 salmos, pero los fieles que no eran sacerdotes ni monjes, al no poder seguir esta devoción (porque en su mayoría no sabía leer) se les ense?ó una práctica más sencilla: la de recitar 150 avemarías. Esta devoción tomó el nombre de "el salterio de la Virgen".<br>  <br>  Su popularidad y desarrollo se dio en el s. XIII, cuando surgió el movimiento albigense, un grupo de iluminados que negaban varias doctrinas esenciales de la Iglesia Católica y que llegó a convertirse en un grupo violento. Ante los enfrentamientos entre la Iglesia y los albigenses, santo Domingo de Guzmán, fundador de la orden de los Predicadores (más conocidos como dominicos), enfrentó a los albigenses con el rezo del Rosario.<br>  <br>  Según el relato católico, en 1214 Santo Domingo dijo haber recibido el primer rosario de manos de la propia Virgen María, en la primera de una serie de apariciones, como método de conversión de los no creyentes y de los pecadores. El Ave María tampoco existía antes de Santo Domingo, si bien en los primeros tiempos de la Iglesia ya existían ciertas oraciones a la Virgen María. Es con Santo Domingo desde donde se puede hablar del Rosario propiamente dicho.<br>  <br>  Al ser los dominicos una orden de predicadores y estar siempre en medio del pueblo, su devoción se hizo popular, generando la aparición de cofradías y grupos de devotos por doquier, junto con relatos de milagros que acrecentaron su fama. Aunque un siglo después de la muerte de Santo Domingo la devoción decayó, la orden de los Predicadores siguió fomentándola.|`|64324dcc1b21c24629df66638343ebedaa	no es un dogma. el rezo del santo rosario no es necesario para nuestra salvación, pero es muy recomendable.<br>  se dice que santo domingo de guzmán lo inventó en el siglo XII, pero lo único que él hizo fue darle orden a algo que ya hacían los cristianos en la baja edad media, mientras los clérigos rezaban los salmos de la liturgia de las horas. como ya no conocían el latín, y querían unirse a la oración, rezaban un ave maría por cada uno de los 150 salmos. se dice que para hacerlo, utilizaron en espa?a el rosario musulmán, pero con una finalidad distinta.<br>  santo domingo dividió las aves marías con el padre nuestro y el gloria en grupos de diez. y por medio de los misterios gozosos, dolorosos y gloriosos de la vida de jesús y de maría, dividió las 150 aves marías en tres grupos. en 2004, el papa juan pablo II agregó los misterios de luz, para completar así la reflexión en todos y cada uno de los misterios de la vida del se?or y de maría: desde la infancia, pasando por la vida, luego la muerte, hasta llegar a la resurrección y la gloria.|`|0c3ca77d59110317f7028885fac0d09eaa	Bueno el Santo que lo propago es Santo Domingo de Guzman<br>  La Virgen acude en ayuda de Santo Domingo de Guzmán<br>  <br>  La Virgen se le apareció en la capilla. En su mano sostenía un rosario y le ense?ó a Domingo a recitarlo. Dijo que lo predicara por todo el mundo, prometiéndole que muchos pecadores se convertirían y obtendrían abundantes gracias.<br>  <br>  Domingo salió de allí lleno de celo, con el rosario en la mano. Efectivamente, lo predicó, y con gran éxito por que muchos albingenses volvieron a la fe católica.<br>  <br>  Lamentablemente la situación entre albingences y cristianos estaba además vinculada con la política, lo cual hizo que la cosa llegase a la guerra. Simón de Montfort, el dirigente del ejército cristiano y a la vez amigo de Domingo, hizo que éste ense?ara a las tropas a rezar el rosario. Lo rezaron con gran devoción antes de su batalla más importante en Muret. De Montfort consideró que su victoria había sido un verdadero milagro y el resultado del rosario. Como signo de gratitud, De Montfort construyó la primera capilla a Nuestra Se?ora del Rosario.<br>  <br>  La Madre de Dios, en persona, le ense?ó a  Sto. Domingo a rezar el rosario en el a?o 1208 y le dijo que propagara esta devoción y la utilizara como arma poderosa en contra de los enemigos de la Fe.<br>  <br>  Desde ahi empieza la devocion al Rosario otras manifestaciones importantes es la intersecion de la Virgen en la batalla de Lepanto , la virgen de Fatima que propaga la devocion al Rosario.|`|AA10059786	Se lo copiaron a los musulmanes pero seguro que inventaron alguna historia para hacer pasar como un santo momento de iluminación.

A Palavra de Deus diz em JO?O CAP 14:6 <br>  disse Jesus.: EU SOU O CAMINHO A VERDADE E A VIDA .<br>  JESUS N?O DISSE ''eu sou um dos caminhos uma das verdades uma das vidas. Mais ele usou em nossa lingua o que chamamos de objeto direto o/a/ o problema é que a Biblia nos ensina a n?o adorarmos imagens de escultura, amar o proximo como a ti mesmo. O que vc deve fazer é ler a Biblia e pedir a DEUS  discernimento da mesma.<br>  Agora vou lhe explicar porque nós evangelicos pentecostais n?o aceitamos o ''ecumenismo'' Porque simplesmente só existe um Deus um só Senhor e um só Cristo.  entendeu me desculpe as seitas, filosofias e catolicos pois eu fico com a palavra de Deus pura e genuína. por isso nós evangelicos pentecostais genuínos n?o somos a favor de uni?o com outras religi?es e muito menos seremos ecumenistas.  <br>  Ps.  Aceita a Jesus Cristo como seu unico e suficiente Salvador.

Thus it is not surprising that any yogic activity begins with the performance of this deeply spiritual gesture. The Buddhists went further and gave it the status of a mudra, that is, a gesture displayed by deities, where it was known as the Anjali mudra. The word Anjali itself is derived from the root Anj, meaning "to adorn, honor, celebrate or anoint."<br>  <br>  According to Indologist Renov "Meditation depends upon the relationship between the hands (mudras), the mouth (mantras) and the mind (yoga)". The performance of namaste is comprised of all these three activities. Thus namaste is in essence equivalent to meditation, which is the language of our spirit in conversation with god, and the perfect vehicle for bathing us in the rivers of divine pleasure.

No se en que libros de historia has investigado, pero en lo poco que he leido, encuentro que el imperio mongol, fundado por el gran Khan, que abarco toda el Asia, y parte de Europa, tuvo cómo móviles la necesidad de apropiarse de nuevos territorios para pastoreo y cultivo de la tierra, debido a la aridez de las tierras que poseian. Igual la expansión del imperio Alejandrino, donde dice la historia que al llegar a Egipto, este se rindio, y posteriormente Alejandro Magno inicio la peregrinación hacia el templo del dios egipcio Amon-RA, para pedirle que lo hiciera su hijo. Lo que demuestra que Alejandro no llegó a imponer su sistema religioso sobre los pueblos conquistados, al contrario, cuando las circunstancias le favorecian se convertía a la religion de los sometidos. Las guerras napoleónicas, no son más que expansión territorial de Francia donde alcanzó a tomar casi toda Alemania a Austria y parte de Rusia entre otros. Las guerras contemporaneas, no se escapan a este mismo patrón, en el caso de los paises islámicos y judios se disfrazan de guerras santas, debido a los fanastismos carateristicos de estas culturas, pero su movil principal es el económico, sea territorios, petroleo o pasos estratégicos para el comercio o el transporte. En el caso de las potencias occidentales, con EEUU a la cabeza donde sus ciudadanos poseen una cultura más tendiente a la secularización, utilizan no el pretexto de la religión sino de la amenaza terrorista, para llevar a cabo sus proyectos de guerra en incursión en diferentes paises.|`|64324dcc1b21c24629df66638343ebedaa	?a cuáles fuentes te refieres? porque desde que existe el ser humano en el mundo ha venerado una divinidad, ?eh?<br>  y la culpa no es de las creencias sino de quienes las profesan.|`|cd25dda33045d9ec10903be7298751b6aa	Quien dice que HAY que creer en un unico Dios?

In ancient India cows were a form of wealth or currency. In farming communities a man's status was known by the number of cows he had.

I know this in the core of my being. I have a relationship with God and it gets stronger and stronger each day. There was a time not so long ago when I didn't really think much about God or eternal life after death, but when you really want to know Him and the promises He gives to those that believe Him, you will be like me waiting anxiously for His arrival. I really feel bad for those that don't believe that there is a higher power and a TRUE CREATOR. Sometimes science and logic can't explain everything, which is what we as humans want. But if you read His word in the Bible I don't know how anyone can dispute the fact that if the Bible were written thousands of years ago, how can the things in Revelations be foretold of things that are to come? Of course it doen't really matter what other groups, atheists and such would say towards my question because they  cannot convince me otherwise that MY GOD is just a figment of my imagination. One day they will all see. Think about it...Noah's Ark in Genisis. They made fun of Noah when God told him to build this boat because He was going to send a flood that would destroy the people and all living things on earth and that was near the very beginning of time when God was so distraught over the creatures He made and how much they hurt Him. History has once again repeated itself, now of course we are in the end. Look it up for those that don't believe. And tell me it's just coincidental. I don't believe in coincidences.

EVP proponents argue that the alleged voices are inexplicable by conventional science. Skeptics say there are prosaic explanations for the phenomenon that do not require communication from ghosts, spirits, or other paranormal sources<br>  Speculation about EVP can be traced back to the 1920s. In a Scientific American interview, Thomas Edison was quizzed on his views regarding contacting the dead. Edison said that it might be "possible to construct an apparatus which will be so delicate that if there are personalities in another existence or sphere who wish to get in touch with us in this existence or sphere, this apparatus will at least give them a better opportunity to express themselves than the tilting tables and raps and ouija boards and mediums and the other crude methods now purported to be the only means of communication." There is no indication that Edison designed or tried to construct such a device (though his speculations on the subject feature prominently in Tim Powers' novel Expiration Date).<br>  <br>  The basic assumption behind EVP belief is that spirits or other entities may find it easier to manipulate random noise than to move solid physical objects, speak through mediums, or to use other means of communication. Critics say that the use of electronic communication devices has opened up entirely new methods for self-deception and for charlatans to simulate contact with their clients' dead friends and loved ones. In most cases, they say, no fraud is needed since it is so easy for people to fool themselves when listening to or looking at random noise.[2] The human mind readily perceives meaningful patterns in random sounds or images that have no such patterns. Although these illusions called apophenia are pronounced in people who psychosis, they are also common in mentally healthy people. The common Rorschach inkblot psychological test makes use of people's ability to perceive meaning in completely meaningless patterns.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  History<br>  In 1901 a Russian American by the name of Waldemar Bogoras was an ethnologist studying the shaman of a remote Siberian tribe. Whilst recording the shaman beating his drum and entering a trance-like state many voices, coming from all around the room speaking in Russian and English, were captured on his crude phonograph. And also, from the very early 1900`s Marconi, Tesla and Edison spent the last years of their lives trying to develop devices for communicating with spirit. It is known that Edison had taken out some patents on various machines for communicating with the dead. Also, in 1967, in a post-mortem message, he made suggestions how to modify TV sets and to tune them to 740 megahertz for the express purpose of receiving paranormal effects.<br>  <br>  In 1933 there was a public demonstration of a seance in the New York studio of the World Broadcasting Company (that later became Decca). Four eminent parapsychologists and two reputable electrical engineers, under rigidly controlled test conditions, were shocked to hear many paranormal voices speaking to them. These entities even moved their voice levels high up into cycles which were way beyond the range of any human being, between 3 - 5,000 cycles. (This is incorrect. Healthy, young people hear in the range 20 - 20,000 Hertz) The results of this test were kept within the files of the ASPR (American Society for Psychicl Research).<br>  <br>  A Californian, Attila von Szalay, in 1936, started capturing paranormal voices on phonograph records and the in the mid 1950`s he was joined by Raymond Bayless. Together they acquired many evidential EVP on their new tape recorders and they published their findings in the Journal of the ASPR.<br>  <br>  About this time also, dozens of reports of intrusive voices of unknown origin from military and civilian installations world-wide were gathered together and put in the book by John Keel called OUR HAUNTED PLANET.<br>  <br>  A few years later in 1959, the so-called father of EVP, Friedrich Juergenson, a Russian born Swedish film producer, after recording birdsong on his tape-recorder, heard on playback what appeared to be a human voice. Subsequent recordings contained a message which seemed to be coming from his dead mother. This was the beginning of his lifelong involvement with the taped phenomena that became known as the RAUDIVE voices. He mentions his experiences in a book which made a deep impression on the Latvian psychologist Dr. Konstantin Raudive.<br>  <br>  It is significant that Juergenson`s work on the taped voices was made known to the Vatican in 1960 and his suggestion that these recordings are voices from the dead was sympathetically considered. In 1973, Archbishop Dr. Bruno Heim presented Juergenson to the Pope for investiture as Commander of the Order of St Gregory for his work.<br>  <br>  Since Jurgenson's report, thousands of people all over the world have attempted to replicate his experiments, and many have claimed success. Many people do not use specialized equipment to capture the voices, only a microphone and a means of recording, such as a tape/minidisc/CD recorder or a computer. Patience is required however, because many claim that it can take months of diligent recording before voices appear. Proponents recommend the use of headphones, because the voices are often faint, and a computer for processing the recordings is very helpful.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  In 1971 Raudive, along with the engineers of Pye Records conducted a controlled experiment in a special sound laboratory that blocked out all external radio and TV signals. Raudive`s voice was taped speaking into a microphone for 18 minutes and no other sounds were made or heard. However, on re-play over 200 extra voices were received.<br>  <br>  1971 was the year that Raudive`s book, BREAKTHROUGH, was published by Colin Smythe, in English and it is the book by which most EVP researchers of that day can pinpoint their entry into the field.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Instrumental transcommunication<br>  EVP is a subcategory of Instrumental transcommunication (ITC), which means the use of the tape recorder, video recorder, TV, radio, computer, telephone and other technical devices for the express purpose of getting meaningful information from the quantum realm in such forms as voices, images and text. In the case of telephones, many people report having received phone calls by someone claiming to be a deceased relative or a colleague. The voices can also manifest via the white noise between untuned stations on a radio.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Some of the most remarkable cases involve television and computers; a distorted image of a dead person's face will sometimes appear on a television screen, and some images even appear as a clear "full body" snapshot of the deceased individual, often standing in the foreground of a beautiful and peaceful looking backdrop. In some of these cases, the spirit will use the television to say that the scene behind them is an actual view of the "astral world", and that the background scene is depicted in order to reassure the living that their deceased loved ones are in a safe and "wonderful" place.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Proponents<br>  [edit]<br>  Proponents theory<br>  Spiritualists and those EVP organizations whose directors are members of the Spiritualist church e.g AA-EVP believe that they are in contact with human spirits who are said to have survived the deaths of their physical bodies, but are still able to communicate with the living. Most long-time researchers in this field will also agree that they have been in contact, at one time or another, with various astral entities who claim to have never incarnated as humans on the earthly plane. There are also those who claim to have been in contact with entities who have identified themselves as nature energies or as beings from "other worlds" (extraterrestrials), while some suggest that the sounds and images seen and heard on electronic equipment might be placed there by living human beings via a kind of psychokinesis. [citation needed]<br>  <br>  These "other types" of entities are oftentimes described as being either benevolent or trickster-type beings. Many reseachers have found that those trickster-type entities oftentimes seem to "evolve" into more benevolent-like personalities as time goes by. Nevertheless, proponents contend that EVP experimenters must develop a degree of discernment regarding all information recovered via EVP. Fortunately, proponents insist, the longer one engages in such experimentation, the better they are at discerning whom and where their information is coming from; this is usually based on the actual "content" of the information communicated to them. Proponents claim that EVP is the occurrence of sounds or voices on an audio recording which were not produced by known means. [citation needed] Oftentimes these sounds or voices were not heard by the unaided physical ear of the recorder during their EVP recording session. To some, this suggests the possibility that the voices or sounds were produced directly on the recording device via psychokinesis, or were audible outside the range of human hearing, possibly produced by psychokinetic manipulation of sound waves. [1]<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Skeptics<br>  Those who are skeptical of paranormal phenomena insist that there are more plausible explanations for EVP. The Skeptic's Dictionary summarises a number of common observations on the subject: "While it is impossible to prove that all EVPs are due to natural phenomena, skeptics maintain that they are probably due to such things as interference from a nearby CB operator or cross modulation. The phenomena has been recorded in Faraday cages since 1970`s at Pye Electronics in the UK. Some of the 'voices' are most likely people creating meaning out of random noise, a kind of auditory pareidolia or apophenia. Now that the phenomenon has a number of devoted followers some hoaxers have probably entered the fray."<br>  <br>  Another possible explanation is that people may have used old tapes for EVP sessions, and that the voices they hear come from a previous recording "bleeding through". There are several cases of people being spooked by what turned out to be voices from a radio program or a nearby baby monitor, suggesting that many unexplained voice phenomenon could have equally mundane origins. When using language, humans are constantly sorting out noise, recognizing speech patterns and so on, all unconsciously.<br>  <br>  This training can also make us pick up words that are not even there, just as it can make people hear something other than what was said. Digital audio recording devices may also be chosen on the basis of a poor Signal-to-noise ratio, believing that they are more "sensitive" to "life energies". Poor quality A/D and DACs on cheaper digital recorders create artifacts not present from the ambience being recorded. For digital voice recorders, the audio compression is also tuned to record only to the frequency bands optimal for properly recognizing the human voice, all other bands are discarded. Any static will therefore not be broad-spectrum and may be confused with garbled speech.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Recording EVP<br>  The quality, volume and durations of recordings are said to be increased by using a sound source placed within audible distance of the microphone during recording. Typically this would be a radio tuned to between stations so only white noise is audible; the theory being that this provides an acoustic basis for the voices to be constructed from, similar to vocoder technology.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  This need for background noise fits the alternative explanation that the white noise provides random sounds that may be interpreted as voices by people who expect or want to hear voices. This explanation is consistent with the theory that the entire "phenomenon" is an example of pareidolia, in which a vague or random stimulus is mistakenly perceived as recognizable (see the skeptic section).<br>  <br>  Voices are said to be known for being rapid, faint, and often spoken in grammatically unusual and simplified language—or even multiple languages during the same sentence. The interpretation of such recordings is often highly subjective and may differ from listener to listener; some listeners may hear nothing at all, while others report hearing specific phrases or sentences.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Studies<br>  [edit]<br>  Raudive voices<br>  Taking their inspiration from Jürgenson, EVP phenomena were investigated by the German parapsychologist Hans Bender and by the Latvian psychologist Konstantin Raudive. Following the publication of Raudive's book on his research (Breakthrough, 1971) these phenomena are now often referred to as "Raudive Voices".<br>  <br>  Professor Bender, notable parapsychologist from the University of Freiburg, eventually wrote in his conclusion that these voices were `susceptible to a paranormal interpretation`.<br>  <br>  In a recent post-mortem message to a German researcher he had this to say: `Free yourself from the rigid conduct of tradition and open yourself to the new forms of probability. Your system of reality is one of countless others and all are happening at the same time. The frequency of our own reality is so short that it cannot be perceived by you`.<br>  <br>  The only other scientist of note ever to have personally studied EVP and other forms of ITC for many, many years is Professor Ernst Senkowski, a physicist with a degree on electron acceleration. He came to the conclusion that the phenomena strongly upheld the Spiritualistic hypothesis that the so-called dead are alive and that they have `found new ways of reaching us`.<br>  <br>  Dr Konstantin Raudive (1906-1974), a student of Carl Jung, was a psychologist who taught at the University of Uppsala in Sweden. He was preoccupied with parapsychological interests all his life (especially with the possibility of life after death), and he kept in close contact with leading British psychical researchers.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  In 1964, Raudive read Jürgenson's book, Voices from Space, and was so impressed by it that he arranged to meet Jürgenson in 1965. He then worked with Jürgenson to make some EVP recordings, but their first efforts bore little fruit, although they believed that they could hear very weak, muddled voices. However, one night, as he listened to one recording, he clearly heard a number of voices. When he played the tape over and over, he came to understand all of them, some of which were in German, some in Latvian, some in French. The last voice on the tape, a woman's voice, said "Va dormir, Margarete" ("Go to sleep, Margaret").<br>  <br>  Raudive later wrote (in his book Breakthrough): "These words made a deep impression on me, as Margarete Petrautzki had died recently, and her illness and death had greatly affected me." Amazed by this, he started researching such voices on his own and spent much of the last ten years of his life exploring electronic voice phenomena. With the help of various electronics experts he recorded over 100,000 audiotapes, most of which were made under what he described as "strict laboratory conditions." He collaborated at times with Bender. Over 400 people were involved in his research, and all apparently heard the voices. This culminated in the 1971 publication of his book Breakthrough, mentioned above.<br>  <br>  Raudive developed several different approaches to recording EVP, and he referred to:<br>  <br>  Microphone voices: one simply leaves the tape recorder running, with no one talking; he indicated that one can even disconnect the microphone. <br>  Radio voices: one records the white noise from a radio that is not tuned to any station. <br>  Diode voices: one records from what is essentially a crystal set not tuned to a station. <br>  Raudive delineated a number of characteristics of the voices, (as laid out in Breakthrough):<br>  <br>  "The voice entities speak very rapidly, in a mixture of languages, sometimes as many as five or six in one sentence." <br>  "They speak in a definite rhythm, which seems forced on them." <br>  "The rhythmic mode imposes a shortened, telegram-style phrase or sentence." <br>  Probably because of this, "... grammatical rules are frequently abandoned and neologisms abound." <br>  In a post-mortem message in 1988 Raudive stated:<br>  <br>  "Man as a partially space-timeless entity belongs to many different fields and dimensions."<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Spiricom<br>  From the mid-1960s to the early-1980s, research was conducted by the "Metascience Foundation", formerly based in Franklin, North Carolina, on the development of a system of communication with the dead. Two inventors, George W. Meek and William J. O'Neil, supposedly developed a machine containing sophisticated audio electronics that allowed actual two-way conversation with the afterlife. They called it Spiricom. Unlike EVP, where an investigator has to wait and playback a recording to hear disembodied voices, the Spiricom device allowed real-time two-way communication (or "Direct Voice") from beyond the grave. The project was officially defined as "An electromagnetic-etheric systems approach to communications with other levels of human consciousness".[citation needed]<br>  <br>  At least five Spiricom machines were said to have been constructed, (named the Mark I through Mark V respectively), each a major improvement over the other previous design. The first systems worked by using a high-frequency white noise generator that would provide a "carrier" wave for a ghost's actual voice. The theory was, if a ghost could record itself to magnetic media such as video cassette or audio tape via manipulating electromagnetic frequencies, the entity could manipulate the electromagnetic fields produced by the Spiricom machine and create a synthetic voice over a speaker through the oscillator of the noise generator.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Experiments began in Philadelphia sometime in 1972. Experimenters claimed that a psychic medium contacted a spirit and "guided" it to the test device. Initially, the Mark I did not produce communication and simply made unexplained buzzing and popping noises, however Meek believed this was an entity trying to communicate. The researchers claimed to take into account possible interference from a nearby airport control tower and devised better shielding for the device.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  In 1974, the Mark II was made and was allegedly much more successful. The first somewhat coherent voices were heard although they were very difficult to understand. From the parts of the audio that were comprehensible, the entity claimed the machine was difficult to use.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  It wasn't until 1977 when the Spiricom Mark III and Mark IV had been built and produced a more stable sound output with microwave emitters and better shielding that more meaningful communication was perceived.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Though various question and answer sessions with at least three separate entities, (one of which claimed to have died in 1830), the alleged beings supposedly described the events of their death and what it was like on the "other side", saying it was just another level of human consciousness. They supposedly mentioned there are several levels in fact and they supposedly exist among them as mental energy without a physical body. They claim to "see" psychics and the Spiricom device itself as pathways of "light" that they can channel through to the material world and make communication.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Proponents insist that the best reported contact was on April 16, 1980. Meeks and O'Neil claimed they were able to talk to a very clear voice of a deceased physicist, Dr. George Jeffries Mueller, who died on May 31, 1967 from a heart condition. Mueller claimed he was once an associate professor of engineering and mathematics at Orange Coast College, in Costa Mesa, California, and had also worked for at time with NASA. Mueller's voice sounded like a robot, buzzing through hissing background noise.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Meeks and O'Neil claim to have spent months recording many hours of audio with Mueller's spirit, who even helped them "tune him in" better and advised them of how to improve the Spricom device. Supposedly, other entities also tried to talk through the machine, however these communications did not last as long as Mueller's or were very incomprehensible. Some, according to Mueller, were unable to use the device at all. After some time, communication with Mueller was said to become less frequent. Sometimes the spirit would not speak for weeks, and eventually, communication with him ended completely. Spiricom research ended in early 1982.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Spiricom was hardly publicized, if at all, and most reports on the subject have fallen into pseudoscience and obscurity. Many skeptics believe the Spricom experiment is a complete fraud. A few amateur audio enthusiasts have tried to recreate the experiments and claim various degrees of success.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The Spiricom audio tapes of Dr. Mueller have been played on Art Bell's "Coast to Coast AM" radio program. Some of these audio clips can be downloaded from this website: Spiricom MP3's. The Spiricom reports are available for free download from this website: Spiricom Device, including the plans and research papers with technical instructions and diagrams on how to build your own Spiricom device. Meeks and O'Neil patented the device, but they allow anyone to make their own, "royalty free", and conduct further research and development, so long as that person agrees never to sell the research for profit.|`|3302f2e8545deb04164c3e576894e4f7aa	I don't know, never heard of it and not sure I want to!

Now those Holstein Cows and their reverse psychology and that little gecko and those crows flying into that patio door and all of those other animals tempt me. Most animals are pretty truthful. A horse will tell you that he is still hungry and founder and a pig will convince you that he is filthy while he is actually one of the cleanest animals on the farm or ranch but all in all animals are pretty honest. I don't take anything or anybody at their word anymore except ranchers out in Southwest Texas and they have to be at least sixty-five and not be gifted with a line of BS.

But if a celebrity endorses it you can be sure that a very large percentage of what you are paying for it goes to the celebrity and also to the TV ads and little for the manufacture of the products.  I am old enough to remember when Joe Namath was selling pantyhose, and wore a pair as a "celebrity" endorsement.  I think Orange County and Hollywood have the highest rates for plastic surgery of anywhere in the US, they don't need to give so much credit for any of the products that they are selling.

My ex-boyfriend, however, was born and raised in Ontario, so he had very little Spanish exposure. To me, trying to learn French was a great challenge whereas learning Spanish came pretty easily. It was the exact opposite situation for my ex. <br>  <br>  Of course, some people have a natural aptitude for learning languages and will have no problem with either while others have trouble with languages and will find both challenging.

He's the last person on earth I would expect such behaviour.<br>  <br>  However, to me, he is showing his respect to nature.  A positive attitude never fails.  To believe in the Fish god when everyone on earth ignores him is to be blessed with abundance of fish.

Gf5nMPJXaa	If you knew what atheism meant you'd realize this is a silly and irrational question, much akin to seeing who is the champion non-golfer or the most adept non-stamp collector.<br>  <br>  Atheism is the lack of an attribute, not a cause.<br>  <br>  At the very closest possibility you might ask if someone were willing to die for the freedom from religious hegemony.  But why would an atheist even do that?  What purpose is served unless and until belief and thoughts can be detected?  <br>  <br>  If, as is not all that impossible, Xianity were mandated by law I would simply go along and mouth the words.  To what end would my martyrdom be applied?  Nobody can force me to believe a certain way, only to act a certain way.  Dying for atheism would be nothing more than, and as irrational as, dying for a few hours extra in bed on Sundays if and when Xianity becomes law.

With the mouth confession is made.|`|4ed8d579ee0af5d6e7a8076753bd36aaaa	Of course you will.  There are many Christians all over the world where they could not go to the church to worship.  They gathered at home with their families and studied and prayed together to God.  That also happened duirng the early days of the Christian when they were persecuted and hunted.  Nowadays there are places in the world where communism and other religions persecuted the Christians, and they have to do the same thing.<br>  <br>  But if you are a real Chrsitian, and the opportunity is there, it is unreasonable not to want to join with fellow Christians to worship God together.<br>  But of course there is an exception to everything.  Sometimes we see or meet Christians whose characters are abhoring, so we feel repulsed into joining them, and decided to worship by ourselves with our family and close friends at hom.<br>  <br>  Remember that it is not the church who saves us, but Jesus Christ.  And He said, that where two or three gather in His name, He will be present in His Spirit.  So  just look at the situation and see how best to adapt yourself to the circumstances.  God bless you.|`|4f04d4786a54a232956eb63026d6b825aa	If you truly believe that Jesus is your Lord and Savior, that he died for your sins, its the least you can do to take one hour out of one day of the week to say thanks.<br>  And for prayer, prayer is, among other things, to give thanks for all God has given you (your life, everything you have) and to ask for things you need (I'm sure there are a few, at least).<br>  And though one can theoretically get to heaven without these things, why risk it when you have the tools to be sure?|`|6e27d4fb025ac2c2f68faa0fba30dffbaa	of course|`|744c700a967520e2c1b49ac0b96ff40eaa	Of course, you silly goose.  You cannot go to Heaven by just attending church or else many of us will go to Hell.  Take a hint from my religion, whihc is Marin.  Sometimes when I am down on my luck or short on cash, I can attend a shrine and "order" a meal in any quantity I choose.  This symbolizes the panentheist belief that those who go to Heaven will have to "pay their way" once they are IN HEAVEN.  I know the shrines are called "fast-food restaurants," but that is because of the rligious nature, not the rate of cooking.  I would rather wait 20 minutes for a steak to be prepared, hence the allegory of the ant and the grasshopper.  I know you will go to Heaven because I can see the essence of your soul radiating from your heart.  I can sense the maturity you deplict and the const of this essence, which was paid by Jesus Christ through hhis blood.  Pardon my scattering, but my religion originated from Christianity, and for yourself as a Christian, you have the greatest advantage, and that is to attend any congregation of any faith you can imagine.  The purpose of Christianity is to "go ye, and preach the Gospel."  do not worry about church and start worrying about faith.|`|8538ad03f1dcbfc1b7d53fe9d1cc862faa	Of course you will go to heaven, since there is no where else to go.

God never judges anyone for anything...ever!!!<br>  <br>  God sees us for what we truly are...and he wouldn't judge us any more than we would judge an actor on the stage for behaving like the character he/she is playing. Even if the actor forgets that he is not that character, God does not forget it.

Unless you trust God with ALL your heart and know that Jesus' death on the cross washed are sins away leaving us a choice to follow him up to heaven or go down the lowest of the low and then accept that gift to follow him, THEN you will be saved. It sounds like a lot of words but basically this explains it: (Romans 10:9) - That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.- And there is no telling of when the Rapture comes.

That's with or without a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  The Gospels tell us that Christ did not reveal that.  It keeps us honest, because then it's up to us to be "good" for the right reasons such as the love of God and our neighbors, and not try to be "good just in case it's on Dec 21, 2012, like the Mayans prophecized".  That's even assuming that we know what the Mayans meant with Dec 21, 2012, which we don't.

Love thy neighbour as thy self is one of the top instructions Christ gave. As for the 20yrs left - that is rubbish too - the bible says no one not even Christ knows when that day will come.This person obviously does not read or understand his bible and has been brainwashed by someone I suspect.  Remind him of the words of Christ to his people - Judge not - lest you be judged. Why can't he have a girlfriend - there is no where in the bible that says you can't have a girlfriend or get married.  He certainly does not appear to believe in the Jesus I believe in.  He may have also missed a critical point - When Christ returns it is said that he himself will rule the world fairly for a time - in the hope that all will prefer his way of living i.e. peace to all men.  Then after that period of time things are supposedly going to dramatically change and it says that there will be a new heaven and a new earth.  Ask him if he believes that the devil is able to get into heaven.  He will probably scoff and say No..refer him to the following verses below. I wonder what his response will be. I answered another question earlier in response to Pan's question.  Is this really how Christians think?  - I wrote quite a long piece but there will be more information for you to challenge him with if you look at my response to Pans question there.

Jesus commanded the demons to leave a person. They requested that they be allowed to go into the pigs, He allowed them to. Jesus owns everything and has firm control of demons. They do nothing without His permission<br>  <br>  Third,<br>  1.Mat_21:19<br>  And when he saw a fig-tree in the way ... - This tree was standing in the public road.<br>  It was therefore common property and anyone might lawfully use its fruit. Mark says Mar_11:13, “Seeing a fig-tree afar off, having leaves, he came,” etc. Not far off “from the road,” but at a considerable distance from the place where he was. Having loaves, and appearing healthy and luxuriant, they presumed that there would be fruit on it. Mark says Mar_11:13, “he came, if haply he might find anything thereon.” That is, judging from the “appearance” of the tree, it was “probable” that there would be fruit on it. We are not to suppose that our Lord was ignorant of the true condition of the tree, but he acted according to the appearance of things; being a man as well as divine, he acted, of course, as people do act in such circumstances.<br>  And found nothing thereon but leaves only - Mark Mar_11:13 gives as a reason for this that “the time of figs was not yet.” That is, the time “of gathering” the figs was not yet, or had not passed. It was a time when figs were ripe or suitable to eat, or he would not have gone to it, expecting to find them; but the time of gathering them had not passed, and it was to be presumed that they were still on the tree. This took place on the week of the Passover, or in the beginning of April. Figs, in Palestine, are commonly ripe at the Passover. The summer in Palestine begins in March, and it is no uncommon thing that figs should be eatable in April. It is said that they sometimes produce fruit the year round.<br>  Mark Mar_11:12-13 says that this took place on the morning of the day on which he purified the temple. Matthew would lead us to suppose that it was on the day following. Matthew records briefly what Mark records more “fully.” Matthew states the fact that the fig-tree was barren and withered away, without regarding minutely the order or the circumstances in which the event took place. There is no contradiction, because Matthew does not affirm that this took place on the morning after the temple was cleansed, though he places it in that order; nor does he say that a day did not elapse after the fig-tree was cursed before the disciples discovered that it was withered, though he does not affirm that it was so. Such circumstantial variations, where there is no positive contradiction, go greatly to confirm the truth of a narrative. They show that the writers were honest men, and did not “conspire” to deceive the world.<br>  And said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee ... - Mark calls this “cursing” the tree Mar_11:21. The word “curse,” as used by him, does not imply “anger,” or disappointment, or malice. It means only “devoting it to destruction,” or causing it to wither away. All the “curse” that was pronounced was in the words “that no fruit should grow on it.” The Jews used the word “curse” not as always implying “wrath or anger,” but to devote to “death,” or to any kind of destruction, Heb_6:8. It has been commonly thought that the Saviour performed this miracle to denote the sudden “withering away” or destruction of the Jewish people. They, like the fig-tree, promised fair. That was full of leaves, and they full of professions. Yet both were equally barren; and as that was destroyed, so they were soon to be. It was certain that this would be a good “illustration” of the destruction of the Jewish people, but there is no evidence that Jesus intended it as such, and without such evidence we have no right to say that was its meaning. “And presently the fig-tree withered away.” That is, before another day. See Mark. It is probable that they were passing directly onward, and did not stop then to consider it. Matthew does not affirm that it withered “away in their presence,” and Mark affirms that they made the discovery on the morning after it was “cursed.”|`|b21ce93081c9631aa31ce097c8602bc1aa	Racist comments about the cannanites?<br>  Just where in the bible did he do that?<br>  Why bother with this stupid questions of yours?

He was a Jewish Rabbi, no more or no less human than you or I.  It was the Paulines (followers of Paul the Apostate) who who turned him into the suffering servant Messiah who was perfect, was it not?<br>  <br>  Second of all, Jesus was racist just like most Jews of his time.  However, he overcame his prejudice later on.  Look at the parable of the Good Samaritan.  The Samaritans were hated more than the Canaanites by the Jews.

How can one be God Centered and more worried about comparing their lives to other peoples and coming up superior to other people when in fact we should examine our lives and compare them to the Lord's when He was here and then we will come up short every time.  It is like some Christians forget we are on a journey and have not arrived yet.

3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	THE Christmas spirit is not Christian, because it did not originate with Christ. It predated the Christian era by many centuries. Shortly after the Flood the spirit and the whole celebration of Christmas had its beginning. It began with Nimrod, grandson of Ham the son of Noah, a wicked, ruthless dictator, responsible for the great organized worldly apostasy from God that continues to this day. In contempt for God and all decency Nimrod married his own mother, Semiramis. After his untimely death, his mother-wife, Semiramis, taught the lie that her husband-son was a spirit god. She claimed a full-grown evergreen tree sprang overnight from a dead tree stump, which symbolized the springing forth to new life of the dead Nimrod. She taught that on the anniversary of his birth, which was December 25, Nimrod would visit the evergreen tree and leave gifts upon it. The historian, Professor Hislop, says: “Now the Yule Log is the dead stock of Nimrod, deified as the sun-god, but cut down by his enemies; the Christmas-tree is Nimrod redivivus—the slain god come to life again.”—The Two Babylons, pages 97, 98.<br>  <br>  This is the starting of Christmas with its spirit. This is also the origin of the yule log, the Christmas tree, the celebrating of birthdays, the spirit of exchanging gifts, the spirit of feasting and merrymaking, visits and salutations, jocularity, revelry and drunkenness. All, is an outgrowth of the first lie, encouraged by the spirit of Satan the Devil, who told it. In Eden to Eve he said: “You positively will not die. For God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God, knowing good and bad.” Like Eve, Semiramis believed Satan’s lie and proclaimed Nimrod as a spirit god. With this declaration a wild celebration began on his birthday that has continued down through the centuries to our day. In.the Western world it is called Christmas.<br>  <br>  As regards your followup question, the answer is simple.<br>  If these customs started in ancient Babylon, they were spread throughout the earth when God confused the languages of the people. The result was people were scattered from one end of the earth to the other.|`|AA11888411	its pagan in origin......can't remember the story though.|`|38c0e4ca4b4939a947032a4b8b886348aa	Because my mom (from England) talked of the Yule Log, I thought it was an English tradition, until I read the following:<br>  <br>  "A Yule log is a large log which is burned in the hearth as a part of traditional Yule or Christmas celebrations in some cultures.<br>  <br>  In Northern Europe, winter festivities were once considered to be a Feast of the Dead, complete with ceremonies full of spirits, devils, and the haunting presence of the Norse god, Odin, and his night riders.

It was also believed that as long as the Yule Log burned, the house would be protected from witchcraft.

Sometimes He uses it in connection with His earthy mission, but He also uses it when describing His final triumph as Redeemer and Judge (Matt. 16:27f; 19:28; 24:30; 25:31).

My Aunt was murdered and it took me many years to let myself forgive the man who did it. I had too because the hatred was eating me up inside. I tried to "force" myself to forgive because my religion told me I should for a long time, but I was not personally ready. Finally, I had to just look inside myself and and make it a personal decision based on what I could and could not live with and what I knew to be right within my heart as well as what I felt that my Aunt would have wanted me to do at that point. When I looked at it from THAT perspective it really all just came together and I felt good about the forgiveness.

Por ejemplo:<br>  <br>  Shaurasenii lenguaje de Shuurasena<br>  (región de Mathuraa, comúnmente llamada Muttra) <br>  Maagadhii lenguaje de Magadha (región de Patna) <br>  Maahaaraastrii, comúnmente llamado maraathii lenguaje de Mahaaraastra<br>  (país de los Maraatha-s, comúnmente llamados Mahratta-s) <br>  <br>  No obstante, no hay necesariamente un dialecto local como base para cada lengua Praakrita. Los Prakrita-s son idiomas literarios que han sido pulidos y establecidos artificialmente por teorizantes (de la misma manera que el Dórico en los coros de la tragedia griega). Sus particularidades no son ni completamente irreales ni están absolutamente de conformidad con la realidad del lenguaje hablado.<br>  <br>  Algunos de ellos presentan una mezcla en la cual predominan las reminiscencias del Sánscrito. De este modo, el Paishaacii, aunque se base en una lengua del noroeste solamente reproduce en sí misma algunos rasgos dialectales. Gunaadhya, el que lo estableció, no perdió de vista las reglas sánscritas.<br>  <br>  Independientemente de los praakrita-s, los Deshabhaasaa-s (idiomas regionales) y los Graamyabhaasaa-s (idiomas locales) continuaron desarrollándose. Dieron nacimiento al lenguaje escrito llamado Apabhramshá por los gramáticos. Aún cuando esta lengua es a menudo confudida con un praakrita, fue originalmente una forma intermedia entre los lenguajes locales y los praakrita-s.<br>  <br>  Al lado de las lenguas literarias, en India existieron algunos idiomas religiosos. El más famoso es el paali. El cánon buddhista conservado en Ceylán fue escrito en Paali (siglo I a. de J.C.). Su origen es seguramente continental, pero su fuente es difícil de trazar porque no es homogéneo. Sus elementos esenciales proceden de la región de Maalva (norte de Indore), pero muchos elementos heterogéneos se le han agregado. El Paali ha mantenido su posición como uno de los lenguajes religiosos del Buddhismo.<br>  <br>  A su vez, la lengua de los Jainas ha también alcanzado la posición de lengua religiosa. El principal idioma de los Jainas nació en Magadha (donde se escribió el cánon Jainista). Este lenguaje fue transportado cuando el centro de la región se trasladó a Dekkan y Guzrate, y adoptó ciertos caracteres que lo acercan al Maaharaastrii.|`|abd8305a076537d45cbd84cb36edc4e9aa	Pues hay muchiiiiiiiiisimas lenguas, pero el idioma oficial y el q todos hablan es el inglés.<br>  Luego hablan el hindi, q supongo q sera el mas extendido, despues del inglés.|`|f873e12a449f0b07c0ec88bcd0a618f7aa	idioma oficial ingles<br>  idioma nativo hindi|`|00c4575978d95ed843cee802293e0122aa	creo que hindu|`|33803bcd9597f631525ef1ede22b1a03aa	Si sabes inglès, puedes viajar tranquila que todos te entenderan<br>  Bye|`|6b442787d674bb580a40cef937fa3138aa	indi|`|762e668fe52037e6560aff281268c2f6aa	Idiomas<br>  <br>  La India tiene 844 dialectos y 17 lenguas principales como el panjabí, el [[hindí [??????], el Bengalí, el Maratí, el Tamil, el Telugú, el Kannada, el Malayalam. 1|`|93b1ca87851a5beb36611194a8b228f6aa	Idiomas oficiales: Hindi, Inglés + 21 idiomas oficiales|`|f00a2840c8a4c4a947449e07c68da931aa	hablan indu los de la india|`|4855985464add87b5e59b9c01150d20daa	Indiano?|`|1ed19dc6cc84e5075b820704477712a3aa	La lengua oficial de la India es el hindí o hindú e ingles;aunque tienen  problemas étnicos ligados a la heterogeneidad de las poblaciones y de las lenguas...<br>  Debes leer su historia para que entiendas mas,ya que es muy compleja para definirla en este sitio...también hay musulmanes allá...<br>  La india es el segundo país mas poblado del mundo!<br>  <br>  NOTA:te debo las palabras que pediste ya que mi ordenador no tiene programas en ese idioma y no me salen...|`|09e4a235e55842860dfd5d0bd8dd2750aa	hindi e ingles|`|2bb52f07465cf74f721596d32d3af93faa	que yo sepa son 5, pero el unico que me se el nombre es el Indi.|`|76eb6b1f126b52794ace57bf6f161e69aa	...Hablan Ingles pero tambien hablan Hindi<br>  <br>  Namaste o Namaskar: Saludo de profundidad, tambien se puede usar para "Bienvenido" es un saludo espiritual, referente al Hinduismo.<br>  Satsriakal: Hola<br>  Kiale:Como estas?<br>  Pyar: Amor<br>  <br>  ...Entre muchos otros...|`|8da2ee76c35104a3977716a0edf09c03aa	indigenas... jejejeje saludos

fb68ec9c03fb8dfe0583ffb16ea62572aa	Could Noah's Ark really hold all the animals that were supposed to be preserved from Flood?<br>  <br>  A growing number of scientists believe that geological evidence indicates our world has undergone a catastrophic flood. This is causing them to question whether or not the biblical account of Noah's ark could be true. Many people are rereading the Biblical description of the Ark to ascertain the feasibility of such a vessel to fulfill its designated purpose in light of present day knowledge of both zoology and our present day knowledge of shipbuilding.<br>  <br>  Size comparison between average size one-story home and Noah's Ark. Illustration from The World that Perished.How big was Noah's Ark?<br>  <br>  "And God said unto Noah… Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt though make in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of… the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A window shalt thou make in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side therof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it." (Gen. 6:14-16)<br>  <br>  A cubit is the distance between an adult's elbow and tip of the finger, no less than 18-inches [45.72 centimeters]. (Scene from The World that Perished.)Most Hebrew scholars believe the cubit to have been no less than 18 inches long [45.72 centimeters]. This means that the ark would have been at least 450 feet long [137.16 meters], 75 feet wide [22.86 meters] and 45 feet high [13.716000000000001 meters]. Noah's Ark was said to have been the largest sea-going vessel ever built until the late nineteenth century when giant metal ships were first constructed. Its length to width ratio of six to one provided excellent stability on the high seas. In fact, modern shipbuilders say it would have been almost impossible to turn over. In every way, it was admirably suited for riding out the tremendous storms in the year of the flood.<br>  <br>  These dimensions are especially interesting when compared to those given in the mythical, Babylonian account of the Ark. Here the ark is described as a perfect cube, extending 120 cubits in all directions and with nine decks. Such a vessel would spin slowly round and round in the water and from the standpoint of stability, would be a disaster.<br>  <br>  Was the ark big enough to hold the number of animals required?<br>  The total available floor space on the ark would have been over 100,000 square feet, which would be more floor space than in 20 standard-sized basketball courts.<br>  <br>  Assuming an 18-inch cubit [45.72 centimeters], Noah's Ark would have had a cubic volume equal to 569 modern railroad stock cars.The total cubic volume would have been 1,518,000 cubic feet [462,686.4 cubic meters] --that would be equal to the capacity of 569 modern railroad stock cars.<br>  <br>  Now comes the question, how many land dwelling air breathing animals would have had to be taken aboard the ark to survive the flood?<br>  <br>  According to Ernest Mayr, America's leading taxonomist, there are over 1 million species of animals in the world.<br>  <br>  God only provided the Ark for the protection of humans and land-dwelling, air-breathing creatures. A huge number of animals would not need to be taken aboard the Ark because they are water dwellers. Representatives would be expected to survive the catastrophe. With God's protection against extinction during the Deluge, survival would have been assured. (Scene from The World that Perished, a Christian motion picture about the Flood)However, the vast majority of these are capable of surviving in water and would not need to be brought aboard the ark. Noah need make no provision for the 21,000 species of fish or the 1,700 tunicates (marine chordates like sea squirts) found throughout the seas of the world, or the 600 echinoderms including star fish and sea urchins, or the 107,000 mollusks such as mussels, clams and oysters, or the 10,000 coelenterates like corals and sea anemones, jelly fish and hydroids or the 5,000 species of sponges, or the 30,000 protozoans, the microscopic single-celled creatures.<br>  <br>  In addition, some of the mammals are aquatic. For example, the whales, seals and porpoises. The amphibians need not all have been included, nor all the reptiles, such as sea turtles, and alligators. Moreover, a large number of the arthropods numbering 838,000 species, such as lobsters, shrimp, crabs and water fleas and barnacles are marine creatures. And the insect species among arthropoda are usually very small. Also, many of the 35,000 species of worms as well as many of the insects could have survived outside the Ark.<br>  <br>  How many animals needed to be brought aboard?<br>  Doctors Morris and Whitcomb in their classic book,The Genesis Flood state that no more than 35,000 individual animals needed to go on the ark. In his well documented book, Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study, John Woodmorappe suggests that far fewer animals would have been transported upon the ark. By pointing out that the word "specie" is not equivalent to the "created kinds" of the Genesis account, Woodmorappe credibly demonstrates that as few as 2,000 animals may have been required on the ark. To pad this number for error, he continues his study by showing that the ark could easily accommodate 16,000 animals.)<br>  <br>  But, let's be generous and add on a reasonable number to include extinct animals. Then add on some more to satisfy even the most skeptical. Let's assume 50,000 animals, far more animals than required, were on board the ark, and these need not have been the largest or even adult specimens.<br>  <br>  Remember there are really only a few very large animals, such as the dinosaur or the elephant, and these could be represented by young ones. Assuming the average animal to be about the size of a sheep and using a railroad car for comparison, we note that the average double-deck stock car can accommodate 240 sheep. Thus, three trains hauling 69 cars each would have ample space to carry the 50,000 animals, filling only 37% of the ark. This would leave an additional 361 cars or enough to make 5 trains of 72 cars each to carry all of the food and baggage plus Noah's family of eight people. The Ark had plenty of space.<br>  <br>  The bigger problem would have been the construction of the Ark. But the Bible indicates that Noah did this under Divine guidance and there is no reason to believe he did not hire additional workmen.<br>  <br>  How were the animals gathered?<br>  <br>  Another enormous problem some have posed is the problem of gathering specimens of each kind of air-breathing land animal and bringing them aboard the Ark. However, the Genesis account indicates that God gathered the animals and brought them to Noah inside the ark two by two. Some have suggested this may have involved the origin of animal migratory instincts or, at least, an intensification of it. We also know that most animals possess the ability to sense danger and to move to a place of safety.<br>  <br>  How could Noah's family take care of all those animals?<br>  <br>  Noah with the animals, as depicted in the motion picture, The World that Perished.Once aboard, many have suggested that Noah's problems really began, with only 8 people to feed and water, to provide fresh air and sanitation for the huge menagerie of animals for a total of 371 days. However, a number of scientists have suggested that the animals may have gone into a type of dormancy. It has been said that in nearly all groups of animals there is at least an indication of a latent ability to hibernate or aestivate. Perhaps these abilities were supernaturally intensified during this period. With their bodily functions reduced to a minimum, the burden of their care would have been greatly lightened.<br>  <br>  Conclusion:<br>  It is evident, when all the facts are examined that there is no scientific evidence that the biblical account of Noah's ark is a myth or fable. The facts support the view that Noah's ark was large enough to carry the number of animals required to repopulate the earth after the flood and that Noah and his family were capable of caring for the animals during their time on the Ark.<br>  <br>  Here is the site that I found that answers your question.. :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-c..." rel="nofollow">http://christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-c...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, read it all...how they took care of animals is there...inbreeding can be common in animals, plus what about G-d's will?<br>  <br>  If you want to deny it, feel free.

AA11165900	First of all, there are many sects of Buddhism, Mahayana and Theravada and Zen among others. A big misconception is that Buddha is a God , he is not, we bow in respect to the Buddha , not in worship. For some it is just a "way of life" for others it is a religion. Buddhists do not believe in Heaven or Hell or God for that matter. We believe in the cycles of birth and death until one becomes "enlightened" and is no longer reborn. You just cease to "be". This is Nirvana. We learn that people fear death because of Ego and attachments to material and sensual things. When you learn to let go of attachments and practice compassion for all sentient beings, you move toward "enlightenment". That is but a very small description of one sect of Buddhism, but it changes depending on the sect. For more info you can check out buddhanet or e-sangha.<br>  <br>  Lindy... I have read your other answers to questions. You are apparently a Christian yet you sow seeds of religious intolerance yourself. You create your own suffering in your intolerance, bitterness and hatred. I pity you.Life itself is suffering because of it's impermanent nature. Nothing is permanent, neither happiness nor sadness. You don't have to live a terrible life to suffer. Even the rich are subject to old age , sickness and death, no one can escape. Learning to live life in the present and realize every precious moment is enlightenement.|`|AA10229890	You mean Buddhism?<br>  <br>  There are different sects of Buddhism, much like in Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Paganism.<br>  <br>  Buddhism encourages people to be calm, enlightened pacifists.<br>  <br>  Why not read about it on Wikipedia?<br>  <br>  - 16 yo Pagan|`|4662c4b152c0b963c1f3f7572dab61e6aa	Buddhist is not a religion, but rather Buddhism is a "religion".

There is no God, nor is Buddha related to a God.  <br>  Really in very simple terms you could say that:<br>  1.  You shoud seek to become a Buddha or elightened<br>  2.  Study the law or natural law - also study yourself - meditate look within.<br>  3.  Join with a community that is also seeking to become elightened.  <br>  <br>  Nothing about a  God or some belief in the afterlife.  Just how to make your current life better.<br>  <br>  Much of the other stuff was added by the surrounding culture at that time.|`|df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	Well, it is a religion with moral values like the Abrahamic religions, but leaves God the "right to exist" but does not address His existence, and also leaves the afterlife ambiguous.|`|89a5f1eb70d8875230a22ae499a8e291aa	I was raised Buddhist, as a matter of fact.  Let me see what I can do.  First, let me recommend a book by a scholar (not a Buddhist himself).  It really explains Buddhism well.<br>  <br>  _Buddhism: Its Essence and Development_  by Edward Conze<br>  <br>  Buddhism is perhaps both the most complicated religion and the simplest in the world.  It's complicated until you really get deep into the practice of it, and then all the complexity falls away and you realize that it's simple.  But, then, it's a life long persuit.  Much of Buddhist scripture was written with the idea that people would spend their whole lives contemplating it, rather than that it be easy to understand.  The Buddha himself, after he became enlightened (at least according to legend), spent several years in which he had trouble explaining what he had come to understand to others.<br>  <br>  Here are some Buddhist ideas to start you out with.  All of us are to some extent ignorant about the truth and in a state of delusion.  Our souls are clouded by our upbringing (particularly for those of us who were raised by abusive parents or who came from dysfunctional families), by our emotions, by our perceptions, by what we've learned and what we have not.  Because of this, we often create our own suffering.  We act on assumptions from a clouded and mirky soul and often lash out at others because we think that we're right and they're wrong.  But, our actions have natural consequences.  When we lash out at others, we may fail to see that we're the ones who are wrong.  Or, we may fail to see, when they hurt us, that they thought THEY were right and WE were wrong.  Regardless of who's right and who's wrong, lashing out with anger and hatred at another only makes things worse.  So, we must clear our souls of all of this garbage and we must do so continually, because garbage keeps collecting.  This can be done through practices, like meditation or contemplating riddles that have no answer.  Our minds and souls can ultimately become still and in that stillness we can perceive things much more clearly.  Finally, we can come to have compassion for the suffering of others, because we realize that they're at least as ignorant and dillusional as we are.  Ultimately, it is the hope of Buddhism that humans can stop fighting one another over arrogance, greed, anger and hatred, and join together in a great community through understanding and compassion.<br>  <br>  The Buddha said that each one of us is under three basic dillusions.  First, we think that things either are or are not.  The truth, he said, is that things are always changing.  Consider our lives.  We think that we came to be when we were born and cease to be when we die.  The truth is that we were other things (like our dad's sperm and our mother's egg) before we were us.  When we die, we will be a decomposing body, but perhaps a plant or tree will grow up on the soil we fertilize.  Perhaps a bird will live in that tree.  Perhaps another human being will prosper from the wood of the tree or from the bird.  So, the cycle of life continues.  Matter is preserved.  We only really keep changing - constantly changing.<br>  <br>  The second dillusion is that we think there is such a thing as "self" and "ownership".  We think the names we were given mean something.  But, they only mean something to our society.  In reality, we are each nothing more than subsets of the universe.  We think we own things, but it's only because members of society agree on ownership.  But, really we own nothing because ownership has no universal meaning.  So, we are nothing more than subsets of the universe.<br>  <br>  Third, we think that it's possible to live lives of pleasure without suffering.  The truth is that all life is suffering.  First of all, all life CONTAINS suffering, but it also contains pleasure.  But, we're always trying to avoid suffering and only ever have pleasure.  We create more suffering for ourselves in this way.  We might make lots of money only to find that our relationships go rotten, or what have you.  There are countless ways in which striving to only ever have pleasure and be devoid of suffering only create more suffering.  All pleasure must come to an end (but so must all suffering!).  Therefore, whenever we have pleasure, we're somewhat fearful that the pleasure will end.  So, really, if we stay in this dillusion, we'll suffer every moment of our lives: either suffering for real, being afraid of suffering or wondering when our pleasure will end.<br>  <br>  That's the bad news, but there's good news.  That is that we can face reality fearlessly.  We can let go of our egos.  We can stop trying to have pleasure all the time.  We can accept the suffering with the pleasure.  We can let go of our anger, hatred, greed, jealousy and fear.  But, we must not repress our emotions or beat ourselves up over being human.  Instead, we can simply sit and observe ourselves with all of our imperfections.  We can sit down and observe ourselves being angry, hateful or what have you.  We can observe our suffering.  We can be fully present in our pleasure and free ourselves from worry.  We can do this through mystical practices, such as meditation.<br>  <br>  I know that doesn't sound all that great, but try it.  You can't really understand Buddhism without practicing it.  Because, something remarkable happens when we really practice it hard and for a good long time.  There's a happiness that's beyond mundane pleasure and pain.  There's a joy and bliss that comes.  Because, by doing all this work on ourselves to liberate ourselves from our dillusions and having compassion for others, our lives improve.  By letting go, oddly, we gain treasures that we never knew existed, like self-control, loving relationships, community and taking joy in the midst of the craziness of life in things we seldom took joy in before.<br>  <br>  But, the Buddha said we must live in what he called the Middle Way.  A common mistake among new Buddhist students is to give up everything until you're a bum on the street or to give up everything until you're not taking care of your needs.  This ISN'T Buddhism.  True Buddhism means striking a balance between letting go on the one hand and also having what we need (food, shelter, water, etc.) on the other.  If we die, we won't be able to gain wisdom or improve our lives.<br>  <br>  Buddhist ethics can be summarized as follows: (1) take responsibility for your actions, because actions have natural consequences (if you punch someone and they punch back, it's your own darn fault), (2) improve yourself so that you can be the best person you can be, practically and ethically and (3) have compassion for others (we're all in this crazy life together - we're all suffering together).<br>  <br>  Here's a simple form of meditation you might try practicing.  Sit and set a time for a reasonable amount of time, say 10 minutes.  Breath and as you breath be aware of everything you can.  Be aware of your emotions, your thoughts, your perceptions, your bodily sensations, etc.  Just sit with those things and observe them without judgement.  Do this every day.  If you like, you might try expanding the time to 15, 20 or even 30 minutes.  Serious Buddhists will do this for 30-60 minutes on a regular basis.  They'll also often go on retreats in which they do this for days, or even a week or two, stopping only for silent meals, sleep and walking meditation.<br>  <br>  Hope that gives you a sense of Buddhism.  There are a lot of varieties out there.  Many of them have native religion mixed in with them, like the worship of native Deities and the like, but that really came in afterwards.  My religion professor in college defined Buddhism as a religion, because he said that religions are really defined in terms of practice rather than belief, and Buddhism definitely has religious practices and a religious structure.  It's more than just philosophy, because you actually have to do mystical practices to gain its benifit.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|dccca403dfd529e68615b2fcc6c8af11aa	<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/buddhism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/buddhi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fwbo.org/buddhism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fwbo.org/buddhism.html</a><br>  <br>  Just a few sites...Buddhists are very peaceful people.....|`|e82a67f72b7a76a3f597d1f6de63b479aa	Buddhism is a pipe dream. There are no professing buddhists who actually adhere to the buddhist philosophy. Buddhism is all about suffering in this life. The people in this country who "claim" to be buddhists like to make people think that they have attained the "enlightenment" status. Yet none of them can tell you what that is, because none of them have devoted their lives to suffering. (In reality, they know how stupid it is to spend thier whole life in lack and suffering.) Yet they think that tossing the word "enlightenment" around makes them sound smart.<br>  <br>  Here's the kicker - No buddhist ever - not now, not ever, not even Siddhartha Gautama (the original buddha) has ever achieved "nirvana." <br>  <br>  Buddhism - what a waste of time.

If it lacks the "universal" genetic code or is even more alien in having something that does not greatly resemble the DNA/RNA found on Earth, it might suggest independent evolution.  If life is found on Mars, that has a genetic code similar to that on Earth, but unlike anything on Earth, it might suggest cross seeding by meteoric ejecta or even panspermia.<br>  <br>  If life is found on Mars, the various hypotheses (other than Creationism which is untestable) will be tested.|`|51a2b8c54dc670b7e9d6e7e86e590e72aa	it would have nothing to do with either|`|62c9ae4a39d4c1a9a64e53e18a28893baa	OH-OH, I saw that movie. <br>  <br>  Mars Attacks!!!|`|95176bb719c104fed1b17f779276ab1caa	Creationism and there is no life on Mars.|`|df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	Neither, I believe.

The Jews, who rejected Jesus as a Prophet of God, called him an impostor. The Christians on the other hand, consider him to be the son of God and worship him as such. Islam considers Jesus as one of the great Prophets of God and respects him as much as Abraham, Moses and Muhammad. This is in conformity with the Islamic point of view of the oneness of God, the oneness of Divine guidance, and the complimentary role of the subsequent messages of God’s messengers. The essence of Islam, which is the willing submission to the will of God, was revealed to Adam who passed it on to his children. All following revelations to Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and finally Muhammad were in conformity with that message in addition to some elaboration to define the relation between Man and God, man and man, man and his environment, and to live according to God’s instructions. Thus, any contradiction among revealed religions is viewed by Islam as a man-made element introduced into these religions. The position of Jesus in the three major religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam, should not be an exception.<br>  Although the Qur’an does not present a detailed life-account of Jesus, it highlights the important aspects of his birth, his mission, his ascension to heaven and passes judgements on the Christian beliefs concerning him.
AA11040867	Hi JoJo,<br>  <br>  There are many versions of the legend, here is the first and the others can be found on the following web site:<br>  <br>  Version 1.0<br>  <br>  Probably the most well-known version, outlined in The Jersey Devil, goes something like this:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In 1735, a woman named Leeds, who had already had 12 children, gave birth to a 13th. During labor she proclaimed, “May the Devil take this one!”. The baby, upon being born, turned into a monster with the head of a collie, the wings of a bat and cloven feet. It promptly flew out the window and has been haunting the Pine Barrens ever since, mutilating animals, scaring the locals and bringing bad luck.<br>  <br>  Just goes to show we should be careful what we wish for?!!|`|a5f1b4c7bbfaf30ae1bb896d87cdb66caa	The following was copied directly from my source site.  MUCH more information can be found at that site.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  The story begins in 1735 when a Mrs. Leeds of Smithville was pregnant. This was to be her thirteenth child, and Mrs. Leeds was feeling old before her time. As her labor began one stormy night, she cursed the unborn baby during a fit of painful contractions, saying, "Let this child be a devil!" Mrs. Leeds soon forgot her curse when a beautiful baby boy was placed in her arms by the midwife. Suddenly the baby's body started to mutate, and Mrs. Leeds watched in horror as the baby's face elongated to resemble a bat or horse, and long, dark wings sprouted from his shoulderblades. His legs grew long and thin and his pudgy feet hardened and formed into hoof-like extremities. Fear gripped all in the room as long claws grew from the baby's fingertips and his blue eyes yellowed. The creature before them now showed no resemblance to the baby it had been just moments before its transformation. The beast let out an ear piercing scream and then turned, burst through the roof of the cabin and flew off into the night.<br>  <br>  There are also several variations on the events of the Jersey Devil's birth. Some say that the creature was born as a devil and never resembled a human. Other variations also say that before the Jersey Devil flew off into the Pine Barrens, it killed and ate all people present in the cabin. It has also been said that (assuming it did not kill all in the room) the Jersey Devil would return to its home for years and sit perched on a fence. After a while, Mrs. Leeds/Shourds, not knowing what to do with her deformed child, "shooed" it away, and it never returned.|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	I have a book at home called North American Monsters or something like that and it has a section on the Jersey Devil, which I flipped past but didn't read in detail.  But it has a picture and he's an ugly little sucker about 3 1/2 feet tall, with wings and a goofy horsey head.<br>  <br>  Now, on the X-Files, the Jersey Devil was just a feral human with no outrageous characteristics.  Basically, everybody was just surprised that a wild humanoid was living in the woods in New Jersey.
AA12328811	I am sure your prayer was heard. Sometimes we will find that our prayers won't change someone, as they have free will. But we can pray that their heart be changed. The Bible also says that some are witnessed to by our actions. <br>  I don't understand violence in relationships. It makes me sad that one can do this to another that is a part of them.  But if he gets violent, you may need to get protection from the police. We do in the natural what we can, and the Lord does what He wills in the spiritual realm.

If your husband gave you a bloody nose and bruising, that is abuse, Honey, take care of yourself. No woman deserves this treatment. My husband left me, with three 3 kids and all I had was a part time job. I was so depressed. But as time went on I liked having my kids to myself and without the terror of having this man in the house. He slapped my ears so hard I'm surprised I am not deaf. He left me for another woman. Trust me, life does go on. I have since remarried and have a wonderful husband. God Bless, stay close to Jesus. That is what got me through.

Revelations talks about the time of the end and of the settling up of gods kingodm. many organized religons have debated what the 1440.000 standing before chirist means, and who the unnumbered people standing before christ who have been washed in the blood of chirst are.<br>  why has this debate being going on for years, because the orgianal hebrew and greek text was written without punucation. and where we put the commas, etc can and does change the meaning of the text. for example when jesus was on the stake, ( cross ) he said to his companion beside him " truly i say to you today you will be with me in paradise"  if you say Truly i say to you today, you will be with me in paridise, it refers to a future date. If you say "Truly i say to you, today you will be with me in paridise." it means right now , that is why men still claim to day to have a better understanding a new interperation of the bible. and the debate of what parts are literal, which parts are metaphocial goes on today and will continue to do so.|`|0deb7a8ff50b924bf5e675c3e6489f62aa	ther is an argument to say the bible is no longer relivant and is a book for its own time.but lets face it we all need  moral direction.<br>  of course you pastor or minister can no decide how the bible will be used or abused.|`|97af8cc2d78866a07101b7bdfe3cb105aa	You do.

He then went flying down my street, which there is a dip at one end and he hit it at about 90 miles an hour and lost control of his vehicle. He kept going down my street until the dead end. There is a huge mound of dirt, kinda like a big dirt bike jump, he hit that at like 40-50 miles an hour and flipped his truck over and crushed him, killin himself. Another one was when i was 12, i was in my garage (same place) fixing my bike, and this guy in a ford probe was running from the cops, still dont know why, and he also hit the dip at like 90 miles an hour, broke his steering column and lost control of his vehicle totally. He then continued down the road and came up on the sidewalk, where i was standing because i was looking to see what was going on, he nearly hit me, then he took out the mail box an ran into our retaining wall with his car. No one was hurt, but it scared the hell outta me. He was arrested for evading police and possesion of drug pariphenelia (however you spell it) and he went to prison for 2 years. Funny now...but i could have been killed.

Ya lo podrás comprobar por tí mismo. Yo aprendí a hablar así, pero después fui a un cursito en una academia para que me den el certificado (para el currículum). Me anoté en el último nivel. Saqué 100% en el oral. (en el escrito tuve algunos errores de gramática).|`|d7c9d19d62f38ae344f8e0064e3f48c9aa	La mejor forma es estar donde hablan solo imngles y tener necesidad de comunicarte yo asi lo aprendi super rapido...|`|f0d40512cf4566abf1a2b7d8c38b1064aa	Leyendo libros, viendo peliculas y escuchando canciones en ingles. tambien ir a un pais en que se hable ingles, o hablar en ingles con alguien q conozcas|`|a9a24b00c1481da3126e61d4fd2b9c4aaa	Sin duda alguna.... teniendo una pareja de habla inglesa.

No His hands were nailed onto the cross and He did not fall off. The Roman soldiers seen to that. It is hard to believe that a loving God would do such a thing for the human race, just so you could be with Him in Paradise when you die. A sense of humour is a wonderful thing learn to use it wisely young man.|`|AA12363172	No, he was crucified, not hung...|`|df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	After almost everyone He loved left Him and He was accused of all sorts of horrible things with stories that didn't coincide, He was beaten and scourged and forced to carry a huge beam until He couldn't.  He made His way to the place of execution of criminals.  He was stripped naked, had His wrists and feet nailed to a cross made of wood, that was then slid into a fairly deep hole, which pulls the shoulders out of socket.  He may have been tied to the cross also.  His position made it so that in order to breath He had to "stand up" on the nail through His feet.  He eventually died of asphyxiation and had His heart pierced by the spear of a Roman soldier Captain.<br>  <br>  I also forgot to mention how he was questioned twice and no charges stuck and a murder was released so that He could be charged.  Then the crowds cheered for Him to be crucified and when it was determined He be executed (like a criminal).  They also mocked Him with a crown of thorns and a robe and stuck nasty wine in His mouth.
AA11455037	well the old testiment was already fullfilled when christ died on the cross.We are living in the day of Grace,we no longer have to slay a sheep to cover our sins.When christ died upon the cross he made the devine sacrifice,and his blood now covers our sins...Yes I take the Bible litererly, It is the inspired word of God,we do not need to live under the Law(old testiment now)that does not mean that the old testiment was wrong ,it only means that it was their law in the old times before Christ died for our sins I believe people do not see the Bible all alike is because the Bible   only comes to life for those who understand it....In order to understand everything in the Bible it has to be revealed to you through prayer.and the Holy spirit.........i do hope this helps in some way..God Bless!.|`|60e5cb843bb6487d500ee715c0a8a09caa	Because it equips us to do good works and because God knows what is in our heart...so it is wise to take it seriously.|`|477268d4c40a7eadac6b07c3cec8fe5eaa	I believe it because I am convicted by the Holy Spirit to its validity.

Many Christians can't see the forest, because of the tree, so to speak.  They fail to understand that the Bible is a story of how God brings about morality and how God thinks.  And a demonstration of His love and charity.  It must be read in context of this understanding and things not pulled from it, as you will, to prove you point.  Rather, understand God, and seek the truth without predjudice.|`|210b6770adc71fc133cf30b7b3bf34dbaa	You do not know what you are talking about. You just want to argue.

d2a383c39b3b208bfabae696fef5a7e7aa	the answer to your question can be found here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.outreachjudaism.org/jeremiah31.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.outreachjudaism.org/jeremiah3...</a><br>  <br>  The reason Jews always win these arguments is because we actually read the whole bible, instead of just the parts we like.<br>  <br>  They say, "If a man divorces his wife, and she goes from him and becomes another man's, may he return to her again?"  Would not that land be greatly polluted?  But you have played the harlot with many lovers; "Yet return to Me," says the Lord.    (Jeremiah 3:1)<br>  <br>  The central feature of the prophet's exhortation that you overlooked appears at the very end of the verse, " 'Yet return to Me', says the Lord."  Jeremiah makes this plea five times throughout the chapter.  The message of the prophet is clear: The mercy and compassion of the Almighty is far beyond the scope of man's comprehension.  Whereas normally the betrayed husband would never take back his adulterous wife, our merciful God will forgive His wayward nation.  While the transgressed husband would never part with his burning wrath against his estranged wife, Jeremiah points the way to forgiveness, reconciliation, and salvation with the Almighty.  In contrast to the enraged husband who would never take back his unfaithful wife, God will, upon repentance, compassionately receive his disobedient people.  What must Israel do to win the affection of its Maker?<br>  <br>  Just cry out to Me, "My Father, you are the Master of my youth!" (Jeremiah 3:4)<br>  <br>  Yet how can this be?  Will God's wrath not be kindled forever against His nation?  Jeremiah responds with a rhetorical question.<br>  <br>  Will He remain angry forever?  Will He keep it to eternity? (Jeremiah 3:5)<br>  <br>  The Almighty's answer follows with a comforting oath promising Israel an eternal destiny and permanent union with the Almighty.<br>  <br>  "Return, O backsliding children," says the Lord, "for I am married to you.  I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion." (Jeremiah 3:14)|`|5a8afc0154c33bfb5ffc8b37e07733eeaa	God is forever married to the Backslider ,Grace How sweet it is|`|04cdd36e5253bbeacbbe475d391ffa25aa	Isaiah 50:1  Thus says the LORD, "Where is the certificate of divorce, By which I have sent your mother away?

Will the gift giver ever discover that you have passed along their gift? If not, go ahead and re-gift. While you must always re-gift with care, there are times when the person to whom you are re-gifting will get a lot of enjoyment out of something that doesn't necessarily suit your personal tastes. In such an instance, re-gifting makes great sense.<br>  <br>  Should I admit to my gift recipient that I'm re-gifting?<br>  <br>  Sometimes this may be appropriate. For example, you may be re-gifting an expensive item. If you don't admit that it is a re-gift, the recipient may feel compelled to reciprocate with an equally expensive item.<br>  <br>  How can I re-package a gift?<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't re-package your item so that it appears to be from another retailer. Imagine the embarrassment if someone tried to return your re-gift! Do make sure you have fun with the presentation! Select beautiful wrapping paper and a gorgeous piece of ribbon just as you would for any other occasion.<br>  <br>  What is a white elephant party?<br>  <br>  A white elephant party is when people gather together for the express purpose of exchanging essentially impractical or humorous items-many of them re-gifted. This is a great way to re-gift without guilt or remorse. Just be sure, that the original gift giver will not be in attendance if their former gift is a designated white elephant.<br>  <br>  Are there other occasions where re-gifting makes sense?<br>  <br>  Absolutely! Consider a couple with a large family who is celebrating the arrival of a new baby. They may receive baby equipment or clothing that they already own. In such an event, it might make sense for them to pass along these duplicate gifts to an individual in need.<br>  <br>  What the most important rule when it comes to re-gifting?<br>  <br>  Other than not hurting the feelings of the original gift giver, the most important thing is to be sure that the re-gift is suitable for the new recipient. Are you merely burdening someone with an unwanted item, or presenting someone with something they are likely to enjoy?|`|4ae127a00c094150ae246593c25916e4aa	I wouldn't return a gift to the sender -- if they give you a gift receipt, then by all means return it.  <br>  <br>  I think re-gifting is acceptable if you gift it to someone that is completely out of the circle of the person that originally gave you the gift.  (Still in the original packaging, etc.!)<br>  <br>  For ex. You can re-gift something from your Aunt in Idaho to a co-worker in connecticut.  <br>  <br>  You shouldn't re-gift something from your Aunt to your cousin...|`|55e973d96fdd133503d044e3244af1c0aa	It is generally not polite to return a gift to a sender, unless the gift was entirely inappropriate.

Pablo dice a Tito: "El motivo de haberte dejado en Creta, fue para que acabaras de organizar lo que faltaba y establecieras presbíteros en cada ciudad, como yo te ordené" (Tt 1, 5). <br>  El episcopado "si alguno aspira al cargo de obispo, desea una noble función" (1 Tm 3, 1) <br>  Timoteo es pastor por imposición de las manos.  2 Tm 1, 6: San Pablo dice a su discípulo Timoteo: "Te recomiendo que reavives el carisma de Dios que está en ti por la imposición de mis manos" <br>  Puntos principales: <br>  <br>  El sacerdocio es un sacramento de la Nueva Alianza, instituido por Cristo en la Ultima Cena, que confiere a un hombre el poder de consagrar y ofrecer el Cuerpo y la Sangre de Cristo en la Santa Misa y de remitir y retener los pecados en el sacramento de reconciliación. <br>  La Iglesia entera es un pueblo sacerdotal. <br>  "La Iglesia entera es un pueblo sacerdotal. Por el bautismo, todos los fieles participan del sacerdocio de Cristo. Esta participación se llama "sacerdocio común de los fieles". A partir de este sacerdocio y al servicio del mismo existe otra participación en la misión de Cristo: la del ministerio conferido por el sacramento del Orden, cuya tarea es servir en nombre y en representación de Cristo-Cabeza en medio de la comunidad". Catecismo Iglesia Católica 1591. <br>  El sacerdocio ministerial difiere esencialmente del sacerdocio común de los fieles.   "El sacerdocio ministerial difiere esencialmente del sacerdocio común de los fieles porque confiere un poder sagrado para el servicio de los fieles. Los ministros ordenados ejercen su servicio en el pueblo de Dios mediante la ense?anza (munus docendi), el culto divino (munus liturgicum) y por el gobierno pastoral (munus regendi)."  (CIC 1592) <br>  Tres grados del sacerdocio.<br>  Desde los orígenes, el ministerio ordenado fue conferido y ejercido en tres grados: el de los obispos, el de los presbíteros y el de los diáconos. Normalmente el sacerdocio se refiere a los presbíteros. <br>  El obispo recibe la plenitud del sacramento del Orden <br>  Lo incorpora a la jerarquía la cual forma un Colegio episcopal y hace de él la cabeza visible de la Iglesia particular que le es confiada. Los obispos, en cuanto sucesores de los apóstoles y miembros del Colegio, participan en la responsabilidad apostólica y en la misión de toda la Iglesia bajo la autoridad del Papa, sucesor de san Pedro. (CIC 1594) <br>  Los presbíteros (sacerdotes)<br>  Los presbíteros están unidos a los obispos en la dignidad sacerdotal y al mismo tiempo dependen de ellos en el ejercicio de sus funciones pastorales; son llamados a ser cooperadores diligentes de los obispos; forman en torno a su obispo el presbiterio que asume con él la responsabilidad de la Iglesia particular. Reciben del obispo el cuidado de una comunidad parroquial o de una función eclesial determinada. (CIC 1595) Sacerdocio >>> <br>  Los diáconos<br>  Son ministros ordenados para las tareas de servicio de la Iglesia; no reciben el sacerdocio ministerial, pero la ordenación les confiere funciones importantes en el ministerio de la palabra, del culto divino, del gobierno pastoral y del servicio de la caridad, tareas que deben cumplir bajo la autoridad pastoral de su obispo. (CIC 1596) <br>  Como se confiere el sacramento<br>  El sacramento del Orden es conferido por la imposición de las manos seguida de una oración consecratoria solemne que pide a Dios para el ordenando las gracias del Espíritu Santo requeridas para su ministerio. La ordenación imprime un carácter sacramental indeleble. (CIC 1597) <br>  Los ministerios conferidos por la ordenación son insustituibles para la estructura orgánica de la Iglesia: sin el obispo, los presbíteros y los diáconos no se puede hablar de Iglesia.(CIC 1593) <br>  Candidatos al sacramento del Orden<br>  La Iglesia confiere el sacramento del Orden únicamente a varones (viri) bautizados, cuyas aptitudes para el ejercicio del ministerio han sido debidamente reconocidas. A la autoridad de la Iglesia corresponde la responsabilidad y el derecho de llamar a uno a recibir la ordenación.  En la Iglesia latina, el sacramento del Orden para el presbiterado sólo es conferido ordinariamente a candidatos que están dispuestos a abrazar libremente el celibato y que manifiestan públicamente su voluntad de guardarlo por amor del Reino de Dios y el servicio de los hombres.  (CIC 1598- 1599) <br>  Quien confiere el sacramento del Orden:  Corresponde a los obispos conferir el sacramento del Orden en los tres grados. (CIC 1600). <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Sobre el Sacerdote y Su Misión:<br>  Su Santidad, Juan Pablo II, <br>  <br>  El sacerdote debe presentarse, ante todo, como un <,,hombre de fe>,, porque él, en virtud de su misión, debe comunicarla a través del anuncio de la Palabra. No podrá predicar el Evangelio de forma convincente si él mismo no ha asimilado profundamente su mensaje. El da testimonio de la fe con su forma de actuar y con toda su vida. Hombre de fe, el sacerdote es también ?hombre de lo sagrado?, testigo del Invisible, portavoz de Dios revelado en Jesucristo. El sacerdote debe ser reconocido como un hombre de Dios, un hombre de oración, al que se ve rezar, al que se oye rezar. El sacerdote, por tanto, debe alimentar en sí mismo una vida espiritual de calidad, inspirada en el don del propio sacerdocio ministerial. Su oración, su forma de compartir, sus esfuerzos en la vida, están inspirados por su actividad apostólica que se alimenta de toda una vida vivida con Dios. Hombre de fe, hombre de lo sagrado, el sacerdote es también un ?hombre de comunión,>. Es él quien reúne al Pueblo de Dios y refuerza la unión que hay entre sus miembros por medio de la Eucaristía; él es el animador de la caridad fraterna entre todos. Actúa con sus hermanos en el sacerdocio. Colabora con su propio obispo. Se esfuerza en acrecentar los lazos de unión entre los miembros del presbiterio. Sobre esta base de relaciones tan ricas y tan profundas, el celibato adquiere un significado nuevo: no es ya una condición del sacerdocio, sino el camino de una verdadera fecundidad, de una auténtica paternidad espiritual, porque el sacerdote entrega su vida para que los frutos del Espíritu maduren en el Pueblo de Dios. ?Ven y sígueme?, sé mi testigo, da todo tu amor a Dios y a tus hermanos, y estarás al servicio del Pueblo de Dios. <br>  <br>  REFLEXIONES<br>  <br>  Los hombres desean contemplar en el sacerdote el rostro de Cristo, encontrar en él a la persona que, ?puesta en favor de los hombres en lo que se refiere a Dios? (Hebreos 5, 1), pueda decir con san Agustín: ?Nuestra ciencia es Cristo y nuestra esperanza también es Cristo. Es él quien infunde en nosotros la fe con respecto a las realidades temporales y es él quien nos revela esas verdades que se refieren a las realidades eternas? (san Agustín, ?De Trinitate?, 13, 19, 24). -Cardenal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, prefecto de la Congregación para el Clero, 6-2004.<br>  <br>  Como centinelas de la Casa de Dios que es la Iglesia, velemos para que en toda la vida eclesial de nuestras parroquias se reviva el encuentro con Cristo crucificado y resucitado. Evitemos los escollos del activismo en los que han naufragado en ocasiones los mejores programas apostólicos y pastorales, y por los que se han hecho áridas muchas vidas comprometidas en un servicio que no ha sido adecuadamente regado por la Palabra de Dios y por su presencia en la Eucaristía. -Cardenal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, prefecto de la Congregación para el Clero, 6-2004.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  ARTíCULO 4<br>  EL SACRAMENTO DE LA PENITENCIA Y DE LA RECONCILIACIóN <br>  <br>  1422 "Los que se acercan al sacramento de la penitencia obtienen de la misericordia de Dios el perdón de los pecados cometidos contra El y, al mismo tiempo, se reconcilian con la Iglesia, a la que ofendieron con sus pecados. Ella les mueve a conversión con su amor, su ejemplo y sus oraciones" (LG 11). <br>  <br>  I El nombre de este sacramento  <br>  <br>  1423 Se le denomina sacramento de conversión porque realiza sacramentalmente la llamada de Jesús a la conversión (cf Mc 1,15), la vuelta al Padre (cf Lc 15,18) del que el hombre se había alejado por el pecado. <br>  <br>  Se denomina sacramento de la Penitencia porque consagra un proceso personal y eclesial de  conversión, de arrepentimiento y de reparación por parte del cristiano pecador. <br>  <br>  1424 Es llamado sacramento de la confesión porque la declaración o manifestación, la confesión de los pecados ante el sacerdote, es un elemento esencial de este sacramento. En un sentido profundo este sacramento es también una "confesión", reconocimiento y alabanza de la santidad de Dios y de su misericordia para con el hombre pecador. <br>  <br>  Se le llama sacramento del perdón porque, por la absolución sacramental del sacerdote, Dios concede al penitente "el perdón y la paz" (OP, fórmula de la absolución). <br>  <br>  Se le denomina sacramento de reconciliación porque otorga al pecador el amor de Dios que reconcilia: "Dejaos reconciliar con Dios" (2 Co 5,20). El que vive del amor misericordioso de Dios está pronto a responder a la llamada del Se?or: "Ve primero a reconciliarte con tu hermano" (Mt 5,24). <br>  <br>  II Por qué un sacramento de la reconciliación después del bautismo <br>  <br>  1425 "Habéis sido lavados, habéis sido santificados, habéis sido justificados en el nombre del Se?or Jesucristo y por el Espíritu de nuestro Dios" (1 Co 6,11). Es preciso darse cuenta de la grandeza del don de Dios que se nos hace en los sacramentos de la iniciación cristiana para comprender hasta qué punto el pecado es algo que no cabe en aquél que "se ha revestido de Cristo" (Ga 3,27). Pero el apóstol S. Juan dice también: "Si decimos: `no tenemos pecado', nos enga?amos y la verdad no está en nosotros" (1 Jn 1,8). Y el Se?or mismo nos ense?ó a orar: "Perdona nuestras ofensas" (Lc 11,4) uniendo el perdón mutuo de nuestras ofensas al perdón que Dios concederá a nuestros pecados. <br>  <br>  1426 La conversión a Cristo, el nuevo nacimiento por el Bautismo, el don del Espíritu Santo, el Cuerpo y la Sangre de Cristo recibidos como alimento nos han hecho "santos e inmaculados ante él" (Ef 1,4), como la Iglesia misma, esposa de Cristo, es "santa e inmaculada ante él" (Ef 5,27). Sin embargo, la vida nueva recibida en la iniciación cristiana no suprimió la fragilidad y la debilidad de la naturaleza humana, ni la inclinación al pecado que la tradición llama concupiscencia, y que permanece en los bautizados a fin de que sirva de prueba en ellos en el combate de la vida cristiana ayudados por la gracia de Dios (cf DS 1515). Esta lucha es la de la conversión con miras a la santidad y la vida eterna a la que el Se?or no cesa de llamarnos (cf DS 1545; LG 40).<br>  <br>  III La conversión de los bautizados <br>  <br>  1427 Jesús llama a la conversión. Esta llamada es una parte esencial del anuncio del Reino: "El tiempo se ha cumplido y el Reino de Dios está cerca; convertíos y creed en la Buena Nueva" (Mc 1,15). En la predicación de la Iglesia, esta llamada se dirige primeramente a los que no conocen todavía a Cristo y su Evangelio. Así, el Bautismo es el lugar principal de la conversión primera y fundamental. Por la fe en la Buena Nueva y por el Bautismo (cf. Hch 2,38) se renuncia al mal y se alcanza la salvación, es decir, la remisión de todos los pecados y el don de la vida nueva. <br>  <br>  1428 Ahora bien, la llamada de Cristo a la conversión sigue resonando en la vida de los cristianos. Esta segunda conversión es una tarea ininterrumpida para toda la Iglesia que "recibe en su propio seno a los pecadores" y que siendo "santa al mismo tiempo que necesitada de purificación constante,busca sin cesar la penitencia y la renovación" (LG 8). Este esfuerzo de conversión no es sólo una obra humana. Es el movimiento del "corazón contrito" (Sal 51,19), atraído y movido por la gracia (cf Jn 6,44; 12,32) a responder al amor misericordioso de Dios que nos ha amado primero (cf 1 Jn 4,10). <br>  <br>  1429 De ello da testimonio la conversión de S. Pedro tras la triple negación de su Maestro. La mirada de infinita misericordia de Jesús provoca las lágrimas del arrepentimiento (Lc 22,61) y, tras la resurrección del Se?or, la triple afirmación de su amor hacia él (cf Jn 21,15-17). La segunda conversión tiene también una dimensión comunitaria. Esto aparece en la llamada del Se?or a toda la Iglesia: "?Arrepiéntete!" (Ap 2,5.16). <br>  <br>  S. Ambrosio dice acerca de las dos conversiones que, en la Iglesia, "existen el agua y las lágrimas: el agua del Bautismo y las lágrimas de la Penitencia" (Ep. 41,12). <br>  <br>  IV La penitencia interior <br>  <br>  1430 Como ya en los profetas, la llamada de Jesús a la conversión y a la penitencia no mira, en primer lugar, a las obras exteriores "el saco y la ceniza", los ayunos y las mortificaciones, sino a la conversión del corazón, la penitencia interior. Sin ella, las obras de penitencia permanecen estériles y enga?osas; por el contrario, la conversión interior impulsa a la expresión de esta actitud por medio de signos visibles, gestos y obras de penitencia (cf Jl 2,12-13; Is 1,16-17; Mt 6,1-6. 16-18). <br>  <br>  1431 La penitencia interior es una reorientación radical de toda la vida, un retorno, una conversión a Dios con todo nuestro corazón, una ruptura con el pecado, una aversión del mal, con repugnancia hacia las malas acciones que hemos cometido. Al mismo tiempo, comprende el deseo y la resolución de cambiar de vida con la esperanza de la misericordia divina y la confianza en la ayuda de su gracia. Esta conversión del corazón va acompa?ada de dolor y tristeza saludables que los Padres llamaron "animi cruciatus" (aflicción del espíritu), "compunctio cordis" (arrepentimiento del corazón) (cf Cc. de Trento: DS 1676-1678; 1705; Catech. R. 2, 5, 4). <br>  <br>  1432 El corazón del hombre es rudo y endurecido. Es preciso que Dios dé al hombre un corazón nuevo (cf Ez 36,26-27). La conversión es primeramente una obra de la gracia de Dios que hace volver a él nuestros corazones: "Conviértenos, Se?or, y nos convertiremos" (Lc 5,21). Dios es quien nos da la fuerza para comenzar de nuevo. Al descubrir la grandeza del amor de Dios, nuestro corazón se estremece ante el horror y el peso del pecado y comienza a temer ofender a Dios por el pecado y verse separado de él. El corazón humano se convierte mirando al que nuestros pecados traspasaron (cf Jn 19,37; Za 12,10). <br>  <br>  Tengamos los ojos fijos en la sangre de Cristo y comprendamos cuán preciosa es a su Padre, porque, habiendo sido derramada para nuestra salvación, ha conseguido para el mundo entero la gracia del arrepentimiento (S. Clem. Rom. Cor 7,4). <br>  <br>  1433 Después de Pascua, el Espíritu Santo "convence al mundo en lo referente al pecado" (Jn 16, 8-9), a saber, que el mundo no ha creído en el que el Padre ha enviado. Pero este mismo Espíritu, que desvela el pecado, es el Consolador (cf Jn 15,26) que da al corazón del hombre la gracia del arrepentimiento y de la conversión (cf Hch 2,36-38; Juan Pablo II, DeV 27-48). <br>  <br>  V Diversas formas de penitencia en la vida cristiana <br>  <br>  1434 La penitencia interior del cristiano puede tener expresiones muy variadas. La Escritura y los Padres insisten sobre todo en tres formas: el ayuno, la oración, la limosna (cf. Tb 12,8; Mt 6,1-18), que expresan la conversión con relación a sí mismo, con relación a Dios y con relación a los demás. Junto a la purificación radical operada por el Bautismo o por el martirio, citan, como medio de obtener el perdón de los pecados, los esfuerzos realizados para reconciliarse con el prójimo, las lágrimas de penitencia, la preocupación por la salvación del prójimo (cf St 5,20), la intercesión de los santos y la práctica de la caridad "que cubre multitud de pecados" (1 P 4,8). <br>  <br>  1435 La conversión se realiza en la vida cotidiana mediante gestos de reconciliación, la atención a los pobres, el ejercicio y la defensa de la justicia y del derecho (Am 5,24; Is 1,17), por el reconocimiento de nuestras faltas ante los hermanos, la corrección fraterna, la revisión de vida, el examen de conciencia, la dirección espiritual, la aceptación de los sufrimientos, el padecer la persecución a causa de la justicia. Tomar la cruz cada día y seguir a Jesús es el camino más seguro de la penitencia (cf Lc 9,23). <br>  <br>  1436 Eucaristía y Penitencia. La conversión y la penitencia diarias encuentran su fuente y su alimento en la Eucaristía, pues en ella se hace presente el sacrificio de Cristo que nos reconcilió con Dios; por ella son alimentados y fortificados los que viven de la vida de Cristo; "es el antídoto que nos libera de nuestras faltas cotidianas y nos preserva de pecados mortales" (Cc. de Trento: DS 1638). <br>  <br>  1437 La lectura de la Sagrada Escritura, la oración de la Liturgia de las Horas y del Padre Nuestro, todo acto sincero de culto o de piedad reaviva en nosotros el espíritu de conversión y de penitencia y contribuye al perdón de nuestros pecados. <br>  <br>  1438 Los tiempos y los días de penitencia a lo largo del a?o litúrgico (el tiempo de Cuaresma, cada viernes en memoria de la muerte del Se?or) son momentos fuertes de la práctica penitencial de la Iglesia (cf SC 109-110; CIC can. 1249-1253; CCEO 880-883). Estos tiempos son particularmente apropiados para los ejercicios espirituales, las liturgias penitenciales, las peregrinaciones como signo de penitencia, las privaciones voluntarias como el ayuno y la limosna, la comunicación cristiana de bienes (obras caritativas y misioneras). <br>  <br>  1439 El proceso de la conversión y de la penitencia fue descrito maravillosamente por Jesús en la parábola llamada "del hijo pródigo", cuyo centro es "el Padre misericordioso" (Lc 15,11-24): la fascinación de una libertad ilusoria, el abandono de la casa paterna; la miseria extrema en que el hijo se encuentra tras haber dilapidado su fortuna; la humillación profunda de verse obligado a apacentar cerdos, y peor aún, la de desear alimentarse de las algarrobas que comían los cerdos; la reflexión sobre los bienes perdidos; el arrepentimiento y la decisión de declararse culpable ante su padre, el camino del retorno; la acogida generosa del padre; la alegría del padre: todos estos son rasgos propios del proceso de conversión. El mejor vestido, el anillo y el banquete de fiesta son símbolos de esta vida nueva, pura, digna, llena de alegría que es la vida del hombre que vuelve a Dios y al seno de su familia, que es la Iglesia.

AA11634352	They follow culture and not religion. IF they followed religion, women would not be oppressed, and those idiots wouldn't be killing themselves and innocent people.  Sadly, they refuse to follow it.  The Prophet (PBUH) served himself, did the housework, and stood up for women.<br>  Here is an article I found that describes how the muslim man SHOULD be.  As you saw with the stupid riots over the cartoons, nothing in this was followed.<br>  <br>  The Mercy of the Prophet (PBUH) with Mankind<br>  <br>  God Almighty says, “And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds.” (Al-Anbiyaa’ 21:107). Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) and his House, is the Prophet of mercy, sent by God as a mercy to all mankind; believers, non-believers, and hypocrites. His mercy sheltered all humanity: men, women and children. Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) was merciful to all creatures including animals and birds. God almighty describes Muhammad’s pity, kindness, and mercy to all the creatures:<br>  <br>  “Certainly a Messenger has come to you from among yourselves; grievous to him is your falling into distress, excessively solicitous respecting you; to the believers (he is) compassionate,” (At-Tawbah 9:128).<br>  <br>  It was even perceived by some that God favored Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) by describing him by two of His names<br>  <br>  It was narrated that a man asked Prophet Muhammad for charity. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) gave it and then asked the man, “Have I dealt with you rightfully?” The man answered, “no, and you have not dealt with me in a beautiful manner either.” The Muslims then got angry and rose up. Then he (the Prophet) waved them to stop. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) went home and sent him something. He then asked him once more, “Are you content?” the man answered, “Yes, I am. May Allah reward you with kindness in your family and kin.” The Prophet then said, “You said what you said and it left something in my companions’ hearts. So, what if you repeat what you have just said now before them, to take away what is in their hearts towards you?” The man agreed. In the evening or the day after, Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) told his companions, “This man showed his dissatisfaction so I increased what I gave him to let him be satisfied.” He turned then to the man and asked him “isn’t that right?” The man answered: “Yes, may God reward you with kindness in family and kin.”<br>  <br>  The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) then commented, “The example of me and this (man) is like that of a man whose camel went astray. People following the camel only increased its unwillingness. The man called to them, ‘leave me and my camel alone. I am more gentle and knowledgeable about it.’ He then turned to the camel, offering it some vegetation from the earth. He then called it back until it came forth, kneeled down, put the saddle on it and rode it away. Had I left you with what the man said you would have killed him and he would go to Hellfire” (Ahmed).<br>  <br>  It was also narrated that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) said, “I do not want any one of you to tell me off about any of my Companions. I want to go out to (meet) you with a free heart.” (Abu Dawud).<br>  <br>  His pity and mercy to his people were manifested in lightening their load, making their obligations easy, in avoiding certain things for fear that they would become obligations upon the people. Among his sayings in this regard is, “was it not for fear of tiring my nation, I would have asked them to use a miswak (tooth stick) with each ablution.” His mercy was reflected in what he said about the Qiyam-Al-Layl (Night Vigil Prayer), meaning that one should not do it all night long; continuous fasting; and his disliking to enter the Ka`bah so that his nation would not become obstinate [about following him in that]. His mercy was also manifested in his prayer that God might turn his cursing of any one of them unto mercy. Whenever he heard a child crying during prayers, he used to shorten the prayer1.<br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad prayed to God, “O Allah! Whoever I insulted or cursed, turn this into charity, mercy, a prayer, cleansing, and an immolation with which you bring him closer to You on Doomsday.” When his people did not believe him, Jibreel (the Archangel) came to him and said, “God Almighty heard the sayings and accusations of your people and He, Almighty, asked the angel of the mountains to obey any order from you against them. The angel of the mountains called Prophet Muhammad and said, “Ask for whatever you want, and I would crush them with the akhshabin (surrounding mountains).” Yet, Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) said, “No, but I hope that Allah will bring out of their offspring people who worship Allah alone with no associates.”<br>  <br>  Ibn Al Monkader narrated that Jibreel told Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house), “God commanded the sky, the earth and the mountains to obey your orders.” The Prophet answered, “I delay my nation and Maybe Allah will induce them to repentance.” A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, “Never was the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) left to make a choice between two matters but he would prefer the easier among them.” Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) told us that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) preferred “positive” preaching to preclude pessimism and boredom<br>  <br>  A’ishah narrated that she once found difficulty in riding a horse, so she kept reining it in repeatedly. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) then said, “You must have gentleness2.”<br>  <br>  Among the examples of his general mercy is his mercy with the hypocrites by saving them from death and captivity for their outward following of Islam in this life.<br>  <br>  From his comprehensive mercy is his mercy with the non-believers by lifting the punishment of annihilation in this world. As for past nations, when Allah, majestic in His praise, sent them a messenger and they disbelieve him, they would be and tortured and annihilated. God almighty tells us how nations of Noah, `Aad, Thamoud, and Lout and others were tortured and how were they rewarded for their mockery.<br>  <br>  As for the infidels among the nation of Muhammad, their general chastisement by annihilation was lifted in honor of this gracious Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) whom Allah, majestic in His praise, has sent as mercy for the worlds.<br>  <br>  The Mercy of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) with Family and Children<br>  <br>  In his Hadith, Imam Moslem narrates that `Amr Ibn Sa`id reported that `Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “I have never met one more merciful with children. He also said, “Ibrahim (the Prophet’s son) was being breastfed by a wet nurse in a village on the outskirts of Madinah. He (the Prophet) used to rush to enter the house with smoke coming out of it (the wet nurse’s husband was a metal smith). The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) would take his grandson, kiss him, and then return him. So when Ibrahim died, the Prophet said, “Ibrahim is my son. He died while still suckling. Verily, he will have two wet nurses to breastfeed him in Paradise.” Meaning they will complete his two-year weaning period, as he died at sixteen or seventeen months of age.” (An-Nawawi)<br>  <br>  His mercy with his family was shown in the way he used to assist them with housework.<br>  <br>  Al-Aswad mentioned that he asked `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) what the Prophet did at home. She answered, “He was humble in the common service of his family. But, when time for prayer came, he used to go and pray.” He (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) was not like tyrannical men. A lot of times, he (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) used to serve himself. It’s mentioned in Ahmad’s Mosnad and others that `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, “The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) used to sew his clothes, mend his sandals, and do what other men do in their homes.”<br>  <br>  His Mercy With Children, Orphans, Widows, and the Sick.<br>  <br>  The two sheikhs (Bukhari and Muslim) narrate on the authority of `Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) said, “I start the prayers, intending to lengthen them. I then hear a child crying so I make them shorter, knowing how emotional a child’s mother gets.”<br>  <br>  An example of his mercy (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) with the children is that he used stroke their heads and kiss them. It was mentioned in the two books of Al-Bukhari and Muslim that `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) kissed Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein (his grandsons) while Al-Aqra’ ibn Hobis Al Tamimi was present. So Al Aqra’ said, “I have ten children. I have never kissed any of them!” Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) looked at him and said, “He who does not have mercy will not have mercy upon him.”<br>  <br>  It is in the two authenticated books that `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, “A nomad once told Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house), “you kiss the children and we never do!” Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) said, “Has Allah withdrawn mercy out of your hearts?” Meaning that he who has mercy in his heart for children drives him to kiss them. And he who gets mercy withdrawn from his heart withholds from kissing them.<br>  <br>  The two sheikhs and At-Tirmidhi narrate that Al-Bara’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “I saw the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) carrying Al-Hassan on his shoulder, saying, “Oh Allah! I love him so love him.”<br>  <br>  At-Tirmidhi narrates that `Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) was asked, “Which member of your family do you love the most?” He said, “Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein.” He used to tell Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her), “Bring me my two sons” and then he would embrace them closely, may Allah be pleased with them.<br>  <br>  Among the examples of his mercy and his love to please children happy that whenever he (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) was given the first of the harvest of fruits, he would give it to give it to the children in his circle. At-Tabrani, said that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) said that the Prophet (peace and blessing be upon him) used to hold the first of any seasonal harvest, he used put it on his eyes then on his lips and say “Oh Allah! Like you have made us see its beginning (of the season), allow us to see its end.” Then he would give it to any child sitting around him3.”<br>  <br>  An example of his mercy was his crying on the passing of his son Ibrahim (may Allah be pleased with him). On the authority of `Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), “The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) entered the room while Ibrahim was dying. Upon that, his eyes started dropping tears. Then `Abdur-Rahman ibn `Awf said, ‘Even you, messenger of Allah!’ Then he said ‘Oh Ibn `Awf! It is but mercy.’ He continued (crying) some more and then said, “The eyes weep, the heart is full of grief, and we are nothing but that which does not please our Lord. Verily, we are sorrowed for your departure O! Ibrahim.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).<br>  <br>  On the authority of Osama Ibn Zaid (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) when the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) was handed his daughter’s son who was dying, his eyes flooded with tears (peace and blessings be upon). Sa`d then told him, “What is this, Prophet of Allah!” He said, “This is a mercy that exalted Allah has made in the hearts of His servants. And surely Allah has mercy to merciful ones among His servants.” (Agreed upon)<br>  <br>  From his mercy is that he (peace and blessing be upon him and his house) never used to disdain from walking along with a widow or with a poor person and fulfill their needs 4. He used to visit weak and sick Muslims and attend their funerals 5. He used to treat orphans well and charitably. He used to commend people to sponsor them and treat them with excellence and he also used to announce the consequent virtues of that saying, “I and a patron of an orphanage are as close in Paradise (while waving with the index and middle finger and parting them 6.” He also said that the best house in Muslim houses is the one with an orphan being treated well in it. 7”<br>  <br>  Of his mercy is when he used to see any of his companions in a state of stress or misfortune, he would feel deep sorrow for that, have pity, and cry, being affected by the circumstances. He went once with `Abdur-Rahman ibn `Awf and others to visit Sa`d Ibn `Obabah. Upon seeing him, he cried and everyone with him then cried 8. He cried and kissed `Othman Ibn Maz`oun after he died. `A’ishah then said that she saw the tears of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) flow on `Othman’s cheeks 9. In another version, it was narrated that The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) kissed `Othman between his eyes and cried for a long time 10.<br>  <br>  His Mercy With Animals<br>  <br>  He (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) used to commend having mercy on animals. He used to forbid his companions from hurting them, tiring them, overburdening them with heavy loads for long periods, torturing them, or pushing them beyond their limits, for that is a form of suffering.<br>  <br>  Once the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) passed by a camel that was so emaciated its back was one with its abdomen. Upon that, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) said, “Fear Allah with regard to livestock. Ride them in a fitting way and eat them when they are in good condition.11”<br>  <br>  He once entered the garden of man from the Ansar (Muslims of Madinah) and there was a camel. When the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) saw the camel it froze and its eyes started watering. Then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) came to it and rubbed its ears so it calmed down. Then the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) said, “Who is the owner of this camel? Whose camel is this?” A young man from the Ansar told him (peace and blessings be upon him and his house),”O Messenger of Allah, it belongs to me.” Then he told him (peace and blessings be upon him and his house), “Do you not fear Allah with regard to this beast which Allah has let you own? It complained to me that you starve it and tire it by overworking it and using it beyond its capacity.12”<br>  <br>  He (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) used to forbid burdening an animal by keeping it standing or sitting on it for a long time unnecessarily. He saw some people sitting on animals so he commented, “Keep them safe and sound when riding them and when leaving them, don’t use them as chairs for your side talks in the streets and markets. A ridden animal might be better than its rider and might remember and mention God more than its rider does.13”<br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) called not to kill even a frog and he said, “Its croaking is tasbeeh (praising God).” 14<br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) once said, “A woman was doomed to enter the Fire because of a cat. She imprisoned it and neither fed it nor set it free to eat the rodents of the earth.” 15<br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad also called for not harassing animals by goading them to hurt or cause harm to each other.<br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad warned against any human being causing a bird to feel panic about its little offspring. Someone took two chicks of a bird (hamra), which came in panic searching for its chicks. Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him and his house) then asked, “Who has distressed it by taking its chicks?” Then he asked them to return the chicks. The Prophet once passed by a burned out anthill. When the Prophet saw it he asked, “Who has burned it?” When he was informed of who had done it, he said, “Only the Lord of Fire has the right to punish with fire.16”<br>  <br>  It was also reported that Prophet Muhammad prohibited the killing of a bird for the sake of pleasure and not for a specific beneficial need, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) said, “Anyone who would kill a bird, this bird would come on Doomsday and say, “God, this person killed me for pleasure and not for benefit. 17”<br>  <br>  It was also reported that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) called for mercy and perfection in slaughter. He saw a person preparing a lamb, laying it down while he was still sharpening his knife. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him and his house) then commented, “Do you want to kill it twice? Sharpen your knife before you lay it down.” 18<br>  <br>  He prohibited taking any animal or any living creature as a target for shooting. 19<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  *Dr. Sayyid Muhammad `Alawi al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on his soul) was a highly respected, eminent scholar in Makkah. He was argued to be the imam of Hadith of his time. He came from one of the most respected families in Makkah which produced great scholars, imams, and preachers.<br>  Book 009, Number 3527: <br>  Fatima bint Qais (Allah be pleased with her) reported: My husband Abu 'Amr b. Hafs b. al-Mughira sent 'Ayyish b. Abu Rabi'a to me with a divorce, and he also sent through him five si's of dates and five si's of barley. I said: Is there no maintenance allowance for me but only this, and I cannot even spend my 'Idda period in your house? He said: No. She said: I dressed myself and came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: How many pronouncements of divorce have been made for you? I said: Three. He said what he ('Ayyish b. Abu Rabi'a) had stated was true. There is no maintenance allowance for you. Spend 'Idda period in the house of your cousin, Ibn Umm Maktum. He is blind and you can put off your garment in his presence. And when you have spent your Idda period, you inform me. She said: Mu'awiya and Abu'l-Jahm (Allah be pleased with them) were among those who had given me the proposal of marriage. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Mu'awiya is destitute and in poor condition and Abu'l-Jahm is very harsh with women (or he beats women, or like that), you should take Usama b. Zaid (as your husband).<br>  <br>  Book 19, Number 3044: <br>  Narrated Al-Irbad ibn Sariyah as-Sulami: <br>  <br>  We alighted with the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) at Khaybar, and he had his companions with him. The chief of Khaybar was a defiant and abominable man. <br>  <br>  He came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and said: Is it proper for you, Muhammad, that you slaughter our donkeys, eat our fruit, and beat our women? <br>  The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) became angry and said: Ibn Awf, ride your horse, and call loudly: Beware, Paradise is lawful only for a believer, and that they (the people) should gather for prayer. <br>  They gathered and the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) led them in prayer, stood up and said: Does any of you, while reclining on his couch, imagine that Allah has prohibited only that which is to be found in this Qur'an? By Allah, I have preached, commanded and prohibited various matters as numerous as that which is found in the Qur'an, or more numerous. Allah has not permitted you to enter the houses of the people of the Book without permission, or beat their women, or eat their fruits when they give you that which is imposed on them. <br>  <br>  Book 11, Number 2138: <br>  Narrated Mu'awiyah ibn Haydah: <br>  <br>  I said: Apostle of Allah, how should we approach our wives and how should we leave them? He replied: Approach your tilth when or how you will, give her (your wife) food when you take food, clothe when you clothe yourself, do not revile her face, and do not beat her. <br>  <br>  Volume 1, Book 9, Number 486: <br>  Narrated 'Aisha: <br>  <br>  Volume 1, Book 9, Number 490: <br>  Narrated 'Aisha: <br>  <br>  The things which annul the prayers were mentioned before me. They said, "Prayer is annulled by a dog, a donkey and a woman (if they pass in front of the praying people)." I said, "You have made us (i.e. women) dogs. I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in my bed between him and the Qibla. Whenever I was in need of something, I would slip away. for I disliked to face him." <br>  <br>  Volume 1, Book 9, Number 498: <br>  Narrated 'Aisha: <br>  <br>  It is not good that you people have made us (women) equal to dogs and donkeys. No doubt I saw Allah's Apostle praying while I used to lie between him and the Qibla and when he wanted to prostrate, he pushed my legs and I withdrew them. <br>  <br>  Volume 1, Book 3, Number 101: <br>  Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: <br>  <br>  Some women requested the Prophet to fix a day for them as the men were taking all his time. On that he promised them one day for religious lessons and commandments. Once during such a lesson the Prophet said, "A woman whose three children die will be shielded by them from the Hell fire." On that a woman asked, "If only two die?" He replied, "Even two (will shield her from the Hell-fire)." <br>  <br>  Volume 4, Book 52, Number 258: <br>  Narrated Ibn 'Umar: <br>  <br>  During some of the Ghazawat of Allah's Apostle a woman was found killed, so Allah's Apostle forbade the killing of women and children. <br>  <br>  Volume 6, Book 60, Number 103: <br>  Narrated Ibn Abbas: <br>  <br>  regarding the Divine Verse: "O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and you should not treat them with harshness that you may take back part of the (Mahr) dower you have given them." (4.19) (Before this revelation) if a man died, his relatives used to have the right to inherit his wife, and one of them could marry her if he would, or they would give her in marriage if they wished, or, if they wished, they would not give her in marriage at all, and they would be more entitled to dispose her, than her own relatives. So the above Verse was revealed in this connection. <br>  <br>  Volume 2, Book 15, Number 103: <br>  Narrated 'Urwa on the authority of 'Aisha: <br>  <br>  On the days of Mina, (11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah) Abu Bakr came to her while two young girls were beating the tambourine and the Prophet was lying covered with his clothes. Abu Bakr scolded them and the Prophet uncovered his face and said to Abu Bakr, "Leave them, for these days are the days of 'Id and the days of Mina." 'Aisha further said, "Once the Prophet was screening me and I was watching the display of black slaves in the Mosque and ('Umar) scolded them. The Prophet said, 'Leave them. O Bani Arfida! (carry on), you are safe (protected)'." <br>  <br>  [013:011]  For him (the Messenger) is a succession of angels before him and behind him; they guard him by the command of ALLAH. Surely, ALLAH changes not the condition of a people until they change that which is in their hearts. And when ALLAH decides to punish a people, there is no repelling it, nor have they any helper besides HIM.|`|202e38228c40be28d23db18e1a8c07e6aa	All faiths have people that interpret their beliefs in the way best serves him, but media is extremely biased therefore this is all you see.

Girls and women have a lot more emotional freedom than boys or men. They have a lot more latitude in dress.  Whatever your opinion on homosexuality, you have to acknowledge that society allows lesbians far more freedom to openly show affection in public than it does gay men. Girls and women are in far more TV advertising than men--in fact, boys are rarely used, probably because they don’t talk as easily or as readily as girls their age. In the U. S. military, women aren’t allowed in combat. Are men’s lives that much less valuable than those of women? One more interesting observation on the gender bias our society has against males: Have you ever seen a photo of a boy or man on a swing? In my view, males have only one advantage, if you want to call it that: Society does allow them to be more child-like.|`|MJ5juxzpaa	no. girls have it hard. physically, mentally and emotionally..<br>  don't compare boys to girls.|`|t8OM0APyaa	I get it hard at least 4 times a day.|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	God Bless You, I Hope Your Week Is Blessed, God is Good.|`|Ai4tL5G9aa	Ya Boys get it hard too|`|YDUmTJataa	Just thought I'd say . . .

AA12316360	Unless things have changed in the last 20 or so years, you would have no problem getting into a lesbian club.  I used to share a flat with a gay guy, and we went clubbing together all the time, I am a straight female, but I preferred going to gay clubs, so that I could dance, chill and wahtever, without feeling like a piece of meat, occasionally we would arrive at a club on Lesbian night, we would be asked "you do realise this is lesbian night?" and as long as we were fine with it, so were they, I saw more than one pre and post op transexual, of both types, male to femal and vice versa, though usually, more often they were pre op male to femal, and like you, would be considered lesbians post op.  I did get asked out, for drinks and to dance a fair bit, but I would explain that I was just there to dance, and be left to it, I talked and hung out and danced with many a people and as long as I was clear about my intentions, i e going somewhere to dance and not being hit on, I don't ever remember there ever being a problem.  I live in London so there were plenty of places to chose from, but depending on the location, you sometimes find that lesbians and transexuals will sek to go to the same club, as they understand each other, are coming from a minority point of view, and often there is only a lesbian club, not a transexual club, so you take the fun where you can get it, and I don't mean sex, I just mean what you said, dancing and hanging out. <br>  <br>  Although many will go looking to make an easy pick up, this is the same as it is in straight clubs, possibly less so, I certainly have felt more like I am in a meat market in straight clubs than I ever have at a lesbian or gay club, which was precisely the reason I used to go there.  I think you would find it no problem at all, and would be understood.  Saying that, in any situation in lfe, there can be people who are just plain mean spirited, and you may become a target for them, as anyone could, but just bear in mind, their comments and treatment of you says more about them than it does about you, and I think you would find this a rare occurence, if at all.  Have fun when you do go.|`|1evqSw67aa	yes no problem|`|aDQCs2yAaa	girls can go into gay bars so why not........|`|cbY6NoHSaa	I sure you are fine wat are they gonna do? strip you naked just to see if your a girl?|`|xDom6mr3aa	wooo chill out!

I do have a problem with people who don't see my way not because I am smarter but because I feel that the way I see most things is morally more correct than say social conservatives. For instance, I live in CA where prop 8 passed, I have a problem because even if people don't like it, why should they get a say in the rights of others? When conservatives use their rights to infringe upon those that want rights, it is wrong. Another is the issue of abortion. I understand issues like pro life is important to them but just because we have abortions doesn't mean they need to pick at it because there are some cases where abortion is necessary such as rape. The way i see it pro choice is allowing the freedom to have that option jsut in case where as pro life they want to limit that freedom. And we have to ask why in the world do they care about other people getting abortions, are they going to take care of all the babies that don't get a home? No, they are nuts for standing on their pedastool ranting about how abortion is murder and not doing **** for the children that didn't get aborted but abandoned. If they care about life so much, take care of the ones that already exist. In my honest opinion we would not have wars if we were all liberals and atheist.<br>  edit: plus I don't see as many angry liberals as the conservatives.

4Pk6VNftaa	The Japanese writing system uses 3 different character sets:<br>  <br>  Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.<br>  <br>  Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic.  Each character has 1 pronunciation, and you put characters together to form words.  You can write entirely in Hiragana or Katakana, and be understood, however it'll look weird.  Both hiragana and katakana are made up of 107 different characters.  Just think of them like letters, basically.<br>  <br>  Hiragana is used for words of Japanese origin - names, parts of grammar, and so on.<br>  <br>  Katakana is used for words of non-Japanese (and non-Chinese) origin.  This includes your name, and loan-words Japanese has picked up from the West.  For example, computer is "konpyutaa" in Japanese.<br>  <br>  Kanji are what gives people (both Japanese and non-Japanese) the most problem.  Kanji are actually Chinese characters that the Japanese have borrowed.  Chinese characters may represent a single syllable to be combined with other characters, or an entire word.  Unlike Chinese, a Kanji character in Japanese has at least 2 pronunciations.  One is based on the original Chinese pronunciation, and other is based on how the Japanese wanted to use the character.<br>  <br>  Kanji are used for many Japanese words, combined with other Kanji or Hiragana.<br>  <br>  Although it may sound complicated, after you get used to it, the different writing systems help you break up sentences more easily.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  田中さん　は　ハンバガー　を　食べました。<br>  Tanaka-san ha, hanbagaa wo tabemashita.<br>  <br>  Broken into pronunciation by character:<br>  (ta)(naka)(sa)(n) (ha) (ha)(n)(ba)(gaa) (wo) (ta)(be)(ma)(shi)(ta)<br>  <br>  In English this means "Mr. Tanaka ate a hamburger."<br>  <br>  田中 - kanji characters for the family name, Tanaka<br>  <br>  さん - hiragana characters for a title equivalent to Mr or Mrs.<br>  <br>  は - hiragana character, this is a grammar particle, used to denote the subject of the sentence (tanaka-san)<br>  <br>  ハンバガー　- katakana characters for the loanword "Hamburger"<br>  <br>  を　- hiragana character, grammar particle denoting an object<br>  <br>  食 - Kanji character, meaning "food" or "eat"<br>  べました - Hiragana characters, modifies the verb.  In this case, it shows past tense, so put together, this verb means "ate".<br>  <br>  Note that the verb is made up of kanji and hiragana characters.  Verbs in Japanese will usually be written this way, with the root meaning being a Kanji character, and one or more Hiragana characters modifying it, such as changing its tense (will eat vs. ate) or other forms.  Much of Japanese grammar revolves around verb endings.  In fact, you can state an entire sentence just by uttering the verb.  The subject is often left off altogether, as it's assumed by context.  For instance, if you're sitting there holding a hamburger, there's no need to say "I am eating a hamburger".  You could just say "Eating a hamburger" or even just "Eating".  Who is doing the eating and what is being eaten is pretty clear already.|`|7f19096dfc203109750db707ef0faeedaa	Your question is garbled, but you seem to be asking about the Japanese written language.

69de6104d019d89c3645faeb4e808647aa	They legally get to do immoral acts on you while telling you that they are the moral ones. What I mean by this is they manipulate and psychologically skew reality until you think the way that they do. THIS is no different than brainwashing and cult behavior. It ought to be illegal and everyone who knows of such a place ought to get together with friends and a van and go down and BREAK THESE people OUT and HIDE THEM from these bastards that claim to be doing gods work. HOW many GAY CHILDREN commit suicide EACH DAY? THIS has to stop. STOP telling people that theyre SICK or UNLOVABLE BY "God" because theyre gay, this is so damn Naziesque. Please understand that fat men in drag do not represent the majority of homosexuals, they just represent the ones who want to be seen at these events. Most peple think Im straight and look shocked when I tell them. Alot of gays are 'fat' because theyre depressed as hell- and theyre depressed because society tells them theyre NOT wanted. They dress in drag because the ONLY role models gays have are those who go out of their way to stand out, the flamboyant ones in drag. If gays became more ACCEPTED in society you would see more people like myself representing the gay community instead og 'fat' drag queens. I PERSONALLY dislike the whole shake your *** in tight leather shorts while wearing lipstick and saying "hey honey!!!!" because it continues the idea in straight peoples minds that we are freaks. But like I said, its the gays with balls enough to get out in public and say "Im HERE IM QUEER GET USED TO IT" that are getting the attention, and unfortunately theyre the only role modles. THANK GOD Neil Patrick Harris came out of the closet. OTHERS like him need to stand up and say ya know, Im gay, and I look like everyone else and act like everyone else, so use me as a role model to show youre gay. Up until recently its just been the ones who apparently are so depressed that they feel they have nothing to lose by 'showing their asses' in public. Which is really what I feel that sort of behavior is, acting like a fool. BUT, thats my opinion and as Harvey Firestein (sp?) once said "exposure, at ANY cost"----but the cost seems to be having everyone believe that all gays act this way.|`|AA11279122	I don't wanna even guess....other than take your money I don't see them doing much else.|`|b5f9d17b4049275bafae24cadf3b6cc7aa	I have heard of these places, the first answer has got me thinking how horrible these places really are.

I don't care if I turn out to be a fat old dyke, at least I will be a loving and peaceful being that does not bother anyone else.  So the first answerer has my vote.  These are not pleasant places at all.  Peace.|`|7a077a0abfa0068d7a36ef587f15ae43aa	They deprive you of any contact with family or friends during your stay so you feel isolated and confused enough to be vulnerable and alone. They need to cultivate feelings in gay men a sense of confusion so their brand of brainwashing will take effect.<br>  <br>  They get you to punch a pillow and this gets the gay guy to get aggressive and angry - so he will be too physically tired to argue or question their brainwashing techniques.<br>  <br>  Then they put you on a low calorie diet so you feel lethargic and too tired to question the stupid regime of aversion therapy. They show you films of gay men undergoing shock treatment, gay men urinating on each other and fat men in drag to make the prospect or state of being gay an undesireable one.<br>  <br>  They tell you that God hates gay men and that if they don't repent they will burn in Hell forever. They tell the gay men that their parents will no longer love them if they don't 'turn' straight.|`|AA11332227	Probably the first answer above is as good an answer that your will receive. But I would like to refer to Garfields answer above. <br>       If you don't know what re-orientation camps are, you should not offer your misguided comments,<br>    Those who are subjected to these camps do not do so voluntarily. They are forced to attend, usually by their parents or or ministers of their church. They are made to feel so guilty of their orientation that they feel they must change. However there is absolutely no proof of anyone changing their sexual orientation. They may stop having sexual relations with the same sex, however. the attractions are still there. Often they try straight marriage thinking that will 'cure' them or at the very least it will appease their parents. However this usually ends in disaster and results in passing their misery and unhappiness to the innocent spouse. <br>     So I repeat - please don't discuss subjects that you obviously know nothing about.<br>  <br>  Re Garfied's reply; Thank-you for proving my point. And by the way, these reorientation groups do exist.|`|e429dbe9a1a69f38b8fe04ebf246a7cdaa	If what Flashy Ashley says is true I can see why they would leave that all out of the brochure.

Did you nkow that american soldiers who can translate arabic have been kicked out of the military for being homosexual and no other reason? Why are they so afraid of us to the point of risking the loss of a war? Theyre now complaining that they dont have enough arabic translators, well, they DID Have enough until they booted them out.

But they didn't have any expectations, and yet they still said they felt tired and all that.<br>  <br>  If you'd been practicing at doing this kind of thing for a while, then you could learn how to do  it without being a natural psi-vamp.

Schools, shopping malls, night-clubs, movie theaters, stores, cafes, and sporting events are all places with alot of ambient energy. Drawing on this doesn't hurt anyone, because it's not attached to them. People radiate off energy all the time, sort of like radiating off heat or breathing out air.<br>  <br>  Next, you should find a good online real vampire forum to discuss this stuff with others and read the articles and advice there. These are a few of the better ones:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sphynxcatvp.nocturna.org/" rel="nofollow">http://sphynxcatvp.nocturna.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sanguinarius.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sanguinarius.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://psychicvampire.org/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://psychicvampire.org/index.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.darknessembraced.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.darknessembraced.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://vcmb.org/family/" rel="nofollow">http://vcmb.org/family/</a><br>  <br>  Here are a couple of really good YouTube channels:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SinkIntoYourSleep" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/SinkIntoYour...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/vampirezilchy" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/vampirezilch...</a><br>  <br>  I also reccomend listening to these interviews with Michelle Belanger and buying a copy of The Psychic Vampire Codex and Vampires in Their Own Words.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFWfkUWJLg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shFWfkUWJ...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cItnwxYw7T8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cItnwxYw7...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.shadowdancepodcast.com/2006/10/23/shadowdance-011-vampires-and-otherkin-and-therians-oh-my/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shadowdancepodcast.com/2006/1...</a><br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you now is to relax and stay rational and practical.

You may simply be addicted to the energy, as it causes a rush.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Yur funny.|`|oxsawg31aa	LOL I think the only thing you need is a psych assessment|`|9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	Sorry mate, I'm honestly trying to take this seriously but I'm finding it hard, it just doesn't make sense. Especially since Psychic Vampires aren't even part of a legend or of folklore never mind facts.<br>  But who knows you could have tapped into something that doesn't mean you are a vampire though.<br>  A link to the website would be useful (use add details) but other than that just stop doing whatever it is that your doing. If you find it addictive then distract yourself, if that doesn't work then rely on willpower, or if it comes to it get away from people and spend some time on your own that way you can't do anything. <br>  Dont start reading that website again it will just confuse you, there are some really strange people on the net.<br>  <br>  Like I said I'm a sceptic and I'm struggling to take this seriously, I tried to give you some serious advice above but what I'm actually thinking is that it's probably all in your head. Try to forget about vampires and that website then move on from that idea.|`|JMOLRKRraa	well there is a site, think sangerian, I read, someone listed, and you could have drained someone, however, most listed, stated they do not abuse the power or ability. Then some suggested going where alot of people are and taking just a little from each, like a mall, club, whatever. Stop doing that to those people, they are extending their hospitality to you. People should put up psychic defenses for such people as you. I think I get an energy boost from sex relations with my guy, like I need an energy transfer, as women help men to relax. So obvious.<br>  But feeding off someone, might lead to punishments. I heard someone mention , when he visited hell, he saw a person eating their arm, they would throw it up, the arm would regrow, and they would eat their arm again, over and over throughout eternity. And the person was told that is the punishment for witchcraft. I never really understood that. But now can understand better. Eating, draining someone else's astral body excessively and needlessly. And dead witches and such, love to hook up, shadow, and such, the living for as long as they can. they feed off others energies.<br>  I think you should go to a night club. Alot of dancing, high energy level, and already much darker energy.<br>  Now for the most amazing part, Jesus, my God, tells me, the believer to eat His Body and Drink His Blood. Well He is God, all powerful, mighty, and as big as He wants to be, so He can feed everyone.<br>  So there is an element of feeding off others. As Christians we are only told to feed off Jesus. I don't have the energy level to feed anyone else.<br>  And the psi energy thing I can understand. I figure I should probably get more around other people, that might help me lift my energy level.<br>  I try to never abuse any of my powers. When I pass a test I get more power. Fail a test and I risk losing all powers. And then in your case, your karma would be, you providing food for others, while not eating yourself, astrally. Be more careful and considerate.<br>  I think anyone can do what you did. has nothing to do with being a vampire.|`|SMrSII2eaa	You're 17, but you can't even spell "tried"?<br>  Wow<br>  Like I believe you're 17 haha<br>  More like a twelve year old that is obsessed with Twilight|`|BLRQoo5Naa	i think you are just saying that to amuse yourself|`|rBTxIbh0aa	there was this book i read a while back about psi ppl in one chapter it described dif ways to block the flow of power it was and i quote as best i can "close ur eyes and imagin a two way flow of water or road any thing that works for u then imagine a wall not a fence but a Solid wall of steel that blocks off all flow in both directions" keep that image in ur head and remember it.eventually after doing this ur sub consus mind will do this for u and it will stop u from taking ppls energy..if u want to get energy imagine that road or what ever ur image is and imagine that wall disappearing after u are done remember to put that wall back in place and u should be fine now as far as wanting it all the time that just comes down to self control and practice
jcK6EXpiaa	Unless they are married, never. Unless they plan on moving out of my home. Fornication is against my beliefs. But when my kids are teenagers or adults, I will have little control over their actions. Hopefully, inshallah, I will have installed moral values in them, as well as self esteem and sense. One thing my mom always said to my siblings and I was "If its love, get married" or "Condoms are cheaper than diapers!".<br>  <br>  Edit: Its not that I want my kids to feel ashamed about sexuality. Far from it. I think sex is what makes a spiritual union (like marriage) strong. I discourage pre marital sex for many reasons, one that its a sin, another because when sex happens outside of a committed relationship, it always has negative results (and this can even happen in an unhealthy committed relationship) even if it is nothing more than shame. But usually those results could be much worse, especially if the participants are teenage kids who realise too late that they were not ready for the emotional aspect of a sexual relationship (especially the girls).|`|k9gp11PMaa	I'm not a mother yet (14), but I know that I cant give the permission 2 have sex, its up 2 them.

I mean realistically you can't stop kids from having sex.<br>  <br>  I'm 16 so my POV may be different but I think I would have the least problem with my child having sex in his or her late teens and early 20s. You can't really put a specific number on that because people mature at different times and the situation comes at different ages. <br>  <br>  I'm less worried about her having sex then getting hurt and I think that deciding to have sex with someone is a big decision and should be when you feel you are ready and it is with the right person (someone you love and trust who loves you), and you are both responsible and using protection.|`|RB0ICpJCaa	Depends. If I had a child and they showed signs of maturity. Then I don't think I would have a problem with it. As long as they are comfortable with talking to me about sex. (kinda) Then I will have no problem buying birth control or condoms for them, to make sure they are safe. The more supporting you are, the less likely your child will rebel and end up hurting them selves. There is nothing wrong with sex. it is only natural. You can't stop it. So be supportive. But if my son or daughter is not in their senior year, I would sit them down and explain to them how I felt about it, and prefer that they wait. But I would still take them to the doctor to make sure they are protected. (pill/condoms)|`|6sJhoXAAaa	It's not about "letting", they will when they will regardless of my opinion.

I also hope they feel free to talk to me about it.|`|B0ioojMMaa	no particular age actually i wouldnt like to consent it but it will depend on how mature my children are, for instance if theyre the type of having unprtected sex the no i would strictly forbid it but i will teach them about sti's and getting pregnant or getting someone pregnant, but some just dont care as long as they're having sex (which is stupid) other than that if they have protected sex and not with everyone for instance if they do it with the same person its ok but thay'd have to be a litlle old like 17 or 18 but age doesn't determine  your maturity so if i had an immature 18 year old id be like absolutley nooooooo!|`|xj8QZyykaa	What do you mean 'let'?

toSnUTMUaa	Meditation—the process of pondering over what we have learned through study—is invaluable. It helps us to get God’s thoughts off the printed page and into our heart. Meditation helps us to see how to apply Bible counsel so that we become “doers of the word, and not hearers only.” (James 1:22-25) Moreover, meditation helps us to draw ever closer to Jehovah, for it enables us to reflect on his qualities and how they are highlighted in the material being considered during periods of study.<br>  18 To benefit fully from study and meditation, we must keep the mind clear of distractions. In order to make room for new information when we meditate, we need to shut out the distractions of present-day living. Doing this takes time and solitude, yet, how refreshing it is to partake of the spiritual food and the waters of truth found in God’s Word!<br>  <br>  I think the kind of meditation you are talking about is a little different. you have to be careful when experimenting with different types of relaxation, because when your mind is empty, and you are in a trance, satan and his wicked spirit forces( demons) can take advantage of your mind and body. (and yes, it has happened before) romans 12 :1, 2 says: “Present your bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason. And quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.” Our minds need to be alert so we can use our "power of reason" to make wise choices that honor God.|`|3SHfl8myaa	Biblically we are to meditate upon His Word and His goodness.<br>  <br>  Opening of the third eye is to do with psychic abilities which are expressly forbidden in Scripture.<br>  <br>  If you meditate and think about scriptures and promises from God concerning depession and anxiety I believe His promises could become reality for you, but you need to look for God in the right place.|`|si3eq11haa	the third eye is usually satanic. but meditation in itself is just setting your thoughts on something, mulling them over, considering them. so considering God, thinking about Him, that's a good thing, and yes, if you spend time thinking about God, and if you want to find Him, He will be found by you. talk to Him and ask Him into your life, He works wonders with depression...<br>  ask Him now, i  think He is waiting to hear your voice....|`|rWP4suXuaa	As long as you meditate on Gods word.<br>  <br>  <br>  God loves you...god bless|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Meditation while praying the rosary has many benefits, such as the following:<br>  <br>  The rosary is explained here:<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...</a><br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles.

If you are a Christian, this is the only form of "meditation" you should be doing.|`|HFlytHlRaa	No. In fact several religious figures were said to have meditated in the Bible. The fasting for 30 days, while served other purposes, was also an intense method of meditation. I believe Lisa "Left Eye" Lopez was said to have found God through fasting for 30 days and intense meditation as have several other people have reported this.<br>  <br>  All meditation is, is concentrated thinking and reflection. There is nothing wrong with that. I (try) to meditate myself for at least ten minutes a day.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	The Bible does not prohibit meditation. Some religious leaders are against it because it eliminates the need for them. It strengthens your connection to your soul.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend meditating. If nothing else it is good for your health. It enhances your brain health and can allow you to reprogram your emotions and your psychological state. If you want to know more about meditating feel free to email me. It can help w/ depression.|`|n7mVqA3Raa	Psalm 1:1-3<br>  Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful;<br>  But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night.<br>  He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.<br>  <br>  Read Psalm 23<br>  The Lord is my Shepherd: I shall not want.<br>  <br>  The Word of God is a balm to heal the sin sick soul.<br>  The Psalm is a chapter written mostly by David in troubled times. If you can read this you will find calm. Before you read, pray and ask the Lord to send His comfort. It works if you believe. Read James 2:14|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes, meditating on the word helps depression and it can cure it, but the Lord may tell you to do some exercise too.  Nevertheless, we do need to meditate on the word.  The Bible teaches us to do that.  Psalm 1:1-3 says that we are blessed if we meditate on the word often, and not only that we will be highly successful if we keep on doing this, (not as the world counts success, but success in whatever we need to be doing according to the will  of God).  Do you have a Bible?  If not you need to get one and read the words of Jesus in red letters in the book of John.  Read the whole book 3 times.  Read Psalm and Proverbs every day and the whole New Testament, Genesis and Exodus, Isaiah.  (those would help depression better basically).  Mark the key Scriptures with a highlighter that doesn't bleed through the pages, then go back and memorize these.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you some, and may the Lord guide you and bless you in marvelous ways!

DfDss68haa	I feel you. I used to be a big gossip and was constantly hating on people for living their life (sometimes still do). And I would always do it around specific friends. I had whole friendships where all we did was talk about people at school. "Can you believe what she was wearing? Can you believe what he came to the party with HER? Her hair looked like two cats got in a fight."<br>  <br>  THINGS YOU CAN DO:<br>  1. Realize where this gossip comes from. Usually gossips and those who judge are people who are unhappy with their own lives. Make yourself happy and you have no need to be looking at other people's lives. <br>  <br>  2. Rent the movie Mean Girls. Funny and true. <br>  <br>  3. Sometimes gossip and making fun of people is fun and it happens when you get around certain friends. I made a pact with my other gossipy friend that we don't talk about other people for 30 days. And surpisingly we had a lot of fun and our friendship was actually more meaningful becuase we were doing fun stuff instead of making fun of other people doing fun stuff. Make a pact with your friends and see how long you can go without talking about people behind their back. Put a wager on it if makes it more fun. Like the losers have to pay $10 or something. It might feel stupid to say "I don't talk about people anymore." It can be tough to five gossiping up becuase it helps you bond with your friends but you have to stand up for what's right sometimes. Also if this doesn't work, get new friends. <br>  <br>  4. When you are saying something, think about how it would make you feel if someone was saying it about you. <br>  <br>  5. Also realize that when you are hating on someone, deep inside you are really jealous of them and wish you were as brave as they were to take risks and be themselves. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXC0bQZ2zZI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXC0bQZ2z...</a><br>  Ignore the green eyes monster<br>  <br>  6.

I can clearly cook my own food and enjoy doing and its cheaper. My husband and I like to eat a lot of rice and we also love potatoes, we eat a lot of salads. We only eat lean meat, mostly chicken and turkey breast, but some beef. we eat TONS of vegetables and fruits, all in all we eat really healthy. I wouldn't say Americans fault is the quality of food we eat, its the amount and the amount of exercise we get.

The result is something geneticists call "hybrid vigor".  This same phenomena is observed in plants and animals.  Hybrid vigor genetically magnifies survival attributes, and in humans that includes height.<br>  <br>  Secondly, we eat more meat; it's not the growth hormones (what nonsense), it's the amount of protein that spurs early puberty and, as a result, height.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|AA11036328	mmmfmfmfmhehehehehahahaha|`|1dbca8d3a05aba6cf3b0050aaaef7aedaa	Fi fi fo fum...I smell the blood of an Englishman...|`|8ff5ad29886d4fc89fa837bf35c60b70aa	yeah i know!!!

There is a lopsided ratio of about 10 bottoms to 1 top.  it's the real truth.  I've seen this all my life.<br>  <br>  Most guys who like to f-u-c-k- someone else are usually straight guys.   they know their job is to shag a woman.  there is no confusion or doubt about that.  when straight guys and broads come together - both of them know who will stick what into whom.  No confusion there.<br>  <br>  problem is that not enough guys out there have realized how wonderful it feel to be inside another man's a-s-s and to come inside him.  if they only knew - but they don't realize.it. <br>  <br>  Another reason is that many guys are lazy and don't want to pump.  They want to sit back and take it while the stud (top) does the driving .  And it's easier to be a passive bottom than to be an active top - because - just like in the hetero world - the topguy has to PROVE himself & take responsibility to make the woman come & satisfy her.  same with the gay topguy - he is in charge and must satisfy the bottom.  <br>  <br>  and most guys who want to penetrate are found more in the straight world.   they prefer the vagina to the rectum of a man.  And so those guys who like to get shagged GRAVITATE to the gay world.  they have no choice.  <br>  <br>  Topguys could shag either women or passive men.   BUt bottom guys have no option but to try to seduce some guy to give it to them.  their choices are more limited.<br>  <br>  So now are we clear about this matter. ???????????????<br>  <br>  I sure hope so.|`|6dadcb0550a6127e9078d42b04ada1d7aa	I have more of a top.|`|9784cdd597c55561a1f02deabbb1d018aa	Most Same Gender Loving males are still under the impression that they have to portray a submissive role due to their sexuality. Historically, females have been (forced to have been) submissive while males have been in the dominant role...get ready for the twist with this.<br>  <br>  Males who like males oftentimes feel (whether at an early age or later) that they are to portray themselves in this submissive female role. There along with having feminine traits, the male attempts to (as much as possible) fulfill this female role. Henceforth, they are the passive (or bottoms).<br>  <br>  My thoughts on male-male sex is that we both have our "swinging richards" so we both should use them on each other. If we are only "tops" then we should just be heterosexual...tops can get the same sexual treatment (and then some) from females versus banging a "bottom's" booty...just a thought.|`|fb0c7c7c59783d62e1d3678257da0a80aa	Mostly guys seem to be vers to me.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	I, for one, have noticed no such disparity.  Most guys I've been involved with were quite comfortable with either role as the mood took us both, as am I.  The idea that one must a "top" or a "bottom", with no change in role ever, strikes me as overly limiting, like saying one must be either "straight" or "gay" with bi not an option.  Human sexuality is way too complex and varied to be pigeonholed into that kind of black/white over generalization.|`|3a72219446c9a5a85bf1448f6d4a2860aa	Dunno. Thems the breaks.

df6bb32a8d685e1ccecdaf581dbd50dfaa	That's an excellent point, being a christian and a drug-user should not be mutually exclusive.  It should also be noted that not every drug user is an addict; just like not everyone who drinks alcohol in any form (in church, on New Year's, etc) is an alcoholic (that last is not specifically directed at your question, but at some of the answers).  <br>  <br>  Drugs will always be outlawed in the US, simply because there is too much money to be made off of them as illegal substances.  The addiction and mortality rate of drugs here in the states is a number of times higher than other countries' who have legalized many or most of the drugs we deem 'harmful' and 'addictive'.  By the same token, however, alcohol is legalized here, and we still more than double most other countries' addiction/mortality rates on that.  So, I think that those results point more to a mentality than a legalization.  In a country where open-mindedness is prevalent, and people are not persecuted simply for having different beliefs (in other words, a country not ruled by control-freaks), people do not believe that doing drugs in any way detracts from faith.  It would be similar to saying: if you choose to sleep late and relax on weekends, as opposed to getting up at 5am and cleaning, you must not be a good ______ (insert faith).  They are completely unrelated, and have no bearing or influence on each other.  <br>  <br>  In many cases, politicians who are 'conservative' or 'christian conservative' receive a good portion of their campaign funds from groups that are either anti-drug or targeting drugs.  If they were to take a stand, they would lose countless campaign dollars and probably lose their following term.  People in general are just not educated about drug use, and ignorance breeds fear.  It is only recently that scientists in the UK have begun testing on the qualities of hallucinogenic mushrooms, and their positive effects on clinically depressed people.  So we are still in a 'dark age' when it comes to illegal drugs (although I find it interesting that the US once again blows every other country out of the water when it comes to people using prescription drugs).  I think that once people in the US are able to overcome their fear of the unknown, you will see a drastic change in the condition of the culture.  Although, that may just be my idealism.<br>  <br>  I understand what you are saying about government intrusion, but could you please further clarify the importance of 'personal responsibility'?  Do you intend emphasis on personal, wherein people should simply mind their own business and not try to control everyone around them?|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	If you love your opiod painkillers and Buddhism, why do you care what Christians think?

Most everyone knows someone who's either addicted to something, has died from drug use or is getting there, or is raising kids while totally blasted.  That's why people are against drugs.<br>  <br>  I have no desire to "convert" you, we have enough crackpots already.|`|AA11638424	...On the other hand, why do you encourage irresponsibility?  If you really do all the drugs you say (I do tend to doubt it) how is this beneficial to you and others?  You not only would destroy yourself, but it sounds you seek to take others down to destruction with you.  "Love does no wrong to a neighbor; love is the fulfillment of the Law", we are told in Romans 13.   This is not loving on your part.<br>  ...The Bible does say that the body of the Christian is the temple of the Holy Spirit - not only is this an incredible honor, but we are to take good care of ourselves, and we belong to God.<br>  ...The other principle I think of is this: we are to do all things to the glory of God - you tell me how I can fry my brains with illegal  drugs to the glory of God.  I can't - to do so is quite inconsistent with sound doctrine.<br>  ...And as you have said, we are to obey the laws of the land.  I am for law enforcement.  Government, although imperfect, is to look out for the welfare of the citizenry, not hasten its demise.  It is ordained by God to punish evildoers, by execution if necessary. (Romans 13)<br>  ...If you really insist on living this way, you will hasten your own demise, or at least wind up in jail - its your choice, and if you make the wrong choice and get caught, you have no one to blame but yourself.<br>  ...You don't need to turn over a new leaf - you need new life in Christ - only then can you have peace, joy, a reason for living, power for living, and a guaranteed spot in Heaven when you die.  I urge you to "believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and be saved."|`|aa98ad0f9cb6b9158441507e5d5cdab6aa	OK.  christians point of view...I will try not to be stupid or convert you   ;-)  <br>  <br>  God made us with a certain state of mind and he told us that our body is a temple (I'm sure you've heard that one before).  It also says in the Bible that drunkenness is a sin.  I think that being altered by a drug goes under the drunk category.  Alcohol and drugs alter your mind state.  Some (all?) drugs ruin your body and your mind forever.   That's the Christian side of it.<br>  <br>  The secular side is that people who become addicted to drugs change.  They begin to care less about their families, their jobs, their friends, etc.  Everything that was once important, including the lives of other people, is forgetten in pursuit of that good feeling that drugs give them.  I don't think that drugs is a Christian moral being imposed on the rest of society.  I think it is just experience or even common sense on the lawmakers' parts.<br>  <br>  Now, homosexual marriage?  That is probably a Christian moral being imposed on society.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS - Being emotionless isn't exactly good.  From a Christian perspective: We were created to have emotions.  It is part of the "in God's image" thing.<br>  <br>  From a non-Christian perspective: I've known people who take anti-depressants that make them emotionless and they are in capable of properly loving their families, incapable of caring whether certain things which need to be done are done (such as paying bills and keeping their bank accounts out of the hole).  I'm just not seeing much good out of this.|`|2715b6f0a672e7157058744d0fb6c4ffaa	baptism doesent ruin lives. whens the last time you heard of a baby being found lying on the floor of a dirty house with crappie diaper half starved to death because the mother was baptized?<br>  drugs cause sickness, which requires healthcare, wich costs money, which addicts dont have. who pays for it? taxpayers.<br>  i could go on and on with this one, what a stupid question!|`|827a6af20619e034625e6f217dec5f6faa	No- you are right- the Bible makes no mention of drugs, per se... however the Bible makes it very clear we are not to abuse anything- and we are not to take things ( alcohol ) that will interfere or alter our thinking.

If you do then you have much to learn. If you think that whites and blacks don't band together to help each other then you would have been very surprised to have seen who was helping who during the aftermath of Katrina. I lived through Katrina and I saw first hand that when there is a disaster of this magnitude people for the most part are color blind, but since you brought up intelligence and murder let's have a chat.<br>  You asked if George Bush was intelligent. Sure he is. Has he made some stupid judgement calls? Sure  he has. Is that an indication of his intelligence level? Nope.If you want to point out famous blacks whose intelligence level is questionable lets look at Tupac. He spewed venom and hatred in his "Songs"(I use the word song lightly). He lived by the gun and he died by the gun. He promoted violence and he died a violent death. Was he intelligent? I don't think so. Dr. Martin Luther King, he was a peaceful man who had some wonderful ideas. He was before his time and he was killed due to ignorance and fear. Do you know about Wayne Bertram Williams from Atlanta? He was a black man who was a peodphile. He was convicted of killing 22 children in the Atlanta area and is suspected of 33 killings. Or have you heard of coral Eugene Watts? He was a black man who was a prolific serial killer in Texas, Michigan and Canada. He confessed to 13 rapes and murders but is suspected in 80 murders. White folks do not have the market cornered on killing, rape, sodomy, pedophlia, or any of the other heinous crimes one can think of. Humans do, but crime is not race specific. Intelligence is not race specific either.<br>  As to MaDonna and Angelina, they are wealthy women with too much money and too much time on their hands. Be honest, if they had quietly adopted children from any third world country and they had given out of their desire to have a child not to gain publicity would the world know about it?<br>  Let me tell you about a woman that you will never hear about. I will not give her last name, but her first name is Leanna. she raised her own six kids by herself while she worked three jobs. Not only did she raise her kids but she took in fourteen others over the course of 20 years. s<br>  She has raised all these kids to adulthood. Not one of them has a criminal record, all but three have a junior college or college degree. two are physicians, one is a lawyer, five are nurses.The others have good steady middle class to upper middle class jobs. they are engineers, teachers, a couple are pastors of local churches.  Why don't you know about her and the scores of others like her black and white? Because they aren't rich and giving out of their excess for media coverage. <br>  In short, you don't have nearly enough information to accurately debate your argument. When you have more information and can argue in an intelligent manner, post your question again. Until then it seems to me that you are just another young person with some half truths and a cross to bear.|`|bf621e05dd1c4f89ff36b9fdce162254aa	It is because racism is ingrained in the culture of your country.

Por eso el freno debe ser más potente que el motor. Dios nos creó por amor con libertad, pero nosotros nos comportamos con libertinaje. Dios no interviene porque al respetar la libertad que nos dio se repeta a sí mismo. La maldad en el corazón crece porque nos alejamos de Dios y en lugar de espiritualizarnos nos materializamos.

That's important because there are so many divisions amongst Protestantism and many Protestants don't wish to recognise Catholics as first Christians, (its an inferiority complex of theirs I believe).<br>  <br>  Regardless many zealous Christians are instructed you'll burn in hell if not converted (usually these are the fundamentalist types)<br>  <br>  The less zealous with authentic authority and apostolic succession understand that conversion of anybody requires the intercession of the Holy Spirit it is never them alone.

Not always "pestering" people about how our belief is the only right one. I have seen at least a hundred people become christians. Do u know why? Not because of a theological arguement, but because the reality of the gospel. Christians are called to raise the dead, heal the sick, and cleanse the lepers. Sadly not many( in north america especially) do this or even believe it's right to do so. Jesus is real i have seen him heal many people, including blind eyes, broken limbs, and cancer. Before you dismiss christianity, look into denominations that believe in the power of the Holy Spirit. I probably wouldnt truly believe christianity if i had not seen how much power Jesus has. Many christians have experianced the supernatural, at a depth NO other religion or cult could dream of.

For him to have walked away would have been for him to deny that he was God.  God is not a covenant breaker---he must fulfill his promises, and God promised a Savior in his prophesies of the Old Testament.  Read Isaiah chapter 53 and pay particular attention to verse 5.  In the garden at Gethsemane, Jesus was not asking the heavenly Father to free him from the cross, but was asking him if there was any other way.  If there was not, then he was willing to obey his Father and go to the cross.  Jesus was not having second thoughts about the obligation that he had undertaken---God does not think twice about anything that he does.|`|aa31c3b9e60704382f19c38af231f597aa	The simple fact that Jesus is the Son of God a different person from God the Father.|`|35b8ac78ca5c09c7481fe35c062bdfa0aa	He could have saved himself, but that would not have helped us out.

No doubt about that.  He didn't HAVE to be crucified and although he didn't want to be, he CHOSE to allow them to crucify him.  He was obedient to God's will, thinking of God first and Himself second.  It was a humble request that he made in the garden that God please take this cup from him if it was possible...because it was going to be really, REALLY unpleasant for him in his earthly form.  This made the sacrifice all the more valuable (sick as that might sound).  Imagine a father finding himself faced with the choice of sacrificing one perfect child for the sake of the "black sheep" child that was always so disobedient and ungrateful.  The trouble is, the father loved his disobedient child as much as he loved the obedient one.  The father realizes what he must do: sacrifice the obedient child so that the disobedient one might be saved, too.  The obedient child (the "good" child) willingly submits to his will out of love and absolute respect, but asks the father "Is there no other way?  Please father, don't do this to me if you don't have to!"  As you can imagine, this shatters the father's already broken heart.  Can you imagine the pain of this absolute display of love?<br>  <br>  Everything God does, He does to perfection.  The sacrifice was not a full expression of his absolute love without Jesus' plea for mercy.|`|918a45ceeab38ac3e750e1c3279f6ce0aa	JESUS CHRIST who was born on this earth to wash away the sin from every human beings. he is the only one who came to this earth to save the sinner, all other came here to kill them. a good doctor is not suppose to kill his ....... but his has to save him. so the jesus christ read THE BIBLE for your satisfaction|`|93cc9f2a3bf1bdc4ad08585fbad388b8aa	He coiuld have yes, but Him dying on the cross was the only way for their to be atonment for everyone's sins.

The Holy Spirit is the vessel required to make these things possible<br>  <br>  GOD the Father= Jehovah<br>  GOD the SON= Yahweh or Jesus the CHRist(annointed one)<br>  GOD the Holy Spirit= Ruot or Holy Ghost<br>  <br>  The image of the Father=  COL 1:15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 16 For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. 17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. 18 And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. 19 For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, 20 and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.<br>  <br>    JN 5:41 "I do not accept praise from men, 42 but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. 43 I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	Jesus said when Phillip told him "Just show us the Father and we will be satisfied" Jesus said " Phillip, Phillip, have I been with you so long and you still do not recognise me?, When you see me, you see the Father"|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Shure..u asked the pope..oookkaaayyy.<br>  <br>   John 14:9   Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou [then], Shew us the Father?|`|1e2aa41e34c037a92a687f6f7fcfcd71aa	What was the question again?|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	You will never find a verse that says Jesus is God.  This is a false teaching.  There are many scriptures that say that Jesus is God's son.  But people will take a few scriptures and try to prove that the trinity is in the bible.  Not in so many words, but that the concept is implied.  Never mind that the holy spirit is a force and not a person.  That Jesus said that the only one who knows when the end will come is God.  How come Jesus doesn't know or even the Holy Spirit if they are both part of the Godhead.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	I always wondered how one can be their own father and son at the same time.

They just told us how sinful to the core we are, and despite that total depravity,  they brush it aside all of a sudden and now we are "good enough" to be able to make a choice for God.

Or did you mean psychological?<br>  <br>  The Devil is a personification.  He began as the natural challenge or test to every new idea or initiative.  His job was to ask, "Why is this good?", "Why is this bad?"  In time, he was seen as an obstacle to holiness, a bad guy, not a tester but a tempter, always to evil.  This is convenient for believers because it removes all responsibility for doubt or error.  "The devil made me do it," they say.  In truth, they failed the "test" and they blame someone else, someone imaginary.|`|df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	I would say that the answer is probably:<br>  <br>  Yes.

The Holy Bible is the inerrant word of God, dictated to men that He trust, through the Holy Spirit.  Oh yeah, I think it is the only book that explains about Satan and his "ministry" on earth.  Of course, all of this is explained in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Religion is man-made while Christianity is not.  Everything man-made is broken;not worthy to be compared to Christianity.<br>  Any religion that calls for the death of Americans and Jews is not of God; it is of Satan.  But as long as their is hate and selfishness, Satan will have a stranglehold.   God just wants everybody to have a chance at salvation and an eternal resting place.  Satan just wants to see you in hell.
AA11412999	I agree that it's not the sex that ruins the relationship; it's the lie.  <br>  <br>  I have a couple of questions.  First of all, how did you come to receive these emails and phone calls?  Usually, swingers don't go the telemarketing route, calling strangers up at random!  You have shown interest in this somewhere, somehow and you have propagated some interest.  And of course, why wouldn't they be interested?  Single (attractive, bisexual) women are called unicorns...because the odds of finding one who is sane and wants to play and finding a white unicorn are about the same.  It truly is a couple's activity because the couple goes home that night with one another.  The single woman goes home...alone and wishing she had someone to share her experience with.  No wonder it's not an attractive lifestyle to them.  <br>  <br>  But the thing of it is...you're NOT single.  You have someone in your life that has an expectation of exclusivity from you.  You have agreed to that.  If you no longer wish to have that as part of your relationship, you cannot simply do away with it on your own.  It is your husband's right to be involved in such decisions.  You rape him of his dignity when you make those decisions for him.<br>  <br>  What do you do about the invitations?  You politely turn them down, telling them the truth: that while you find the idea of swinging fascinating and exciting, you have not yet discussed it with your husband.  If the hosts respond with assurances that they "know how to be discrete", run - don't walk.  These are opportunists who have NO respect for you or your marriage.  Some people say they are not their "brother's keeper", and they will play with people who are cheating on their spouses.  My husband and I have a real problem with that, as it condones the kind of dishonesty that we have worked so hard to erradicate from our own relationship.  It means that we would be using this other person, and our blindness to her (or his) lack of integrity is a means to an end.  This is why we call it RESPONSIBLE non-monogamy.  We look out not only for our own relationship, but the well-being of others and their relationships, too.  <br>  <br>  Do yourself a favour and have a look at the website below.  Bring your dilemma to the folks there and you'll get some feedback.  But be warned!  This is a very pro-marriage community, and they will give advice to you as strong as what would be given someone who had just announced she was jumping off a cliff.  It's a very genuine community and they like to help folks out whenever they can.  It's also a fantastic place to find good quality (reliable) information about all aspects of swinging.

I'd advise you strongly to do the same.  <br>  <br>  It's not "bumping bodies" that seems to threaten relationships----it's NOT TELLING THE TRUTH about what's going on, inside your head--IMHO..  I'd recommend you read _The Ethical ****_  (you should pardon the title) by Liszt and Easton (Greenery Press)---good book on dealing with complex relationships RESPONSIBLY. <br>  <br>  He may be OK with an open relationship----and you can sure "pretend" later that he doesn't know, and have a fun, hot time (using safer sex precautions, of course).<br>  <br>  Blindsiding people  with surprises does NOT go too well with the kink community mantra of "safe, sane, and consensual"---however, your mileage may vary.|`|4e4ad56e2decb78f24efe98db56483c8aa	just tell him about it and mabey he can do something!!|`|d900b2e34cf9601f10bb1b6cefff8840aa	me personally.

Depends on what type of swingers you are looking for. Some are only into finding a single bi-female.  Those are usually only going to couples only clubs. So if you are a single female or a couple you can get in.  Some other good places are swingers personals that have a real certified couples area. Meaning that they are personally certified by the staff of the online site and not by their own self with a different profile..   I would recommend that you first join a site and then flirt a little.   The best places are  of course where the couples are certified. If you are in Las Vegas soon let us know.. we have friends at a swingers club in las vegas that can certify you so you can get in the certified couples only area of like swingersetc.com as they have Swingers Club listings and reviews too.

It can, if you have the key to this Book, itself.<br>  <br>  This is not intended to be an exposition of the Revelation - merely a brief outline to give you the key which will unlock its true meaning for you.<br>  <br>  What's going to happen, from NOW? <br>  <br>  No man can foretell these events. But we can know what will happen provided we can UNDERSTAND the prophecies of the Bible!<br>  <br>  The test of this understanding lies in the outcome of prophesied events. When a minister or evangelist uses the Bible prophecy to FORE-tell events, <br>  <br>  "...when the word of the prophet (preacher) shall come to pass, then shall the preacher be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him." (Jer. 28:9).<br>  Understanding of the prophecies can come only if we have the KEYS to the Book of Revelation - for in it alone do we find events of the various prophecies correlated in order of time-sequence.<br>  <br>  In the Book of Revelation is a STORY-FLOW, relating one event to another in order of time sequence, with occasional insets injected into the continuous story-thread. This fact is the first KEY to understanding of the Book. <br>  <br>    <br>  A REVEALING - Not a Concealing!<br>  <br>  Some believe Revelation is a closed Book, not to be understood. But the opening verse says: "The REVELATION of Jesus Christ . . . TO SHOW unto His servants things which must shortly COME to pass. " Not the hiding, concealing, or closing up - the REVEALING of Jesus Christ to SHOW events TO COME to pass. And in the last chapter it says: <br>  <br>  "Seal NOT the sayings of the prophecy." (22:10). <br>  Notice, (Rev. 1:1-2) God gave the prophecy to Christ. Christ, not John, is the Revelator, who opens to our understanding the meaning of the prophecy.<br>  <br>  John merely BARE RECORD - recorded in writing - this revealing. John recorded three things:<br>  <br>  The Word of God <br>  The testimony or direct words of Jesus <br>  The things John SAW, in vision, or in spirit. <br>  The first three verses contain the opening introduction; the remainder of the first chapter the beautiful salutation. The dominant KEY-NOTE of the Book - its subject, its theme - is revealed in the 10th, or middle verse of this chapter. This theme is "THE DAY OF THE LORD."<br>  <br>  In spirit, IN VISION, John was carried forward some 1900 years - projected, as it were, into THE LORD'S DAY, which is simply "THE DAY OF THE LORD" - the time of God's judgments and plagues upon sin at the end - where John sees, in symbols in this vision, these age-end events leading up to, and climaxing in, THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST! <br>  <br>  The THEME of the Book<br>  <br>  Not understanding this key-note verse, endless controversy and confusion has resulted from arguing as to whether the message was revealed to John and written on a Saturday or on a Sunday. But what misunderstanding! What waste of precious time! The original Greek word here translated "on," is "en." This Greek word "en" is consistently translated throughout the Revelation elsewhere as "in" or "INTO."<br>  <br>  In spirit - IN VISION - John was projected 1900 years into the future. INTO the "DAY OF THE LORD," foretold in more than 30 places in prophecy, which is the Lord's Day, the time of His judgments and plagues soon now to come. The Weymouth translation has it: <br>  <br>  "In the Spirit, I found myself present on the Day of the Lord." <br>  The Concordant Version, same as Rotherham's, translates it: <br>  <br>  "I came to be, in spirit, IN the Lord's Day."<br>  The Bullinger translation: <br>  <br>  "I came to be, by the spirit, IN the Lord's Day."<br>  John, actually on the isle of Patmos, appeared to be, in vision in the time of the "Day of the Lord," now soon to come. Just as Ezekiel (Ezek. 8:3) said, <br>  <br>  "the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem." <br>  And so the THEME of The Revelation is the events of the DAY OF THE LORD, climaxing in the Second Coming of Christ.<br>  <br>  The second and third chapters contain the messages to the seven churches. These were churches that existed at the time of the writing of the Book of Revelation. John had probably labored with them in the past. The characteristics of these churches can be found in the Church of God throughout all ages. You should study, and apply to yourself, these messages.<br>  <br>  The SETTING for the main revelation of future events is found in the fourth and fifth chapters. Here, in vision, John is taken into heaven where events TO OCCUR ON EARTH are revealed. He sees God the Father sitting on His throne, the Book of this prophecy in His right hand, sealed with SEVEN SEALS - thus completely closed to understanding. Seven denotes completeness.<br>  <br>  Before Him are the four "beasts," or living creatures, and the twenty-four elders, and in their midst stands Christ, the "Lamb of God." Christ, alone, is found worthy to open the seals and reveal the prophecy to our understanding.<br>  <br>  And fix in mind, THE SEVEN SEALS COVER THE ENTIRE BOOK. In his vision, John sees Christ take the Book from the right hand of the Father, and, one by one, in this heavenly setting, open the seals— showing us, His servants, things shortly TO COME to pass - not events AFTER they have occurred, but showing events TO COME to pass - BEFORE they occur!<br>  <br>  THE KEY to the SEVEN SEALS<br>  <br>  The opening of the first six seals is recorded in the sixth chapter. As they are opened, John records the things he SEES. But the things he sees are SYMBOLS. These symbols represent literal and real things to occur on earth.<br>  <br>  How can we understand the right meaning of these symbols? WHAT IS THE KEY? <br>  <br>  Just as Jesus spoke, during His earthly ministry, IN PARABLES to those "without" - thus veiling the true meaning so they would not understand, yet explaining, in plain language, the meaning of the parables to His own surrendered followers (Mark 4:10-12; Mat. 13:13-15), so here the prophecy is IN SYMBOL, which those "without" cannot understand— but which Jesus will explain in PLAIN LANGUAGE to His true followers who keep His Father's commandments, (Ps. 111:10) and possess the Holy Spirit. (John 16:13; Acts 5:32) Because of rebellion against God and His commandments, it is not given to all to understand. (See Dan. 12:10) Those who break and teach against the Commandments cannot understand Revelation.<br>  <br>  But just as Jesus explained the meaning of His symbolic parables to His true followers IN PLAIN LANGUAGE, so He who is the SAME yesterday, today and forever (Heb. 13:8) explains these symbols. Did Jesus, then, in PLAIN LANGUAGE explain these same events of the end-time, leading up to His second coming and age-end?<br>  <br>  He did! When His disciples, on Mount Olivet, asked Him,<br>  <br>  "Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the SIGN of Thy coming, and of the end of the age?" (Mat. 24:3) <br>  Jesus gave a startling prophecy, explaining in Plain Language these events which shall end the age.<br>  <br>  HERE, THEN, IS THE PLAIN EXPLANATION OF THE SYMBOLS! Here is the KEY that unlocks the true meaning of the seals! <br>  <br>  In His Olivet prophecy, (Mat. 24) Jesus listed these six events to-occur: 1st, false prophets or false Christs (verse 5); 2nd, wars (verse 6) throughout the age, culminating at the end-time in WORLD WAR (verse 7); 3rd, famines; 4th, pestilences (verse 7). Then Jesus digressed (compare Luke 21:12) to go back and describe the siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., because this was a type and forerunner of the coming age-end siege against Jerusalem and battle at ARMAGEDDON (compare Luke 17:30-36 with Mat. 24:17-28). Thus Mat. 24:28 and Luke 21:12-24 applies to the period of 70 A.D., only as a type of forerunner of this age-end time, to which, therefore, it literally refers. Then Jesus shows, 5th, The GREAT TRIBULATION (Mat. 24:21), followed 6th, by THE HEAVENLY SIGNS of the darkened sun and moon with the stars falling (verse 29), together with the SIGN of Christ's coming, seen in heaven (verse 30); and this was later followed by the actual COMING of Christ (verse 30).<br>  <br>  What the Seals Mean<br>  <br>  Notice how accurately this explains the symbols of the six seals of Rev. 6: When the 1st SEAL is opened (Rev. 6:1) John sees a white horse (verse 2) - an imitation of Jesus at His second coming described later in Rev. 19:11-16. Here are pictured FALSE CHRISTS - false preachers deceiving and causing multitudes to accept them as the ministers of righteousness (II Cor. 11:13-15), preaching counterfeit Christs (II Cor. 11:4) represented to be the true Christ who died for us on the Cross. The world is full of them, though deceived multitudes do not realize it!<br>  <br>  The second seal is opened (verse 3, and 4) and a red horse appears, killing men, taking peace from the earth - symbolizing WAR.<br>  <br>  The third seal (verses 5, 6) is a black horse, picturing FAMINE.<br>  <br>  The fourth seal (verses 7, 8) is a pale horse meaning PESTILENCE.<br>  <br>  The fifth seal (verses 9-11) depicts one phase of THE GREAT TRIBULATION - the martyrdom of saints. This shows the Tribulation occurred in the middle ages only as a type, or forerunner, for the martyrs of that time are told to wait until this endtime martyrdom.<br>  <br>  The sixth seal shows the heavenly signs - sun and moon becoming dark, and the stars falling. (Verses 12-13) Some claim this already has occurred, but the events they describe were mere LOCAL events, seen only in a small section of New England, and merely a forerunner and warning of the far more vast, awe-inspiring, terrible event here described as YET to come.<br>  <br>  It occurs AFTER the Tribulation. (See also Mat. 24:29) Furthermore this event is accompanied or immediately followed by the SIGN of the coming of Christ (Mat. 24:29-30) - which Rev. 6:14-17 shows is the heavens departing as a scroll rolled together - men hiding themselves in stark terror in the dens and mountains, crying for the rocks and mountains to fall on them and hide them from the face of Him who is sitting on the throne in heaven (compare Rev. 4:2, the scene where John, in vision, sees these seals being opened) - and from THE WRATH OF THE LORD, for THE GREAT DAY OF HIS WRATH IS COME! This (compare Zeph. 1:14-17) is "THE DAY OF THE LORD."<br>  <br>  The Tribulation and the Day of the Lord<br>  <br>  It is vital to understand the distinction between the Great Tribulation, and the Day of the Lord. The heavenly signs do not occur until AFTER the Tribulation. (Mat. 24:29) But they are to come BEFORE the "Day of the Lord" (Joel 2:31). The two are different and separate. 1st, Tribulation; 2nd, heavenly signs; 3rd, Day of the Lord, which, we shall see is the seventh seal.<br>  <br>  But just as we come to the time for the terrible DAY OF THE LORD to strike, an angel appears holding back the four winds, (Rev. 7:1-3) which are the first four Trumpet plagues (chpt. 8:7-12) of the Day of the Lord.<br>  <br>  They are held back until the 144,000 are sealed, and the great innumerable multitude of ALL NATIONS turn to God and His protection.<br>  <br>  The 144,000 are 12,000 from each of the literal tribes of Israel. (Rev. 7:4) They are sealed by the Holy Spirit. IN their foreheads, and it is THE FATHER'S NAME that is sealed there. (Rev. 14:1) The TIME of this sealing, then, is yet future - after the Tribulation, after the heavenly signs, after the SIGN of Christ's coming appears in heaven.<br>  <br>  The innumerable multitude shall have come out of THE great Tribulation (Rev. 7:14). God will not send His plagues without warning of such supernatural nature (the heavenly signs and the sign of the Son of Man) that all who are willing shall heed. Preaching and warnings now seem to fall on deaf ears. But when God sends these mighty supernatural signs, MEN WILL HEED and turn to Christ.<br>  <br>  Then comes the opening of THE SEVENTH SEAL, in the eighth chapter.<br>  <br>  And what IS the 7th seal? Remember, the seven seals covered the ENTIRE BOOK, so this seal covers the remainder of the prophecy. Under each seal John records what he SEES. What does he SEE, as this last seal is opened? (Rev. 8:1-2) He sees THE SEVEN TRUMPETS being handed to the seven angels.<br>  <br>  Here is the third VITAL KEY to this Book. The seven Trumpets are not, as many have been taught, contemporaneous with the seven seals. Neither do they follow the closing of the seventh seek They ARE, and CONSTITUTE, the seventh seal.<br>  <br>  The seventh seal comes in SEVEN STAGES, each called a Trumpet. These are PLAGUES. (chpt. 9:20) A trumpet is BLOWN. The first four Trumpet plagues are described as winds that BLOW on the earth, trees, rivers, sea. (Rev. 8:1-12) I do not, here, attempt to interpret the nature of these plagues - whether this language is to be taken literally or as symbols. But remember, if you attempt to interpret these things as symbols, you must find a BIBLE interpretation for each. A Trumpet also is a symbol of WAR, and the 5th and 6th Trumpets picture WAR - the two phases of the coming WORLD WAR III. The last three Trumpets - the 5th, 6th, and 7th, are called WOES. (Rev. 8:13).<br>  <br>  The Three Woes<br>  <br>  The first woe, or 5th Trumpet, is described in chapter 9, verses 1-11. The power that causes the destruction, this time to Men, comes out of the "bottomless pit." We know this is a symbol. The only place in Scripture where it is interpreted is Rev. 17:14. There we learn that the re-birth of the old ROMAN EMPIRE is the power that emerges out of "the bottomless pit." It is a war-making power (Rev. 9:7). Mussolini restored the pitifully-weak, insignificant SIXTH "head" of the "Beast" - the Roman Empire. A seventh and last revival is yet to come. Hitler started this - but failed to complete it.<br>  <br>  The second woe, with its symbols of horses and horsemen (compare Ezek. 38:4, 15) and (Joel 2:4) is described in the 13th-21st verses, chapter 9. Could this be the USSR destroying the coming Roman Catholic, Nazi-Fascist Europe called "The Beast" and "Babylon" in Rev. 17-18, also described in Isa. 47, 48:13-14, and in Jer. 50 and 51?<br>  <br>  And now notice that the TWO WITNESSES end their mission (chapter 11) at the END of the second Woe. (verses 12-14) They are killed by the "Beast" - re-born Roman Empire that comes out of the bottomless pit under the first woe - which places the time YET IN THE FUTURE, shattering some cherished man-made theories.<br>  <br>  Now comes the THIRD WOE, or 7th Trumpet. What is it? This is the last 7th part of the seventh seal, and remember the seven seals cover the ENTIRE PROPHECY!<br>  <br>  Notice Rev. 11:15-18. When the 7th Trumpet sounds, the nations are angry - in world war, again raging - and it is proclaimed "THY WRATH is come." The only thing here described that possibly could be this terrible woe is "Thy WRATH."<br>  <br>  And what is "THY WRATH"? According to Revelation 15:1, it is THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES! Just as the 7th seal is subdivided into the SEVEN TRUMPETS, so the 7th Trumpet is divided into the SEVEN LAST PLAGUES, which are and constitute the 7th Trumpet or third woe. Thus the 7 last plagues too, are part of the 7th seal. The second coming of Christ shall occur at the precise time of the seven last plagues. And so, as this 7th Trumpet is blown, the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of Christ, who then reigns. (11-15) So Christ comes at the LAST TRUMP. (I Cor. 15:52, I Thes. 4: 16).<br>  <br>  Chapter 12 is an inset chapter, injected into the main story-thread. Just as any writer will stop his narrative at a certain point, to go back and sketch a different scene involving different characters and events, bringing them up to, and connecting them with his story-thread at that juncture, so here John pictures the TRUE CHURCH, from the time prior to Christ's birth, (verse 4) thru His birth, resurrection and ascension, (verse 5) and the 1260 years of persecution when the TRUE CHURCH was forced to flee completely beyond the bounds of ROMAN dominion. The TRUE CHURCH has always existed.<br>  <br>  The church of chapter 17 is the great false church. Rev. 12 brings the story of the true church to the present, when the devil, knowing he has but a short time, (verse 12) persecutes the true Church pictured as a remnant or SMALL in number, and KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD. (verse 17) while the false Church and her daughters (Rev. 17:5) preach the Commandments are done away!<br>  <br>  The 13th chapter is another inset, picturing the symbolic "beast" and the second two-horned "beast." Chapter 14 shows the three angel Messages, proclaiming the fall, or DOOM, of "Babylon" thru the seven last Plagues; and the warning against the MARK OF THE BEAST, which those in "Babylon" are deceived into having.<br>  <br>  Chapters 15, 16 describe THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES, which are the third woe or seventh Trumpet. These are God's judgments against this false religious system, "Babylon" - (Rev. 18:4, 8-10).<br>  <br>  Chapters 17 and 18 picture the revived Roman Empire and the great FALSE CHURCH, with her DAUGHTER CHURCHES (17:5) deceiving all nations (17:2, 15 and 18:3).<br>  <br>  Israel is today IN BABYLON - deceived! (Jer. 50:4-8, 13-15, 51:6-9; Isa. 47:1, 5, 7-9, 11; 48:1, 12, 17-20) We are God's people, Israel - IN BABYLON today, as Israel was in Egypt when God's plagues were on Egypt! And God calls us OUT (Rev. 18:4) and tells us to keep His commandments!<br>  <br>  The 19th chapter shows the SECOND COMING OF CHRIST, and the 20th the THOUSAND YEAR REIGN ON EARTH (Rev. 5:10) - 21st and 22nd chapters the NEW HEAVEN AND THE NEW EARTH thru eternity.

RaXCko4saa	you can suggest having simultaneous interpreting during the meetings in order to preserve the national language and to let all the people understand each other. even the UN has 6 languages so, not only is the english accepted in this organization but also, 5 other languages.<br>  There are many countries that don't speak English and preserve their own language on their lands . in Spain,Turkey, France, Germany all these countries prefer their languages more than English. in the international conferences we find presidents who speak their own languages and use the head phones for translation. it's not a sham thing. <br>  the power of the person is not in his English but in his brain  his education and his behavior.

It does not have to be an actual room, but a place with no distractions, where you can open your Bible and get on your knees.  Read from Scripture and start praising and thanking the Lord.  The Holy Spirit will open the way for you to feel God's presence.  God bless.|`|AA11139575	Some people, even Christians have felt this way. Your problem may be that God is not real to you. Here are some suggestions:<br>  <br>  Regularly Study the Bible- the more you study God's word, the more real God will become to you- Ps. 1:1, 2; Joshua 1:8<br>  <br>  Pray Regularly and Fervently- Make your problem a matter of serious prayer-Luke 17:5. Study the examples in the Bible of people who prayed and the ways they did so-Jesus when approaching death, before selecting his apostles; Hannah when she was asking for a child.<br>  <br>  Observe Creation- Romans 1:20 points out that God's qualities are evident by looking at his creations. By carefully observing God's creations, his personality becomes more known to you and this will make him more real to you. <br>  <br>  Walk with God- imitate Bible examples such as Noah who walked with God. This means that he felt as if God was right by his side. You trust in what he says and even though you may not always understand things, when you experience his help and support, he will become real to you.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	You feel God by His GRACE. <br>  <br>  And "Jesuit" is catholic.  Catholicism is false.  Catholicism is not Christian, and catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that leads to eternal torment in hell (Galatians 1:6-9). <br>  <br>  So you'll NEVER feel God through catholicism. <br>  <br>  Jesus is God and Jesus wants a PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP with you.  Catholicism cannot give you that.  Catholicism cannot save you. <br>  <br>  Jesus loves you so very much!  :D<br>  <br>  Here's how to be saved, and feel God: <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|jAc7AgOiaa	You can't just pray and expect to feel God.<br>  Maybe you're not really opening your heart to him.<br>  You need to read his word (the Bible).|`|fe59898453c9fe7e6d2c637b92e81411aa	You're very lucky, now you can become an unbeliever, which is much more fun|`|ryOti9v0aa	No Worries...<br>  <br>  "He's" flaccid.

I.e. if you burn it, it's pretty likely someone in the world will die of burn wounds, and you'll feel like it's your fault, even though it's just chance.

Hell no, not even remotely close.<br>  <br>  Also 'white privelege' is mostly about sociological factors.

And on your actual birthday, just hang out with a close friend.  It will be memorable!|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Awesome, I will be 20 in September and I am looking forward to it too. (well, I don't wanna grow up, but that's a different story)<br>  <br>  In june, the weather should be absolutely awesome, so do something outdoorsy! Maybe you can rent a cottage near a lake and go for a couple days with close friends. Or you can rent a small villa and go somewhere near water. Because summer + water = best time ever. <br>  I am not from he UK, so I have no idea what places to suggest so I am just giving you descriptions. <br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is have a very formal tea party. Maybe you can use your house or someone else's or rent some place! You can figure that out...but get everyone to dress up. Since its summer gowns will be way too hot. So maybe flirty summer dresses and have tea. Invite a lot of people. It's like a step to woman hood.

Es posible sentirse como en una prisión, sin posibilidad de escapar, y eso es comprensible. <br>  No?obstante, tal actitud no?ayudará a solucionar los problemas derivados de la pobreza; al contrario, puede que una persona reaccione de manera que empeore.<br>  <br>  Cantidades alarmantes de jóvenes pobres tratan de evitar los sufrimientos de la pobreza embotando sus sentidos con el alcohol o las drogas. Según la investigadora Jill Swart, los ni?os callejeros de cierta ciudad del sur de áfrica “no?aspiran pegamento solo ‘por el placer que derivan’. Lo hacen para?[...] evadirse del frío, la soledad y el hambre”.<br>  <br>  Ahora bien, ?cómo se sienten cuando vuelven a la realidad una vez terminado su “viaje”? Jill Swart constató documentalmente la existencia de “depresión intensa”, “agresión”, “cambios bruscos y rápidos de humor”, “visión defectuosa” y un sinfín de otras dolencias físicas que difícilmente podrían catalogarse como una forma saludable de “evadirse” de la pobreza.<br>  <br>  La Biblia se?ala: “El borracho?[...] [vendrá] a parar en la pobreza, y el adormecimiento vestirá a uno de meros andrajos”. (Proverbios 23:21.) <br>  Tratar de evadir la realidad de la pobreza alterando el estado mental con alcohol, pegamento o drogas no?hará que desaparezca el problema. <br>  María, una muchacha de dieciséis a?os procedente de una familia monoparental y pobre de áfrica del Sur, dijo lo siguiente: “Intentar evadirse de la realidad causa más dificultades que las que soluciona”. Además, el elevado coste de mantener tales hábitos destructivos hunde a la persona aún más en la pobreza. <br>  La única forma de que un joven pobre pueda abrigar la esperanza de mejorar su situación es afrontándola con honradez.<br>  <br>  Airados por no?ver salida a su situación de indigencia, muchos jóvenes exteriorizan su furia mediante la violencia, el vandalismo, los robos y otras formas de delincuencia juvenil. <br>  The World Book Encyclopedia dice que tales jóvenes ven en esto la “única vía de escape del aburrimiento, la pobreza y otros problemas”. <br>  Hay quien llenos de ira y frustración, se unen a pandillas que siembran el terror en el vecindario. <br>   “pelean y roban sobre todo para subsistir”. <br>  También hay jóvenes que tratan de superar su pobreza enredándose en actividades lucrativas ilegales, como la de vender drogas o introducir a otros en su consumo.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, lejos de aliviar la pobreza, la conducta delincuente empeora las cosas. Solo sirve para desperdiciar la energía que podría haberse canalizado en actividades productivas, como aprender un oficio útil. <br>  En lugar de mejorar su situación, lo único que consigue el joven que se descarría es perjudicarse más en sentido físico y emocional. <br>  Algunos jóvenes hasta terminan en la cárcel o sufren una muerte violenta. <br>  <br>  Una de las peores secuelas que la pobreza puede dejar en un joven posiblemente sea un constante sentimiento de inutilidad e inferioridad. <br>  En el caso de muchos, la absoluta pobreza que se observa en todos los campos de la vida ha eliminado todo resquicio de esperanza de que algún día mejore su nivel de vida. <br>  The World Book Encyclopedia indica que los jóvenes muchas veces “adquieren los mismos sentimientos de impotencia y desesperación de sus padres”. <br>  Con el tiempo puede surgir una “cultura de la pobreza”, de modo que sus víctimas se resignan a vivir en la miseria por el resto de su vida.<br>  <br>  Ahora bien, ?Cómo utilizar entonces el libre albedrío ante esa situación? <br>  Optar por decisiones negativas lo único que consigue con ello es perpetuar el círculo vicioso de la pobreza. <br>  <br>  Un antiguo proverbio expresó esta idea como sigue: “El que está vigilando el viento no?sembrará; y el que está mirando las nubes no?segará”. (Eclesiastés 11:4.)<br>  Si un agricultor solo se centrase en las posibilidades negativas —el viento que podría llevarse la semilla o la lluvia que podría mojar la cosecha—, no?haría nada. <br>  De manera similar, solo centrarse en los sentimientos negativos, puede paralizar cualquier esfuerzo por mejorar la situación.<br>  <br>  De ahí que algo positivo es: “Por la ma?ana siembra tu semilla, y hasta el atardecer no?dejes descansar la mano; pues no?sabes dónde tendrá éxito esto”. (Eclesiastés 11:6.) <br>  <br>  Sí, en lugar de quedarse parado por temor al fracaso o por pensar que una situación es desesperada, ?haz algo! Hay cosas que puedes hacer para ir reemplazando poco a poco actitudes negativas por otras positivas.<br>  <br>  ?Cómo cuáles?<br>  1).- Cultiva amor propio<br>  2).- Haste diestro en cualquier actividad que haya que realizar. Se obtiene un sentimiento de logro.<br>  3).- Siempre hay la posibilidad de aprender algo nuevo. Aprovechar el tiempo.<br>  4).- Usar las energías en ayudar a alguien. Se obtiene felicidad de compartir lo que todos tenemos. ?Sentimientos!<br>  5).- Si ya se sabe algo, ense?ar a quienes no lo saben es una manera de ser útil.<br>  6).- Cultivar una buena espiritualidad. No se trata de credulidad, (lo que algunos llaman erróneamente fe). Es analizar y meditar en lo que sí tienes. Ser agradecido.<br>  <br>  No es fácil criarse en la indigencia, pero no?hay razón para sentir vergüenza, impotencia o desesperación. <br>  La pobreza existe porque “el hombre ha dominado al hombre para perjuicio suyo”. dice la Biblia en (Eclesiastés 8:9.) <br>  Las se?ales indican que Dios pronto asumirá el control de los asuntos terrestres y eliminará la pobreza y sus devastadores efectos. (Salmo 37:9-11.) <br>  <br>  Su Hijo Cristo Jesús hará que miles de millones de personas gocen del paraíso terrestre que prometió al acongojado malhechor que expresó fe en él mientras ambos morían en los maderos de ejecución. (Lucas 23:43.) <br>  <br>  No?obstante, se pueden hacer muchas cosas mientras tanto para enfrentarse a la pobreza de una manera práctica. <br>  <br>  Sí.

0d5edff6ca86151fdb18b82dadc968a0aa	Bom, eu concordo que a polêmica é interessante porque gera discuss?o e traz à tona uma diversidade de opini?es que terminam por enriquecer o debate. Muitas vezes vemos pessoas que acusam outros de "radicalismo" justo quando lhes interessa que determinado assunto n?o seja discutido. Por que isso? Por que têm medo de opini?es? Ora se estamos numa sociedade democrática deveríamos estar dispostos a discutir qualquer assunto, por mais nevrálgico que este possa parecer. Parece ser interessante para alguns contudo- principalmente quando se está no conforto da situa??o do poder-  controlar os mecanismos de express?o exatamente porque temem "ser incomodados" pela voz dissidente que n?o se intimida em questionar. E é óbvio que temos também muitos hipócritas de plant?o que embora repitam como papagaios que s?o "contra todo tipo de censura" insistem em reproduzir nos espa?os abertos a tirania totalitarista que lhes contamina a alma; estes s?o geralmente os que se apressam em dizer a outros o que pode ou n?o pode ser discutido e s?o justo os que fogem dos debates ou d?o respostas evasivas do tipo "N?o sei, n?o sabia", isso quando n?o respondem a uma simples pergunta atacando ou acusando. <br>  <br>  Abra?o e tudo de bom,<br>  <br>  <br>  Clayton.<br>  <br>  PS.: e acredito que esses "inteligentes" n?o compreendam mesmo o sentido do têrmo "radical", evidentemente usam-no no sentido de designar "extremismo" ou "fundamentalismo"; mas a palavra "radical" faz men??o a um esfor?o em buscar respostas em profundidade; "radicalidade" seria o significado mais puro de algo em quest?o.|`|1d3b27dd26b77a993a4a2a635dde80cbaa	Isso é porque eles aplicam em outros o que eles s?o, isso em psicologia se chama Proje??o : projetar no outro o que acontece com ele.<br>  <br>  JK|`|ZKOKkAdRaa	Vá à luta meu filho.<br>  Questione, pergunte, discorde, intime.<br>  Escreva sua vida!|`|a5d445a3dab67e38711976f94a514a79aa	Prefiro ser um radical, que um passivo e acomodado, é da mesma maneira que acontece no palácio do planalto, lá eles s?o apenas CORRUPTOS, quem pega no supermercado uma latinha de leite para um filho é ladr?o, será julgado e condenado, o filho que se dane, deixa eu ser radical mesmo!!!|`|bdd5826a6800474ffdac98e299408f6aaa	Eu particularmente adoro polêmicas, visto que toda unanimidade é "burra"<br>  <br>  <br>  Bjs|`|cffd6fffee8089c8038f06a1149ba64faa	A  "inteligentsia" está aguardando <br>  a sua pergunta polêmica , com ansiedade !<br>  <br>  Sou radical moderada.<br>  :)|`|051411ba5c123ac511d60f320b7874acaa	é que tem gente que descorda só por prazer, e n?o para resolver duvidas.|`|2367d1a037cf2a7e412ebd00f0bf7252aa	Porque tais pessoas s?o os psedo inteligentes, aqueles que acham que sabem mais que todos e n?o sabem nada.

We went out for ages and stopped to have something to eat . When we came to set off he said which way should we go ? I said towards a big rock that we had spotted as a landmark but he said nooooooo it was on the other side [boat had spun round] so he set off opposite to land we could see . We really were far out !!! We started to panic a bit and as we came nearer land spotted a beach bar so he said that he would ask !!! He asked people that was having a drink [us still on the chuggy boat ] where Friskaro was and they all laughed and said up that way but on Kefolonia we were on the sister island Ithaca .

0a8a6705c38f3c2d79ea2d530ad6b705aa	Opino que es una interpretación muy sui generis de las Escrituras.<br>  El caso es que Adán y Eva representan en la narración del Génesis al ser humano -hombre y mujer- que rechazan las propuestas de Dios y que por tal motivo se auto-excluyen de sus beneficios. Tal es el concepto de "la caída" en la doctrina católica.<br>  Desde una apreciación muy personal, no veo nada de glorioso que el ser humano posea y ejercite su tendencia a rechazar el bien y adherirse al mal, rechazar lo que le conviene y adherirse a lo que le hace da?o, rechazar a Dios y elegirse a sí mismo sobre Dios.<br>  Por ello, es que se me hace incomprensible que se justifique y alabe esta tendencia y se la califique de necesaria y honorable, sobre todo, refiriéndolo al "plan de Dios" .<br>  Sobre el plan de Dios puede decirse que conduce única y exclusivamente a nuestra salvación, lo que fuera de eso hagamos los seres humanos, es nuestra elección.<br>  Saludos,<br>  Totús|`|80344986eddffa1c55cfb44562db205faa	Que la verdad quien sabe quien la tenga|`|a518f614b3ae2b03e9d191fe5fd396a2aa	Que en el tema de las creencias la verdad la "tiene" aquel que tenga la ocurrencia más contundente...|`|becf133e3b7cb773a91df0419667d397aa	no lo sabia<br>  Su verdadero nombre es: " La Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los Ultimos Días".<br>  <br>  Revelaciones<br>  <br>  Este movimiento religioso fue fundado por José Smith, que nació el a?o 1805 en Sharon, Vermont, E.U. A.<br>  <br>  Desde la ni?ez fue muy piadoso, sin pertenecer a ninguna religión, y tenía escasa salud. El mismo cuenta que a los 15 a?os tuvo su primera revelación.

You are always free to sleep with whomever. The difference of the free love era of the 1970's is that the free love part came in response to youth shaking off the traditional values taught to them by the older generation, including but not exclusive to, sexual values. The trend now is still towards extramarital or premarital sexual activity, but is shadowed and in large part defined by the harbinger of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD's), which, while perhaps not limiting the amount of sex, impacts the variety of partners the smart modern sexually active adult chooses.|`|b310b8570493dc70140c4a3cf93ff59baa	it was the 60's and we were all on acid trips|`|1186dcf9b910880f9b935d2af4109509aa	I was there.<br>  <br>  It has helped ruin the moral value of North America.<br>  <br>  We were allsold a bill of goods.  The result of CIA introduced sickenesses like feminism and Playboyism.  We were told this was "freedom".  However, rather than get political, I will cut and paste part of a recent story I wrote.  The story is called "Your Fingers"<br>  <br>  "It was so much easier in the 60’s.  I wasn’t obsessed with checking out hands and fingers and trying to mentally place them on my crotch.  Back then, everyone sort of melted into everyone else, and there was no threat of herpes, pregnancy or AIDS.  Herpes was not even considered.  We all took the pill.  HIV was unknown.  We did it everywhere in every imaginable position.  Oral sex, gentle sex, harsh sex, yogic sex.  Hammocks, floors, bathtubs, indoors, outdoors!  I loved all of it.  The kissing and touching, sucking and f**king, and I never demanded anything, but did everything possible, lost in a decade of dope and sticky bed sheets for hours, days at a time.  The person I was then really did love it and walked around all day with a buzz in her crotch for any guy who had played games with her.  Finger-f**king was only something bad girls did on the way up to losing their virginity.  It was not the prize at the end of the day.  What I want now is the good old-fashioned lying in the back seat of his parent’s car, crotches touching, hands everywhere, soft and stroking, just learning how to touch and please.  All that adolescence, innocence, and steamy windows.   I don’t want to grow old.  I don’t want to die.  I want to get fingered and f**ked with innocence and lust. How many fingers could I take comfortably?<br>  <br>  Did you, dear lover, ever go to orgies in the 60’s?  Or were you just on the fringe, interested but afraid of losing yourself in the spiral of sex and drugs that enticed so many?  Ok, so I have to accept the present and stop living in the sexual past.  I am 50, with two almost grown-up daughters and I cannot stop the aging process.  I know that.  What I do not want to know is that I am sagging, have crow’s feet around my eyes, sometimes look haggard, and probably should reconsider hormone replacement therapy."<br>  <br>  Such looseness of behaviour loosed a myriad of evils on the world.  Illnesses and loss of respect for the act of love.  What should be sublime is now no more than mutual masturbation.<br>  <br>  I would like to think it has changed but, to be honest, I don't see it.  Too many young people are doing what should have been saved for marriage.  Nothing is sacred.|`|2208c2dae4b48648f8b95f21a760a999aa	Actually it did start in the late 60s around the time our guys started coming home from Viet-Nam. Girls who had boyfriends before the war had no one come home or the ones that came back were really screwed up. It was the introduction of drugs, sex and rock  n roll to us, the kids, of total escapism, between pot, psychedelics, and sex we didn't have to think about the controversies, and I'm not talking about the war only. The controversies were our parents trying to rescue us from the return trying to force religion on us and putting down the guys we loved as baby killers etc. It was a time of rebellion from hell. We rebelled against everything,including clothes. There probably wasn't all that more sex, we just quit hiding to have it. The shock value was .....priceless...... You have to remember too that this is the only time that there was a draft and no thank yous when they returned. They were leaving at 18 with less than no guarantees, We couldn't let them leave VIRGINS.|`|G2OWryLfaa	america reached its promiscuous pinnacle and then aids was implemented by our government

Arjuna came moments later,being a devotee he stood facing the lotus feet of lord with his head bowed and hands folded. When lord Krishna opened his eyes he saw Arjuna first so he asked Arjuna for the purpose of his visit. Duryodhana thought that Arjuna might grab the opportunity and ask for Krishna's assistance in the war. so he said that he had come first and he wants to say his thing first .Lord Krishna agreed and said that since I cant deny my help to anyone of you you may choose between the two- me alone and without weapons or my entire army. Lord's army was very big and powerful. Duryodhana was ignorant so he felt very happy that he could voice his demand first.he asked for the army. Arjuna was happy asking for Lord Krishna alone. But the foolish and sinful Duryodhana didnt know that he had made a wrong choice.<br>  so, Lord Krishna became Arjuna's charioteer when Arjuna pleaded that he wanted his friend and lord by his side throughout the battle.there was no trickery in Arjuna's heart.|`|biFCKGAcaa	Shri Krishna played an interesting role in the war. Both Duryodhana and Arjuna went to meet Shri Krishna for his assistance in the war. Both reached his palace early morning and waited for Shri Krishna to wake up. Proudly, Duryodhana sat near his head while Arjuna sat humbly at his feet. When Shri Krishna woke up he first saw Arjuna and asked what he wanted. Thus the discussion started. Shri Krishna said that he himself would support one side and lend his army to the other. He also said that he would not handle any arms during the war. Duryodhana opted for the army while Arjuna opted for Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna acted as Arjuna's charioteer during the war and saved him from death many times. He was intelligent and shrewd and it is this shrewdness which mainly made Pandavas win the war. Bhishma. Dronacharya fought on Kauravas side as their duty but their heart was with Arjuna and Yudhishtir. However they did not become lax in their duties.

dc8dfe605c4f905286d2b5d2538cee53aa	here is another version of this verse<br>  <br>  " 9Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak."<br>  <br>  i'm not sure if this helps, but I would suggest you read the whole chapter and put this verse into context.|`|EEi543PGaa	It means that the people who had been taught by Christ Jesus, were in the "know" as it were, that the foods which the nations thought of as "belonging" to the gods... weren't foods that were really to be kept for those gods and they knew that it was okay for them to eat such foods. However, many were babes in the truth and would get "stumbled" by seeing the disciples and or older "Christians", who were supposedly more "mature" and who should have known better! and the "babes" would get offended in watching the older ones eating freely of the foods which were thought for so lone to be foods reserved for the gods... The truth that sets us all free to not celebrate worldly festivities, pagan traditions, etc., which allows us to eat pork, bacon, sea food, etc. can sometimes stumble others who are still stuck in their old traditions; and until such time as they were all mature enough to understand the more solid foods of the Scriptures or teachings of Christ, Paul admonishes the early Christians to abstain from doing anything that might stumble or become a stumbling block to the newer ones... I hope that this will help you with the above Scripture!|`|QYodaS9Qaa	In Corinth, all meat was sold at the butcher shops connected to the pagan temples.  Many Corinthian Christians believed that to purchase and consume this meat was the same as worshiping said idol and so maintained that Christians in such places should not eat meat.  Paul in previous verses says that God made this meat and if you pray over it, you can eat it in Jesus' Name. However, if a weak person still thinks about the idol when eating the meat, they should not eat it as it would be sin for them.  We would not invite these people to a barbecue and argue with them because their soul is more important than our being right.|`|ef7b5627ea09eab595bfe61385dabaefaa	This was an excellent question that you posed here. I have read this scripture over many times and never stopped to think about what “this liberty” meant. In my copy of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, it says “this authority.” After digging for the answer to this question, here was what I pulled up.<br>  <br>  Understand that this account in 1 Corinthians 8 was regarding food what was sacrificed to idols. However, not all of the meat of animals sacrificed to idols was used in the sacred feasts, but much of it found its way into the shambles or pagan meat markets. It was such meat that 1 Corinthians 8:1-10 allows Christians to buy and eat. Whatever meat was sold in these meat markets, even though the blood of the animal or part of its flesh had been used in idol worship by idol worshipers, could be eaten by Christians. It was not eaten as a part of a sacred feast in honor of an idol.<br>  <br>  One of the main characters in this account was of the apostle Paul, who had a fine missionary spirit. For instance, he did not want to be responsible for obstacles that might prevent Jews and Gentiles from accepting the truth. Therefore, the apostle was careful about what he ate and admonished Corinthian Christians to watch that “exercising their right” (or their liberty) to eat certain foods did not stumble others. (1 Corinthians 8:8, 9) <br>  <br>  Yet on one point the Christian was to be careful: he was not to stumble a weaker brother. If one not fully mature in knowledge and understanding on this matter objected to a mature brother’s eating the meat, the mature brother would not eat. While free to do so, he would not allow his freedom to be the cause of a weaker one’s judging him adversely. He would refrain from eating rather than stumble his weaker brother. (1 Corinthians 8:11-13; 10:23-33, New World Translation)<br>  <br>  In the New Century Bible, Professor F. F. Bruce stated: “In all indifferent things (such as the food which was at issue in [1 Corinthians] chapter 8), [Paul] conforms to the customs of those with whom he is at the time, so as to put no obstacle in the way of ‘winning’ them for the gospel.” (Romans 14:21)<br>  <br>  I hope that this explanation helped in the answer that you are looking for in regards to 1 Corinthians 8:9.<br>  <br>  Thanks,|`|yPTk40uGaa	we have the librety to do whatever we wish, wherether it coincides with gods laws or not. therefore if out of your librety you violate gods law then other will soon follow and thus you have created a stumbling block for men. it warns christians to watch what they do for they should reflect christ in their everyday life|`|AA12203324	Paul is saying that not every Christian is on the same page, so avoid doing things that look bad even if they aren't.  The "liberty" is the result of knowing what is important to God and, especially, what is not.<br>  <br>  Eating meat that had been offered to idols was considered an act of worship in the Roman faith.  Paul said God doesn't care what Christians eat, since the gods are not real, so Christians don't need to worry about condemnation because of inadvertently eating "unclean" food.  However, if the food has clearly been offered to an idol, the Christian might consider avoiding it if it gives the impression to other Chrisitians that he is actually participating in a pagan rite.  <br>  <br>  The problem is called "Scandal of the Innocent", and it can be applied to any situation which, while morally insignificant, can lead to confusion and doubt among those who might misunderstand what is really happening.  The Christian is advised to prudently avoid giving scandal, even if it is only imagined.|`|231296b9ebdeed24570b8ca6978948c0aa	It's stating that Christians may eat food offered to idols.

At the time, there were many restrictions on what to eat and how to eat it.<br>  He warns in this verse, that even though you can now eat anything (this liberty), you should be careful that if you happen to be eating something that is still considered taboo or unnatural to someone who is with you, that you should probably just refrain from it, because you don't want to cause that person to either berate you or fall into sin. <br>  <br>  blessings :)|`|AA11395278	see the previous verses for your answer.|`|ec02b3b2ac0531db23e2884c415edc09aa	This liberty of yours means<br>  a grant, allowance, authority, power, privilege, right, liberty.

AA12275506	God's holy spirit is not a person. It is his active force that can influence a person to do what's right in God's eyes.|`|7G4475MQaa	THE Bible's use of "holy spirit" indicates that it is a controlled force that Jehovah God uses to accomplish a variety of his purposes. To a certain extent, it can be likened to electricity, a force that can be adapted to perform a great variety of operations. <br>  <br>  At Genesis 1:2 the Bible states that "God's active force ["spirit" (Hebrew, ru'ach)] was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters." Here, God's spirit was his active force working to shape the earth. <br>  <br>  God uses his spirit to enlighten those who serve him. David prayed: "Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your spirit [ru'ach] is good; may it lead me in the land of uprightness." (Psalm 143:10) When 70 capable men were appointed to help Moses, God said to him: "I shall have to take away some of the spirit [ru'ach] that is upon you and place it upon them."—Numbers 11:17. <br>  <br>  Bible prophecy was recorded when men of God were "borne along by holy spirit [Greek, from pneu'ma]." (2 Peter 1:20, 21) In this way the Bible was "inspired of God," the Greek word for which is The·o'pneu·stos, meaning "God-breathed." (2 Timothy 3:16) And holy spirit guided certain people to see visions or to have prophetic dreams.—2 Samuel 23:2; Joel 2:28, 29; Luke 1:67; Acts 1:16; 2:32, 33. <br>  <br>  The holy spirit impelled Jesus to go into the wilderness after his baptism. (Mark 1:12) The spirit was like a fire within God's servants, causing them to be energized by that force. And it enabled them to speak out boldly and courageously.—Micah 3:8; Acts 7:55-60; 18:25; Romans 12:11; 1 Thessalonians 5:19. <br>  <br>  By his spirit, God carries out his judgments on men and nations. (Isaiah 30:27, 28; 59:18, 19) And God's spirit can reach everywhere, acting for people or against them.—Psalm 139:7-12. <br>  <br>  GOD'S spirit can also supply "power beyond what is normal" to those who serve him. (2 Corinthians 4:7) This enables them to endure trials of faith or to do things they could not otherwise do. <br>  <br>  For example, regarding Samson, Judges 14:6 relates: "The spirit of Yahweh seized on him, and though he had no weapon in his hand he tore the lion in pieces." (JB) Did a divine person actually enter or seize Samson, manipulating his body to do what he did? No, it was really "the power of the LORD [that] made Samson strong."—TEV. <br>  <br>  "On the whole, the New Testament, like the Old, speaks of the spirit as a divine energy or power." —A Catholic Dictionary<br>   <br>  <br>  The Bible says that when Jesus was baptized, holy spirit came down upon him appearing like a dove, not like a human form. (Mark 1:10) This active force of God enabled Jesus to heal the sick and raise the dead. As Luke 5:17 says: "The Power of the Lord [God] was behind his [Jesus'] works of healing."—JB. <br>  <br>  God's spirit also empowered the disciples of Jesus to do miraculous things. Acts 2:1-4 relates that the disciples were assembled together at Pentecost when "suddenly there occurred from heaven a noise just like that of a rushing stiff breeze, . . . and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues, just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance." <br>  <br>  So the holy spirit gave Jesus and other servants of God the power to do what humans ordinarily could not do. <br>  <br>   <br>  God’s All-Reaching Holy SpiritWhile the Bible always refers to God as having a specific dwelling place, it often speaks of his holy spirit in ubiquitous terms. “Where can I go from your spirit, and where can I run away from your face?” asked the psalmist David. (Psalm 139:7) Some have been confused by such references and may conclude that God is omnipresent. Yet, when considering the context of this and other texts, it becomes clear that Jehovah’s holy spirit—or power in action—can be extended from his fixed location to any place in the material universe.<br>  <br>  Like a father’s hand extending down to console and support his children, Jehovah’s hand—or holy spirit—can extend to any part of the spiritual realm or the physical universe to accomplish Jehovah’s purpose. Hence, the psalmist could say: “Were I to take the wings of the dawn, that I might reside there in the most remote sea, there, also, your own hand would lead me and your right hand would lay hold of me.”—Psalm 139:9, 10.<br>  <br>  Copyright ? 2006 Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.

No se olviden que al meter el miedo de que los ni?os no bautizados fueran al infierno (segun San Agustin) o al limbo, se pudo decir luego que ''todos eran catolicos romanos), por el solo hecho de ser bautizados; Ha sido la imposicion de la religion por el terror. Tampoco se puede seguir con la discriminacion, pues al considerar a los ni?os y a los aborigenes no como personas (lean la historia),  estos no merecian ir al cielo. Y me pregunto que si no ha sido dogma, entonces porque lo han sostenido y ense?ado durante tantisimos a?os, lo mismo que muchas otras mentiras que todavia sostienen.|`|KvXhUJnraa	Sí tiene el poder como se menciona en  Mateo 16:18-19.<br>  <br>  Yo me siento muy contento, porque refleja que el Papa Benedicto XVI no será opacado por el inmenso recuerdo y obra de Juan Pablo Segundo.

Ciertamente el purgatorio es uno de esas ideas que por el tiempo en que surgió, y otras situaciones que la acompa?aron, se perpetuo con el tiempo. Es un sitio relativamente nuevo a comparación de otros sitios como el Jardín del Edén.<br>  <br>  En el aspecto religioso, no podemos probar sin lugar a dudas que otros lugares como el Infierno existen, o que el Valhala es un mito, ya que nunca hemos regresado de la muerte para hacer una crónica del lugar a donde vamos. Claro, a menos que tomes la Biblia de manera literal, en cuyo caso no hay nada que discutirte.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, la creación de Purgatorio parece a simple vista -como tu lo mencionas- un acto de intransigencia y exceso de poder por parte de la Iglesia de Roma en la Edad Media. Muchas de las propiedades que la Iglesia Católica posee hoy se deben a las herencias que recibió durante este tiempo, puesto que la gente quería evitar su paso por el purgatorio al morir, o mas frecuentemente, acortar su estancia en un lugar del que no se había hablado en la Antigüedad. <br>  <br>  Estoy, parcialmente de acuerdo con eso, por muchas razones fue un modo muy simple de venderle a las personas miedo por el sufrimiento que les aguardaba después de la muerte, y fue tan efectivo que terminaron con riquezas y poder político que aun hoy no tiene fin.<br>  <br>  Ahora, lo mismo se puede decir de otras Iglesias Cristianas contemporáneas que venden entradas al paraíso haciendo donaciones al templo, y mas adecuadamente, a la cuenta bancaria del Pastor/Ministro/Hermano. Interesantes modelos de vida para toda la gente que profesa la filosofía de un hombre que entro a Jerusalén montado en un asno eh?<br>  <br>  También es importante considerar el conflicto intelectual y teológico del siglo XI y XII en Europa, como causas directas de la creación del Purgatorio. No es solamente una alternativa muy rentable para percibir donaciones, palacios, e influencia política, también es parte de una conclusión teológica, cuando en las universidad medievales la gente no podía ponerse de acuerdo con la división exacta entre el Paraíso y el infierno. <br>  <br>  El hecho de que sea un concepto relativamente moderno, no quiere decir que no sirva un propósito relativamente espiritual también. Si la gente no lo considerara así, no habrían respondido tan "generosamente" con donaciones invaluables al Papa, ni se habrían ido a matar Musulmanes como deporte cada temporada. <br>  <br>  Si las religiones no tuvieran lugares con nombres propios y descripciones de como es la existencia ahí, como el Jardín del Edén, el Infierno, la Tierra Prometida, o lo que quieras, seria difícil que la gente se identificara con lo que las religiones profesan. A pesar de la falta de evidencia o de testigos oculares de la existencia del Paraíso, los devotos de muchas religiones creen en el, y muchos saben exactamente que es lo que esperan encontrar ahí, y como llegar. Lo mismo puede decirse de cualquier otro sitio donde las almas pueden ir a morar después de la muerte.|`|bfc48b2da04fe91c34e2547b91635345aa	la iglesia no crea ni destruye lugares físicos.<br>  lo que sucede es que teologicamnete hablando, cuando define ciertas ense?anzas, tiene que hablar de lugares, analogicamente hablando., en relación a la presencia o no de/con dios.<br>  así hace con el cielo / infierno, etc.|`|uzyCxhxVaa	La Iglesia nunca habia afirmado la existencia del limbo, era solo una creencia.

3951990bf13287a0922b5df2ac3453b1aa	Livre-arbítrio quer dizer livre escolha, livre op??o. <br>   Em todas as situa??es da vida, sempre temos duas ou mais  possibilidades  para   escolher. <br>   E a cada momento a vida nos exige decis?o. Sempre temos que optar entre uma ou outra atitude. <br>   Desde que abrimos os olhos, pela manh?, estamos optando entre uma atitude ou outra. Ao ouvir o despertador, podemos escolher entre abrir a boca para lamentar por n?o ser nosso dia de folga ou para agradecer a Deus por mais um dia de oportunidades, no corpo físico. <br>   Ao encontrarmos o nosso familiar que acaba de se levantar, podemos resmungar qualquer coisa, ficar calado, ou desejar, do fundo da alma, um bom dia. <br>   Quando chegamos ao local de trabalho, podemos optar entre ficar de bem com todos ou buscar o isolamento, ou, ainda, contaminar o ambiente com mau humor. <br>   Conta um médico, que trata de pacientes com cancer, que as atitudes das pessoas variam muito, mesmo em situa??es parecidas. <br>   Diz ele que duas de suas pacientes, quase da mesma idade, tiveram que extirpar um seio por causa da doen?a. Uma delas ficou feliz por continuar viva e poder brincar com os netos, a outra optou por lamentar pelo seio que havia perdido, embora também tivesse os netos para se distrair. <br>   Quando alguém o ofende, você pode escolher por revidar, calar-se ou oferecer o tratamento oposto. A decis?o sempre é sua. <br>   O que vale ressaltar é que todas as a??es ter?o uma rea??o correspondente, como conseqüência. E essa a??o é de nossa total responsabilidade. <br>   E isso deve ser ensinado aos filhos desde cedo. Caso a crian?a escolha agredir seu colega e leve alguns arranh?es, deverá saber que isso é resultado da sua a??o e, por conseguinte, de sua inteira responsabilidade. <br>   Tudo na vida está sujeito à lei de causa e efeito: para uma a??o positiva, um efeito positivo; para uma a??o infeliz, o resultado correspondente. <br>   Se você chega ao trabalho bem humorado, alegre, radiante, e encontra seu colega de mau humor, você pode decidir entre sintonizar na faixa dele ou fazer com que ele sintonize na sua. <br>   Você tem ainda outra possibilidade de escolha: ficar na sua. <br>   Todavia, da sua escolha dependerá o resto do dia. E os resultados lhe pertencem. <br>   Jesus ensinou que a semeadura é livre, mas a colheita é obrigatória. <br>   Pois bem, nós estamos semeando e colhendo o tempo todo. Se semeamos sementes de flores, colhemos flores; se plantamos espinheiros, colheremos espinhos. N?o há outra saída. <br>   Mas o que importa mesmo é saber que a op??o é nossa. Somos livres para escolher, antes de semear. Aí é que está a justi?a divina. <br>   Mesmo as semeaduras que demoram bastante tempo para germinar, um dia ter?o seus frutos. S?o aqueles atos praticados no anonimato, na surdina, que aparentemente ficam impunes. Um dia eles aparecer?o e reclamar?o colheita. <br>   Igualmente, os atos de renúncia, de tolerancia, de benevolência, que tantas vezes parecem n?o dar resultados, um dia florescer?o e dar?o bons frutos e perfume agradável. é só deixar nas m?os do jardineiro divino, a quem chamamos de Criador. <br>   Pense nisso! <br>   A hora seguinte será o reflexo da hora atual. <br>   O dia de amanh? trará os resultados do dia de hoje. <br>   é assim que vamos construindo a nossa felicidade ou a nossa desdita, de acordo  com a nossa livre escolha, com nosso livre-arbítrio.|`|00fcb4e8f5e848d2e17d2395340b1976aa	Olá PC,<br>  <br>  Livre árbitrio é a condi??o que possuem todos os seres humanos de escolher o que querem fazer de sua vida .<br>  Um grande abr?o!.|`|0cd036ca98835561a3239e330943db7caa	O livre arbítrio, segundo a bíblia, é um direto que Deus concedeu aos homens, para terem pleno direito de decidir o que queiram.Assim sendo,todo homem tem o direito de decidir ou n?o ser um seguidor de Cristo, de fazer isso ou aquilo, ou de resusar-se a fazer.

Do vício para a virtude. Do tormento para a suavidade.<br>  A dificuldade da reden??o está no fato de que as sensa??es ligadas à matéria e ao momento que passa produzem prazeres imediatos, enquanto que as alegrias espirituais - conquanto incomparavelmente mais grandiosas - têm que ser cultivadas paciente e heroicamente nos embates do dia a dia.<br>  Infelizmente, vivemos num meio cultural em que tudo parece empurrar-nos, desde a infancia, rumo às atitudes do egoísmo individual e grupal, bem como ao imediatismo do aqui e agora. Quase toda a educa??o consiste em dotar os novos indivíduos para sobreviver e prosperar por si mesmos, tanto quanto possível, dentro de um entendimento pobre do que sejam sobrevivência e prosperidade.<br>  Ao mesmo tempo, o espírito de grei como que aprisiona o ser ao estreito círculo familiar, primeiro ao de sua origem filial, depois ao da família que ele constitui e entende ser do seu dever preservar e projetar o mais longe e alto possível, ainda que à custa de elementares princípios de fraternidade e de solidariedade humanas.<br>  O homem deveria compreender, no entanto, que, peregrinando por este mundo expiatório, n?o ser?o somente a comodidade e o contentamento imediatos, nem a proje??o social, própria e do círculo de parentesco, que lhe garantir?o a felicidade real, mas, ao contrário, quanto mais tenha feito em prol da autodisciplina e do bem dos semelhantes, independentemente de consangüinidade e de interesses outros, é que mais garantirá ventura inalterável.<br>  A propósito dessa eterna disputa entre o material e o espiritual, o imediato e o remoto, vejamos um apólogo lá das terras do oriente, captado por Malba Tahan e constante do seu livro "Lendas do Céu e da Terra", sob o título "Os três amigos do homem":<br>  "Era uma vez um homem que tinha três amigos. A todos dedicava grande interesse e n?o os esquecia um só momento.<br>  Um dia o homem foi chamado a comparecer ao Tribunal, perante o Grande Juiz.<br>  Assustado, na incerteza do que poderia acontecer, procurou o primeiro amigo e pediu-lhe auxílio.<br>  - Nada posso fazer em teu favor - respondeu o primeiro amigo. Pagarei, apenas, as despesas de tua viagem!<br>  O homem recorreu ao segundo. Este lhe disse:<br>  _ Tenho muito medo desse Juiz que vai decidir sobre teu destino. Só posso levar-te, meu caro, até a porta do Tribunal.<br>  Diante do embara?o em que se achava, apelou o homem para o último amigo que lhe restava. <br>  O terceiro amigo atendeu, sem hesitar, ao pedido do homem: acompanhou-o até a presen?a do Juiz e esfor?ou-se, com dedica??o e carinho, pela sua absolvi??o.<br>  Sabem quais s?o os três amigos do homem?<br>  O primeiro é o Dinheiro: o segundo, a Família e o terceiro, as Boas A??es.<br>  Quando o homem morre e é levado ao Tribunal de Deus, o Dinheiro n?o o acompanha, apenas pode custear-lhe um féretro mais ou menos pomposo; a Família, compungida, vai levá-lo até o cemitério, passando a olvidar-lhe a memória desde o retorno.

Na Fran?a, apesar de "igualdade" estar entre os lemas da Revolu??o Francesa, a mulher só conseguiu votar a partir de 1945, após o fim da Segunda Guerra Mundial.No Brasil, essa conquista aconteceu em 1932, durante o governo de Getúlio Vargas.<br>  <br>  Abra?os|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	N?o sei mas coloca no google ou no yahoo que vc terá a resposta.<br>  Só acho um absurdo o voto no Brasil ser obrigatório ...que coisa mais antiga...vota quem quer ué.

Pois é, conforme o povo vai evoluindo, mesmo na ignorancia, suas experiências de outras vidas já n?o o fazem aceitar certas coisas.  Assim será com a Igreja Protestante.  Um dia cairá no ridículo.|`|23b65ff5ee7f42cdb53d7c3ce336b5e9aa	cada um com seu cada um|`|2bf03c200973fc356220d12c304d9e95aa	E é verdade mesmo, religi?o é cultura. Veja so se voce tivesse que cultuar o budismo oriental ou n?o comer carne por voce ser Hindú, vou viver a vida inteira casada com um cachorro, dsó porque voce na tua religi?o acredita-se que a pessoa que voce teria que casar a alma dele encarnou num cachorro como os indio acreditam? Heim, ai ia inventar uma outra lei - de que os cachorros teriam o direito de se casar com uma pessoa, por essa cultura de fé se manifestar na cultura religiosa brasileira.<br>  <br>  Bom <br>  mas de qualquer uma das formas o importante aqui n?o é a lei em si mas sim a finalidade da lei, porque se for para dar Dinheiro às Igrejas, que bom - pelos menos os fieis acordam e vêm que n?o precisa mais dar oferta porque a Igreja sempre alegou que os recursos doados livremente como ofertas nas Igrejas é para programas sociais - o que n?o é verdade, é simm para comprar carros carr?es construir casar?es em ilhas paradisiácas, viver orgias sexuais, e corromper meia duzia de ignorantes de que Deus esta nisso.<br>  eu gostaria mesmo é que todas as pessoas psercebem que tanto a Igreja Católica ou qualquer outra religi?o é apenas manipula??o, e que Deus esta dentro de cada um, e isso bastasse - queria mesmo é que a lei fosse a favor de que essas Igrejas que vivem manipualndo a fé alheia fossem todos para cadeia sabe. Aí as pessoas iam acordar dizendo que afinal n?o passou de manipula??o, mas enquanto houver na política corruptos isso n?o vai acontecer. alias - Bush vive atonito querendo implantar cristianismo no Iraque e no Mundo Arabe levando para la Madonald em troca de Petroleo.

A.<br>  <br>  Desde la ni?ez fue muy piadoso, sin pertenecer a ninguna religión, y tenía escasa salud. El mismo cuenta que a los 15 a?os tuvo su primera revelación. Aparecieron dos personajes, uno de ellos habló al otro se?alando a José Smith, le dijo que era necesaria una renovación del Evangelio de Jesucristo.<br>  <br>  El a?o 1823 asegura que se le apareció otro personaje, Moroni que le dijo que en cierto lugar había un libro conservado por el don y el poder de Dios, escrito por Mormón 1500 a?os antes sobre planchas de oro, el cual encerraba la plenitud del Evangelio.<br>  <br>  Al encontrar dicho libro no pudo leerlo, puesto que estaba escrito en una lengua y con caracteres desconocidos. Se le proporcionaron dos talismanes, los urim y los tumín del Antiguo Testamento, un sistema de lentes a base de piedras preciosas, que le permiten entender el texto y dictar su traducción a varias secretarias, ya que el mismo no sabía escribir. Al concluirse la traducción, un ángel se llevó el libro original.<br>  <br>  Narra el libro que después de que la humanidad quedó dispersada en Babilonia, los Jereditas, descendientes de Henoc, llegaron a América Luego llegaron los Lamanitas. Los indios americanos son judíos lle gados a América unos 600 a?os antes de Cristo. El propio Jesús llegó a América, una vez resucitado, para formar en el Nuevo Mundo una Iglesia con otros doce apóstoles.<br>  <br>  Después de muchas guerras entre ellos esta Iglesia desapareció 400 a?os después de Cristo.<br>  <br>  Para que todo esto no pareciera un cuento Smith hizo firmar a once de sus seguidores una declaración según la cual también ellos habían visto el libro original. Más tarde tres de ellos Cowdey, Whitmer y Harris, retiraron su testimonio y abandonaron el Mormonismo.<br>  <br>  Siguieron las apariciones, un día se le apareció un mensajero del cielo y ordenó a Smith sacerdote diciéndole: En el nombre del Mesías te confiero el sacerdocio de Aarón. Más tarde se le apareció San Juan Bautista, que lo ordenó según el orden de Melquisedec.<br>  <br>  El 6 de Abril de 1830 José Smith fundó la nueva religión, declarando que después de 1500 a?os el primitivo Evangelio quedaba restaurado con todas sus carismas y poder.<br>  <br>  Estableció la primera Iglesia en Lafayette. Nueva York. De allá se traslado con sus seguidores a Kirland, a Jackson City, a Nauveo, donde en l843 declaró haberle sido revelado que la poligamia tenía que ser una de las doctrinas básicas de la nueva Iglesia, queriendo obligar a sus seguidores a cumplir con esta ense?anza provocando una verdadera sublevación en su contra.<br>  <br>  Fue hecho prisionero por el ejercito junto con su hermano Hiram en la cárcel de Cártago. De alli los sacó la turba de enfurecidos por tanto atrevimiento y los mataron el 27 de junio del a?o de 1844.<br>  <br>  Sucedió a Smith , Birgham Young, en el mando de la nueva agrupación religiosa. Este organizó una emigración general de casi todos los mormones hasta Salt Lake City, Utah. Durante 30 a?os logró dar una verdadera organización al mormonismo. Murió el a?o 1877, dejando 27 viudas y 56 hijos.<br>  <br>  DOCTRINA<br>  La Biblia es insuficiente para conocer el plan de Dios y lo que hay que hacer para salvarse. Son inspirados también: El libro del Mormón, Doctrinas y Convenios y La Perla de Gran Precio.<br>  <br>  Para salvarse hay que tener en cuenta cuatro ordenanzas:<br>  <br>  La fé en Jesucristo.<br>  <br>  El arrepentimiento.<br>  <br>  El bautismo por inmersión.<br>  <br>  La imposición de las manos para comunicar el don del Espíritu Santo.<br>  <br>  Existen muchos dioses, cada mundo tiene su dios correspondiente.<br>  <br>  También nosotros podemos llegar a ser dioses y regir nuestro mundo.<br>  <br>  Adán vino al paraíso con un cuerpo celeste, trayendo a Eva, una de sus mujeres del cielo. Adán es nuestro padre y nuestro dios.<br>  <br>  Jesús fue engendrado carnalmente por dios-Adán con María.<br>  <br>  Existen dos Iglesias: <br>  <br>  Una es la del Cordero de Dios constituida por los Mormones. La otra es la Iglesia del Diablo, constituida por las demás religiones.<br>  <br>  Los negros son hijos del diablo, están maldecidos por Dios.<br>  <br>  Los espíritus están engendrados por las relaciones sexuales entre dioses y diosas.<br>  <br>  ORGANIZACIóN<br>  Los mormones tienen un régimen teocrático, al estilo del Antiguo Testamento, es decir la religión abarca todos los aspectos de la vida, como si los mormones representaran un estado en el estado.<br>  <br>  Hay dos categorías de sacerdocio: el de Melquisedec con grados de apóstoles, patriarcas, sumos sacerdotes, ancianos y obispos, y el de Aarón, que se interesa por los negocios de este mundo y cuenta con los grados de sacerdotes, maestros y diáconos.<br>  <br>  Eclesiásticamente se dividen en Stakes, que corresponden a diócesis, y Wards, que corresponden a parroquias.<br>  <br>  Una férrea organización eclesiástica, unida a un gran fanatismo para propagar su religión y una sana recolección y administración de los diezmos, representan una de las razones que explican el desarrollo de una secta con doctrinas tan absurdas<br>  <br>  Dios te bendiga|`|tT1hvekjaa	Siiiiii los mormones creen , pero tambien quierennnnn , tu plata.-

There you will find zero to hardly any to blacks, Hispanics and Middle Easterners but the people live in conditions that can be described as a third world.  <br>  <br>  Look at the history of any of the African and Latino countries you might be speaking of and I bet you will see that the country has been exploited for its natural resources, the native people were nearly or in some cases totally exterminated, their sense of self and heritage(languages, traditions,religion) was taken away. For example,just read any non-sugar coated book on the real history of South Africa , and you will see how what I just stated started with the European colonization which lead to Aparteid, the erasing of most of the native languages(how the language of Afrikkaners came about), and the forced removal of thousands of South Africans from their lands.

AA12330800	Your inner eye, is responsible for the experience.... There really isn't anything to be affraid about.... More often then not, it happens because you hit your head, and your brain finally tuned in to the right frequency.  A word of caution should certainly be said, because it is not completely devoid of any danger to your mind, and I've seen a lot of my peers go mad or  worse, because they got caught up in some kind power trip and became psychotic in the end.....<br>  It is not  an enterprise, if you know what I mean.... Many people offer services, for a fee .... I find such people charlatans and do not take them serious for the life of me... <br>  Some experiences do occur at certain turning points in ones life... I remember very vividly when my mother died in the 70's and I was only 15. My mother hospitalised with a severe pneumonia, died on a sunday morning between 6 and 7 am. I woke up quite unexpected, and I saw my mum standing at the foot end of my bed, talking to me, telling me that there were so many things she wanted to tell me about, but that she had no more Time left.....After these words, her body seemed to dissolve into the atmosphere... I've never felt more special than this day, and  it still is an event helping through in my darkest hours, when nothing seems right, and everything looks against me..... I feel blessed with good fortune nowadays. I'm  loved by wonderful man, who shares the same deep feelings of belonging together. Many of our friends claim, that they've been waiting for decades, for us to find eachother like we have, and even though I don't posess the actual memories of our past lives  I remember dreams I had decades ago, about me and him being together in the here and now.... Some dreams actually do come true you know. There is literature enough on the powers of the mind... But be watchfull..... Do not let people lead you into believing everything.... Find your own Path in this, do not let anyone lead you astray|`|0dapuoxnaa	I have had one. I had a kind of heart attack, I fell on floor felt my heart stop and was unable to breathe. Panic seized me for a while and vanished, and I realized I could leave my body which I did and looked down at it. I somehow knew I could fly. Simultaneously I knew that if I flew I would never find my way back. I clearly understood that I died. And I could move through solid objects like walls, doors. The separated part of me was invisible, moved by will, no touch of floor was percepted.  What worried me was that I had locked the door from inside and that they would have to break out the door to find my corps when it will start to stink. I was obsessed with this only thought and approached to the door. I saw the key in the lock and tried to turn it.  My invisible hands went through the key and the door feeling only slight resistance, like water, when going through them. I kept trying over and over concentrating on the key. And the key stirred a bit! I doubled the concentration gathering the universe into one point, such was the feeling, and finally made it turn. I was completely exhausted. And I moved back to my body, and nearly fell on my corpse. I felt relief – I made what I had to make and be what should be. At that moment my heart started to pump and I regained ability to breathe. I opened my eyes: I was lying on the floor. When I became able to move I crawled to the door to check the lock. The door was open.  There were no witnesses so I cannot say for sure that it really happened. But this remains one of my most unusual experiences.|`|49d1b2becb6b5d6e281e943fe7c7597baa	It's kinda  Tele-portation,  without the lauching padd ..

There's at least one ghost in my house that influences this "power", it's kind of cool once you get over how frightening it is. When I first had one, I felt a weird buzzing sensation while half asleep, and I thought I was dying or something. I ran into my parents' room, and tried to wake up my mom. Then I noticed a greenish greyish light coming off me, ran back to my room and went back to bed. It happened two or three more times before I realized what was going on.<br>  Eventually I was able to travel to faraway places, like my old house, and places I've never even been to. What I do is I go to my front door while out of body, and then imagine some place I want to be, and then just go outside and I'm there. I don't know if it's the same for everyone, though.|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	I have some books about this. They tell one how to have an OBE, but they never worked for me.

The moon is bright over my run down house, and the street dogs bark all night to keep me company. There is no fear of thefts because people never come back once they leave this side of the town. We are always happy at the breadline chatting and socializing and attending hospitals and funerals. America is a great country and we don't care why Hillary Clinton didn't divorce her cheating husband or Obama did in fact attended a Islamic school in his childhood. We know Jesus loves us and he is going to come back and take us to heaven. Amen.

8Ak1FehYaa	They say that their God's name is Elohim to and that he has many wives which are goddesses and that Elohim use to be a man and that man can become a God, so in a sence these mormons who claim to be christians, believe in more then one God, because their Christ is married to three women as well and they are all goddesses to, too many gods and goddesses to count.

ojRjukFMaa	Partly right. I agree with the saying that if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention. There is much that we can and should change. There is much that we shoould change even if we are relatively certain that we cannot make a difference. However there are things that we will not be able to change, or that might change but are not given to us to change...it's another person's task and the best we can do is pray for them. Then there are the things we must accept. The trick is being able to tell the difference which is probably why we are believers are told to "pray unceasingly."<br>  <br>  God grant me the serenity <br>  to accept the things I cannot change; <br>  courage to change the things I can;<br>  and wisdom to know the difference. <br>  <br>  Living one day at a time; <br>  Enjoying one moment at a time; <br>  Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; <br>  Taking, as He did, this sinful world<br>  as it is, not as I would have it; <br>  Trusting that He will make all things right<br>  if I surrender to His Will;<br>  That I may be reasonably happy in this life <br>  and supremely happy with Him<br>  Forever in the next.<br>  Amen. <br>  <br>  --Reinhold Niebuhr

O que fazem muitos grupos radicais, mesmo tendo muitos Imans ou Sheiks n?o concordando com esses grupos e seus métodos sanguinários, no Cristianismo temos exemplos cruéis de impor seus dogmas, sejam elas de caráter militar, as cruzadas, por exemplo, ou de caráter religioso, a obrigatoriedade que muitas igrejas evangélicas imp?e de pagamento de dízimos, ofertas e outras formas de angariar recursos muitas vezes usados para constru??o de suntuosos templos, e o amor ao próximo como fica, deve ficar distante dos cofres da igreja para esses lideres.

La peor forma de extra?ar a alguien es estar sentado a su lado y saber que nunca lo podrás tener. <br>  <br>  6. Nunca dejes de sonreír, ni siquiera cuando estés triste, porque nunca sabes quien se puede enamorar de tu sonrisa. <br>  <br>  7. Puedes ser solamente una persona para el mundo, pero para una persona tú eres el mundo. <br>  <br>  8. No pases el tiempo con alguien que no esté dispuesto a pasarlo contigo. <br>  <br>  9. Quizá Dios quiera que conozcas mucha gente equivocada antes de que conozcas a la persona adecuada, para que cuando al fin la conozcas sepas estar agradecido. <br>  <br>  10. No llores porque ya se terminó, sonríe porque sucedió. <br>  <br>  11. Siempre habrá gente que te lastime, así que lo que tienes que hacer es seguir confiando y solo ser más cuidadoso en quien confías dos veces. <br>  <br>  12.

Espero que lo sigas...<br>  NUNCA te juntes con personas negativas o refugiados que estan en tu país.. Los refugiados son personas que o no son sinceras y sólo buscan beneficios del gobierno, o bien.. son personas llenas de problemas y traumas (en el caso que no esten mintiendo)<br>  <br>  Si vives en USA (por ejemplo) trata de hacer amistades con americanos.. Ellos no te van a llenar la cabeza de ideas negativas sobre su país, al contrario.. te van a querer mostrar lo bello que tienen y a tratar de demostrar también que su país es el mejor del mundo (aunque tú nunca lo veas así) Integrate a la nueva sociedad que TU eligiste para vivir.. aceptala y se parte de ella.. de otra forma solo te sentiras perdido en ese pais y no encontrars el sentido de tu vida ahi.<br>  <br>  Todo ese positivismo es crucial para tu vida emocional, porque si te dejas afligir caerás en una depresión impresionante...

AA10279855	Thank you very much for posting an intelligent, perceptive question.<br>  For the life of me, I can't understand why people with no scientific training feel qualified to quack out unscientific propaganda, and - to add insult to injury - use YA to spread the stupidity.  And even worse, there are people on here who actually take them seriously.  It's all a sad commentary on the state of intellect in the First World today.<br>  I will give credit where it's due - at least Oprah Winfrey has half a brain, even if she doesn't use it all the time.  Al Gore and Bono don't seem to have two brain cells to rub together between them.|`|577c65badc4c3c922a9ed289ba83e4a6aa	whether or not it happens, they want to warn us about floods and erosion to be caused by global warming.

You can't believe that 169 countries participating in the Kyoto Treaty are deluded?|`|OBwqjS8maa	I don't understand why people have a problem with this. If it wasn't for people like Bono, Oprah and Bob Geldof, most people (especially in the United States) wouldn't even KNOW about these problems. They have clout because people know who they are and respect what they have to say.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but I think it's utterly ridiculous when people say things like, "If so-and-so cares so much, why don't they give all their money to charity?" I mean, how many people, in their positions, would do that? How many people in their positions would even do ANYTHING with regards to raising awareness for these types of issues?<br>  <br>  It seems to me that some people will never be satisfied. If people like Bono and Oprah DON'T talk about these issues, people think they don't care. When they DO try to raise awareness though, people are like "look at you in your big house on hill. Hypocrite."<br>  <br>  We are ALL hypocrites. I, for one, admire the work they're doing and hope they keep at it.

As humans are small group animals, religion meets this need for people.<br>  <br>  2. Most nonotheistic religions teach an elitest view on the world and as such, when you are apart of it you feel good for being part of such a special group.<br>  <br>  3. Within such groups, you are told specificaly how to act and the choices that are "correct". When you go along with this, you are supporting and likewise being supported by the group. This is very much ingrained into the evolved human psyche and is rewarded by many chemicals.<br>  <br>  4. It also gives you simple answers to hard questions that allow you to stop thinking. Such as the creationism style of thought, why do research on science when its so easy to just say "god did it".<br>  <br>  5.

Hablar lenguas no es proferir lenguas de angeles, ni lenguajes incomprensibles.<br>  Sino la habilidad ‘sobrenatural’ obrada por el Espíritu Santo por medio de la cual una persona puede hablar con fluidez en lenguas (idiomas) nunca antes aprendidas, la cual nos habla San Pablo en Carta a los Corintos.<br>  El primer hecho histórico de este don se dio Hechos 2, la reunión de los Apostoles y la repartición de lenguas sobre cada uno de ellos “..Y se le aparecieron lenguas repartidas como de fuego y comenzaron a hablar en el otras lenguas como el Espíritu les daba que hablasen”.<br>  El propósito de las Lenguas, según el apóstol Pablo, es de servir como se?al a los no-creyentes…<br>  1 Corintios 14:22 Así que, las lenguas son por se?al, no a los creyentes, sino a los incrédulos; pero la profecía, no a los incrédulos, sino a los creyentes.<br>  1 Corintios 14: 20 Hermanos, no seáis ni?os en el modo de pensar, sino sed ni?os en la malicia, pero maduros en el modo de pensar. 21 En la ley está escrito: En otras lenguas y con otros labios hablaré a este pueblo; y ni aun así me oirán, dice el Se?or.<br>  El Don de Lenguas  era un don sobre el cual la iglesia tanto Católica Romana como la Protestante gozaba de unidad de pensamiento. Los Cristianos de todos los grupos en su gran mayoría consideraban el don de Lenguas como uno que había quedado atrás con la terminación del Canon Bíblico y la muerte de los Apóstoles. Es cierto que a través de los casi 1900 a?os de historia de la iglesia se levantaron personas y uno que otro grupo reclamando el don de las lenguas pero aquellos grupos dieron evidencias de ser movimientos extremistas y herejes los cuales fueron condenados por el Cristianismo Ortodoxo. Este evento comenzó un movimiento que hoy es conocido como Pentecostalismo y/ o Carismatísmo. Este es el principio y el final del DON DE LENGUAS.

cLWWpcrmaa	Simply put - "Hate is easy, love takes courage."<br>  <br>  Meaning rather than instinct is so overwhelmingly important to our species – and to our distinctive toolmaking cultures – that our limbic system has evolved a powerful tendency to blindly interpret any meaning system that we deeply believe in as substantially enhancing our survival and reproduction. Someone who wholeheartedly converts to a particular religion or political ideology, for example, is likely to experience strong primal feelings of joy and well being coupled with an exiting new sense of purpose. This is true even if the belief system has elements that are bizarre or self-destructive.  Because of this unusual feature of the human brain, strongly held meaning systems are capable of decoupling our behavior from the objective criteria of survival and reproduction. If a particular group’s strongly held meaning system calls on it’s members to be celibate and suicidal, their primitive brain areas will tend to presume that this is the best way to ensure their survival and reproduction, even though rationally, of course, it is not.  At the end of WWII, there was no lack of kamikaze pilots willing to die by crashing their explosive-laden aircraft into American warships. These young Japanese airmen were guided by a meaning system centered on emperor-worship, which placed a high value on dying for the emperor.<br>  <br>  The immense significance of meaning to human beings and its distinctive link in our species to the primitive emotional centers of the brain lay the groundwork for a primary source of hatred: fanaticism and intolerance. Lacking specific instincts, humans have no innate identity. It is meaning systems that provide us with our personal sense of meaning and purpose.  The tremendous emotional commitment we tend to make to these systems leaves us vulnerable to interpreting differences in meaning as threats to our survival and reproduction. Many of the most savage conflicts in history have involved quarrels over religious, political and cultural systems of meaning. <br>  <br>  We hate because we feel at the deepest levels of our psyche that we are being threatened.  It is easier to understand a person’s hate when they or their loved ones are directly threatened with harm but harder to understand hate and violence when it is directed at a person or group that is not a direct threat to someone’s physical wellbeing.  Challenges to our belief system, our way of making meaning for our lives, can evoke the powerful primal fight or flight response.  The same advances that link our primal responses to our meaning systems are also what allow us to overcome these responses.  We are not at the mercy of the fight or flight response or the primitive part of our neural system that allows only for generalizations.<br>  <br>  Hate thrives when we lose the individuality of the members of a group.  We have an innate tendency, called the binary instinct, to divide the world into us and them. It is a way for us to create “order in a world otherwise overwhelming in flux and detail,” according to Harvard biologist Edward Wilson.  The combination of generalization and us-them mentality interferes with our ability to empathize with those in the “them” group.  This lack of empathy is one of the most surprising and disturbing aspects of hate.  It is what allows humans to engage gleefully in cruelty and torture.  Our ability to reason can overcome this innate tendency.  In a recent article in the Globe, Harvard psychologist Jerome Kagan contends that the language of neuroscience is not enough.  We will always need to include morality meaning and love when discussing psychological reasons for human behavior.  Scientific information about the functions of the brain cannot alone guide our morality.  Our ability to judge right and wrong, and the systems of meaning and morality that we create can be used to combat hate in ourselves and in others.<br>  <br>  Like the leaky bucket in the story for all ages, we are imperfect vessels.  Our physical human brains and bodies have inherent weaknesses.  However, the same complexities of the human brain that make hate a human reality are also what give us the opportunity and ability to overcome hatred.

Os indícios s?o na maneira de olhar, conversar e até mesmo se comportar. Claro, n?o s?o todas. Há aquelas que sabem ser discretas, educadas e que ninguém descobre que s?o. Tenho uma vizinha, bem assumida, mas sinto que ela n?o é feliz  porque ela n?o teve um acompanhamento e é de uma família com uma estrutura um pouco arcaica e de pouca cultura. Aí se torna difícil, porque ela fala demais, conta seus casos e até tenta dar umas cantadas nas mulheres. Fica muito difícil ser amiga dela porque ela mesmo faz com que as pessoas se afastem. Seus tra?os s?o de uma pessoa que se veste como homem e de de uma pessoa  triste, parece faltando talvez um bom papo, amizade ou até mesmo DEUS para ajudá-la nessa caminhada dela.

Mas escolhe os seres que lhes s?o simpáticos. Para uns é um prazer; para outros, uma miss?o ou um dever.<br>  <br>  493 a Ao se ligar a uma pessoa o Espírito renuncia a proteger<br>  outros indivíduos?<br>  – N?o, mas n?o faz só isso, exclusivamente.<br>  <br>  494 O Espírito protetor está inevitavelmente ligado à criatura confiada à sua guarda?<br>  – Pode ocorrer que alguns Espíritos tenham que deixar sua posi??o para realizar diversas miss?es, mas nesse caso s?o substituídos.<br>  <br>  495 O Espírito protetor abandona algumas vezes seu protegido<br>  quando este é rebelde aos seus conselhos?<br>  – Ele se afasta quando vê que seus conselhos s?o inúteis e a vontade de aceitar a influência dos Espíritos inferiores é mais forte no seu protegido. Mas n?o o abandona completamente e sempre se faz ouvir; é, porém, o homem quem fecha os ouvidos. O protetor volta logo que seja chamado.<br>  é uma doutrina que deveria converter os mais incrédulos por seu encanto e por sua do?ura: a dos anjos de guarda. Pensar que se tem sempre perto de si seres superiores, sempre prontos para aconselhar, sustentar, ajudar a escalar a áspera montanha do bem, que s?o amigos mais seguros e devotados que as mais íntimas liga??es que se possa ter na Terra, n?o é<br>  uma idéia bem consoladora? Esses seres est?o ao vosso lado por ordem de Deus, que por amor os colocou perto de vós, cumprindo uma bela, embora difícil, miss?o. Sim, em qualquer lugar onde estiverdes estar?o convosco: nas pris?es, nos hospitais, nos lugares de devassid?o, na solid?o, nada vos separa desses amigos que n?o podeis ver, mas de quem vossa<br>  alma sente os mais doces estímulos e ouve os sábios conselhos.<br>  Deveríeis conhecer melhor essa verdade! Quantas vezes vos ajudaria nos momentos de crise; quantas vezes vos salvaria dos maus Espíritos! Mas no dia decisivo, esse anjo do bem terá que vos dizer: “N?o te disse isso? E tu n?o o fizeste. N?o te mostrei o abismo? E tu aí te precipitaste. N?o te fiz ouvir na tua consciência a voz da verdade? E n?o seguiste os conselhos da<br>  mentira?” Ah! Interrogai os vossos anjos de guarda; estabelecei entre eles e vós essa ternura íntima que reina entre os melhores amigos. N?o penseis em lhes esconder nada, porque eles s?o os olhos de Deus e n?o podeis enganá-los. Sonhai com o futuro. Procurai avan?ar nessa vida e vossas provas ser?o mais curtas; vossas existências, mais felizes. Vamos, homens de coragem! Atirai para longe de vós de uma vez por todas os preconceitos<br>  e idéias retrógradas. Entrai no novo caminho que se abre diante de vós.<br>  Marchai! Marchai! Tendes guias, segui-os: o objetivo n?o pode vos faltar, porque esse objetivo é o próprio Deus.<br>  Aos que pensam que é impossível para os Espíritos verdadeiramente elevados se sujeitarem a uma tarefa t?o árdua e de todos os instantes, diremos que influenciamos vossas almas estando a milh?es e milh?es de quil?metros. Para nós o espa?o n?o é nada e, embora vivendo em outro mundo, nossos Espíritos conservam sua liga??o com o vosso. Nós podemos usar de faculdades que n?o podeis compreender, mas ficais certos de que Deus n?o nos imp?s uma tarefa acima de nossas for?as e n?o vos abandonou sozinhos na Terra sem amigos e sem apoio. Cada anjo de guarda tem seu protegido por quem vela, como um pai vela pelo seu filho.<br>  Fica feliz quando o vê no bom caminho; fica triste quando seus conselhos s?o desprezados.<br>  N?o temais nos cansar com vossas quest?es. Ao contrário, procurai estar sempre em rela??o conosco: sereis mais fortes e felizes. S?o essas comunica??es de cada homem com seu Espírito familiar que fazem de todos os homens médiuns, médiuns ignorados hoje, mas que se manifestar?o mais tarde e que se espalhar?o como um oceano sem limites para repelir a incredulidade e a ignorancia. Homens instruídos, instruí os<br>  vossos irm?os; homens de talento, elevai vossos irm?os. N?o sabeis que obra cumprireis assim: é a do Cristo, a que Deus vos conferiu. Por que Deus vos deu a inteligência e a ciência, sen?o para as repartir com vossos irm?os, para fazê-los adiantarem-se no caminho da alegria e da felicidade eterna?<br>  A doutrina dos anjos de guarda, velando sobre seus protegidos<br>  apesar da distancia que separa os mundos, n?o tem nada que deva surpreender; é, ao contrário, grande e sublime. N?o vemos na Terra um pai velar pelo seu filho, embora esteja afastado dele, ajudá-lo com seus conselhos por correspondência? O que haveria, ent?o, de espantoso em que os Espíritos pudessem guiar aqueles que tomam sob sua prote??o, de um mundo a outro, uma vez que para eles a distancia que separa os mundos é menor do que aquela que, na Terra, separa os continentes? Eles n?o disp?em, por outro lado, do fluido universal, que liga todos os mundos e os torna solidários, veículo magnífico da transmiss?o dos pensamentos, como o ar é, para nós, o veículo da transmiss?o do som?<br>  <br>  496 O Espírito que abandona seu protegido, n?o lhe fazendo mais o bem, pode lhe fazer o mal?<br>  – Os bons Espíritos nunca fazem o mal; deixam que o fa?am os que tomam o seu lugar. Acusais, ent?o, a sorte pelas infelicidades que vos acontecem, quando a culpa é vossa.<br>  <br>  497 O Espírito protetor pode deixar seu protegido sob a depen-<br>  dência de um Espírito que poderia lhe querer o mal?<br>  – Os maus Espíritos se unem para neutralizar a a??o dos bons. Se o protegido quiser, receberá toda a for?a de seu bom Espírito. O bom Espírito encontra, em algum lugar, uma boa vontade para ajudar; aproveita-se disso enquanto espera retornar para junto do seu protegido.<br>  <br>  498 Quando o Espírito protetor deixa seu protegido se transviar<br>  no caminho, é por sua incapacidade na luta contra outros Espíritos maldosos?<br>  – N?o. N?o é porque ele n?o possa impedir, mas porque n?o quer. Isso faz seu protegido sair das provas mais perfeito e instruído; ele o assiste com seus conselhos, pelos bons pensamentos que lhe sugere, mas, infelizmente, nem sempre s?o escutados. Somente a fraqueza, a negligência ou orgulho do homem é que d?o for?a aos maus Espíritos; o poder que têm sobre vós resulta de n?o lhes fazer resistência.<br>  <br>  499 O Espírito protetor está constantemente com seu protegido?<br>  N?o há nenhuma circunstancia em que, sem abandoná-lo, o perca de vista?<br>  – Há circunstancias em que a presen?a do Espírito protetor n?o é necessária junto de seu protegido.<br>  <br>  500 Chega um momento em que o Espírito n?o tem mais neces-<br>  sidade de um anjo de guarda?<br>  – Sim, quando atingiu um grau de poder conduzir-se a si mesmo, como chega o momento para o estudante em que n?o tem mais necessidade do mestre; mas isso n?o sucederá para vós aqui na Terra.<br>  <br>  501 Por que a a??o dos Espíritos sobre nossa existência é oculta e por que, quando nos protegem, n?o o fazem de um maneira ostensiva?<br>  – Se contásseis com o seu apoio, n?o agiríeis por vós mesmos, e vosso Espírito n?o progrediria. Para progredir, vos é preciso experiência e, muitas vezes, é preciso adquiri-la à própria custa. é preciso que exer?a suas for?as; sem isso seria como uma crian?a a quem n?o se deixa caminhar sozinha. A a??o dos Espíritos que vos querem bem é sempre regida de maneira a n?o impedir o vosso livre-arbítrio, visto que, se n?o tiverdes<br>  responsabilidade, n?o avan?areis no caminho que deve conduzir a Deus.<br>  O homem, n?o vendo quem o ampara, confia em suas próprias for?as; seu guia, entretanto, vela sobre ele e, de tempos em tempos, o adverte do perigo.<br>  <br>  502 O Espírito protetor que consegue conduzir seu protegido no<br>  bom caminho tem alguma recompensa?<br>  – é um mérito que lhe é levado em conta para seu próprio adiantamento ou para sua felicidade. é feliz quando vê seus esfor?os coroados de sucesso; triunfa como um mestre triunfa com o sucesso de seu discípulo. <br>  <br>  502 a Ele é responsável se n?o tiver êxito?<br>  – N?o, uma vez que fez o que dependia dele.<br>  <br>  503 O Espírito protetor sofre quando vê seu protegido seguir o<br>  mau caminho, apesar de seus conselhos? Isso n?o é para ele uma causa de perturba??o para sua felicidade?<br>  – Ele sofre com esses erros e o lastima; mas essa afli??o n?o tem as angústias da paternidade terrestre, porque sabe que há remédio para o mal, e o que n?o é feito hoje se fará amanh?.<br>  <br>  504 Podemos sempre saber o nome do nosso Espírito protetor<br>  ou anjo de guarda?<br>  – Como quereis saber nomes que n?o existem para vós? Acreditais que haverá entre os Espíritos somente aqueles que conhecestes?<br>  <br>  504 a Como, ent?o, invocá-lo se n?o o conhecemos?<br>  – Dai-lhe o nome que quiserdes, de um Espírito Superior pelo qual tendes simpatia ou venera??o; vosso Espírito protetor atenderá ao chamado; todos os bons Espíritos s?o irm?os e se assistem entre si.<br>  <br>  505 Os Espíritos protetores que tomam nomes conhecidos s?o<br>  sempre, realmente, os das pessoas que usaram esses nomes?<br>  – N?o, mas dos Espíritos que lhes s?o simpáticos e que muitas vezes vêm a seu chamado. Fazeis quest?o de nomes, ent?o, tomam um que inspire confian?a. Quando n?o podeis realizar uma miss?o pessoalmente, costumais mandar alguém de confian?a em vosso nome.<br>  <br>  506 Quando estivermos na vida espírita reconheceremos nosso<br>  Espírito protetor?<br>  – Sim. Muitas vezes já o conhecíeis antes da vossa encarna??o.<br>  <br>  507 Os Espíritos protetores pertencem todos à classe dos Espíritos Superiores? Pode-se encontrar entre os de classe intermediária? Um pai, por exemplo, pode tornar-se protetor de seu filho?<br>  – Pode. Mas a prote??o sup?e um certo grau de eleva??o e um poder ou uma virtude concedidos por Deus. O pai que protege seu filho pode, por sua vez, ser assistido por um Espírito mais elevado.<br>  <br>  508 Os Espíritos que deixaram a Terra em boas condi??es po-<br>  dem sempre proteger os que amam e que lhes sobrevivem?<br>  – Seu poder é mais ou menos restrito; a posi??o em que se encontram n?o lhes dá toda a liberdade de a??o.<br>  <br>  509 Os homens no estado selvagem ou de inferioridade moral<br>  têm igualmente seus Espíritos protetores? E, nesse caso, esses Espíritos s?o de ordem t?o elevada quanto a dos protetores dos homens mais avan?ados?<br>  – Cada homem tem um Espírito que vela por ele, mas as miss?es s?o relativas ao seu objetivo. N?o dareis a uma crian?a que come?a a aprender a ler um professor de filosofia. O progresso do Espírito familiar segue de perto o do Espírito protegido. Tendo vós mesmos um Espírito Superior que vela por vós, podeis, também, tornar-vos protetor de um Espírito inferior, e os progressos que o ajudardes a fazer contribuir?o para o vosso adiantamento. Deus n?o pede ao Espírito mais do que sua natureza comporta e o grau de eleva??o a que alcan?ou.<br>  <br>  510 Quando o pai que vela por um filho reencarna, continua a<br>  velar por ele?<br>  – é mais difícil que isso aconte?a. Mas, de certa maneira, continua, ao pedir, num momento de desprendimento, a um Espírito simpático que o assista nessa miss?o. Aliás, os Espíritos apenas aceitam miss?es que podem cumprir até o fim.<br>  O Espírito encarnado, principalmente nos mundos em que a existência é material, está muito submetido ao seu corpo para poder ser inteiramente devotado a um outro Espírito e poder assisti-lo pessoalmente. Eis por que aqueles que n?o s?o suficientemente elevados s?o assistidos por Espíritos Superiores, de tal modo que, se um falta por uma causa qualquer, é substituído por outro. <br>  <br>  511 Além do Espírito protetor, haverá também um mau Espírito<br>  ligado a cada indivíduo com o fim de o expor ao mal e lhe fornecer ocasi?o de lutar entre o bem e o mal?<br>  – Ligado n?o é bem a palavra. é bem verdade que os maus Espíritos procuram desviá-lo do bom caminho quando encontram ocasi?o; mas quando um deles se liga a um indivíduo, o faz por si mesmo, porque espera ser escutado. Desse modo, há a luta entre o bom e o mau e vence aquele<br>  por quem o homem se deixa influenciar.<br>  <br>  512 Podemos ter muitos Espíritos protetores?<br>  – Cada homem sempre tem Espíritos simpáticos, mais ou menos elevados, que lhe dedicam afei??o e se interessam por ele, como igualmente tem os que o assistem no mal.<br>  <br>  513 Os Espíritos que nos s?o simpáticos agem em cumprimento de uma miss?o?<br>  – Algumas vezes, podem ter uma miss?o temporária, mas quase sempre s?o atraídos pela semelhan?a de pensamentos e de sentimentos, tanto para o bem quanto para o mal.<br>  <br>  513 a Parece resultar disso que os Espíritos simpáticos podem<br>  ser bons ou maus?<br>  – Sim, o homem encontra sempre Espíritos que simpatizam com ele, qualquer que seja o seu caráter.<br>  <br>  514 Os Espíritos familiares s?o os mesmos Espíritos simpáticos<br>  ou protetores?<br>  – Há muitas grada??es na prote??o e na simpatia; dai-lhes os nomes que quiserdes. O Espírito familiar é antes o amigo da casa. <br>  <br>  Das explica??es acima e das observa??es feitas sobre a natureza dos Espíritos que se ligam ao homem pode-se deduzir o seguinte:<br>  O Espírito protetor, anjo de guarda ou bom gênio tem por miss?o<br>  seguir o homem na vida e ajudá-lo a progredir. é sempre de natureza superior à do protegido.<br>  Os Espíritos familiares se ligam a certas pessoas por la?os mais ou menos duráveis, para ajudá-las conforme seu poder, muitas vezes limitado. S?o bons, mas, às vezes, pouco avan?ados e mesmo um pouco levianos; ocupam-se voluntariamente dos detalhes da vida íntima e somente agem por ordem ou com permiss?o dos Espíritos protetores.<br>  Os Espíritos simpáticos se ligam a nós por afei??es particulares e certa semelhan?a de gostos e de sentimentos tanto para o bem quanto para o mal. A dura??o de suas rela??es é quase sempre subordinada às circunstancias.<br>  O mau gênio é um Espírito imperfeito ou perverso que se liga ao<br>  homem para desviá-lo do bem, mas age por sua própria iniciativa e n?o no cumprimento de uma miss?o. A constancia da sua a??o está em raz?o do acesso mais ou menos fácil que encontra. O homem tem a liberdade para escutar-lhe a voz ou rejeitá-la.<br>  <br>  515 O que pensar dessas pessoas que parecem se ligar a certos indivíduos para os levar fatalmente à perdi??o ou para guiá-los no bom caminho?<br>  – Algumas pessoas exercem, de fato, sobre outras uma espécie de fascina??o que parece irresistível. Quando isso acontece para o mal, s?o maus Espíritos que se servem de outros igualmente maus para melhor poderem subjugar. A Providência permite que isso ocorra para vos por à prova.<br>  <br>  516 Nosso bom e mau gênio poderiam encarnar para nos acompanhar na vida de uma maneira mais direta?<br>  – Isso pode acontecer. Porém, freqüentemente encarregam dessa miss?o outros Espíritos encarnados que lhes s?o simpáticos.<br>  <br>  517 Há Espíritos que se ligam a toda uma família para protegê-la?<br>  – Alguns Espíritos se ligam aos membros de uma família em conjunto e que s?o unidos pela afei??o, mas n?o acrediteis em Espíritos protetores do orgulho das ra?as.<br>  <br>  518 Os Espíritos que s?o atraídos para os indivíduos pela sua<br>  simpatia também o s?o para as reuni?es de indivíduos em raz?o de causas particulares?<br>  – Os Espíritos v?o de preferência onde est?o seus semelhantes; lá est?o mais à vontade e mais certos de serem escutados. O homem atrai os Espíritos em raz?o de suas tendências, quer esteja só ou formando uma coletividade, como uma sociedade, uma cidade ou um povo. Há, portanto, sociedades, cidades e povos que s?o assistidos por Espíritos mais ou menos elevados, segundo o caráter e as paix?es que os dominam. Os Espíritos imperfeitos se afastam daqueles que os repelem; resulta<br>  disso que o aperfei?oamento moral de todas as coletividades, como o dos indivíduos, tende a afastar os maus Espíritos e atrair os bons, que estimulam e mantêm o sentimento do bem nas massas, como outros podem estimular as paix?es grosseiras.<br>  519 As aglomera??es de indivíduos, como as sociedades, as ci-<br>  dades, as na??es, têm seus Espíritos protetores especiais?<br>  – Sim, porque s?o de individualidades coletivas que marcham com um objetivo comum e têm necessidade de uma dire??o superior.<br>  <br>  520 Os Espíritos protetores das massas s?o de natureza mais<br>  elevada do que os que se ligam aos indivíduos?<br>  – Tudo é relativo ao grau de adiantamento tanto das massas como dos indivíduos.<br>  <br>  521 Certos Espíritos podem ajudar no progresso das artes ao<br>  proteger aqueles que se ocupam delas?<br>  – Há Espíritos protetores especiais que assistem aos que os invocam quando os julgam dignos. Porém, n?o deveis acreditar que consigam fazer com que os indivíduos sejam aquilo que n?o s?o. Eles n?o fazem os cegos enxergarem, nem os surdos ouvirem.<br>  Os antigos fizeram desses Espíritos divindades especiais. As Musas eram a personifica??o alegórica dos Espíritos protetores das ciências e das artes, como designavam sob o nome de Lares e Penates os Espíritos protetores da família. Modernamente, também, as artes, as diferentes indústrias, as cidades, os continentes têm seus patronos protetores, Espíritos Superiores, mas sob outros nomes.<br>  Cada homem tem Espíritos que lhe s?o simpáticos, e resulta disso que, em todas as coletividades, a generalidade dos espíritos simpáticos está em rela??o com a generalidade dos indivíduos; que os Espíritos de costumes e procedimentos estranhos s?o atraídos para essas coletividades pela identidade dos gostos e dos pensamentos; em uma palavra, que essas multid?es de pessoas, assim como os indivíduos, s?o mais<br>  ou menos bem assistidos e influenciados conforme a natureza dos pensamentos dos que os comp?em.<br>  Entre os povos, as causas de atra??o dos Espíritos s?o os costumes, os hábitos, o caráter dominante e principalmente as leis, porque o caráter de uma na??o se reflete em suas leis. Os homens que fazem reinar a justi?a entre si combatem a influência dos maus Espíritos. Em toda parte onde as leis consagram injusti?as, contrárias à humanidade, os bons Espíritos est?o em minoria e a massa dos maus se reúne e<br>  mantém a na??o sob o domínio das suas idéias e paralisa as boas influências parciais que ficam perdidas na multid?o, como uma espiga isolada no meio dos espinheiros. Ao estudar os costumes dos povos ou de qualquer reuni?o de homens, é fácil, portanto, fazer uma idéia da popula??o oculta que se infiltra em seus pensamentos e em suas a??es. <br>  <br>  Fonte:<br>  O Livro dos Espíritos, de Allan Kardec<br>  <a href="http://www.omensageiro.com.br/doutrina/" rel="nofollow">http://www.omensageiro.com.br/doutrina/</a>|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	Meu santo protetor e o de todos s?o os anjos porque a eles Deus deu a tarefa de zelar por nós aqui na terra.

6c2d67d35428a0ba09bb666bb3761a03aa	There are several languages in the Middle East and South ASIA, and even more dialects. However, I learned form my Indian friend that this means 'blacky'. I came to know it's meaning because someone called my friend this word. <br>  But as mentioned already, there are HUNDREDS of different languages in these two areas.

No, it has nothing to do with asking.  It has to do with receiving, free gift means free gift, your eyes are simply opened, you would not have the ability to even seek out God if it wasn't for His direct intervention in your life.<br>  <br>  "Have to" implies works that you do to earn your salvation, and this cannot happen.  Your works are what you do out of joy and fellowship with the Creator.  So I disagree with your question as well as your proposed solutions.|`|uufx7T8kaa	You must ask to be made a new creature with all sincerity by calling Jesus into your spirit and by asking for total forgiveness of all your sins.   You must build a relationship with Him and the Holy Spirit who now lives inside you once you've ask to be transformed.  And you must join a bible based church.  This is so that you can be part of the Church body not walk around in limbo trying to figure it all out on your own.  And furthermore you should learn to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit who now dwells inside you.  This all takes time but is well worth the time.  You should also understand that asking for the forgiveness of sins is a life long thing.  Because you will get sin in your heart just being on this planet.  It is like spiritual dirt and will keep you from reaping full rewards for your life.|`|0PHIFG14aa	I wish I could ski for salvation!

Much more. Once you ask Christ to come into your life and be your Lord and Savior, and become born-again of the spirit, you are then not your own. You are bought with a price, which was the life of our Savior, which is Christ Jesus. You then have a responsibility to Him ( which most that call themselves Christians do not seem to realize ), as you are an ambassador, or you represent Christ . You are called to love all people, live a holy life, be sanctified unto God, separate yourself from the world ( we live IN the world, but are not to be OF the world ), and spread the good news about what Jesus has done for you in your life, uplifting Him in praise, in prayer, and in worship.<br>  Be strong in your faith in Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, you are to READ YOUR BIBLE !!! Study to show yourself approved, knowing the truth, so that men cannot deceive you. So that you will not believe false doctrine, as the mormons, jehovah's witnesses, and catholics do. The Holy Bible is the ONLY book that you need for obtaining salvation. If someone tells you differently, they are lying to you, and the truth is not in them.|`|9Cmigz4yaa	Well, if you are a Christian, all you have to do is what your church tells you to do.  Since every denomination is different, you will have to find out what your church demands. <br>  <br>  If you believe in Christianity and you are a thinking person, then you can start reading and determine what it is you believe must be done to receive eternal life from God.  From my studies in Christian theology, what the Bible says is that all you have to do is confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that your sins are forgiven.<br>  <br>  Now that I don't believe Christianity is the path for me, I would have to say that you have to determine this on your own.  Taking what anyone else says into your heart just opens you up to confusion.  <br>  <br>  You are smart - and you can get to your own decission about what you believe.|`|AxScsWdpaa	Yes, praise the Lord that salvation is His free gift to us!!!!!!!!|`|WkA8UPflaa	God knows are hearts and if we truly have accepted the gift of eternal life then nothing else is required.

There are some saved catholics, but the catholic belief that salvation cannot occur outside of their church is a false doctrine, as are many of the other things they claim.  D.  Same as B.  F.  Doing works after being a believer will increase your reward in heaven, but works do not provide salvation.  Faith and belief do.|`|pcwOsWbUaa	I think the most appropriate answer is: you must follow God's commandments. There are many groups that think those commandments are different. However, you have the ability to pray to God and ask Him to reveal to you which of the many Churches are true and teach the true commandments you should follow.<br>  <br>  I can testify that the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS, or Mormon) teaches this truth. As for commandments, following the Articles of Faith:<br>  <br>    3 We believe that through the aAtonement of Christ, all bmankind may be csaved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.<br>    4 We believe that the first principles and aordinances of the Gospel are: first, bFaith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, cRepentance; third, dBaptism by eimmersion for the fremission of sins; fourth, Laying on of ghands for the hgift of the Holy Ghost.

3ukHqXnpaa	I love how you said "his families" lol! Most mormons try to deny that Joseph Smith had more than one wife.<br>  <br>  Anyway, my testimony is that he was a repressed middle child with an imaginative mind who saw his chance to escape poverty and make a name for himself, which he did in a monumental way. He knew how to change his story and develop it as the situation warranted and had the charisma to trick people into paying him to find buried treasure for them. This charisma carried him far in life, and when he met Sidney Rigdon in 1826, he saw his chance to do something that would affect the whole world. Rigdon was a Campbellite minister who had stolen copies of Solomon Spalding's unpublished "Manuscript Story" and "Manuscript Found" before Spalding had died in 1816. Using these two manuscripts as a guide, the two prepared a script for the Book of Mormon, which Joseph dictated to his wife, Oliver Cowdery, and Martin Harris from behind a sheet and inside a hat over the 63-day period often called a "miraculous translation."<br>  <br>  Rigdon finally made his way into the Church when Joseph Smith "had a hunch" that he should send missionaries to Ohio, where Rigdon had been preaching to his congregation of over 100 that God would "soon restore the fulness of the Gospel." Naturally, Rigdon led his whole congregation in being baptized, and within 30 days of his baptism, Rigdon became the second most authoritative man in the Church as Assistant President of the Church.<br>  <br>  As Joseph became increasingly rich and powerful later in Nauvoo, he built himself a Mansion House and began taking spiritual wives, without the knowledge of Emma for the first two years. He finally did send Hyrum, his brother, to tell Emma by reading her a "revelation" he had received. He was just across the street hiding, waiting for Hyrum to come back and tell him what she had said. Finally, when she conceded, he held marriage ceremonies with his previous plural wives a second time so that Emma wouldn't suspect anything.<br>  <br>  In Carthage, he removed his garments and instructed the other men with him to do the same. He kept on his person, however, a divinatory talisman that was believed to protect its bearer from harm.<br>  <br>  Aaahhhh yes, General Smith's legacy will live on a long time yet to come. He is an inspiration for closet adulterers and repressed farmboys everywhere.|`|AA10725805	I believe that he was a prophet of God.

ByInK8Mnaa	I think they are very good even though I don't agree with Lee on some of his theology. He takes a fair approach by asking all the hard questions you see atheists and skeptics ask. Also he picks some very good people to interview. Like myself Lee spent a good chunk of his life as an atheist. I think that gives him some much needed insight for his type of books.|`|EX6seQtiaa	Yes, I read "The Case for the Creator." I thought it was good, but incomplete.

However, I didn't think that he spent enough time going into  the details of the arguments that he had. Throughout his book(Case for Christ) I felt like this, he had a question, got an answer from an expert,  agreed-- once it was explained, and moved on to the next argument. I didn't feel like there was much of an intellectual discussion in the book. And even though he had presented his questions as though he was one of the skeptics, their side, I felt, was hardly defended. All in all, I wish that he didn't write the book as one huge interview; only putting in comments when he thought necessary, but more as a debate.<br>  <br>  Case for Faith(unless I'm confusing it with another book), I thought was  a lot better. He used  a lot more emotional appeal and testimonies to get his points across. There were also good analogies to drive his points home. My mind was kept amused for a good two hours. Very good.|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	Read Case for Christ.  Not very compelling at all.  Interesting to a point, sure, but not persuasive.|`|MVT34FZsaa	I have them.

dFJRg61Uaa	Unfortunately, modern Xtians don't know history or ancient cultures enough to figure out what was obvious to any reasonably awake First Century person.<br>  <br>  ADDENDUM Case in point a few posts below...<br>  <br>  For future reference, rather than desparate grasps at theologic straws to bolster an empty "mystery", try a little bit of know history, detailed for your convenience here:<br>  <br>  "A fragment from the oldest surviving copy of the New Testament shows that the number of the Beast of Revelation 13 is 616. Ellen Aitken, a professor of early Christian history at McGill University, states that “the majority opinion seems to be that it refers to [the Roman emperor] Nero.”1 The early fragment supports the view that Revelation was written prior to the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, and whether the number is 666 or 616, the number is a reference to Nero and not some end-time antichrist figure. Only time will tell how this discovery will affect dispensationalism.<br>  <br>  "The first readers of Revelation were told to “calculate the number of the Beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six” (13:18). Since Revelation was written to a first-century audience, we should expect the first-century readers to be able to calculate the number with relative ease and understand the result. They would have had few candidates from which to choose. Notice that the number is “six hundred and sixty-six, not three sixes.” Tim LaHaye misidentifies the number when he writes, “The plain sense of Scripture tells us that it comprises the numbers: six, six, six.”2 The three Greek letters that make up the number represent 600, 60, and 6.<br>  <br>  "Ancient numbering systems used an alpha-numeric method. This is true of the Latin (Roman) system that is still common today: I=1, V=5, X=10, L=50, C=100, D=500, M=1000. Greek and Hebrew follow a similar method where each letter of their alphabets represents a number. The first nine letters represent 1–9.3 The tenth letter represents 10, with the nineteenth letter representing 100 and so on. Since the Book of Revelation is written in a Hebrew context by a Jew with numerous allusions to the Old Testament, we should expect the solution to deciphering the meaning of six hundred and sixty-six to be Hebraic. "The reason clearly is that, while [John] writes in Greek, he thinks in Hebrew, and the thought has naturally affected the vehicle of expression."4<br>  <br>  "When Nero Caesar's name is transliterated into Hebrew, which a first-century Jew would probably have done, he would have gotten Neron Kesar or simply nrwn qsr, since Hebrew has no letters to represent vowels. “It has been documented by archaeological finds that a first century Hebrew spelling of Nero's name provides us with precisely the value of 666. Jastrow's lexicon of the Talmud contains this very spelling.”5 When we take the letters of Nero's name and spell them in Hebrew, we get the following numeric values: n=50, r=200, w=6, n=50, q=100, s=60, r=200 = 666. “Every Jewish reader, of course, saw that the Beast was a symbol of Nero. And both Jews and Christians regarded Nero as also having close affinities with the serpent or dragon. . . . The Apostle writing as a Hebrew, was evidently thinking as a Hebrew. . . . Accordingly, the Jewish Christian would have tried the name as he thought of the name—that is in Hebrew letters. And the moment that he did this the secret stood revealed. No Jew ever thought of Nero except as ‘Neron Kesar.’”6<br>  <br>  "The fragment supports the reading of some Greek New Testament manuscripts that read 616 instead of 666. Why would someone making a copy of the Revelation scroll make such a number change? “Perhaps the change was intentional, seeing that the Greek form Neron Caesar written in Hebrew characters (nrwn qsr) is equivalent to 666, whereas the Latin form Nero Caesar (nrw qsr) is equivalent to 616.” A Latin copyist might have thought that 666 was an error because Nero Caesar did not add up to 666 when transliterated into Latin. He then changed 666 to 616 to conform to the Latin rendering since it was generally accepted that Nero was the Beast. In either case, a Hebrew transliteration nets 666, while a Latin spelling nets 616. Nero was the “man” and either 666 or 616 was his number."|`|537547aded6cfac6dab669e1bb4493baaa	LOL!!!!!   Your ignorance is showing.  666 is the number of a man.  It is one short of completeness, which would be 777.  To attempt to attach that number to any individual or even to any particular period in time is pure ignorance. <br>  <br>  "Nobody might be able to buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast or the number of its name. Here is where wisdom comes in: Let the one that has intelligence calculate the number of the wild beast, for it is a man's number; and its number is six hundred and sixty-six."—Revelation 13:17, 18.<br>  <br>  Some believe that 666 is the mark of the Biblical antichrist. Others say that it signifies some form of compulsory identification, such as a tattoo or an implanted microchip with a digital code that identifies the person as a servant of the beast. Still others hold that 666 is the mark of the Catholic papacy. Substituting Roman numerals for the letters in a form of the pope's official title, Vicarius Filii Dei (Vicar of the Son of God), and manipulating the figures a little, they come up with 666. It is also claimed that the same number can be calculated from the Latin name of Roman Emperor Diocletian and from the Hebrew version of the name Nero Caesar.*<br>  <br>  These fanciful and contrived interpretations, however, are very different from what the Bible itself says about the mark of the beast. A clue to the meaning of 666 lies in its being "a man's number," or as The Amplified Bible puts it, "a human number." This expression could not refer to an individual human, for Satan—not any man—has authority over the beast. (Luke 4:5, 6; 1 John 5:19; Revelation 13:2, 18) Rather, the beast's having "a human number," or mark, suggests that it is a human entity, not spirit or demon, and that it therefore manifests certain human traits. What might they be? The Bible answers, saying: "All [humans] have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23) The beast's having "a human number," therefore, indicates that governments reflect the fallen human condition, the mark of sin and imperfection.<br>  History bears this out. "Every civilization that has ever existed has ultimately collapsed," said former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. "History is a tale of efforts that failed, of aspirations that weren't realized . . . So, as a historian, one has to live with a sense of the inevitability of tragedy." Kissinger's honest appraisal testifies to this fundamental Bible truth: "To earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step."—Jeremiah 10:23.<br>  <br>  Now that we have identified the beast and discerned how God views it, we are in a position to examine the final part of our puzzle—the number six and why it is written in triple digits—that is, 666, or 600 plus 60 plus 6.<br>  In the Scriptures, certain numbers have symbolic significance. The number seven, for example, is often used to symbolize that which is complete, or perfect, in God's eyes. For instance, God's creative week comprises seven 'days,' or extended time periods, during which God completely accomplishes his creative purpose regarding the earth. (Genesis 1:3–2:3) God's "sayings" are like silver that has been "clarified seven times," thus perfectly refined. (Psalm 12:6; Proverbs 30:5, 6) The leper Naaman was told to bathe seven times in the Jordan River, after which he was completely healed.—2 Kings 5:10, 14.<br>  <br>  Six is one short of seven. Would it not be a fitting symbol of something imperfect, or defective, in God's eyes? Yes, indeed! (1 Chronicles 20:6, 7) Moreover, six repeated three times, as 666, powerfully stresses that imperfection. That this is the correct view is supported by the fact that 666 is "a human number," as we have considered. Thus, the beast's record, its "human number," and the number 666 itself all point to one unmistakable conclusion—gross shortcoming and failure in the eyes of Jehovah.<br>  Immediately after disclosing the number 666, Revelation mentions 144,000 followers of the Lamb, Jesus Christ, who have his name and the name of his Father, Jehovah, written on their foreheads. These names identify the bearers as belonging to Jehovah and to his Son, about whom they proudly bear witness. Likewise, those having the mark of the beast proclaim their servitude to the beast. Thus, the mark, whether on the right hand or on the forehead, figuratively speaking, is a symbol that identifies its bearer as one who gives worshipful support to the beastlike political systems of the world. Those having the mark give to "Caesar" that which rightly belongs to God. (Luke 20:25; Revelation 13:4, 8; 14:1) How? By giving worshipful honor to the political state, its symbols, and its military might, to which they look for hope and salvation. Any worship that they render the true God is merely lip service.<br>  <br>  In contrast, the Bible urges us: "Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man, to whom no salvation belongs. His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish." (Psalm 146:3, 4) Those who heed that wise counsel are not disillusioned when governments fail to deliver on their promises or when charismatic leaders fall from grace.—Proverbs 1:33.<br>  <br>  So there is 666 in a nutshell.  BUT--- who will learn from reading it???|`|mF7bgDZZaa	Yes, I knew. <br>  However, there may be more to it than what is there. That's the hypothesis, anyway.

You can use google to find out about translation issues that debunk "hate verses". <br>  <br>  I actually found out about the translation issues when I went to a Christian college/seminary for two years. The professors in the bible department who regularly assist in translating Hebrew and Greek for bible printings told us about a lot of the issues (and they don't just cover GBLT grounds). <br>  <br>  The problem was that even though they knew for a fact what the translation issues were, they would never be allowed to teach in a church, because what they knew would never be accepted by a church.  What's more, is that the translations we read are voted on by committee due to the inability to directly translate some ideas into English. If you were to compare bible translations over the past hundred years, you will see proof of this in that parts are slightly changed, and sometimes entire blocks of text are taken out. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, you will find notes about parts that are changed, taken out, or debated in current bible printings.<br>  <br>  Lastly, what we know as the New Testament was actually a collection of writings that were floating around among believers for quite a while before they were gathered and voted on  several times in history as to which writings were more or less authentic. Believe it or not, Revelations almost didn't make it. <br>  <br>  Before that, the "original bible" for believers was what we now know as the Old Testament.

If you dont follow and agree with everything the pastors son said you were the fruit of the devil. If you<br>  If you did  not sign an agreement as a leader you couldnt be one. It included attendance to all services, you were not allowed to visit other churches, you were not allowed to sing/play/preach etc etc anywhere without written permission and you had to tell them in advance.

The pastors son could spend all the tithes, abuse his wife, sell other peoples items, Rip off his friends, be kicked out of his house over and over again for not paying rent, steal from his wife because she left him including robbing her car twice, Sell the churches possessions, lie about many things (serious lying issue), have chronic mental health issues. etc etc etc And steal be allowed to travel the world and preach, be given church money, be given the pastors house cause he had been kicked out of his, Be encouraged and blinded believed even though there was physical evidence of everything.

2tukLOanaa	The conch in Vishnu's hand stands for purity of speech, the discus or the wheel symbolizes the knowledge of the self (I am the soul, point of light) and of the world-wheel (cycle of 5000 years). The lotus represents purity of actions or uprightness of practical life and the spirit of detachment.The mace denotes victory over the five vices: sex-lust, anger, greed, attachment and arrogance. Two of the arms of Vishnu represent Shri Narayana and the rest two represent Shri Lakshmi. The crown of light is symbolic of piety and peace and the crown of gold, bedecked with jewels, is an emblem of sovereignty or prosperity. God Shiva exhorts mankind to adopt Vishnu as their ideal and if they do so, they would attain double-crowned sovereignty in Heaven. So, all those who receive Godly Knowledge and learn easy Sovereign Yoga through Prajapita Brahma, they make their spiritual endeavours with the object of being raised to the Double-crowned deity status, such as that of Shri Lakshmi and Shri Narayana. Having this ideal in view, they do righteous and virtuous deeds and work for complete purity.   www.bkwsu.org          www.brahmakumaris.org|`|6GQhvmJVaa	The lotus is symbolic of female reproductive organs.The rose is used in Rosicrucianism and is the sign of the order of the rosey cross.An FBI agent held one behind his back as a signal of an inside job in 1995 at the Murrah bomb site.Symbology is still important in the occult today.Hinduism is littered with gods and symbols.|`|fa6ffb4f84d07a7b43fa958da970b3e9aa	Answer by C.

The lotus is named in the Rigveda and is mentioned with increasing frequency in the later Samhitas. In the Atharvaveda the human heart is compared with the lotus, and the Panchavimsa Brahmana speaks of its flower being born of the light of the Constellations.  The holiest of flowers for Hindus, the beautiful lotus is symbolic of the true soul of an individual. It represents the being, which lives in turbid waters yet rises up and blossoms to the point of enlightenment. Mythologically speaking, lotus is also a symbol of creation, since Brahma, the creator came forth from the lotus that blooms from the navel of Vishnu. Lakshmi is also called Padma (lotus-hued) and Vishnu holding Lotus in his hands means he is always keeping Goddess Lakshmi with him. These are the reasons for Lord Vishnu holding Lotus in his hands and not any  other flower.-|`|ES3noBMlaa	Hello , just passing to see how it is going "religion" here<br>  In the french side , they never talk about Hinduism , and they always fight !<br>  Between christian , and Islam !<br>  <br>  Happy day|`|LZF76BLXaa	24 classical forms of Vishnu, which are distinguished from each other mainly by the arrangement of the four characteristic weapons of Vishnu in his four hands, viz.

Of course we strive for perfection 'like our creator', but we can NEVER be sinless, that's next to impossible. <br>  <br>  I do, however believe that if you proclaim to be a Christian, that you should hold yourself accountable & walk in what it is that you believe that God's Word says....whether or not you think someone is watching...even though another human eye may not see what you are doing...means nothing b/c at the end of the day..what you do..be it in the light, in the dark, in the "private"...God sees all & He is holding you accountable for your own actions. So prayerfully & with love...consider what I've shared with you. God bless.|`|B3fpwDasaa	Very good!  You are right on everything!!  I am a girl and I finally can hear someone say what the Bible says on husband and wife relationships.  Although, a women can speak up but her job is not to lead the relationship.  A women should present her point of view as a suggestion not a command.  When you preach to the lost one should say that they are a sinner and are bound for hell if they don't have faith in what Jesus did on the cross and repent of your sins.  I don't believe in a ''feel good message'' which doesn't convict you of things you have done wrong.  If you are preaching the Truth people won't like it!!  I have heard this from my friends when I say something they aren't supposed to be doing '' but I ask for forgiveness.''  If you do something you know you aren't supposed to be doing and turn around and say but I ask for forgiveness because God has to forgive me, He won't because it is not true repentence.  Sure Christians are going to screw up in life, but we don't ''try'' to do what is right.  We put our faith in Jesus to live through us and do the right things.  We will mess up in life but that is when God's mercy is extended to us and if we are truly sorry He will forgive.  Repent actually means to turn your back on.  You simply don't say sorry, you turn your back on your whole sin nature and refuse to participate in it.  I hope I helped.  I have learned alot from my pastor, my dad.  I am 14 by the way.|`|o6BDapZjaa	Teach?  Not much.<br>  <br>  Threaten with hell - all the time.  Promise ridiculous things like universal love and a caring community - constantly.  Teach?

We LDS minister every month to the lost.  We call it home teaching.  We are "assigned" 3 to 5 "families" and we visit them.  We do not choose who we visit, but we help them with their needs.  We serve them, IF they accept it, some do not.  <br>  <br>  For example yesterday, I went to a divorcee.  I had previously given her my riding mower and she was afraid to use it.  I did because she needed more than me.  She has a big yard.  I had to show her how to start it and get her use to it.  I waited till she cut the yard.<br>  <br>  I do not tell you to brag, I am just a man trying to serve in the way I feel Christ showed the example.  And it is hard, it takes my time.  I have two other family's that need me in different ways.  Service, getting out of yourself.  I find the ones that complain do not serve others, try it.|`|wUMDl0Gvaa	Teach and Christian are mutually exclusive terms.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outrageous-Idea-Christian-Scholarship/dp/0195122909/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222976516&sr=1-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Outrageous-Idea-Ch...</a><br>  <br>  But then "Physician, heal thyself" says it all.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Lost-Goddess-Teachings-Christians/dp/1400045940/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222976560&sr=1-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Lost-Goddess...</a>

15bfbfb60daf4d455307ce2545e6ac0aaa	Primeiro leia se é correto o que irá fazer:<br>  <br>  Como anjos podem ajudá-lo<br>  <br>  A PALAVRA de Deus confirma a existência de anjos. Ela nos diz que há milh?es dessas criaturas espirituais. Daniel, servo de Jeová Deus, teve uma vis?o de coisas celestiais, sobre a qual ele escreveu: “Mil vezes mil .?.?. ministravam [a Deus] e dez mil vezes dez mil ficavam de pé logo diante dele.” —?Daniel 7:10.<br>  <br>  Note que a declara??o de Daniel faz mais do que apenas informar-nos de que há muitos anjos. Ela indica também que os anjos ministram a Deus. S?o os seus servos. Em harmonia com isso, o salmista cantou: “Bendizei a Jeová, vós anjos seus, poderosos em poder, cumprindo a sua palavra, por escutardes a voz da sua palavra. Bendizei a Jeová, todos os exércitos seus, vós ministros seus, fazendo a sua vontade.” —?Salmo 103:20,?21.<br>  <br>  A Bíblia explica também que os anjos n?o come?aram sua vida como humanos na Terra. Jeová criou os anjos no céu mesmo antes de criar a Terra. Quando Deus ‘fundou a Terra, todos os filhos angélicos de Deus bradaram em aplauso’. —?Jó?38:4-7.<br>  <br>  Os anjos s?o criaturas espirituais —?invisíveis, poderosos, inteligentes. Na Bíblia, a palavra hebraica mal·’ákh e o termo grego ág·ge·los s?o traduzidos “anjo” quando se referem a uma criatura espiritual. Estas palavras ocorrem quase 400?vezes na Bíblia. Ambas têm o mesmo sentido, a saber, “mensageiro”.<br>  <br>  Encontros com anjos<br>  <br>  Os anjos certamente s?o mensageiros. Talvez conhe?a o relato bíblico a respeito da ocasi?o em que o anjo Gabriel apareceu a Maria. Ele lhe disse que, embora ela fosse virgem, teria um filho que deveria receber o nome de Jesus. (Lucas 1:26-33) Um anjo apareceu também a alguns pastores no campo. Ele anunciou: “Hoje vos nasceu na cidade de Davi um Salvador, que é Cristo, o Senhor.” (Lucas 2:8-11) De forma similar, anjos transmitiram mensagens a Agar, Abra?o, Ló, Jacó, Moisés, Gide?o, Jesus e a outros no registro bíblico. —?Gênesis 16:7-12; 18:1-5,?10; 19:1-3; 32:24-30; êxodo 3:1,?2; Juízes 6:11-22; Lucas 22:39-43; Hebreus?13:2.<br>  <br>  é digno de nota que todas essas mensagens transmitidas por anjos estavam em harmonia com a realiza??o dos propósitos de Deus e n?o necessariamente com os dos humanos envolvidos. Os anjos apareciam como representantes de Deus, segundo a vontade e o cronograma dele. N?o foram convocados por humanos.<br>  <br>  Devemos recorrer a anjos em busca de ajuda?<br>  <br>  é correto recorrer a anjos em ocasi?es de afli??o? Se for, desejaríamos saber o nome do anjo melhor habilitado para nos ajudar. Por isso, alguns livros comerciais alistam os supostos nomes de muitos anjos, junto com sua categoria, título e dever. Um livro alista os chamados “principais dez no céu”, os “anjos mais conhecidos no mundo ocidental”. Junto com a lista dá-se-lhe o conselho de que feche os olhos, repita vagarosamente o nome do anjo diversas vezes, respire fundo, devagar, e de que “se prepare para o possível contato com eles”.<br>  <br>  A Bíblia, em contraste, só nos dá o nome de dois dos anjos fiéis de Deus, Miguel e Gabriel. (Daniel 12:1; Lucas 1:26) é?possível que o motivo de se darem esses nomes seja o de mostrar que cada anjo é uma pessoa espiritual única com um nome, n?o apenas alguma energia ou for?a impessoal.<br>  <br>  é digno de nota que alguns anjos se negaram a revelar seu nome aos humanos. Quando Jacó perguntou a um anjo o nome dele, este n?o quis revelá-lo. (Gênesis 32:29) Certo anjo que se dirigiu a Josué, quando se lhe pediu que se identificasse, disse apenas que ele era o “príncipe do exército de Jeová”. (Josué 5:14) Quando os pais de Sans?o perguntaram a um anjo qual era seu nome, este disse: “Por que é que me perguntarias assim pelo meu nome, quando ele é maravilhoso?” (Juízes 13:17,?18) Por n?o fornecer uma lista dos nomes dos anjos, a Bíblia protege-nos contra atribuirmos indevida honra e adora??o a anjos. Conforme veremos, também n?o nos manda invocá-los.<br>  <br>  Invoca??o de Deus<br>  <br>  A Bíblia nos diz tudo o que precisamos saber sobre os assuntos no domínio espiritual. O?apóstolo Paulo escreveu: “Toda a Escritura é inspirada por Deus e proveitosa para ensinar, .?.?. a fim de que o homem de Deus seja plenamente competente, completamente equipado para toda boa obra.” (2?Timóteo 3:16,?17) Se Deus quisesse que soubéssemos os nomes de muitos anjos, ele os teria revelado na sua Palavra, a Bíblia. E?se Deus desejasse instruir-nos em como contatar anjos e falar com eles em ora??o, teria providenciado tal informa??o nas Escrituras.<br>  <br>  Em vez disso, Jesus Cristo ensinou: “Quando orares, entra no teu quarto particular, e, fechando a tua porta, ora a teu Pai que está em secreto .?.?. Portanto, tendes de orar do seguinte modo: ‘Nosso Pai nos céus, santificado seja o teu nome.’” (Mateus 6:6,?9) O?conceito bíblico é o seguinte: n?o devemos invocar anjos ou orar a eles, mas devemos chegar-nos em ora??o ao Criador dos anjos, o próprio Deus. Seu nome n?o é mistério, e n?o há necessidade de algum visionário revelá-lo. Embora se tenham feito tentativas de obscurecer o nome divino, ele aparece no registro bíblico mais de 7.000 vezes. Por exemplo, foi com referência ao Pai celestial que o salmista cantou: “Tu, cujo nome é Jeová, somente tu és o Altíssimo sobre toda a terra.” —?Salmo 83:18.<br>  <br>  Jeová nunca está ocupado demais para nos escutar, se nos dirigirmos a ele de forma correta em ora??o. A?Bíblia fornece-nos esta garantia: “Quanto a Jeová, seus olhos percorrem toda a terra, para mostrar a sua for?a a favor daqueles cujo cora??o é pleno para com ele.” —?2?Cr?nicas 16:9.<br>  <br>  Anjos e a moral<br>  <br>  Contrário ao que muitas vezes é apresentado na mídia, os anjos n?o julgam pessoas. Isto é apropriado, porque os anjos n?o est?o autorizados a julgar humanos. Jeová é “o Juiz de todos”, embora tenha “confiado todo o julgamento ao Filho”, Jesus Cristo. (Hebreus 12:23; Jo?o 5:22) No entanto, seria um engano presumir que os anjos sejam indiferentes a como nós levamos nossa vida. Jesus disse: “Surge alegria entre os anjos de Deus por causa de um pecador que se arrepende.” —?Lucas 15:10.<br>  <br>  Os anjos, porém, n?o s?o meros espectadores. No passado, serviram como executores, cumprindo os julgamentos de Deus. Por exemplo, Deus usou anjos contra os antigos egípcios. Segundo o Salmo 78:49, “foi enviar sobre eles sua ira ardente, fúria, e verbera??o, e afli??o, delega??es de anjos trazendo calamidade”. De forma similar, a Bíblia relata que, numa só noite, um único anjo destruiu 185.000 soldados assírios. —?2?Reis 19:35.<br>  <br>  Assim também no futuro, os anjos destruir?o aqueles que amea?am o bem-estar de outros por se negarem a se harmonizar com as normas justas de Deus. Jesus virá “com os seus anjos poderosos, em fogo chamejante, ao trazer vingan?a sobre os que n?o conhecem a Deus e os que n?o obedecem às boas novas”. —?2?Tessalonicenses?1:7,?8.<br>  <br>  As Escrituras mostram assim que os anjos fiéis de Deus sempre fazem a vontade dele por cumprir Suas instru??es e defender Suas normas justas. é?evidente que, se quisermos que os anjos de Deus nos ajudem, precisamos saber qual é a vontade de Deus e esfor?ar-nos seriamente em cumpri-la.<br>  <br>  Anjos da guarda<br>  <br>  Será que anjos cuidam de pessoas e as protegem? O?apóstolo Paulo perguntou: “N?o s?o todos [os anjos] espíritos para servi?o público, enviados para ministrar aos que h?o de herdar a salva??o?” (Hebreus 1:14) é?evidente que a resposta à pergunta de Paulo é sim.<br>  <br>  Os três hebreus, Sadraque, Mesaque e Abednego, por se negarem a se curvar diante duma imagem de ouro erigida pelo rei babil?nico Nabucodonosor, foram lan?ados numa fornalha superaquecida. No entanto, esses servos fiéis de Deus n?o foram tocados pelo fogo. Quando o rei olhou dentro da fornalha, ele viu “quatro var?es vigorosos” e disse que “a aparência do quarto [era] semelhante à de um filho dos deuses”. (Daniel 3:25) Alguns anos mais tarde, Daniel viu-se numa cova de le?es por causa da sua fidelidade. Ele também escapou ileso e declarou: “Meu próprio Deus enviou seu anjo e fechou a boca dos le?es.” —?Daniel 6:22.<br>  <br>  Com a forma??o da congrega??o dos seguidores de Cristo no primeiro século?EC, novamente apareceram anjos, libertando os apóstolos da pris?o. (Atos 5:17-24; 12:6-12) E?quando a vida de Paulo estava em perigo no mar, um anjo assegurou-lhe que ele chegaria a salvo a Roma. —?Atos 27:13-24.<br>  <br>  Os atuais servos de Jeová est?o plenamente convencidos de que as invisíveis for?as angélicas de Deus s?o reais e s?o capazes de dar prote??o, assim como deram a Eliseu e seu ajudante. (2?Reis 6:15-17) Deveras, “o?anjo de Jeová acampa-se ao redor dos que o temem, e?ele os socorre”. —?Salmo 34:7;?91:11.<br>  <br>  A mensagem trazida por anjos<br>  <br>  Ao passo que os anjos se preocupam com o bem-estar dos que servem a Jeová Deus, eles também est?o envolvidos em cuidar de que as pessoas aprendam algo sobre Ele e Seu propósito. O?apóstolo Jo?o escreveu: “Eu vi outro anjo voando pelo meio do céu, e ele tinha boas novas eternas para declarar, como boas notícias aos que moram na terra, e a toda na??o, e tribo, e língua, e povo, dizendo com voz alta: ‘Temei a Deus e dai-lhe glória.’?” —?Revela??o (Apocalipse) 14:6,?7.<br>  <br>  Deseja saber quais s?o estas “boas novas eternas”? Neste caso, pergunte às Testemunhas de Jeová. Elas ter?o prazer em informá-lo.|`|7Yf3YnkDaa	??????????????????|`|PIMvILQiaa	No planalto !?

Se falando desta maneira, se entende que voce entrou em sua casa e foi em algum lugar dentro dela, como se fosse um automóvel. O correto é "vou para minha casa".A maior gafe que presen?iei, foi em uma cola??o de grau de formandos em "Letras". O orador dos formandos, escreveu e leu a seguinte frase: Agente hoje está aqui para...etc. A palavra "agente" é uma gíria. Um erro inadmissivel em quem está se formando em Letras. Este orador é amigo meu.Logo após ele dizer esta frase, ele mesmo na hora viu que cometeu uma gafe acadêmica. Mas, para evitar esta que é maior gafe de nós Brasileiros, é se aprofundar mais no Português, e quando falar, falar pausadamente, mentalizando antes o que vai dizer.

UqigwVV6aa	De alguna forma Kania, los seres humanos -sin darnos cuenta- nos estamos auto-clasificando o categorizando cuando nos incluímos en un grupo u otro... <br>  Has observado bien, esta gente es muy posiblemente gente de bajo nivel educativo, bajo nivel económico, inseguros, temerosos, no están acostumbrados a leer, razonar, pensar y tampoco pueden porque no se han alimentado bien durante sus vidas... <br>  Lo atroz de todo esto, no es que ellos siendo así, crean y busquen a Dios, lo atroz es que siempre habrá alguien más listo que ellos que les engolocine con mentiras... <br>  Es terrible que nos estemos dividiendo así, en lugar de unirnos... pero el ser humano lo que busca es lo que entiende y lo que le da seguridad en un mundo tan inseguro como el que vivimos... ellos realmente no tienen otro lugar al cuál recurrir... Te los imaginas en un curso pre-bautismal o tratando de entender lo que es el pecado original?<br>  Lo que les dan ahí es sencillo, seguro, fácil de entender y asimilar... les da mucha seguridad, eso es todo.<br>  No sé qué se podría hacer al respecto...

La verdadera fe no es un fundamentalismo ciego y absurdo... es un conocimiento correcto y verdadero, es un sentimiento de confianza plena fundamentado en el razonamiento y utilización de nuestra capacidad de pensar. <br>  <br>  La Biblia nos anima a adquirir conocimiento, a asegurarnos de las cosas, a mantener una fe alimentada por obras. No se trata de ser oidores olvidadizos, no se trata de solamente decir "tengo fe". Se trata de transformarnos rehaciendo nuestra mente para entender nuestra existencia como un todo, como un presente con propósito para el futuro. (Romanos 12:2).<br>  <br>  A.|`|iQFXhNmjaa	Pues desde mi punto de vista la religion siempre ha sido pretexto y excusa para todo el mundo paises en guerra en nombre de la religion, pastores/curas abusan de ni?os en nombre de su religion, personas se dejan morir en nombre de su religion, en fin yo creo que la religion estos dias solo tiene a dios como pretexto para hacer lo que se le de la gana o para no hacer nada de plano. Yo te recomendaria que te preocupes tu por no caer en lo mismo y no dejar que alguien regule tu vida con ideas que no son las tuyas.

Suerte.|`|58610ddfecb6d670036eb1923050ace6aa	Hola, Dios nos dice en la Biblia "ayudate que yo te ayudare", el problema con mucha gente es que no son espirituales son religiosos, el orar por todo no es malo pero necesitamos orar con fe, Dios dice en su palabra "las obras sin fe son obras muertas. De nada sirve orar por un trabajo y no buscarlo, o de orar por la familia y no hablarles de la palabra de Dios. Ponte en las manos de Dios para que te de entendimiento y no dejes que el diablo te confunda. Dios te bendiga.|`|759aa7654be2d1b764f5367b103e3382aa	Fe cristiana: Para elcristiano verdadero, la fe no es estática, sino activa, creciente. (2 Tesalonicenses 1:3) De ahí que fuera apropiada la petición de los discípulos de Jesús: "Danos más fe", y que él les permitiera aumentarla, aportándoles más pruebas y entendimiento sobre los cuales basarla (Lucas 17:5).<br>  Debe haber obras que estén en armonía con esa fe y que la manifiesten (Santaigo 2:21-26). Las situaciones adversas resultan en un fortalecimiento de la fe, y esta sirve como un escudo protector en la guerra espiritual del cristiano, ayudándole a derrotar al Diablo y vencer al mundo (1 Pedro 1:6,7; Efesios 6:16; 1 Pedro 5:9; 1 Juan 5:4).<br>  No obstante, la fe no se puede dar por sentada, pues su carencia es "el pecado que fácilmente nos enreda". Mantener una fe firme requiere luchar tenazmente por ella, resistir a aquellas personas que podrían sumir a un cristiano en la inmoralidad, combatir las obras de la carne, evitar el lazo del materialismo, mantenerse alejado de las filosofías y tradiciones de los hombres que destruyen la fe y, sobre todo, mirar "atentamente al Agente Principal y Perfeccionador de nuestra fe, Jesús". (Hebreos 12:1,2).<br>  Los cristianos debemos ser personas activas, trabajadoras,<br>  (Romanos 12:11), esforzarnos por hacer la voluntad de Dios con la confianza en que Dios nos protege y nos da las fuerzas para resistir las dificultades del mundo de Satanás. (Filipenses 4:6,7; 4:13; 1 Pedro 5:8,9)|`|DpP2cmX2aa	hay un dicho por ahi,que dice ayudate que yo te ayudare,segun yo significa,que no debes dejar todo a la mano e dios,y que tu mismo debes de decidir que es lo que quieres ser o lograr.|`|W9NIqiTpaa	El problema es más complejo. No es nada más decir que "la religión es el opio de los pueblos" y ya. Hay que tener cuidado porque también se ha popularizado la postura de ser "ateo", porque Nietsche y Marx y demás han hecho fuertes críticas, y de repente resulta que el que "no cree en dios" es más inteligente que el que sí.<br>  <br>  Hay que saber distinguir entre 2 cosas: la religión y las instituciones religiosas. Princesa # 1 bien diferenció entre ser espirituales y ser religiosos. Creo que todos debemos ser espirituales, es decir, tener nuestra alma en comunión con las de los demás y el mundo que nos rodea, y demás fuerzas que puedan existir, llámalas como quieras (Dios, Energía, etc.). A esto le puedes poner la etiqueta y postura que mejor se ajuste a tu vida, y puedes decir ser musulmán, cristiano, católico, evangélico, budista, o lo que sea mejor para ti. Entonces puedes ser religioso.<br>  <br>  La situación real con la gran proliferación de nuevas denominaciones religiosas es que se fundan sobre problemáticas sociales complejas, sobre los vacíos que tiene nuestra sociedad, vacíos sociales, morales, económicos, etc. Entonces, si por ejemplo, tú eres católico pero pobre, el catolicismo ya no te resulta una solución. Pero vienen otros a jugar con tus sentimientos y frustraciones y te VENDEN la salvación. No te ofrecen mejor vida, pero te garantizan la mejor muerte y vida eterna. A esto súmale el poder del sentimiento de culpa (muy difundido por el Catolicismo) que nos hace sentir pecadores en todo momento, además de esa triste sensación de ser observados y calificados en todo momento, entonces la gente busca una salida desesperada. Entran en juego muchas más cosas, como que esta gente no tiene amor a Dios, sino temor, así que pareciera que si no mencionan a Cristo en todo momento y lo llevan en la playera y pintan alabanzas en las paredes de sus casas y negocios y cantan y bailan sus canciones, etc., entonces éste va a decidir no salvarlos. Al final es más fácil echarle la culpa a Dios y al Diablo (nótese que le pongo las mismas mayúsculas a ambos) que responsabilizarse de sus propios actos, como bien dices.|`|pVN87bswaa	Estas en las manos del Se?or, que El te de claridad a tu mente.<br>  Dios te bendiga|`|v9YcciBsaa	no debemos de dar la interpretacion literalmente a estas preguntas por que tu dice si no tienes trabajo se lo dejo en manos de Dios en lugar de buscar un trabajo, pero aqui lo que debes hacer es orar y claro pedirle a Dios que te prospere no es que se lo dejes todo a el y tu no hagas nada si no que el te proveera de lo necesario incluyendo un buen trabajo.|`|HYByHIe0aa	que te pasa de eso se trata, ese es un tipico sintoma de lavado cerebral para sacar billetes uste no se fije.. no me convienen sus palabras..<br>  ven a mi templo evangelico, se siente muy bonito,el maximo nivel es el supersayayin anticatolico, un librito que hay que memorizarse con mil calumnias y ataques contra catolicos.

AA11412999	I don't think it's a matter of men being generally insecure; it's just that most often, it's the man's idea.  For whatever reason, men tend to be the ones who bring it up first, and it's the woman who is the more conservative of the two.  This is NOT always the case.  <br>  <br>  When they get started, the man finds himself suddenly realizing that fantasy and reality are more different than he had anticipated.  And while his female partner is fully embracing the liberty that swinging affords her, he's saying, OK, maybe we should think about this a little more, hon...After all, we don't want to rush into anything, right?  <br>  <br>  It really is a woman's world, and the husband who is most successful at swinging is the one who would give his left lugnut just to see that glow on his woman's face.  He's just happy to be there!|`|jsxphZJEaa	Yes, this is almost always the case when you hear this subject discussed.

If a couple is happy with each other and happy with 'entering the swinging world' then this is rarely a problem. I believe too many couples begin swinging as they believe it will make them a stronger couple, often, but not always, this goes the complete opposite way. With bigger cracks forming in the relationship. <br>  <br>  I suppose why a man might feel uncomfortable after going into swinging is seeing his partner get 'all the fun' or receiving more attention. There appears to be, and almost definitely is, alot more single blokes 'on scene' compared to single females. I can understand why a man could feel abit jealous because of the number of guys interested in his partner.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  take care<br>  x|`|fKeJfgFoaa	Sounds right. Probably the guy starts feeling anxious about seeing the girl having fun, but the girl once she is having fun has no reason to stop.

fa6ffb4f84d07a7b43fa958da970b3e9aa	For the one who naturally sees the world as real the path to follow is Karmayog (the path of action). For the one who naturally sees the self as real the path to follow is Gyanyog (the path of knowledge/discrimination).For the one who naturally sees God as real the path to follow is Bhaktiyog (the path of devotion).<br>  <br>  Karmayog - Renouncing selfish desire and the attraction for pleasures and prosperity serve everybody. Sensual pleasure is experienced by animals also. As humans, your goal should be to help all - do whatever you can to the best of your ability so that everybody benefits.<br>  <br>  In the Bhaagwat also these three paths are given for the one who wants salvation. The world has to be renounced. You enjoy pleasures and spoil your habit. Serve others and purify your self. If you accept the world as real - serve. In the path of knowledge the world is unreal.

As stated in the brahma-samhita (5.38), <br>  premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena: Only those who have smeared their eyes with the ointment of love of godhead can see everywhere the supreme lord face to face; it is not possible by imagination or so-called meditation."<br>  <br>  Premanja-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena<br>  santa-sadaiva-hrdyesu-vilokayanti<br>  yam syamasundaram..<br>  <br>  See the mentioning of the word santa - saint by Lord Brahma, intermediary creator of this creation himself saying  that one whose eyes are anointed with the ointment of loving devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is a santa - saint......<br>  <br>  GURU:<br>  <br>  "In the Padma Purān?a, the characteristics of the guru, the bona fide spiritual master, have been described:<br>  <br>  mahā-bhāgavata-?res?t?ho brāhman?o vai gurur nr?n?ām<br>  sarves?ām eva lokānām asau pūjyo yathā harih?<br>  mahā-kula-prasūto 'pi sarva-yaj?es?u dīks?itah?<br>  sahasra-?ākhādhyāyī ca na guruh? syād avais?n?avah?<br>  <br>  The guru must be situated on the topmost platform of devotional service. There are three classes of devotees, and the guru must be accepted from the topmost class. The first-class devotee is the spiritual master for all kinds of people. It is said, gurur nr?n?ām. The word nr?n?ām means "of all human beings." The guru is not limited to a particular group. It is stated in the Upade?āmr?ta of Rūpa Gosvāmī that a guru is a gosvāmī, a controller of the senses and the mind. Such a guru can accept disciples from all over the world. Pr?thivīm? sa ?is?yāt. This is the test of the guru.<br>  <br>  In India there are many so-called gurus, and they are limited to a certain district or a province. They do not even travel about India, yet they declare themselves to be jagad-guru, the guru of the whole world. Such cheating gurus should not be accepted. Anyone can see how the bona fide spiritual master accepts disciples from all over the world. The guru is a qualified brāhman?a; therefore he knows Brahman and Parabrahman. He thus devotes his life for the service of Parabrahman. The bona fide spiritual master who accepts disciples from all over the world is also worshiped all over the world because of his qualities. Lokānām asau pūjyo yathā harih?: the people of the world worship him just as they worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All these honors are offered to him because he strictly follows the brahminical principles and teaches these principles to his disciples. Such a person is called an ācārya because he knows the principles of devotional service, he behaves in that way himself, and he teaches his disciples to follow in his footsteps. Thus he is an ācārya or jagad-guru. Even though a person is born in a brahminical family and is very expert in performing sacrifices, he cannot be accepted as a guru if he is not a strict Vais?n?ava. A guru is a brāhman?a by qualification, and he can turn others into brāhman?as according to the ?āstric principles and brahminical qualifications. <br>  Brahmanism is not a question of heredity. In ?rīmad-Bhāgavatam (7.11.35) ?rī Nārada Muni tells Mahārāja Yudhis?t?hira what a brāhman?a is. He states that if brahminical qualifications are observed in ks?atriyas, vai?yas or even ?ūdras, one should accept them as brāhman?as. In this regard, ?rīla ?rīdhara Svāmī has commented: ?amādibhir eva brāhman?ādi-vyavahāro mukhyah?, na jāti-mātrādīty āha — yasyeti. yad yadi anyatra varn?āntare 'pi dr??yeta, tad-varn?āntaram? tenaiva laks?an?a-nimittenaiva varn?ena vinirdi?et, na tu jāti-nimittenety arthah?: "The most important criterion for deciding whether to deal with someone as a brāhman?a or as a member of another varn?a is the presence or absence of self-control and similar brahminical qualities. We should not judge primarily according to superficial characteristics like birth. This is stated in the verse beginning yasya [Bhāg. 7.11.35]. If the qualities of one varn?a are seen in someone born in another, he should be designated according to the varn?a of his qualities, not that of his birth."<br>  <br>  There is a similar statement made by Nīlakan?t?ha, a commentator on the Mahābhārata: ?ūdro 'pi ?amādy-upeto brāhman?a eva brāhman?o 'pi kāmādy-upetah? ?ūdra eva. "Although one may be born in a ?ūdra family, if he is endowed with the brahminical qualities, beginning with ?ama [control of the mind], he is to be accepted as a brāhman?a. Although one may be born in a brāhman?a family, if he is endowed with the qualities beginning with kāma [lust], he is to be considered a ?ūdra." No one should present himself as a brāhman?a simply on the basis of being born in a brahminical family. One must be qualified by the brahminical qualities mentioned in the ?āstras, particularly the Bhagavad-gītā (18.42):<br>  <br>  ?amo damas tapah? ?aucam? ks?āntir ārjavam eva ca<br>  j?ānam? vij?ānam āstikyam? brahma-karma svabhāva-jam<br>  <br>  "Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, knowledge, wisdom and religiousness — these are the natural qualities by which the brāhman?as work."<br>  <br>  Unless one is qualified with all these attributes, he cannot be accepted as a brāhman?a. It is not a question of simply taking birth in a brāhman?a family. In this regard, ?rīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī T?hākura remarks that Narottama dāsa T?hākura and ?yāmānanda Gosvāmī, although not born in brāhman?a families, are accepted as bona fide spiritual masters because they were brāhman?as by qualification. Personalities like ?rī Gańgā-nārāyan?a, Rāmakr?s?n?a and many others, who were actually born in brāhman?a families, accepted Narottama dāsa T?hākura and ?yāmānanda Gosvāmī as their spiritual masters.<br>  When one has attained the topmost position of mahā-bhāgavata, he is to be accepted as a guru and worshiped exactly like Hari, the Personality of Godhead. Only such a person is eligible to occupy the post of a guru. However, if one is highly qualified but is not a Vais?n?ava, he cannot be accepted as a guru. One cannot be a brāhman?a unless one is a Vais?n?ava. If one is a Vais?n?ava, he is already a brāhman?a. If a guru is completely qualified as a Vais?n?ava, he must be accepted as a brāhman?a even if he is not born in a brāhman?a family. <br>  The caste system method of distinguishing a brāhman?a by birth is not acceptable when applied to a bona fide spiritual master. A spiritual master is a qualified brāhman?a and ācārya. If one is not a qualified brāhman?a, he is not expert in studying the Vedic literatures. Nānā-?āstra-vicāran?aika-nipun?au. Every Vais?n?ava is a spiritual master, and a spiritual master is automatically expert in brahminical behavior. He also understands the Vedic ?āstras.<br>  <br>  Similarly, a disciple's qualifications must be observed by the spiritual master before he is accepted as a disciple. ......"<br>  <br>  So, that is the difference between a Guru and a saint. Actually a true saint is also a guru. In absolute platform, there is no difference. But a guru can accept disciples and has a big responsibility of sending all of his disciples back to the Land of SriKrishna, Goloka Vrindavana, the HeadQuarters of Vaikunta<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Srinivas Kumar<br>  www. radhashyamsundar.com<br>  www.folknet.in|`|et8dSK2raa	Only a true saint can be somebody's Guru because he has been through everything and reached that destination which the saadhak aspires to reach|`|63WiSeT2aa	"Saint" means different things to different people. I think that the meaning you mean is an enlightened man or woman.<br>  Guru means a spiritual teacher who one devotes their life to. So if you are going to devote your life to a Guru, that person should be a saint, or enlightened being. For example, Ramakrishna was a Guru and also a saint. Nissargadatta, Vivekenanda etc are other examples of Guru/saints.

Se vc pegar o verso isoladamente, ele pode ser interpretado como que Paulo estivesse dizendo que os Crist?os que esperam em Cristo s?o Miseráveis. POrém, se vc utilizar a regra da Hermeneutica, que é a interpreta??o dentro do contexto, vc vai entender perfeitamente, que Paulo esta conjecturando, a respeito dos que dizem n?o existir a ressurrei??o da vida, e se de fato ela n?o existisse, apesar dele crer que exista, ai desta forma os que cressem em Cristo ou esperasse nEle nesta vida estariam sendo miseráveis. Portanto Leia os versos anteriores de I Corintios 15.<br>  <br>  12 Ora, se se prega que Cristo ressuscitou dentre os mortos, como dizem alguns dentre vós que n?o há ressurrei??o de mortos?<br>  13 E, se n?o há ressurrei??o de mortos, também Cristo n?o ressuscitou.<br>  14 E, se Cristo n?o ressuscitou, logo é v? a nossa prega??o, e também é v? a vossa fé.<br>  15 E assim somos também considerados como falsas testemunhas de Deus, pois testificamos de Deus, que ressuscitou a Cristo, ao qual, porém, n?o ressuscitou, se, na verdade, os mortos n?o ressuscitam.<br>  16 Porque, se os mortos n?o ressuscitam, também Cristo n?o ressuscitou.<br>  17 E, se Cristo n?o ressuscitou, é v? a vossa fé, e ainda permaneceis nos vossos pecados.<br>  18 E também os que dormiram em Cristo est?o perdidos.<br>  19 Se esperamos em Cristo só nesta vida, somos os mais miseráveis de todos os homens.<br>  20 Mas de fato Cristo ressuscitou dentre os mortos, e foi feito as primícias dos que dormem.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lendo todo o contexto percebemos claramente que Paulo afirmou o que vc citou dentro de uma conjectura, de condi??es ( Se ).<br>  <br>  Tj costumam usar incorretamente esta passagem e fora do contexto para confudir as pessoas.

Tu pregunta es una cuestion de fe. La fe es la certeza de lo que se espera, la conviccion de lo que no se ve.  La Biblia, esta compuesta de lo que se le llama el Antiguo Testamento o Pacto, pues como la Biblia lo establece, Dios es un Dios de Pactos y Convenios ya sea a nivel personal o aun a nivel  nacional.  Este Antiguo Testamento se compone de tres tipos de escritos si se agruparan por tipo de contenido, 1) La Torah palabra Hebrea que quiere decir "Ley" 2) Nevi'im palabra Hebrea para "Los Profetas" y 3) Kethuvin, palabra Hebrea para "Los Escritos" ej. Los Salmos, Proverbios etc.<br>  <br>  La Biblia en su segunda division mayor contiene lo que es conocido como el Nuevo Testamento o Pacto. Esta segunda division contiene tambien tres clases de escritos. 1. Historicos (Mateo, Marcos, Lucas, Juan, Hechos) 2. Profeticos y 3. Escritos (Cartas a las Iglesias en Corinto, en Roma, Efeso etc)<br>  <br>  Si tu escribieses de mi lo que tu quisieres escribir y lo lee un nieto mio, el tendria el criterio para juzgarme aunque yo ya no estuviere presente por: 1) Mi Testimonio 2) Mi reputacion en vida 3) lo vivido por los nietos y sus propias experiencias en cuanto a mi persona 4) lo que transmitieran mis hijos y ahora padres de mis nietos.<br>  <br>  La Biblia es tal vez el unico escrito que acevera que es inspirado por Dios.  Considera este pasaje escrito por un Discipulo de Mesias prometido por los escritos del Antiguo Testamento que puedes encontrar en la seccion Nueva Testamentaria de la Biblia.  "Y asi que tenemos la palabra profetica mas segura, a la cual haceis bien en prestar atencion como a una lampara que brilla en el lugar oscuro, hasta que el dia despunte y el lucero de la ma?ana aparezca en vuestros corazones.  Pero ante todo sabed esto, que ninguna profecia de la Escritura es asunto de interpretacion personal, pues ninguna profecia fue dada, jamas por un acto de voluntad humana, sino que hombres inspirados por el Espiritu Santo hablaron de parte de Dios"  Segunda Carta de Pedro Capitulo 1 verson 19, 20 y 21.<br>  <br>  Otro pasaje resa asi: "Toda Escritura es inspirada por Dios y util para ense?ar, para reprender, para corregir, para instruir en justicia, a fin de que el hombre de Dios sea perfecto, equipado para toda buena obra" Escrito por Pablo en su segunda carta a Timoteo para disceminacion a las iglesias Capitulo 3 verso 16.<br>  <br>  Si, si me consta que todo lo que dice la Biblia es verdad.|`|KnYGakXBaa	te la voy a rajar men, segun los historiadores romanos todos las fechas descritas en la biblia son ciertas, ademas los registros judios los respaldan, si no fuese asi que necesidad hubiera tenido un ser humano crear un documento de semejante indole, y si no fuese cierto lo que dice, pues lo que es mas cierto es que existe alguien con un gran intelecto que se nos adelanto a todos y escribio en esas paginas todo lo que tu conoces antes de que lo conocieras tu o tus abuelos. asi que mi respuesta es que si, aunque las de ahora estan adulteradas para comercializar la fe, asi que cree en que hay un DIOS que no le gusta el mal, solo el bien el amor y la comprension y al darnos el libre albendrio fue para que eligieramos que queriamos hacer si el bien o el mal y no juzgarle por las catastrofes mundiales, pues desde que el creo el mundo y lo ordeno el mundo fue perfecto fue la voluntad del hombre quein lo ha ido destruyendo, pues lo vemos en la capa de ozono, estaba completa antes y por que ahora tiene un agujero?...<br>  bueno mop fue un placer si te gusto dejame una estrella|`|f3fa107d6280918ae4d75542fdeb2c88aa	no me consta que todo lo que haya en la biblia sea cierto, ya que pudo haber sido bien alterada.<br>  Pero creo que hay ense?anzas que si las practicaran todos los humanos viviriamos en un mundo mucho pero mucho mejor....no les parece?|`|YxZLUcxpaa	No me consta, las biblias actuales están muy adulteradas, mejor cree en tí.|`|23WZTQOZaa	Crees tu en el arbol genealogico de tu familia ? como ? si no estuviste ahi !!|`|196827277acd6bf0e39f26fd2a3e4af0aa	ni me consta ni creo|`|4M9bjeK4aa	Creo hasta donde esté bien traducida|`|581b8fd44f32b4c101b01c0e5957f761aa	yo se que a constanza le puede constar,pero yo no soy constanza!!|`|yRmwe9D0aa	sí, como me consta que plutón ya no es un planeta. de acuerdo a tu "brillante" planteamiento, habría que ir a plutón para corroborar el hecho. la fe, como el hecho de que plutón ya no es un planeta, es un acto de confianza en quien lo afirma...

Her walk and general appearance makes men take that second look and even want to approach her, if they don't .  The comments of others often expresses their own insecurities and lack of self-confidence.  That's why they need to bring others to their level. The average women who believes she is something is greater than the beauty queen who hides behind her looks to escape her insecurities.|`|ypaqEC6gaa	confident versus arrogance = they aren't doing it right!!!|`|1736487e2716042c2489c9e602de31a4aa	true beauty is on d inside & y r u trying 2 fit in when maybe u were born 2 stand out
tGUPNrE0aa	Purnjanam is not cycle of Rebirth but life after death.<br>  The common word used for the Doctrine of Rebirth is ‘Punarjanam’. In Sanskrit Punar or Puna means ‘next time’ or ‘again’ and Janam means ‘life’. Therefore Punarjanam means next life or the life here after. It does not means coming to life again and again. Most of the reference for Punarjanam in the other Hindu Scriptures besides the Vedas if read keeping life hereafter in mind including the quotation of Bhagavad Gita and Upanishad it give us a concept of next life or life again but not life again and again. This concept of Rebirth again and again was developed later on after the vedic period to rationalize the indifferences found in different individuals at birth and different surrounding in which people live. Since the creator Almighty can not be unjust.<br>  Islam has a rational answer to this which we shall discuss later Insha Allah.<br>  Life after death in the Vedas<br>  There is reference to life after death in the Vedas. It’s mentioned in a. Rigveda Book No. 10, Hymn No. 16, Verse No. 4<br>  “The unborn portion; burn that, AGNI, with thy heat; let thy flame, thy splendour, consume it; with those glorious members which thou has given him, JATAVEDAS, bear him to the world (of the virtuous)”<br>  The Sanskrit word Sukritam u Lokam means the world of the virtuous or region of the pious, referring to the hereafter. The next Verse i.e.<br>  b. Rigveda, Book 10 Hymn 16, Verse 5 says.<br>  “…Putting on (celestial) life, let the remains (of bodily life) depart let him, JATAVEDAS be associated with a body.”<br>  This Verse too refers to a second life i.e. life after death.<br>  Paradise-Swarga in the Vedas.<br>  Swarg i.e. Paradise is described in several places in the Vedas including <br>  Atharvaveda, Book 4, Hymn 34, Verse 6 (Devichand)<br>  a. “May all these streams of butter, with their banks of honey, flowing with distilled water, and milk and curds and water reach thee in domestic life enhancing thy pleasure. May thou acquire completely these things strengthening the soul in diverse ways.”<br>  It’s mentioned in<br>  a. Atharvaveda, Book 4, Hymn 34, Verse 6 (Ved pra.)<br>  “Having pools of clarified butter, stocks of sweet honey, and having exhilarating drinks for water, full of milk and curds, may all these streams flew to us in the world of happiness swelling sweetly. May our lakes full of Lotuses be situated near us”.<br>  b. Its mentioned in<br>  Atharvaveda, Book 4, Hymn 34, Verse 2<br>  “Bereft of physical bodies, pure, cleansed with the wind, brilliant, they go to a brilliant world. The fire does not cause burning in their male organ. In the world if happiness they get plenty of women”.<br>  c. Its mentioned in<br>  Atharvaveda, Book 2, Hymn 34, Verse 5<br>  May the realized ones, first of all, take the vital breath under their control from the limbs in which it has been circulating. Go to heaven, stay firm with all the parts of your body Attain the world of light and emancipation, following the path of the enlightened ones, (your predecessors).<br>  d. It is mentioned in<br>  Atharvaveda, Book 6, Hymn 122, Verse 3.<br>  “O both of you, start to accomplish it; make determined effort to accomplish it. Those having unflinching faith attain this abode of happiness. Whatever ripe offerings you have made in fire of sacrifice may both, the husband and wife, stand united to guard them with care”.<br>  e. It is mentioned in<br>  Rigveda, Book 10, Hymn 95, Verse 18<br>  “O Aila, the loud-sounding clouds, these divines say to you, since you are indeed subject to death, let your progeny propitiate your revered cosmic forces with oblations, then alone you shall rejoice (with me) in heaven”<br>  Hell-Nark in the vedas<br>  Nark or Hell is also described in the Vedas and the Sanskrit word used is ‘Narakasthanam’.<br>  It is mentioned in<br>  Rigveda, Book 4, Hymn 5, Verse 4<br>  “May the bounteous fire-divine, consume them with his fiercely glowing sharp jaws like flames, who disregard the commandments and steadfast laws of most venerable and sagacious lord”.|`|AA12346187	No|`|3NDYC91Zaa	Sanjay  read my web site and see how I came to the knowledge that it is very possible<br>  <a href="http://members.aol.com/theasender" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/theasender</a>|`|c4915188681351ae48e3e8dbbb67e2baaa	Yes!

OG24Wg56aa	Very good point matey. No, the sky is not made out of water, and a woman was not made out of just a rib (you clearly can't put together a vagina out of just bone). So therefore it is safe to say that one should not read the bible really at all. It is a dilusional assortment of silly stories that mislead people. It is also obvious that the people who wrote the bible were severly ignorant. Only a person with an IQ of 40 could look at a bucket of water and directly correlate it with the sky. All we can do now is feel sorry for those people who lived thousands of years ago, and be glad that we are not that dumb. And we can laugh at them too because we have the internet, and they didn't.|`|1ushlLQMaa	I have only been a Christian for one day and can tell you that the Bible contains metaphors, as well as literal messages. For example, read the Book of Revelation. <br>  <br>  Secondly, His message was taught to people through the method of 'storytelling'. Think about how Christ Jesus taught those who were in His presence, He did it in parables (or metaphors); so that the listener would be fully engaged in the lesson and think deeply about what He was telling them.<br>  <br>  Rationalizing is not bad, in and of itself; the problem comes when those rationalizations turn into church doctrines, rules, or regulations. But if you use your understanding of scriptures, in a way of sharing with others your understanding, of certain pieces of scripture; this builds people up. Because, it brings about new insights to passages people read everyday. <br>  <br>  Finally, as we grow in our relationship and spiritual understanding of God and His Word, we learn to distinguish literal from total metaphor. Why do you think it is possible to reference between New and Old Testament? God had it planned already that we would learn of Him in this fashion. Look back at the Old Testament message and we find Moses lifting up a pole with a bronze snake on it, for the people to gaze upon for healing of their sins. <br>  <br>  Do you think he was telling them to worship the snake? No, the pole Moses held up (with the bronze snake) was a "metaphor" at the time; for the "literal" crucifixion of Christ Jesus. He was teaching the Israelites to look to "Christ" on the "cross" as their way to salvation and "forgiveness" of sins.|`|419rBxh0aa	Human language and culture have changed quite a lot since we first came across them. A long time ago things weren't even written down at all. That took a long time to become trendy.<br>  <br>  Whatever was written there originally might have made perfect sense to the people of the time, but all remaining meaning might have been lost in the translation between languages and cultures across time. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Incidentally, why are you using the word "rationalising" when talking about christians? Surely "irrationalising" would make more sense?|`|ancp7jNGaa	Great question.  The Christians say that the parts of the Bible they like are literal and the parts they do not like are metaphorical.|`|cTU8FNWoaa	It is not rationalizing. It is reading the Bible in the context in which it was written.<br>  <br>  You cannot read the Bible like a newspaper anymore than you can read any ancient text as if it were written for you in modern times. Some parts any person can understand, but some parts need further knowledge of their culture and the writer's intent to understand. It is not "encrypted", but written by a different society, and people need to read it in its proper context.<br>  <br>  It doesn't say the sky is made of water... And what's your problem with nipples on men? Honesty... You read things as they were meant to be read. You read different parts of the Bible as history, poetry, metaphorical, records, law, and every other category. It was written a long time ago... so don't read it as if it were written yesterday. That's why there are scholars and such to read it in the original Greek text and see what the writer meant in proper context.<br>  <br>  And God didn't write the Bible literally. It says clearly that people inspired by God wrote it. It does not have to be rationalized, but understood in context. I hope this helps.|`|681671b8db63cde85f65759dcf0f542caa	I believe metaphors were used in the Bible to capture the imagination of early followers. Could you have imagined explaining the Bible to second century farmers during a time where most people couldn't read?|`|M2jKYI2daa	The Bible is perhaps the most influential book in history, and most translated, so calling it delusional is undeserved.<br>  <br>  The Bible, IMHO, was never meant to be taken literally. Only when the imperial and papal authorities claimed it to be the official doctrine of state did the more reasoned approach fall out of favor. Then the Bible became a social contract to be sworn upon, instead of a compilation of Jewish and Messianic teachings consummated in the ministry of Christ. <br>  <br>  .

Q58uacnnaa	Cristo morreu na cruz pelos nossos pecados...<br>  A imagem de Cristo na cruz, crucificado, como há em muitos lugares representa a DERROTA momentanea de Jesus, ou seja a vitória de momentanea de Satanás...<br>  <br>  Já a cruz vazia, representa a VITóRIA!! A vitória de que Jesus Cristo ressuscitou para que f?ssemos salvos de todo o pecado, para que f?ssemos libertos das cadeias do diabo...<br>  <br>  <br>  Como diz um hino:<br>  <br>  <br>  1 Se a cruz tomarmos nós, iremos dor sofrer?<br>  N?o vamos só sofrer; por certo até morrer.<br>  O que ela representa é o nosso aniquilar;<br>  Prová-la faz o "eu" crucificado ser.<br>  <br>  2 Divina liberdade vem mediante a cruz.<br>  Cruel parece ser, mas que liberta??o!<br>  Da cruz, se escaparmos, Cristo n?o irá,<br>  Ser nossa vida, nem em nós ter express?o.<br>  <br>  3 A cruz tem como alvo o querer de Deus,<br>  Mas nosso ego se op?e a tal querer.<br>  Negada a vida d'alma, morto o nosso "eu",<br>  O que Deus planejou irá prevalecer. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Deus aben?oe!!!!!!!!!!|`|ISL0zkDBaa	Jesus n?o morreu em uma cruz, sim em uma estaca.Atos 5:30- Hebreus 6:6 mas que se afastaram,reanima-los  novamente ao arrependimento porque eles de novo pregaram para si mesmo o Filho de Deus numa estaca e e expoem ao oprobrio público.Portanto n?o há significado nenhum na cruz, adorar uma cruz é mesmo que adorar um objeto qualquer feito pela m?o de homens.|`|Let9XrHWaa	A cruz significa q Jesus morreu nela.Ela está vazia pq ele morreu , mas já reviveu e vive para todo o sempre.

Jesus morreu numa cruz porque essa era a pena capital no império romano do tempo dele. Os romanos, ao dominarem os povos antigos, deixavam que estes cultivassem sua religi?o, contudo, n?o aceitavam que os povos dominados impusessem a pena de morte. Foi por isso que os sacerdotes judaicos entregaram Jesus a Pilatos, pois se matassem Jesus, como a Lei mosaica dizia que teria de ser feito, eles estariam sujeitos à pena de morte, que era justamente a cruz. Jesus pegou a pena capital, a cruz. Ora, se uma pessoa que eu amo morrer a facadas, por acaso vou carregar essa faca no pesco?o para lembrar disso? N?o irei eu odiar a faca enquanto viver? Muitas pessoas n?o lutam pelo fim das armas de fogo justamente porque perderam entes queridos por armas de fogo? Pra que amar a cruz se foi nela que morreu  quem mais amamos? A morte de Cristo na cruz é que deve ter especial significado para nós, pois foi com a morte dele que fomos trazidos à vida. A cruz é anda, Jesus é tudo.|`|lPZ5ECqEaa	sofrimento.

9syZOhTgaa	I think what I've learned is what I suspected all along, that deeply-held beliefs don't improve most people.  This forum should be used for dialogue, understanding one another, maybe some gentle missionary persuasion.  Instead I see mostly sniping, and derision from both sides--actually from -all- sides.  Christians post stuff like 'Hey, Atheists, what are you gonna do when you go to Hell, huh?'  Atheists tell Christians to get over their delusions or to come to their senses.  And -both- take gratuitous swipes as Muslims and Jews.  8^<  Neither side seems interested in the kind of mutual respect I think we should have in discussions like this.<br>  <br>  You would get the idea that the whole purpose of religion, or even secular philosophy, is to help one feel superior and give one excuses to be snotty to those who don't agree with him.<br>  <br>  I blame politics for this because for the last 25 years politics has co-opted religion in ways it didn't before.  Politicians have corrupted religious leaders, and together they have done all they could to set Americans against each other.|`|AA10667433	Well, I had 3 questions deleted yesterday (first time posting here) because they obviously didn't line up with someone else's viewpoint.  They were not offensive or vulgar.  Someone apparently just didn't like what I had to say.  And because my statements concerned the fact that I am an Atheist, I can only guess it was theists who had them deleted.  So, the conclusion I have drawn, is that there are many theists here who will do anything to eradicate opposing viewpoints.  Very sad.|`|0l1FrUAkaa	Yes.|`|1ushlLQMaa	Everyone is arrogant and thinks their belief is the truth. I do include myself in this thought. Yes, I am flawed and belief it is my way or the highway.

Sorry, I lost myself there for a moment, I am in the middle of reading Harry Potter; so I sort of have 'house-elf on the brain'.<br>  <br>  But seriously, I think that people need to lighten up a bit, there is so much life passing certain people by. Why stress about what others do or do not believe? The word is out all over the world, people can research things about all faiths on the Internet, they can search for a place of worship on the net as well, there are sites available to answer all their questions, and finally; I truly think God is capable of sorting it all out when we die.<br>  <br>  Free will is the state of being, that frees your will; to practice your faith and beliefs.

AA12349214	Well I totally understand what you are saying - but on the other hand - why shouldnt we have a day that is especially 'ours' - when it is celebrated just because we are here and actually HAVE made it to another year.  There are so many of us now it would be very easy just to become one of the crowd with no individual identity.  At least by having a birthday we are, for one day at least, a single individual and that day is celebrated by friends and relatives.  It is good for the human psyche too to know that other people acknowledge their existence and that for one day at least we are 'the' special person.<br>  Does that help any?|`|SRzgmPwraa	HAPPY BIRTHDAY<br>  it is a good question.<br>  many places in the world don't celebrate birthdays.<br>  but in this part of the world we make such a big deal out of it .<br>  it doesn't make sense.<br>  like u said it's just another day.|`|9QMoPcjGaa	I don't understand either, I believe though it's celebrating the day you came on this earth and the symbolism is having your health and being lucky enough to have all the things you do, and be happy you're not dead and your life is a precious gift, but who REALLY wants to celebrate getting older and older!?!?!?<br>  <br>  xxxx|`|PdqBZxiKaa	happy birthday your just celebrating another year off living hoping you make it to the next|`|jDnqtQJ5aa	well you could get run over by a bus tomorow so its like celebrating the day u were born, its also a day about u!

GOD, if the chance came up... I don't know what it is about him, but alas, he must never know. He's got a lucky girlfriend, that's for sure.|`|47900dab377c6689d2dca1fad67b8290aa	i found out when one of my close friends who i new was bi told me she liked me and i dated her for awhile. i was questioning a little before that but looking back now there were a lot of signs...i would say that if you think you might be to try some different things and find out what feels comfortable and go with that. good luck!|`|87YlFfuiaa	I started to like this girl...i was confused at first. But when I started to like this other girl...I knew. It was just the way I felt, and how the girls affected me.|`|J9DBtX49aa	i am in your situation. personally, i don't think people "find out". i think that once you start to think about it you become confused. once you let things sink in and accept it is the point you are sure. if that makes sense. good luck. hang in there. try not to worry too much.|`|mF7bgDZZaa	When I first started becoming interested in boys, I just remember thinking that I was equally  interested in girls. <br>  <br>  I had never heard of gays, lesbians, or bisexuals, before; so I didn't think it was exactly normal (I mean, every couple on TV and in movies was boy/girl.) ... but I didn't think it was strange or wrong, either. I guess I thought of myself as a little special, until I found out that I wasn't the only one.|`|6BqOo0lyaa	I have always seen women as beautiful sexual beings and the first time I was kissed by a girl I knew it was ok for me to live out my desires!  I still love men and i like to enjoy women.|`|UrJjzmZ0aa	It's funny...cuz looking back I now see alot of sings. At the time, I didn't think much of the feelings I had for certain people of the same sex. Like somebody above me already said, it doesn't just happen...BAM! You're bi! It's a discovery process that usually ends up in you accepting yourself.<br>  <br>  Personally, I knew I was at least bi-curious when i had deep feelings for this guy and then found myself crushing on my best friend (a girl). I find people of both genders equally attractive though keep in mind that some bi-sexuals tend to lean towards one sex more than the other.<br>  <br>  My advice to you: analyze your feelings. Try new things. Love yourself. Keep your head up and stick to what feels right. Good luck!|`|W8Xh0KxJaa	I fell for a music teacher. She was learning to become a choir teacher and she came to our school for experience. She was damn near beautiful, and I couldn't keep my eyes off her. That was when I was bi-curious.<br>  <br>  Another time, I fell for this girl I knew on LiveJournal. Didn't really talk much with her, but I have seen her pictures and read her entries. She was really pretty, and interesting too. She was able to say everything that I was afraid of saying. To her mom, about her friends, a lot of things. I knew then I was bisexual.<br>  <br>  My sister, mum, and brother soon found out, and it became disastrous. She never knew, but I went through hell. They think I'm straight now. But I'm still bi, and happily in a relationship with my girlfriend, which they also don't know.

8TNBtvnOaa	Interesting dream.  As has been said you can't always take dreams literally.  They're your mind's way of "cleaning house" I suppose while you're not awake.  Most of my dreams mean something, but they're usually not completely obvious.<br>  <br>  This one strikes me as simply an extreme type of thing.  Meaning - possibly there's something between you and your brother (not even necessarily to do with him being gay) that you feel is unresolved or unsaid.  Maybe it's something small even, but your dream puts you in a situation where there are regrets and you deal with them in a way that you wouldn't (from the sound of it) in the "real" world.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, maybe you're currently angry with your brother over something (again, not necessarily over a gay related issue) and that's your mind's way of "taking it out" on him in an indirect way.  Or maybe you really are just cold-hearted.<br>  <br>  Really, the only way to interpret dreams is get some ideas and see which ones apply to you.  I tend to have the same dream, or the same theme of dreams, until an issue is resolved in my mind.  Then I know I've figured it out correctly.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps some!|`|adcfdd60dce6d4c5eee22d88d7f79f6caa	Yes, I have watched the show Will and Grace.|`|e0a68484780e49fc1c353ad71bddecf9aa	Well its just a dream.

AA10198840	You have to be true to God and what His Spirit reveals. The Catholic Church does have a formality for doing this, using it check your reasons and intentions, and to make you aware that you will be considered apostate and a heretic. <br>  <br>  To them, you will have left the Church of Christ. That is their reality... but is it God's? The early Church of Christ was all who believed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and had received His Spirit. It was also these proofs that Peter used in Acts 10 and 11 to testify that they were hallmarks of those Gentiles who were now Christians. <br>  <br>  The Catholic Church is making the same errors that the Jews did in those days, demanding that Gentiles be circumcised and adhere to the Jewish laws and traditions. In Acts 15, Paul, Barnabas and others go to Jerusalem, where Peter addresses the council to discuss this matter. James makes the decision that this was not to be required of them as the first bishop (pope) of the early Church, headquartered there.<br>  <br>  The truth is that the Church of Christ is larger than the Catholic Church.... that the Catholic Church is just a part of it, and that it includes all who are Christians, such as the other orthodox and reformation denominations and churches. Of course, Catholics will not accept this truth... proved by the belief in Jesus Christ and with the authority of the indwelling Holy Spirit.|`|8UTdi5G0aa	Just stop going there.|`|HM6J2kjtaa	Allow the Holy Spirit to guide you on this decision.

The Sacraments are permanent, though, so there is no real way to "break" them.  It is YOUR decision to go to another church - although I might invite you to try another Catholic Church first.  There are Charismatic prayer groups and different types of prayer services in the Catholic Church - I'd really invite you to try that first before deciding to leave.  Nonetheless - it IS your decision.  I'm just speaking from my own experience in searching for another church because the Catholic Church seemed not to "fill the need" I had for a more spontaneous, spirit-filled (contemporary) type of worship service.  I called a phone number from an Evangelical organization and the operator directed me to a different Catholic Church - since that was my background.  <br>  Over the past few years I've been active with LifeTeen, a youth movement, XLT a monthly praise and worship service (very spirit-filled) and finding out more about the history and depth of the Catholic Church.  Sometimes when we understand the "whys" we can appreciate the traditions more.  I pray that you will find Christ wherever you decide to go - because that's where you'll find Him. . . .looking for YOU!<br>  Peace!|`|DlZTqMicaa	Go to a Sunday mass spider style (watch Exorcist first), then hiss loudly when the pastor sprinkle you with holy water|`|LrumHkCOaa	I don't understand, do you think you need to fill out a form 6b or something to leave a church.

All salvation comes from Christ through his Body, the Church which is necessary for salvation because Christ is present in his Church.<br>  Jesus said, "The man who believes and accepts Baptism will be saved; the man who refuses to believe in it will be condemned" (Mk 16:16). By these words Jesus also affirmed the necessity of the Church, because Baptism is its door to the Church.<br>  Refusing to Enter <br>  Someone who knows the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God and refuses to enter or remain in it, cannot be saved.<br>  Just Not Knowing <br>  However, those, who through no fault of their own do not know either the Gospel of Christ or his Church, can achieve salvation by seeking God with a sincere heart and by trying to do God's will (Second Vatican Council). Although God can lead all people to salvation, the Church still has the duty to evangelize all men.<br>  No Salvation Outside the Church - Church Fathers<br>  The following quotations from the Church Fathers give the straight story. They show that the early Church held the same position on this as the contemporary Church does—that is, while it is normatively necessary to be a Catholic to be saved (see CCC 846; Vatican II, Lumen Gentium 14), there are exceptions, and it is possible in some circumstances for people to be saved who have not been fully initiated into the Catholic Church (CCC 847). <br>  <br>  Notice that the same Fathers who declare the normative necessity of being Catholic also declare the possibility of salvation for some who are not Catholics. <br>  <br>  These can be saved by what later came to be known as "baptism of blood" or " baptism of desire" The Fathers likewise affirm the possibility of salvation for those who lived before Christ and who were not part of Israel, the Old Testament People of God. <br>  <br>  However, for those who knowingly and deliberately (that is, not out of innocent ignorance) commit the sins of heresy (rejecting divinely revealed doctrine) or schism (separating from the Catholic Church and/or joining a schismatic church), no salvation would be possible until they repented and returned to live in Catholic unity. <br>  <br>  Origen<br>  "[T]here was never a time when God did not want men to be just; he was always concerned about that. Indeed, he always provided beings endowed with reason with occasions for practicing virtue and doing what is right. In every generation the wisdom of God descended into those souls which he found holy and made them to be prophets and friends of God" (Against Celsus 4:7 [A.D. 248]). <br>  <br>  "If someone from this people wants to be saved, let him come into this house so that he may be able to attain his salvation. . . . Let no one, then, be persuaded otherwise, nor let anyone deceive himself: Outside of this house, that is, outside of the Church, no one is saved; for, if anyone should go out of it, he is guilty of his own death" (Homilies on Joshua 3:5 [A.D. 250]).<br>  Infallible Authority to Teach with Certitude<br>  The Catholic Church was founded by our Lord to bring salvation to all men. Christ established only one Church with one set of beliefs (Eph. 4:4–5). He did not establish numerous churches with contradictory beliefs. <br>  <br>  He commissioned his Church to teach all nations and to teach them infallibly—guided, as he promised, by the Holy Spirit until the end of the world (John 14:26, 16:13). The mere fact that the Church teaches that something is definitely true is a guarantee that it is true (cf. Matt. 28:18-20, Luke 10:16, 1 Tim. 3:15).<br>  <br>  "And so I tell all of you; what you prohibit on earth will be prohibited in heaven, and what you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven". - Matthew 18,18 <br>  <br>  "Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me." - Luke 10,16<br>  <br>  You can take your chances of course.<br>  <br>  Peace and blessings!

xjGBFeuwaa	I completely agree, many people still refuse to accept homosexuality and dont wish to allow it, mostly because it is something science is yet to explain, however, people can determine for themselves why someone commits murder or child molestion, they simply put it down as evil, but are confused as to why homosexuality exists and still have a slight fear of it.|`|37905111a3c32a77dd6052f6907aacb4aa	I don't know if homosexuals will "go to hell" but i do know you will be judged by your works.

I agree with you, but when people put God into the picture, it is their way of trying to make sense out of it I guess. The problem is, God only works for some people.... not all of us can just write off the "sins" of others by saying "OOPS. I'm sorry." If my child was molested, there is no God that could make that person forgiven.... So I think it's okay for those who find comfort in God to use him that way. If it makes their minds at ease, go for it. The rest of us just have to find our own ways of dealing with "sin" as they call it.|`|f61d7b55c7a8f82e1a344628134f4f1eaa	problem is that murder, adultery and th elike are in fact well covered by the 10 commandments but being homosexual isn;t. Thus th efirst are actually sins which god will forgive if th esinner is repentent. However, since homosexuality isn't in th ebig 10, it isn't a sin thus no forgiveness is needed. So, only those who hate gay people will say it is unforgivable to be gay. But in doing so they are either sinning by breaking the commandment that requires you to love your neightbous r as yourself or they actually hate themselves. Either way, they are sinners and only if they repent will they see the kingdom of heaven.|`|vgUpYsLYaa	god will love u even if u are homosexuality|`|vztFhjaoaa	God loves Every one of us.

No one book is better or less than another one. But the ones that hit home to me or help me or that really speak to me are the gospels, 1 John, Revelation, Philippians, James, Psalms, Genesis, 1 Peter, Ephesians, Ecclesiastes, Isaiah, 1 and 2 Samuel. But I love all of them. <br>  Ephesians 6:10-18 and 1 Thessalonians 4:8 talk about putting on spiritual armour and this is so that you can be protected by God from the devil, the powers of this dark world, the spiritual forces of evil. I study the Word daily, sometimes for say half an hour, other days I study for several hours. I ask God to show me what His Word means (right context). I may not get an understanding right away, but with more study, it opens up to me and I see things in a different light that I never saw before even after reading/studying the same Scripture over and over and over. <br>  If people are not prepared each day, it is easy to slip into the devil's grasp of evil, whether it be the cares and riches of this world turning someone away from God, turning away from God because of hardships and persecutions or Satan taking someone away (parable of the Sower). It is easy to put physical things more important than God and to focus oneself on earthly things and not spiritual things. Not that physical or earthly things are wrong. They can be very good, especially in understanding God Who made Creation. But God is to come first in everything. God is to come first before material things, before family and friends, before property, before one's own life. It says, "Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well."<br>  Also, if someone is not well grounded in God, Scripture, Christianity, it is easy to get frustrated, discouraged, depressed, anxious, mad, give up, and so forth. But when someone is well grounded, they are able to stand firm and finish the race.  I find if I miss even one day of studying, I go down a notch. I have memorized, with God's help, word-for-word: Jude, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, Titus, Philemon, James, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians and am now memorizing Colossians. I plan to memorize the whole Bible while I live. But God gets the glory more than I do as I wouldn't be able to memorize unless He had blessed me with the gift. <br>  <br>  Joy stands for:<br>  <br>  Jesus<br>  Others<br>  You<br>  <br>  When Jesus comes first, then others and yourself last, that is when you find true joy in the Lord, even more so when you bear all suffering with faith and love.|`|Brto7Eyjaa	I study the word once every thousand years, as I lie in wait, lurking, readying for the immortal conflict against the legions of Hell.

77622be92ab404409f818db551a4987aaa	Some people associate sex with love and assume they are the same things.  They feel that if you want to have sex with someone that you must be in love with them.  They see sex as the ultimate expression of love.  They see sex as being THE relationship or at least a huge part of the relationship.<br>  <br>  Others see sex as a fun activity that you can do with someone you love or can be done with someone you just lust without adding additional emotional meaning to it. These are the ones that see sex as an important part of a relationship, but only just a part of it and they place much more importance on things like companionship and being each other's best friend, true love (not lust-induced love), honoring and caring for your spouse, truly being soul mates.<br>  <br>  It's just different outlooks on life and living together.

Unfortunately, we forgot to eat the fruit of immortality.  Otherwise I could more accurately answer your question, and less speculate.  It was thought that "Adam and Eve" was a creation myth just like any other, however, geneticists have proved that humanity was indeed nearly wiped from the face of the Earth nearly 60,000 years ago, and from there, a new species emerged:  us.  So the Adam and Eve story wasn't too far off base.  The probability that Eden was in Africa is very great.  Perhaps the Rift Valley somewhere, not in the land of Ur as was previously suggested by Arabian scholars.  (The land of Ur was situated between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.)<br>  <br>  So, there you have the basis for a really good movie.  Like OH, "Tomb Raiders"
GkJqIkdVaa	Olá amiga<br>  Idosa é uma pessoa que tem muita idade. Velha é a pessoa que perdeu a jovialidade.<br>  A idade causa degenerescência das células. <br>  A velhice causa a degenerescência do espírito. <br>  Por isso nem todo idoso é velho e há velho que ainda nem chegou a ser idoso.<br>  Você é idoso quando sonha. é velho quando apenas dorme.<br>  Você é idoso quando ainda aprende. é velho quando já nem ensina.<br>  Você é idoso quando pratica esportes, ou de alguma outra forma se exercita. é velho quando apenas descansa.<br>  Você é idoso quando ainda sente amor. é velho quando só tem ciúmes e sentimento de posse.<br>  Você é idoso quando o dia de hoje é o primeiro do resto de sua vida. é velho quando todos os dias parecem o último da longa jornada.<br>  Você é idoso quando seu calendário tem amanh?s. é velho quando seu calendário só tem ontens.<br>  <br>  O idoso é aquela pessoa que tem tido a felicidade de viver uma longa vida produtiva, de ter adquirido uma grande experiência. Ele é uma ponte entre o passado e o presente, como o jovem é uma ponte entre o presente e o futuro. E é no presente que os dois se encontram.<br>  Velho é aquele que tem carregado o peso dos anos, que em vez de transmitir experiência às gera??es vindouras, transmite pessimismo e desilus?o. Para ele, n?o existe ponte entre o passado e o presente, existe um fosso que o separa do presente pelo apego ao passado.<br>  O idoso se renova a cada dia que come?a; o velho se acaba a cada noite que termina. <br>  O idoso tem seus olhos postos no horizonte de onde o sol desponta e a esperan?a se ilumina.<br>  O velho tem sua miopia voltada para os tempos que passaram. <br>  O idoso tem planos. O velho tem saudades. <br>  O idoso curte o que resta da vida. O velho sofre o que o aproxima da morte.<br>  O idoso se moderniza, dialoga com a juventude, procura compreender os novos tempos. O velho se emperra no seu tempo, se fecha em sua ostra e recusa a modernidade.<br>  O idoso leva uma vida ativa, plena de projetos e de esperan?as. Para ele o tempo passa rápido, mas a velhice nunca chega.<br>  O velho cochila no vazio de sua vida e suas horas se arrastam destituídas de sentido. <br>  As rugas do idoso s?o bonitas porque foram marcadas pelo sorriso. As rugas do velho s?o feias porque foram vincadas pela amargura.<br>  Em resumo, idoso e velho, s?o duas pessoas que até podem ter a mesma idade no cartório, mas têm idade bem diferente no cora??o.<br>  <br>  <br>  xixa|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	Nenhuma...|`|pmwOpUs0aa	Velho é qualquer coisa usada,suada,idoso é quem passou dos 60 anos.|`|uG8cAyabaa	Velho é uma coisa que se estraga com o tempo...uma cadeira velha...uma roupa velha...etc...<br>  <br>  Idoso é quando a pessoa já tem uma idade avan?ada.....|`|2NDhcHVwaa	Pela legisla??o brasileira, s?o considerados idosos todos aqueles maiores de 60 anos de idade.<br>  Uma pessoa velha é uma pessoa que tem experiência que tem conhecimento, uma pessoa com mais sabedoria.

The thing really for you to do is talk to someone, an adult you trust, your parents (hopefully ) or if not them, some adult you *do* trust.

I myself wouldnt really like to be snogged by a girl, but i dont think of it as repulsive or anything. And when i see two straight people kiss I just dont really mind at all. Straight or not, whats so disgusting about love between two people?|`|e47f9080b55b825ad479c944dbbb19fbaa	Yes, it is very disgusting.. It's people like you that oppress us and call us f@gs!!! I hate all straight people... And seeing them kiss is one of the most disgusting things on earth!!!|`|j7saQnvvaa	well i am straight and i feel if anyone kisses no matter the gender if they care about each other who cares.|`|vlwzRuNRaa	No. Not at all.|`|XHGGcNywaa	I don't find it disgusting. I just find it weird. But I'm sure they think the exact same thing when I kiss someone of the same sex. =p|`|609ZUSD3aa	Yes, I do find heterosexual kissing a little disgusting. But then, I don't really watch. If they love each other, I'm happy for them. Their kissing is between them, and doesn't involve me anyway. If I choose to stare at them, then I deserve whatever nausea might ensue!

Yes in the respect that what we want is no longer a house on 20 acres, but no on the idea that we all want our living space, a rewarding job to pay for it all, and some stuff.

AA11412999	Yeah there are a few out there.  Right off the top of my head these are two that I can think of:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.swingersboard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.swingersboard.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.swinglifestyle.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.swinglifestyle.com</a><br>  <br>  The first link is an awesome message board.  There are no ads allowed on this site and it just 100% discussion.  There is a link for club listings/reviews, but don't forget to check the clubs forum itself for first-hand experiences from folks there.<br>  <br>  SwingLifestyle also has club listings and reviews I think, but I haven't been on that site in a while.  It may have changed some.  Hope this helps!|`|0eWoQy5oaa	Darkcavern is a good site for interracial swinging<br>  <br>  The-Impregnorium.com is a good swinging site for couples looking for impregnation<br>  <br>  Breedingclub.com is the poor site - mostly fake<br>  <br>  PS - why give me the thumbs down you moron! I gave you handy informatiom. Loser!
uLYlQMs3aa	Not to my knowledge. I know there have been hate crimes by other races against other races as long as man has existed in different shades of skin. The KKK is probably one of the larger groups out there and has sought after media attention for as long as humans have gossiped about their undertakings. The "colored" groups that have done things like what the Klan has done are generally small and secretive and not trying to be blatant about it. Just my un educated guess.<br>  Edit: I agree that the Black Panthers were very extreme, but as they aimed more at politically based racism I didn't include them. <br>  Now that I think about you'd have to bring up Calypso Louie A.K.A. Louis Farrakhan or Louis Eugene Walcott. Now he has some very extreme and racist views about everyone who isn't "black" and isn't Muslim. So I guess we could include him as well.|`|fUjPfW3Paa	Yes. The Black Panthers were very extreme.
tpeuexAwaa	Maybe he finds your glasses / hairstyle / ear-rings / moles  etc interesting that's why he's looking at u.  <br>  <br>  Assuming that there's nothing wrong with ur face...looking at the same person constantly is a sign that he's interest in u.<br>  <br>  <br>  Simarly to the first poster, I've been in this situation heaps of times.  <br>  Like the old saying goes, "If u never ask u never know".<br>  <br>  U don't have to ask him straight forwardly. Instead u can just smile at him and when he smiles back, start conversing with him.<br>  <br>  One point I like to make: < It's easy to be friend with people u don't find attractive; but it's hard to be friend with people who u really like.  >  Ask urself this, do u want this person to be your friend?|`|EusBc70oaa	If you aren't openly gay he could be in the same situation. He could also be straight and wondering why you're always checking him out. Why aren't you openly gay, by the way? It's a lot easier to come out now than it was just a few years ago. There are support groups, phone lines, openly gay people you could befriend for advice...<br>  Living in the closet is only going to make situations like this more difficult than they need to be. Dating is tough enough when people are open and honest!|`|IjoeQaf4aa	You should try to talk to him. Casually...I mean, you never know. I read what you wrote and I think of how many times I've experienced that same "looking" but it's turned out to be nothing. Think about how many time you look at random people...or people you see everyday, just in passing. Sometimes I just "people watch." No rhyme or reason other than it entertains me at a basic level. <br>  <br>  If you're interested...what harm could it be just to talk to the guy? <br>  <br>  I used to think men never talked to each other (lol). At least, if they did it was always about upping one another or talking about sex or sports. *sigh* I know. I'm a silly, silly girl.|`|OKtcEFMTaa	I Would Talk To Him, See If He Starts Flirting Or Gives You The Impression He Likes You, And Then You Can Figure It Out From Their,|`|Jun1daTUaa	He's probably looking at you because you're always looking at him ;p|`|K2C3437Raa	if he's looking at you he likes you, he thinks your hot and just likes to look at you, he's a stalker, or you jsut happen to be in his line of visison.<br>  <br>   the "today he was walking with his hand around a girl and he looked down and didnt look at me as he walked past me. " part, he could be ashamed that you saw him with a girl if when he think you interested in him, he gets embarresed when he's near you , or he looked down because he didn't want the girl to see him looking at you or she somehow knows he likes someones else (you) and he didn't wan't her to do or say something to you. <br>  <br>   If your interested in him, talk to him. Also you might want to know something about him, before you d talk, so it will make him beleive that  your interested. and if he wasn't interested in the firt place then you can say you heard about him from someone or something like that.|`|NkNNSAHOaa	how old r u|`|de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	i guess this guy may have a crush on you.<br>  and i think you should talk to him about this "looking" thing.|`|5sp0jxgGaa	try to make friend with him dear. talk to him nicely and get to know him better. there is a lot reasons to look at someone, well maybe u looked attractive and eye-catching. but that doesnt mean he like u. all u can do now is to be friend with  him thats all..

zGvcNgTtaa	I don't think any other country really advertises medications like the United States does on television commercials. The only advertisement in other countries probably only comes from doctors or pharmacists who recommend or actually dispense the medications. The US pushes medicating people, instead of actually treating them and curing what they have, because they want to make money of course, because the pharmaceutical/medical/insurance companies rule the world. That is basically why we see a medication commercial probably every 5 minutes in the US. |`|0sYOCj7Qaa	Of course that's not true. Restless legs syndrome has always been around, but nobody knew what it was or what caused it until recently.<br>  <br>  If the pharmaceutical companies made up fake diseases and disorders, nobody would buy their meds, since you need a doctor's prescription to obtain them. If RLS doesn't really exist, as you claim, then no legitimate doctor would prescribe medicine to treat it.
aa6de928c91d2e8103ac267e86f67b66aa	Today tv serials are far from reality esp Saas bahu serials, character never become old and they can marry no of times and keep extra marital affairs too!<br>  They are showing what people want to see, pls note mostly viewers of this serials are women. Their TRP shows how popular these serials are (never ending stories), Neither channels nor audience  want to take any kind of responisiblity therefore these senseless serials are increasing day by day! |`|VcLJiLpnaa	I don't know what a Tv serial, or adultry.<br>  <br>  What I can tell you is that these TV series are more realistic regarding the society we live in today.  Adultery is part of today's society, whether you like it or not.  Many times, adultery isn't even promoted in the "name of love" but more just for personal satisfaction.  I think that should be a personal choice and I have no right to impose my morals onto other people and tell them that what they are doing is wrong.  More and more religious people believe it's OK to sleep with someone before marriage as long as it is a serious relationship with a "promising" future.|`|4JpRkP84aa	Every situation has to be seen with a perspective and not with bias.<br>  TV serials are episodes written by a team of writers with the focus on TRP'S (Ratings)only.

Evolution and atheism always shall remain false.  <br>  <br>  As we speak, the Biblical prophecies about the end have already commenced fulfillment - demonstrating once again that the Bible is always true.<br>  <br>  But when we look at the wicked world around us, in which the greedy, the immoral, the killers have caused the economic problems, the wars, the suffering of innocent children in divorced families, and sexually abused children - and when we know that all these have been adequately warned about the divine judgment this carries -  then when God's wrath is expressed and people start dying around us -(yes, now it is coming the Great prophesied Tribulation) we feel not overwhelming sadness but, rather, "a too bad, they brought it upon themselves. They wouldn't listen"<br>  <br>  Righteousness saves and shall save.  Engaging in wickedness will not save, not matter the seeming short term gain.  God will see to that.  The coming years would be better not experienced by any one, but the wicked shall have nowhere to run.  Many will probably be permitted to remain alive to mock until the sign of Christ appears in the heavens.|`|f1e8a20a0e5d8904fb72bbeeeca190d8aa	No, however, an Atheist cannot make moral judgments because the have no basis for their morality.

OuHKDaPaaa	You've been a christian all your life? This is unbiblical.<br>  <br>   Ephesians say that by nature we're children of God's wrath. Jesus said that unless a man is born again he won't see the kingdom.<br>  <br>  For all that is in the world- the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and pride of life- is not from the Father but is from the world.

A good question to ask yourself is:  "What would Jesus do?"  Or think if another Christian approached you with this same question- how would you answer that.<br>  <br>  I want to encourage you to find your answers to every situation in your life not from people's opinions- but from God's word.<br>  <br>  Galatians Chapter 5 is a good chapter to read- which tells us that we have freedom in Christ. But it tells us that we should use our freedom to serve God by following the leading of the Holy Spirit, instead of serving the flesh (the things that we desire and lust for- which are contrary to the things of God).  There are two lists there:  the first one talks about what we used to be- before we knew God-- lustful, envious, etc. the second list talks about the fruits of the Spirit- love, joy, patience, kindness...  And so our lives ought to be directed and characterized by the 2nd list.  <br>  <br>  Remember that when we sin and disobey God it always starts in the heart.  And so while i think what you're asking is kind of "gray area" it's not wise if your desire is to follow the Lord- because it's dangling a temptation across your screen and feeding an appetite that men in general struggle with...<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

Just ask Jim Baker, Jimmy Swaggart, Ted Haggard, or Bristol Palin!!!  <br>  The notion of 'sin' is a religious delusion....Atheists are bound by the same sort of ethical standard that governs ALL thinking and rational people. It does not depend on the outmoded ideas of archaic scriptures. Atheists are faithful to their spouses out of LOVE, Mutual Respect, and an innate sense of the 'rightness' of ones commitment. It has nothing to do with a mythical, punishing god, who turns human failings into punishable "sins".

So when I learned of the concept that God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are three separate and distinct holy beings with bodies of flesh & bone <xcept the HOly Ghost of course> it just totally rang as true and right to me and I left Catholicism.  Father, Son, Holy Ghost all three in one cloudy conglomeration of nothingness just isn't too appetizing to me personally.<br>  <br>  God is far too personal to me to not think of Him in these terms.

The Old Testament gives intimations that there are more than one Person in God. In Genesis 1:26, God says, ``Let us make man to our image and likeness.'' In Isaias 9:6-7, God the Father revealed the imminent coming into the world of God the Son. In Psalms 2:7, we read, ``The Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.'' And in the New Testament, God reveals this doctrine even more clearly. For example, at the baptism of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit appeared in the form of a dove, and the voice of God the Father was heard: ``This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.'' (Matt. 3:16-17). In Matthew 28:19, God the Son commanded the Apostles to baptize ``in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.'' And in 1 Cor. 12:4-6, the Bible refers to God with three names: Spirit, Lord, and God-- corresponding to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. <br>  Three divine Persons in one Godhead may be incomprehensible to the human mind, but that is to be expected. How can man fully comprehend God's infinite make-up when he cannot fully comprehend his own finite make-up? We have to take God's word for it. Also, we can satisfy ourselves as to the feasibility of God's triune make-up by considering various other triune realities. The triangle, for example, is one distinct form with three distinct and equal sides. And the clover leaf is one leaf with three distinct and equal petals. There are many physical trinities on earth, therefore a Spiritual Trinity, who is God in Heaven, is not against human reason--it is simply above human reason.<br>  God bless.|`|a62b895e23928e2555a83a605626c900aa	Hearing in the mind and hearing in the spirit are two very differant things . <br>  When Peter said to Jesus ' You are the Christ, the Son of the living God' , Jesus replied, ' Blessed are you Simon Bar- Jonah , for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My father who is in heaven ' . <br>  <br>  There are mega scriptures that point to what we call the Trinity .

We know that the first century Christians believed that Jesus was the Messiah and the Son of God, but as to when that became equated with being God, nobody is sure.  It was definitely a concrete belief by the end of the first century AD.  The First Council of Nicaea codified this belief in what come down to us as the Nicene Creed.  However, this was in response to the Arian Heresy (not my words) which taught that Jesus was a created being.  So, by this, we know that the concept of Jesus being God was well established before 325 AD.  If you want to investigate the Councils of Nicaea (and the other Ecumenical Councils) in more detail, I suggest the book "Yesterday, Today and Forever" by Peter Toon.|`|93eppE5Gaa	Your response to Dreaming makes me wonder if you don't already have something in mind, as far as a response goes.<br>  <br>  Her response was pretty accurate.<br>  <br>  This is mine:<br>  <br>  There is one God, who exists in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

That is the first step.

According to the King James Bible, which is usually considered the only "truth" Bible, they were called little children.

And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them."<br>  <br>  How does little children somehow equal to young men?

In fact, the same word described soldiers in 1 Kings 20:14-15.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, the killing of anyone, regardless of their age, is a serious matter. <br>  <br>  Their offense must therefore have been very serious, and indeed it was:<br>  <br>   Elisha in 2 Kings 2:23-25  physically represented God in the midst of an Israel who had violated their covenant with Yahweh. Attacking or ridiculing God's prophets was the same as ridiculing God himself. <br>  <br>  The curse called down on them was intended to show Elisha's authority to call on the name of Yahweh and illicit an actual response from him. <br>  <br>  The unruly gang of  troublemaking youths,  respected neither Yahweh's authority nor that of his prophetic representative Elisha and reaped the consequences of their own insolence. <br>  <br>  This event took place around a cult city (somewhere between Bethel and Jericho, a distance of aproximately 10 miles), a pagan center of anti-YHWH worship. <br>  <br>  The harmless "teasing" was hardly that--they were direct confrontation between the forces of Baal and a prophet of YHWH that had just healed the water supply (casting doubt on the power and beneficence of their false god "Baal"!). <br>  <br>  This must have been a mass demonstration because if 42 were mauled, how many teenage hoodlums were in the hostile crowd to begin with? 50? 100? 400?).<br>  <br>  We could therefore quite reasonably interpret the brief account in the Bible like this: <br>  <br>  "As Elisha was traveling from Jericho to Bethel a gang of several dozen youths (young men, not children) confronted him. Perhaps they were young false prophets of Baal. Their jeering, recorded in the slang of their day, implied that if Elisha were a great prophet of the Lord, as Elijah was, he should go on up into heaven as Elijah reportedly had done. The epithet baldhead may allude to lepers who had to shave their heads and were considered detestable outcasts. Or it may simply have been a form of scorn, for baldness was undesirable in that culture in those times. Since it was customary for men to cover their heads, the young men probably could not tell if Elisha was bald or not. <br>  <br>  In any event, hey regarded God's prophet with absolute scorn and contempt....Elisha then called down a curse on the villains. This cursing stemmed not from Elisha's pride but from their disrespect for the Lord as reflected in their treatment of His spokesman.  God used wild animals to execute His immediate judgment on the offenders.<br>  <br>  A careful study of this incident in proper context shows that it was far more serious than a "mild personal offense", or "making jokes about a bald guy."  <br>  <br>  It was a situation of serious public danger, similar to the large youth gangs that roam the ghetto sections of  modern American cities. If these young hoodlums were ranging about in packs of fifty or more, derisive towards respectable adults and ready to mock even a well-known man of God, there is no telling what violence they might have inflicted on the citizenry of the religious center of the kingdom of Israel (as Bethel was), had they been allowed to continue. <br>  <br>  For the record, Elisha didn't actually call out the bears--he merely pronounced judgment on these demonstrators. God decided what form the response took and he saw fit to put forty-two of them to death in this spectacular fashion.<br>  <br>  |`|bb06GQ5Paa	Double dose of the meth today?|`|WF085j2Daa	where do you get your fool pills, they work well
fXfMYzGbaa	Because there is a difference in what a fortune teller is and what a mystic is.<br>  <br>  Mysticism, according to its etymology, implies a relation to mystery. In philosophy, Mysticism is either a religious tendency and desire of the human soul towards an intimate union with the Divinity, or a system growing out of such a tendency and desire. As a philosophical system, Mysticism considers as the end of philosophy the direct union of the human soul with the Divinity through contemplation and love, and attempts to determine the processes and the means of realizing this end. This contemplation, according to Mysticism, is not based on a merely analogical knowledge of the Infinite, but as a direct and immediate intuition of the Infinite. According to its tendency, it may be either speculative or practical, as it limits itself to mere knowledge or traces duties for action and life; contemplative or affective, according as it emphasizes the part of intelligence or the part of the will; orthodox or heterodox, according as it agrees with or opposes the Catholic teaching. We shall give a brief historical sketch of Mysticism and its influence on philosophy, and present a criticism of it.<br>  <br>  Fortune Telling on the other hand is when an individual seeks to tell the future, be it romance, work, money, whatever, by using various tool tarot cards, palm reading, astrology, etc.  The rely on their own abilities (even false one, remember Ms. Cleo?)  to tell the future.<br>  <br>  The difference is Mysticism is an result of in individuals hard drive towards holiness.  It does not always result in a revelation of future events, often it may be a urge to adopted a sort of spiritual practice, or the stigmata, or some other sign of the immediate presence of the Divine  .  Either way the individual mystic accomplishes nothing through their own talents but is revealed to them by God.<br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>  The Orthodox and Many Protestant Church also have Mystics, here is a list of Christian Mystics <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_mystics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chr...</a>|`|OC8NWQkyaa	Because if it is a true "mystic" that is by the Holy Spirit and the others seek power outside of the Holy Spirit.  The two ideas are actually quite different.  The one type of mystic gains extraordinary gifts without seeking them.  <br>  <br>  These gifts of the Holy Spirit are spoken of by St. Paul and our Lord himself.  The gift of love is the greatest gift and noone is considered a saint by prophecy or tounges or visions.

They must not eat pork or shell fish.  Jews have Kosher foods which have standards set by their religious teachings and inspected and blessed by a Rabbi.  Similarly, Muslims have Halal foods which have standards set by their religious teachings.  For Muslims and Jews, food must be clean (by order of God, not just the United States FDA).<br>  <br>  Spring cleaning for Orthodox Jews is mandatory, and it requires the removal of everything from the house and complete cleaning.  Everyone must also appear well groomed and neat.<br>  <br>  The Muslim and Christian religious are offshoots of the Jewish religion, with some things added and some things subtracted.<br>  <br>  Orthodox Jews are ordered not to trim the corners of their head (hence, they have long side burns).  Jews are supposed to be circumcised by a moil in a religious ceremony called a bris, but Christians and Muslims usually don't.<br>  <br>  The word "Moslem" and the word "Muslim" are almost interchangeable.  (See link).<br>  <br>  People like to be around those who share their own interests and backgrounds.  In the Middle East, most Jews and Muslims get along well, though there are some dissenters (and security precautions, designed to protect both Muslims and Jews, create tensions and disputes).  In the United States, most Jews have assimilated into the American culture, and don't think about ethnic differences much.<br>  <br>  Many social functions revolve around churches (or other religious institutions).  Games, plays, picnics, lunches, films, discussions, and other activities draw people to others of their own religions.<br>  <br>  After 911, some Muslim students (Engineers at Georgia Tech, for example) were said to have danced in the streets and cheered.  If so, their actions did not represent the mainstream Muslims in America.  Many American Muslims formally apologized to Americans for the actions of the terrorists, and expressed their deep grief (some with tears in their eyes).  It was as if their individual actions constituted an apology of the entire Middle East, and the individual Americans represented their country (though the exchange was just between individuals).<br>  <br>  Most people just want to get along.  They don't want to be singled out for their religious beliefs.  They want the freedom to practice their beliefs as they and their religious instructors see fit.  It is a great relief for both Muslims and Jews to live in a land where they can get along in harmony and their kids don't have to fear bombs.|`|UIJorsD7aa	Personally, I feel more comfortable around Muslims.<br>  They understand monotheism, they accept me, and they do not try to convert me.<br>  Xians always seem to try and convince me that I am not a "fulfilled Jews" unless I convert to THEIR (polytheistic) religion!<br>  |`|AA11280073	It depends on who the Muslims and Christians are. There are some Muslims and some Christians that no one feels comfortable around. Jews are no different than anyone else when it comes to their preferences.

Your question is not well thought out. |`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	In many parts of the world Jews and Muslims live harmoniously as neighbors. Really, everyone has a problem with American Christian fundamentalists, because it's them against everyone else. <br>  <br>  There is some tension regarding territory that has turned into Muslims trying to depict Jews as evil oppressors, but what it really comes down to is politics not a true hate for the Jewish religion -- at least I don't think that's the case for most Muslims.|`|lh2H5oSOaa	God Almighty sent Jesus Christ to retrieve the lost sheep of Israel. But afraid of losing their power and influence., the Jewish rabbis refused to accept him as a messenger of God. <br>  <br>  After Jesus God sent Muhammad to accomplish that mission. A sizable population of Jews was waiting for the prophet who would lead them to success, but they found another reason to refuse him. He was not the direct descendant of Isac, but his half brother Ishmael.<br>  <br>  Muhammad prayed for 17 months facing the holy city of Jerusalem and fasted like Jews for full day. Holy Quran mentions name of Prophet Moses more than 600 times, whereas Prophet of Islam, Muhammad is mentioned only 5 times. Yet the Jews did not recognize the religious importance of Islam and treated it politically. So a great opportunity was lost by the Jews to close ranks with Muslims.<br>  <br>  Now the followers of the three Divine religions have politicized their affairs so much that the Great Divine Religion of Abraham, which was to become a means or salvation for the humanity has become a bone of contention and it appears that having been disappointed by selfish and narrow goals pursued by the three nations, God Almighty has decided to send Jesus again to complete his mission.<br>  <br>  I see Jesus  coming  within 2008 and all differences and disputes will wither away except between Godly and diabolical  forces and the world will see the great Armageddon in our life time.<br>  <br>                                    Muhammad Javed Iqbal|`|NI0cNU22aa	I feel more comfortable around other Jews.<br>  <br>  Most Muslims have a problem with Jews - you know it's true, newspapers in Muslim countries are notorious for running anti-Jew propaganda - and Christians think Jews are incomplete.|`|zauQuf29aa	I would think Jews feel good only around each other.

However, Christianity has evolved into more gentleness appreciation, so from that angle I tend to like Christians more.<br>  <br>  Religiously, both are so far from Judaism in key areas that I can't image going either way.  A keyword for each religion give a clue:<br>  <br>  Christianity:    Faith  <br>  Islam:     Submission  (It's what Muslim means)<br>  Judaism:    Action  <br>  (to bring god into yourself to elevate yourself - & the world)<br>  <br>  Neither of the other religion's essenses are a draw for me & both would feel very different to be a part of.  Traditions-wise, Islam will be more similar, but that submission concept is a huge one.  Islam used to allow for more debate than the way it's set up now & I think that would have been okay.  For instance, I find culturally Persians I meet share a common style of thinking with me if they are progressive & not ultra-religious.  On the other hand, over & over my Muslim contact has met the stereotypes of beliefs that are scary-ish so right now I'm finding I understand Christians better & since I grew up here, I'm a natural part of the culture here.<br>  <br>  So it depends on the person.  I don't think one way or the other until I get to know them.<br>  <br>  ================<br>  Tardis<br>  Very sadly my Muslim liberal peace activist friend found something to admire in 9/11 suicide as brave, & didn't seem to have many feelings about the loss of life.  He was the first person I spoke to after it happened, later that day.  It shocked me.  <br>  <br>  (By peace activitist, I mean a self described definition. I'm finding a lot of the peace activist left of any background has turned into a far right wing style intolerance just with different words & objects of hate than in the past, & they don't recognize it in themselves.)

ij5Sv6staa	I believe it was because God had a plan to use Satan, even in his rebellion.<br>  <br>  All of mankind has been given free will to choose God or not.  God allows Satan to tempt us and test the quality of our character. It is easy to follow God when all your needs are met.<br>  <br>  Job 2:5<br>  But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."<br>  <br>  Only under duress is the true character of a man revealed.|`|47a63f8edc419895369f44d7307f8704aa	Here's my take on things, feel free to bash it ;)<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve were created perfect, but had free will. A perfect angel desired the worship that was given to God, and so misled Adam and Eve into thinking that God was denying them something, and that God's way of ruling was somehow flawed and they could all do better just ruling themselves. God did not predestinate...the Bible indicates that he CAN see into the future if he wants, but allows his creations to make up their own minds.<br>  <br>  Since Adam and Eve chose to follow this angel and be independent of the God who created and provided for them, they were cast out of the garden of Eden and sentenced to grow old and eventually die. <br>  <br>  This raised the question: Whose leadership is best for mankind? The best way for God to illustrate this is by allowing mankind to rule themselves for as long as it takes to illustrate that man cannot direct his own step. Jeremiah 10:23. <br>  <br>  God could've just destroyed that angel, but what would that have proven? All his creations would wonder, "What happens when we govern ourselves, is the outcome really that bad?"<br>  <br>  What we see in mankind's history is the result of "man dominating man to his injury."<br>  |`|vxzyYVeYaa	The rebellion against God in the garden of Eden raised an important issue or question. We need to examine it in order to understand why God has permitted wickedness. Jehovah told Adam not to eat from a certain tree in the garden. If Adam did, what would happen? God said: “You will positively die.” (Genesis 2:17) However, Satan said exactly the opposite. He told Adam’s wife, Eve, to go ahead and eat from the forbidden tree. “You positively will not die,” Satan said. In fact, he went on to tell Eve: “For God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God, knowing good and bad.”—Genesis 3:1-5.<br>  <br>  Eve disobeyed God and ate. Why? Eve believed Satan. She selfishly thought that she would benefit by disobeying God. She reasoned that no longer would she or Adam need to answer to God. No longer would they have to submit to his laws. They could decide for themselves what is “good” and what is “bad.” Adam went along with Eve and also ate. Discussing man’s original sin against God, a footnote in The Jerusalem Bible says: “It is the power of deciding for himself what is good and what is evil and of acting accordingly, a claim to complete moral independence .?.?. The first sin was an attack on God’s sovereignty.” That is, it was an attack on God’s right to be man’s absolute ruler or superior.<br>  Of course, as soon as the rebellion happened Jehovah could have destroyed the three rebels. There was no question that he was stronger than Satan or Adam and Eve. But destroying them would not have settled matters in the best way. For example, it would not have answered the question of whether humans could successfully rule themselves without help from God. So Jehovah allowed time to settle the important issue that was raised.<br>  Now that time has passed, what has been the result? Well, what would you say? Have the past 6,000 years of history shown that humans have been successful in governing themselves without God’s guidance? Have humans provided good government for the blessing and happiness of all? Or has the record of history shown that the prophet Jeremiah’s words are correct: “It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step”?—Jeremiah 10:23.<br>  The evidence should be clear to all. Man’s efforts to govern himself independently of God have been a terrible failure. They have resulted in great human suffering. “Man has dominated man to his injury,” the Bible explains. (Ecclesiastes 8:9) Clearly, humans need God’s guidance in governing their affairs. Just as God created man with the need to eat food and drink water, so man was made with the need to obey God’s laws. If man ignores God’s laws, he will come into difficulty, just as surely as he would suffer if he ignored his body’s need for food and water.—Proverbs 3:5,?6.<br>  However, a person might ask, ‘Why has God permitted so much time, about 6,000 years now, to settle this issue? Could it not have been settled in a satisfactory way long ago?’ Not really. If God had stepped in long ago, the charge could have been made that humans were not given enough time to experiment. But as it is, humans have had plenty of time to develop a government that would satisfy the needs of all its subjects, as well as make scientific discoveries that could contribute to the prosperity of all. Over the centuries humans have tried nearly every form of government. And their progress in the field of science has been remarkable. They have harnessed the atom and traveled to the moon. But what has been the result? Has it brought a grand new system for the blessing of humankind?<br>  Far from it! Instead, there is more unhappiness and trouble on earth than ever before. In fact, crime, pollution, war, family breakdown and other problems have reached such a dangerous stage that scientists believe man’s very existence is threatened. Yes, after about 6,000 years of experience in self-rule, and after reaching a peak in scientific “progress,” humankind is now facing self-destruction! How clear it is that humans cannot successfully govern themselves apart from God! Nor can anyone now complain that God did not allow enough time to settle this issue.|`|AA10409800	The same reason Vader did not destroy Luke on Bespin, and the same reason Agent Smith did not destroy Neo during their first fight...<br>  <br>  They are all STORIES and did not ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

Regardless of what the bible says about man, good and evil are both a part of man's make up. They were created with the gift of choice, unlike the angels of christian mythology. We were created in the same light as Lucifer himself, with the ability to question, ourselves and the world. <br>  <br>  That being said, while Lucifer exacerbated the situation, it was only a matter of time before man discovered sin for himself. Sin is in the very essence of our being, a duality of our spiritual makeup.

Adam and Eve had to be punished too for their disobedience. All parties had to be ejected from God's presence because He can only accept pure holiness in His presence.<br>  <br>  Their sin was not because Lucifer was evil, but because they decided God alone was not enough. <br>  <br>  Lucifer was trickier more than he was evil...and wouldn't it make God pretty cruel to destroy his own creation right there?

Instead, he's been able to show the world how false Satan can be, and reserved judgement for him later after everyone else figures it out.<br>  <br>  In a sense, God is making an example of Satan by keeping him around...|`|9EXtep4Naa	It indeed makes zero sense.

If so...<br>  -- Didn't god make the devil?<br>  ---Yeah, but the devil rebelled.<br>  ----Why doesn't god just unmake him? That would stop evil in the world and then everything would be great.

The tree they ate from represented God's right to tell man what was good or bad. When man wanted to make his own decisions this put God's right to rule in question. All creation was watching. Billions of angels already existed in heaven before man was created. <br>  Now if God destroyed Satan that question would have never been answered. We are answering that question today.Look where we have gotten ourselves without God's help. We need God to tell us what is right and wrong because we have no idea. Look what we do to each other and think it's right. God allowed time for man to find out the hard way that God is the ruler and not we ourselves.<br>  Thankfully God has made arrangements to rectify all the things that have happened though His Kingdom with Jesus as King. Read your bible and see what wonderful things we have to look forward to.<br>  <br>  (Revelation 21:3-4) 3?With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples.

But in asking your question, you must be willing to entertain the central tenents of christianity to even have this discussion.<br>  <br>  1) God is perfect. <br>  2) God made both Angels and Man with eternal souls<br>  <br>  There are of course other central tenants but these are the 2 we are using to answer your question.<br>  <br>  Its really quite simple....<br>  <br>  IF God is perfect, then he can not make a mistake. <br>  IF God made both angels and man with eternal souls then we can assume he WANTED them to live forever. <br>  Therefore, it would be AS IF he made a mistake in creating them, if he later destroyed something which he intended to be eternal. <br>  Anotherwards, destroying something that was originally created eternal, would mean he originally made a mistake and is therefore NOT PERFECT. -- which would violate a whole bunch of central tenants and cause other logical fallacies.<br>  <br>  SO, simply put.. HE CAN'T - it violates his perfectness. <br>  <br>  That also kinda necessitates Hell..because coupled with Freewill..there is the potential for someone to completely reject God (which is what Lucifer did) so God has to make an allowance for SOMEWHERE for an eternal soul to exist yet respect their total rejection of him. -- Hell is the one place God isn't personally connected to. -- That's what makes hell a baaaaaddddd place|`|bW4RET0Waa	It wasn't only Lucifer he had to deal with. If God had destroyed him, what would that have told the angels? That God was a dictator and they would be afraid of Him. Instead Lucifer raised a question in mankind's mind of weather God was just, for keeping the fruit of the tree of life from mankind. So, He is letting us see for ourselves that He is just, and that Lucifer is wrong. It also brought up the question if anyone could stay true to God. There can be no doubt in mans mind that we can't live without God being in our lives. Haven't reached that point yet. I suggest you do some reading in the Book of Revelation for some hard answers. You'll need help so go to www.watchtower.org and you can get the Book of Revelation and help there. Pray for the understanding to come to you and it will. <br>  <br>  My best to you. |`|jg5Ii27Vaa	Because God gave Lucifer free choice. God didn't and doesn't destroy us when we sin. 
oGRsxfBiaa	Here Jesus just tells us that we should not worry about the earthly things because God will always sustain us if we ask him. <br>  <br>  I would love to say that I follow this teaching 100%, but that would mean literally giving up every single thing I have an putting my trust in God to take care for me, and I can't say that I can fully do that :( Saying that I do trust God to take care of me and my family if something should go wrong.. like when my partner lost his job recently because of the economic crisis and we didn't have much savings or anything, I prayed really hard for God to help him find another job, and he did 2 weeks later :) <br>  <br>  I do follow this teaching to an extent that spiritual is and always will be more important to me than having fancy clothes or expensive food, I am not rich by any means by the Western standards, but I know that I am far better off than most of the Earth's population, and I am thankful every day for that, because honestly I did not do anything to deserve this. I only really worry about money when there is a real threat that I won't be able to pay the bills and the rent, but when that is in check I never even think about it.|`|SoMwLi2Qaa	It's part of the general Christian message of "Don't worry about the things of this world for they are of no importance in comparison to the salvation of your soul."

"Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day." John 10:10; 4:14; John 6:54.  <br>       To the believer, death is but a small matter. Christ speaks of it as if it were of little moment. "If a man keep My saying, he shall never see death," "he shall never taste of death." To the Christian, death is but a sleep, a moment of silence and darkness. The life is hid with Christ in God, and "when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory." John 8:51, 52; Colossians 3:4.   <br>       The voice that cried from the cross, "It is finished," was heard among the dead. It pierced the walls of sepulchers, and summoned the sleepers to arise. Thus will it be when the voice of Christ shall be heard from heaven.|`|uLYlQMs3aa	Its saying rely on God first for all things. He will take care of us and provide for us.

9CCtt077aa	The female body is more attractive to me, but only when it's curvy or has some meat on it. However, I find an athletic male body much more more appealing than a really thin woman. Women are naturally supposed to have more fat on their bodies than men. When they diet too much, it doesn't look natural or healthy. But overall, women are much nicer to look at. <br>  <br>  Both men & women prefer to look at women, actually.

That's rathers like suggesting that because funerals have religious variations, atheists must not bury their dead or mourn socially.<br>  <br>  Or, to give another analogy, many religions have a way to eat food.  Whether the food must be specially prepared, such as in Judism, or a ritual must be performed, such as prayer before eatting, this does not make eatting a meal a religious institution.<br>  <br>  There is often an argument that, because marriage is religious, religions should be allowed to decide on gay marriage instead of the state.  This is false for the previous stated reasons.|`|Qko96VEcaa	I don't really see the relation between the two. If it were two male atheists, or two women atheist trying to marry then I could see your point. The church isn't trying to stop gays from marrying because they don't believe in god. They believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. No matter what their religion, the don't want same sex marriage. I don't think it's right to keep gays from marrying. I don't see the harm done in it. |`|bwmwF9qBaa	Marriage is a religious ceremony in the first place, and in the bible it says that man should marry woman.

However, I do not see what this has to do with atheists getting married.  Christians do not want gays to be gays because of their beliefs, and they do not want atheists to be atheists. It is not a matter of marrying or not it is a matter of their life choice that Christians believe to be wrong and immoral. I don;t know if that all makes sense but there is my opinion. |`|hMNOBYHCaa	Atheists can get married in a civil ceremony.  The churches aren't giving them the sacrament of matrimony.

Christians are worried half to death that marriage as an institution is dying off--50% divorce rate, blah blah.

I tried it once and wasn't very good at it.Scholium: if marriage is an institution, who wants to live in an institution?

A marriage between a man and a man or a woman and a woman is breaking god's law, so that's why christians are opposed to it. They're not trying to make others adopt their religion because of prop 8, their just voicing their opinion that it's wrong.

The US Constitution.<br>  The American Constitution pledges equality to all US citizens. Not allowing a certain group to marry, is denying them a basic fundamental right. Equal Rights.<br>  <br>  2. Freedom of Religion.<br>  Not only is it discrimination against the LGBT community, it's also discrimination against many religions that accept gay marriage. Just because some religions are homophobic, doesn't mean all of them are. After all, marriage was around thousands of years before the first church was even built. Today's major religions symply adopted the idea of marriage. They don't own it.<br>  <br>  3. The Family.<br>  A common argument against gay marriage is that it destroys the family structure, and that it damages children of gays mentally. This argument is COMPLETELY baseless. Most children of same sex couples are for gay marriage and are anything but mentally damaged. The vast majority of children of gay parents are reported to do well in school and go onto higher education.<br>  <br>  4. Nothing bad happened to Spain, Holland, or Canada after gay marriage became legal there.<br>  <br>  5. Children.<br>  If you care about children, then vote against proposition h8te. Regardless of whether gay couples are legally documented as married or not, they still have the right to have children, often through invitral fertilization. The only problem is, the child doesn't recieve the same benefits as a legally married couple would.<br>  <br>  6. If gay marriage is a sign of you fundies' rapture, then it's just one step closer to you all becoming saved! You aren't scared of being left behind are you? You're such great Christians after all.<br>  <br>  7. Common sense.<br>  <br>  8. Excuses.<br>  There are no logical arguments that support proposition 8, as proven through pro-h8te advertisements.<br>  (Examples: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gE5oOuf_..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gE5oOuf_...</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoMA_kcRy..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoMA_kcRy...</a><br>  Where anti-h8ters offer reasons backing their arguments, pro-h8ters merely offer excuses backing their homophobia.<br>  <br>  Copy and post this if you HATE propostion h8te and LOVE equality!|`|5cQaECAkaa	Cruddy!|`|0V0a7yijaa	well it would feel like **** of course.<br>  <br>  i live in New York but i can imagine how it must feel.|`|AA10409800	Gee, I'm sure they're just ecstatic about it.<br>  <br>  |`|LhM7rp4Gaa	i am so upset, its not like we voted on strait marraige.<br>  they should give us our rights...were not doing anything to anyone!<br>  we should love who we want.<br>  EQUALITY!|`|wWXzIPbVaa	You don't have to be gay or from California to have an opinionion.

Did Hitler understand this choice?  Was he just insane?  Who knows, so the possibility is there.  Yes, God will forgive everybody who SINCERELY asks and is truly repentant.

NCRfZRopaa	I don't think it's in there, but all their argument is really Appeal to Tradition: a logical fallacy. Besides, why do we even care or try to make laws of what goes on in the bedroom of two consenting adults and try to keep them from marriage?<br>  <br>  Again, I see a lot of circular logic and a bunch of Bible verses. Do we really follow the laws of the Bible today?

It would be pretty silly to say, "don't sin, but become involved in an arrangement which, by definition, requires you commit the sin which you are not allowed to commit".<br>  <br>  <br>  2) I am Christian, but we can not base our laws on God's law.<br>  <br>  Of course we can.  The separation of church and state - in the U.S., at least - revolves around the forcing of people to adopt a specific religion, *not* around the forcing of people to abide by a certain morality.  The last is most *certainly* permitted under the U.S. separation of church and state.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) making athiests abide by the commandments goes against what America was founded on<br>  <br>  Quite the contrary.  Only making atheists become Christians - or to worship as a Christian - is against what America was founded on.  When it comes to legal regulations in the U.S., majority rules - regardless of the foundations of that morality.<br>  <br>  <br>  4) Also, we have politicians, and as long as it is legal to be an elected official, we, as a society are giving our approval to the liar lifestyle. Are we not?<br>  <br>  Well, no...but certainly it *allows* for lying.  However, we can imagine a change of laws that would allow us to hook up candidates to a lie detector during campaign speeches - or even better, just a cultural revolution that would make it impossible for someone to be elected who was *not* so connected.  So, democracy does not really *approve* the liar lifestyle, it just rewards those who are able to lie successfully without being caught.<br>  <br>  Evidence:  when a candidate is caught in a whopper, he usually loses the election.  If society approved of lying, the most obvious and careless liar would always win.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/</a>|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	We being made male and female is the very reason for marriage:<br>  <br>  "Have you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, `For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?

Leviticus was actually a condemnation of "sex for power", and was also a part of the Holiness Code which is not binding to modern Christians.  Corinthians was a mistranslation of the word "malakee" which means "morally weak".  Timothy was an admonishment against male prostitution, not loving same-sex relationships.  The word "paraphysin" in Romans means implies action which is uncharacteristic, so it actually instructs people not to have sex which would go against their own nature (meaning heterosexuals shouldn't sleep with the same sex and homosexuals shouldn't sleep with the opposite sex).
x0srLUzsaa	hmmm interesting.<br>  <br>  i've always known "losing your virginity" to be when a girl has sex with a girl and during that he sticks his penis into her vagina boom there. with gay guys i believe that it is the same way. once a guy sticks his penis into your butthole and fxxks you or you do him then guess what you are not a virgin anymore.<br>  <br>  some people out there see just having oral sex as a way of losing your virginity.<br>  <br>  also i don't believe that you need to reach a climax to have lost your virginity because if you think about it, how many people have had orgasms way before they had sex, just by themselves and they are virgins.|`|hJAtgbb8aa	That is not true.<br>  You will lose your virginity only if you have had sex.<br>  That might be Anal Sex, or Penis and Vagina sex.<br>  <br>  Oral sex or mutual masturbation does not count, because to lose your virginity, you will either have to penetrate someone, or get penetrated by someone.<br>  <br>  Some people say a if a girl's hymen is broken, she is not a virgin because she had sex and so her hymen broke.<br>  BUT it is not necessary that the hymen should break due to sexual intercourse.<br>  If they did, then there are a lot of young girl who have lost their virginity to Tampons, Bicycles, Fingers (masturbating) or dildos<br>  <br>  So, if you have had sex, you are not a virgin....doesn't matter if you were the Top or the Bottom.<br>  <br>  About holes...well...Glory Holes can make you a non virgin! lol<br>  <br>  <br>  You are a virgin if you consider yourself as a virgin. <br>  Simple!<br>  <br>  *Best Wishes*<br>  ?? ?ǐvǐ??

It may be okay within other cultures/races.|`|1Vih78dZaa	You don't say where you live, but in around half the States, it's legal for _first_ cousins to marry (in the United Kingdom, it is legal for first cousins to marry). I believe most churches do not bar marriage between second cousins, so the closeness of blood-ties is not an issue here in legal terms. In other words, you couldn't be charged with incest for having sex with a second cousin.<br>  <br>  The age of the girl might be a legal issue, since there are places where the age of consent is more than 16.<br>  <br>  So it's probably "okay" for second cousins of the ages you give to have sex in legal terms. However, this might possibly be very "not-okay" for all sorts of reasons to do with power relationships, emotional maturity, family reactions, friend's opinions and so on that would apply when any 20 year-old guy and 16 year-old girl get physically involved.|`|AA11235749	It's based on culture rather than physicality.

bbb270e49b73fd8d3e6d685789e2656aaa	yes there is a HUGE problem with that. Judgment is the entire reason men are called to repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ. If he does not believe hell exists, then that is a very big indication that he is not soundly saved (only God knows his heart but I am basing this on what you have told me). In Romans 3:23, it says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Sin is the absence of God or righteousness and therefore, God hates it. It is extremely evil, which is why He gave the ten commandments, to show us how short we have fallen of His glory and our need for the savior. If there is no heaven and no hell, then there is no need for a savior, which is what you do when you become a Christian, is make Jesus your savior and Lord, repent from your sins and put your entire faith in Him. Romans 6:23 says that the wages of sin is death. The death referred in this verse is physical as well as spiritual. this spiritual death is hell. If there is no hell then there is no need for salvation and it goes to show that he does not believe the Bible is the inherent word of God, which is another big indication that he is not saved. In the same verse that says that the wages of sin is death, it also says that the gift of God is eternal life, or heaven. How he could be a Christian and not believe in heaven or hell is not possible based just on what you have said. The Bible makes it very clear that the judgment for breaking God's law is punishment and Hell and the accepting of His free gift of salvation through repentance and faith gives you everlasting life. If there is no change, no fruit of a changed life style, that is a very good indication that he is lost. If his family doesn't go to church, does he ask them if they can give him a ride or what is the situation exactly?|`|XuXl7MFoaa	i'm jewish but growing up i had a best friend, my neighbor. we were best friends for almost ten years and then she suddenly started trying to convert me to christianity. this ended up destroying our friendship.<br>  <br>  why do you care if your friend believes in heaven and hell? his religion is his own personal decision. what if i discriminated against you because you DO believe in it? if i were your friend and you tried to find scriptures and stuff to make me believe, i would be more likely to not believe.|`|AA10409800	It's important that he is free to believe whatever he wishes, and you are not compelled to 'save' him.

The book contains the teachings of Jesus Christ to the people in the Americas as well as recounting Christ's personal ministry among the people of Nephi after his resurrection.[1] Mormons believe that the Book of Mormon is another scriptural witness of Jesus Christ that is comparable to the Bible[2], which they also believe to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.[2] The book gets its name from Mormon, the prophet who, according to the text, abridged the record during the 4th century.<br>  <br>  According to the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the earliest published usages of the term "Mormon" to describe believers in the Book of Mormon was in 1833 by the Louisville (Kentucky) Daily Herald in an article, "The Mormons and the Anti-Mormons".[3]<br>  |`|pfNnuD5saa	I like their clean life styles and the way they care for family.

vPnNaWQyaa	They just wanna be cool, go with the flow and play the game! it's male nature.|`|AA11412999	LOL.. uh...what about the women who bring it up to their husbands?  It does happen.<br>  <br>  Swingers have always been around, Venom M.  It's been called by other names, but it's everywhere.  It predates the Judaeo-Christian framework that our society was built upon and has survived all through it in one form or another.  It's not evil, it's not gross, it's not a sin.  It's just a different way of doing things.<br>  <br>  Swingers are not bored with one another...and if they are, they don't stay swingers - or together - for very long.  It is necessary to have a very strong, stable relationship in order to do it, and the people involved also need to be very strong and secure as individuals and not prone to jealousy and self-doubt.<br>  <br>  To answer the last question, people get into swinging not because they're bored with their partner, but because they're bored with the game.  Imagine playing nothing but checkers for the rest of your life.  Even if it's your favorite game in the world, 200 rounds of the same game gets a little stale after a while through no fault of the players.  Suddenly one gets a brilliant idea: Let's invite Jack and Jill over and we can play cards!  So you invite friends over and have a thoroughly enjoyable evening playing a new game with new rules and new challenges, and enjoying the company of friends.  When your company goes home, though, you enjoy the quiet intimacy of the evening alone together that much more.  To put it simply, it's just more fun.  <br>  <br>  PS: The wives or girlfriends of male swingers are treated like royalty and they call the shots.  You want equal opportunity?  You want women's lib?  Try telling a female swinger that she's "oppressed" and see what SHE says.  You'll hear differently.|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	Clueless.  Completely clueless.<br>  <br>  Swingers include others in their sex lives.  They're honest enough to know they have fantasies, and intelligent enough to explore them.<br>  <br>  It's a recreational activity.  Means no more than pairs tennis.|`|6sns33traa	Ah, the common misconception that it's wife swapping. In fact if you were in the swinger lifestyle you'd find it's more often than not "husband swapping".  In swinging women really call the shots.<br>  <br>  A poll on The Swingers Board forums asking "Whose idea was it to swing" revealed that 70% of the time it was the man that brought it up. But that means that 30% of the time the woman did. And as any swinger will tell you "It may be the man that gets them into swinging, but it's the woman that keeps them there."<br>  <br>  You'll find that in fact those real swingers are not bored with each other at all. They have a very good and active sex life together and all they are doing is sharing the overflow with others. Swinging isn't about replacement sex, it's about additional sex.  Living-out sexual fantasies. In swinger couples they both have sexual fantasies that require more than two people in the room to fulfill, and they both are secure enough in themselves (meaning "not the jealous type") and each other to live-out those fantasies.<br>  <br>  There is much more to swinging than first meets the eye.

b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	Tryng to live in the closet can make you sick. Do whatever you can to get out of your present living situation so you can have a real life. Be your authentic self. Get out of the closet. No one can tell you to come out until you're ready, but the sooner you come out, the sooner you'll be happy. Of course you feel like you're lying about who you are..... you are. And you feel compelled to 'come out' because you want to be honest with your family and friends. It's going to amaze you when you do come out, because you'll want to tell everybody. It's like this big weight has finally been lifted off your shoulders.Before another day passes, start looking into changes you can make in your life: job, home, school, etc. Get going. Be happy with your life. <br>  I've been OUT since 1977 ( I was married and 27 at the time I finally got it.) I realized I had to get out of the marriage as quickly as possible and get on with my life. I went to the gay center to get a little support and I've never looked back or regreted it. My best to you as you begin your journey. Come on OUT!!  HUGS!   <br>      |`|ZRQvrbtGaa	I am not gay, or a lesbian and I do not know your situation...<br>  <br>  But I just wanted to let you know you seem like a very strong person, and I am so sorry that you live in such a hateful environment.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend you do whatever your heart tells you; don't feel guilty because of other people, but at the same time, do not let hate limit who you are as a person.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck, I'm sorry for your struggles.|`|LxgykSqGaa	stay closeted until you are safe.<br>  <br>  why would you need to be at risk?<br>  Personal safety comes first, regardless of anything else.|`|897f9782bd9356ff775df4cf6a07496faa	That's something very private, I don't see the need to announce it to the world. Do whatever you are comfortable with.|`|qFYMPUe5aa	Some people stay closeted for their entire lives, and I for one, wouldn't suggest this.  I understand your need to stay in the closet until you can "manage somewhere else," and I think that this is a fine idea; if you plan on moving away shortly or something similar there's no need to drop something on the people in your community and create more drama then necessary before you leave.  However, if this period of time is going to be more or close to a year, I would suggest that you come out.  As you said, you're already beginning to feel guilty about not telling people, and the longer you wait the worse it will make you feel about yourself.  By hiding something, you naturally begin to feel ashamed of it over time.  You should never feel like you need to repress any part of your identity, because in the long run all it will result in is you feeling worse about yourself.<br>  <br>  So in short, don't bother coming out if you plan to move somewhere else soon, and come out there instead.  However, if you're staying put for awhile, then you should come out because it will make you feel bad if you don't.|`|AA11594069	Staying in the closet can have many negative effects. Besides the effects that concern you on a personal level, it is detrimental to other homosexuals and to the greater society. Every gay person who is open about their sexuality makes it easier for the next gay person to come out. The gay-unfriendly place you live in will never stop being gay-unfriendly if every homosexual moves away to avoid the confrontation. I'm not saying it will be easy, but I believe it is more responsible to act to change the thinking of your community than to leave your community in favor of one that thinks the way you do. Don't let people get away with hate. Don't let them win.

Come out and don the ruby slippers and beat your horn and show your A**!"<br>  <br>  Let me give you a bit of perspective here regarding your situation okay?  I'm being kind, not being mean at all; trying to help out......<br>  <br>  Where you are at, apparently, is  what you can manage for the time being.  You have already accepted that you are a gay man; and just saying that here tells me it is so.  Forget all the hype, it is who you are secondary to the fact that you are a man.<br>  <br>  Throw out the label thing.  You're not "closeted".  You're not "hiding".   You're not "guilty" of anything my friend.....<br>  <br>  You're a man who has to deal with your life as it is on life's terms and for the time being, that means you can't "ACT UP" and don a pink feather boa and march up and down Main Street where you live your life.<br>  <br>  You may NEVER feel that way to be honest.  <br>  <br>  Even in the GAYEST of locales.<br>  <br>  You're being responsible, doing what you have to do until you can afford to break out and move to a more friendly place and that really is okay.  It is, and it would be nice to hear from other men, gay or straight here who would add to what I've tried to convey to you here.<br>  <br>  You are a man, you're gay, but you have to live your life where you're at and do what you have to do to achieve your own goals and arrive at a place that allows you to live without having to deal with the stress of excessive homophobic prejudice.  That's a LOT of added stress that you've already taken on in your head and you need to quit feeling guilty for being who you are as a human being.....<br>  <br>  Dump the labels, live your life, be happy right now as you know how, and later on when you can re-locate, you're gonna be a better man for the struggles you're experiencing now. <br>  <br>  Trust me on that.  Gay or straight.  We all have living situations we have to deal with FOR NOW.<br>  <br>  But better days are ahead.  Hang in there buddy......you're gonna be okay......<br>  |`|hWak8D0Aaa	Its all about the person. I'm closeted to my family, because while I know they love me I also know that they just cannot understand the idea of me being gay. I'm at peace with this and am very comfortable all the same with my family. I am out to the rest of my social world. So I can say with certainty that one can stay -at least somewhat- closeted.<br>  <br>  But you seem uncomfortable. You feel guilty. You "don't mind staying in the closet", but feel "compelled to come out". Is it just where you live that's gay unfriendly, or is it your social circle too? Could you perhaps come out to some of your close friends/family? Maybe that would relieve the feelings of deceit.|`|2qlYfFysaa	If you feel that you will benefit yourself better by staying closeted than by all means do it until you can come out comfortably on your own terms. It's never a good feeling to have to lie about a huge and important part of your life. You can go crazy from it! I pick and choose who I tell my orientation or anything personal along those lines. If they can't guess just from my appearance then they're oblivious. |`|ZF7H0JH8aa	UUUUHHHHH...<br>  My x boy friend :(|`|KXQVRQdjaa	There's no real reason you can't, but I imagine it will be exhausting.

Good luck.|`|uD1UFdRsaa	I totally understand where you are coming from because to my family I'm still closeted bisexual and I tend to stay that way, at least for now. I might decide to tell my brother and his wife..maybe..but they would have to keep it a secret from my traditional / homophobic family. <br>  <br>  I've only decided to come out to my closest friends and this other chick whom i consider my sister in a way, but that's it so far. And so far they haven't done me wrong or let me down :) <br>  <br>  I don't know if I would ever come out to my parents (esp. my mum) cause I'm too scared it would break her heart. I feel too selfish if I do. I don't want my other family members or anyone else to judge her, she's already been let down too many times by them. *sigh* Sometimes it's not always yourself you have to think of. I won't feel any better if I tell them anyways. <br>  <br>  I do know what you mean about feeling guilty sometimes when people make comments. There's this guy at work I desperately wanted to blurt out a couple of times that i liked girls too cos he would always talk about them and I'd have to just listen and nod. lol. I wanna join in!<br>  <br>  Anyways I'm blabbing on too much. <br>  Hope this helped :) <br>  
lh2H5oSOaa	Yes. I agree with you that there is  a lack of serious debate. Because what Christianity has to offer are girls, kids and ordinary people with little or no knowledge of their own religion.

Myself, I could care less what you worship.  What bothers atheists about theists, is when theists try to push their beliefs on everyone else -- Christians do that WAY more than muslims.  Muslims, as a rule, mind their own business.  Christians on the other hand, actively try to insert themselves in MY government, making MY laws, and teaching their personal beliefs to MY children at school, tell me WHO I can marry, etc etc etc.  That is why atheists have a bigger problem with christians than other religions, it is because as a group, you need to learn how to mind your own damned business.|`|0DqTd733aa	small mind talk about nothing.<br>  smart mind talk what you seek.(wisdom)<br>  SO..that is why you see Y/A religion and culture full of immaturity..or petty fight.<br>  and/or stupid questions, get stupid answer,  vs having a healthy conversation, for folks to grow wiser.|`|KAiHiHkGaa	Because the people that are not talking about Islam are in countries where it is not the predominant religion.|`|AA10810084	lol see, all of the arguments against islam have been refuted so yea take that and live with it :-)<br>  Most atheists here are X-christians and they can relate to Christianity more than they can to any other religion|`|hFSqYxgRaa	*  Arguing with a Muslim over religion is like talking to a baboon's a$$.|`|DvoP2aawaa	My thoughts are that people don't know enough about the religion or the people to make fun of it, and there aren't many muslims on here to ask questions or answer them!|`|jtEOvGKsaa	You just answered your own question.<br>  <br>  "because there are just so few Muslims to argue with"|`|p10niY6Faa	No thanks.|`|Cbn4gx8Taa	Ask and I will answer to the best of my ability.|`|aAQP4asJaa	Be careful.

Those of you who judge Muslims based on what you hear or read from the media are seriously idiots. Well, maybe all those news are 100% true. None of us know seriously. But did you even think that these people are probably extremists and most people are not like that. Quit your racism and anti-Islam crap will you.

They give the muslims a pass because they think they are slapping us in the face by not addressing islam. What they don't realize is that the muslims will go after atheists faster than Christians or Jews.

Sexual orientation has nothing to do with my question -- I'm talking about fearing rejection from them for any reason.  If they're truly your friends, then this news should not anger them -- and if someone IS displeased, that is THEIR problem to deal with, not yours.

As I read it, you were "claiming" to be bisexual simply to appear trendy, but now you've decided you're bisexual because there are supposedly fun things such as flags and celebratory days -- so, have you actually had a revelation about yourself, or are you merely tempted by a few minor perks?  Also, if you've been claiming that you're bisexual all this time, then you have no reason to fear your friends -- since they've "known" about your sexuality all this time, they've obviously all accepted the fact since they're still hanging around you.|`|SFKz2lgqaa	Theres nothing wrong with it, so dont be worried or confused. i think it is very brave of you to come out clean and be honest with yourself. as far adn communties and all are concerned- i dont see the importance of joining them or not. because as long as you know who you are, and those you love around you do- then you need not have to prove yourself by joining societies or celebrating various things. stay headstrong, and those around you will definately accept you for who you are. at the end of the day- your the same person, it doesnt matter which gender you fall in love with.|`|zJa9diKHaa	Be free, be yourself, and be happy...In my own life only two opinions count and that's my moms because she loves me and supports me no matter what...and my own....and if my mom didn't approve then only my opinion would matter, but i'm lucky.

God said what God has brought together, let no man put asunder<br>  <br>   Matthew 19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.. |`|XKecXwZkaa	They were each other's true mates. Now they have new ones.|`|AA10024194	Nope, we choose them.... So choose very very carefully.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	Love is blind, and God is free will.|`|TdI17FeFaa	i will have to agree with Quiddity|`|9Zr6rULIaa	I think that through free will we make the decision to follow what God wants for us or what we want. But the real point of marriage is that you have to choose if you are going to make a commitment to grow together and with God. It sounds like your parents gave up on that commitment. But I do say that if one person is left by their spouse; there is nothing wrong with God putting someone else in their lives.<br>  <br>  When you have lost your husband or wife in death or life and you find someone new, it doesn't change that fact that you loved them. I don't think there is one true person you can only love. But I do believe until death does you part. You can't stop living life though if your spouse doesn't share your commitment.|`|ENrF89iuaa	if u pray about it he will find a mate for u. God gave them a mate but they made a human mistake(not Gods fault but theres). Ur parents were probably a perfect couple but a couple fights made them apart.|`|AA11594069	I don't know if there is a right or wrong answer to your question. Only God knows for sure.

AA11235749	Human beings are bisexual. But the sexual orientation is because of which part is active. If you are active for both man and woman than you are bisexual. It is quite natural.|`|LN20hBMyaa	there really ain't a easy place to meet others of your preference without attending some sort of function that caters to that quality. <br>  Only thing I can think of would be a concert of some kind or a party.|`|og8ijRhzaa	gurl.com<br>  <br>  <br>  i put it in my search engine and that came up<br>  make sure you spell gurl with an U and not an I<br>  if you spell it with an I then you'll just get porn|`|QuyldNgyaa	in dunno what to say...|`|6440ba515b5e4017d8e5d3688ed08b96aa	may sound like a strange answer, but do you have access to the kids help phone line, or something like it? (# should be in the front of a phone book) they might know - they would be fielding calls from youth all over with similar questions. are you in a city or somewhere more remote?|`|4mzbkw07aa	I don't believe in bi-sexuality...it's like a person saying they're in love with 2 different people.  Like really?  Pick a gender.  At least you're admitting that you're just in it for a hook-up.....you're a child just looking for some dirty trouble.  You shouldn't be sleeping around at all at your age.
joE5yXXaaa	Wow. You seems to be extremely curious. I think you can only be 100% sure if you are bi if you've been with girls. And you can't experience with girls if you are still going out with your bf (you could do it behind his back tho but I don't suggest that).<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to your bf about this. You could ask him to spend some time apart. If he asks for the reason; you could be honest to him about your bi-curiosity or some made up excuses are fine too I suppose. Then you will have some time to reflect and decide if you want to be with him or break up with him for the sake of your curiosity.|`|AA11235749	Human beings are bisexual. There is no doubt. For example, your question is enough. You have boy friend and your eagerness to have girl partner is increasing. What is your age, I don't know. But, just as you are open up with boy friends in the same way you can open up with girls. Slowly you can meet your partner. But do not abuse.|`|s5RQvM7Daa	contrary to kisskiss, I don't think you have to necessarily sleep with a girl to know you're bi.  If you are attracted to particular girls and want a relationship with one, then there's your answer.  But anyway, that's now what you're asking.<br>  If you're happy with your boyfriend, it seems a little selfish to break up with him or go behind his back just because of your growing "curiosity".  If you aren't really into your boyfriend, then fine - go ahead and experience the female!  Ultimately though, you have to consider your feelings and what the right thing to do is by you.

1aY6H3h1aa	You are right. It doesn't make sense and people should be more compassionate and empathetic. It's like the Dionne Farris song..'Before I am black, before I am woman, before I am short, before I am young..before I am African.. I am human. Because I am black, because I am woman, because I am short, because I am young, because i am African..I am human.' Fill in your own what ever in that song. It's what I teach my kids..esp. when I see them getting nervous about interacting with anyone different, be it a wheel chair or older person .."what are we all first?" So hopefully if I do my job well they"ll be 3 more open  clear visioned people in the world!|`|357b3062135e1b05d63f799aa91f9d3eaa	People have always had a fear of the unknown and most racist people do not know any other race personally so they are afraid of what they might find. Growing up that way also makes it hard when you hear all your life that these are bad people you start to believe it. It took me until I realized that my father was not always right before I overcame this and now have some awesome black friends. It is heritage that keeps this around we have to escape that which holds us back from the truth. There is truly only one race and that is the human one.|`|Ed7dbCOsaa	A latent or overt sense of inferiority is the answer to your question.|`|VpR6qvb5aa	What triggers a person to become a racist?<br>  Life experience.<br>  <br>  Quite the opposite of "ignorance", which seems to be the politically correct answer here.|`|8342eb2791b4f481bc2b31b4c0d0dbccaa	Life experience.<br>  It takes a lot to overcome the pain of life experience.  For example, as a little girl I was hit, kicked, and stripped the clothes off of my butt simply due to the color of my skin.  I did not understand why someone would do this to me.  They were racist.  I now understand that they were taking out their hate on me because I was weak and I was "there" and not because of me personally.  So therefore I can move on, and I can try NOT to be like them.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Unfortunately it comes from racist parents who instill this type of unfortunate behavior to their children. When you watch i.e. the KKK, and children are wearing those white cloaks, it's because of their parents,<br>  when you see children in the middle east carrying weapons to kill people it's because of their parents. Racism is taught at a very young age to hate others unlike themselves. Tragic isn't it?|`|3wyxasucaa	"What triggers a person to become a racist?"<br>  <br>  You need to understand things from the racist's point of view, and let go of your victim hood.  The racist thinks the way he does because he is consistently wronged by the members of a particular group or groups.|`|i0OVwfcyaa	You want racists to be logical?  Good luck with that.|`|AA11883252	Good point. Personally I wouldn't change my race even if I could.|`|q26iYJVOaa	For some people it is ingnorance, for others it is their upbringing.  When you are exposed to certain ideas from a young age it is hard to change them later in life.  This doesn't apply to any one race, or any one issue.  Just as the white child raised by racist parents impedes progress, the black child raised by parents who preach that the white man keeps them down stifles progress as well. |`|rLRd1Y4Caa	I dont see colors...<br>  <br>  Reasons people do:<br>  <br>  -ignorance<br>  -fear of what they dont know<br>  -lack of education (skin color gets more dark/ more pigment, if the country has more sun, to protect the skin)<br>  -lack of smart parents/ right upbringing<br>  -stupidness<br>  -lack of braincells<br>  -lack of knowledge<br>  -absence of a brain<br>  -no ability to think<br>  -past experiences ( I was robbed once by a black guy, so every black guy is a robber)<br>  <br>  I dont know....I dont get it either !!!<br>  Im just glad I dont think like they do !!<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|6t4992sZaa	Ignorant people.<br>  You're correct they are dumb they don't think about that. They should go back to grade 1.<br>  <br>  Racists:: Didn't you learn in school that all human beings have they same bodies??<br>  With different skin textures.??<br>  <br>  Common why the stupidity? It's just color. Why hate people based on skin color. Look how SHALLOW you are RACISTS!!.<br>  <br>  |`|AA11235749	The person himself/herself may not be racist or anything else. It is the cultural upbringing of the persons determined whether he/she is racist or not. If somebody transcend from his/her culture, then he/she may not be racist.|`|0hsh000waa	A lot of racist are angry people anyway and they have bad experiences with people outside of their race. They generalize because of those experiences and they go out looking for stereotypes in other races.|`|7qF6R7d5aa	Fear, Anger, shallow perception of things, naivety, brainwashed, false culture, miseducation, misunderstanding.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	Well, their stupidity becomes so strong that they can't control it.|`|8Yizk4Qtaa	i dont know but i got a trigger i could pull if any of those racist peeps come around me playin'
AA11155526	Do we???<br>  <br>  Almost all my friends are men.. We share the same interests, hobbies, (my study is all most men only) etc etc<br>  <br>  In my opinion we don't avoid men.. Sometimes I can't stand men, but for the most, I operate the same as they so that makes it more easy to hang out with each other..<br>  on the other hand, I have some gay friends, and yeah, we are like a small group, and if you are not gay you cannot really join.... like, they miss the understanding.. So, I understand that that girl hangs out with other (possibly?)gay girls? Not sure you ment that with your story|`|7R7e6yX5aa	 Alot of them have been harmed by men or had really bad experiences with men or lack of them in their family.|`|vrKous92aa	There are men I avoid because I'm afraid of being judged harshy by them. That could be a self-esteem issue on my part. There are guys who approach me and I get along really well with them. In general, I love men, as long as they're not arrogant and judgmental.|`|kNkORi3Aaa	That's a raging generality. However *A* lesbian who prefers the company of men may not be avoiding them, it may just be her preference. Not all gay men love women, love being around women or have primarily female friends. Perhaps she feels most comfortable around women rather than men. Maybe she had a bad experience. However unless she is mean or outright rude to males, she might NOT dislike them. Simply not being friends with men doesn't mean she doesn't like them.|`|AA11235749	It may be cultural grouping rather than sexual. I think lesbians also have to coordinate with men. On the otherhand, women also are bisexual so they may call you one day. Wait for that day.|`|grQoQUYGaa	i think a lot of girls become "lesbians" because they get fed up with men, that is probably where the hostility and avoidance is coming from. just my opinion..|`|xboDUtI2aa	Because they are sexist against men.|`|dGb6gyenaa	as a lesbian i have more male friends than female. but its only because i have more in common with them, we check out girls together, dont show emotions, and usually enjoy same things. my few lesbian friends im a lot closer to though, its a different type of bond. all my guy friends hit on me all the time, get me drunk, take advantage. it gets tiring after a while and i sometimes give in most of the time i let it be a crush for a while but either way i lose them as friends. your example is a little dramatic, but same idea. and i think guy men only hang out with women more because guys always have this idea that their gay guy friend is hitting on them, when really hes probably just acting like a girl would in a situation. gaydar does exist and a gay guy knows when your not into him. |`|o8fzAI5taa	I tend to avoid women more.<br>  I think I have more friends that are male.<br>  In fact,I am drawn to friendly people and only tend to avoid when peole seem unfriendly or hostile or they make me feel socially awkward in some way.|`|gPY7XpTJaa	Their sexist....They probably had a boyfriend that cheated on them so now their bitter and hate all men as a result.<br>  <br>  A lot of women are like that nowadays...|`|eXbBD8hgaa	Because  the girl will give her what she wants not the men.<br>  <br>  And they no have reason to approach men.|`|l4MOrcfZaa	Maybe she doesn't need any guy friends..after all you say she has gf's of her own...

It's just no longer important|`|JXH9vbs8aa	well it hurts at first. it gets better
dDdkYpDzaa	Well, first of all, you need to calm down a little.  I know it can get frustrating to have a neighbor that bugs you, but just the statement that she "looks like she doesn't want someone living behind her" is pretty telling about the situation.  You have obviously been upset by this woman and you need to calm down before you deal with it.  You need to talk to the lanlords about it, but if she's been there long they will either believe her or know she is a problem person.<br>  <br>  She called the cops at 2 am.  Now as a person who used to hang out with bartenders a lot, I know that coming home late and trying to clam down for bed is hard, and having friends over at that time may seem quiet to her, but may not really be quiet to someone who has been in bed and sleeping for 4 hours already.  Quiet talking would not have woken the woman up, so whether it was laughing or the door bell ringing, or possibly the dog barking when they got home, someone woke her up.  I doubt she was standing around the corner waiting to catch your wife having friends over.  <br>  Try to be understanding.  She may be very sensitive to noises, or the walls may let the noise through more than you think - just because you never hear her, doesn't mean she never hears you.<br>  <br>  That all being said, I have never reported a disturbance such as a dog barking or a few loud noises.  I have called once or twice when there was a loud party - with music and yelling and talking under my window - for several hours.  She does sound sensitive and she may just sleep lightly too.  She needs to be understanding too.  That is part of living in an apartment.  If she can't stand noises, she needs to get a place without neighbors or a place with older walls.<br>  <br>  Explain the situation to the landlord, send your neighbor a NICE and SINCERE note trying to apologize for the inconvenience, and try to keep the get togethers to a minimum for now.  Or try to have them in the day.  Or try to go to another room.  Something.<br>  Good luck|`|AA10409800	The worst part of being in this type of situation is that the law in some ways really isn't on your side.  The police handle these types of 'disturbance' calls as nuisances and would rather be doing anything else than having to come to your apartment complex and talk to anyone about stupid barking dog complaints.  However, it's the law, and they have to respond to EVERY call they get.  This is why they hate it so much.  So, rather than try to find the truth, or solve the problem, they treat it like an annoyed parent treats fighting siblings--they don't care who started it or who's in the right...they just want SILENCE.  So, because of that, they'll side with your neighbor, because they know that they have to come back if she complains again.<br>  <br>  Sucks, doesn't it?|`|18RphOP6aa	Go up to her and ask her why she is making these complaints about your wife and that if she has a problem to talk to your wife first. Then  tell her if she does not stop making these bogus complaints that you will have no choice but to contact a lawyer and sue her for slander.<br>  Make sure you take a recorder and that you say this in a polite mature manner.|`|8mlPPT1Naa	Sounds like that lady is to woried about what you and your family are doing and complaining then anything else. If i were you i would talk to you other neibors around you about what is happeneing and see if she has done this to anyone else and if not then i would explain to them what she is doing to you and see if anything did come down to it where she kept complaining that the other neibors would voudge for you and your family that there is no noise coming from your apartment and mabe that would get the point accrost to your lanlord that its not you guys. Or even if you wanted to you could try and talk to your unfriendly neibor and see what is going on and why she always complains about you guys and what could make the situation better. but if you decide to do that dont snap at her or seem like your trying to argue or what not with her because then she could take affence and things could get alot worse.|`|EHBX1F54aa	I'm sorry that you are dealing with this situation!  So many of us have had bad neighbors and landlords.  I hope your situation turns out well!<br>  <br>  I think that you are under the attack of a clever, manipulative woman.  She obviously dislikes you or your wife (after all, she's putting in lots of time with those complaints!).  I'd guess, being a woman, that she's probably jealous of your wife and is doing what she can to piss her off.  Regrettably, this woman seems to know how to work these situations so that she looks like the sweet, reputable one.<br>  <br>  You will have to be just as cunning.  For each complaint she files, get testimony from your other neighbors confirming that at the time/date specified, you were minding your own business, quietly.  Start killing your neighbor with thoughtfulness - ask her if it'd bother her if you vacuum / entertain friends / do laundry / sneeze, each and every time.  Chances are, if you can't get her to be sensible, you can at least drive her crazy with your newfound concern for her happiness.  :)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

I guess though, you shouldn't say all your doors are closed. You have your two little girls and husband with you. Be together, have good times together, all the good times you can squeeze into life. Let it be a picnic at the park with a blanket and some bubbles. Let it be a walk down the beach, staring at the horizons. We all share the same problem with money these days, but in a way, it sheds light on the wonderful free things. What do your daughters like to do? Buy them a box of crayons and ask them to draw you something every day you are together, to cherish every day and memory that you still can hold on to. Life is terminal as well. Christmas may be hard, but don't forget the true meaning. It won't matter to them how much you did or didn't spend. Just be happy.  You could build them a cute little house with some cardboard boxes and paint it for them. Tell them they just missed Santa, but that he left that for them. I remember my mom once said that, lol. Clothes, children do need clothes. Do you know how to sew? Fabric is cheap if you find some at nearby swap meets and inexpensive shops.

You might consider calling a local Wal-Mart and see about their toys for tots program.  You should also talk to a pastor in person and tell them your situation.  Thats what Churches are there for.  They are supposed to help.  Not just have some big program to sign up for and if you miss it then you're out of luck.  If thats the case try a smaller Church and tell them everything that you just said.  If a Church turns you away after that then there is something wrong.  <br>  Praying for you and yours.  I have two nephews that are terminal too.  It's absolutely heart breaking.  And I don't know how it works there but here you get denied for SS and you reapply.  It takes about three times to get accepted and then after that you get all the back pay from the first time he applied.  <br>  Hope I've been of some help and I'll be looking for other answers for you.

AA11412999	I'm a swinger myself (or used to be), so I don't know if my answer is welcome, but here goes.<br>  <br>  The behaviour you're describing is ENT?RELY inappropriate!  We have some very simple and very concrete rules that are widely accepted as the default behaviour code.  For example, don't sh*t where you eat.  In other words, don't get involved with your neighbours, your kid's teacher, your best friends, your coworkers or - for God's sake - never your supervisors or employees!  Also bad: getting involved with cheaters, because it invites unnecessary potential drama should the other half find out and show up on your doorstep with an axe or sawed-off shotgun.  And the Golden Rule of swinging: No means No.  It doesn't mean you get to ask why, or try again, or try asking a different way.  It means you smile and courteously disengage yourself from conversation with a pleasant "Have a good evening."  It also implies that the default is "No"unless otherwise specified.  In other words, it is NOT okay to put your hands on another person unless it has been explicitly invited.  Drugs and and alcohol are two more no-nos as they impair judgment and cause us to regret our actions in the morning.  If it can't be done sober, it shouldn't be done at all<br>  <br>  Your reaction to this unfortunate experience has been intensely traumatic.  I'm really sorry that this happened to you.  It sounds like you had some very strong feelings about swinging before this hapened and then had those feelings multiplied exponentially when you had the bad luck of running into this seedy bunch.<br>  <br>  I would say that the first step is to realize that their bad behaviour is not your fault.  As soon as you find yourself in another situation like the last one, confront them.  Ask, "?re you swingers?"  If they answer yes, don't flip out on them, just inform them calmly and simply that you are getting the feeling that are making sexual passes at you; is this true?  Either way, let them know you are NOT a swinger and you are not interested in exploring that.  Let them know that their behaviour is making you very uncomfortable and is putting you in a difficult position and you would appreciate it if they would take it down a notch.  This isn't being rude; it's just being assertive and if they can't appreciate a woman being assertive and standing up for herself this way, I wouldn't worry about being rude to them.'<br>  <br>  Don't worry about your professional reputation.  If they persist, a call to your union rep or the labour board puts THEM in the hot seat for sexual harrassment, not you.  That's your ace in the hole.<br>  <br>  If you find that you can't resolve your trauma at being sexually assaulted, I'd suggest seeking the advice of a good therapist to help you sort that out.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps a bit.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I'm inclined to agree with Lucius Scribbens: it also occurred to me that your boyfriend may have had something to do with their aggressiveness.  Do you think it's possible that he encouraged them?  It doesn't really shift the blame.   It would just mean that instead of having two clueless people to deal with, you have three.|`|MmtSX4saaa	I would call the police and complaint.|`|KYdg8tpUaa	Just firmly state in whatever way you feel necessary to get the point over that you are NOT interested in what they are trying to do!!! If they cross the line, you can file charges..you shouldnt have to be harrassed like that, and that women was wrong for putting you in that situation..she should have simply asked if yall were interested in that without basically trying to corner you into it..|`|P3BwONTlaa	Just tell them I'm sure they'll get the picture.|`|6sns33traa	First, these people aren't real swingers.  Real swinger couples don't pursue non-swingers because it will do nothing but cause drama. When there are thousands of other real swingers to chose from that are looking for the same thing they are, why go there with non-swingers?  It's like fishing in a dried-up pond.<br>  <br>  It sounds like these people had about as much experience swinging as you do.  It sounds like they were stretching and looking for someone to swing with, and honestly I feel your boyfriend could have had something to do with it himself. Maybe he wanted to swing also and set you up thinking that once you got there and got some wine in you that you could be persuaded to do it. I say this because you say that this couple was strangers to you, but not to your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  You are right to feel your personal space was violated by these people. However you're not right to paint all people with open relationships as "disgusting". Their relationship style may not work for you, but it works for them.<br>  <br>  Again though, these instances were not real swingers. Real swingers are much, much more discrete and don't try to "convert" non-swingers because it just doesn't work and they wouldn't waste their time doing so.<br>  <br>  As far as these other people -- take them off guard by telling them that you are flattered that they think you are attractive but that you aren't interested in what they are proposing and you'd appreciate it if they don't bring it up again.
AA11412999	That's like asking, "Do parents who drink alcohol make bad parents?"  It depends entirely on whether or not the parents are simply dedicated oenophiles who have developed a taste for fine wine and who drink in moderation, or a pair of raging alcoholics whose thirst for alcohol ranges from fine brandy right on down to cough syrup and mouthwash because, lets face it, when you're that far into the pit, just about anything will do if all you're trying to do is keep your buzz to avoid sobriety.<br>  <br>  While I know there are some responsible swingers  who are quite open about their lifestyle, I believe the ones I know have families who are nearly or fully grown.  Their kids were brought up in an atmosphere of maturity about sexuality, and it is viewed as healthy, yet a great responsibility.  Do they have people over while their kids are in the house?  I should hope not, because things that go on behind Mommy and Daddy's bedroom door are not their concern, and kids shouldn't be confronted with such things.<br>  <br>  There's something to be said for discretion.  It's not the same as hiding out of shame; it's discretion for the sake of protecting others' feelings.  Not everyone is ready to deal with this kind of affront to their sensibilities, and most don't even want to.  So it's just polite to keep ourselves to ourselves.<br>  <br>  Kids and swinging don't mix.  Swinging deals primarily with sex for sex's sake, and it's about as easy to explain to a kid who walks in on it as trying to explain why Mommy is brushing her teeth with Daddy's penis.  To the adults, one is no worse than the other, but both are pretty scary to a kid.  If it's a matter of polyamory, where long-term meaningful relationships are formed and "Aunt Kate" will be coming to live with us, then of course the impact on kids must be weighed VERY carefully before making any big decisions.  It's been known to work, but it would be very complex and fraught with pitfalls.  |`|6sns33traa	Can a couple that has oral sex raise children?<br>  <br>  Can a couple that has anal sex raise children?<br>  <br>  Can a couple that uses sex toys raise children?<br>  <br>  Can a couple that likes bondage or paddles in their sex play raise children?<br>  <br>  My point is that sex within a couple is none of their kids business, regardless of how they have sex, when they have sex and if the decided to include others in their sex (which is really just another way to have sex).<br>  <br>  My wife and I have had a sexually open relationship for years, and we also have three healthy, very well adjusted children ranging in age from high school to elementary school.  Our sex life is private and we don't share any part of it with our kids. Period.<br>  <br>  To paint swingers and others with open relationships with such a broad brush is just plain wrong.<br>  <br>  As far as your brother and sister-in-law, it sounds like they have many more problems than just sex.  If what you say is true they aren't fit parents regardless of their sex life, not because of their sex life.|`|ZTKHwuM2aa	I am a strong believer that family comes first. I agree that they should not be neglecting the children for selfish reasons. I think you should try to speak to your brother about a very valid concerns. Social Services in my experience being a social worker can be equally damaging to the children and their living conditions will not be improving at all by taking this measure again it mostly affects the children not only by bringing more separation and bringing them to once again hop from stranger to stranger. The parental skills of your brother and his wife it's what is alarming not their sexual practices.<br>  People can have fun in the bedroom and yet have their priorities in place and they seem not to be able to balance the two.<br>  Try to talk to him and intervene as a alternative your niece and nephews can stay with you? perhaps? this way, you can ask them to  get their sh*t together.<br>  Talk about the children not their sex life since it can feel as a personal attack to them and I'm sure your concerns are around the children not them <br>  hope this helped.|`|07kMcIeSaa	no, they don't always make bad parents. i don't agree with the "swinger" lifestyle, but i will say that many swingers are discrete about what they do and somehow able to maintain a good relationship with their partner, most don't let it influence other parts of their lives. the danger comes when they are letting it influence their behavior on such a large level that they are being forced to up root their children on a regular basis and are being neglected, as seems to be the case with your brother and sister in law. their behavior is definitely bad for the children, but that is not the case with all swingers|`|ZuipHl3Eaa	Hiya!!!<br>  <br>  I think if any parent has a conversation with their children about what happens in their bedroom, they are lacking some serious judgment.
