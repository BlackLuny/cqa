8kwiMnVQaa	Are you wanting size as in molecular weight or physical radius?  <br>  <br>  Cl has a larger molecular weight and is a heavier molecule.  <br>  However, Cl has a smaller radius than Na.  They are both in the same row of the periodic table, but since Cl has more electrons and protons, the electrons are more attracted to the center and pulled in.  Na has fewer e- and p+, allowing the orbitals to more freely spread out.<br>  <br>  Answer:  Na is physically larger.|`|q3SRQN6zaa	Na, they are both in the same row, but as you progress further to the right in the row the radius of the atom shrinks because the electrons are held more tightly together.<br>  <br>  Maverick J - You're forgetting about the effective nuclear charge.  Both Na and Cl are in the same row so the electrons are in the same orbital, but as you go to the right of the periodic table you are increasing the number of protons (positive charge) in the nucleus and so the increased number of electrons will be attracted more strongly and will actually be pulled in closer, reducing the size of the radius.<br>  <br>  Na has a radius of 1.86 Angstroms<br>  Cl has a radius of 1.80 Angstroms|`|wSzBHx0Raa	Cl|`|gwM3ZXuEaa	Cl has valence electrons going out the farthest (it has 7 Na only has 1) and is therefore the largest atom.<br>  <br>  1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^5 is the electron configuration of Cl to prove it

RrvJ99uaaa	The Rational Roots (or Rational Zeroes) Test is a handy way of obtaining a list of useful first guesses when you are trying to find the zeroes (roots) of a polynomial. Given a polynomial with integer (that is, positive and negative "whole-number") coefficients, the possible (or potential) zeroes are found by listing the factors of the constant (last) term over the factors of the leading coefficient, thus forming a list of fractions. This listing gives you a list of potential rational (fractional) roots to test -- hence the name of the Test.<br>  ----<br>  <br>  Take the factors of 15 which are 1, 3, 5, 15, and place them in numerators of fractions having the factors of 3 as the denominator. The factors of 3 are 1 and 3.<br>  <br>  That yields: +/-  1/1,  +/-  1/3;  +/-  3/1,  +/-  3/3;  +/- 5/1,       +/- 5/3; +/- 15/1,  +/- 15/3<br>  <br>  Cull out duplicates (if any) after simplifying: 1, -1, 1/3, -1/3, <br>  3, -3, 5, -5, 5/3, -5/3, 15,  and -15 .

ayB4KsTraa	The general trend is that at lower temperatures, the density of a substance increases as the molecules are more closely packed together. However, along with the other intermolecular forces, water can make hydrogen bonds between its molecules. <br>  <br>  These are very strong (about 10% the strength of a normal covalent bond). The O-H bond in water is polar because the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen one. Thus the electron density around the hydrogen is lower, effectively leaving a 'naked nucleus' which in this case is just one single proton. This has a positive charge and so is attracted to the electrons of other oxygen atoms of neighbouring molecules. This is the formation of a hydrogen bond.<br>  <br>  In its liquid state, water forms approximately 3.4 hydrogen bonds with the molecules around it but in ice, the molecules align themselves to form more, increasing this number to 4. As such, an open hexagonal structure is formed which takes up more space, thus the density is lower.|`|CIqcbuh8aa	it's just a property of water as a solid that it is less dense, is there really another answer for that?|`|He5XWnJtaa	Water acts in an unusual matter because the crystaline structure most commonly found in its solid form under natural conditions has a less dense, more loosely packed structure than its liquid form. <br>  <br>  Under different conditions, water can form at least 17 different kinds of solid crystalline structures, some of which are denser than its liquid form.

yV1jZkqGaa	heyy :) i'm not too sure about the following, but this is what i think they are. also i have backed up a few with a bit of extra research :)<br>  <br>  Simple frequency --<br>  Im pretty sure thats just normal frequency. i.e. how much something occured in a set time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Relative Frequency --<br>  Compares each class interval to the total number. e.g. if you asked 32 people how much TV they watch, and 8 people said 2 hours per day. The frequency would be 8, and the total number was 32. Therefore the relative frequency would be 8/32.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cumulative Frequency --<br>  Is the addition of each frequency to the last. e.g. (using the example from above) the first class frequency is 8. If 10 people were in the next class frequency and said they watched 3 hours of tv per day, the cumulative frequency at that moment would be 18 (10+ 8). If 4 people watched 4 hours of tv, then the cumulative frequency would be 18+4, i.e. 22. {It sounds confusing but its not, you bascally just keep a running total of the frequencies.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Percentile --<br>  I'm not sure about this one. I would have thought it was the percentage each class frequency represents. e.g. 8/32 = 25%<br>   But this website says differently<br>  <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=4904" rel="nofollow">http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.as...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry if i just confused you more.. that has happened before..<br>  <br>  Hope I could help in some way :)

GASTNilgaa	I'm going to write sqrt(blah) for the square root of blah.  I'm assuming the function there is a fraction whose numerator is<br>  <br>  1 - sqrt(1 - x^2)<br>  <br>  and whose denominator is x.<br>  <br>  The trick is to multiply numerator and denominator both by the function <br>  <br>  1 + sqrt(1-x^2).<br>  <br>  When you do this on top, you get<br>  <br>  (1-sqrt(1-x^2)) (1 + sqrt(1-x^2)) = 1 - sqrt(1-x^2)^2 = 1 - (1-x^2) = x^2<br>  since the terms involving the square root all by itself cancel when you expand out the product.<br>  <br>  When you do this on the bottom you get<br>  <br>  x (1 + sqrt(1-x^2)), which.. well, just is what is.<br>  <br>  Multiplying top and bottom by the same thing doesn't change the fraction, so<br>  <br>  (1 - sqrt(1-x^2))/x = x^2/(x (1 + sqrt(1-x^2))<br>  <br>  The point is that there is some cancellation that takes place here: we can pull an x out of both top and bottom, getting<br>  <br>  (1 - sqrt(1-x^2))/x = x/(1 + sqrt(1-x^2))<br>  <br>  As x goes to 0, you can evaluate the limit just by "plugging in" here, because the right hand side of the above is continuous at 0.  You get a limit of 0 in the numerator, 1 + sqrt(1 - 0) = 2 in the denominator, giving a limit of 0/2 = 0 for the quotient.

This one can easily be solved via substitution, so I will do that. You could also solve it via elimination. In order to get the value to substitute into the equations, we need to simplify equation #2. In doing this we need to try to keep either x or y by itself on one side of the equation.<br>  <br>  3y+2x=5y-2x <br>  Subtract 5y from both sides.<br>  <br>  -2y + 2x = -2x<br>  Subtract 2x from both sides.<br>  <br>  -2y = -4x<br>  Divide both sides by -2<br>  <br>  y = 2x<br>  <br>  By doing this, we ended up solving for y.

GASTNilgaa	You can't say that the integral is (sin x)^8/8 + C.  Why not?  It has to do with the chain rule.  The power rule says that if<br>  <br>  f(x) = x^8<br>  then f'(x) = 8 x^7.<br>  <br>  If you have some general function g(x) and you want the derivative of g(x)^8, you have to use the chain rule.  The derivative of<br>  <br>  f(g(x)) is f'(g(x)) g'(x) or 8 (g(x))^7 g'(x).<br>  <br>  In particular, the derivative of (sin x)^8/8 is <br>  <br>  (1/8) * 8 (sin x)^7 * (cos x) = (sin x)^7 cos x, not (sin x)^7.<br>  <br>  This is why the integral of (sin x)^7 cannot be (sin x)^8/8 + C.<br>  <br>  In general, the integral of f(x)^p, where p is some power, is not [f(x)^{p+1}]/(p+1), for much the same reason.  When you take the derivative of this you get not f(x)^p but f(x)^p f'(x) in general.<br>  <br>  So how do you take the integral?  I'd write<br>  <br>  (sin x)^7 = (sin x) (sin x)^6 = (sin x) ((sin x)^2)^3<br>  = (sin x)(1 - (cos x)^2)^3<br>  <br>  and make the substitution u = cos x.  Then du = - sin x dx so that dx = -1/(sin x) du, so that <br>  <br>  integral of (sin x)^7 dx = -integral (1 - u^2)^3 du<br>  <br>  You can take the u-integral by expanding it out and using the power rule on each piece.  (You can use the power rule to integrate powers of u with respect to u.)<br>  <br>  Integrating odd powers of cosine would be done the same way.  you "peel off" one cosine, write the rest (which is a function of cos^2) as a function of sin^2, then let u = sin.  The cosine you "peeled off" gets absorbed in the du and you can use the power rule on what's left.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

Firstly, I would suggest drawing a picture to help you better visualize the problem. Recall the pythagorean theorem now, a^2+b^2=c^2, where c is the hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal in this case). Now simply plug in the numbers. 16^2+b^2=20^2. Punch this out on a calculator if you want to save some time. So the resulting equation should look like this if you want to punch it out in one line: [Square root](20^2-16^2) = b. Punch this out and you will get the height of the monitor in inches. (Answer is 12in)<br>  <br>  If you are familiar with pythagorean triples, basically easy ways to complete triangles, you will notice that this specific triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle.

And there's your answer.<br>  <br>  If the numbers are mixed (as in 1 2/3) Then convert it to an improper fraction, which would be 5/3. How did I do that? Multiply 1 x 3. And add by two.

You should get x^2 = 50x + 5,000. Set it equal to zero and you will have x^2 - 50x - 5,000 = 0. Now you have to do the quadratic formula and you should get two answers: 100 and -50.  If you sub them into the original equation they both work so x = 100 and -50.<br>  <br>  For the second one you need to find the least common denominator which would be (2x + 7)(x + 3) and multiply that by both sides.  When you multiply is by the first fraction on the left the (2x + 7) cancels and you get x(x + 3) which is x^2 + 3x.  When you multiply the LCD by the second fraction on the left the (x + 3) cancels and you have <br>  (2x + 7)(x + 1) which is 2x^2 + 9x + 7.  Since you're subtracting the whole quantity of (2x^2 + 9x + 7) you need to change the signs so x^2 + 3x - 2x^2 - 9x - 7 = -x^2 - 6x - 7 = 1 (2x + 7)(x + 3). Multiply this side through and you get 2x^2 + 13x +21.  Set it equal to zero.  I moved the negative x so i could deal with positive numbers so now you have 3x^2 + 19x + 28 = 0.  Do the quadratic formula and you get two answers again: -2.3 repeating which could also be written as- 2 1/3 and -4. When you sub them into the original equation once again they both work so your answer is x = -2 1/3 and -4.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped and sorry so long...

Many from out side of that region want to keep the area pristine and the way it was 100 years ago.  What is not taken into consideration is that people live there, they are part of the world like all the other animals. Cutting forest for logging and then grazing of cattle is part of living.  When forests are burned for grazing, that is fine, the problem is that they do not add fertilizer and maintain the area, they only graze for 2-4 years then move on, and burn another area.  That is one type of mismanagement.  They could replant trees but don't in the area they are leaving. You have to remember the US was for the most part untouched and it was "exploited" for homes, logging and minerals ect.  To deny that to another country would be wrong.  Instead of trying to slow changes in the forest, which doesn't work, it should be managed with areas set aside for parks, strict enforcement of non logging areas, no road building in those areas.      I guess to answer your question, I would say, it is not being exploited only mismanaged in some areas for the long term value it delivers
FEdsZs2oaa	The major contribution the climate makes to the Amazon is the vast amount of precipitation, humidity, and warmth.  Although it rains year-round, the Amazon has a "rainy" season.  A vast majority of the precipitation falls during this period and it is enough to raise the levels of many rivers, flooding nearby forests and villages.  The climate in the Amazon is consistent with daytime temperatures ranging from the mid to upper 80s and falling to the low 70s in the night. Rain falls approximately 250 days of the year. While many areas have distinct rainy and dry seasons, others do not. Even the high water level is not necessarily dependent on rainfall during the rainy season, but on other factors such as the rate of evaporation and transpiration of plants. There are about 100 inches (250 centimeters) of rainfall per year in the Amazon with the forest creating about half of its own rainfall. This intricate water cycle has helped to create the diversity of life found in the Amazon basin and has sustained its existence for millions of years. It remains to be seen what devastating impact the human intervention of deforestation will have on this cycle.  http://library.thinkquest.org/21395/text...|`|6qsTmMQaaa	There is about 100 inches of rainfall per year in the Amazon rainforest

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	First of all, you need to look at the laws in the state(s) you'll be seeking a license in, as they vary from state to state.     Once you determine the requirements, set yourself up a long term plan that will give you time to prepare for the PE exam.  Some of the exam will be of an academic nature, and you've been away from that for a while, so you'll need to get some practice in.  The licensing board in your state will most likely have a list of what is covered.    Also, look into purchasing study material, there is a wealth of it available that is really good quality.  And check around at your new company to see if anyone has recently (in the last 5 years) taken the exam, they will be able to point you in the right direction, as well as maybe being able to loan you some of their study materials.    Good luck!    EDIT:  as for Retired's comments - you can check into getting out of the exam, but I think most places have phased that out route to a PE.  Which is good in some ways (more strict guidelines leading to better quality professionals), but terrible in others (a very experienced engineer like yourself has to jump through the hoops).|`|V8jIAEmBaa	First, look at the requirements in your state or commonwealth, especially for licensure by endorsement and licensure by examination. http://www.ncees.org/licensure/licensing... While you are there, poke around the NCEES site, they are they guys that make the tests, lots of general info there.    In general, you take an 8 hour test, used to be called the Engineer in Training, now called FE  (Fundamentals of Engineering). There are some exemptions, based on experience, be sure to check state laws to see if you don't have to take. I was forced to, even with 15 years experience. 4 hr test is on general engineering, 4 hrs in your selected specialty. On the NCEES website, look at the very limited list of calculators now allowed by ncees on the test. You should do your practice on the planned calculator. I am very impressed by the Casio fx115ES (smart display) calc.    Then, 4 years of experience required. Some states no longer allow credit for time worked prior to taking the FE. Once you qualify and get references, then take PE, another 8 hr test in your selected specialty.    Here's a general reference:  http://www.pspe.org/pdfs/reporter06_Mar_...    For the FE, you need to get and study a copy of the  NCEES Fundamentals of Engineering Supplied-Reference Handbook - Reivsed (NCEES8R), 8th Edition),   http://www.ppi2pass.com/ppi/PPIShop  and a review book. I highly recommend Lindeburg, FE Review Manual (FERM2), 2nd Edition. You can also consider getting some worked examples books if you need more practice.    Some states have general FE and/or PE test, some have specialty specific ones. Make sure you know what your state requires before you get your study guide for the PE test (Principles and Practices Examination).     Good luck!|`|G5QC5f5baa	At one time, in some states, an engineer with many years of experience could get a PE without taking the exams. That alternative is probably no longer available, but you should check.    To prepare for the exams, take refresher courses. The courses will make you familiar with the types of questions to expect. Make sure that you have good reference books or texts that cover what you need to know and make sure you can find things quickly in the books.|`|oXPDFw4daa	Did you take the Fundamentals of Engineering exam at the time you completed your degree?  If so, the challenge you are facing is not insurmountable.  You will need to take the Principles of Engineering exam, but since there are different exams for different disciplines, it probably won't be that much of a challenge since it will test the things that engineers in your field do on a regular basis.    But if you didn't take the FE exam, you have a bigger hurdle.  That exam covers all of the topics you studied in school but have forgotten since then.  Many universities offer refresher courses that will help you get past that exam.    By the way, for the record, I always recommend that people take the PE exam as soon as possible in their career - even if their current job doesn't require a PE.  One reason is that it's easier when you are younger (us old guys tend to forget the stuff we don't use every day).  The other is that it looks good on the resume and may make a difference in getting a job in the future.

There exists two types of friction:  static and dynamic.  They are not exactly the same (they almost always have different value).    The rule is:  when one body is at rest with the support surface (e.g., a box on top of a carpet), you must use the static friction to find out how much minimum force you must apply in order to get the moving moving.  In order to do that, you use the weight of the box, the contact area and the coefficient of STATIC friction.  This will give you a force.  As long as the push is less than that static friction force, the box ain't going nowhere.    Once the box is moving, the friction is calculated using the dynamic coefficient of friction (which may depend on speed -- but it never does for the first homework problems).  This also gives a force.  The acceleration of the box will depend on the total force applied, minus the dynamic friction force.    Or, as it is used in practice, the force needed to keep the box moving at a steady speed is the same as the dynamic friction force.    For almost all types of material (including cardboard on carpet, for example) the dynamic coefficient is almost always less than the static coefficient.  This is why there is often a little "jolt" of acceleration when the box finally gets moving (the resisting force has a sudden drop when it goes from static to dynamic friction).    The difference is due to weak polarity bonds between the "cardboard molecules" and the "carpet molecules" which has time to get themselves set up when the box is stopped but not if the object is moving.  (You can picture it as: the molecules will get a better fit between themselves if the box is stopped rather than when it is moving)    As with everything in real life, it is possible to get a speed so low that the polarity bond does have time to set itself every time one molecule passes over another.    This minimum speed changes from object to object (e.g., box-on-carpet will have a different minimum speed than skate-on-ice).    Therefore, it is possible to have a box moving soooo slowly that one must use static friction in the calculation.  However, this is known as an unstable equilibrium:  as soon as the equilibrium is broken (whatever the cause, for example a drop of butter on the carpet at just the wrong place), the friction goes to dynamic mode and the box immediately accelerates beyond the threshold (because of the "jolt" when the mode changes).    But in theory, the "moving static friction" could exist.    In mechanical physics, such a box would be moving so slowly that it would be considered stopped... even though its position would change with time.    Similar ideas exists in other branches of physics (look up "entaglement" in particle physics) but they are not quite the same.|`|YOqbGO2Maa	A million years to travel 1" is hyper-fast compared with the minimum speed.    An object must move at least it's own wavelength in the lifetime of the universe to be considered to be "in motion".    A marble has a mass (for example) of 0.004 kg, and a wavelength of 5.5 x 10^-30 m.  The minimum speed would be 1.3 x 10^-47 m/s.    One inch in a million years is 8 x 10^-16 m/s, about 6 x 10^31 times faster.|`|AA11447210	Nope...moving is moving, no matter how slowly.

HTmj2BXDaa	I am not an EE and certainly not what I would call an expert in control systems but, in principle, anything that can be measured can be used as the basis for control logic.  In this specific example, you simply need to record the light intensity at a given poiint in time or over a given time interval (could be milliseconds to hours depending on your application and the technology used).  Then measure the same parameter at another point in time.  Then have the logic compare the two, examples:  If  2 is less than some fraction of  1, run process A.  If  2 =  1 +/- some tolerance, run process B.     The tough part is defining very specifically what the control characteristics are.  You need to account for the sensitivity of sensors, the variation in the environment, the response time of your control system, etc.    So answer is yes, anything is possible, it is only a matter of time and money (and some things take more time and more money than you have)   Good luck|`|acbqsZZbaa	The short answer is yes.    Find yourself a light sensor circuit using a photodiode or light dependant resistor, take the output of that circuit and put it through a differentiator circuit. That can be as simple as a capacitor and a resistor, or it could be based on an op-amp (google op-amp differentiator).|`|qaMPEdL2aa	Well it is all in how you process the sensor signal.  Just use the signal proportional to intensity and take its time derivative.
JMJsCU1vaa	they are supposed to notify you if they find anything before the final results are given if they are positive...The drugs you mentioned are both processed out of your system within 72 hours... they don't detect traces, you actually have to have so many parts per billion/million for them to even show positive, for instance they have a 50 ppm limit on cannabis, but if you had a reading of say 45ppm, it would be reported as negative, even though there was a trace per say.  here is some more stats on the subject....good luck in the future, and screw the piss police.  The worst one you can do is Pot, as it remains detectable the longest of all   Most all narcotics and cocaine and amphetamines have about a 72 hour window of detect ability, making them pretty safe, in that you could do them Friday night, and be clean by Monday   Some exceptions are drugs that fall into the category of Benzodiazepines,  these are valium, colonopin, ruhpynol, they can remain detectable for 9-14 days     A good way to prepare for a drug test is to first abstain from consuming any more drugs, flush your system with cranberry juice, the more the better this could cause your urine to appear very clear, this could arouse suspicion, so get yourself some B Complex vitamins, but only take ? or ? of a pill the morning before the test, as this will turn your urine yellow immediatelyIf you take a whole one, it can actually make your urine so yellow Ive seen it damn near look fluorescent, and thats not good either  The whole idea is for it to appear normal and be clean  With a job test, you could use a clean urine of someone else, but you must use a container that holds enough of a sample and it must be of body temperatureTo do this, take a squirt bottle such as an Elmers glue bottle and empty it and clean it out completely place the urine sample in the bottle and  loosely place the top on and place in a microwave oven, give it 15 seconds  to heat it up make sure you do this at least an hour before you need to give the sample as you want it body temperature at the time you give the sample,   place the bottle with tape or something to hold it in place right under your nuts  and or the crease of your leg in your crotch The idea is it can cool down to your body temperature, instead of trying to heat a cold specimen up to body  temperature Then when you go into the bathroom, be very careful and empty the  urine into the specimen cup, being very careful to not drop the cap , hence why I suggested something with a twist/squirt top They carefully listen for sounds that indicate you may be doing something to defeat their test Only give just enough  to reach the line they ask for    Of course that was for using a substitute specimen Now if you want to use your own, which I always do, you follow the instructions above about flushing your system and abstaining, and then the day of the test you must be careful to do it this way; Never give the first urine of the day as your test sample, this contains the heaviest concentration of impurities and should never be used, second, when you go  to give the  sample, start your stream of urine in the toilet, then in mid stream fill the specimen cup only to the level they ask for, then finish in the toiletDO NOT FLUSH the toilet, they will either flush it for you or tell you when to flush it The reason you use mid stream is that the beginning of your stream contains the most impurities and the end contains a higher percentage than mid stream So all you have to do is be under the level that they determine to be positive and your clean They DO NOT say they detected a trace amount, youre either Negative or Positivethe only other conclusion possible is Inconclusive, or adultered, of which you dont want either of those Inconclusive happens to people who flush their system so bad without replacing color and electrolytes , indicating suspicion, or some people actually try to add something directly to the sample such as salt, and that will get you an  adultered result, which is as bad as positive    If your young and have a high metabolism and are an occasional user, you can clean yourself out pretty easily and take the test using your own urine with little fear  One way to know in advance is to get a friends company on company letterhead type up a letter saying you are to get a drug test, go to a drug testing facility somewhere away from the one your going to be sent to and pay for a get a test yourself.. That way youll know for sure if you have any doubt, remember to have the letter state that the results may be released to you to bring back to them This is extreme, but once I felt the need to do this to be sure, and it was worth the extra money to know I was cleanof course this was a probationary test, where if I would have failed, I would have gone to jail, so it was especially critical for me to be clean  Also I might add that if your being tested as a condition of probation  they will

4c2daec05f4f88483fd1490ee194945aaa	It's hard to measure intelligence by accomplishments, since accomplishments depend so much on motivation, what they have to work with, the luck to come up with a specific great idea, and the diligence and means to pursue it.  Genius is an arbitrary point on the bell-curve of the statistical distribution of intelligence, around IQ 150, or about the top 1/10 of 1% of the population.    Many factors are increasing the average intelligence of the human population, by an average of around 3 IQ points per decade (the Flynn effect).  For the sake of argument, let's say Einstein had an IQ of 150 when he won his 1921 Nobel Prize in physics.  If you could magically bring that person today and test his IQ, it would range between 150 and 135, depending on if and how you compensated for the Flynn effect.    Physicists today have much more complexity to deal with than Einstein did.  Feynman is a good candidate among well-known scientists, but there are many today doing much more intellectually demanding work in physics.  But the great breakthroughs are much harder to come by, so they don't reach as much public notice.  Modern mental giants who have received some public notice include Alan Guth, Stephen Hawking, Lisa Randall and others.|`|SiOjEH00aa	personally, i think i'm more of a genius.|`|lhYIk8b2aa	Feynman  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Fey...

DX0Jt79Waa	The speed of light can be measured.  There are measuring devices, but they require some expertise and high technology and are way beyond amature physics.  <br>  <br>  Back in the late 19th Century, early 20th century, it was observed that the speed of light was the same whether it was coming from one part of the sky or from another part of the sky.  The speed of the Earth traveling through space seemed not to make light "speed up" when it was in the oncoming direction relative to Earth, nor did light appear to slow down if the source was in the direction opposite to the direction Earth was traveling.  Einstein proposed, as a founding principle to Special Relativity, that the speed of light was the same in all directions and was therefor the same for any observer traveling at any speed relative to the source of the light, any "inertial reference frame".  This "idea" led to Special Relativity, which predicts the time dilation effect of one observer relative to another observer traveling at a different speed.  <br>  <br>  Think about this:  the important laws of physics represented by Maxwell's equations depend on the speed of light - the speed of light appears in the equations.  If the speed of light were not everywhere constant, then the laws of physics would change from one reference frame to another.   There would also have to be one special reference frame "at rest".  There does not seem to be any "special" at rest reference frame, and the laws of physics to not change from one inertial reference frame to another.|`|Ctq3pcIsaa	dont go looking into things. it is because god made it that way|`|GIH9JB04aa	That's just the way it is!|`|O8qyhAegaa	It comes from the constants of our finely tuned universe. <br>  It's magnitude is given by the square root of the the value given by the ratio of the electrical force constant (8.98755 x 10^9 N-m^2/c^2) to the magnetic force constant (10^-7 N/A^2).

Some have speculated that these may change in very small amounts over great time periods, but there is no evidence of this phenomenon so far.

AA11146651	Ok, this is where attention to detail comes into play.  At first glance, one might think the decimal is simply .25.  However, .25 is the equivalent of 25% (25 divided by 100 = .25).  The problem is asking about 1/4%.  <br>  <br>  So first convert 1/4% to a true decimal by dividing .25 by 100 to get .0025.<br>  <br>  Now, to convert to a fraction, you have to determine the numerator, then determine the denominator.  Both are easy.  The numerator is determined by ignoring the decimal point and leading zeros of your decimal.  So, the numerator of your fraction is going to be 25. <br>  <br>  The denominator is going to be a number like 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc.  To determine which number it is, count the number of places to the right of the decimal to come up with the number of zeros you are going to have.<br>  <br>  With .0025, there are four places to the right of the decimal.  So, your denominator is going to be 10,000 (get it?  four places to the right of the decimal = four zeros in the denominator).<br>  <br>  So your fraction is 25/10,000<br>  <br>  Reduce that down to the lowest common denominator and you end up with 1/400.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

AA11146651	First, figure out the first part of the question.  You know the sum of 7 numbers = 980.  And you know it's 7 numbers in a row.  So, you can come up with an equation and solve it, like this:<br>  A+(A+1)+(A+2)+(A+3)+(A+4)+(A+5)+(A+6)=...<br>  7A + 21 = 980<br>  7A = 959<br>  A = 137<br>  <br>  So, your 7 integers are 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, and 143.  You can prove this by adding them together to get 980.  <br>  <br>  Now you determine which of these numbers are prime.  The easiest way is to look at a prime table which shows that 137 and 139 are the prime numbers.

This energy will be transmitted to the snow if its a nice sunny day. the snow can definately melt due to the suns radiation energy. (the same effect occurs but opposite when there is a layer of frost on the ground but it never got below freezing) its a complicated thermodynamics problem, but yes it can|`|q6phm94caa	Sunshine on a clear day can deliver up to a kilowatt of solar heat per square meter (this equates to 3600 kJ of heat every hour).   A good layering of snow may have a density of a kilogram per square meter, and the heat necessary to melt a kilogram of snow is about 360 kJ. This is ten time less than the suns heat, so why doesn't the snow melt?  The main reason is that, being white, the snow reflects most of the suns heat back up to the sky.   The second reason is that not many places on earth have snow when the sun is high in the sky, and the suns heat is reduced in proportion to its angle from the perpendicular.   A third reason is that snow and ice are good insulators and when the surface layer of snow melts in the sun it seeps into the snow below it and refreezes. This forms a crisp layer of frozen snow insulating the dry snow underneath.|`|KfBWOvf3aa	no. in normal atmosphere pressure, the ice will not melt if the temperature is below 0 C. it happens once in 6 months on both poles actually. because the earth's rotation axis is inclined 23,5 degree with respect to its revolution plane, then every six months, the sun always appears in one of the pole's sky. (when the sun always appears on north pole sky for example, it never appears on south pole's sky.) however, the ice on pole never melt because of this. to make the ice melt, you must increase the temperature above freezing point. if sunshine can do that, fine. if sunshine can't do that, then the snow won't melt, no matter how strong it is|`|ytNlz3b7aa	The only thing that affects whether the snow melts or not is the air temperature.|`|vR0FRRtoaa	I think it will.. it has been snowing here today but the sun is out now and the snow is turning to slush :(|`|FnDU2fhxaa	same here. but it might snow tonight again :)|`|Y25qW2SOaa	The sun is responsible for any kind of heating in the atmosphere around you. if it is still freezing, that means sun is not shining hard enough to make the surroundings warm. so the snow would not melt.

CCeRdaoLaa	It depends on what selective forces are in play between now and then.  This is also assuming that we don't die out before then.  Our sun will still be going strong, but there's a wide assortment of catastrophic events that could still wipe us out.    If civilization collapses and we return to the dark ages, then physical fitness and the ability to get by with little food will be essential to survival, and we might end up shorter and stockier.  The same would be true if global warming triggered another ice age.    If we leave the planet in space stations and starships, we might acclimate to low gravity and suffer fewer ill effects from it.  We also wouldn't need the same build we have today, so we might slowly evolve leaner frames with thinner limbs.    If we continue to pollute the earth until it becomes a radioactive wasteland, then we may build up a resistance to toxins and radiation in the environment.    If we stay where we are right now, then there will be very few selective factors in our lives.  So long as basic survival is taken care of, many of our traits could atrophy away.  Hair, nails, eyesight, and physical fitness could all degenerate, so long as we maintained the bare minimum to function given medicine and technology.    It all depends on what the future holds for us.  Even then, it's still speculation.  Evolution is powered by gene assortment and random mutation, and given shape by selection - we can make some educated guesses, but there's still no way to predict the future.|`|aIakDSstaa	I think we will look like the greys    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greys|`|FxvZmBGBaa	the same probably   but a lot taller!

mH1Tnv5Naa	Yes, in that air is normally warmed by heat coming from the ground.  Snow is a relatively good insulator, and when it covers the ground it shields the air from the warmer ground and allows the air to cool more or warm less than it would otherwise, especially if the sky is clear.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Yes. Snow doesn't need to melt, but it can sublime due to the appreciable vapour pressure of water. This is an endothermic process, drawing in heat from the air, making the air a lot colder.    A pile of snow can gradually disappear on a dry day, even if the temperature does not go above 0C, meaning the snow will not melt. If it disappears, it must have sublimed instead.|`|q19XQEquaa	yes..coz snow has more heat taking capacity.than water

Specifically:    1 KWh = 3.6 * 10^6 J    This is an exact value.|`|aSc1XHDXaa	Let's look at the term...  and break it down to SI units  kilowatt-hour  = kWh  kilowatt = 1000W = 1000 joules/second  Hour = 60minutes = 3600seconds.    So kWh = 1000 joules/second * 3600 seconds  .. = 3 600 000 Joules    Now Joules is a measure of ENERGY..    So kilowatt-hour is layman's word used to measure an amount of ENERGY.

Greater variance means greater uncertainty in your data points.<br>  <br>  If you mean, identify the possible sources of the uncertainties, then consider:<br>  <br>  1.

WkWedRnoaa	A light year is distance and does not correlate directly with actual years, which are time. <br>  <br>  Light from an object that we see at a distance of 4 light years left the object about four years ago.  But light from objects that are billions of light years away is affected by the expansion of space (the universe is getting bigger) and by everything the light passes on its journey to us.  <br>  <br>  As light leaves an object, it's photons travel in "straight" lines that are affected by matter and gravity.  Matter such as solid objects (stars, planets, etc) can block the light, just as you do when you "see" anything, here on Earth or from space.  The gravity produced by the matter, planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, can bend the path that the light takes.<br>  <br>  Light from an object that is far away at the time it is generated can travel billions of light years, which at the speed of light, corresponds to billions of years.  BUT, while the light is travelling, the universe is expanding and the light gets "stretched" out along the way (red shift).<br>  Though light never exceeds the "speed of light", the distance that the light has travelled is determined by the amount of "stretching" (red shift) that it has undergone.  When we finally see the light, we note its red shift and from that determine that the object is NOW 12.2 billion light years away from us.  If the universe were not expanding, we could say that since the object is 12.2 billion light years away from us, it's light left 12.2 billion years ago, since it takes light one year to travel one light year.  BUT the universe IS expanding, which allows light to look like it's travelling faster than the speed of light and thus, the object IS at 12.2 billion light years but it took less than 12.2 billion years for the light to reach us, so we are looking back in time to a point less than 12.2 billion years ago.  I don't know the math, but it is theorectically possible to see light from objects at distances greater than 14 billion light years, even though the universe was created in the Big Bang only 13.7 billion years ago.|`|0i80jUKeaa	If we see the light from an explosion 12.2 billion light years away, that means it occurred 12.2 billion years ago.

Near a black hole event horizon, the pair can pop into existence and one partner will get sucked into the black hole and the other one will escape by quantum tunneling to the outside of the event horizon.  Only near a black hole event horizon can that happen.    So black holes do lose mass over time due to radiating energy in the form of Hawking's radiation.  Eventually the black hole will "evaporate" completely.|`|GIH9JB04aa	Hawking radiation, EM radiation(radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultra violet, x-rays and gamma rays), all kinds of particles when they evaporate!|`|cervQlVzaa	X-Rays.|`|qSwGwO5Kaa	I think it is the gamma ray that emitting from the black hole.|`|O8qyhAegaa	You are thinking of Bekenstein-Hawking radiation=<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_rad...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjzjZyRd07Q&feature=PlayList&p=BAB6DF0A2C80A4DA&index=28" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjzjZyRd0...</a>|`|aNlT1NRqaa	It's been named Hawking Radiation. Basically no net matter can be created, only converted from something else. Stephen Hawking showed that in the turbulence around a black hole a particle and its anti-particle would spontaneously be created (no net gain = 0), but sometimes the anti-particle would be recaptured and the particle would escape. This would give the black hole a negative mass gain & release the particle as radiation that, theoretically, could be spotted & measured.<br>  <br>  One of the experiments planned @ CERN is to create these particles. As there won't be a black hole to swallow the particles, they will just self destruct as unstable or if they re-collide with each other.<br>  <br>  Light is a form of radiation, but the radio waves that allow you to listen to music are invisible to your eyes. The radiation from a black hole is invisible to our eyes & needs special equipment to be seen. Also "all mass gives off some form of light" is wrong. Asteroids don't give off radiation (usually), but they doo reflect light. Black holes create radiation, but they reflect nothing.

Ftkr9jqYaa	A savanna or savannah is a tropical, subtropical or (in broader sense) temperate woodland ecosystem characterised by the trees being sufficiently small or widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of C4 grasses.<br>  <br>  There are many savanna biomes, including grassland savanna, from which trees are absent.  Other classifications include:<br>  <br>  (1) Tropical and subtropical savanna, grasslands and shrublands are biomes exemplified by the savannas of Africa, including the Serengeti, famous for its wildlife.<br>   <br>  (2) Temperate savannas are mid-latitude savannas with wetter summers and drier winters. They include such biomes as temperate grasslands and shrublands.<br>   <br>  (3) Mediterranean savannas are mid-latitude savannas in Mediterranean climate regions, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers, part of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and shrub biome. The oak tree savannas of California, part of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, fall into this category.<br>  <br>  (4) Flooded savannas are savannas that are flooded seasonally or year-round. They include flooded grasslands and shrublands biomes, and occur mostly in the tropics and subtropics.<br>  <br>  (5) Montane savannas are high-altitude savannas, located in a few spots around the world's high mountain regions, and include montane grasslands and shrublands biomes. The highland savannas of the Angolan scarp savanna and woodlands ecoregion are examples. <br>  <br>  There are many other biome designations related to savanna, including cerrado?, coastal plain, coastal prairie, flood-meadow, meadow, pasture, plain, prairie, rangeland, steppe, water-meadow, wet meadow, and veld.<br>  <br>  The most important human activity in savanna biomes is the grazing of domesticated animals, particularly cattle, sheep, goats, and horses.  As a consequence, some tree clearing has occurred, which increases the likelihood of fire.  Fire risk is also exacerbated by overgrazing.<br>  <br>  Many savanna regions have also been converted into cultivated croplands, primarily in the form of corn, wheat, soybeans, and a variety of fruit orchards.<br>  <br>  Humans have added some exotic plant species into savannas around the world. Among woody plant species are ecological "weeds" such as Prickly Acacia (Acacia nilotica), Rubbervine (Cryptostegia grandiflora), and Lantana (Lantana camara and L. montevidensis).  Other woody exotics added to savanna are Mesquite (Prosopis spp.) and Prickly Pear (Opuntia spp.).  A range of herbaceous species have also been introduced to the savanna woodlands, either deliberately or accidentally, including Rhodes grass and other Chloris species, Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), Giant rat's tail grass (Sporobolus pyramidalis), parthenium (Parthenium hysteropherous), stylos (Stylosanthes spp.), and several legumes. These introductions have the potential to significantly alter the structure and composition of savannas worldwide, and have already done so in many areas through a numbers of processes including altering the fire regime, increasing grazing pressure, competing with native vegetation, and occupying previously vacant ecological niches.

urgAxihFaa	Slight edit to your equation:<br>  <br>  C6H12O6 + 6 O2 --> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O +ATP<br>  <br>  in other words:<br>  <br>  Glucose + oxygen --> carbon dioxide + water + "energy" for cellular work<br>  <br>  How is a REALLY REALLY long answer (usually a full textbook chapter), but a very basic explanation is that the breakdown of glucose produces other molecules as byproducts, and these byproducts then "donate" electrons to specific enzyme processes that ultimate produce ATP. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in this chain of enzymes, and it combines with hydrogen to make water (this is why some desert animals don't have to drink water - they survive solely on the water produced from metabolic processes).<br>  <br>  CO2 is actually a byproduct/waste from early steps in this cycle.

dGN8YoEQaa	Yup...bee spit!  Mmm...<br>  <br>  Here are the details:<br>  <br>  Honeybees use nectar to make honey. Nectar is almost 80% water with some complex sugars. In fact, if you have ever pulled a honeysuckle blossom out of its stem, nectar is the clear liquid that drops from the end of the blossom. In North America, bees get nectar from flowers like clovers, dandelions, berry bushes and fruit tree blossoms. They use their long, tubelike tongues like straws to suck the nectar out of the flowers and they store it in their "honey stomachs". Bees actually have two stomachs, their honey stomach which they use like a nectar backpack and their regular stomach. The honey stomach holds almost 70 mg of nectar and when full, it weighs almost as much as the bee does. Honeybees must visit between 100 and 1500 flowers in order to fill their honeystomachs.<br>  <br>  The honeybees return to the hive and pass the nectar onto other worker bees. These bees suck the nectar from the honeybee's stomach through their mouths. These "house bees" "chew" the nectar for about half an hour. During this time, enzymes are breaking the complex sugars in the nectar into simple sugars so that it is both more digestible for the bees and less likely to be attacked by bacteria while it is stored within the hive. The bees then spread the nectar throughout the honeycombs where water evaporates from it, making it a thicker syrup. The bees make the nectar dry even faster by fanning it with their wings. Once the honey is gooey enough, the bees seal off the cell of the honeycomb with a plug of wax. The honey is stored until it is eaten. In one year, a colony of bees eats between 120 and 200 pounds of honey.|`|6ZU8Kt20aa	Actually I've heard it's bee vomit. They ingest nectar from flowers and then regurgitate it.

WkWedRnoaa	No.<br>  A light year is distance and does not correlate directly with actual years, which are time. <br>  <br>  Light from an object that we see at a distance of 4 light years left the object about four years ago. But light from objects that are billions of light years away is affected by the expansion of space (the universe is getting bigger) and by everything the light passes on its journey to us. <br>  <br>  As light leaves an object, it's photons travel in "straight" lines that are affected by matter and gravity. Matter such as solid objects (stars, planets, etc) can block the light, just as you do when you "see" anything, here on Earth or from space. The gravity produced by the matter, planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, can bend the path that the light takes.<br>  <br>  Light from an object that is far away at the time it is generated can travel billions of light years, which at the speed of light, corresponds to billions of years. BUT, while the light is travelling, the universe is expanding and the light gets "stretched" out along the way (red shift).<br>  Though light never exceeds the "speed of light", the distance that the light has travelled is determined by the amount of "stretching" (red shift) that it has undergone. When we finally see the light, we note its red shift and from that determine that the object is NOW 12.2 billion light years away from us. If the universe were not expanding, we could say that since the object is 12.2 billion light years away from us, it's light left 12.2 billion years ago, since it takes light one year to travel one light year. BUT the universe IS expanding, which allows light to look like it's travelling faster than the speed of light and thus, the object IS at 12.2 billion light years but it took less than 12.2 billion years for the light to reach us, so we are looking back in time to a point less than 12.2 billion years ago. I don't know the math, but it is theorectically possible to see light from objects at distances greater than 14 billion light years, even though the universe was created in the Big Bang only 13.7 billion years ago.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Yes. It takes light one year to travel one light year (hence the name).

I am not really sure if you can do anything to protect yourself before or during abduction, however, I was surprised to find that there are actually companies that offer UFO abduction insurance! This is one http://www.ufo2001.com/    What you can do after an abduction. Read on    Write down the sequence of events you experienced to the best of your memory's ability. Most abduction narratives take place at night when the abductee (you) is hypnotized by bright lights and teleported inside the space ship. Try to remember the details of what happened before you got on board.     Try to remember the appearance of the aliens inside the space ship. Drawing pictures will help you remember. Which parts of your body did they investigate? Draw pictures of their equipment.     Try to remember how they communicated with you. Did they speak broken English; did they talk to you telepathically? What did their native alien language sound like?     After you have written and drawn all the details of your abduction experience, contact a local UFO group. A Ufologist can help put your story in context of other abduction stories and can tell you about the different types of aliens that visit. If you have large gaps in your memory, contact a hypnotherapist to unlock your secrets.     Don't be alarmed if you find you have strange new habits and preferences. Some people report different food cravings after an abduction, or an increased interest in their bodies. Join an online support group for alien abductees.|`|51ffe1363d554561e1aea841802c65b5aa	The human mind only reacts one way in these situations, it's closes down reality and fragments come through and you feel terror because you can not move or register what is happening, praying is a good start.

Ti0q1Btiaa	This was scary for me.    When WW II ended, I was fooling with one.    I asked if my Aunt in Italy, my father's sister, was safe.  He had not had any contact with her for 30 years, as they had a falling out prior to that.    The ouija board spelled out yes.  Me: Does she have any children?  O: Yes.  Me: How many?  O: 5  Me:  Boys or girls?  O: Boys.    I quit using it.    A few days later, just a few days, my dad received a letter from his sister, addressed to an old address of 30 years ago.  Small town and the postmaster knew my dad, so it was forwarded to him.    His mother had died during the war while their home was occupied by the Germans.  Near Naples.  His sister, my aunt, her husband and, 5 Girls, were all safe.  The house next door to her and one across the street was bombed.  They were desperate.  Her husband had no clothes to go out and look for work.  Her girls, my cousins ,had only gowns that were made from bed sheets.    Long story short, my dad took as many clothes and shoes from 7 of us as he could, and sent them to Italy, as well as canned and dried food.  Later sent more on several occasions.    The ouija was wrong about boys, but was correct about 5.  And they were safe.

pfm0wcEIaa	Water boils at higher temperatures under pressure so your food cooks at a higher temperature.  Pressure cookers are more common in the mountains where elevation is higher.  At higher elevations, atmospheric pressure is lower and therefore water boils are lower temperatures.  In order to make up for that difference, people use pressure cookers.    This higher temperature is why it is so important to let a pressure cooker cool and take caution when opening it.  Pressure cookers are able to reach significantly higher temperatures which can cause serious injury if the pot opened when it is still too hot.|`|eSNQLaYuaa	Higher the atmospheric pressure higher is the boiling point of a substance.That's what exactly happens inside a pressure cooker.Due to the large amount of water vapor produced inside the cooker while cooking  the pressure inside the cooker becomes very high(even higher than atmospheric pressure).Thus the boiling point of water inside the cooker becomes very high.As we know,the temperature of a substance doesn't increase after reaching its boiling point.When we cook something in air(under the atmospheric pressure) water easily attains its b.p. of 100 deg.Celsius after which its temp. does not rise.thus the food is cooked at max 100 deg cel. ,But inside the pressure cooker where the water has very higher b.p. than 100deg.Celsius,the food is cooked at higher temperature,thereby making it cook faster.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	It's hotter under the pressure.|`|5QLmeijSaa	For the same sort of reason it takes longer on top of mt Everest... boiling point is related to pressure. The lower the atmospheric pressure, the longer it takes to cook something (a 3-minute boiled egg would take longer than 3 minutes to cook). Water would boil at a lower temperature, so it would take longer for the egg to cook.    A pressure cooker does the opposite- it raises pressure, which raises the boiling point of  water, and cooks the egg more quickly.|`|WQkyRBeRaa	Pressure is directly proportional to temperature. As the pressure increases so will temperature. How high the temperature is, is like how many gas atoms hit your food that is being cooked, so when more water turns into gas thus increasing pressure more gas atoms or specifically water vapor will hit your food. Also by increasing temperature the speed of the atoms increases, they become more aggressive and give them higher probability in hitting the food.    Ethan's answer is the OPPOSITE. Boiling happens when the vapor pressure of an object, let's say water, becomes equal to the surroundings.

Now if you move the wire in one direction, the current in the wire moves in one direction.  Now if you move the wire in the opposite direction, the current in that wire moves in the reverse direction.    Now in power generators... these wires are moved in a circular path next to some very LARGE magnets... now in circular motion.. and if we just take say the horizontal component of motion... wires spends half of the time moving in one direction, and the other half, moving in the opposite direction... hence the current that is in the wire switches direction every 1/2 cycle of the spin.

KwaRTC2Gaa	Let's start with the first one.    (1+tanx)tan2x  Put the (1 + tanx) term aside until we're done simplifying tan2x term    tan2x = tan(x + x) = (tanx + tanx)/(1 - tan^2(x))    = 2tanx/(1 - tanx)(1 + tanx)    Now, bring in the (1 + tanx) term. It would cancel out with the (1 + tanx) in the denominator of the above expression. Hence, our answer is:  2tanx/(1 - tanx)    Hence shown.    All the best with the rest of the problems!

To keep from having to remember a lot of digits the phone had a "number" that consisted of a word followed by 4 digits. So an exchange might be "TALMADGE" which you would tell the operator followed by the 4 digits. When they started to eliminate operators and have people dial, the phone "number" started with "TA5" with the 5 being on the same dial location as the L. Once they added area codes and tone dialing it all became numbers so "TAL" turned to "725" and the words only appeared in old movies (like the one titled "BUtterfield 8").|`|l0NRdN3Faa	I don't think there were letters on the old telephones.|`|ymEajDnqaa	they were used on 4 and 8 party lines,  432rb, br549 etc.|`|AfbjU9Guaa	OMG you're right!

Kind of like our cell phones.  The letters were associated with the exchange.  On a 10 digit phone number you have the area code, followed by a three number exchange, followed by your number.  Well, numbers for the exchange were substituted by the letters, so the phone number was easier to remember.  When you would tell someone your number, you would say Murry Hill 1234, Which would be MUH 1234.  Or like another answer said, Houndslow 1234 would be HOU 1234.|`|8BHJ1obLaa	Letters were used as the first three digits and denoted the district you were calling. like for instance in the Manchester district the area near the city centre was called blackfriers and the first three letter you dialled were BLA then the four numbers, BLA 1234.  hope you understand it.|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	Phone numbers used to be different. For example, a phone number that we know as 462-2222 in my area used to be known as HO2-2222, the HO stood for Howard, so you could also say Howard 2-2222 as a phone number. I remember there being Fulton9, Dewey3, Howard8 and a bunch of others.    Phone numbers began with two letters, depending upon where you lived. I suspect this was done before area codes to identify locations of phone numbers.

To dial a trunk call using S.T.D. you needed to dial 'O' first. This previously dialled the operator. The operator then became '100'. Conveniently the letter 'O' and zero were the same. The next digit depended on where you were dialling. If you were dialing a major city - London, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool or Manchester you needed to dial the code for that area. These were known as 'Director' areas. Before S.T.D. if you lived in a director area you could dial other numbers in the director area using the lettered exchange followed by the number. For example MAYfair 1240 was MAY-1240. That's 629-1240. To dial on S.T.D. from outside London you needed to dial 'O' followed by '1' - the code for London followed by MAI-1240 so  O-1-MAI-1240    The other director areas could be dialled by 'O' followed one of the following codes:  Birmingham  21  Edinburgh  31  Glasgow  41  Liverpool  51  Manchester  61    So that's 'O'-21 for Birmingham or 021 - sound familiar?|`|3VXGLhnMaa	Areas had the letters to indicate them    eg Hou=Houndslow.|`|AA10330431	They signified the exchange , ie  GRover 5-    .|`|yJ3GpnXAaa	In the old days, the telephone dial was only used for that - dialling the number you want to get through to.    Phone numbers consisted of three letters, followed by three or four numbers depending how many phone lines had been installed in the area, eg WOR 1234, or SOU 345 (I'm making these up, but you get the drift).    The letters were an abbreviation of the exchange and whereas today the exchange goes by a number such as 01634, years ago they had names such as Worcester or Southend - the letters represented the exchange.  That's why there are letters on a dial-face phone.
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	First off, don't go to NC, tsk tsk (just playing Dr. Kriss, I went to VT so I cannot encourage attendance to any other ACC school for engineering...)    As for what college is "right", that depends on more than just the college's reputation.  You don't want to go to school for something like engineering and be unhappy for 4-5 years just to have a certain university on your degree.  Look at schools with solid engineering reputations, then among them look for the other things that will be part of your college experience.    Close to home or far away?  North or south, east or west?  Football or basketball team?  Amenities important (gym, student center, etc)?  Any old friends from high school going?  All of these things are important.    For civil engineering, I recommend you look at the following (mostly east coast schools, I'm not greatly familiar with the western stuff)    Virginia Tech  NC State  Clemsen  UNC  MIT (if you've got money and happen to be brilliant)  Purdue  Lehigh (its in PA, and it is very good)  RPI (Rochester Polytech, in NY)    There are a ton more, there are lots of schools out there, you need to look at what fits you personally the best.  Also, its a good idea when talking to their representatives to ask about their job placement numbers, for both graduates and interns (internships are the most important part!).  Specifically try to get some numbers, rather than answers like "prospects are good".

UNC Charlotte, NC State, Clemson, Viginia Tech, Purdue, MIT, UC San Diego.... the list goes for schools that have good engineering programs but it also depends on you as a person and how you fit in with the university. i loved the social and campus life of NC State but the professors, i found, to be ineffective and boring.|`|WPPIaLORaa	Berkeley  Stanford  Cal Tech  UCLA

OXsRXLx1aa	I'm not at home with my most favorite of fluid dynamics books right now so I'll have to extrapolate from the wiki page:<br>  <br>  Assume your concentric pipes are similar to a wide plane that just keeps going (a circle never ends). In this case you can reduce your revolving problem down into a simple flat-plate problem.

And the system seems very similar to a shaft inside a bearing rotating to me. As I said though, not in front of my books right now so I can't tell you for sure.<br>  <br>  I'm having second thoughts though; if the increase in Diameter is very large then you can't assume it's a flat plane because the integral of area grows as you grow in radius (meaning your velocities do not follow a linear deceleration as I am assuming above).

AA10335036	PE = -GMm/r (See the ref.)<br>  Surface PE = -m*6.252E-7 J<br>  PE at 2r altitude above surface = -m*2.084E7 J<br>  work = ΔPE = m*4.168E7 J<br>  This is substantially in agreement with what the 2nd answer would yield assuming 2r distance from the surface.<br>  So far all this gets you is a stationary satellite ready to fall back to earth. If you want to put it in circular orbit, you need to add kinetic energy KE equal to -0.5 * the PE at altitude, or m*1.042E7 J, for a total value of work = m*5.210E7 J.<br>  BTW, if by "height 2 R from the earth" you meant 2r from the center, just substitute <br>  -m*3.126E7 J for the PE at altitude value above and make the corresponding corrections to the rest of the numbers.|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	The minimum energy is the difference between the weight of the satellite on the surface (W), at R, and in orbit (w), at 2R times the distance R the satellite is lifted above the surface.  This results because the respective weights are just the potential energies at each location.  And the change in potential energy PE - pe = W - w = work.<br>  <br>  Thus WE = W - w = mgR - GmMR/(2R)^2 = mR(GM/R^2 - GM/4R^2) = GmMR/R^2 (1 - 1/4) = (3/4) RGmM/R^2 = (3/4) mgR.  Thus the work needed to lift the satellite is WE = (3/4) 250*9.81*R.  Look up R in meters and solve the problem.  g = 9.81 m/sec^2 on Earth's surface.<br>  <br>  BTW: The other answer erred in assuming g was a constant value throughout the lift.

G5QC5f5baa	The motor speed (S) is proportional to the back emf divided by the flux of the field (f). The back emf is the applied voltage (V) minus the voltage drop in the external (Re) and internal (Ri) series resistances. Therefore, S = (V-I(Re+Ri)k/f where k is a constant of proportionality. Solving for k/f given V = 400, Re = 0, Ri = 0.2 I = 25 & S = 1000 gives k/f = 2.532. Since the field flux is proportional to the current, substitute the current for f, assume k includes the constant of proportionality for current vs. field flux and set k = 2.532 x 25 = 63.29. Then for field current = 20 amps, k/f = 3.165. Solving for S with I = 20 and Re = 2 and k = 3.165 gives S = 1127.<br>  <br>  You would expect the speed to decrease when inserting a series resistance, but the load torque has apparently decreased offsetting the effect of the series resistance.

YYLybWHSaa	Vertebrate animals that include both the mammals and the avians never have 6 limbs. Both groups evolved from the tetrapod with a master body plan that has been retained. The regulatory sequence of events is controlled by the Hox clusters that determine the geography of the developing embryo. The Hox genes set up the body axes that map out the locations of the pairs of limbs and their proportions.<br>  The Hox genes then work with master design genes so the correct limb or organ is grown in its Hox designated spot. Sonic hedgehog is involved in mapping the fate of limb bud growth. The exact involvement of these interacting genes is not yet known but they are essential for proper limb growth & organization.<br>  <br>  What the griffin has that has never appeared in 300 million years are three pairs of limbs. The griffin has both the usual forelimbs and the wings avians have adapted from the basic forelimbs.  Wings are homologous to the lions forelegs. The griffin has both sets of forelimbs and hindlimbs.<br>  <br>  To construct a griffin would be no different than making a six legged lion. It would require a body segment duplication so the thorax was twice as long to allow both forelimb sets. Next the genes that modify the forelimb to become a wing in avian embryology would have to be added. Further these genes would all have to be choreographed in time and space to work synchronously so the embryo grows to a mature and functional animal. Nature takes millions of years to test each stepwise change that produces a nonlethal combination. It might take a bit less since humans would have a goal unlike natural selection that simply promotes those with the best current combination of traits in the current environment.<br>  <br>  Since all bodies with Hox cluster modular patterns have experienced duplications to produce more segments. After all the hind limbs are just serially homologous limbs duplicating the forelimbs then specializing so the limb pairs do different jobs. Why did nature never produce a third limb pair? Why are there no vertebrates with three pairs of limbs? The combination may be lethal on some level because of a limitation set by the inability to isolate the limbs regulations in growth from other organs that  use the same genes in development.<br>  These are papers on current knowledge of the evolution of the genetic positioning and identification of vertebrate limbs in bodies.<br>  <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118734640/abstract" rel="nofollow">http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journ...</a><br>  <a href="http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/127/24/5233.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/12...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1594969&blobtype=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrend...</a><br>  Mouse forelimb/hindlimb patterning genes<br>  <a href="http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/144/1/249" rel="nofollow">http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abst...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1554/05-233.1" rel="nofollow">http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1554/05...</a>|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Not easily.<br>  <br>  You definitely can't use eagle sperm to get a lion pregnant.

On a rotating wheel, this is not the case.<br>  <br>  On a rotating wheel, points on the rim are travelling much faster than points near the hub; since the acceleration increases as the square of the velocity, the points on the rim require a much greater centripetal acceleration than points near the hub--in order to remain part of the wheel, at any rate.<br>  <br>  This is actually a key design consideration in such devices as hard disk drives for computers.|`|QUIR4LZraa	a=v^2/r so as the radius increases, acceleration decreases.|`|DrwY7dJCaa	F = mv^2 / r<br>  The further away from the centre, r gets bigger => F gets smaller.<br>  Therefore accerlation greater for points near the hub.

dGN8YoEQaa	You can house them inside or outside.  I would suggest reading the below before housing them outside:<br>  <br>  Housing a ferret--><br>  <br>  So you have made the decision that you want to house a pet ferret, now you need to get all the ferret supplies that your new pet will need to live a happy healthy life in your home. With their cage, you can get a multilevel condo so they can go up and down the different floors, you can get a standard cage with one floor, or you can go the full hoot and give them the allowance of an entire room that you ferret proof. <br>  <br>  Obviously you will want to do what’s best for your ferret but you may also be limited to the amount of room you can give to your ferret. Remember that they don’t always stay in the cage, so if you have to settle for a smaller cage, you can make it up to them by allowing them plenty of freedom around the home too.<br>  <br>  You could also house your ferret outside, although if you do this, it is best to let them outside in the summer months first, this way they can naturally adjust with the weather as it changes to colder temperatures. If you keep your ferret outside they must have shade to shelter under from high temperatures and should never be left in direct sunlight. You must provide a shelter box for them to sleep in with plenty of straw or other warm nesting to keep them warm. The entire enclosure should be covered with a roof so they are protected from wind and rain at all times.<br>  <a href="http://www.ferretcare.org/housing.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretcare.org/housing.php</a>|`|axKQq9nXaa	It is always nice to let them go outside from time to time but it is NOT cruel to keep them inside.  There are very strict laws that surround ferrets due to the damage they could do to local wildlife and the environment.  Thus there could be very strict laws for your area that might permit you from even taking a walk outside.  Breaking such laws can result in fines or they could even take your animals away.<br>  <br>  The only way the animals can be taken away from you is if you break laws or if you have them in inhumane conditions (living in their own flith, no food, no water, etc, etc, etc)<br>  <br>  If you mom says not to bother make sure she is aware that you could have fines thrown at you.

It is more cruel to keep ferrets outside then it is to keep them inside.<br>  <br>  Ferrets outside are more susceptible to parasites like flea & ticks, and also heartworm. They can easily become the target for a loose dog/cat.

PLEASE for the love of your ferrets don't make them live outdoors.|`|LGyVasfbaa	I believe that your uncle likely has little to no actual knowledge about the proper care of ferrets. ;) <br>  It is absolutely not cruel to keep ferrets inside, as long as they have: proper food(a high quality ferret or kitten food), water, bedding (enough towels and old sheets for them to be comfy!), their litter box is changed often, sufficient exercise and mind stimulating activity (I'd say at the very least 2 hours a day), a large enough cage for them to live comfortably in, grooming, a ferret-proofed home to run around in during their play time, and veterinarian care. <br>  As long as your ferrets have all of these things, it sure doesn't sound like a 'cruel' existence to me!<br>  As a matter of fact, though I'm sure there are people who properly keep their ferrets outside, you'd be getting closer to "cruel" if you put them out there, as you're exposing them to potential predatory animals, fleas and ticks, the elements (bad weather, extreme heat or cold), thieves, escape, etc. The list is endless. <br>  I'd especially recommend that you not listen to your mother and uncle if you signed an agreement because yes, he can be taken away from you for that, and you may even be faced with penalties from the law. <br>  Personally, I think you should direct your uncle to a good, informative ferret book- as most of these will say outdoor living, in most cases, is not suitable.

4c2daec05f4f88483fd1490ee194945aaa	The photon is just the smallest possible unit of electromagnetic energy.  Photons always travel at the speed of light, so a cluster of photons is a light beam pulse.  The energy of a photon is h where h is Planck's constant and  is its frequency.  That energy has a relativistic mass equivalent.    The view of general relativity is not that the mass-equivalence of a photon exerts a gravitational force.  It's that the rest mass of matter warps spacetime, and that any photon travels along a strict linear geodesic path through that warped spacetime.  I don't think that a passing photon interacts with a mass it passes, though that's an interesting question to pursue.    Take a look at Maxwell's Equations.  They show how charges and currents influence electromagnetic fields.  But set all of the charges and currents to zero, and set all the other constants to their free-space values.  Now the equations represent just how changing electric and magnetic fields interact.  A packet of EM energy (a photon) in free space is sometimes stored in the electric field, and sometimes in the magnetic field.  There is never any charge involved, just an electric field induced by a changing magnetic field, and a magnetic field induced by a changing electric field.    A photon does not have a refractive index.  That is a property of matter.  That's how an object, like a lens or prism, can bend the path of a photon.  And for a prism, if the refractive index varies with frequency, that's why it can bend red and blue light by different amounts.    I hope that helps.  I like your thinking!
QEEweJUaaa	Home Topics WeatherSnow Britain: (Heavy snow forecast for rest of week)   Arctic blizzards and heavy snow will batter the country for the remainder of the week with a further six inches to 1ft of snow expected in the next 24 hours.      As heavy snowfall hits the UK, our economy sets about weathering the storm. ;    More than six million people have been forced to stay at home and thousands of airline passengers are stranded after almost 1ft of snow fell in some parts.     Now a second mass of freezing clouds moving up from France is expected to bring further wintry storms.     Parts of Northumberland and North Yorkshire could be left with 16 ins of snow by Tuesday while the rest of the country will have up to 1ft, the Met Office has warned.     Snow is forecast across the country until Friday, although the flurries will become less severe and turn to sleet as the week draws to a close.     With at least 2,000 schools closed and rail, road and air transport paralysed the disruption is expected to cost the economy 1.2 billion.     Airlines alone could face a 10 million bill from cancelled flights.     Meanwhile the Arctic conditions claimed their first tragedy after a mountain rescue team searching for two brothers missing on Snowdon found two bodies.     The men, who have not yet been named, were walking in the area at the weekend and had not been heard from since they telephoned their wives on Saturday.     In Redditch, Worcestershire, a teenage boy was treated for hypothermia after falling into an icy lake.     Emergency services were stretched to the limit dealing with hundreds of road accidents and weather related incidents.     The London Ambulance has announced that it will only respond to life threatening emergencies after dealing with 650 calls in seven hours overnight.     With a band of snow stretching up the eastern side of Britain from Aberdeen to the English Channel, the Met Office said that it was the most widespread snowfall for 18 years.     The North Downs and the Pennines were worst hit making roads impassable and crippling some of the busiest rail routes in the country.     The satellite navigation maker TomTom measured one traffic jam on the M25 around London as 32 miles long, cutting through four counties.     In London the Old Bailey did not sit, while trading volumes on the stock market were down by about 50 per cent.     With the entire fleet of London buses out of action, and services on all but one Tube line severely curtailed, a handful of commuters took to skiing through the streets of London.     In Kent police had to issue a special safety warning after a man was seen travelling on a sleigh attached to the back of a van after his car broke down.     Thousands of airline passengers were stranded at airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Southampton, Luton, Leeds Bradford and London City after snow forced the closure of runways and the cancellation of hundreds of flights.     Passengers arriving back from skiing holidays were bemused to find themselves virtually stranded because of snow.     Several honeymooners were among 300 passengers from a flight bound for the Maldives stranded at Heathrow because of a snowstorm.     Jo Toscano, 29, who was on board with her new husband Phil, 36, said: "The captain came on the tanoy and said it was the worst weather he had seen in 16 or 17 years of flying."     At Gatwick passengers described chaos in the terminals with trains to the airport suspended and taxis unable to get there by road.     Schools in Essex, Surrey, Kent, North Yorkshire, East Riding, London, Birmingham, the West Midlands and East Anglia were closed.     Some of Britain's busiests roads and motorways were partially closed by accidents including several jack-knifed lorries.     They included the M25 around London, the M1 in Northamptonshire, the A1(M) at Leeds, the M3 in Hampshire, the A3 in Surrey,and the A66 in Cumbria.     All London buses - used by six million people a day - were suspended while 10 of the 11 Tube lines in the capital were also affected.     On the railways, all Southeastern trains in and out of London from Kent and Sussex were suspended, busy South West Trains routes were down to one train every two hours.     Meanwhile First Great Western services from the South West were unable to proceed beyond Reading in Berkshire.     The AA warned motorists to ensure they keep warm clothes in the car after dealing with unprepared drivers "flirting with hypothermia" at breakdowns during the last big freeze.     Meanwhile as many as 20,000 people planning to travel to and from the Continent suffered disruption as Eurostar staff struggled to get to work.     A Eurostar spokesman said earlier trains had run normally but staff were now unable to get to work so trains were subject to delay and cancellation.

0FMdZzECaa	Hey Kristie!    That is a very complex question you have asked. I will, however, try to explain it in the most simple way, away from all the boring medical details!    Vit D, is classified as a Fat Soluble vitamin.    Present in our diet, are substances called sterols, namely: ergocalciferol (in vegetables and plants we eat), and cholesterol (in meat we eat).    Now, these sterols are stored in the liver. When we are exposed to sunlight, the UV rays modify the chemical structure of Vit D via the skin tissues, in such a way, where the liver and kidneys will be able to activate Vit D for the real use in our body.    So basically it is stored, UV prepares it, liver and kidney activate it, body uses it!    The main uses, quite simply, are bone health and immune system preservation.    I hope I was of help!    God bless.|`|EN32vSsCaa	Sunlight converts cholesterol to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in the presence of UVB rays.
HQ4PsETWaa	Farming provides jobs and income, but it hurts the environment, it leads to deforestation and erosion.   Most LEDC's don't have the regulations to protect the environment from the pesticides and poor farming practices.  This is a necessity to all nations.      Tourism brings in money and creates jobs.  But it usually leads to a two class system, the wealthy minority and poor majority.  Tourism does not allow for the development of a strong middle class.      Industry, creates jobs and wealth.  But again with weak environmental protections is not good for the environment.  It has horrible impacts to air and water quality.  This is the best for a society, because it creates the three class system, with the majority being middle class.|`|NoZAofgOaa	OK well positive-  the farming could produce herbs, veggies, and other things, that could bring in a profit.  tourism and industry all well.    i think....  they could use...      the money earned  from one thing could be used to advance in another category causing an even bigger profit.      and the negative would be that when they in prove in the industry and build more stores shops and other buildings... that could led to pollution.|`|DvGJ50zQaa	So that we can get around the world and also we can be so  that we can make our money count and we can take the our that our world would nice to.

So the amount of layers you need would be the amount of layers needed to fill this constriction.    Because 1 layer actually takes 2 layers off of the overall width of the room (Opposite walls) you can work out that:    Width of room - (2 x number of layers x thickness of layer) = new width      If we want to end up a fully enclosed space then the new width of the room = 0    So a simple equation   Width of room = 2 * no. of layers * thickness of layer    Lets say that layer thickness is 0.2mm    The width of the room is 6 x 12 = 72 inches    0.2 millimeters = 0.00787401575 inches    so 72 = 2 * no of layers * 0.00787401575     no of layers = 36/0.00787401575    So that would make 4572 layers needed|`|5al0K3N0aa	201 548 458 447 448 362 154.251    That's quite a bit dude.

uPVnqbE8aa	Cow and chickens are not the problem.  They are "raised" in captivity as food for mankind, and as such, serve a good purpose, no matter how many are killed.  They would not exist otherwise.  We must have protein in our diets, and, unless you are willing to eat insects, they are the best source.  The problem is with the fish. 99% of the fish we eat are taken from the oceans of the world.  This cannot last.  As our population explodes because of ancient religious beliefs that say it's sinful to use contraception and/or we must breed like rats, we will continue to use up all the natural resources the Earth has to offer, including all the fish in the sea.  We MUST learn to farm fish, like we already do store-bought Trout, and this also includes the Lobsters, Crabs, and Clams we eat.  Ocean farming must be learned and practiced if the animals of the sea have any chance for a future.  If they die, the oceans of the world die, and if the oceans die, we die.  It's a fact.

ggBfHk1waa	Tuesday, February 17, 2009.     Itll be possible to spot all five visible planets tonight.    Youll need to look outside just after sunset to see Venus, by far the brightest of these five worlds. If you do look shortly after the sun goes down, Venus is easily seen in the west. An hour or two after sunset, Saturn will shine in the east. Saturn is no where near as bright as Venus, but it shines as brilliantly as a bright star, with a steadier light than the stars.    The other three planets  Mercury, Mars and Jupiter  wont climb into the sky until the wee hours before sunrise. Youll have to be up at or before dawn to catch these morning planets. Throughout February, these wandering worlds will move with repect to each other in the eastern predawn sky. Tomorrow, Jupiter and Mars will pair up. A week from now, Jupiter will be closer to Mercury. By the months end, Mercury will pair up with Mars.    How soon you see this trio of planets before sunrise will depend on where you live worldwide. In the southern hemisphere, Mercury, Mars and Jupiter will climb above the horizon when its still dark  before morning twilight starts to color the sky. In the northern hemisphere, this planetary threesome will be somewhat obscured in the glow of dawn.     http://www.earthsky.org/radioshows/52944...

(The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.    That is all. Everything else is bull.    The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar.

Sorry|`|bp2btfyEaa	alright first you need to find your slope, by using y2-y1 / x2-x1  to get 2 = m alright now that was the hard part... now you choose one of your ordered pairs( you usually want to choose the easier one. Avoid fractions negatives... you realy want 0's) y-6= 2(x-3) thats the point slope of ther first and the second is y-2= 2(x-1) now to do anything further just solve them which basically means simplify|`|BxNsuxhxaa	ok, so in the first set, 3 is the x and 6 is the y. the next one is 1 is x and 2 is y.   to find the slope you need to do y2 minus y1 over (like a fraction) x2 minus x1  the set thats 1 and 2 is set number one because the x is smaller (very important).  so you equation should look like 2-6 (and below the fraction line is) 1-3  so you get -4 over -2   that simplifies into  negative one half-- THATS YOUR SLOPE      now, you plug you numbers into the point slope equation. (for the y0 and x0 use whatever set you want-- it totally doesn't matter) im gonna use the easier one (1 and 2)    you get     y-2= -1/2 (x-1)  use distributive property so do   y-2= -1/2x -1/2  then you gotta isolate the y variable so    y-2+2= -1/2x -1/2 +2  see you add 2 to both sides to get rid of it. so   -1/2 + 2 = 1.5 (or 1 and 1/2)    now you've got    y=-1/2x + 1 and 1/2!!!!  Thats it!!!!      Hey, don't freak out, but you might wanna consider a tutor. It took me a while to learn this too, but that was the beginning of eighth grade (ya im a freshman next year)    Hope this helps, and  EMAIL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS :) HAPPY TO HELP :)      by the way, no offense, but im pretty positive robert s did the math wrong. Im getting 101.3% in algebra right now so i think im right. Sorry to sound concieted.|`|XUf7rJh9aa	okay, look: (x0,y0) are coordinates given in a problem,like (3,6) in your example, so you already know the point, because you are given the coordinates. m is the slope, and the formula for the slope is: m=y2-y1/x2-x1 where (x1,y1) is a point, and (x2,y2) is another point, just like the points in your example: (3,6) and (1,2). so let's solve your example:    first we have to find the slope:  m=y2-y1/x2-x1  m=2-6/1-3  m=-4/-2  m=2  now we plug in the slope in the fomula;  y-y0=m(x-x0)  for (x0,y0), we choose one  of the two point, so either (3,6) or (1,2)  i am going to choose (1,2)  y-2=2(x-1)  y-2=2x-2  y=2x and that is the point- slope equation:)  i hope i helped and i know that maybe u get this a lot but its very true: if u try hard u can achieve anything, so if u really work hard and believe in yourself, you won't have any problems in math or life, and who knows, maybe you'll even get to love math:) cheers|`|p4nresGGaa	Don't worry, this confuses loads of people. Once you figure it out it's pretty straightforward. In my maths class we use x1 and y1 cos it's easier to label but you can use 0s too.     What you have to do to get the equation of the line is get:  - the slope  - any point on the line    If your question gives you the slope, you can skip this bit. If it doesn't, here's how you find it.   You have to use the formula   m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)  This is the slope formula which you usually need to learn off.   Don't get confused with the y1, y2 etc. They are just ways of knowing which number you are talking about.   Every point has an x and a y: the first number is always the x and the second is always the y. When you see x1, y1, and things like that, it's just a way of telling these apart when you've got more than one point.   What you should do is label them.   Take your first point - it doesn't matter which one you start with but I'll show it with (3, 6). 3 is first so it's the x, so we call it x1. That means the 6 must be y1.   Now we know 3 = x1 and 6 = y1. We do the same with the next point. (1, 2)... 1 = x2 and 2 = y2.   Now you put these numbers into the slope formula:  m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)  m = (2 - 6) / (1 - 3)  m = -4 / -2  m = 2  Now we have a slope, which we can use to find the equation of the line.     Your formula for this is:  y - y0 = m(x - x0)   but I am going to use y1 and x1 instead as it's easier to see. It really doesn't matter what you use - I could use y65 and x65, it wouldn't make any difference.   y - y1 = m(x - x1)  Now we use our m, x1 and y1 values that we got already. We know:  m = 2  x1 = 3  y1 = 6  So we put these into the equation.   Don't worry about the x and y that don't have numbers after them - they will simply stay there.   y - y1 = m(x - x1)  y - 6 = 2(x - 3)  y - 6 = 2x - 6  Bring everything to the same side, and start with the x number.   -2x + y - 6 + 6 = 0  It's easier if the x value is not negative so change all signs.   2x - y + 6 - 6 = 0  The + 6 - 6 cancels itself out so we are left with  2x - y = 0  This is the equation of the line.|`|BUk03epyaa	I can try to explain...    y=mx+b is the formula for a straight line.     the question gave you two points, which is enough information to solve this problem.    1. Substitute 'x' and 'y' into the formula , so that now you have two different formulas, like this:     Equation 1 is 6=m(3)+b  Equation 2 is 2=m(1)+b    2. Now that you have these two formulas, you can either use substitution or elimination to solve this problem.     Lets use substitution!    solve for a variable in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation, lets try it:    6=3m+b and 2=1m+b    solve for 'm' or 'b' in the first equation, but i will do 'b' since it doesn't have a number in front of it, it looks easier!    b=6-3m  (Lets call this equation 3)    Now substitute equation 3 into equation 2 (put it in the place of 'b' in equation 2)    2=m+(6-3m)    ...now expand and simplify this equation    2=m+6-3m  (bring all numbers to one side and variables to the other side of the equal sign)    2-6=m-3m  -4= -2m    (divide both sides by '-2' to solve for 'm'.     m=2    to find 'b' you should substitute m=2 into equation 3.    b=6-3(2)  b=6-6  b=0    therefore, equation is:    y=2x+0  (that's your answer)! :)|`|yH8Gnm4yaa	Sorry i don't really know anything about your problem, but you aren't stupid.

AA12350771	OK, for the first part of the question, it's probably the frequency part that's throwing you. 1 has a frequency of 3, meaning it appears 3 times. 2 appears 7 times, 3 appears 13 times and so on. So in order to find the mean, you need to know the sum of the numbers:<br>  <br>  (1*3) + (2*7) + (3*13) + (4*10) + (5*7)<br>  = 3 + 14 + 39 + 40 +35<br>  = 131.<br>  <br>  You then need to divide this number by the total frequency. The total frequency is calculated by summing them, so:<br>  <br>  3 + 7 + 13 + 10 + 7 = 40.<br>  <br>  So your average is the total divided by the frequency, which is:<br>  <br>  131 / 40 = 3.275<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To get the standard deviation, you need to subtract each number by the mean you've just worked out. So:<br>  <br>  1 - 3.275, 1 - 3.275, 1 - 3.275, 2 - 3.275 and so on. These are known as the deviations.<br>  <br>  You then square each of these deviations, so that all the numbers are now positive. <br>  <br>  You then sum these figures, which should give you 53.975.<br>  <br>  You divide this figure by the sample size minus 1. The sample size is 40 (this is the sum of the frequencies i.e. how often each number appears) so 1 less than this is 39.<br>  <br>  53.975 / 39 = 1.383974.<br>  <br>  Finally (!) you take the square root of this number, so the square root of 1.383974 = 1.176424, or 1.176 rounded to 3 decimal places.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|0def2e0a3bf9a1003fbbef29df921a6eaa	1.  Okay, let's start with the mean.<br>  <br>  mean = total value / number of values<br>  total value = 1*3 + 2*7 + 3*13 + 4*10 + 5*7<br>  total value = 3 + 14 + 39 + 40 + 35 = 131<br>  number of values = 3+7+13+10+7 = 40<br>  mean = 131 / 40 = 3.275<br>  Answer A, B or D fit the value.  What is the approrate rounding.  The least number of significant digits in the question is 1, so the answer should have that many significant digits.  D is the closest with only 2 significant digits.<br>  <br>  2.  The standard deviation<br>  Determine the square of the distance from the mean for each value.  Because several elements have the same value, we can use some multiplication to save ourselves some time.  The sample standard deviation is the square root of [ the sum of the squares of the differences of each element from the mean divided by one less than the number of elements ].  For a population mean, you do not subtract one from the number of elements.  Okay, that is a little wordy.  Let's try it this way.<br>  <br>  First determine the square of the difference from the mean for each value.<br>  (3.275 - 1)^2 = 2.275^2 = 5.175625<br>  (3.275 - 2)^2 = 1.275^2 = 1.625625<br>  (3.275 - 3)^2 = 0.275^2 = 0.075625<br>  (3.275 - 4)^2 = 0.275^2 = 0.525625<br>  (3.275 - 5)^2 = 0.275^2 = 2.975625<br>  <br>  There are 3 1-elements and 7 2-elements, etc.  Multiply their frequency the the squares of their differences and add them up.<br>  <br>  5.175625*3 +  1.625625*7 + 0.075625*13 + 0.525625*10 + 2.975625*7<br>  = 53.975<br>  Divide this number by the number of elements (40) to get the population variance.  Reduce the count by 1 (39) to get the sample variance.  This reduction in count is due to a reduction in the degrees of freedom for a sample.<br>  53.975 / 39 = 1.383974359<br>  The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.<br>  sqrt(1.383974359) = 1.1764243958<br>  Answers A, B, and D are all valid roundings of this answer.  Again, which answer matches the closest to one significant digit?  D is the best answer.

WPPIaLORaa	The basic point is that building a complicated molecule such as a protein is a coupled reaction.  The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + P releases energy that is used to create the chemical bonds (in this case peptide bonds) that hold the protein together.  That is, some of the energy from the ATP bonds is transferred to the peptide bonds.  The rest of the energy just heat.|`|ed77b684631a15604ec6d6ba1f0a55daaa	lol, well I can cetainly say that the Biology there is correct, I've always had a pretty good memory for Biology and that is the exact same thing I learned.    And I'm pretty sure that the chemistry is more or less right, however it actually comes down to whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. And so depending on the molecule joining or breaking will depend whether it needs energy to break or it releases energy when it breaks.    So actually in this case, it's not enough information on the chemistry side, even though your biology teacher was completely unhelpful in just saying your chemistry teacher is wrong!    The reason in those cases the chemistry is wrong, is because they are different kinds of reactions.    In those chemistry definitions I'm pretty sure it should read "In exothermic reactions bond breaking always causes... and bond making always causes..." and then another set of rules similar for endothermic reactions.    I can't remember the name of it, but you do a cycle thing to work out how much energy needs to go in, and how much will come out when different molecules react together to work out over all in the making or forming if energy is given out or taken in!    I hope that help a little and I haven't confused you!|`|Ne5I7Ranaa	Your biology teacher is right.

They were four digits and a decimal place. For the Next Generation they were increased to five digits to give the idea that about 100 years had passed. All began with a 4, and the second digit represented the season number. The remaining three were random, but ascended as the season progressed. The season 3 cliffhanger The Best Of Both Worlds took place on 'Stardate 43989.1', for example. (Yes, I did recall that date from memory, yes I know that's quite sad. In my defence it is the only one I remember, and that's mainly because it was written on the VHS sleeve...).    The dating system carried on through DS9 and Voyager, though of course the numbers now really didn't mean a thing in terms of the seasons, except that roughly 1000 units represented a year, so each season premiere was dated approximately 1000 units from the previous one. It is roughly possible, therefore, to work out the order of events in the Star Trek Universe from TNG onwards using the stardates, though I seem to recall there were a few mistakes.|`|YdGsp59kaa	In the original series they were simply chosen at random.    In the Next Generation the season number was encoded as the second digit, with the lesser significant digits distributed evenly throughout the season.    I wrote a computer program a long time ago that produced a pseudo-stardate by combining the astronomical Julian day with the elapsed fraction of the sidereal day.  It has no bearing on the TV show and very little bearing on stars, but it did have the virtue of incrementing in a believable way as time passed.

8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Believe it or not, snow actually helps small animals to keep warm during the winter! Snow acts as a thermal insulator, trapping the warm air produced by the animals, just like your winter coat traps the warm air from your body to keep you warm.    Snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator, conserving the heat of the Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop growth.    Spring snow melt is a major source of water supply to areas in temperate zones near mountains that catch and hold winter snow, especially those with a prolonged dry summer. In areas near mountains, people have harvested snow and stored it as layers of ice covered by straw or sawdust in icehouses. This allowed the ice to be used in summer for refrigeration or medical uses.|`|su3vWi8maa	Snow gives us fun.  And heating bills.

If too much of it melts away however it is unable to do so, so less heat is reflected back, and the earth gets warmer, resulting in more melting of the snow/ice. That is sort of what is happening with global warming.

It is the subject of astrobiology and its existence remains hypothetical, because there is no credible evidence of extraterrestrial life which has been generally accepted by the mainstream scientific community. Hypotheses regarding the origin(s) of extraterrestrial life, if it indeed exists, are as follows: one proposes that it may have emerged, independently, from different places in the universe. An alternative hypothesis is panspermia, which holds that life emerges from one location, then spreads between habitable planets. These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The study and theorization of extraterrestrial life is known as astrobiology, exobiology or xenobiology.

1c635f446d91828fc99f4dc9a1a95a3baa	Black holes distorts space the same way ALL matter distorts space.  <br>  <br>  Any mass, whether it be a baseball, super giant star, or a black hole (especially a super massive black hole).  Space is not "nothingness."  It has properties.  We don't fully understand it but we are pretty sure that a mass in space creates a sort of pit (all around).  The higher the amount of matter (the more massive) the greater the pit.  Imagine having a thin flat sheet of rubber.  If you place a baseball on it, it will sink into the sheet.  If you put a bowling ball on it, it will sink further.  If you drop a ball of gold, the same volume as the baseball, you'll notice the gold ball sinks even further (more mass packed in the same amount of space, means more dense material).  These are all examples of what planets, stars, neutron stars, and black holes do to the space around it.<br>  Hence, space is distorted.  Any objects crossing that distortion must follow the contour, think of the event horizon as "coming over the hill" into a steep decline.<br>  <br>  As for time, this is a perception issue, relative to the location/actions of the observers involved.  Time is a relative measurement and is not really based on any particular law of nature.  As you enter the event horizon and "continue" on, you are accelerated to the speed of light.  Our perception of time changes at or near this speed.  Think of you as being suspended, but not necessarily forever, you'll see events outside of the black horizon move on much faster, to your perception, you are still operating at the same speed as always.  To observers outside of the event horizon, they will see you in suspension, or if you were close to the speed of light they would see you moving very slowly over a long period of time.<br>  <br>  If you were to enter a black hole and when you emerged (this is all theoretical of course), one hundred years have passed on Earth.  Well, in Earth time, you are technically 100 years older than when you entered the black hole.  You may not look or feel 100 years older, but you are.  To you, the watch you were wearing, and the computers on board your black hole ship, you may only be day older (for example).|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	It's gravity, my dear. Same gravity that keeps you on the ground, and same gravity that keeps the Earth orbiting the Sun. The Sun distorts time and space, the Earth distorts time and space, and even you distort time and space. All objects in the Universe do.<br>  <br>  Only the gravity of a black hole is so strong that you'd have to be travelling faster than the speed of light in order to escape it, which is impossible.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it's incorrect to say that a black hole destroys time and space, but you never know. In my own understanding, the gravity of a black hole is so strong that it literally creates a hole in spacetime by ripping it apart. That would mean that below the event horizon, there is no space or time at all, and any objects that cross the event horizon just cease to exist.<br>  <br>  Pretty crazy, I know, but that's why I love science.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	image space as a bed sheet pulled tight at all corners, a black hole would be like a bowling ball being put in the middle so the sheet (space) is drooping down in the middle, this being the effect of its immense gravity.  This drooping down has distorted space and time, time is distorted because it now takes it longer to go from one side of the sheet to the other because it has that gravity droop in the middle.  In reality the sheet would droop down to infinity and look more like a bottomless cone but I'm hoping you get the point.<br>  <br>  This is the best i can explain it.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	Simplest explanation I can come up with:<br>  <br>  According to Einstein there is no such thing as space & time. There is space-time. These are so linked they are really one thing. If you distort space like a black hole does, you automatically distort time to the same amount. As space is stretched to a near infinitely small point, time is slowed by the effect. The closer you get to the physical distortion, the slower time goes.<br>  <br>  As far as light goes. Everything is affected by gravity. Since we can't jump fast enough, we're always pulled back to Earth. Light "jumps" much faster, so Earth's gravity has little effect on it. A black hole, on the other hand, has so much gravity that light that gets too close is pulled in just like you are by the earth. Since nothing can go faster than light, and light isn't fast enough to escape, nothing can escape from inside the event horizon (point of no return) of a black hole.

AA11852174	Your best bet is to distill.<br>  <br>  By distilling, you can recover the water. Not the salt. That's what you want, right?<br>  <br>  Before distilling, though, filter for impurities if you see the need for it (if the water's obviously dirty). Then, heat a flask with the salt water covered with a rubber stopper, run a tube through the stopper to a beaker or your vessel of choice. That will separate the water from non-volatile solutes, like NaCl.<br>  <br>  For more specific instructions, try this:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillatio...</a><br>  <br>  Tip:<br>  Actually you can boil the sea water in any container and just cover it of you can't do this the laboratory way.

The one to the right of that picture would be the Side View.<br>  <br>  Theoretically, you could call any of those views the "Top View".  The 2 other views would then be based on whichever you name first.  i.e., you could call the bottom right picture the Top, the one to the right would then be the side, and the one above it would be the Front.<br>  <br>  Basic drawing standards usually have the Top View of an object at the top of the drawing.  The other views are usually laid out to the direction of the view that they are.  The one below the Top view is the side view, or the view from the side that would see by looking from the direction "down" from the Top view....etc.
wSRHWpItaa	The type of cell division is meiosis, which is a modified version of the regular cell division called mitosis. The first thing a cell does before it divides is to copy all its chromosomes. This leaves the cell with TWICE the normal number of chromosomes.

Bd16ixUQaa	The way you've presented the problem is a little hard to understand but i think I understand what you're asking: for each expression does it equal something even, something odd, or either even or odd depending what number you substitute in.<br>  <br>  Okay, here's what you do, for every variable you substitute in an even #, an odd #, the number 0, the number 1, (you have to do the last two becasue they have special properties, so sometimes they'll be an exception to the rule) and see what kind of number the answer is.<br>  <br>  So, for number 1, let p =0, p =1, p = 3 (arbitrary odd number), p = 4 (arbitrary even number)<br>  when p = 0 then p2 = 0 x 2 = 0 - even answer<br>  when p = 1 then p2 equals 1 x 2 = 2 - even answer<br>  when p = 3 then p 2 = 3 x 2 = 6 - even answer<br>  when p = 4 then p2 = 4 x 2 = 8 - even answer<br>  So, p2 is always even<br>  <br>  I'm going to skip to 4.<br>  for number 4, it's a bit more work because you have to try the different combinations (but remember if at any time you get one answer even and one odd, you can stop because you know the answer is either)<br>  so try to find short cuts<br>  if either p, q, or r equal 0 then since they are multiplied the product is 0 which makes it even, now the answer is, can pqr ever be odd?<br>  well:<br>  even x even = even -> ex 2 x 2 = 4<br>  even x odd = even -> ex 2 x 3 = 6<br>  odd x odd = odd -> ex 3 x 3 = 9<br>  <br>  So, for pqr we can have one of the following combinations <br>  (I'm going to use e for even number  and o for odd number)<br>  e x e x e<br>  e x e x o<br>  e x o x o<br>  o x o x o<br>  well, using our rules let's look at each one (remember we've already seen that when one of them is 0 the answer is even so if any one of these gives an odd answer, we know the answer is either if none of them gives an odd answer we know the ans is even)<br>  Now the only way to get an odd answer is if you have an odd times an odd, so we know the first one won't work.<br>  For e x e x o we end up with e x o which is e<br>  for e x o x o we get e x o which is e<br>  for o x o x o we get o x o which is o<br>  SO THE ANSWER IS EITHER<br>  <br>  Now for number two, we're going to do the same thing but first we have to have the even/odd addition rules which are<br>  e + e = e -> (2 + 2) = 4<br>  e + o = o -> 2 + 3 = 5<br>  o + o = e -> 3 + 5 + 8<br>  We already know the multiplication rules (that's why I did #4 first)<br>  so we do the same kind of thing.<br>  <br>  Number 3 is like number 1|`|0cc349e5b23bb03a0dcb7d4307ba36b0aa	If 'p' is odd then p^2 is odd   e.g. 5; 5^2 = 25<br>  If 'p' is even then p^2 is even  e.g.  6; 6^2 = 36<br>  <br>  Similarly for q^2 <br>  <br>  p(q+r)<br>  If p = even then term is even<br>  If 'q' or 'r' is odd then (q+r) is odd<br>  If 'q' and 'r' are odd or even  then (q+r) is even.<br>  If 'p' and (q+r) are both even then term is even <br>  If 'p' or (q+r) is odd then then term is even <br>  If 'p' and (q+r) are both odd then term is odd.<br>  <br>  pqr<br>  If 'p' or 'q' or 'r' is even then term is even <br>  If 'p' and 'q' and 'r' are odd then term is odd.|`|c68dd044c16b196244c1cf82d99509a2aa	Whit is it ????|`|fkq2uywUaa	p2 ..... 2 multiplied by anything (p) will always be even<br>  <br>  p(q+r)..chose any combination of odd and even numbers:<br>             - p, q and r even would give an even answer<br>             - mixture of odd and even give an odd answer<br>             - therefore either =]<br>  <br>  q2.......the same as p2<br>        .....unless you've been given numbers for p/q<br>  <br>  pqr......again chose different combinations:<br>             - p, q and r even would give even answer<br>             - p, q and r odd would give odd answer<br>             - therefore either<br>  <br>  ......i think! =) x|`|WVd2S6xWaa	welcome to first grade math

cCShIyWUaa	Genetic mutations always occur in cells. This is because DNA is housed within the cell nucleus|`|RTY5VahLaa	Mutations are changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA, and can  occur by one of three mechanisms:<br>  (1) Spontaneous mutations that occur during DNA replication.  The enzyme that replicates DNA (DNA polymerase) makes mistakes occasionally during DNA replication, inserting a T where there should be a G, for example.<br>  (2) Radiation-induced damage.  UV radiation can alter the way bases bond (pyrimidine nucleotides in particular), resulting in misreading of the bases involved during DNA replication<br>  (3) Chemical modifications of bases, like you see with tobacco smoke.  Substances in smoke modify functional groups on DNA bases, altering the way they base pair, resulting in misreading during DNA replication<br>  Hope that helps.|`|XLVRRtBaaa	Yeah, simple question.<br>  Your DNA is responsible to- act as a blueprint. The order of the bases in DNA determines what protein is synthesized. There are four bases. Take one base and change it with another base, you have mutation ( a point mutation). Rearange a few bases and you have a larger mutation. Now how will this mutation be displayed. Usually, it will not. The odds are that the mutation is in an area (a gene) that does not code for anything (see transcription/translation). Even if it was, there are safety mechanisms that would prevent this mutation from being transcribed. When the safety mechanism is disabled (by a mutation), the cell mutates. The cell divides and multiplies. It forms a blood supply. It becomes a tumor. Then it travels and spreads. It becomes a cancer.|`|LWsyxuMfaa	Mutations can be inherited. This means that if a parent has a mutation in his or her DNA, then the mutation is passed on to his or her children. <br>  OR<br>  Mutations can be acquired.

Since it is 5 or above (it is 6 in this example), you need to round up. Therefore, the 0 becomes a 1 and you have 6.1.|`|1e8f9a70b81ba191472efb5cd4e71038aa	6.1

FY4cCjsOaa	I'm using underscores (_) for spacing control below, because Y!A drops leading spaces on a line.    __2A3C  ____B7  ------------  _127A4  1D094  ------------  1E30E4    That's the answer (checked with a hex calculator). Digit by digit, let's go through it. When there aren't any digits in the range A-C, I'm using hexadecimal if I write it preceded by an 0x (the C language indicator), and decimal otherwise.    7*C = 7*12 = 84 = 0x54 (write 4, carry 5)  7*3+5 = 26 = 1A (write A, carry 1)  7*A+1 = 71 = 0x47 (write 7, carry 4)  7*2+4 = 18 = 0x12    This completes the 7*2A3C = 127A4 partial product.    B*C = 11*12 = 132 = 0x84 (write 4, carry 8)  B*3+8 = 11*3+8 = 41 = 0x29 (write 9, carry 2)  B*A+2 = 11*10+2 = 112 = 0x70 (write 0, carry 7)  B*2+7 = 11*2+7 = 29 = 1D    This completes the B[0]*2A3C = 1D094[0] partial product, where I'm noting the [0] digits to remind us this is in the 16s column.    Adding the partial products: 127A4 + 1D0940  4+0 = 4  A+4 = E  7+9 = 16 = 0x10 (write 0, carry 1)  2+0+1 = 3  1+D = E  1 = 1    Answer: 1E30E4

FY4cCjsOaa	There are 52! possible states of the shuffled deck.    If all four aces appear as consecutive cards in the deck, then there are 49 places they can appear (at the top, or after any one of the other 48 cards). For each of these positions, the other cards can appear in 48! different orders.    So the probability is  49 * 48! / 52! = 49! / 52!  = 1 / (52 * 51 * 50) = 1 / 132,600

6c2be2f9234ae63b1e07a17e279442ceaa	There are 3 time periods. The boat passed the log at the end of t1. A key point to note, and use, is that the time from the first sighting of the log to the second sighting is the same for the boat and for the log.  Ttotal = t1 + t2 + t3  where t1 is the time it took the boat to go the first 1.04 km, t2 is the time from the first log sighting to the boat's most upstream point, and t3 is the time from the boat's most upstream point to the return to the starting point. We know that t2=56.4 min.    The boat's water speed is   Vb = 1.04 km / t1 so   t1 = 1.04 km / vb    We can get vb from the given info about time period t2.  vb = 1.38 km / 56.4 min = .0245 km/min  That's answer  3.  So we can get t1  t1 = 1.04 km / .0245 km/min = 42.5 min    By the start of time period t3, the boat is   1.04 km + 1.38 km = 2.42 km upstream from the starting point.    The log's travel time, t2+t3, is  t2+t3 = 1.04 km / vr  We also know that  t2+t3 = 2.42 km / vb = 2.42 km / (.0245 km/min) = 98.8 min That's answer  1.    And you can get answer  2 from   t2+t3 = 1.04 km / vr

Second, the physics of such a question would depend of numerous factors...the most important of which is inertia. The following are all factors in determining if a nuclear explosion could deflect an incoming asteroid:    Size of the asteroid  Velocity of the asteroid  Mass of the asteroid  Shape of the asteroid  Angle of the asteroid toward earth  Power of the explosion  Location of the explosion in relation to the asteroid  Distance from earth the explosion takes places  Any many other smaller factors that will have some effects, albeit small ones.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	You wouldn't get much of a concussion, but the energy of the blast hitting the asteroid would ablate some material and give it a nudge.    If that nudge were given a sufficently long time before impact, the very small velocity delta imparted would be enough to cause it to miss.|`|ViZH5twNaa	Most likely not. Any sort of asteroid large enough to need deflecting would take a LOT of energy to move. A nuke may be devastating on Earth, but in space a lot of energy is blasted off in unneeded directions.    One nuke probably wouldn't cut it. Many nukes might have a chance, but only if they were detonated while the asteroid was far off. If we move it even a little while it is still very far away that deviation will get larger and larger over time, hopefully enough to miss Earth. If we attempted to deviate the asteroid while it is relatively close to Earth we would have to use a lot more nukes because we have to deviate it even more since there is no time for a small change to grow.    There is also the risk of destroying the asteroid which despite the common belief that that is what should be done it is actually one of the worst things we could do. By destroying the asteroid you turn one larger asteroid of doom that will hit only one spot on Earth into many many smaller asteroids of doom that will carpet bomb the entire planet. So long as all the debris that made up the original asteroid still makes it to Earth the exact same amount of energy gets released (which is a lot of energy, which is bad).|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	There would be no serious blast of the nuke, but most energy would be emitted as radiation. This radiation would be able to vaporize a part of the asteroid and this vaporization could propel the asteroid... but not much. Most of the energy of the nuke and the vaporization would be undirected, so you would need a huge nuke for even a small effect.     Even worse, it depends on how the asteroid absorbs the radiation. if the shock wave caused by the heating goes the wrong way, it can break the asteroid apart and the energy would be used for overcoming the binding forces of the asteroid, than deflecting the asteroid, creating a shotgun effect.|`|lhYIk8b2aa	It may well do, but it would depend on the distance from earth, the velocity relative to earth, the size of the nuke, how close the explosion was to the asteroid etc.    If you're asking if it is likely too, then probably not.

The equation of the line through (0,0) that is perpendicular to x cos  + y sin  = p is just x tan , and the intersection is at (p cos , p sin ). Using Pythagorean, we know that the square of the radius of the new circle is a2 - ((p cos )2 +(p sin )2), or just a2 - p2. Thus, the equation of the new circle is     (x - p cos )2 + (y - p sin )2 + a2 - p2 = 0    which, when expanded and rearranged, will get you the answer you seek

So, two values of x also gives two values of y, proving it intersects at 2 distinct points, i.e. option (ii).    (b) doing teh same again, -2x-1 = 7x^2 -7x => 7x^2 -5x +1 = 0  solving this eqn. gives unreal values of x, i.e. discriminant is less than zero.  so, there are no real points of intersection of the line and curve in this case, so it is option (iii)    (c) doing the same again, 3x + 9 = 9x^2 - 3x + 10 => 9x^2 -6x +1 = 0  solving this eqn. will give us real and equal roots, i.e discriminant is zero and  x = 1/3 therefore, puttin value of x in y = 3x + 9, we get y = 10.

j7Hm9W8Jaa	Assuming all of the carbon dioxide (CO2) being released into the atmosphere was created from free oxygen in the air (O2) and carbon atoms from elsewhere (hydrocarbon fuel being burned):    Then as the O2 molecules (which have a mass of 32) are taken from the air to be burned and turned into CO2 (mass of CO2 = 48), the O2 in the atmosphere decreases by 32 for every CO2 molecule created.    So the ratio of mass for CO2 : O2 is 48:32,  simplified is: 3:2    The question is a little too vague to try to go much further than that.

Fmo4ZgYjaa	Hello hai    We need to break the problem into two pieces, before the engine quits and after the engine quits.    For the time before the engine quits, use this equation.      y = y0 + V0*t + (1/2) * a * t^2    No, that one is too hard, lets use this one to find Vf  first,  then find the time that the engine quits.  We will need Vf later, I am sure.    Vf^2 = Vi^2 + 2 * a * (y-y0)    y-y0 = 1000m  y = 1000 m  y0 = 0 m  V0 = 80 m/s   a = 4.0m/s^2    Vf = sqrt(Vi^2 + 2 * a * (y-y0))    Vf = sqrt((80 m/s)^2 + 2 * (2.00 m/s^2 * (1000 m))    Vf = 102 m/s    Now, for time    Vf = Vi + a * t    t = (Vf - Vi) / a    t = (102 m/s - 80 m/s) / (2.00 m/s^2)    t = 11 sec (this is just time to where the engine quits)    Now for the second half, after the engine quits, it is still going up at 102 m/s.    Vi = 102 m/s   a = g = -9.81 m/s^2  y0 = 1000 m  y=0m    Again, it is easier to calculate the final velocity, then the time.  Otherwise you have a polynomial to solve.    Vf^2 = Vi^2 + 2 * a * (y-y0)    Vf = sqrt(Vi^2 + 2 * a * (y-y0))    Vf = sqrt((102 m/s)^2 + 2 * (-9.80 m/s^2) * (0 m - 1000 m))    Vf =  -140.4m/s    Now for the time after the engine quit.    Vf = Vi + a * t    t = (Vf - Vi) / a    t = (-140.4 m/s - 102 m/s) / -9.80m/s^2    t = 24.73 sec after engine quit.    Total time = time before engine quit and time after engine quit.    total time = 11 sec + 24.73 sec    Total Time = 35.73 sec.    B) for max altitude, start right after the engine quit    Vi = 102 m/s  Vf = 0 m/s  a = g = -9.8 m/s^2  y0 = 1000 m    Vf^2 = Vi^2 + 2 * a * (y-y0)    Vf^2 - Vi^2 = 2 * a * (y-y0)    (y-y0) = (Vf^2 - Vi^2) / 2 * a    y = ((Vf^2 - Vi^2) / 2 * a) +y0    y = [((0 m/s^2 - 102 m/s^2) / 2 * (-9.8m/s^2)] +1000 m    y = 1531 m    c)  Already solved for this in part a)    Vf =  -140.4m/s    Good Luck

DRVSCxKpaa	The signs of the zodiac are those 'constellations' (geometric pattern of stars) that lie along the line of the ecliptic (the path the sun takes across the sky).  The ecliptic is actually the plane of the earth's orbit around the sun, which is tilted at 23 degrees to the earth's axis.  Because the stars are very far away' compared to the earth's annual orbit around the sun, they look the same throughout the year.  And of course, the earth rotates on its axis every day, so the signs of the zodiac appear to rotate around the earth every twenty four hours (but of course' we don't see those that are above the horizon during the daytime.<br>  So no. we don't 'see' the constellations as they go around the sun; but we see the constellations as the earth rotates.<br>  <br>  There are many other constellations as well as the signs of the zodiac.  In the Northern hemisphere, you will see Orion, the big dipper and Scorpio; which are all easy to see, but i don't know which are visible right now..  <br>  The actual signs of the zodiac are hard to work out; as it takes quite a bit of imagination to interpret the star patterns as the ancient astronomers did.<br>  Here is a reference to the signs of the zodiac; but look up 'ecliptic' in as well, for a good explanation.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac</a>|`|7sXNwFynaa	very good q.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	In 1920 the International Astronomical Union defined the boundaries of 88 official constellations. These include the traditional 12 zodiac constellations, although a 13th constellation, Ophiuchus, occupies a fair length of the ecliptic (the solar system's equator). You're correct that we can see most of these 13 constellations most of the time, except for the two or three close to the current position of the Sun. At the moment, the Sun is in Aquarius, so the constellations Pisces, Aquarius, and Capricornus are all hidden by the Sun's light. The constellations opposite these three are the ones most readily visible around midnight at the present time: Cancer, Leo, and Virgo. As the Earth moves around the Sun, the Sun appears to move through these ecliptic constellations at one constellation per month.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	The twelve signs of the zodiac are all arranged around the ecliptic: the imaginary line along which the Sun and planets appear to move. <br>  <br>  Right now Pisces, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer are up in the early evening, followed by Leo, Libra, Scorpius and finally Sagittarius just before dawn.<br>  <br>  An interesting tidbit: The ancient Greeks astrologers only recognized 11 constellations.  The Romans placed more emphasis on Jupiter, which orbits in 12 years, so they thought that there needed to be a 12th constellation.  The two Easternmost stars in Libra were actually the claws of Scorpius, but the Romans figuratively chopped them off to make Libra.

This means that the net forces (F? - friction, no acceleration) are zero. If the force applied by the worker is greater, the net forces will be greater than zero, and the crate will accelerate (that is, its speed will increase as long as there is a greater force F? applied.<br>  <br>  (c) From the discussion in part (b), it can be inferred that a force less than F? would mean that the crate would not move. The force of static friction between the crate and the floor would then be larger than F?.<br>  <br>  Any time a problem says constant speed, it is code for zero acceleration and a balance of forces on the object of interest.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
9v31wUz1aa	The background reading is fairly constant ( allowing for the random activity of course - which is why you need to take the average of several readings). When measuring anyother radioactivity this is always over and above the background - so this must be taken away from the final reading to obtain just the activity you are trying to measure.|`|ozyhLhOpaa	You have to measure background radiation. you measure that then measure the object you want to measure. Take away the background reading and that gives you the true value from your object.<br>  If you dont take the background reading your results will always be too high

qSPXZ6miaa	ok to do this question you need to note that <br>  <br>  (1+s)^1/2/(1-s)^1/2 <br>  <br>  is equal to <br>  <br>  ((1+s)^1/2)*((1+s)^1/2) / ((1-s)^1/2)*((1+s)^1/2) <br>  <br>  which is equal to <br>  <br>  1+s/(1-s^2)^1/2<br>  <br>  which is equal to <br>  <br>  1/(1-s^2)^1/2 + s/(1-s^2)^1/2<br>  <br>  It is then possible to integrate these two expressions separately. The first is a standard integral and integrates to arcsin(s) (the inverse sine of s) and the second can be done by inspection noting that the expression is of the form c(f '(x))/(f (x))^1/2, where c is a constant in this case equal to -1, which integrates to c(f (x))^1/2 or specifically in this case to -(1-s^2)^1/2. I assume that evaluating the limits will be no problem for you.

Often found under "Start→Programs→Accessories→System Tools" , it can also be accessed by "Start→Run" and then typing "charmap".  (XP and earlier-I'm not sure about Vista)  I keep a shortcut to "charmap" on my desktop for just this purpose. (Right click on desktop, select "New shortcut", and enter "charmap" in the location box) <br>  <br>  Many characters are also available using "Alt codes"  Holding down the Alt key and entering a code on the keypad will produce certain symbols, although you'll need to memorize them.  See <a href="http://www.theworldofstuff.com/characters/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theworldofstuff.com/character...</a> for examples.<br>  <br>  I agree however that YA should include some sort of   equation editor if they expect quality answers in Mathematics.  Not all characters are available in all type fonts, and depending on your browser and the character encoding selected therein, some characters might appear as a square box rather than what they should be.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Again, here's where the type font comes in.  Under character map, try choosing Lucida Sans Unicode.  This font contains many more symbols than Times New Roman for instance.  ?, ?, ?, ? are some of the set symbols available, as well as many others, but as I indicated, you may not be able to view these even now depending on your browser and its settings.<br>  <br>  p.s. I've contacted YA about their text editor drawbacks in the past, with no response.  (There's also the issue about long strings being abbreviated and an ellipsis added.  This requires that long numbers or equations include spaces somewhere within a certain limit in order that the entirety of it be seen.  i.e., 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419...<br>  must be written:<br>  3.141592653589793238462643383279502884 197169399375105820974944592307816406286  , where a space is added after ...884)  But I'm sure that the more people that raise the issue the likelier they will do something about it.

As you can clearly see if you have a look at any of my Answers.<br>  <br>  It is tiresome to an extent, but far less time consuming then typing the maths out explicitly.<br>  <br>  Hopefully Y!A will get their act together and either implement a basic Java Applet with Maths Symbols (as you suggested) and or enable the compilation of tex code.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  David

In this case add -(5/9)2 to both sides of the equation:<br>  x2- (10x)/(9) + (25)/(81) = -(7)/(9) + (25)/(81)<br>  <br>  Now add fractions by making the denominators equal.

Think of the number line- by dividing by a negative number and flipping the sign, you are essentially flipping the sign to point a different way.

AA11915874	use the boiling point elevation equation...<br>  <br>  dT = Kb x m x i<br>  <br>  dT = elevated bp - normal bp = 81.15C - 80.10C = 1.05C<br>  Kb = 2.53C/m<br>  m = molality of solution = moles solute / kg solvent<br>  i = van't hoff factor = # ions in solution / molecule of solute = 1 for an undissociated solute.<br>  <br>  m = dT / Kb x i = 1.05C / (2.53C/m x 1) = 0.415 molal<br>  <br>  ***************<br>  so now we know molality... how do we find mole fraction?  well mole fraction = moles of one species / total moles.   so let's assume we have 1 kg of solvent...benzene...  we know molality = .415 moles napthalene / 1 kg benzene right?.. so <br>  <br>  1 kg benzene x (0.415 moles napthalene / 1 kg benzene) = 0.415 moles napthalene<br>  <br>  and 1 kg benzene x (1000 g / 1 kg) x (1 mole / 78.11g) = 12.80 moles benzene<br>  <br>  so total moles = 12.80 + 0.415 = 13.22 moles<br>  and<br>  mole fraction napthalene = 0.415 moles / 13.22 moles = 0.0313

AA10439008	Degree of a polynomial = the highest degree of any of its terms, and the degree of a term = the sum of the exponents of its variables, so you have 4x^5y^7 and 5+7 = 12, so degree = 12<br>  <br>  2x^2y only has degree 3; 14xy has degree 2 and 3 has degree 0; 12 is highest
