At school me and my friends always bring our ipods to listen to in the morning. We do this like every morning. And me and my friend Bre were listening to mine. Then my other friend kaish wanted me to listen to something on hers. So I let Bre listen to something on mine by herself. We were soon dismissed to our lockers. Bre still had my ipod and we were goofing around. I was like c'mon give it back. And she was like no this is my song haha! So i just started talking to Kaish. We get to our lockers and i had completely forgotten all about it. After school i was gonna listen to it also. So i reached inside my back pack only to find that it wasnt there. I started talking to Kaish about it and she said that Bre still had it when she went to her locker. I was just like okay thanx. So i texted Bre and was like gimme my ipod back silly! And she immediately texted back i dont have it. I thot she was just messing around so i kept asking her. She was like dude i dont have it i swear. I was like where is it then? She said uhm i put it in your locker when you werent looking. I immeadiately knew that wasn't true because in the morning before i go to my locker i help my t.a. teacher with grading some papers and things like that. So i usually dont get my locker open by the beggining of 1st period when no1! and i mean no1 is out in the lockerbay! If so i would have heard someone come up near my locker. The next morning i got Bre and i was like alright then show me where you put it. She looked at my locker and said i put it right here on the top shelf. And i was like well its not there. She was like thats your problem. then walked off. Thanks for listening to this kinda long story! If you could please help me figure out what i might be able to do! Im afraid to tell my mom because she is going to ground me for life! This happened on wednesday by the way. Thanks again! Please answer:]

I have U.S. cellular cuz of my parents work pays for it so don't tell me to switch carriers please. I am getting a new phone and I am wondering weather I should get the Samsung Delve, the Motorola Hint QA 30, or LG UX260(Rumor/Scoop). I think it would be cool to have a touchscreen phone like the Delve but I am afraid that the touchscreen won't be responsive after a couple months and I will be stuck with it for two years becuase my parents won't let me get a new phone between contracts. I like to text though so I am not sure it txting is hard on a touchscreen phone, or if Hint or Rumor would be better because they have actual buttons. I know that the Rumor is rumored to not be so great so it is really between the Delve and the Hint. Wich is better, and will the Delve wear down? Is the Hint hard to text on? Again, please don't tell me to switch to at&t or Sprint or wherever because I have to be with U.S. Cellular. I like texitng and the delve has an electronic full keyboard and the hint also has qwerty keyboard. Also, I don't want a blackberry or any smartphone for that matter. Thanks in advance and I am sorry this is so long!

Problem is now its come to upgrading i am being told its a 24 month contract, unfortunatly i have thrown all paperwork away as i have been with vodafone several years and never thought something like this would happen. After much persuasion the person on the phone agreed that if the phone call from earlier on in the week was listened to by the help team and they heard the conversation thatmy phone was due for upgrade and i needed to phone on the 21st to sort it all out, they would honour it and allow me to upgrade. However the help team havent listened to it and have said there is nothing we can do. But what should i do as there is no way i agreed to a 24 month contract and there is no way i am keeping the phone for a futher 6 months. Please help.

I understand that a SIM card is a way of my 'phone company checks that the phone with the SIM card in it is authorised to use the network and to identify my calls.       I know that if I don't pay my 'phone bill the phone company can "zap" my SIM card. That will stop my phone working.       I am not very good at electronics but I have an enquiring mind and it is bugging me that I can't work out the way the phone company can stop a SIM card working without them physically having access to it. I can't see how they can physically damage the card in my phone by sending some magic signal through the airwaves so how do they "zap" the card?  (Please keep the answers simple but explain the technology involved.)

But I dropped it today and when I tried listing to music all I hear is the background music & almost no vocals...it's so faded that you have to turn the music up to full max to hear the words on quiet mode. When I have headphones in it if I push them from the back as hard as I can upwards then it goes back to normal, but if I loosen my grip or let go then it goes back to quiet mode. I also have to adjust the headphones to get it right so when I push the back it will work. I have tried restarting it (hitting the menu & center button) and have also re-synced it, but nothing has worked.

20090222151306AARMnwx	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	How to unlock an AT&T Samsung A727 phone for use on T-Mobile?	My old phone broke so my buddy gave me one of his older phones to use. The problem is that my service provider is T-Mobile and the phone he gave me has a network lock under AT&T so I've been trying to figure out how to unlock it. I googled the topic and found a few pay sites online but I decided that I would rather do it in person than over the internet so I visited a few stores. Unfortunately the people at the stores could only offer to try and unlock it, while making me leave the phone overnight and charging a much higher price than online...so I started thinking that maybe all they do is look it up online and then charge you extra money for doing it.      Bottom Line: I figure it would be cheaper and better overall to do it through the internet unless I can find a free way to do it.      So, does anybody know of a free way to do it? If not, does anybody know a specific site online that is cheap, fast, and effective?
