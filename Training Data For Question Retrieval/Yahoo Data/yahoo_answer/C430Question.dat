To tell you the truth, this economy hasn't affected my family at all really.  But doesn't mean we are living the high life.  We are just the average middle class family that you know, has to watch their spending.      But anyway.  I really want my family to start saving up money.  Because I'm so sick of hearing "We don't have enough for this or that" when they spend way too much on stuff.      What are ways we can save money?  Through buying and home?      So far, my family has gotten rid of calling features on our phone, bought a new car that we pay somewhat less, limited our grocery bill, and some other stuff.  But I don't think it's helping that much.      I'm making my parents use coupons when they go shopping now and buy stuff that there's a coupon with.  Like instead of Brawny, we get like Bounty because you save a dollar with it.        So what are other ways we can save money?

I had seen one in my neighbor's yard, but I think it is getting under my fence and into my yard.  Maybe it is living under my deck, or among the roots of one of my pine trees.   It would not bother me, as I don't garden, but I noticed that the rabbit has been teething on one of my deck posts.  It's really noticeable, and has exposed the inside of the wood ( I originally thought it was termites, but I looked closer and saw toothmarks).   It has only been in the last 48 hours that I've seen the teething marks.   How do I get rid of the rabbit?   Also, to protect my deck, can I spray something on the wood to make it less tasty for the rabbit?      any help would be appreciated.  Thank you.

It's about 15 degrees warmer than the first floor because the duct work wasn't replaced when we got our air conditioner. So I was wondering how much it would cost to have the ducts replaced.       Just on the chance that it is outrageously expensive, what are some other ways to cool down a house in the summer time? Please don't suggest using fans because they dont work.
20090307131756AAlFfb3	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Saving on the electric bill...dryer and microwave...?	A few weeks ago i asked a question about way of saving on the electric bills, now i have another one. Our electric bill use to be included in with the rent at out old place, we would just pay an automatic $100 so we were never caution on how we used the electricity. Now we'll be paying our own bill and have been very caution. We already leave the blender, toaster, lamps, and chargers unplugged if we're not using them. Ive heard that the dryer uses the most electricity and i have very easy access to simply unplug it when not in use. Since i'll only be doing laundry 2 times a week (before i did it whenever about everyday) will i really save a few bucks if i just unplug the dryer for the days i don't use it? I don't care about the time on the microwave either because the stove is right next to it, what about unplugging the microwave too?      I ask because of this article i just read:  http://green.yahoo.com/blog/the_consciou...
