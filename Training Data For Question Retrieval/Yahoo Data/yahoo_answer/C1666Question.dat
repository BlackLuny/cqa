I know the ideal time would probably be in march-april - but thats when all the schools are on break and everyones traveling.

20090129063407AAq4y96	Travel;Canada;Other - Canada	In Canada, are doctor check-ups free of charge?	I have a fever and sore throat and I think Bronchitus. I know since I'm a USA citizen, I'm not entitled to Canadian healthcare, but if I were Canadian, I'd be able to see the doctor without paying beyond taxes, right?    In the USA, I have a heath insurance plan but it has a deductible so the first visit is $330.00 and then after that the insurance finally kicks in.  Plus the insurance charges most people $200.00 per month.     For headache, fevers, sore throats, would the quality of care for what you pay be more reasonable in your opinion in Canada than USA?  Do Canadians have to pay per visit also?

20090129062918AA61gh4	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	Why do the Protocols of the Zionists are so acurate about Israel?	I was reading them  http://mailstar.net/protocol.html  (It's a genuine copy, uploaded by an Australian Christian Catholic priest, in fact)  Here is a part of the 1st Protocol:    "Our State, marching along the path of peaceful conquest, has the right to replace the horrors of war by less noticeable and more satisfactory sentences of death, necessary to maintain the terror which tends to produce blind submission. Just but merciless severity is the greatest factor of strength in the State: not only for the sake of gain but also in the name of duty, for the sake of victory, we must keep to the programme of violence and make-believe. The doctrine of squaring accounts is precisely as strong as the means of which it makes use. Therefore it is not so much by the means themselves as by the doctrine of severity that we shall triumph and bring all governments into subjection to our super-government. It is enough for them to know that we are merciless for all disobedience to cease."    If you read closely you will discover that almost 99% coincides with today's Israel.    Who wrote these Protocols?  Just don't tell me they are fake. If you take the time to read through them you'll see that they are not.  Cheers

Also, what's a good area to live in? Since we both are going to different colleges.
20090129071402AAuMVyf	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Lebanon	What on earth is up with Lebanese parents?	My girlfriend of 3 years is from Lebanon, and we met 4 years ago, when she came to the US for being accepted in one of the colleges there.       She means the world to me, and everything went extremely fine the whole time she was staying here. When she was through with college, she said she was going to go back to Lebanon to visit/see her parents.       We both knew it was going to be a bit hard on the both of us, since we were used to seeing each other every day and all, but I could understand her, since she also missed her parents, and she was going to come back to the US a week later. She even found a great job here in the US.       The thing is, once she got to Lebanon, her parents wouldn't let her come back. She says it was because she told them about me. Apparently, they are not ok with me being 'only' 3 months older than her.. they said she should be dating someone at least 7 years older, which I think is very weird.       The funny part was, they didn't want her to go back to the US and actually work, and they really seemed to not like the fact that I was still in college while she finished. It's not my fault majoring in Medecine takes that much time.    Now I have to listen to her cry on the phone everyday, because her parents are being too stubborn, having my heart ripped out each time, as there is nothing I can think of that can actually change this situation. She says she doesn't want to 'disobey' her parents, yet she wishes she never got back to Lebanon. Having them control her life seems to be fine with both of them though. I don't get it. And she says... most Lebanese parents are of the same mentality. Seriously, what's up with that?

I'm trying to relocate, but I know it's hard to meet people being new to an area. Henderson is more of a suburb, but is very beautiful and close to the strip. Center City Philly is also nice, but what you get for the money is definately not close to Nevada. On the other hand I think it would be easier to make friends in an urban city. I really like Nevada though. Is there much to do for a young professional besides the casinos?

20090129075200AAe6mAc	Travel;Asia Pacific;China	China abuses usa on currency crimes issue again.why don't china realizes it?	Attack those you need most and attempt to imbue them with unearned guilt! We've seen this game before, Mr. Commie-Thug Dictator; or shall we call you Mr. Wen?      Chinese Premier Wen Jiaboa took to the Davos stage yesterday to attack the US and the West; it borders on comical. But sadly, the elite gathered at Davos are foolish enough to lap it up like the simpering capitalist dogs Mr. Wen believes they represent, and for the most part he is probably right.      It is too fresh that Mr. Wen attacks the system that has helped his country pull millions from poverty and allowed for the transition of the Commies to represent a new happy face to the world even though their underlying intention of complete control of everything they touch, no matter how they must cheat and steal to achieve this goal, has never changed.      This proves Chinese disrespect to world and west again.It proves enough china is only about violating human right and creating financial crisis in world.hat has changed is the degree to which the Western business elites have been duped into thinking this is a regime they can really do business with. Which goes to the rotting core of the leadership of our multinational companies and political elites in the West; again Mr. Wen exploits this well. Think of the big hedge fund investments of the former politicos who along with the first-tier Western multinationals who hold vast Chinese asset investments. It is very much in their interest to pretend dealing with China is free trade. Interesting this same crowd represents the major funding for "think" tanks that get so much press and ink in order to spout the mantra of "free trade." Lies flow from both sides - indeed.      If the dictator commie thug wasn't so busy making sure any real dissent in his own country was stifled and the proper threats to the state dealt with, maybe he and his gang would have provided more domestic choices for his own people with all their wealth gained from dealing with the system he now supposedly finds so repugnant.      My musing on a bit of Wen self-dialogue; it might go something like this:      Heck, if we create a real domestic market it might increase citizens' political power; we can't have that ... well, not yet.      We just don't quite have enough internet monitoring equipment and software from Cisco, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Google (and other assorted tier-one western companies) to control 100%--but those dupes keep upgrading our ability to electronically enslave our people, so soon we can create a domestic market with Chinese "character."      But since we are not there yet, let's continue to play the export model game that has enriched us so well. You know the game: invite all the Western companies in to produce in China. We make it a quid pro quo - in order to gain access to our vast consumer market we make those greedy dupes produce here and transfer technology to us. We treat them pretty good and gain access to hundreds of billions worth of technology funded by Western shareholders. And of course we outright steal the gold teeth from all the second- and third-tier manufacturers we invite into the country. Those clowns don't have well-funded think tanks to tell their story. No, instead those think tank dupes will continue to spout the mantra of "free trade" as we steal technology and jobs and hollow out Western manufacturing to boot. Gosh this is too easy. Wen's call for global action should be seen for what it is: China has milked the export model for years (granted low cost final goods have benefited to a degree, but recycling excess reserves is what created the asset bubbles and led Mr. Consumer to over indebtedness - it was not the other way around) and it is now crashing before their eyes; they've stolen Western technology for years to boost export prowess; they have suppressed their currency for years to make its final goods even cheaper in order to keep the export machine humming; and we all know China's enrichment was built on the backs of the blue collar workers in all industrialized nations. We have allowed for the hollowing out Western manufacturing so the power elites and the heads of our multinationals can enrich themselves through China.

My fiance and i are getting married this coming November and we've decided that we want to go to Jamaica but are having trouble choosing a resort.       I hear that Sandals is more of a party atmosphere with lots of activities and couples is more relaxed.  the problem is that we are kind of a mix between the two.  During the day we'd like to be alone on the beach (or at least have some breathing room, not crowded with a bunch of other people), with a choice of activities if we feel so inclined.  Outside trips are a plus as I love the Jamaican culture, especially the music!      but we are both in our late 20's and at night we love to party, so we want a place that has entertainment and bars that stay open late too.  Is there a resort in Jamaica (any location) that combines these two aspects of our personalities?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

So I am going to Peru this summer for the month of August and am looking for a well established organization that accepts volunteers.  I am looking for organizations that can teach me Spanish, supplies housing/meals and volunteering experience. Price is important so not too expensive but more importantly it should be functional. I have been looking for organizations on the internet for the past few months but am not sure which websites are giving accurate information. Real asholes like BARCOVAGO...yeah you know who im talking about,thinks that everyone who wants to travel is wealthy and Caucasian... well i am neither... so i know this may ruin my chances on getting responses but im having a bit of a hard time finding a place to stay in Peru so I was hoping to find people who have had hands on experience or know of someone who has volunteered in Peru. Does anyone know of any organizations in Peru that meet these standards?
