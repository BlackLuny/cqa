I love my flexible guy, but it depends per guy too... if he's ugly, flexible and mean. HELL NO!!! But if he's cute/sexy, flexible, and nice... That's a good catch. See what I'm saying? Its an asset without guys knowing it!|`|7kga2aRBaa	dont careee|`|YsYq7BJzaa	yea most of the time it means they can dance so yea its cool.
yLVYvmnuaa	she's a freshman? she would probably be honored to date you  you really shouldn't be shy. Go up to her and make up some excuse. like "Hey, you dropped something" if she dropped something or forgot something somewhere say "I found your ____ book in the hall" hahaha i know it's totally corny. But it does work, it starts up a conversation. Or you could say "how do u like the class?" or just small talk you know. If it's just in the hallway eye f***ing then go up to her and ask her a common question. Then just keep the conversation up and in a couple weeks when Friday comes ask her what she's doing. Invite her somewhere. she'd like that.|`|WFP46Ek9aa	what happend?  did i scare you when i said you can call me?|`|srfZDygNaa	if your a junior and shes a freshman, then you should NOT be intimidated. go for it :)
64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	well high school guys are all raging Testosterone so that isn't going to change until you are out of college. but sometimes you can find a guy that sex isn't all they think about. but each guys wants are different from the next, good luck on your search.|`|COmp4sIuaa	I'm the guy you're missing in your life.    Too bad we met on the internety, eh?|`|dIma3KxIaa	they want sexxxxxxxxxx but for the bright side guys dont take mean girls seriously|`|Z3RFbUrDaa	you said it yourself: guys want sex.|`|iJrCZxy8aa	ok im 16, and i can tell you that high school guys suck. Atleast in North America, all they want is SEX. I mean the girls are stupid here bcuz they just give it to them. The guys dont know how to treat a lady, i mean even if your going after sex, be charming like the italians. They know how to treat a lady, so ive heard. hahahaha. :)
enEvZqPBaa	guys think your ugly because the girls think your cute.  jealous.    but why do you care wat the other guys think?|`|WKA2iFKTaa	unless your gay you shouldn't care what the guy's think  of you .duh lol!!!!|`|Ux0spiIXaa	well if your straight... who cares?|`|COmp4sIuaa	Jealous.|`|E9rtmmNaaa	they're jealous maybe.
jEujQlsOaa	If you really have strong feelings for her and want her back you need to step back a little and try to observe your actions and the actions that you plan to take. It is a very emotional time for both of you but the best thing for you to do is to try and go about this in an objective way with the goal of getting together as the final outcome. It may take some time and some planning.    I will quote something that I recently wrote here "Learning not to do the wrong things and react emotionally is the hardest and most important lesson. That only sends the other person flying away as fast as they can. This totally goes against everything learned from childhood, sad, but true."    I wrote an article about this on my website. There are some good sources online that can help you reach your goal. And it never hurts to get advice from experienced people. Check my resources.   The magic of Making Up is one of them.|`|Ksilu2Zyaa	yes fool...........tell her how you feal.....its your responsibility as the man to makes things happen.|`|XbsuY1ogaa	Maybe she's trying really hard to get over you and you've thrown a monkey wrench at her.|`|5x57b46Qaa	wow dude you should comfort her, or like talk to her. dont let it be akward the next time you see her. be funny and just like ask around that and then just ask it. ask her if she loves you still. good luck|`|mOBDEBDZaa	she might, but i think it is just because she is not used to you guys not being together yet. also, when a guy says something like that to a girl, they normally get teary eyed. that is so sweet, and most guys don't take the time to say something like that to girls.|`|MqoQiLcuaa	Either shes trying to move on and you made it difficult or she didn't know you cared that much in the first place. Try talking to her in person and letting her know why you want to be together instead of just saying that you miss her. I miss my dog sometimes, but i can't live with out my .... kinda deal.
sebhK7r7aa	I'm 15 and never had a girlfriend before, or kissed. It's ok, just wait until the right person comes in your life. The longer you wait to get in a relationship, generally the better it is.|`|XhpLwjCuaa	Your young, guys your age may be uncomfortable asking you since they are new to the experience too. My suggestion would be to ask a guy you like. Yes rejection sucks but not trying sucks more. Also your a bit young dating at that age is 2 weeks to 3 months long so expect heart breaks but know you will always find someone new.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	A I am 18 years old and never had a gf so I don't see what the big deal is.|`|fZY8EkVDaa	Umm there are plenty of people that didn't get their kiss yet at that age. Don't worry!!! Good thinks come to girls who wait :) Dating under the age of like 16 is pointless and really imiture...|`|I8e21Hwoaa	haha be patient and dont try too hard!!! the harder you try the harder you fail...|`|HCWkdk4naa	do not worry.  this is normal and healthy.  girls your age with boyfriends are putting themselves at risk for an unhappy adult life.  you DO NOT want to be a teenage mother!  just enjoy your youth!  my aunt didn't get married until she was 38 and she has an awesome life and tons of money.|`|U12GVF7Kaa	could be your additude|`|t043WEDIaa	you have plenty of time for boyfriends...enjoy this time with your friends. and there's nothing wrong with you, but a lot of the guys in your grade probs aren't ready for that and would make crappy boyfriends anyways|`|MYbRICxqaa	Take your time and just wait. When it is time it will come. I hope my niece doesn't start thinking like this.|`|cc3bc74da528c9ab08e77b61000dc40faa	QUIT ACTING LIKE A DESPERATE CHILD.  desperation is not becoming and neither is whining.|`|IOIG1I9Saa	maybe it is not the right time for you. the right man will come, don't worry? don't act like it's the end of the world if you have no boyfriend at your age, because your still young. you got a whole future ahead of you.|`|GmTMVmASaa	you may not like this, but save your self the heartache and wait. i didn't get one til i was 15 and here i am an old lady now.|`|mOxVL0luaa	girl girl girl lolz |`|9WHtStZNaa	Okay, let me just tell you, its not the end of the world that you don't have a boyfriend. You are probably attractive in a sense that boys your age can't understand. At your age boys only care about being dumbasses and getting laid, which is hilarious because most of em can't handle being kissed. Now, let me tell you, I didn't get my first kiss till I turned 16 and even though it was a long time, in the end I got to avoid all the horror stories of the guys that miss your mouth and get your eye or slobber all over your face. Chill out, enjoy your friends and let the boys mature a bit before you hit the panic button. |`|pwSKT2Aeaa	relaxxxx, you dont need a bf or youre first kiss, just wait and when the time comes, youll be ready, dont rush into things|`|DUPOEk1daa	Be patient.  There is nothing wrong with you or anyone else who hasn't dated you or kissed you.    I think you're too young anyway.|`|5fjbNeVNaa	Give it some time. No one said you were ugly. but you are young. You have a long time to get a gf...lol.    Chill out and wait. Your only 13|`|7kga2aRBaa	its not a big deal haha!  i didnt have my first kiss till 14, and im 15 and still havnt had a boyfriendd and im not ugly either i just never like the guys that like mee|`|Z3RFbUrDaa	good lord, i'm 16 and haven't had one. calm down, and enjoy your childhood.|`|cmdAsz2iaa	aww sweetheart. :( You will get a boyfriend. The best things in life are never planned so stop planning. Trust me, when it happens it will be great. You're only 14. you have an entire life ahead of you. I'm 23 and am single dear so don't worry.|`|oNhIoVLIaa	Umm...you're not even 14. It is perfectly FINE to not have one at that age!!!...Relax, have fun with your friends, don't worry about relationships until high school! :)|`|maJpBDuvaa	There is nothing wrong about not being able to get a BF. I didn't get a BF till I was 18. You just have to wait till you find the right person whom you think would be a good match for you. Don't just rush into a relationship because most of the times it will turn out bad (such as the guy 'using' you and then throw you away once they are done with you). Be patience, you won't be alone forever, the right guy will show up.|`|cf7CUClpaa	why are u in such a rush  is not a competention  u want to find the right one   than the first kiss will be special  is nothin to be imperases about|`|Pa3hWJ5saa	the more you think about, and look for a boyfriend, the longer its going to take for you to get one. just stop looking and waiting, go on with your usual routine and a guy will ask you out soon enough.|`|xg0jALAgaa	Sweety this is not something you should be stressing about. you have plenty of time to find yourself a male that will love and respect you. everything has its time don't rush.|`|OZzLVnTnaa	you can't rush love-it;ll just happen-relax|`|enfM5mKoaa	are you serious  your still really young, dont worry about it  ppl your age usually just want a boyfriend for the label and because they want that security of being liked.  but seriously, chill  everyone's path in life is different, so stop worrying about the boyfriend thing  just because it may seem like everyone has one, but your not the only single girl  just be who you are and be comfortable with it, thats how you'll attract a boy that you'll really like one day  everything comes with time|`|li9WGkzLaa	I dont know i am 14 and i haven't ever kissed someone who was actually my girlfriend i have kissed a couple girls though just put yourself out there ask someone out wear skinny jeans if you have that kind of figure i like that in a girl just get out there|`|asOlzpTGaa	I know a lot of people with the same problem, you just need to meet some more people.   And no first kiss? Don't worry, it'll happen for you, even if it happens later (but then it's extra special :] ).  Don't become self conscious because you don't have a boyfriend, because there is someone for everyone.
50b446cc42d27523aeb81faf9e2a34aeaa	The boy you are describing seems very sensitive, but that's not very uncommon in our day in age (These type of traits doesn't automatically make a guy gay! I've met my few share of people who seem exactly like this but can't let go of the women crowd).    But based on a few things that you provided, he seems a bit needy, especially with your mention of him wanting to kill himself if you two are no longer together.  It would be in your best interest if you no longer like him to let him go as soon as possible, because the longer you wait, the harder it will be.|`|jlXPsVfdaa	Wow... stay away from him.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	well he is probably gay and needs to be punched in the face. not for being gay but for wearing two polo shirts at one time.|`|BWgV2xSZaa	I think hes the sensitive type who's not afraid to express his emotions. I'm guessing he's the opposite of a self conscious person.|`|pWlVHm6kaa	He's too needy.|`|I2amoo6Kaa	sounds bisexual andno cause he cries alot|`|mHqVnPWJaa	thats a rly tough situation    if you could i would slowly break away from him|`|sebhK7r7aa	He sounds gay or maybe bisexual|`|XbsuY1ogaa	Maybe he's a closet case and is in denial and trying really hard to stay in a relationship so he doesn't 'deviate'.  Or maybe he's just nuts. Don't let yourself get sucked into such an unhealthy relationship, especially if you know it's screwed up.|`|933XLRGCaa	He's a queerbag.|`|B94G0Y7haa	high maitnence. i couldn't put up with that! especially if he got mad at you in public. he sounds like a drama queen. yes, QUEEN. he sounds girly, but not gay if he's that obsessed with girls|`|zwdGBrUZaa	hes either metrosexual, gay or bi or a very sensitive man with a lot of issues at home or something  it sounds like hes the type of guy that needs a lot of attention  people like that are insecure, and they need to snap out of it, because thats unnattractive|`|wZMq5jqyaa	wow. he sounds a little confused. pink is a beautiful color though.|`|5XzeOF9Iaa	wow. . . someone's codependent.  he also sounds like he might be confused about his sexuality.  i'd stay away from someone like that.  something isn't right in his head.  If he calls you, ignore them.  if he's persistent, answer and set him straight.  someone like that who tells you that they would kill themselves if you broke up with them is just saying that.  he sounds like the kind of person that is all talk.  just stay away from him.|`|DUPOEk1daa	He's gay and scared.  He needs a girlfriend so that he can keep hiding from the truth.|`|srfZDygNaa	perhaps he's hiding the fact that he's gayyyy|`|kkIVKvitaa	He sounds really annoying. Like he thinks he's better then other people.|`|MSDiDQveaa	I'm 18 myself - I suppose it's an unstable point in a man's life - I don't think I'll realise how much exactly until I'm a little older|`|Ubpd1h9Caa	Gayyyyyyyy! Don't make him wait longer to figure this out.. just don't talk to him.|`|b05bKonnaa	he's a tender pussy that eats pussy, can't say hes a homo.|`|aEF55nBuaa	YIKES.... give him the D.N.A. of your phone.... DO NOT ANSWER!!!!|`|lkU2jc3laa	He's gay or bisexual but hasn't been able to come out.  Hopefully he will be able to soon! He has to find his inner happiness=)|`|AA12116414	i think hes an obsessed gay guy. just change ur   or somethin|`|7FNCi8fnaa	He's either trying to be like you, maybe you have admirable qualities he himself wants,or he's trying very hard not to be gay. Little does he know, it's not something that a relationship will make disappear.|`|a85CukoUaa	he is a complete mama's boy he might be confussed about his sexuality but he's DEFINATELY a mama's boy thats for sure.....explain that u need time for yourself and if you think that might hurt him then just make up an excuse not to pick up the phone like you're eating or doing something important dont give into him because he will become tooooooo comfortable with you and end up controlling you and expect you to wait on him hand and foot if all else fails request a break and tell him to MAN UP or just leave he can handel it|`|mbn1PmdBaa	He's either metro, bi, or gay.  And totally desperate.|`|ebs0j7iaaa	he sounds unstable and maybe like he needs your understanding - but only as a friend he has too many issues for you to get involved.    If you care enough to ask, maybe you care enough to give him advice, or just listen to his problems.|`|SQOo0n4Laa	You should regret it!! HE IS A BISEXUAL! I can't belive how STUPID AND IDIOTIC this guys is!! EWWW! I'm 13 but still! TAKE MY OPINION!|`|gyQTNC0Iaa	that is just the way he is and u should except him 4 who he is. And so should everyone else|`|9LLKBKOmaa	Uhhmm... sounds like he is gay trying to hold onto a shred of heterosexualism. Tell him you don't like him that way.
fP46meSmaa	I think he likes you.The next time you see him , ask "when are you going to teach me how to catch a football", and yes tell him you like him,I'm sure he will be flattered.**
JbdNFTj0aa	DUMP HER. It gets perpetually worse. Nip that **** in the bud!!!|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	nope never happened to me. dump her sorry a**|`|ZJg26cAmaa	leave before being left      or shes on that certain week    you deserve better bro          men are more equal than women|`|8iAgVLohaa	either she's trying to flirt, you really did do something wrong, or she's having her period, give her a week see if things get better|`|T6HTHXbcaa	she is probably seeing some guy behind his back    so keep an eye on her to see if she is talking to some guy you never know    she likes someone else    or she is on her periods|`|oULsgDRJaa	Your friend is not a real man ... and she realized that she can take advantage of him.    I think he should tell her ... and he should take back some control.    I think that during those 2 weeks or so ... he was a bit too nice with her ... and she knows that she can't lose him, that's why she is acting that way.    It's time for him to find a new girl (but unless he realizes his mistakes ... this will happen again)|`|j4moxmFVaa	Tell her to change the way she treats you or your done with her. Dont just put up with be treated like that girls can be dumb sometimes so dont just go along with her crap.  good luck|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Yes... at least she would if I had a girlfriend!|`|f8c5c19cb27ce51454af3ecf7d02fe43aa	u should turn mean too:  http://www.beingmean.webs.com|`|cc3bc74da528c9ab08e77b61000dc40faa	tell her its over because of the way she is acting. obviously not really what she wants. teenage drama bullshit. blah blah blah|`|PaPXlWwIaa	yea the first 2 weeks is usually the sweet and nice little part so after that your gonna see how she really is...so i say dump her|`|zwdGBrUZaa	maybe its cuz u don't pay enough attention to her, or she might want you to act more like a boyfriend  try being more sweeter to her  maybe shes pmsing..  hmm well if she keeps doing this then dump her|`|wu2g3BtRaa	honey, let her go  the less attention you pay to her the more she's gonna want to be with you but you know what? i'd let her go and find someone who is kind all the time.
MSb3gi3Caa	its great that your trying to help!  no one can be super girl, and for this situation i would say just to leave it, because she can be very hurtful to you, however, if you do want to help, just ask.  i know when im hurt i just want someone to talk to. so all you have to do is listen, if its a bad situation, report it, but if its just hard, tell her that you'll be there for her and help, hopefully after awhile she wont be as agressive  hope this helps!|`|Sp3In8Ksaa	She will eventually kill herself. Stay out of it, it will make the world a better place|`|1ye5MDU4aa	Just be nice to her and when she is a b***h just smile and listen.|`|wAaBOnYXaa	Tell her to express mroe of her feelings.  then you solve the problem  you couldn't win a game when  udont know the rules|`|AA12310760	you can tell her if she ever needs someone to talk to your there for her. :)|`|4npjIcPaaa	i dont know. probably.she definately has issues. just try to be her friend. but dont get too too close she seems a little bit dangerous.
rTibvdiVaa	so let me get this straight you are wearing a lilac color dress and he is wearing a royal blue tux or just the vest?  cake:seems cute  I personally don't think anyone should match you you need to stand out so have the MOH in another color    my color is lilac too and I am wearing a white dress and my MOH is wearing a purple dress while the other bridesmaids are wearing lilac dresses. the groom is wearing a lilac tie and black tux.the best man is wearing a purple tie  and the other groomsmen are wearing a lilac tie.  maybe you should do something like that but substitute the purple with royal blue|`|HM1jdFeWaa	From what I've been told, the groom is supposed to match your dress, and the groomsmen are supposed to match the bridesmaids. so if you had your groom in lilac, the groomsmen should be in a slightly darker or lighter purple or something. my dress is light gold so the groom is in light gold while the guys are in pink (bridesmaids in black with light pink flowers, except moh who is wearing light pink). Its your wedding though so you can do whatever you want!|`|AaoclPYCaa	Never heard of orange flavor chocolate.  No one should match you.  Sounds a bit mixed up to me.  Don't try so hard to be different.|`|pmiKJGJmaa	um... those are interesting colors together. i think it sounds good so far! it sounds like it would be really pretty.
N4GreuqEaa	reason why she gave you number is cuz she wans you to call her.. txt her if u cant call her ...=] good luck..    -is she worth the risk? ask her out...wen things get better after you txt or call her|`|uaK8c0JBaa	Man dude, i'm having the same trouble... i'm going to ask my girlfriend out! (we're both 10) Good luck dude, and give it a shot!|`|WCSN4Ripaa	just tryyy tlkin to her more and being tight once u get the girl will see interest instead of going to parties go out to dinner or the movies? girls liek that|`|AA12310760	she gaved you   for a reason :) so why don't you call her or text her.     also you can ask her if she would be interested in maybe catching a movie or going to get something to eat?|`|zwdGBrUZaa	call her and ask her to go see a movie with you
lvAEDKPBaa	okay, there are two MAJOR problems here    1. You are calling a person who murdered her daughter hot. Mmm, homicide must turn you on!    2. she's actually hideous! she looks like a disheveled inmate|`|VmSKQ40Caa	She is average looking.|`|MQCT1FXjaa	if you say so.  she is slightly attractive.|`|ve0sWDThaa	H*LL YEAH!|`|ksjtZ0J5aa	She's ugly.

mBuXr6Pmaa	I tink he relly intrest if he gots a bonar... cuz bonar generally say dat da guy relly like ur body. N sumtimes da bonar mean dat he jus want sex wit u but if he actin' nice 2 den it mean he down fo you n want u fo yo mind and soul n not jus fo sex.|`|lPCjNkEnaa	He lifts his eyebrows. When a man sees someone he's into, he'll automatically lift and lower his eyebrows, wrinkling his forehead in the process. But you'll have to keep your eyes peeled to catch a glimpse of this telltale signal. Anthropologists call it the eyebrow flash because it's usually lightning-quick.  He stands with his legs spread apart. A guy will often stand with his legs spread apart and pelvis facing you when he's attracted to you. It's a primal, biological instinct, and most guys don't even know they're doing it.  He stands or sits with his toes pointed toward each other. This means he's feeling a little unsure of himself. So if a boy in the club is striking this pose, he's digging you but needs reassurance that the interest is mutual.  He smiles with his top lip stretched wide and his front teeth are just barely peeking through. This tight-lipped look is a polite signal that while he enjoys your company, the romantic spark may not be there. but that doesn't mean his feelings can't develop.  He holds a looong, piercing gaze. Although you may think he's smitten, he could be playing you. Holding intense eye contact for more than five sedonds doesn't happen naturally, so he may be using the look solely as a player's technique to get what he wants.  He tilts his head slightly to the side when your eyes meet. The head tilt is a subconscious come-hither signal that the guy has feelings for you. So if that man you've been meeting eyes with for the last hour gives you the head tilt, that's your cue to go in for the kill and introduce yourself.  He half smiles. There's a good chance this guy just wants a no-strings fling. A sneerlike grin is an indication that he's not being sincere with you, it's a split-face gesture: Each side of his face is telling a different story.  He has a big, broad expression, often with everything showing -- teeth, gums... cavities. Consider it the "Wow, you give me butterflies. I'm head over heels' smile." If it's accompanied by a hearty laugh, look out. If he were any more into you, he might drop down on one knee.  He extends his palm. When a guy offers his palm to you faceup, you know hands down he's hooked. He's literally and figuratively reaching out to the person he's speaking with in an attempt to connect on a deeper emotional level. Even cooler: Our brains respond to hand gestures with heightened alertness (we have a special region that processes only hand shapes), so you'll actually feel the love.  He looks up and to the left. The next time you ask him a sticky question or he wants to explain himself to you, notice which way he looks. If his eyes move up to the right, he's recalling information from his memory. If he looks up to the left, there's a good chance that he's inventing the answer.|`|v8Shukwbaa	Hello Take me with you,     Sometimes guys will just flirt. Some, are hard to read and won't  do anything at all. Yet, some are easy as a book to read. Most guy will stare at you, touch your shoulders and legs, and sometimes your hips. Notice, when he hugs you around your waist if he connects his hands or not. If he pushed his chest towards you or not, and if he laughs when he's around you. These are all features of physical sexual body language; sometimes in result that guys like you. If he sweats, touches his hands together, and/or doesn't make eye contact with you means he's really nervous. If he touches his neck or runs his fingers through his hair can also happen. Keep an eye for these things! And feel free to message me for any further questions.     Hope this helps!
BEyqvqkZaa	First of all, what's the worst thing that can happen if this person finds out? The person can say that the feeling isn't mutual. You never know, this person might actually like you too and this could start something between the both of you.    As for the friend, tell him/her how you feel about what happened without getting out of control. Don't forget to listen to their reasons for what they did. If at the end of the talk you feel that you can't trust your friend or that they are "fake," then make some distance between you. If you feel however that your time as friends is stronger, then don't force them into being an enemy, but keep a close eye on them while they regain some of your lost trust.|`|eDAX46b9aa	Ooh, I feel bad for you! It's not nice of your friend to go around telling people who you like. He is breaking the trust you put in him. You should first of all, put out the rumors that you think will go around. Say that you and Jane Doe are just friends. You should have a conversation with your friend about this betrayal. Why did he do it? Tell him that you really like him, but you can't be friends if you can't trust him. Hopefully he will understand and apologize. As for the person you like, life will go on. The person I like knows that I do, but somehow I manage. I hope that your friend apologizes and that no one spreads rumors about you.
8YfYh3y0aa	What, exactly, is this "move" I read so much about?   Just talk to him.  Get him alone, or call him when you know he's alone and talk to him.   Don't talk about spectacular stuff such as "do you like me" or "you're so handsome"... just talk about small, unimportant things.      see what develops.
5r2Csdzwaa	Broad B will get there 20 minutes earlier so a hummer and a quick slang and she's on her way. Broad A will get there just in time for a quick shower and a longer bang and blow session.    Funny how these DOLTS just don't understand simple math.|`|rP6CHrwgaa	lol.... 2400  Midnight...  :)|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Assuming they left at the same time, Broad A would flip you off driving past you at 5 pm and Broad B would moon you driving past at 6 pm.

Teehee.|`|jTsQkuhHaa	they won't..|`|AA10540570	they won't meet up unless broad b slows the f- down!!!|`|G50ucmllaa	I suppose it depends on a lot.  Broad B could or would eventually pass Broad A.  You would need to make sure you stand in the middle of the tracks at exactly the right moment...it will probably only last about 5 minutes.  But that is dependent on the number of cars in the train.  But regardless, we need the time or the distance.|`|YzObEmUqaa	Broad A + Broad B combine to create one engine running @100 mph  They would travel the same distance  And @ the same amount of time  And they would run straight into my path  We meet up and we would join and embrace each other  Boating down the river in our love-boat  Accompany each other  And we can feel the calm serenity within each other presence   And walk into eternal...|`|85ca6d8875cc233432441b9ee4366fb6aa	Unable to arrive at a satisfactory answer based on the data you supplied.  For instance, where are these broads coming from? Are they both traveling the same distance, or is one traveling a great deal farther than the other?  You could try to get fancy, and time it so that the second broad arrives after the side action with the first broad.  Or you could figure out a way for them to arrive together.  Be creative. The options are limitless when you successfully employ mathematical principles to any life situation.
BwoHmv6yaa	Ohyes. ALL the time. It's kind of disturbing. I know I have friends, because people talk about me on myspace (in a positive way) from time to time. But what I found was easier is to ask other people. They tend to think you're more outgoing and ask you to do stuff more often. If you're uncomfortable with that, drop hints or something. Like "I'm bored, I have nothing to do today". People usually pick up on the hint. Try it.|`|aRIA86D8aa	Yup it happens. But you can't expect others to ask you to do anything if you don't ask them. Don't expect anyone to ask you to go with them if you're not available; make sure they know you're available. If you keep saying 'no I can't go out' they will think you don't want to and they'll stop asking.|`|Yp8vcfj2aa	Yes I have, and its a bad feeling. But keeping to yourself isn't always the worst. Its okay.|`|odmW2elyaa	Yes i have lots the only thing is i found out the hard way that they really did love me and i was to hard on them the whoe time and regert everytime i got made at them for not inviting me somewhere ... truth is just cause they did not ask me to do stuff all the time when i had to move they stayed woth me for 3 hours crying our eyes out ...so yes i have felt that way but really they did like me .. i hope that if you feel this way you will talk to your friends about it and give them the chance i did not

C3DSUacAaa	Long distance relationships are not for everyone. They're hard, they're painful, and they're guaranteed to make your relationship mature in ways that could not be possible otherwise. I have been in a long distance relationship with my now-fiance' for almost 4 years, and for the same reason as you. We see each other 3-4 weeks a year, and the rest of the time we call each other constantly. Skype has prevented us from going broke!    As somebody already mentioned, trust is the key. If you don't have absolute trust in each other, the relationship is destined for rough times and possibly the end. Long distance means you will only have words (written and spoken) to communicate with; can you handle missing out on the physical component of the relationship? In 4 years, you will both grow and change, and so will your relationship. If you stick it out, you will have mastered communication skills that many couples that have been married for many years lack.    My suggestion is to talk about it together, and if you both decide that you are committed enough to trust each other completely, then go ahead and give it a shot! Just don't take it too hard if things don't go as planned, like I said, not everybody's cut out for this kind of relationship. I believe that if you are meant to be together, then somehow things will sort themselves out, so take it easy and go with the flow! Good luck!|`|933XLRGCaa	If you guys are really in a committed relationship and love each other, then your relationship will withstand the test of distance and time.      With the added distance, staying close will become more challenging, but it's still feasible. You'll need to talk regularly and stay updated on each other's lives as if you were still living nearby.  You guys could try "virtual dates."  This where you each eat the same food, rent the same movie, and then talk after on the phone.      Yes, you may meet someone at college, but you might not, and it's silly to throw away what you have for something that might not even happen.    Good luck, and have fun at college!|`|IHzv611caa	Decide if it's worth it. If it is, download Skype and get a webcam.|`|5d8ff2ba83304381d12c6e0005538ec4aa	Sit and discuss it with your boyfriend, see what you both feel comfortable with, then make a decision. Above all, follow your heart. Good luck!|`|XbsuY1ogaa	Propose an open relationship. Be committed, but stay out of the other's affairs if any are had. At the end of every term, talk about the experiences you had.  It may not work for you, but I know many couples who have been dating for many years, and have even studied on different continents, and are still together and in love. But you have to both be okay with it and be honest with each other.  That is the only suggestion I have, aside from sticking it out and stay totally committed for four+ years.|`|mOxVL0luaa	true love can endure the longest length of time of separation. if u felt lonely u can just give him a call or go out when u both got free time|`|MqoQiLcuaa	If you love someone enough you make it work no matter what. If not its time to get ready to move on.|`|eWEd53GTaa	uhhm why doesnt he moved with u??|`|g39i8bJ1aa	i think you shold give long distance relationships a try, i think the L.D.R never work because the two people never trust each other. if you guys have enough trust for each other. i think it is possible for long distance relationship because i am currently having one with my gf in mexico. i live in canada and we have been together for 6 months!      good luck!|`|Brkk1Tuwaa	I know this is the LAST thing you want to hear, but college is a time in life where people change entirely. That means you and your boyfriend too. The same guy you love now will not be the same guy a year from now. Long distance relationships CAN work, but only when both people are committed. College is a time for growing up, SAFE experimentation, and finding yourself. Save yourself the grief, the loneliness, and the anxiety. Enjoy your youth and give yourself some freedom.|`|kSlN7MjEaa	You say are in love with your boyfriend.  You can keep in contact via email, phone, IM etc.  A 3 hour distance doesnt seem that much to me you could maybe agree to meet up once a month or so.  It may fizzle out over time.  Who knows?  One or other or both could meet someone else you are only young yet.  Keep in contact and see what happens. In a new situation you may appreciate him even more as you know each other so well he could be a real help if you have some problems. Dont burn any bridges yet!

647tRaZMaa	It's difficult to completely lose the feelings you have for someone whom you used to care deeply about. It's normal to like a few people at the same time... but treasure the one closest to your heart.|`|AA12290249	um it depends. was this feeling you had like a happy fluttery feeling? or was it just like oh it's him and just.. yeah ha ha.     i would say you probably do at least a little bit. but don't do anything about it for sure.    and yes i do lol it's not feelings of like happiness, just surprised i guess.
srfZDygNaa	good question.   eye contact would be your best bet. confidence the other. and you have to be a little outgoing too.|`|hs04rG7daa	show a little skin and we will crawl towards you
FiCl71flaa	Let us start with the answer to the following question: if she was mean to you from the moment you guys first met, why did you become friends with her, what was the basis of that friendship?. And why have you remained friends with her   since that time if she has been doing everything you now claim she is doing.Plus why do you now feel insecure and jealous if she is the only one guilty of bad behavior. Ask yourself if you do not feel a little bit jealous of her ;maybe she is  pretty, has a lot of attention from  guys, or is a smart gal. There is something missing from your story ,something you are not saying. Until and unless you can answer the issues I raised above as well as the issue of you being a little bit jealous, you would not have an  understanding of the dynamics between the two of you and what you have to do. It will be easier to just say end your friendship with her but I do not think that will solve your problem unless you answer those questions that I posed to you earlier. I wish you the best.|`|aDGcmvaMaa	I can't say she really fits the category of friend, but whatever. If you are jealous of her, you should ignore her. maybe branch out and find some new friends. Real ones, I mean. Or you could confront her, but I don't think that will change much. Hope that helped!|`|Yp8vcfj2aa	Well, don't be mean to her, because that gets you no where. And she just seems to have you as a friend so she can make herself feel better. Don't be jealous or insecure, because she is honestly. Friends come and go, friends will definitely come your way who deserve you.|`|IDQ9DOTiaa	She tries to be nice to you, cuz she likes the attention you give her. Ignore her, shes concieted and shes fake.

GBr9YngTaa	My condolences to you. It's very hard to lose a love one and I can't imagine how you feel at the moment.     At this moment I think you should spend time with family and friends as much as possible. Stay busy and try not to sink into a depression stage. Remember to eat healthy, it will keep your mood up. Get rest. Let time heal you.|`|3HhhHWd4aa	I hate to say it, but you should try dating.    Do not think about moving on, but try to keep company with women.|`|mOxVL0luaa	do u think ur wife is gonna be sad when she know u are griefing on her death? keep in ur mind that no loved one wanna see his/ her partner to be in pain. if u really love her u will set her free out of ur heart and let ur memory be ur past. still try to smile and move forward
ViKhxSQFaa	He could like you but not necessarily. It could mean he thinks you're cute or pretty, which will make him easy to like you anyways. Unless he's some weird guy who just likes to look at you like that =)

AA10086844	A gift isn't necessary and is completely up to the couple.  Some couples get eachother something elaborate, and some couples don't get eachother anything at all.  I don't think that there is any real "rule" about it anymore.  My fiance and I have decided that our gift to eachother will be a puppy that we will get after our honeymoon.  I'm sure that a card would be sufficient, afterall, it isn't about the gift.  It is about the fact that you will be spending the rest of your lives together.    Good luck and congratulations!!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Some do, some don't. There is no rule either way that you must give a gift. Usually the vows are considered your gift to each other. A card would be a nice gesture but isn't required at all.|`|iN27E3WCaa	A gift isn't necessary, but you can give one if you'd like to.  I gave my husband a gift before the wedding, but his birthday was also the day after our wedding so I wanted to make sure all of my bases were covered.    I don't think that writing your FH a card would be stupid.  I think that would be very sweet.  It's your wedding, it's ok to be a little sappy.|`|h0lCiLH8aa	I gave my husband a gift, we got married last may. I also think the note is such a sweet idea.

I'm going to give my boyfriend diamond earrings because he has pierced ears and is constantly looking for earrings. For an engagement gift I'm going to give him a silver chain. I don't think the card is sappy idea at all. I love giving cards and writing long personal notes. This is a special moment, it's good to have as many keepsakes as you can.|`|rTibvdiVaa	only if you want to. I am not buying anything to my husband when we get married.  I think the card will be very cute and the perfect gift...c'mon girlfriend you are marring him what bigger of a gift does he want.|`|mjyRcxUHaa	I did for in 1994, a watch with an inscription.  But I also new he was getting me something.  I would feel around to see If he was getting you something.  You wouldn't want him to feel bad at the start of your new life together.  If you can't be sure, buy anyways and have it in case.  You could always give it at a Birthday, etc. The card is a given, that never hurts. Congratulations!!|`|HM1jdFeWaa	The card doesnt sound stupid at all! I bet it would make him smile. You don't have to do a gift if you don't want to. My fiance and I agreed to do no gifts for each other because we're strapped for cash paying for the wedding. We're promising ourselves to each other forever. It's the best gift we could give each other anyway!|`|VOM75DoWaa	Yes brides do still give their grooms gifts... something special, even it it is engraving his wedding ring.
S4QBvAaGaa	My oldest sibling doesn't talk to me much anymore, however my younger siblings like me.  Where I can relate, is the family situation. My family is the poster of being fake. Unfortunately they're also good actors in criticizing anything I do, then pretending it's out of concern, not being bossy and nosy. I've come to accept that my family is not really what a family should be like, however it's useless to throw away the term "family' since it fits what they technically are, even if it's not what they act like. What do I do? I stay away from the ones I don't like, retaliate with respect but disinterest, and dote on those I do like.  They're not your whole family after all and your likeable nieces and nephews make a point of that.  Which reminds me, move because you want to move, not because you're being chased away or held down. Have strength and no regrets.  Good Luck! :)|`|PZi0X3Zsaa	my dad has the same problem. he is youngest.. its the age gap what they say  so just get going and let it be this way  because otherwise it would hurallotot like it did to my dad|`|ephBKMthaa	Perhaps some of what you are feeling has to do with the age difference, between you and your siblings.  If you didn't grow up together - because they were already grown, it's natural for you to feel disjointed from them.   But they are your family none the less, you are an adult now, so I suggest you stop feeling apart and become part of the family.  Call your brothers and sisters once a week, talk with them, take time to know them.      Make new memories starting now.|`|pQTOngUVaa	im somewhat like that. my sister is 4 years older my bro 5
aRBF37Qpaa	you will not go to hell for cutting yourself, i am a christain and i've cut myself, u just have to ask for forgivness    i'm 14 yrs old and i would love to help you. instant message me at jeremycampbabe@yahoo.com|`|0CvZ3gTwaa	You know who you can go to? The only person that will always be there for you is god and no matter the sittuation or how bad you have messed up he will take you back. Read Psalm 51 and you'll feel better.|`|WKA2iFKTaa	i have felt  the same way about the whole god hasn't helped me so why would he start now but he does start and he was always there u just didn't go to him and didn't listen to what he  was saying . i dint know how to say this without like preaching it to you and i know that's i wouldn't want some one preaching to me but u have to try to understand that he is always there just listen to wat he is trying to tell you it takes a lot to actually be able to understand when God is telling you or if it is just what you want.    But about the pedophile thing you need to show your parents the emails and let them know that you understand that what you did was wrong but your in danger and you need there help!!!! if you dont stop this person they can do it to someone else and that wouldn't be good!|`|XRcrhKTZaa	keep telling people. save your convorsations. tell anyone that will listen. if they dont listen, tell more.|`|xMHFIDs7aa	No of course not. God doesn't send children to Hell, those kids at your school need a serious reality check. What you can do is tell a teacher at school or an adult (other than your parents of course) that you REALLY trust about your situtation. Teachers, by law, have to take action if they know something bad may happen to a student and I'm sure there are many people who believe in you and can help. Try talking seriously to your parents and tell them the whole story. I mean, why wouldn't they believe you?    I'm sure it's scary but please don't cut yourself again. You don't go to Hell for it but it does make people who love you really worried for your sake. GOOD LUCK! :]|`|aXqi9lYJaa	TELL.THE.POLICE!    NOW!

I've cut only once before so I understand. It's hard sometimes. If you really feel threatened tell an adult at school or the police.|`|8bGSmZqxaa	damn foo tell the police....      and p.s i dont like your parents if something happens to you thwy would be the ones to blame because they werent good parents and didnt care for their kid.. and no ur not going to hell as long as your sorry for what you did n i mean really trully sorry and dont do it again = ] and show your parents some of his messages so they can see ur not lieing n if they still dont listein find another adult that will listein to you = ]|`|UezXqDF6aa	look I am glad that you stopped cutting. I dont know what it is like to know that your thoughts could get your to the point that you would cause pain. But i do know what you mean by hurting and wanting to get away from someone like that, I did not cut myself but I had done other things. But as long as you trust god and had faith in him you will be ok and you will not go to hell. I know for a fact if you hurt yourself you will not comdem your self to hell. It will cause you to stand and talk to god God longer explaining why you would damage the temple he gave you.
fLh44W5Haa	I know im a guy answering this but i've been told im pretty sweet, so if i was in your position, i'd slowly start talking to her again. Don't be so jumpy to get straight to the point. Just make it look " hi, i was just talking about how when we....." then say a memoribly funny moment you two had together. That would be a good way to start. then over the week, keep in contact (just on facebook) then after about a week, ask for her number so you guys could talk and catch up. After that, you just have to talk to her about how you feel about her! - girls, was that good? =]|`|XoiScAngaa	pffft just date another girl duh!! i bet she already likes a few other guys too.|`|Ak6HLE5oaa	GO FIND YOUR GURL!!! you need to find her and tell her that you are terribly sorry about how things ended last time and that you are soo sorry and that u still like her and that u REALLY want to make it work! ask her to forgive you and see if you can try again!|`|z8WIAhDVaa	Just try to ask her out again, be gentle, don't try more than twice.

People like the internet so they can hide their feeling. YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO GET TRUE FEELINGS OVER FACEBOOK. now to help you wish you would have gave me your age, cause if you are 14, who cares. But to answer it, facebook is the nosiest thing on the internet. Works in your favor. You might know somebody who knows her. Just be friend with them and once she sees that you know all her friends then she might consider you one her friends. But dont say anything over facebook. Maybe you can figure out where she going to be at from facebook. People are alway on there giving their locations where they are going to be at. Use it, not in a creep way. Just show up and have some friends with you like you belong. Frankly its too much hard work for one girl. I suggest finding somebody near you and going for that. This could take alot of studying her moves and focusing and remembering what she finds important. im not sure if its worth for a person you just met this summer or last summer.|`|gyQTNC0Iaa	Just talk to her then start to ask her for her number. Then after awhile start texting her alot. Pretty soon she'll start flirting and so will u that is when u need to make ur move. I hope everything i said Goodluck|`|xO15PzZzaa	If she was upset about breakinq up. than she'll be happy if you just ask her to hanq out and see what happens (:|`|kRMY5opjaa	start hanging again  make up some excuse like a family problem or something you were dealing with for a while  just call her up or something and ask to hang somewhere  then as you get your spark back ask her out

3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	If you beg it will just look bad. If you can slip him a little note, maybe that just says something cute, like a lock of hair and "think of me" or something, or a pic of you in some lingirie so maybe when he gets' back he'll call you, but try not to look pushy|`|Aw1Kd0eRaa	giv him some time and things will work out|`|n1kLMYCeaa	Unfortunately you can't force him to continue the relationship.  If he is prepared to give it a go it can work.  Before my husband and I married and when we had been together for only 6 months he had to move away for work and was gone for 12 months.  We stayed together and are still together 23 years later.  But ultimately it is up to him - you can't be in a relationship with him if he's not prepared to commit as well.  Good luck.
F3LBgfvwaa	He's not going to wear a shirt like that to attract women, unless he's a complete moron, which probably isn't the case. DANGER GIANT PENIS is totally man human, something he and his buddies will laugh at and we ladies wonder what's so funny.

If it bothers you then you should talk to him about just getting rid of the shirt...but why did he change in the other room...like he didnt want you to know he was wearing it??? if thats the case then you mgiht have something to worry about....and if you really dont trust him then get ready and go down and meet him at the bar and just be like "hey babe i couldnt sleep. I was bored at home so i thought i would get out and come play pool with ya"|`|ZEYkDuxCaa	Honey I wouldn't worry about that shirt, if there is any ladies in that bar. They should be able to read that shirt and know that he wishes.|`|LUhh9bSWaa	You should wear a shirt that says:    Danger "GIANT SWOLLEN VJAY JAY" to get even.    Works good no?|`|AA10540570	I'm sure he's jus being a pig.  Imagine what type of  women this would attract!!|`|W07vMTQvaa	Men have a weird sense of humor.  If you're worried about women hitting on him because of the shirt, well, I don't know many women who believe there is truth in advertising!|`|0d4X54rMaa	oink|`|OWZMSVyiaa	From a mans perspective it sounds like he is just being a pig and trying to impress his buddies.  Trust is key here and not jumping to conclusions is vital.  I'm sure he just wanted to get a laugh from the fellas!  But, calmly ask him "so, you had to wear the penis shirt huh?  Letting your buddies know to stand back at least a foot?"|`|y21VcTjDaa	If I saw a man wearing a T shirt like that, I'd assume he had a very small penis and was merely overcompensating.|`|uxrFOOn9aa	I can see why you would ask this , but let me just tell you  1 I think he is just tying to make his buddys laugh and  2 I as a woman would never be attracted to a man in a shirt that says that on it. I would assume the opposite about his business down there if you know what I mean hahaah dont worry go to bed and then tomarrow ask him how many laughs he got from others over a grown *** man wearing a ridiculous shirt like that out in public!|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	Don't sweat it. My hubby has a drawer full of those shirts and wears them all the time. They are funny and he might have worn it to have a good time and laugh.|`|MqoQiLcuaa	Guys go out with guys to get attention and be noticed. I wear a shirt thats says "COCKS" with a rooster on it just because. Besides most women I know would look at that shirt and think "yea right." Your biggest concern is only if hes wearing it to a gay bar and then thats when you have a real issue.|`|y478zbijaa	he is just wearing that to hopefully pick up some dumb slut who actually think he's funny or has a giant penis.  like everyone else said, don't worry. and make him wear a condom.
aGu49zPsaa	cute if the smile wasnt so overegsadgerated youd be hot|`|R4wEzQZ2aa	no comment   ;/      i think your one of those girls who needs people to say OMG YOU ARRE LIKE SO PRETTY   to have the least bit of self confidence    shallow much     ew and that is so unattractive to guys hun   trust me|`|3eede3c6bfcae1014bd3454cd6dac5e1aa	uuuummm what do you want me to say??  " YOU ARE SO HOOOOOOTTT!"|`|f3vdIrDCaa	u alright|`|Bx6xTLRbaa	You have really pretty eyes. I just don't think it was a great shot, I mean come on, right in front of the camera, smiling like in a forceful way. Just too "trying to hard" you know?
hKlApSxAaa	Well obviously you've every right to feel a bit miffed! Looking on the bright side (er...) it's good that he talked to you about all this, far worse if he'd continued to keep it all from you. I can imagine that what started off as a bored bit of fun has quickly got out of hand and he has been starting to feel guilty about it. This is a GOOD sign  - he doesn't want to betray you in any way and by being upfront about it (albeit in a pretty blundering manner) he might be trying to come clean and get it off his chest (as it were). Perhaps, he'd telling you because he'd like YOU to now take over the role that this other woman has until now been fulfilling?    Hope this helps, I'd talk to him and tell him you're hurt but that you appreciate him sharing his little secret with you.|`|ezMoS0mqaa	id be bloody livid!  That wasnt what you suggested at all-he's done this behind your back.  You aren't being insenstive at all, he has done this in secret and it's not very nice.  Ask him how he'd feel if it was the other way round
50b446cc42d27523aeb81faf9e2a34aeaa	I don't like guys that pay too much attention to their bodies, to the point that they post about it to brag.  They may spend the entire time in the gym and forget about his girlfriend.  Guys that find the balance of work-out for a slightly muscular body but can still play around and chow down with you, that's my type of guy (Whom I already have :P)|`|WMem5AGoaa	Hercules built type of guys are only good for a 1 night stand or to fulfill some hero/comic book Incredible Hulk like fantasy !!    I look at them as male bimbos a.k.a  a "Himbo"|`|sHBPfItfaa	you already asked this....  anyways, i like regular guys, not bulky guys thats just too much.|`|HCWkdk4naa	don't take steroids.  the guys in 300 were computer enhanced btw, so are you a digital image?  i like real men and i like body hair.|`|t2SGVG1Vaa	no, that type of thing really puts me off. sorry :\|`|fBXRNKyuaa	Depends on how tall you are. I'm short, 5'0'', if you are tall and muscular I think I would be scared of you.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	"nicest body" lol    I like guys who look like Enrique Ingelasis and have his body, not overfat, not skinny, not a body builder-just average with nice arms|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I don't like beefy guys. I like lean slightly muscular...oh and if I can't look at your face without gagging or laughing, forget it.|`|dIma3KxIaa	naw don't really like it for a relation but for sex i dig that!!!!!|`|IvIHA5K6aa	Hell yeah!!  im into guys with big mucsels lmfao!|`|dRq6LiXEaa	Uhh, yeah that's hot. But if your a total jerk or all into yourself then honestly I'd think your gross.    But just based on looks it sounds like you are.|`|GoWPQvgHaa	seems kinda like a meat head.|`|YgDO6sxAaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what girl wouldn't want a man that has a body like you!|`|wZMq5jqyaa	ILL. just kidding.in the words of Paris. that's hot.|`|C72xMgl4aa	you know the girls dig that. no way any girl wouldn't.|`|5d9e58518c39d6e4572ea6f984bebbf7aa	no, its too bulky|`|8iAgVLohaa	stop asking the same shitty question it's not my fault thatt most answers said they want a normal guy|`|oyS3Ra27aa	No it sucks lose some muscle meaty.    What do you think?  God. Did you seriously just ask that?|`|n1kLMYCeaa	Girls want more than a good body - although it is nice is is definitely not up there are the most important quality a girl is looking for in a guy.|`|oU4L01s0aa	nope, slight build is good but ur probably too bulky and weird|`|ebs0j7iaaa	you wouldnt have asked that question if you didnt know the answer already...but just to gratify you- yes girls like that kind of body.    they also like a good personality...|`|9WshfnFvaa	Naaaah i like the tall skinny ones, with kick-a** hair. Like the Kaulitz twins. Look 'em up, they r sooo sexy!!!!!!     /\ /\  \_ /|`|DCHvyqOGaa	You might have all that and that's really sexy! Isn't there something else that has to be big to? Im sure your sexy no worries.|`|bq98xZjcaa	um no not really  too built  just a sixpack is fine =]|`|mDsZtyMmaa	err, no|`|mehbohrMaa	To be honest, buff guys make me uncomfortable, it's like they are incapable of being gentle and appear to be aggressive, no offense. Don't get me wrong, being physically fit is sexy, to an extent.|`|nuV7tvVDaa	girls want more then just a good body. i would know im 14 and even though we girls like guys, just loosen up. 6 pack and maybe some built arms r cute but dont try to go overload with it|`|P38ULZbraa	Every girl/woman is different. I know I'm the type of woman that likes a little extra cushion. Not too much tho. I do think there are women out there that will love your body, even so, no one should like you just because you have a nice body, they should like the actual person that you are.|`|HoUdB8COaa	dats way 2 much|`|UXgGGwAdaa	no........girls(including me) doesn't like that kind of body....its tooooo bulky and its like those of the 50s.|`|WVXjgaNOaa	THAT iS WAy SEXy!!!
OWZMSVyiaa	A real man....what is that? I live for my family.  I'd do anything for them.  Does that make me a real man?  I still make time for my boys.  Raise a little hell from time to time.  Does that make me a real man?  What makes me a real man is learning from my mistakes and acknowledging the fact that I made them.|`|8BEFujhHaa	yes i have a real man.  been married almost 1 1/2 yrs and dated another 2 and he is a gentleman if that is what  you are referring to.. have is gentle and very sensitive to my feelings but he is also tough and strong when needed... i can see us being together forever and after being single and long long time for us both proir to meeting we are now both giving it our all and i have never been happier|`|LUhh9bSWaa	that was a horrible horrible video.  Thanks for making my headache worse with those country tunes.    can you say twang?|`|0d4X54rMaa	i have a fake rubber man
d1yfZzCHaa	It sounds like she made it clear that she doesn't want to be anything but friends. But it seems like she is really nice and is just trying to make things normal between you which would explain all the smiling and hi's, if you really like her you might just have to wait and see what she starts to feel for you because it sounds like she is kind of confused what she wants, friends, more then friends, friends, back and forth. If you like her enough she's worth waiting for her to decided.|`|74NfqGGxaa	She said hi big woop. I'm pretty sure that she doesn't like you, ****, sounds like she barely knows you.  Sorry, but your just thinking waaay too hard. Just try talking to her more during class or whatever.
Yi2eHRqIaa	its a pretty loong story to read,  dunno how many answers you will get... but anyways...why dont you just tell him all of that? even if you havent known each other for THAT long, im sure he would like to know all that you mentioned  about bringinb back the old you and whatnot,   dont miss your chance,  just go for it|`|IL361pE2aa	Well being out of high school now for almost 10years there are so many times that I wished I had done things differently. So my suggestion is to continue to flirt have fun with him, let him take the lead and after a few times if he hasn't made a move then make yours. Good Luck

n1kLMYCeaa	Yes there is - if he is not prepared to risk his life to save yours - he is not worthy of your love.|`|bwiLM4jPaa	i would have jumped in front of a train to  save my ex girlfriend... not anymore tho  LOL|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	Yes.|`|BWgV2xSZaa	Honestly speaking, i really would jump in front of a bullet, jump onto the train tracks, jump in front of a car, if i loved the girl enough.

I think that saving any life including your own is an act of God and good faith. It shows character that that individual had the mind to even step up and do the humane thing,and that is to let you live.|`|ZJg26cAmaa	husband    anything less tryin to get into your pants                nough said peace|`|JHfxwDsqaa	yep. a husband or a really devotd boyfriend|`|tSH2yKyvaa	Very few.

Its called mistakes you can't erase.|`|P38ULZbraa	Yeah, if someone really loves you, they would put their life on the line for you. I know I would take a bullet for my fiance.|`|WoEsehoRaa	Absolutely if he loves you.|`|cf7CUClpaa	that gotta be alot of trust and love between two  that kinda of love usually when u know each other from when u too are little kid and u guys have been together for long time  or if he love u that much which u could tell by just simple thing like does he treat u well? is he a slefish person? have he been there when u need him?  riskin ur life for another person is a very courage thing to do  the only person in the whole world i would risk my life for is my mom|`|M6Yk08EHaa	definitely.  One of my closest friends is a person who i use to date.  we decided not to because of how close we were  but he said if anything were to happen to me he would jump out of a plane just to save my life.    There are  it just takes a while to find them|`|RyBAc8Tgaa	Yes there is. It is hard to find, but it is possible if you look hard enough. Once you and your boyfriend are in love, both of you would risk your lives to save the other.

lPCjNkEnaa	Ease into the relationship, become her friend. Once you have been friends for a couple weeks and she's comfortable with you, start being funny. Make jokes and make her laugh. The more you make her laugh, the more likely she is to like you back. Girls also laugh a lot when they like a guy, so get her used to looking at you and smiling. Then ask her out on a date, then later to a dance, and if you're still into her and she seems fine with the dates, as her to be your girlfriend.
SNYYWhD5aa	let her go. you guys have enough problems especially with you being pregnant. you cant stop your lives for someone who doesn't care about theirs. is there anyone else that can help? other siblings? why don't they kick in and help out a bit? if she wants to die let her go. your hands are tied.|`|vlEeaB4baa	Sounds like you've done everything you can.  Tell her you're pregnant and she needs to take care of herself so she can enjoy her grandchild.  Probably a bad idea, but I don't really know what else to say besides, just let her die... I mean honestly , she's a grown woman... obviously she knows what happens to people if they don't get treated for stuff like that.|`|0CvZ3gTwaa	You know who you can go to? The only person that will always be there for you is god and no matter the sittuation or how bad you have messed up he will take you back. Read Psalm 51 and you'll feel better.|`|O3ox6cbbaa	you can just wait it out, tell her to go and that you are pregnant.  or you could slip her sleeping pills and take her to a hospital (not recommended.). tell her that she's being selfish and she's going to kill herself because of it.
77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	How about having a star named after her?  She is turning 18.  She is a "new star" in the adult world.  It could be very appropriate and maybe start a whole new hobby for her.|`|7NPULrV6aa	It depends on how girly she is or if she like more things like sports. Your budget all has an impact.  Maybe a nice necklace or charm bracelet with something that you two do together. Like if you both play baseball something that has thought about her or you two together. Plus she will probably like that you thought to try and make her birthday special.|`|XRcrhKTZaa	fake id. best gift ever. she will adore you|`|YsLmmzwlaa	don't you know that women like any type of jewelry now  if you have the money  and you want your sister to be happy  look for a nice  locker or tennis bracelet she will keep it for ever  god luck
ZfleGhXLaa	Any person can have their name legally changed to anything they want (within reason).  But changing just your surnames should be no problem at all.  Read this:    http://www.namechangelaw.com/states/ga/g...|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Your best bet is to contact the local courthouse to find out. Also, the ladies on the local boards at http://talk.theknot.com are helpful and there may be someone in your area who has already done that who knows from past experience what you can do.|`|FVFxE6owaa	I am pretty sure you can both change your last names to whatever you want when you are filling out the marriage license application.
AA10381933	Wow, that was a pretty lengthy rant about yourself...To start with, if you want girls to like you you have to like yourself (no, not in that way)- you have to be able to appreciate your qualities, what makes you special and different than all other people. You said you like to cook, you can impress a girl by making dinner or baking something sweet and chocolaty. Everyone feels awkward when they're teenagers, even those who are "popular". The key to getting the girl you want is by being confident. It doesn't matter how you think you look, once you have your confidence it radiates to those around you. If you have problems finding reasons as to why you should be confident here are two reasons: the first, think of someone from school who has absolutely no self esteem. It's depressing to be around them, you don't enjoy being around them since all you want to do is to pity them. So, next time you want to feel sorry for yourself think twice because this is what others will see when they look at you. Second, take a piece of paper and a black Sharpie pen and make a list of all the things that you are proud of; they can be your qualities, things you did in the past you name it. Put that list somewhere visible and conspicuous that you'll see it each time you get up in the morning. Most important of, stop thinking about all those things that you think make you look like a dork.     Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|mehbohrMaa	I understand(well the socially awkward part, but I didn't used to be)anyways back to you. You seem like a really sweet boy,acne or no acne.(we all get it, some just hide it better than others.) Gain self confidence. Walk tall, and tackle obstacles with optimism. As for the ladies, they'll come. In the mean time, don't waste your time on the  ones who don't give you the time of day. Some girls are just too shallow to stand. As for the acne, might I recommend washing with clean an clear?Besides, focusing too much on appearance can drive someone to the brink of insanity. I hope this helps. Do yourself a favor and enjoy life. Your only young once.......    By the way, who says you aren't a  "perfectly like able" person? I respectfully disagree.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	high school is a *****.  first thing first.  start treating your acne. I prefer the Mary Kay face cleansers because they work.  Also start using name brand hygiene products and fix your hair every day. putting a little bit of work into yourself can really help you boost your confidence.    Find a physical Hobby. something that you can show off. (video games and computer skills don't count)  People in general (girls especially) are attracted by Competition.     even those guys that yo-yo excessively get called hot.|`|R5mmX9Woaa	Realize that there are other people out there going through the same thing(kind of like me- i'm a little younger and my situations a little different.). Those people that pick on you will probably be working for you some day(you should read Donald Trumps story ha!). Whats wrong with computer games - if they are what you like stick to them. Who cares about girls, a lot of girls in high school are mean and stupid anyway.|`|sebhK7r7aa	Well just be yourself, and maybe a girl will come into your life that actually likes you.

I'm far from ugly but i'm no brad pitt. i know i'm good looking but i don't flaunt it. I know girls in my school like me but because of my shyness i don't know how to respond. I have NO game. When i do respond i completely bomb and everything goes wrong. I'm the type of guy that girls like to look at but when i open my mouth and they find out i don't know what to say they had wished i never did. it's really strange because i'm shy and have no skills with girls.     But i know highschool is drama and more drama. Kids act like little kids and it'll all be over by the time we reach college. In college EVERYONE is cool. There is NO drama and nobody really cares about looks as much as personality. Girls are grown up in college and give you a second chance.     BTW, the looks thinga above i mentioned, is not the benefits i was talking about. I didn't mention the benefits but it ties in with the possible deception and fake friendships and liking me not for who i am but for what i have or where i come from.|`|YgDO6sxAaa	There's a woman out there for you because God put her here for you. she may not come at the time you want or be popular and have everything but maybe that's not what's best for you. she'll come when you least expect it. but in the mean time just be yourself no matter what people say because it's who you are is what brings you closer and closer to the right girl. that's why my mom won't let me date yet because she wants God to be involved in my choosing of who i will end up being with when i get older. and God wants the same for you.  hope this helps. :]|`|uReFjOONaa	lol|`|vQmb8XZPaa	your 16.. run from girls.. please.. they lead you on and cheat on u with ur bff.. like.. u dont want love.. just have fun while u still can|`|zwdGBrUZaa	aw, your still 16 theres so much more years to come  don't tell yourself you are depressed cuz if you do you'll be forever  just hang out with your friends, try and hang out more  when you least expect it you'll find some girl that makes you happy|`|05kAf2DZaa	im a female, but i can relate to you. i HATED HATED HATED high schol. i was the same way, i just looked awkward, had few friends and guys never wanted to talk to me. funny thing is, after high school i blossomed, and now the tables have turned. Im actually grateful now for my past because i know how other people feel, its not right. just keep your head up, everything will be okay. focus on school and go to college where you can totally start over. people dont judge as much in college, because there are no stereo types everyone can be friends with anyone. it will all get better i promise. 16 is a really hard age.|`|OnzUAVdUaa	ur 16 dude. u still got alot of years to go. the right girl will come to u when the time is right. so just be urself around people and dont act like a different person cuz most people like it when u be urself.   keep that in mind.     =)|`|dOnQuOtyaa	Oh shut up Sports G.    Here, it's people with judgement who can't see what's beautiful on the inside of you.    They're too superficial, carried away with looks, smartness.. Really, I wouldn't care about that. It's what's inside a person that counts. Looks fade over time. The inside of a person lasts forever.    And do not worry.. You're just in your teenage years. Teen years, I admit are hard. I'm 16 too. I can easily understand some of the challenges.     When you're grown up, the acne will be gone. If you run everyday, or most days, you will be pretty fit. And you emotions and hormones will finally settle down. You'll go out into the world with a sense of confidence and security. You just have to believe yourself and make sure not to care what other people think of you. It's too bad what they think of you, because they're blind.|`|wZMq5jqyaa	STOP IT!!!! why are u being so hard on urself?? there are going to be plenty of girls who want to date you. you just have to believe that urself. I'm serious. be more confident and think all the ladies love me!!! and u'll start seeing changes. I just sketched myself out, haha,but good luccckkkk kiddddd!!!!|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	You sound like a nice guy.  I'd want to be your friend.|`|Kg9H5ROcaa	sigh|`|Anzu2Nr4aa	personally I think nerdy guys are the cutest ever!  I love socially awkward. it shows that you're not perfect. and that you have flaws. believe me this is a good thing..  and don't go chasing after girls..  really that is not the solution.   I think that you will find the right gal when she comes along..  for now just try making friends with chicks.|`|8RHdLwD3aa	I know this isn't much, but-    *hug*|`|zjEGtuXuaa	I won't lie, it could take a long time  but good things come to those who wait :)  just try to be a bit more outgoing and you'll meet her...  don't worry about rejection it happens to everyone.|`|k3t9dzciaa	Prove people wrong. Lift weights, exercise, get out more, use acne cream. In about 3 months you'll be right dude.|`|oP0lL85Baa	ok.  listen kid.  your mom loves you.  i love you.  people love you.    SO! live your life to the fullest, and the right girl will come around(:    try playing sports you enjoy, making new friends, and just use Proactive for your skin.    AND... when you meet the right girl, cook for her(:|`|sws4tl5Daa	Decent young man..|`|cyfJ7HVYaa	Dont worry dude just live your life to the fullest not worrying about your looks...Sooner or later you will realize that looks is not importants what does matter is the attitude and good manners...i see the character of my hubby in you he is just an average man but he dont down himself saying that he  just said no woman will ever look back on her but for me he is the most amazing husband in this world...Looks will fade away but good heart doesnt...|`|WEsFpJ7Haa	Read    "The Game" by Neil Strauss    although it's in quotes i assure you that it is a book.     a few pointers if you resent buying the book which i have read and is totally worth it:    1. Join a sports team, any sports team (I liked swim team, theres girls in bathing suits, you get a nice tan, you make a load of friends, not only in your team but other schools as well)    2. If you don't have nice clothes already i recommend you buy some. although it is corny you have to "dress for success" nice clothes will give you confidence and i'm thinking that's what you need    3. Go to a professional salon and get your hair done, girls love guys with nice hair.    4. If you'd rather not do any of the above then just simply maintain your hygiene and you'll grow out of it. but by the looks of it i don't recommend this option.    in the end once you believe you are the best you will become the best. you have to throw away all the bullshit in your life and all your past experiences that tel you other wise. rise up to the occasion and don't back down. If this is something you really want then you have to work for it. Once your confidence kicks in you will have a passion to keep your body in shape, and look your best wherever you go. by the way, the fact that you cook is a plus, so use that into your advantages, because there aren't many guys out there with this skill.     good luck.  hope that helped.|`|SQOo0n4Laa	I'm 13 and single and you don't see me complaining.|`|P38ULZbraa	You know, you'll probably hear this a lot, but you will find an amazing girl, just for you. All you can do is wait. I know you're young and see everyone else in high school with either a girl friend/boy friend. It's hard to see especially on Valentines Day. All you can do is find a nice girl that doesn't just tolerate you, but loves you for the inner beauty you have. As for the acne, you're a teenager! You'll grow out of it, it's just your hormones. Good luck [:|`|o1B8obliaa	Alright dude this is what I can tell ya: it's unfortunate that you've had bad luck, but there's always someone out there for ya. However it couldn't hurt if you'd like to make some slight changes about yourself. Start slow, one step at a time.  You can try to be open minded and understand other people's feelings, how they react to certain things, what is their prospective on certain things.  Do some research on what most guys wear nowadays, it's good to keep up with the looks.  Do some research on different hobbies that a lot of people take interest in, and that's how you start meeting people. Ever given a thought about piercings/tattoos? they're awesome, look great, and certainly attract a lot of attention. Things can get better soon, especially if you choose to go to college.  You'll be meeting new people, getting involved activities, etc.  Just be cool man, don't try too hard, don't try to force it, and be very very patient; because you are young, and you've got a whooooooooooooooooooole life ahead of you. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|kSlN7MjEaa	You seem to have a very low opinion of yourself.  You are comparing yourself to others who are smarter, better looking, smooth talking etc etc.  People will treat you the way you expect to be treated - guess how you come across then? Everybody has doubts about themselves its just normal. Just be who you are and dont worry.  I know what its like to have acne  but there are good treatments for it now so go to the doc and ask him about them.
rRO3x9hZaa	Why does she want you to break up with him. If you are happy and he is treating you right, I don't see why your best friend would want you to break up with him. A true friend wants you to be happy.|`|Anzu2Nr4aa	Usually the friend is always right.   try to see her side of the story before you freak out on her and tell her that its none of her buisness..   mabye she's worried about you?  idk.   But if she has some stupid reason like "I don't like his haircut" then tell her that you love him and you want to be with him. and if she doens't like it then thats too bad. you still want to be her friend. but you don't want to stop dating him.   idk.   hopefully it'll help.|`|tF9Hq23daa	tell her.  "female dog u needz 2 get out my bussiness if u was a real fren u woudnt b talkin 2 my bf behind my back."    but like for real maybe you should just talk to her.    and u need 2 put more details|`|AA11278326	i feel kinda guilty b/c i'm sorta flirting with my friends "boyfriend" well they actually are just dating. but he is fun to flirt with. I don't like like him just want to flirt for fun.     i feel a bit bad.|`|U25RAqyoaa	Usually I would say that you should choose your best friend over your boyfriend. But sometimes you have to decide if your best friend is worth dumping your boyfriend.|`|aXm6wS8paa	well you have to think about that    who do u care about the most and why    also think why ur friend wants u to brake up  if they really where ur best friend they would not be telling you this      good luck =)|`|PV9YFZNmaa	then she is not much of a friend and she's the one that needs to be dumped get rid of her and go on with your life with the man that you love.|`|I3FsrJPuaa	does she has any good reasons for you to break up with ur bf?  is she jealous maybe? are you not trying to balance ur time with her and ur bf?|`|vzfj3Bgraa	Does she have any legit reasoning behind this?|`|AqHm4IQyaa	Slap that *****.|`|mr7AIkuKaa	your friend is just jelous..  if you love your bf..  and your bf loves you..  then ignore your friend..|`|C72xMgl4aa	if she's two-faced she's not worth having as a friend....you never know what she's saying about you behind your back. maybe she just likes him, and wants you to break it off, so, she can take him. i'd stay w/him!  hope i helped. =]|`|H9deeyqgaa	Sounds like they are both jerks for putting you in the middle|`|oNhIoVLIaa	I agree with one of the posts ahead of mine, idk if she has a legit. reason.

In love and in war, there are no unfair tactics. Hence, you should use your own tactics and fight for him if you are really serious about him. However, if you are not sure, perhaps a cooling-off period is the best solution.|`|r1KTZBkraa	does she have a legit reasion?|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	maybe she is seeing things from an outside perspective. you are emotionally involved so you wouldn't necessarily see things he's doing that will hurt you in the long run. maybe you should talk to your friend and ask her why she wants you to break up with him.    that or she wants you to break up with him so she can date him.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	you went out with him 4 months and you love him?

JDRpNw20aa	if you're really so popular, nobody will care that you're dating him, and you could cause a stir for changing things up a bit ;)    but...    if you really like him that much, then it shouldn't matter what he looks like because something so minor shouldn't stop you from being with him    good luck :)|`|WniOOchkaa	Do what you want to do...it's not about looks either. I once had a friend tell me the guy I'm dating was ugly and I could do much better.  Well, I married that guy and we have a good life.  She dated guys based on looks and now she's got a baby with no daddy to take care of it.  You should think more about his personality, how he treats others, and if he has good morals and goals...and also if you two seem to get along with each other.|`|HFjn9KtDaa	u sound snobbbby =]=]|`|a7mDYbxYaa	go for it it ain't all about what the boy got or looks like x|`|fXfZ3Dkbaa	If you like him why don't u ask him out? If you don't want to date him because of what they think then you are just as stupid and immature as them. Your not always going to agree on their choice of boyfriends so why should they have to agree with your choices? If you think that you and him could possibly have some chemistry GO FOR IT. Who cares what they think!!!!!!!!!!!
cIFzMX30aa	well she definitely likes you ......... and if you like her too then why dont you ask her out.she will be so happy when you ask her out trust me.its cute....i hope u will ask her out .....good luck|`|PALYUI0Haa	Yes you should ask she out, because you have been going out with her for 2 1/2 years, If you were thinking of not asking her out, then she would not like you for ever.     JUST ASK HER but make your move slow , as if you really mean it from the bottom of your heart dont be a jerk and just do it|`|8f4acd3c68f5f334ef3c1859186f22c3aa	Go for it Tiger.

5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Of course you can't afford him anymore YOUR NOT AN ATM machine   It seems that he only has you around so that you can give him money he is NOT going to pay you back - he needs to get it together already and go out and find a freaking job no matter what it is. everyone suffers through bills and making money but we all do it because we have to he just doesnt want to.   You maybe should tell him that your leaving him if he continues to do this to you. you need to support yourslf for once and let him think of his own needs -|`|dItZAwI2aa	u make the decision because the wedding vows say:    "for better, for worse, for RICHER, for POORER, in sickness and in health 'till death do us part".    if money is a big issue as to who's paying for what then u need 2 move on and save ur money.    many don't marry based on what the other makes, many marry based on love and work thru hard times together towards a brighter future.    good luck and GOD bless.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Big Red Flag!  Tell him to get a job or you are going to leave.  Be firm and serious.  He blows his money and then he blows yours.  LOSER|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	He's finished.  You bailed him out before, and now he has become dependent on taking the easy way out...being pathetic and having others rescue him.  He needs to fend for himself - time to sink or swim.  If he can't take care of himself that way, how would he be as a future husband?|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Gee, I wish I could find a summer job that pays $80,000.     He doesn't sound too ambitious, really. You cannot afford him, let him go.|`|96zZlJVYaa	After reading your question twice and it still come up with the same results. When he were making $80,000 in a few months, he should had bank some of it for a raining day rather spend it senseless. Now he doesn't want to look for a part time job to paid his own bills rather sit on his rear and complaint. That is not a good sign for any guy who planning on getting married. He should be willing to work a part time or two to paid his bills and stop whining about money. Yes, you had enable him by loaning him money, now he is excepting you to continue to give him money when he whine.     You should limited your finance to him this way he would have to get out and find work. Please don't make this same mistake again with any man!!! Give him some tough love one help out for one month and give him the wanted ads. There is no reason for him to borrow money from people whom he can't afford to paid back. He is only add more stress to himself and you. Since he is not in school for now, why does he feel to turn his nose up and make that kind of statement "not enough to make a difference". It make a huge different when he is not bring in any income.    Rule number one, if you're not married to a person you should limited your fund to help your partner to paid their own bills. This way they don't depend on you to bail them out and hinder them to get out and look for a job.     I see this a huge RED FLAG, SLAPPING YOU SMACK DEAD IN YOUR FACE!!  I give him one more chance and if he doesn't want to get out and find work then to paid his bills, then he should be on his own.|`|Yl8pOCAMaa	Dump him. What a freakin' loser.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	He sounds very lazy.  Like someone who just wants a handout and wants everything to be easy in life.  He needs to grow up and learn that money isn't come by easily and we all have to work hard every day for what we have.     This is a red flag, in my opinion.  He needs to mature a lot more before you two should even consider getting married.  You sound like you're on your feet and have a steady job and are financially independent--you need to marry someone in the same situation.  I would call off the engagement (if you're engaged) or even take a break from each other until he can get things squared away and get a job.  Every one in this world needs responsibility, and it looks like he just wants others to take care of him.|`|O1b7das7aa	There's an expression that goes something like, "...past behaviors are a good indicator of future actions...".    Your boyfriend is whiny, unmotivated, parasitic, lazy, dramatic and immature.    Dump him.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	stop loaning him money. Stop offering to pay his way. Stop treating him like a child. Stop offering to take over his financial life. Stop offering to run his life. He's a grown man-- don't be his mommy, let him act like one.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	Your boyfriend is into making lots of money in a short amount of time.  He has no idea what it means to hold down a job 5-6 days a week, 40-50 hours a week, consistently.  And he doesn't seem interested in doing what "normal" people do.......hold down a regular job, make a budget and stick to it.  He doesn't want to live within his means.    I wouldn't stick around.  He's never going to be anything but a financial burden.  He gets what he wants.....and you'll be stuck figuring out how to pay for it.   I say it's definitely a red flag and it's time to bail.|`|833d3998e43d4ddd7ca29670d85d6648aa	For the love of god, why do people ALLOW freeloaders to take advantage of them?  Have you lost it woman?  Cut him off!!! That's the best way to see if he really loves you or if he is using you.
evW18jvIaa	I wasn't a virgin when I got married, but the only man I've been with is my husband.     As far as our first time went, it wasn't scary or awkward. It's an expression of passion and love, and you'll be surprised at how easily and natural it happens.     Just make sure that if the pressure is too great, as he's entering you, you tell him hang on or slow down. Just keep kissing and touching in other ways until you're ready for him to continue. This keeps up the arousal, doesn't kill the mood, and allows your body to get used to him in you. Do it this way and it should barely hurt.    Good luck and just let it be natural. Remember, the sex you have on your wedding night is a physical confirmation of the vows you just made to each other. Just go in there ready to express yourself and give yourself to him forever. |`|qpAYU8Knaa	No. It will be a great experience for you as long as you love each other. No need to be nervous at all.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	You'll probably be nervous. But everyone is nervous their first time so it's not a big deal. Good for you btw... I promise you it will be sooo worth it to do that with someone you love and trust.|`|PqSxN71Baa	Great! Its worth the wait.|`|Yl8pOCAMaa	I'd imagine that you would be nervous. I would start watching porn to learn some tricks so you can blow his mind.
lz4nK3ibaa	i don't think flirting is a bad thing at all, if you're in a relationship that is strong and you both know where you stand there are no issues.     I've been with my partner for 5 years, and I know he still flirts... I think its funny.    I also flirt when I'm out with the girls.... Its nice to know you're still attractive and that you've still got it in you...    As long as it never goes further than flirting I don't think there's any problems with it.|`|PNxEQazraa	I'm really not the master to talk to about flirting. My friend, she couldn't go out with a guy because flirting is like her own personal crack. Anyway I think that it's really not good for the relationship you're in. It's really your choice though.|`|dh3l99QXaa	i think it is wrong because, it can cause the other person you are committed too to feel insecure and i use to flirt when i was committed to my last girlfriend even tho i never would or did cheat on her.    I did it i think because i felt insecure myself.  What made me quit was one time this other girl whom i had previously flirted with was drunk grabbed  and kissed me and the girl never would have done that if i had not flirted with her to start with.   It made me stop to think about my habit of flirting and led me to believe it is wrong because, of the problems it can cause and how it can make the person whom you are committed too feel|`|JoYNivgwaa	You should not flirt if you are already in a relationship. That means you have no honor cause you can't even control yourself.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Most people think it's bad, but some people just can't help it (like me lol) but no, I won't do it in front of my boyfriend because I have respect for him. And I'll  only smile or wave at a guy that's all, nothing more, that's bad.|`|zRL1P57haa	if you are serious and passing your time with a friend it is friendship .|`|eAr8zBrraa	when you flirt with someone and its NOT your boyfriend or girlfriend, then thats pretty bad... flirting is like "messing around" or arousing people.... if you flirt with someone who you are going out with thats not bad at all... i find flirting with your boyfriend/girlfriend kinda cute =D and girls love it when guys flirt, well.. i do..
m4T0IT0yaa	You're not being too jealous.  You just don't trust him.  That's the bottom line.  It isn't about lifting weights or what he looks like or any of that.  It's about trust, honey.  When it's non-existence or low, everything is a major ordeal.  Get to the bottom of things with him. Talk to him, talk it thru.|`|aSjHI5jUaa	you have a right to be jealous- don't overdo it though...it can push him further away, but make sure he aint doing anything, your instinct will tell you. you know, the one when you know deep down, or you've had a dream and you wake up hating him, thats your instinct!! when you walk in one day and sense something isn't right, when he kisses you differently, has sex with you differently, when he seems withdrawn or fustrated you will know, then you will never need to accuse again, you will just know.|`|0QRDC2R1aa	I would be the same way.|`|2sF0qPjBaa	I would be cautious.|`|igJJ37Tjaa	There is no kinda in cheating. You have a right to not trust him.|`|dEFap0Zaaa	I always say...........once they cheat they will repeat.......so no.....you are not over reacting|`|jZH3eaEZaa	what do u mean KINDA cheated??  If he cheated then yea...u r not overreacting    once a cheater.......|`|aY9v3SJKaa	Yes your being jealous.....jealous because you don't really trust him. Get over being jealous or your gonna have the same problem and even worse when your married. You either trust him or you dont~~sounds like you dont.|`|th7C1aoaaa	What are you waiting for?  Don't think for one second he would never do it and that he only had cyber.  Go ahead and bury your head in the sand. You will only get hurt later.|`|IOga0Brraa	Get out while you still can!!!! It's 100X harder, more painful and expensive to divorce than to break an engagement- trust me. LEAVE HIM or you'll be in my miserable getting divorced shoes.|`|kbz5S3waaa	i would be the same way if i caught him cheating before|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Tell him how U feel if U have not already. He needs to know this now before something else comes up. If he is not very understanding, then maybe U do have a reason to be jealous.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	That's a natural reaction to having been cheated on, isn't it?  You begin to analyze the way they structure their time, the way they communicate with other people, whether they spend free moments on the computer or taking text messages in private.  he's crossed a line...for you, that's not jealousy, that's more just accountability.
YraPn46waa	Why both of course! Don't restrict yourself at such an early stage. It's perfectly okay to get to know two guys. In fact, it's good common sense. It also means neither guy becomes the be all and end all, which means you can relax and get to know them both. Enjoy!|`|F3YoHzOCaa	go for both, get to know them both before choosing.  you don't want to miss out on a great guy because you're chasing some loser.|`|m99D31vTaa	I personally think the music class dude lol|`|GoEdpprvaa	I don't think you HAVE to focus on just 1 of them. Start up a convo with both of them at any opportunity you get. Don't be shy. It sounds like you know more about the guy from music class, so if you feel you HAVE to decide, pick him.    GOOD LUCK :]
LTDlVS7Oaa	That's why, because your the best one. And she knows that if she lets you slip you'll be just like everyone else. Don't be in a hurry really its not that exciting. When you get older it'll be funner. Just relax your not the only kid to stay in.|`|rh12tX8Naa	Just ask her. Tell her you don't understand why and ask her what you can do to make her agree to let you go out.
rM63IEfzaa	yeah, i think it was flirting but your "guy" sounds really immature  i mean seriously...who would pour a freezing cup of water on a girl he really likes.  most likely, if you're thinking about getting into a relationship with him, you should wait until he's grown up a little  its a little obvious from his last relationship that he's not matured enough to handle one and that he needs a little more time to think about where he stands before he should move onto the next relationship    he probably makes you feel really good about yourself because of how he is and the possible hopes you have for eachother, but again, try and wait it out :]  -the reward for waiting is always best if you wait a little longer|`|aWvuZJjRaa	awwhhh.!!    yess!!!! i think he was. and if you likes him, go for it hun.  life is only so short.... like, if he was to die tommorrow (knock on wood, i hope he doesnt). would you regret not telling him??  YES!!!!!  so tell him!! :]
wb8WwWMNaa	Not really.. for the Soph. dating a Sr. it's just two yrs. But like the way he's swooning the other chick ain't good.|`|WibrSWyYaa	not rly|`|JzR7DsULaa	Something tells me you are really jealous of this girl.  She likes him, he likes her, nothing wrong with that.    Grow up.  Are you like 14?|`|A0a6QKO1aa	You should get out of other peoples business and quit judging them.|`|S7VJ1GDdaa	Sounds to me like you are jealous?! There is nothing wrong with a senior dating a sophmore. My husband was a sophmore and I was a senior, and if we had been at the same school we would have gotten together earlier. I graduated in"87" and I guess it was no big deal because that stuff happened at every high school that I knew about. I guess if you were in her shoes, then you wouldn't be belly aching?! By the way, this guy must think that she isn't "ugly". Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and he is beholding her! Also the only one that sounds like it is awkward is you because you are pathetically watching like a "perv"!|`|SKqTyJD6aa	its none of your buisness...stay out of it!|`|WB028eTDaa	Sort... of? Not really? People date people younger than them all the time.|`|atmDaT61aa	omg grow up  highschool is not everything  its 4 years out of your whole life get over it|`|29maScwJaa	They can do what they please!    Somebody's jealous! :P|`|vwoqIUR6aa	sorry but you sound jealous|`|cn2B9ebJaa	Grow up!!! and its none of ur busines!!|`|rTZc5rhaaa	i think you are just jealous.|`|tYutrD8Taa	No, it's not awkward.  Sounds like somebody's jealous. . .|`|m3UGI2BCaa	I think you need to focus on your own goals in life and leave happy people alone.|`|AA10529674	You shouldn't care what someone else does with their life.|`|lRNAlYyXaa	I THINK YOU SHOULDN'T CARE because we don't. Seriously get your own life to ask questions about and stop worrying so much about other people's decisions if they don't affect you, which they clearly do not in this situation.|`|lb6s0Yvhaa	hahahah  why do you care?  if its not your relationship ignore it  unless you like this guy?|`|G02vO6Jwaa	well, you should move on and stop caring. it seems like you are jealous. you can go after someone else and b the envy of other people maybe.  good luck.
XysYiksbaa	well im a mum & i WOULD NOT stand for a teacher talking to MY daughter like that!!!    is there not someone else you can talk to if your mum doesnt believe you? i would speak to the head master     how old are you??|`|8aFOSlHWaa	WOW! that teacher sounds really creepy.|`|t8gWcBaeaa	dude wdf.  chill out.  stop tryin to be a smartass n talk bak to the teacher, man i hate ppl like that.  mayb if u have BEHAVED n not talk bak, this proly wudnt have happend:)  n dont come here talkin like do nytin wrong? haha..laaame.|`|rh12tX8Naa	That's crazy! Definitely go to the principal's office and bring your friend as a witness. That's uncalled for. Where is your dad? Can you talk to him about it?|`|7xGtL1vxaa	This all sounds a little far fetched to me. I don't really think that a teacher would yell at a student and get up all in their face, especially since you are suppose to be a new one there. You also must have a reputation for having or causing trouble for your mother to say what she did. As for agreeing with you, no, I'm sorry but I do not. Sounds like you have a smart mouth on you and you need to learn to keep it shut and have more respect for your elders/teachers.|`|3oSSTeeeaa	oyyy|`|RC2aQBkgaa	get the mofo fired and tell your mom to shut the he|| up because that freggin teacher is off her nuts|`|8RsvFTEjaa	WOW! Ok talk to the principal (or at my school its the guidence counselor) and tell him what happened and get your class switched. People do that all the time unless your school is like very strict cuz i know my school definitly isnt. Try it out it doesnt hurt to try.|`|CEqYjcBeaa	I'm siding with you on this one sweetie. School is not the military, the teachers have no right to get in your face and yell at you. The problem is that unless you can prove what she did, and I'm not just talking about people in the classroom vouching for you, then there isn't much you can do against it. The school system will naturally believe the teacher over you unless you can prove otherwise or the ENTIRE class speaks up.   As for your parents, they should be understanding. I don't see why they would freak out on you like they did. Doesn't seem right to me. I don't even know what to say about that one. They should trust you over the teacher unless you have proven to be a problem child in the past. Simple as that.|`|DFXyD8riaa	Yes hello, i was reffered here from a prego question.    It seems to me that you need to learn some manners.  Quit being a baby.      Does anyone else have any questions for the answer master?|`|JyQIR20waa	well i think yur teacher is completely crazy. im a calm person but i fix problem with violence and i wouldve puched her face before she could even finish screamin and im sry but yur mom real dramatic way to dramatic.|`|8zJy3jeOaa	Um I would talk to another teacher about it babe or maybe your counsler. I would. Because I am so sorry that teacher seems violent to me. Who does she think she is.....and your mom....well.....I dont get what her problem is.     Look dont talk to someone your own age because they are just going to give you bad advice. And dont cry babe....thats not going to help the situation its just going to make you feel worse.    And I would def ask your counsler if you can switch out of the class and into another room because you dont feel "SAFE" around that teacher.    I promise it will be okay. And it could be that teacher hasnt has sex in a long while or is just PMSing! LMAO    Hope I made you laugh a little!!    muah!  See you answered my Q about it being boring today and I came to you Q.....see I help you you help me!!!    Luv ya!|`|5bqw2APsaa	Don't talk back to your teacher, don't even try to challenge them most teachers are really experienced in this so don't be fresh or you'll find yourself in some trouble. When shes yelling at you just be sorry and look at her like your sorry and she'll stop.|`|9DB04OAtaa	Well obviously she cannot get all in your face. the last time a teacher did that to me, i told him to get the **** out my face. and he gave me a saturday detention for disrespect and profanity. but they cannot do that. he kept on, so i talked to the principle. and the principle got a lot of other complaints and he told him if he continues, he was going to get fired. ever since then, hes been nice. and hes been kissing all our asses. lol. maybe you should talk to your principle or someone and let them know, she's being a little rough.|`|3gx7H0zMaa	What kind of school are you in?  If you are in private school, they usually can get in your face.  If you are in public school, the teachers usually have a code of conduct they have to follow.  If you are really that worried about it take your concerns to the principle.  You may also want to put a recorder in your backpack or purse so you can record her behavior and play it back for the principle and your parents.  I am sorry your mom said that you are a shame to the family name, but it does not seem that way from just this incident.|`|RmBF0mydaa	Wow! Mind your p's and q's around that one if you can't switch. Afraid to say, chances are you'll have to deal with someone like that again at some point in the future, and if it happens to be a boss, your reaction could possibly find you unemployed.    No matter how strict she is, acting against her just seems way too much of an inconvenience for you, especially since your parents are sided against you. I don't think it's worth the aggravation.|`|CgvmWNLYaa	omgosh! see an authority at your school (guidance counselor, principal...) she was way out of line. you might not have needed to back talk quite as much, but i agree, you needed to stand up for yourself. as for your mom, she just blew your trust. she was way out of line, too. there's no rule that says you have to tell her everything, and when you felt like you could, she blew it. im sorry for you! but seriously, talk to guidance and/or the principal...
Q0Cq3G2Taa	a good perfume or a nice light colour shirt which r easily available anywhere but if not possible just make him something delicious think think think i hope u come up with something'    best of luck|`|GHd84xipaa	ya you can fix him a birthday dinner or take him out to eat.i think he would love neither one.bake him a cake and give him a card.|`|8RsvFTEjaa	Hmmmm. Try to go to the mall and pick up a nice shirt for him thats what id do for my dad|`|EHRI5ZxIaa	Dress up nice,go take you some pictures,or a portrait of yourself|`|NrINUcWMaa	Your dad would love for you to make him a coupon card.  You could make coupons for like....a car wash.... walk the dog.... mow the lawn.... make him something special for dinner.... you know.  All the things that will be special for your dad because you are special to your dad.  Make him a cake, or a pie, and give him a beautiful hand made card.  Good luck but dad's are really big ole softies and LOVE whatever their daughters do for them.
R4RYtKDCaa	wow, thats one hell of a question man.   my experience is that no, they are not a HUGE problem, if you try to keep in mind that different people have different values and opinions.    My mom and my wife get along pretty well now,  it wasnt always like that though.  At first they were leary of each other and it took awhile for them to find some common ground.  I would suggest thinking about the things that you gf and mom have in common.  For mine it was sewing--  they both liked making things from scratch.  So  after a couple years of being polite to each other, they became actual friends because of this hobby.      good luck with this!!  Its hard to be a good son and man at the same time when the two most important women in your life don't get along.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	If your mother hurts your gf in any way, keep them away from each other.  Let your mom know that you expect her to behave to any woman that you are dating, and especially one that you may become married to.  She will have to suffer the consequences if she is mean.|`|AA11865682	Of course your mother is worried about you! She's your mother and the last thing she wants is to see you marry someone who may not be who you think she is. People are often blinded by love and I'm not saying that you are, I'm saying your mum is worried that you are.  Sit your mum down and have a chat with her and tell her all things you just said in your question. Your concerns are very normal. The two most important women in your life have not met yet and you are very understandably worried that they won't like eachother which will leave you stuck between a rock and a hard place for the rest of your life.   You have nothing to worry about. If they don't like eachother but they truly do love you, they will get over it for you.   Good Luck. I hope their meeting is everything you hope it will be.|`|IOga0Brraa	I think you should talk to your mom and your girlfriend. You have to stick up for your gf though- make sure your mom knows that you won't put up with any rudeness or anything of the sort. Tell the gf that your concerned about your mom being 'weird' around her. Like a warning almost.   If you truly love the girl, your mom will see that. If this girl makes you happy, your mom will see that also.   Sometimes it helps to do stuff together- bowling, mini golf, stuff like that. Much less awkward than a stuffy dinner at home.|`|tUj3fulYaa	A lot of mothers are very wary about losing their sons. I was afraid that my boyfriend's mother wasn't going to like me for the longest time. We spent time together and she loves me to death now. I think you just have to wait until they meet and get a chance to actually talk. Mothers do know best. If your girlfriend really is a great girl, your mother will see that.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Don't you think you are overreacting just a tad?  So far the only thing that has occurred is that mother has expressed some concern and asked a few questions, that's all. I'm sure you've told your mother how strong your feelings for this girl are so this could cause your mother all manner of concern that has nothing to do with the girl. Mothers  only want what's best for their children so naturally she will be  apprehensive when her son brings home 'the one.'  Your kind of thinking, projecting doom and gloom in situations to come,often make self fulfilling prophecies. Calm down and don't obsess over things that have not and may not ever happen.
5DJzp6bMaa	NO they Cant , You are Not The Parent of That Child so No You Do Not Pay Child support to her.  They Take the Money Out of His Paycheck and the Amount is Based on His Gross Per 40 Hours.  Federal Guidlines are 25% for First Child and 5% added to that for each Child up to 45% of his Gross.  And Your Kid that you have With him Does Not Matter to the Court System as far as his Amount he has to Pay her.  If He is In Jail or out Of Work they Just Keep adding it Up for Him To Pay later and File your taxes Seperatly Because if He Is Behind they Will take it If His Name is on It.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Do yourself a favor and don't marry him.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	yes they can and they will. Once you are married, your income becomes one. So they will. If you want to avoid this, then don't get married. Just live together.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	The other woman is going to be a problem. And if U marry this jerk, yes, she can get part of your paycheck. So don't get married.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	And why are you with this guy?  They can not take money from you to pay her.  She can not prevent him from seeing the child.  Why did you let her have her back, anyway?  What does the custody order say?  If there isn't one, get one now.  Support arrears will accrue while he is in jail, so he will owe that when he gets out.  The fact that he has another child will be factored into the calculations.  And why are you with this guy?|`|y4SUDnpaaa	They cannot take money out of your paycheck for your bf's, or husband's, for that matter, child's support. Those are his children and his responsibility and only he is required to pay child support from his wages, no one else's.|`|2PTzgYuvaa	I don't think so unless he is delinquent and you have joint accounts|`|GKPY3t56aa	It's legally your husbands child so he is the only one responsible for the child support. To prevent any confusion you may want to keep separate bank accounts.  Yes, they should take into consideration your son. They will credit him for that.   If and when your husband goes to jail he will not be bring in income therefore no child support can be paid during that time.|`|833d3998e43d4ddd7ca29670d85d6648aa	ABSOLUTELY NOT.  However, what are you doing with a guy with an ARREST WARRANT out on him?  That is your problem!  Also, it is his own stupidity for making babies with different women in such a short period - he is fully obligated to pay full support to her.  And no wonder she is pissed, he handed her a bullsh*it line, she fell for it & got knocked up.  There is a lot of very bad decision-making in this situation & the poor kids are going to end up paying the price for their parent's stupidity.  You need to open your eyes, he is a dirtbag.  Why would you even letting his stick his nasty johnson into you after it's been with the other chick.  His excuse is NO excuse.  Nasty.  Sh*t belongs on Jerry Springer show.
79eBn6V8aa	wow...this happened to me too...years ago...i was in a 5 year relationship with my son's dad...he criticized me and made me feel terrible about myself...he did this so that he could keep me all to himself....it took me years to get back to myself again...hopefully you won't have to do the same...join a gym and start a weight loss plan...hopefully as you start to look better you'll start to feel better...your friends will come back around, or you'll make new ones....don't delay though...like i said..it took me years to get back to me...life is too short|`|2di0zcqkaa	its probably just hormoans with the relationship. dont be insecure about yourself. have to work on your own self worth|`|38Mdw0kUaa	the same thing happened to my mom,you just need to realize that not all men are going to be like your ex,But you should still watch your back because you never know,I think you need to find yourself a boyfriend that is like the same person that you used to be he can help  find your true being,I wish you the best of luck!|`|rMTq7yMyaa	are you sure its him whose done this to you?    or when you first dated you were so obsessed that YOU left your friends?    or was it YOU that made you "fat"?    or was it YOU that changed your personality?|`|f1i6DPHFaa	I would start calling up old friends and try to do things with them.

You should try and get back into somethings you used to be interested in such as exercising, eating healthy, contacting some old friends and catching up with them.

fqZifENVaa	My husband and I have been married 27 years. The initial all-consuming passion of first love fades after the first few years. that is not real love. It is replaced by something more deep, more beautiful, and more passionate. Marriages of many years have peaks and valleys--good times and bad. It is truly wonderful to share your life and love with your soulmate and best friend. Yes, there are times when you will be bored. But this is countered by the shared memories, love, and respect you will share together. It is sad that there are not enough examples for younger people to see and know of the joys of long-term committment to each other.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	20 years - NOT bored.  Wife is very fun.

ETV7yvNbaa	UM she shouldn't have a boyrfriend..|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	Your daughter has a boyfriend why does she have a boyfriend at nine years old. For one if she is going to a movies with a boy then I would go with them because I wouldn't want nothing to happen to my daughter.|`|BC9nPXG7aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|aWvuZJjRaa	if you go with her mabye?? but dont sit with them.  i mean, they're only nine........... right?|`|ymK1hg2Raa	that is just too young. having a boyfriend at nine years old and wanting to go on a date, that's just, not right.    if they go with a group of 8 friends and there are 5 parents, then yes that's fine.    don't let her. please, don't let her!|`|Q9cQY8Tkaa	what she's nine hell no thats to young for her to go to the movies with her bf by themselfs why dont you go with them but sit in diffrent sits like they are down the bottom and your up the top so they cant see you but you can see them if they make a move like kissing and stuff and thats ok if your with them but not by themselfs|`|6GNqMJB4aa	Well, if she wants to see a movie with him, then the "date" should be chaperoned.  You or one of his parents needs to go along on the date or maybe it could be a group outing, with some of their other friends.  I realize that she is your daughter and that you make the decisions, but at the same time, you came on here for advice so be prepared.  I would not have been allowed to go out iwht a boy at the age of 9.  Your daughter is still very young and does not know all of the consequences that goes along with even hanging out with guys.  Boys say things to their friends and sometimes exagerrate even when they know that they are lying through their teeth about what happened.  I know this because that kind of stuff happened when I was in grade school. The times change, but basic human behavior pretty much stays the same.|`|THdnS1f4aa	What movie is it?    Edit:  In that case, go for it.  You need to sit down and have "the talk" first, though.  Let her know that anything she wouldn't see on late-night Showtime is unnacceptable.    Edit  2:  When you put it on the internet, it is no longer your business.    Edit  3:  Time to come clean.  I am the one dating your daughter.|`|JYWn3lAqaa	let them go as long as it's rated 18A|`|xgJbxZgfaa	she's 9 years old- she shouldn't even have a boyfriend!!!! you're going to be a grandma by the time she turns 13, guaranteed.|`|1QlOz5wqaa	Yeah it's a appropriate movie. If you want you can sit at the end of the theatres (down seats) and they can sit at the top if you want|`|W2pU2g9Eaa	That is a really good movie, but I think you should shaperone it. I know what my bf and I did at movies and let's just say it isn't something you want your 9 year old daughter exposed to. Heck I wasn't even allowed to date guys then!!|`|81f4f4713b8cd1cf5f6b06c943840780aa	As long as an adult is present.  They are too young to go without supervision.|`|WiBOrXUCaa	Shes too young to date.  you should talk to her about this.|`|EFOBeGu4aa	Accompany her and her friend.  9 years old is way, way, way too young to be alone with a boy even in a movie.|`|0T3qOcUFaa	No wai, Jose...    How old is her boyfriend?    Edit: try hitting her|`|nz8o3lLSaa	Miyoka?|`|1keW9Dofaa	I don't think nine-year olds should have boyfriends, period.|`|gNghGb1Haa	go ahead there nine they will be more into the popcorn and the movie than each other|`|Lc6AnV6aaa	I don't think she should have a boyfriend at 9, but I'm not the parent so it shouldn't count. Anyway, yeah they can go see hotel for dogs =]|`|QqBjcZmaaa	9 years old?!?!!  um NO!|`|WQONdh1Laa	that's disgusting
561aafc6972b74f7f0530f8de80c890caa	you'll probably ha e to order it online unless u want to make it your self i would maybe buy black sweats and use yellow paint to make similar marks like bumble bee and u can probably find a transformers mask at party city or something     http://www.buycostumes.com/Transformers-...
7UIoQFKJaa	its normal to feel pain under ur breast cuz thts part of going through puberty,it means tht its expanding
YraPn46waa	He's just not that into you.    Yes, he thinks you're pretty, probably thinks lots of girls are. May have a girl of his own that you don't even know about.    You've got to look at the facts here. You're being very friendly, he has your number, he's clearly not shy if he's (ever so kindly) saying you can stop by his school, so it's clear that he's just not that bothered.    Oh maybe if you work really hard at it and he's a bit bored, and you're both a bit drunk, you might end up sleeping together. But what's the point, girl? You KNOW he's never going to call you after that night's happened.    Now if you care abou yourself at all you'll take a good, long look at why you have chosen to spend so much energy on a situation that you know - and you DO know this - is clearly going to end up hurting you. Either he'll never date you, or he'll get a bit of fun and run.     It's no reflection on you, but it will hurt and you will feel bad. Don't put yourself in this situation again. It's 50/50. If a guy won't put in his half, then think what a rotten boyfriend he'd be anyway. (And no, you won't find out, but you can certainly guess).    Move on. You can do better than this.|`|tao83sDxaa	honey he is playing you like a piano. he really doesn't care about you, it's all about him, and what makes him look and feel good. if you go to his club, don't have anything to do with him. everything in his life is about him. you don't really want to be with someone who doesn't know how to treat a girl. talk is cheap. you may like him but he is nothing but trouble, drop him and you will find someone who treats you like a lady. tell him to take a hike.|`|8cf795959f4bb56d8c730f6fc0d177dfaa	Nope not worth it.|`|Z3RFbUrDaa	he's not worth it. he's playing you. just get over him.
Yl8pOCAMaa	Wow, you're a ho, and his best friend too. Shameful.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Should you feel guilty?  My God...Yes, you should feel guilty, you should be ashamed of yourself.  Good luck explaining this one.    And...you'd hardly know the next day if you were pregnant.  Come on.  This is why 17 year old have no business being parents.|`|aY9v3SJKaa	That's what happens when your 17 get drunk and are irresponsible!    So if you just had sex last nite the go get plan B so that you dont get pregnant. You have 72 hours to take it and your time is ticking away. Then you better hope that your boyfriends friend doesnt brag to him about what a skank you were last nite. If he doesnt then hope he doesnt dump you for cheating on him. Great job!! A 17 year old drunk ****.|`|CgO5Yq6Gaa	Yes tell your bf what has happend and that you need his support right now. Be honest. Honesty always beats lies and it will be hard but you will feel much better then like this|`|mbvpWNMeaa	First, feel guilty.  You knew better than to get that drunk.    Second, be honest with your boyfriend.|`|1epjqrflaa	What do you expect to hear form people about this?? Your not only drinking to the point of doing dumb shi* but your prego?? Im sure your parents are very proud!lol Get your shi* together right now or your going to turn into another welfare mother   who is an alcoholic with no college education and 6 kids|`|etvcYfbQaa	Can I be next?  I hope the father gets to see the baby btw. Sounds like you might be needing a padlock on those knickers/panties. Try keeping them on! or Enjoy getting them ripped off. Its too easy to just get fucked isnt it? hehe. You sound like fun for just 1 night.|`|833d3998e43d4ddd7ca29670d85d6648aa	Yes you should feel guilty.  Think about how you would feel if he "got wasted, banged another chick & got her knocked up."  Unfortunately you messed up.  You have no choice but to fess-up to him.  If he finds out what you did he'll dump you pronto.  He might be furious if he catches you lying to him.  If you confess, you might have a chance to be forgiven.
M3maZgdyaa	It sounds like he said no. He wants you to stay with your mother. He does not have to let you move. The court said for you to live with mom and he agreed. Why would you want to force someone to lit you live with them? It would not be a pleasant place to live|`|kqa9VFrfaa	U and Dad need to get together and work this out. Once U R over 14 in most states U can choose who to live with. Be wise, and make careful choices. I hope your parents are not fighting over you, or trying to bribe U to go in one direction or another. Your mom loves U no matter what else is going on. Do not choose your Dad over your Mom just because U think he will be more fun, or let U get by with stuff. U will suffer for that in the long run.|`|WSlxwSlFaa	I geuss it depends if you like him. Because your quite unsure about him and if he'll want you, doesnt seem like a good guy|`|5k7BexD3aa	No, he doesn't "have" to.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	By law, unless you are eighteen, you don't get to decide where you live.  The courts decide that, which they already have.  You can tell the courts where you want to live, but you don't get to tell anybody anything.  He does not have to let you live with him.  The only way you can live with him is if either both of your parents agree to this, or if he takes your mother back to court and gets the court order changed.|`|THWHHHRWaa	no, he doesnt have to.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	He doesn't have to.  While the court takes into account the wishes of older children, if only one parent wants custody, she will keep it.  You have to talk this out with your parents.|`|tYutrD8Taa	Are you old enough to live on your own?  And why don't you straight up ask him if you can live with him?  If you're not comfortable talking to him about living with him, maybe it's not something you should do in the first place.|`|GKPY3t56aa	If he doesn't want you to live with him then you have to go with your mom.
Wo5Ezmwiaa	Awwww, well usually whenever a guy stares at you for extended periods of time it is because he likes you. Next time, try and and get in on some of that ;-) It will show him you are interested too. It can feel soo good to lock eyes with someone. Next time you pass him, look at him and don't look away.
1UlJRGoDaa	i hope so! i like your version of soulmates better :)|`|RRTDRSw1aa	Naw, always a lot of trouble, sooner or later.|`|JVPwpwYlaa	I sure hope so...had the love of my life for almost 15 years until their death in 1992...would like to think I could have another...but if not I can deal since I have some great memories.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	Yes i do -but unfortunately people try to run more than one at a time!|`|AA11899313	I think it varies between people.    There are those who are widowed and later meet another and find a new happiness.    What I have wonder about is this, 'What would happen if you were to find this new happiness ~ without being widowed...!'    I think the answer lies in honesty and integrity ....which is often not easy.    Sash.|`|70OHpjySaa	So...you're with someone who is perfect for you, good for you I'd say. Enjoy the day because tomorrow is another day.  I was with someone who was perfect for me for 25 years until he hit midlife crisis and I hit menopause then all went down the drain.    Apart my husband, who did a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde on me, I think I met several soulmates, but I was married so I did not pursue it. One was in his 50s, when I was in my 30s, one was in his 20s when I was in my 40s, it's like you have one soulmate for every generation...    I have the theory that my husband was my soulmate, my age. I already met my soulmates 20 years younger and 20 years older than me. I'm hoping to meet my soulmate 10 years younger and/or 10 years older than me (half a generation is my hope).    Where are you?|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Ahh you'll be talking about me then? Kidding.  No, i think there is a special someone for most people. That's why there's palm reading and fortune telling and all that stuff. Hope this helped. x|`|Ybhgy5A1aa	I think so (:|`|TfPDMDZMaa	I think there is only one.|`|CfdRHhgJaa	Well you may think there is 4 or 5, but i think that there are 4 or 5 people you really do love, but only 1 of them are really special and mean the most out of all of them|`|xgJbxZgfaa	i agree, i think there's more than one person, yes, but not everyone ends up with them .|`|6a572f4b6f26a4c454781621261ee067aa	yes|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	no i don't. There really ought to be a lot of compatible people out there, considering the numbers of humans on the planet.|`|jnr1Oh7Haa	mabeys......|`|POZvhqj4aa	yes sometimes you don't meet them until you almost give it up.|`|gVPASxgFaa	i hope so, because then if you do find that person or even one of them its going to be amazing but id actually think theres only one person out there who's that special someone.|`|Y086jBR0aa	i think there is one person but you have to go through many to find that person :)|`|AdhtCYQOaa	No. Love is a relationship that you have to work with, like friendship|`|5gqc5qyzaa	Humans aren't bits of lego. There's 6 billion other folk out there. thousands or millions of people have the right personality traits to be 'that special someone'. It's not romantic to think that way but it's true.|`|0ky4TktEaa	I think you have to look at people on an individual level for this question. That's like saying one person is better than someone else when better is not the right word for that. You may personally like them better because they are more compatible with you as an individual, but they doesn't make them better than someone less compatible if it's just for that reason. So yes, there are many people who could be special for you; however, i think there is only ONE person who suits you best. Trick is to find that person without settling for people who come close but never quite make it that far.|`|SrmR5iNxaa	I don't know but I would say that there's only one person. Some people will get married and find out they aren't happy then their second or third marriage will be perfect. I think God just lets the right person that he created for us fall into our life, we ust have to figure out which person that is.|`|U4EywLzSaa	No I don't think so. We only can make something special from out of what we've got. Yes, certain character traits, goals, like and dislikes must match, but even after all this it really depends on what we put into it, both your desires and efforts to make it work.|`|o5uEyrRHaa	I really don't know. I'd like to believe that there is one special person for everyone and that you are destined to be with, i suppose that's what people call 'true love'. But i also think we fall in love more than once in our lives, and these people are also important but in a different way. I think if you find 'the one' then it feels different. I'm just commenting on general opinions not first hand experience, unfortunately  (",)|`|XW0gqnJIaa	i think there are many people and it is up to you to choose the one you feel suits you the best|`|bdb9e39d00f74941570c5077bddd04a8aa	yeah, it's Me.      I'm pretty special, and I'm willing to share the awesome with everyone.|`|7tqMuBSVaa	I think there are more than one person for everyone, but i do think there are soul mates who you'll find unless they are with the wrong person. x|`|2di0zcqkaa	I use to think so but im not sure anymore.ive been married to her for 8 years and before we were maried i thought she was the one.  i think after time people get to many grudges agaist each other.  i do have the best things in life thow. she is 5 and ne is 2|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Logically speaking, I dont believe there's just "one person" for someone.  I think it depends on the individual's personality, some people may be attractive to and work well with many different types of people but others arent everyone's cup of tea.  Think I'm the latter lol, I have too many quirks!|`|8aFOSlHWaa	sure|`|a19Z5rwLaa	Absolute not, that's some grade school Disney BS they pump into little girls head's to make them not have sex and save it for their future husband.  You can always do better.|`|Ka6PjecVaa	It is said we were told so by the Bible.|`|CaKu7gbAaa	you are right like parents or some best friends can be special but one special person can be life partner who will love you truly forever and will stand by you through thick and thin and you can rely upon him at every point. he and you can owe your life for each other, and would love to share every moment with him, thats the most special person in life.|`|JZt4Yu76aa	I hope so!|`|Prm2Uq00aa	We'll never know.
TfPDMDZMaa	Probably so! Let us know what becomes of it. =)|`|xP08melDaa	LOL... He definitely likes u but u should play hard to get for  a lil more time... make him ask u out and not vice versa so it looks like hes desperate and not u...|`|AA11263103	You can tell if a guy likes you if he:  stares at you, smiles at you, tries to talk to you, laughs and makes jokes with you, then yeah he likes you.  1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will mos|`|M3CsxF2jaa	yes|`|KVHtWENnaa	You should talk to him :)|`|7VMLssSnaa	Try talking to him and flirt with him.  And if he does it back, YES! (:  Smile at him and wave.|`|61JY1dpQaa	maybe but is he a flirt or anything?|`|aWvuZJjRaa	how can you "REALLY LIKE HIM!!!" when you dont even know him.  and yes, i do think he likes you.... duhhh|`|bj5Hq83uaa	awwwwwwwwwwwww! thats so cute lol. i say yes!!!!!!!! yes yes yes!!!|`|uxzLX8fRaa	he probably does|`|IqDNqYo6aa	he definitely likes u...oh u have something on ur face....lol...but he likes u|`|NXv6NKjDaa	he probably does, but is really shy, and is just wishing you would talk to him!   or he could just be a creep, but i doubt thats it   best bet, he likes you lots girl!   =D|`|6g4RcrYIaa	how old are you? just ask him. im sure he does but does it really madder if all you guys are doing is staring at eachother?|`|syitFmPvaa	yes he likes you try talking to him if you have lunch with him sit at his table and talk. is he he shy? and wants you to talk to him first.  good luck =]|`|Zf3mUGvYaa	Omg like totally let him hit it a few times.

KjzsYV9uaa	sounds alittle weird..
HvnFTNmCaa	I was shut up like a rose, the scar of my heart...  How I wanted her to rise up with the clouds.......  How I was without for love, received the wounds on cheek,    The nights empty sleep, hopeless words I can't keep    She searched just like a magnet, the metal is me...    How I needed her to draw it in, protect me from belief  How I pleaded then to end again, heal my rotting skin    pleaded then, asked for sin,  something I can keep    Soul of my soul, do you feel me?  Touch the beating, heart of my heart  Flesh of my flesh  Mouth of my mouth...    I was shuned by others like disease, the feathers in my eyes  How I need her light to purify the darkness deep inside  How I asked for warmth, received snow and sleet,  the burns on my feet,  white and unsoiled sheets    She reached for all my desire, kept her hands out towards me  How my mind built high could rectify such pain and deceit  How the sorrow plunged, concrete and ashen weeps  The porous bed it reeks with unresolved peeks    Love is the Law,  Love Under Will...|`|855bpb3Caa	Yes i have.|`|Prm2Uq00aa	Like you see someone and your insides scream?    yes.       not love though.|`|pQGUPITeaa	I don't think that's love.|`|RQrFOF14aa	Everything is possible.|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	i did once, but alas it was not meant to be...|`|PANwlcLJaa	Yes it happens to me all the time but all the chicks love me anyway(Sometimes I believe in myself too much)|`|eX7An0AKaa	Well considering i met my husband online.. yeah. :)|`|A2ehaXONaa	Yes I am and have been for quite some time. It is a feeling of completeness, happiness, fulfillment, and a never ending feeling of hopes and dreams. I know one day we will meet. Patience though can be the enemy, it is hard to fight off at times.
hNRF5agXaa	To be completely honest i would. I feel like an outcast but i would but only if he had done something to hurt me. or was with another girl  or talking to another girl you know?

I am better then that. (:     I don't "plan" to make him jelous,  He plans to make ME jelous.

cdQryr7paa	I know exactly what your talking about.<br>  A guy that is that shy, is scared. He is afraid of being rejected, and if rejected, it would ruin your friendship because there would be an ackwardness there that wasn't before.<br>  You need to speak, tell him how you feel, and he will reply.<br>  Just understand, if you want to move from a friendship, to a relationship, there is no turning back after it's done.<br>  That kind of shyness means he doesn't have alot of romantic experience with girls, so you will have to help him.|`|c42ce7dca0e4db7c90a5a319d3ea57b1aa	I am a shy guy around lasses I like, but in other circumstances I am not shy.<br>  <br>  I have always gone down the normal route of asking the lass if she wanted to go out somewhere, cinema, drink, something to eat and gauged it from there.<br>  <br>  If I thought there was something there then I would make an attempt to get to know her better, (numerous ways).<br>  <br>  And once I got to know her I would ask her out.<br>  <br>  Also I think traditionally guys should ask the girls out but I think its fine for girls to make the first move, especially if your giving off mixed signals which I know alot of lasses do.|`|3cc78d6f4c03ea9291c7cc68c4f972ceaa	It's not always that a guy goes for d first move.Just go ahead and ask him directly"Do u like me?".Since u r not a shy girl i believe u'll do it.<br>  BEST OF LUCK !|`|5PDPJMlYaa	You both just need to be comfortable with eachother. <br>  Once the friendship is at the level where you two can call eachother anytime, talk to eachother, and approach eachother without being afraid, it is a GREAT friendship and can turn out to be wonderful relationships if you both tell eachother how you feel!<br>  <br>  I was this way with a girl but dude!!! when we got close and became good friends it was amazing! it was fun and we hung out alot and went places. I liked her and stuff and told her but yea it was complicated and I was a little young. But thinking back, i wouldn't have thought it wouldve lasted but hey, life goes on and you'll find the special someone<br>  <br>  =D|`|5b77077e70b84dab7414213e14225d32aa	Could be a fear thing.  Has he ever had a girlfriend?  If he hasn't then he may be unsure or lack confidence.  Best if you take the initiative and gently suggest that you wish to take the relationship further.  Watch his reaction closely, this will indicate where you stand.  Dont push it if he is reluctant - it will affect the friendship in a negative way.  Good luck.|`|fa55f623dfe6fa800b8a0416caf753eaaa	yeah<br>  why are you asking?|`|95293948038fe12583e7686e0332eb3faa	i definitely am :)|`|U25y5I83aa	Based on my own experience, im a shy guy to someone i like, but the best thing that made "us click" is that she just hold my hands and thats it. Intelligent people need no explenation on body language as well. I've been asked too som'like "do you want me?" i was embarrassed though but i did say 'yes, and a lot!'|`|qfYCU033aa	just call him up and talk on the phone one night and tell him that you are interested in him and want to take your relationship to the next level and hang out more one on one and then he will get the message
qyjXWCA0aa	No it was better, a no pressure hang out with a friend.  If you like her ask her on a date now, if it didnt really work out for you then just roll with it, no worries.    If it was a date I hope you'd spring for more then a swap meet...|`|ASLbRwQ8aa	...      WOW.      sloooooooooooooow  ........|...  ........|..........2points ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|TfPDMDZMaa	Yes|`|UBN2Crr3aa	ya it could be|`|RETpCHipaa	sounds like a date but it could have just been friends hanging out. ask her to go out tomorrow night if she says yes then that will be more like a date. usually you go on dates at night.|`|pQGUPITeaa	Yep sounds like a date to me.
5e9354aa1dba73aa34a01e3b6d2ffcc8aa	You don't want to jeopardize his teaching career.  You shouldn't say anything unless the professor makes the first move.  If he makes the first move, then he's voluntarily putting his career on the line then.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	I'm sure you're not the first, and I can guarantee you won't be the last girl to get herself worked up over him. Don't do anything- it's unethical on his part, and possible against school policy.|`|AA11328507	Leave it alone|`|0070ba6b4d411e4f950988e769591459aa	wait until you don't have classes with him and graduate!

Don't do something that is going to get one or both of you in trouble.  <br>  <br>  Second, assuming no problem with the first thing, just come and tell him.  If he does like you, he may be concerned about making any overt moves, for fear that he will get in trouble.  If he doesn't, assuming you don't act like a love struck teenager, he may he come to respect you a little more for your mature attitude.  <br>  <br>  You may strike out, you may hit a home run, but if you don't step up to the plate, you'll never know. (sorry, hope you understand the baseball metaphor:)  )|`|AA12260362	don't do it he could lose his job over it.|`|b0ebf706d8c01c3696680c4adc953d8eaa	wait to see if he will make a move on you....
13300fd67512c34cb8f9670d59521b40aa	Apologies never make one look stupid. Being repentant for an infraction of friendship should not be a deal breaker. Asking for forgiveness should begin the process of reconciliation. If this person is not open to apology or reconciliation you should move on to a more appropriate friendship. To have friends you must be a friend. Sometimes friendship is letting go.|`|b493caa427317263d70ed82e7d49512eaa	Write her note and slip it in her mailbox.  Leave the rest up to fate.  I think she'll forgive you eventually, but it's going to take some time for her to get over it.  Give each other some space and wait for the dust to settle.  She'll talk to you eventually but she's not going to do it while she's still mad.  Write her a note and hope for the best.  It's going to take time so be patient.|`|27e2080123a506f81bbcd4790563f230aa	if she can't see past something stupid and accept your apology then you don't need her as a friend|`|4be577b5ff677b4940fc40555042549baa	write her a note and hope she reads it...... and if u have to just say i know i did something wrong but im sorry so try to forgive me|`|d08081cc6cd56700efab32c46a357d31aa	Tell your friend that you are really sorry and that you mean it with all your heart. Tell her that you knew it was stupid to do and that you wish you havent done it. Be truthful to her. If she still doesnt want to talk give her a couple days to cool off. Im sure she will soon realize that u really didnt mean it and that you might even laugh about it later on. =] Good Luck.
265b11b627bfa7ddae7150d000efeb40aa	ummm YEA she wants you!  Sounds like she could be a lil flirty though touching the other guys and you.  But most likely if you are touched more she likes you best....hehehe!  Like maybe she is trying to not make it obvious by touching them too but if you are getting it more then I think you should like hit on here be like lets go to lunch today...hehehe!!  Good luck hope ya get her or some ; )|`|00adf0e2a1868a7488b491fa6a6c2fe3aa	That's probably her way of flirting with guys... Just tell her not to touch you so much unless she's gonna back it up... She thinks shes teasing you but its annoying when they do it to much... tell her to back off or bend over... she'll stop touching you after that comment.|`|1f8e8ef85115e63707abcc555b6e869eaa	I think she likes you and that's a way that she is using to flirt with you. She might justt like getting your attention. Or maybe she is just very friendly and she jus like to touch people. I touch on the guy that I am attracted to. I do it to let him know that I like him and to get his attention. I don't really touch guys  that I don't like.|`|62781038683284ebc6addf47866c7876aa	There's not enough information here for anything other than speculation.<br>  <br>  Some people are just very affectionate and demonstrative.  They talk with their hands a lot and express their feelings through touch.<br>  <br>  Culturally, if she is from a different culture, this is completely normal for some.<br>  <br>  Maybe she actually *does* like you, and this is her way of flirting.<br>  <br>  If you don't like it, tell her to stop.|`|6f0d4f95ea7a0844e7e8f74ffc7cd9edaa	shes a hoe|`|921426fcc11f94cfd1c2dbb9fde1f106aa	Sounds as if she's close to humping your leg....  yikes!|`|d06be0ae7f1fb3fa8a6a2c53699749bcaa	ask her whats wrong with her haha nah joax um just ignore it try and keep away from her|`|d8054b2e8c29a18d0130367a8d5ea136aa	sometimes they are just looking for attention, or maybe they want to feel pretty... or they just really need a boyfriend and they need to get it out of their system? Just deal with it, but if it makes you uncomfortable just tell her that you don't like to be touched.<br>  <br>  some girls are just really touchy, and flirt with everyone|`|3b5c48a17dba701eb92b7928512e5015aa	she's like my friend, she wants attention from guys, ask her if she had a real good relationship wit her dad or not and u might figure it out|`|9481b6547b6525862e4823c98091af6caa	Some people connect really well and like to express that physically. I would love to find a "touchy/feely" girl cuz then there'd be no confusion. If they hug you, they like you. That's that. Its better than having to "read minds" and interpret body language and all that. Its a sign of true friendship and companionship.

If you feel that it shows you little respect and puts you down, then you should talk to her about it. If it really bothers you, then she should love you enough to make an effort to watch what she says. If it doesn't bother you, then no harm no foul.|`|8902bfa486901af4288e7c760e52f970aa	I always say dork, but I always tell people that it's more of an endearment coming from me then anything meant to be mean spirited or hateful, but I'd recon you'd say it could be seen as the same differance.

i15KoiJhaa	Not a Man.... BUT    LOL    I think Amy Whinehouse is very talented.  I think she has the potential to be attractive but it's hard to be attractive when you're so damn drunk and high you can't smack your butt with 2 hands....    And I have no idea about her acting ability or lack off...but feel pretty certain it would be next to impossible to remember your lines when you're to busy doing lines.    They tried to make me go to rehab, I said no, no, no....    LOL I think the lyrics in her case should have been they tried to make me go to rehab AGAIN.

dbc3874a12a783cc8b8498d47b3deb74aa	Tu sais le préservatif féminin présente de nombreux avantages :<br>  Il est plus solide que le préservatif masculin, il est donc moins sujet aux déchirures éventuelles ; <br>  Il peut être mis en place longtemps avant le rapport (jusqu’à plusieurs heures), ce qui n’interrompt pas les préliminaires ; <br>  Il prolonge l’intimité, puisqu’il n’est pas nécessaire de le retirer aussit?t après éjaculation. Et ne comprime pas le sexe masculin.<br>  Il permet une meilleure sensation tactile.<br>  Et il faut savoir qu'il n'est pas en latex donc pas d'allergies !! <br>  <br>  D’un point de vue plus pratique, il procurerait une sensation de propreté, le sperme restant à l’intérieur.

The first time you go out with someone you should get to know them a little and not worry about anything else.|`|add61e7f392d967df0fd959ed324c63baa	If you are interested in him, you are definitely wondering that.

ba808642a0667193fc002c2bbda18db5aa	At least you know what you don't want.  Good for you.  There's nothing to be gained by compromising in this situation.  In the event he corners you at some point in time, prepare in advance as to what you can say to him about how you feel.  You could repeat some of the things you said about him in your question, that you consider him to be a nice man, that it is just a friendship as far as you are concerned, that you didn't agree to forge a life partnership and don't know why he assumed the same, that you feel you're too young (or whatever) to make such a serious committment at this time, etc.  Good Luck|`|fafd251369944fbdae87f04d1595affeaa	Why don't you just come out and tell the poor guy you aren't interested.

I hate when people dont answer the phone routine...thats just crappy.
29fb98f5c28a7129bc22e83e27449a1faa	Depending on your age... I would say, it is SOMEWHAT normal.  <br>  <br>  When you are younger and beginning to go through adolescence.. you are learning about all of these emotions - who is cute, what you like in a boyfriend / girlfriend... etc.<br>  <br>  As you grow up, and begin to experience all of this, you look at other people around you and decide what you like and what you don't.  Often times, those people are cousins.... they are around you the most.<br>  <br>  With that being said... if you are seriously looking at a cousin whom you are interested in... I would take a step back, and find someone OUTSIDE your family to start a relationship with.<br>  <br>  It is normal to think someone your age is cute... but if they are in your family - you need to make sure to keep your distance!<br>  <br>  As you get older - your group of friends will get larger, and you need to focus on those people that are NOT related to you to get into relationships with!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|96ec395c1c89c0aa6daedafd75e31f10aa	Back in the day... and i'm talking hundreds, not thousands of years ago... consanguine marriages (marriage between 3° relatives = cousins) was not only common, it was the rule. People like people that are like themselves. <br>  <br>  There is nothing in the Bible that says it's wrong. <br>  <br>  However, the problem is more of biology. Consanguine marriages have a greater likelihood of resulting in children with birth defects. This is due to the inheritance of what are called recessive alleles (gene, that will not express unless they are inherited from both parents). So if you and your cousin are carring one defective gene and one good gene, and you both give one bad gene to your kid --> inherited disorder.  (We see inherited recessive disorder a lot in Eastern European Askenazi Jewish population.) <br>  <br>  Lastly, because this society frowns on 3° relationships... you'll have to deal with that.|`|K8KUwTJ0aa	No that would be PERVIRTED!!!!!!|`|AA12226108	ew no!|`|6fab959502d2591cc6cf18b6a0df55f9aa	no and don't give it another thought|`|072c799a19024caf47cbb8698aadd1e4aa	Depends, how do you feel about raising kids with flippers?|`|180d609426efbd3281e057f0cc3fcde4aa	Only freaks do that!|`|e1fe6f13947922ae4d95bce3340f2344aa	No i have not.

be4b3f0e27e596c6d61424987597b37baa	ABSOLUTELY NOT You did the right thing 100%~ and not often I can say that. C'mon so you liked each other...you'll look back on this experience in Chile..(which btw ..I am soo jealous) and you'll remember how much life you lived visiting other places. Look...you two can get together somewhere down the line. It's not your fault she chose an ******..but even better for you..cuz when you get back that will only put you higher up on the "good guys to date" list..... Loooook...you would totally have regretted staying for this chic..and always wondering about Chile!!!! Woohoo!!! Have fun!!!|`|84611b819bed6043429b44978091fc18aa	You shouldn't be guilty because its not your fault that she was attracted to the other guy. Also, if you guys are really meant to be, then whatever happens, you'll be together. Who knows, maybe after a year, you'll both realize that you guys are soulmates ^_^|`|99975bccc07a5fc221e0fc577516b454aa	She's just reminding you of what you left.<br>  she had to get on with her life (as i suppose you did in the year you were away)<br>  as for the guilt.............<br>  no you shouldnt feel guilty<br>  Time to pick yourself up and move on<br>  good luck|`|cdf03d2a53395372e8fbc79a35b94249aa	ok you were a complete jackass...tell her that your sorry 4 it and mayb she will stop trying 2 make u feel guilty. thats her plan 2 make u feel guilty and then 4 u 2 ask her out and she will dump the other dude straight away...she's just trying to make you feel guilty..and its working by the looks of it|`|ea9a72f9d11485cb9c599ed8956fd7eeaa	i feel bad for u but it's not ur fault that u left!! well u wanted to!! but when u get back there will be another girl who is perfect and ull realize that it wasnt meant to be and if youd've gone out with the girl ur talking about, u wouldve never met the perfect girl for u!! there are many fish in the sea and one of them is perfect for u|`|ecca231172acd527d3a4e735307cb905aa	no dear.. you are a nice guy. she should feel proud of you..|`|c6f7c74201c09f6bb1d53a7c57e57e06aa	Lol, she really wants you man! Just steal her back when you get back. It's probable|`|7feb8fc498fef949d992f30b65bbcb39aa	She's playing with you and not being considerate that you're far away, something that she was aware would happen. Consider that she is showing a character flaw that will only make your life harder if you become involved with her. You are being given a gift though you may not realize it: someone with whom you could have become intimate and given much of yourself to has taken off the mask and shown what she is really like. Enjoy your experience in Chile. You will not return the same person. You will look back on this exchange program as something that greatly enriched your life, changed your perspective on things, brought you new friends and new feelings--and this girl will only be a little blip on the screen of her life. Leave her to herself and her (temporary) new found love, and don't allow yourself to be emotionally manipulated. Good luck.|`|0bc2cd03674288e97fed2684d16ca10eaa	No. Listen you wanted to do this, so you should have. You didn't do anything wrong. She will date you when you get back.|`|77fee0ad1f690baf9e078ef624eb4f35aa	You shouldn't feel guilty. Going to Chile is an experience that can't be duplicated or repeated. This girl shouldn't be trying to make you feel bad for making a positive move in your life. I could understand if you had a relationship going, you left for Chile and now things are getting complicated. But that was not the case right? So, although I don't want to water-down your feelings for this young lady, you should concentrate on your time in Chile and not lament on what you can't change. You're already gone and she already has a man! Enjoy your time and be proud of yourself! I wish I were in Chile! It's winter over here!|`|876d1eeabec47ce68ca4350bd5b92c84aa	Finish your school and go for it man!!! Good luck!|`|b65e3d75e305da0e5ba9051fb9e564c1aa	You shouldn't feel guilty at all. It's all on her. If she really liked you then she would have waited for you. So it's her fault not yours. I would tell her that. If I was you I would forget about her. I mean once you do go back home to see her and if she does decided to date you and break it off with this jackass who's to say she's not going to cheat on you or not wait for you again. If something happened that you had to go away again for any reason. Do you really think after what she has just done that she will wait for you and not move on to the next guy and later on say that it was all your fault again. No screw that. She would expect you to wait on her. What's the difference. All I'm saying is maybe you should think about it. Good Luck. And remember everything will work out in the end. It always does.
27e177a2c5693ab8765e4b4e3593d5e7aa	You don't want to be w/someone who needs/needed saving. TRUST ME....I did the very same thing-passed up a GREAT guy-SAME situation....my life was a living hell.  He was just fine in the beginning but all his promises and changes didn't last.  We ended up getting divorced 8 yrs later after co-existing as merely roommates rather than a married couple for 5 of those years- it was NO way to live.<br>  <br>  If you have somebody in your live now who is "healthy" for you and you are happy with, you enjoy your time together, he is grounded and safe....my God-stay with that man!  Why would you want to go back to all that drama?<br>  <br>  Anything that is "meant to be" should NOT start out with all that bad history already...you will end up resenting him to the point your blood feels like it's poisoned, and he will constantly try to enforce the fact that "you're not the boss and he doesn't need saving"<br>  Please...stay in what is healthy for you, you will be so much better off.....mentally, physically and emotionally.<br>  You've already helped and worried about him, it didn't matter to him when it should have....it's time for you to help and worry about YOURSELF><br>  Tons of Love!|`|AA10733221	Stay with the new man!  If he's so great, I can't understand why you would even consider going back to the old.  Be good to yourself, and stay with what truly has made you happy.  Good luck!|`|AA11305351	All I needed to read was "settle for commitment"! That's enough right there to tell you what you need to know. Are you willing to be "settled for"? Stay with the new guy. He sounds great to me, and is not "settling" for you....he loves your company!|`|ba808642a0667193fc002c2bbda18db5aa	The decisions of yours to make and you'll return to your old flame if that is your true desire, but your 'new guy' sounds more promising to me.  Your old flame said that he would 'settle for committment' not that he wanted to do so.  He still wants to keep his options open and misses parts of the relationships as you do.  However, you may have developed some 'co-dependency' qualities while in your previous relationship and your emotional heartstrings are still being pulled.  You seem proud of what you call an 'accomplishment' that you persuaded him to quit drinking.  If he really is an alcoholic he will still be one if you return.  Keep in mind that all the same 'baggage' will still be present.  I think you should consider starting fresh with the new guy and figure out what is actually best for you.  You can still hold on to your fond memories of your previous boyfriend and realize that was a time of growth, but the new guy might actually want the same things as you do w/o feeling like he's 'settling' or making you feel guilty for all that he has 'given up for you.'  Good luck w/making the right choice.|`|5f1fa8df857e80b4e3d3c90f9f0e8874aa	wow-i have been in your same spot-i was with someone who treated me horrible, and then i met the one guy who treats me like a princess. at some point you need to decide do you want to be treated like crap or be together on his time schedule? go for the new guy. i did and its wonderful. have things your way for a change-stop worrying about what everyone else wants and focus on what you want.|`|70935d53ec2e9609addf12afecbb2d23aa	stay with the new one the old one will only go back to his old self if he gets you back|`|b2e5c6fbd4f2b0d9b8d40a06dfff861faa	Go for the guy who has done nothing to hurt you.  If a guy hurts you once then he will do it again.  If you have convinced him to do better things with his life that is wonderful, but that dosen't mean you are committed to him.  He should be thankful for what you have done for him and move on.|`|f8e5d692c81d0cbf764838835a7f6e53aa	He is only wanting you now because you are off limits to him.  Because you and your attention has been taken by another.  I wouldn't be surprised if you got back with him and got rid of the other guy and he went back to the same old set up.  <br>  Let him go.  Especially if you think you have possibly found THE man.  <br>  You can sit around waiting on someone to come around.  You have to move on.  He waited until things have passed and your heart has moved on to another.  Sometimes we wait until our moment has passed and we can't get it back, his moment with you has passed and he has lost it and his lesson will be next time if he has a sense that the girl is the one to grab hold and don't let go.  But that is his lesson.<br>  Are you going to give up the possible MR. Right that you have wanted just to let him put you on hold for a wedding date until he is ready.  If he kept you waiting for the GF title imagine how long you will wait for marriage with him.........<br>  MOVE ON!<br>  WAIT NO MORE!!!!|`|xHGBrZezaa	He wants you back so bad because he cant have you.... the minute you go back to him he will go back to the way he was...

4c7ca79b729507b166c8ac798252cd14aa	No, it's only awkward in your mind.  You are the one putting mental restrictions on this.  You cannot foresee how anyone is going to react to anything, you can only foresee how you think they will react.  If you want this person than go for it.  What are you afraid of?  What if he says no?  So what?  He'll have passed up something good and you'll still be friends and you'll be a little hurt for a while but the hurt goes away and you'll find someone else.  That is the worst that could happen.  If you don't go for it, you'll never know though and not knowing because you didn't go for it should be an arrestable crime and we'll have to have the "WImp Police" come and take you away.  Be strong, fix in on what you want and go for it!  If he has had the chance to ask you out again and hasn't and he's still your friend, he's probably just as scared and nervous as you are and I bet he's thinking almost the exact same thing,  "Will it make her feel weird if I ask her out again?  I don't want to make her uncomfortable.  Whimper whimper, whine whine"  Guys are stupid like that too, so you are not alone :)  Be brave, be strong and be bold and get what is rightfully yours girl and don't look back!|`|ec1c2fa4c47f11b86b1fca27489625f0aa	No,I don't think so,if he has Feelings for you,but he may not?|`|922d47b2f4cef80931090217f00652d6aa	no.what the hell, go for it.

f49148fffa362c09051438c7fd93af01aa	Love - to me - is when you are both mad for each other - can't keep your hands off each other - don't like spending a day apart<br>  It happens - when you meet someone that you 'click with' and then next thing it's years/months later and your together<br>  You will know it!  It will hit you between the eyes one day!|`|ad4e76e7d3061a9556de108b9fc1d471aa	thats a tough question but all i can do is tell you that i am in love right now and i know because,1 i cant stop thinking about this person2 when i talk to him my entire body feels different kind of like refreshed3 when i look into his eyes i seem to get lost, forget about everything but him4 i get that butterflies in the stomach feeling5 even when i am on the phone or messenger w/ him i cant stop smiling:) 6 he makes me feel good about myself7 even when i am sick, its like he has this power that makes me feel better at least for a little bit.8 when we kiss i feel like i am in slow motion and can hear our hearts beating9 the chemistry is so strong it is almost unbelievable|`|7a44290d602ce8f1c9e22e85b2ff9412aa	love is when you feel this unbearable attraction to someone where you want to be around them a lot of the time and want to hold them and want only the best for them|`|8b59b8e8956b8d95d04e793eb2b64e20aa	Love is your bodies release of chemicals that can cause sweaty palms, heart pounding or fluttering, butterfly's in the stomach or many other reactions..theres a deep warmth and comfort you might feel to and think about this person not on a obsessive level but a warm comfort level all day long.  Love and lust are similar feelings but in the long run will sort it out...  Love is a strong emotion...it is hard to miss...|`|AA11092866	i think no one can describe this strange feeling called love . but i'll try so when u love someone u admire every thing in him his personality , his look & every thing & deny his disadvantages . you fell that u want to attract his attention and want to make him yours.<br>  yes love is woderful feeling when the both love each other but its agreat problem if one of them doesnt love the other|`|ebbe629e7936031aedb3c7e9db62f7c6aa	I have two answers for this question:<br>  <br>  Philosophically, Love is the connection two people have when they know each other and devote each other to making the other happy. In the romantic sense it's what keeps couples together and makes marriages last decades.<br>  <br>  Biologically, love (notice that I did not capitalize it) is a general feeling of happiness that occurs when one is around somebody they are extremely fond of. Usually, romantic love occurs when the two people involved are highly attracted to each other, but does not happen instantly.<br>  <br>  Biologically speaking, regardless of how love or (more commonly, lust) feels, it is a biological response that evolved to enforce pair bonding. It makes you less likely to leave someone to avoid being a parent (quite taxing for a species that is inherently lazy) which would otherwise occur.<br>  <br>  As far as how it happens?<br>  <br>  Meet somebody you like. Find out that they like you. Find out that they are highly compatible with you. That is the generic recipe for love.<br>  <br>  As far as you knowing it?<br>  <br>  Let your brain handle this one. The feeling you get first that usually lasts about a month that feels like love is actually lust. It's the best feeling in the world for about a month. Then it will usually go away for a while.<br>  <br>  If you're really fond of the person you won't notice that the lust went away until somebody mentions it. Other times, it'll be like "whoa, where'd it go?".<br>  <br>  In my experience, the way I tell if I'm in love is to hold off on even saying "I love you" regardless of if I mean it or not for the first two months. After that, I say it to myself as if saying it to the girl I'm with. If it feels right, I'll find a romantic way to tell her (last one was at the Santa Monica Pier in Southern California).|`|AA11748373	If you feel nausea then it is either love or the flu. It can only be one or the other.
9be6374e78d68c69f3c0e6a68f547775aa	Because opposites attract?<br>  <br>  Actually, I've heard of both genders being called "hot" when they are sexy and "cool" when they are socially adept. The two are not the exact same thing. <br>  <br>  But it probably depends on where you live...|`|AA11200878	to distinguish them from nerds and dogs!!!|`|c4302449c70d5bea6cb2db42dcbac390aa	I think of "Cool" to mean; with it and savvy and yes it seems to be used more in reference to guys. <br>  Like Fonzie was so cool<br>  "Hot" is a phrase we seem to use for both guys and girls.<br>  Johnny Depp is definitely HOT as is Scarlett Johansson.

I promise she'll love it because its thoughtful and creative and she'll know you had to put fourth effort.|`|46665c357798b319e84d69534398b6f7aa	There's nothing more priceless than a boyfrinend's unconditional love for his girlfriend.|`|623416f3398312ee158e188fdbd3d0d6aa	set up the room with candles chocolates and flowers, it would be perfect!|`|AA11187223	It depends how old she is on what she likes.. but flowers are always a good idea and most of the time so is chocolate XD|`|f8d4cae714307a0a3164daf34a9bd1f1aa	I am not a girl, but I am a real romantic. First, chocolate and flowers are nice, but what you really want to do is show her that this is the beginning of a new change in the relationship.<br>  Do you give her massages? Everyone talks about it, but most never give really good long massages. Check out some books. There are also simple massage rollers to make sure your hands can survive. Believe me, they can get REALLY sore. I give massages to my wife all the time, and she really loves them. I use a thing that sort of looks like a ball with four legs, with each leg ending in a little ball. They really help work out all the tight muscles. Remember that it's easy to get carried away, but you must focus on her. If you do, you really get an unlimited amount of brownie points.<br>  Some things to remember are...<br>  Keep it simple and relaxing. If you do it right, you don't have to hurt her to relax her muscles. Shiatsu massage is usually a bad idea. The kind that talks around rubbing in small circles or stroking is great. The most important areas are the back, shoulders, neck and legs. Doing the hands and feet are great, but practice on the other areas first. TRY not to tickle. It's so easy not to if you are using a warm oil and your hands are warm.<br>  Try it, it just might be the best Valentine's Day gift she has ever gotten. My wife will pull out all the massage oils and everything and lay on the bed and complain about how hard her day is just so I will give her a massage. She will often fall asleep, but she really gives me a great thank you later.|`|4ac0d1d5a1d6d04a9f5535088c872a01aa	make her a candle lit dinner. with rose peddles and candles leading to the bed and have a bottle of wine for her. she will love it.
14ff6f3b709e794f421c5f9b050616f2aa	I HAVE MET A MILLION OF EM SWEETIE!  First of all, its all a game.. men like to hunt for their prey.. they look for the challenge.. not saying your easy as in sexual easy.. but they don't like things to be just honky dorie.. if you know what I am saying.. Am I saying is it worth the heartache or worth playing the game with them? NOOOOO... When you meet your soulmate one day, games will be forgotten and he will be ready to settle down.. most men like your dealing with are just out to be out.. they are not ready to settle down and find the one.. but.. i will tell you that some men like that are ready to settle down but they are scared of committment... I have had 2 great men in my life do the same exact thing to me one 6 months and one 1 year relationship.. to this day.. they will tell you they screwed up.. they were scared of committment and ran away from a wonderful woman.. don't let it get you down because it is not you.. if he is not giving you the time of day, he is not worth it anyway.. regardless of "how sweet he WAS"  some men put on a show to get what they want.. then when they get what they want they don't want it anymore... keep your head up .. let love come to you.. it will happen naturally.. wish you the best of luck!|`|006c41c08a90d8a86c82bfc81d0c5fa9aa	Some men are just players.  They like the chase and hunt and once they've got you, they don't want you.  Only thing you can do is move on and try picking better next time.  There are some signs, too attentive, calling too many times a day, etc.  Good luck with future non-players.|`|2557c5322aebd3f56d4531fd642a0364aa	Sadly, men play games like this because... they can.<br>  <br>  Men LOVE the chase.

This is who he is... and he's probably torturing some other woman right now with the same behavior.<br>  <br>  Be glad he's gone.

They want to see how long it takes for you to wear down and then the thrill ( so to speak ) is gone. I've been on both sides of this and let me tell you, it can be awful on both sides. Basiclly, the chase is over and the guy moves on to the next female he spots.|`|d7792c10eeba75f0be3e44b03a55c79eaa	I think there are too many disgruntled females on this board who have been hurt.<br>  <br>  Not all men are into this "so called hunt for prey".<br>  Not all Men are not predators.<br>  <br>  I have done the 2 girlfriend thing. it wasnt because of i "love to hunt for woman."<br>  <br>  The simple answer is I was Greedy.<br>   Alot of men are just simply greedy. One woman is not enough they must have another. They dont get everything that they look for in one woman so they feel they must have two or three.<br>  <br>  While doing that they can forget about you at around the same time you do become intrested.<br>  <br>  Alot of men feel they deserve to have it all exactly the way they want it. Some unfortunately never realize that this can never happen.<br>  <br>  Thats all it is. Greed.<br>  <br>  Not all men are greedy some really do become disintrested in you. <br>  <br>  it could be that you took to long to be intrested.<br>  If a female is not intrested in me at first and then all of sudden becomes intrested that is like a warning sign to be cautious.|`|a35e810d54aa4819dfec2f46518b74c9aa	It may not be a game, some people just tend to run out of conversation, was it 50/50 or did one of you do most of the talking?|`|13300fd67512c34cb8f9670d59521b40aa	There could be issues of which you are unaware -- besides just playing games.<br>  <br>  Then too, you could have been getting played like a deck of cards.|`|0473923d8e67a141fdb4b288bf963fd2aa	Some of them do.

Both sexes do and there are a couple of obvious reasons:<br>  1.  Once they get to know you, they realize you aren't "right" for them.<br>  2.  During the initial dating process they meet someone who seems better.<br>  3.  They aren't interested in a long-term relationship and you are acting "too committed" for their comfort.<br>  4.  They love the satisfaction of having someone new want them and care about them as it feeds their ego.<br>  <br>  It's true that men are traditionally "hunters" and certainly some guys are "players" but I suspect most of the break-ups that occur fall into one of those four non-sexist reasons for relationship failure.|`|d418ee0c23e5e0105fbaa33395145263aa	I don't do this

Overly aggressive pigs like that are usually all brawn no brain. Jealous of everything. They run in a pack formation, making themselves feeling untouchable, and tend to take out their aggressive behaviour on anyone they see as weaker. Anyone they know who will back down. Making them feel more powerful.<br>  You don't have to be a body builder to kick ***. Wait until the guy comes in close and ram your open fist into his nose. Get ready for a gusher. Blood will spurt and you might even break his nose. Hurts like a bugger. Blinds him for a few seconds. <br>  Drop to a knee, and ram a closed fist into his groin. He is going to go down. If he grabs you from behind, reach back, and grab those berries. Twist them off. He'll let go.<br>  If he doesn't reach up and stick your fingers in his nostrels (gross I know) and yank. It works on the mighty bull, right? If he has a nose ring, all the better. Tear it out.<br>  Slam your fists into his ears. I mean the fatty side of your hands when clutched in a fist. With the thumbs out. The less you have to hurt yourself, the better. <br>  Thumbs in the eyes, but that is usually only when its life and death. Biting works, its a tad vicious and catty. But it surprises them and it works.<br>  Or you can punch him in the solar plexus, the upper area of the chest, the lungs. Takes his breath away. Stuns him. <br>  If things are getting really bad, punch the bugger in the throat. Hurts, stuns, he'll be gasping from breath for awhile, you might even put him down. <br>  Or grab his throat. Under the chin where the long collom of the throat begins, and you squeeze. He wont be able to breath and will start to black out. He is easier to control then. <br>  It usually only takes one good fight and the guy will see you are no longer a target. But you will have to keep a dominate/or bad *** facade up around them, as they will look to test you now and then. <br>  Hope that this helps.
AA11275517	I don't think it's important when someone uses the "n word."  A word on its own is meaningless, and only intent gives it meaning.  If someone is using a word to be rude, the word becomes rude.  If it's not meant to offend, don't be offended.<br>  <br>  I think what's more important here is that they seem to be talking about you.  You tell one and the other knows and asks you... obviously there's crap going on behind your back.  Especially if the stuff you're telling them is supposed to be kept private.  I hate that kind of crap.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what to think of these guys because I don't know them.  However, if you DO decide to ditch them because they're jerks, don't bring up the use of the "n word."  If they truly are racist, they will just take this as further proof that blacks are over-sensitive about the word and justify their stupid opinions.  If they AREN'T racist, to them you will just appear to have taken offense to something that wasn't supposed to offend.  And besides that isn't the point.  The other crap, like them talking behind your back, is the point.  Quibbling over words just drags the whole thing down into the mud where it doesn't need to be.|`|2c9f077bcba82e5e5f3b445e3c1c32d7aa	Friends don't call you derogatory, hurtful and racist names.

Now it depends on whether the woman is loose down there. If so, she would want the extra big, thick bla bla and vice versa. But the issue is, the technique.

(for me)
WaByqkO4aa	yep most asians raise their girls to be family oriented, taught their daughters to treat their man right. we are told to look for the right guy and don't date for "the fun of it" like other americans do. we are serious when it comes to relationships|`|I08iONdaaa	you're not the only one that notices this, just the most racist.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	yes...  i know lots of asian girls who are "easy"|`|rceK0oglaa	no i notice it to hmmm are u white just wondering lol|`|5BBy6G36aa	I like asian girls.

ETV7yvNbaa	You should probably break it off.|`|d08rkYlpaa	If you are 22 you need to ignore that nonsense about him being your 4th cousin. She is manipulating you and trying anything she can to keep you under her control. Don't tell him, it wouldn't do him any good to know she said it, or to have to think about it. not supposed to date at 22, I have never heard of such an unreasonable restriction in my whole life! Get away from your parents and be happy with the man you love.  No it is not incest. Even if he really was your 4th cousin, it wouldn't matter. The only restrictions on cousins anywhere in the world is first cousins.  Many famous and wise people married cousins - first, second, third or whatever, like Franklin D. Roosevelt married Eleanor Roosevelt,   John Adams, Einstein, J. S. Bach, The inventor of the Morse Code, and Charles Darwin.  Also, Joseph and the Virgin Mary were cousins.|`|pQGUPITeaa	Fourth cousins is not incest!!!    That's ridiculous.    And at 22 you are old enough to be dating and to have your own life.|`|HwDibcQRaa	probably lieing to you       also thats retarded if u cant date and your a 22 year old woman lmao wth is up with that|`|XIJpOE5Paa	i wouldnt worry to much your mom could be just trying to bullshit you to not date him, and like you sed 4th cousins arent that big of a deal. 90% of the time no blood run throughs the same veins that far apart and if you havent herd of it before than no one else has either...    hope i helped

Also, you can learn from your own satisfaction about what turns you on and how your body reacts to different stumuli. <br>  <br>   Enjoy.|`|0a29b8b116fc09c1b03c557c8ba857d2aa	I love to masterbate. Get in touch with my body, releases stress, and feels good when I spray, and have a massive orgasm.|`|6c4acae1af4f9fbc02be7ea19029dc7caa	no.....buy a farm animal<br>  <br>  baaaaaaaaaaaa baaaaaaaaaaa|`|6f235d6b89752bb6f739db4e894cc73faa	of course! why wouldnt it be??? Its perfectly normal. So go have some fun!|`|AA10074251	Yes it is okay to masturbate. <br>  it is a great stress reliver and it helps you understand your body more and it is also fun to share with your partner.|`|O3hH5MBuaa	I look at it like this it's mine I'll do what I want with it. It's yours, you enjoy it any way you want.|`|d078c446c8c061488a20fbe5d61ace91aa	Its fine. It feels good and your not getting pregnant.|`|m8kheWk4aa	yes it is even i do it &guess what it gives you the feeling of having sex & also without any sideeffects . I think you should carry on with it &masturbate every day. i feel like i'm  in paradise.<br>  <br>  enjoy shake it buddy.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	What's specifics, yes mastubaton is alright, it is a natural form of self gratification.  I know what you are "looking" for in an answer but that is just being immature and childish and I won't give you the satisfaction.|`|AA12063577	I think it's ok to masturbate ... why ... because I feel everyone has the right to pleasure themselves ... I don't see it as a sin ... and I don't see it as being a freak ... it's normal and most - not all - people enjoy doing it ... it also helps people hold off on sex until they feel they're ready for it ... so I guess until the doctors & reseachers tell me it's wrong & doing something bad to our bodies ... I'm going to enjoy myself in every way possible ... lol ... !|`|2a5260866d6082125b158edee76cc4c9aa	sure is its a stress releif|`|AA11146414	As long as you wash your hands afterwards every one has done it or will|`|a637d0b672c011b905c0c865bc2ea40eaa	Yes, its very normal, it  releases stress and feels really good. How could one go wrong with that, lol.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Yes & no.  Some people may think it is "moraly" wrong to masturbate.  It however is safe sex, and a great stress relief.  If you are asking "physically" if it's alright to masturbate then I would say yes.
lb6s0Yvhaa	The best advice I would give you is  talk to him!  Maybe he really does feel the same way.  You'll never know until you try.  Talk to him about this subject in specific.  Ask him if he really does like this girl  and if so..  ask him about the weird relationship you guys have.  Ask him if he actually likes you and tell him to give it to you straight  and you just want to know.  (:|`|QxRKQbt4aa	well considering he is "taken"  he will not come to you, no matter what his feelings towards you are.  If you truely think that he is not into this girl and that he is into you, you better take initiative and tell him whats what before its too late.
AA10733221	You need to find a professional to talk to about your feelings.  There's nothing wrong with asking for help, and trying to learn why people treat you the way they do.  Good luck!|`|13300fd67512c34cb8f9670d59521b40aa	School days are a period of time where people can be quite cruel. Don't let them get to you. You can become bitter and resent the world if you allow them to get under your skin.<br>  <br>  The alternative is to be rather frank and tell them where to get off. You need to cultivate a substantial amount of attitude and conversational skill before you handle it from this angle, however.<br>  <br>  Try not to grow into the mean person I was for pretty much the same reason.|`|AA11638259	Know that the world is NOT like that.  It's just a situation that you are in.<br>  <br>  But also understand that the only person that care the most about you is YOU.<br>  <br>  You MUST love yourself first above everyone else.  This may help; when people are cursing at you and don't like you, it isn't YOUR problem it's their's.  In order for THEM to feel better they have to dislike you, the ironic thing is that the see something YOU they don't like about THEMSELVES.<br>  <br>  It's ok to stand up for yourself, they are just bullies and won't do you any harm.|`|61cea9b90e2e5b43ab87809a818f9058aa	Learn voodoo.|`|bcc95aa1fa1cb2c2bd894ef769df10a5aa	you are being bullied <br>  <br>  try to stand up for yourself -often verbaly fighting back just  one time with enough intensity can get them to back off <br>  <br>  if not get help from the school staff|`|cde58727159fd5660d7cd2c9f7e1632aaa	why do they curse at you, thats not nice.... do your best make a few friends and you'll live|`|7477e2e8db09f60ace2a0a6ff8403808aa	you should reported them at don't let nobody talk **** about you ok

vkhQz16Laa	Your only 12.   I hope you know that dating is just trying out people to see if you want to marry them. You still have a long way to go. Just live your life to the fullest. Having a boyfriend won't make you any better. It's not cool. And think about it when you break up with someone it just makes you depressed and you would've wished that you were just single. Your mom knows whats good for you.|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	your names kennedy..  boy or girl?    and if she doesn't think you're ready than you're probably not.  mother knows best.|`|2F4vkfnxaa	you don't need one!

That guy that asked you out was a good sign, so you know that you aren't hideous. lol    A guy will ask you out one day and he'll be great...hopefully.     Good luck!|`|lFRYf7Xxaa	I am sure that it is not the way you look. I didn't have a boyfriend in hs and I am a cute girl. You just haven't met the right one. Be patient. It's not worth it to date just to date anyway. Make sure he's worth it.|`|YraPn46waa	Sometimes prettiness will work against a girl. If a girl is very pretty - and you are AND is shy....the effect will intimidate boys. It can come across as haughtiness or reserve. Guys won't ask you out as they think you are out of their league.     Make a real effort to be friendly and smile at guys. Instead of focusing on how shy you feel, think about how shy they may feel inside, and think about how you can put them at ease. It will be rewarded!|`|zm7aolYFaa	naa its not how u look. but are u a nice person, if soo i think u would have one.|`|fBXRNKyuaa	you're really pretty.    but being in high school, guys are immature and unwilling to look past the fact that you are shy to figure out who you are. i'm sure the right guy will come along eventually.|`|QxRKQbt4aa	you're not bad, kinda cute.  But listen, shyness sucks.  Luckily guys are supposed to do all the pursuing.  Now you say you want a bf, but the guy who asked you out you turned him down.  Beggers cant be choosers.  I understand if you werent interested in him though.    Remember you are still in high school and you dont look that old.  Dating really gets serious in college, so dont worry about it.  It will come in time.  It is not because of the way you look.

But the man can be in love with his woman yet want more from her than she is capable of doing. Therefore men seek the pleasure they want elsewhere by any means. Men are capable of loving one woman yet have sex with others having no feelings other than sexual stimulation with the other woman. Its a guy thing. My only advice to women is to talk with their man and at least work out the differences and give him as much as you can deem acceptable or he will seek it elsewhere.
459015132713e069635a41b112b19e8aaa	well instead of asking him, why don't you just flirt with him and get to know him yourself instead of getting your mates to talk to him. don't be nervous, c'mon most emo's want relationships n if he smiled when they said you're name just go for it, or start with flirting.|`|007b7a25dba12ff42208be81e933cac1aa	A smile is a good indication that he likes you, it so never happens at any other point in "said" emo boys life...But on the other hand..Why would you ever want to date someone who is "emo?"

AA11730201	Just because all of your friends have a guy doesn't mean you need one. It's easy to get a guy, but it's very difficult to get a compatible guy! I'm sure people have told you to "be yourself" but you seem to think you're "too tough." As long as you are educated and have manners, you should be fine. Instead of acting in a way that you're really not, you should be yourself, that's the best way to find a a guy whose personality will complement yours. Be patient and don't be afraid to approach and talk to guys.|`|49e67a93e4e4c4cbc2efd7f53464911caa	ITS  ok  to  be tuff.|`|AA11726910	your just not ready, how old are you? you have time, trust me, just enjoy being young.|`|0698dc95a0300dc76b8525d8d76b4701aa	great answer all of them|`|7354cf0ac525c75cb0d05d5d4e74109faa	its not time yet...be patient|`|AA10976046	When the right guy comes along, you will have him.

ZCoMmjDIaa	Dude, don't be the other woman I know you probably have feelings for him or whatever but your ruining his wives life, let him divorce her and if he does then go after him, its just not right to ruin that ladies life. The reason hes not texting back is probably because he got caught.|`|AA10858602	If you are hoping to marry a man who will cheat on you then you are going in the right direction.  Why stick with texting?  Go the next step and give him a call.  If he loves you so much and wants to be with you, they why is he hiding it from his wife?  He's not going to find a way to marry you, he's going to find a way to keep you on the side.  He didn't text you lastnight, because he was making love to his wife.  Get a clue.
15244706e9e7d9db2eca018bf21910b4aa	Be patient.  If it's meant to be, you shouldn't need to keep up the relationship yourself.  It should be mutual.  He should probably get an e-mail address, even if he needs to use a library.  You are communicating via telephone, that's a good sign, but I'm not sure why you think it is insufficient.  Long distance relationships are a challenge but that's partly good I think because they test the strength of the relationship.  Both parties need to be strong.  There's the postal service, there's prayer and thinking about what to say when you talk to the person.  <br>  I remember expressing concern about the difficulty of a long distance relationship to someone in Germany.  He had moved there from the USA and she was calling.  He answered that while it lasts, it lasts.  Good answer, keep a good thing going while we can.|`|a2e30011aff7b05ab862966372594061aa	you let him go. it won't be easy. but its the safest way to go, long distance relationships are stupid and they don't work anyway.|`|0731ab92bc2fb20398e0ed48785e50ebaa	send him ur recorded video tapes and tell him to send his in return.

Is she drifting from you because all you ever talk about when you're together is your kids which she is trying to have herself?  Reassure her and tell her to just let life take its natural flow.  Sometimes when we are desperate to have something, the harder it is for us to have them.  Tell her to always count her blessings and be a blessing to her as well.  Try to bring your kids to be close to her like an auntie so they can also bond. And don't be jealous it your kids will become close to your friend. Be equally happy if that will happen. And most of all tell her that no matter what happens you will always be there for her. She's part of your life, she's family too.|`|AA10993379	phone her|`|53249d8df7f7a3d70e580ca39e6c3d1eaa	it might be hard for ur friend to watch u have two kids when she cant have any.<br>  just try visiting her alot and try talking to her. and if she is married now, she should have kids soon <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  gluck<br>  SEK

I am trying to figure out the same question.|`|edb490651aedcf83ff86e7e79a2cc127aa	MOST LIKELY, HE LIKES YOU! IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW FOR SURE, ASK HIM! THAT'S RIGHT! JUST COME OUT AND ASK HIM.

So I wouldn't worry about it.
X8fTcaP2aa	In   my   opinion  i  think it is   extremely   hard    to   get a schizoid open up.  How do i know that?  Because i suspect i might have SPD.   I suspect because:  -Never had interest in friends,  -i like to be alone,   -don't show emotions  i'm very cold,  -don't care about other people  -i'm very withdrawn,  -don't like to talk too much  -take pleasure in very few activities  -like to do the same thing over and over again  -weak social skills  -i like to keep a distance from everyone  -very quiet shy, i only talk when i have to/ something interests me  -sometimes i feel superior  -i do everything on my own  -i don't like to be in a group and i don't like to be with others  - lack of desire for friendship/relationship  - lack of close friends       In fact i think i have never  really opened myself to anyone in my entire life because it is very hard for me to trust someone and i don't really care about what other people say about myself. When i can , i avoid unsympathic people as much as possible . When i had friends i didn't tell everything about myself because i don't really trust anyone, i only trust myself , i don't even trust in my family.  I like to be alone and spend a lot of time alone and i do this because i actually like it.  I have no intention to change myself.    Back to your question:    If you want to change your friend then give up immediately , it is not going to work. If your friend is a schizoid then she is never ever going to become extrovert. However you said she is more open with you than anyone else . It means she likes to be with you. The worst thing you can do is to spend as much time as you can with her. Remember: people with SPD like to be alone a lot ,  so the more time  you spend with her the less she wants to be with you. After a while she will avoid you if you want to spend too much time with her. Also do not lie to her in anything,  be honest with her. If she finds out you lie in something she is not going to trust you she will probably ignore you. Be kind to her  everyone likes someone who is kind to people.  Try to find out her interest and you can talk about a lot. Do not force her to talk  if she doesn't want to talk about anything. Sometimes people with SPD wants to be alone, so it means when she wants to be alone  do not disturb her/ do not force her to be with you. You will need a lot of patience to do this  but if you have a strong willpower you can do it.     Most important is: do not rush things /take things very slowly  leave her some privacy when she wants to. Even if she doesn't show too much emotion she might be very sensitive inside so never make fun of her behind her back don't do things what can make her suffer don't cause pain for her. If you betray her even once , she will never ever trust you again doesn't matter what you do or what you say.|`|BY02DhfWaa	just don't get to pushy keep your distance don't get to possessive she will get to the point that she will trust and once she does start don't ever break that trust because she will never trust you again or it could be yrs before she trust anyone again just be careful how you handle this situation this is touchy .|`|VSCYTZ38aa	well you could stop calling her a schizoid for starters|`|CgvmWNLYaa	just talk to her. tell her how you feel and how you see her. tell her you're there for her. and good luck!|`|gOVHPCz3aa	f*** her every night and give her roses and keep her happy.   give her your dick in your mouth when she doesnt want it.  lick up her *ussy and blow in it|`|AA10824931	Be open with her and never cause her any reason to doubt you!  It may take time and patience.  Good luck and she's lucky to have you as her friend.|`|e4XBo2rgaa	Well i think you should just be patient and cool with "schizoid". I think the key to open schizioid up is to chip in a few words or sentences that signals your intention to be more than just friends.  The main idea is not to over do it, these "attentional signalers" should be used approximately 3 times a day if you guys talk alot, if you don't speak alot once a day will do.  If she has the same intention as you or if she is willing to give it a try she will be V E R Y receptive to these signals and then you can gradually make your move.  If she is not receptive or move strangely towards these signals then i think you should keep your relationship with her just as friends.  Let me know what happens if you try this.    Good luck   Nigel
F3YoHzOCaa	Maybe you lack social skills. maybe it's because you can't spell 'scene' or 'why'. Maybe it's because you intimidate guys. Maybe you seem out of their league. Maybe you whine too much, or are too obsessed with finding a boyfriend. Anything's possible.|`|4hJgn2e5aa	you havent meet the right guy that loves you for who you are. "dont change for anyone :P|`|hCsAHDjNaa	You can't always expect guys to come to you. Talk to more guys, give them the chance to realize how cool you are.  I'm not judging you or anything, but since you said that you skateboard and play football, maybe guys don't think of you like that, since you don't sound too girly. Most guys go for girly girls. But don't worry, you'll find the right guy someday who appreciates you for all that you are :D|`|XW0gqnJIaa	maybe they are all stupid and don't realize how kool you are|`|2y3a7xqTaa	the first and mainly reason is because they are stupid! and also maybe because u llike so many things guys like, they think of u as a buddy and not a friend, but don't change someday there will be a guy that will see you as more than a friend! :)|`|XGeqNM4Daa	how are we supposed to tell you that??? and what the heck is a seene???

I am prolly betting that he is shy because if he was not into you he would not stick around.      Shyness is hard to get over, but if he is your boyfriend you might have to take initiative.  Next chance you get, grab him by the shoulders and give him a big kiss right on the mouth.   He is your boyfriend afterall, so it wont be too much.

Also interesting how many girls considered the answer "I don't like girls" to be sufficiently helpful to warrant wasting their time posting it!    Girls work in strange ways.|`|IGgkEO9qaa	I don't really understand what u r asking. But if you are asking girls what they like in a GUY then here is my answer. Most girls want a guy who is not a jerk. If she does something nice for you like buys you lunch one day and you grab the lunch and then go without the simplest of nice mannerisms, she will feel like she is not good enough for you. Trust me, to keep a girl around you need to thank her for the wonderful stuff she does. And if she changes her hair or somthing, compliment her. Because 9 times out of 10 they are changing themselves so that you will notice. And, just be nice. I have also noticed that the whole jealously thing works. If you are a guy and you have a girlfriend, then more girls will want to go out with you.

But here's what I like in a guy:    -outgoing, friendly  -honest  -sincere  -not egotistical  -respectful  -smart  -cute smile  -nice dresser  -tall  -funny  -morals  -chivalrous (I know that sounds really weird, but what girl doesn't like a guy to treat her like a princess? :D )
AA12394670	Ask your bf if you can talk to him honestly about something that you have heard. Tell him that you have heard that he has asked you bff out and want to know if this is true. Try not to get angry when doing this. Tell him you need to trust him and you want to know the truth even if this is not what you want to hear. If he says no forget it and get on with life. If he says yes, (you may feel very angry, hurt and betrayed at this time), tell him how you feel and he should have talked to you about his feelings with you and sorted it out which ever way it went before betraying you. BFF do not do this to their friends so if this is this case you need to find another bff.|`|AA10988085	Someone who would lie to you about something as serious as that isn't really your friend.

Por isto elas devem ser ignoradas e se possível rezar por elas para que se transformem em pessoas melhores e tenham amor ao seu próximo. Tudo de bom para vocês
20ca17f33f73be26f942800ecadd8699aa	A bíblia diz que o sexo antes do casamento só é proibido se atrasar a cerim?nia, afinal, o padre n?o deve ficar esperando.|`|dd1bdb7d8005f98b1e6c95e1010942c3aa	Boa pergunta, realmente nunk vi isso na Biblia...<br>  Nem nos 10 mandamentos...|`|59ab0b8e96fde63aab2e32a9b9b8779baa	Castidade é um dos 10 mandamentos da lei de Deus, portanto quem n?o segue-os direito permanece no pecado!|`|1ba19fbe3019cd579e2b8a5fa080608aaa	Se o sexo foi formado por Deus, porque ele é pecado”? Esta é a pergunta que milh?es de jovens tementes a Deus se fazem, ou fazem a terceiros, quando se sentem excitados e desejosos de praticar o sexo livremente, sem constrangimento, sem culpa. “Porque é necessário casar-se primeiro, se os dois se amam”? “Deus n?o é amor”? S?o outras perguntas bastante comuns. <br>  <br>  Muitos jovens até querem genuinamente compreender qual é a vontade de Deus em rela??o ao sexo para n?o pecar, mas s?o t?o bombardeados, massacrados pela mídia e pelos ímpios que dizem: “os tempos s?o outros”; “ninguém consegue ficar sem sexo sem adoecer”; “n?o seja careta”; “todo mundo faz”, e tantos outros falsos argumentos que torna-se quase impossível ao jovem ou à jovem permanecer puro até o casamento. <br>  <br>  Mas a realidade é que Deus deseja, e com zelo, que o homem e a mulher sejam virgens ao se casarem, pois o casamento terreno, nada mais é do que uma figura do Casamento celestial entre o Cordeiro e a Sua Noiva, virgem e pura: “Quisera eu me suportásseis um pouco mais na minha loucura. Suportai-me, pois. Porque zelo por vós com zelo de Deus; visto que vos tenho preparado para vos apresentar como virgem pura a um só esposo, que é Cristo” (2 Co 11:1,2). <br>  <br>  Se nós, que somos a Noiva de Cristo, devemos estar puros para as bodas celestiais, porque n?o deveríamos estar puros para as bodas terrenas? O princípio de Deus foi estabelecido já no primeiro casamento realizado na face da terra, onde os dois eram virgens, puros e n?o se envergonhavam disso: “E a costela que o SENHOR Deus tomara ao homem, transformou-a numa mulher e lha trouxe. E disse o homem: Esta, afinal, é osso dos meus ossos e carne da minha carne; chamar-se-á varoa, porquanto do var?o foi tomada. Por isso, deixa o homem pai e m?e e se une à sua mulher, tornando-se os dois uma só carne.  Ora, um e outro, o homem e sua mulher, estavam nus e n?o se envergonhavam.” (Gn 2:22-25).<br>  <br>  Deus é o mesmo ontem hoje e o será para sempre e Ele n?o muda de assunto. O homem sim, é que para justificar suas tendências e vontades, nem sempre santas, fica dizendo que os tempos s?o outros, que temos que agir com mente aberta, nos ajustarmos à civiliza??o, etc. Mas o apóstolo Paulo nos ensina a n?o nos conformarmos com este século, com o sistema do mundo (que por sinal, jaz no Maligno): "E n?o vos conformeis com este século, mas transformai-vos pela renova??o da vossa mente, para que experimenteis qual seja a boa, agradável e perfeita vontade de Deus" (Rm 12:2). <br>  <br>  A Bíblia é clara em mostrar que a vontade de Deus é que os noivos sejam virgens ao se casarem.  Confira algumas passagens:<br>  <br>  1) A noiva virgem que Abra?o mandou seu servo buscar para Isaque, os quais prefiguram o Pai, o Espírito Santo, Cristo e a sua Igreja: "A mo?a era mui formosa de aparência, virgem, a quem nenhum homem havia possuído; ela desceu à fonte, encheu o seu cantaro e subiu" (Gn 24:16);<br>  <br>  2) A obriga??o, estabelecida por lei divina, do homem se casar quando alguém tira a virgindade de uma mo?a: "Se alguém seduzir qualquer virgem que n?o estava desposada e se deitar com ela, pagará seu dote e a tomará por mulher" (Ex 22:16);<br>  <br>  3) Um sacerdote (e todos os santos do Senhor s?o sacerdotes) só poderia tomar por esposa mulher virgem: "Ele tomará por mulher uma virgem" (Lv 21:13);<br>  <br>  4) O Salvador da humanidade, Jesus Cristo, só poderia vir ao mundo se fosse através de uma virgem (Mt 1:23).|`|52ef74e335ebc8cee0c5b0986f7b03b6aa	"Pega uma bíblia e leia pagina por pagina , garanto que vai achar!"|`|fb543758dbfcb7cfbb7d31d663bc1e61aa	LEIA QUE VC VAI ACHAR|`|d3ea67d444d1abde708d9e1ecf957b89aa	Diversos textos da bíblia falam contra a prostitui??o ou fornica??o (1 Tessalonicenses 4:3 / At 15:20 / 1Corintios 6:18). é bem verdade na época da escrita da bíblia a prostitui??o n?o era identica a atual (venda do corpo por dinheiro), mas basicamente a "venda" do corpo pelo prazer. Portanto, fazer sexo antes do casamento somente pelo prazer é pecado. Deus fez o sexo para o casamento. Na primeira rela??o do casal nas núpcias eles se tornam uma só carne, como uma alian?a n?o diante dos homens, mas agora diante intimamente um do outro e de Deus (Gênesis 2:24; Romanos 7:1-3; 1 Coríntios 7:39).

Your child or a lame trip?|`|366081d83d16a4ff5ac8390f5b0aba17aa	Well, it depends.  Is this your first child?  If so, your guilt will probably prevent you from moving the celebration to another weekend, even though the little kiddo really won't know the difference.  I suggest you let your boss know as far ahead as possible that this is a very important birthday for you, and could he please send someone else.  You can offer to provide as much input into the planning as needed.  If this meeting is always at the same time each year, and you must attend every year, then when your baby is old enough to understand, explain what is going on and move the celebration to a more convenient time.  Afterall, it isn't the day itself in the child's eyes, it is the recognition and celebration.  As long as his/her significant others are there and the party isn't 6 months later, they roll with the punches.  My May baby always has her kid party in the summer so the fun can be outside.
6ac3bec148e28ef5b0eb567d9846306caa	He went home and remembered whatever it was you broke up over.  You have been relegated to 'booty call' status. Do yourself a favor(and by extension any illegitimate children you end up having with this guy) and move right on.

Strangely enough breaking up once means that there are things that can never be resolved at the basic level.  He might be more lonely than interested or is just missing the old times.  If you get back together you'll be back in square one.  I advise you to cut him off or you'll keep getting hurt.|`|42a738483794e94f82e55456e6f80ddfaa	i dont think he is, because if he was he should've told you when he wants to meet again , let me tell you some thing , may be he is a little , but if you want to make him more interested in you , find an other guy and be with him infront of mike and then see he will be very jealous and will  call you like hell , and would want to be with you all the time.|`|dbf8f89019b08a798ede0466478b64e5aa	You are probably hassling him 2 much, wat ive learnt is if u keep calling or emailing a guy they get annoyed and ignore u or he just afraid to let his feelings out to u so hes stoppin himself tlkin to u cuz else he will let it all spill or he may think u arent interested in him! try to show u like him a bit more nd why were you both crying??? x|`|e92bbc1dbe884978cbee2acc13fff6b6aa	Guys are so weird. maybe he just needs some time to think. but he should'nt make you wait to long. But it's his job to make the next step. Wait a bit then move on. Hold your head up high!|`|AA12166774	Sounds as though he has someone. He maybe alittle interested but has prior obligations towards someone else.   Don't get your hopes too  high.   If he was truly interested he would have contacted you by now.   Let the man hunt you not you be the  hunter.  Move on because you are becoming emotional as females often do.   If you waqit on him you may have a very  long wait.  Don't get disappointed by waiting.  Crying doesn't mean a thing just your emotions are in to play and you may be in for a let  down.  Be careful.

Then to soften the blow, tell her a few more nice things about herself and that you hope it's ok for you to be honest with her because it's not your intention to hurt her.|`|AA11981521	Friend, you are kind of annoying .|`|aa0abecee07107e9fd06492dd9b1855faa	That's exactly it.

7cc8efcee4413e62484edfafca136b7daa	I would just leave it alone. If they really want to be together, then one of them just needs to grow a set and tell the other person how they feel. I wouldn't try to hook them up because if you did, and it didn't work out or their friendship did end up ruined, she might be mad with you, and that might ruin your friendship with her. Just leave well-enough alone, and see if they can work that out themselves...afterall, it's been 4 years and are not even in the same country.|`|2c80eb3cbab5a752bdf8d8e69604f18daa	Leave them alone... give them time to decide wht they want to do by themselves...|`|4449ff9a4df3bcfe67a08426711b9b3caa	It does happen in some relationships and your glad she still looks up to you.

d847ed5eb7270024c58d082a31fd16e3aa	This is tough because you don't want to directly hurt your father in law's feeling but at the same time I think you should make it clear he's not going to me camping out at your house. Maybe try telling him you have plans the day after and that if he wants to come by and visit that would be fine but that you are leaving the next morning. Even if all you do is some after christmas returns or shopping if you leave, he's more likely to leave too. Try telling your husband how you really feel or it will cause some strain on you now and in the future.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	From what you have said, I can not believe your husband is eager for him to visit. However, you need to sit down with your husband and calmly tell him of your feelings. They are very valid. God bless****|`|AA11860478	Um, if you don't know how to approach your husband with this how would we know?<br>  <br>  Best guess:  <br>  1.  Sit down with hub.<br>  2.  "I am concerned about your dad staying here again."  Say it just like that.  Hopefully he'll ask why, or he'll just start defending him without you having said why.<br>  3.  Tell him what you can want, and see if you can come to an agreement.  Can he visit for Xmas dinner?  One night visit?  Will husband be willing to back you on a firm "no drinking in our house" rule?  <br>  <br>  This is just like any other issue between two people, married or not.  You communicate about your respective wants and then see if there's a middle ground you can live with.<br>  <br>  Christmas is about family, yes...but it sounds like this particular family member needs to get his act together.  I don't blame you.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  P.S.  If he stays, hide the booze well.  He will find it otherwise.|`|64964d89cfa65d36853990d7cd451dd3aa	That is a tough one, but wouldn't you father-in-law be more comfortible at a Hotel (at his expense) so you and your hubby can have more 'holiday privacy'?|`|AA11144530	Have your husband tell him not to come. Tell your husband your specific concerns and back him up. He let him stay for a very long time before, so your husband may be a little afraid to stand up to him. Use what you know about your husband to make him feel strong so that he can confront him. When your husband does stand up for you, give him a treat that indicates just how thankful you are to have a strong man.|`|AA11378269	make plans with hubby to visit your parents or someone else, thus leaving no where for father in law to stay!|`|b3a237424ed1aad68bee604b26b20a15aa	Put the dad-in-law up at a hotel for a few days; the cost will be worth having him not stay with you!!|`|7dcaaafa6aef148c9cc745e57a330623aa	You should be honest with your husband.<br>  <br>  Tell him that you don't mind him visiting for Christmas, but that you don't feel comfortable with him staying for an extended period of time, especially without warning, with his alchoholic tendencies.<br>  <br>  Ask him how he would feel had the situation been reversed and your father came to stay with the both of you for a few months drunken and stealing from you both.|`|a145cc9e2528080b74d19b8c317b2332aa	Put him up in a hotel close to your home and pay for only the night so he has to leave in the morning.
d0fc799651ebaad8292d6f20e7a00b75aa	you seem to be experiencing emotional distress. its unfortunate that your friend moved away but theres always AIM or email! look on the bright side. you can always arrange a visit and im sure shes just a phone call away. be open minded to meeting new people. of course they will not replace your friend but they might end up being just as good of a friend as she is. cheer up|`|3ec5dca09e22af08a3d2801c91b55e58aa	i no its soooooo hard my bestie moved states about 5 yrs ago and i bulled my eye's out at the airport :( but we talk all the time plus fly to stay with eachother on the holidays. trust me it will get easier chicky.... when u's see eachother again it will be like she never left :) stay ocuppied, go shopping, party, movies, makeovers!!!

I am concerned for you. I hope that the not eating/throwing up part is over your emotional stress from your friend leaving, trust me, that stress is real and it's making you sick, so it needs to be dealt with! I am hoping that with some time, you will get better and learn to deal with it, but you should try to get a handle on this asap. <br>  There are many ways to deal with stress and yes, I realize you feel alone right now, but you HAVE to learn to lean on your other friends right now. You need them and you are going to have to allow them to help you get through this, I'm not at all saying that you should forget about your friend who moved, but you have to move on with your life and find a balance between the way things now have to be and still being in contact with your friend who moved! <br>  Don't let the eating thing go too far, it could literally put your life at risk, and I'm sure that's not what you or your best friend would want. <br>  Life isn't easy, and it doesn't usually make sense. But in time, you will find that thigs do happen for a reason, you just have to give it enough time to make sense to you! Please know that you aren't alone! There is always someone willing to help you! And please remember that you need to try to get a handle on the eating thing, it's serious and nothing to play around with. It can get out of hand before you realize it, and trust me, from experience, it's a hard road to travel to get yourself out of it. If at all possible, stop it before it starts! <br>  Good luck and seriously, email me or anything, if you need to! Put something in the subject box so I know it's not junk mail!|`|7fb3f0899e714011969a5c084070b91daa	when I was in school my friend moved away and it was very hard, I mean she was like my best friend and the only one I could turn to for help.

76b1ec991da6cf414e4a5c1d92a7b8d2aa	Friendship is a term used to denote co-operative and supportive behaviour between two or more social entities. This article focuses on the notion specific to interpersonal relationships. In this sense, the term connotes a relationship which involves mutual knowledge, esteem, and affection. Friends will welcome each other's company and exhibit loyalty towards each other, often to the point of altruism. Their tastes will usually be similar and may converge, and they will share enjoyable activities. They will also engage in mutually helping behavior, such as exchange of advice and the sharing of hardship. A friend is someone who may often demonstrate reciprocating and reflective behaviors. Yet for many, friendship is nothing more than the trust that someone or something will not harm them. Value that is found in friendships is often the result of a friend demonstrating on a consistent basis:<br>  <br>  the tendency to desire what is best for each other. <br>  sympathy and empathy. <br>  honesty, perhaps in situations where it may be difficult for others to speak the truth. <br>  mutual understanding. <br>  In a comparison of personal relationships, friendship is considered to be closer than acquaintanceship, although there is a range of degrees of intimacy in both friendships and acquaintances. Friendship and acquaintanceship can be thought of spanning across the same continuum.<br>  <br>  The principal disciplines studying friendship are sociology, anthropology and zoology. Various theories of friendship have been proposed, among which are social psychology, social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship</a>|`|5d0db0e3a3fddb9f169210f85585bde9aa	FRIENDSHIP IS A BOON ,NOT GIVEN TO EVERYONE.IT IS THE PUREST FORM OF LOVE,WHICH IS AHEAD OF ANY EXPECTATIONS.A FRIEND,SHARES BOTH OUR HAPPINESS AND WORRIES.HE ENCOURAGES US IN OUR GOOD TIMES AND CONVINCES OR GUIDES US TO TAKE THE RIGHT PATH.HE IS A PERSON WHO OCCUPIES THE GREATEST POSITION IN OUR HEARTS.
2021c62da959fb83b78dad453cdce43aaa	I got most of this information from Wikipedia and it is all correct. We have been swinging for about 6 years now and we really enjoy it. If you have any other questions, please feel free to IM or email us. We'd be happy to help.<br>  <br>  <br>  Swinging activities can include (but are not limited to):<br>  <br>  Exhibitionism: having sex with a partner while being watched. <br>  <br>  Voyeurism: watching others have sex (perhaps with the above mentioned partner). <br>  <br>  Soft Swinging or Soft Swap: kissing, stroking, or having oral sex with a third or fourth person. This may be in the form of a threesome or group sex, or partners may literally be swapped. <br>  <br>  Full Swap: having penetrative sex with someone other than one's partner, which is the commonly understood definition of swinging (though not necessarily the most common type). <br>  <br>  Group Sex: An all inclusive term for activities involving multiple partners in the same vicinity. <br>  <br>  Typically, swinging activities occur when a married or otherwise committed couple engages with either another couple, multiple couples, or a single individual. These acts can occur in the same room (often called same room swinging) though different or separate room swinging does occur. Sex on these occasions is often referred to as play.<br>  <br>  While the vast majority of swingers are heterosexual couples, a major part of Lifestyle activities are bisexual in nature. A large portion of female swingers, while they may or may not identify as bisexual, are interested in female-female sexual contact. Male-male contact is very rare, and usually frowned upon at a Swing Club/Party.<br>  <br>  Female bisexuality and bicurious is extremely common in both the urban and traditional swinging scene and tends to be the norm amongst participants. No studies have been conducted as to what percentage of swinging women who define themselves as bisexual would be open to romantic as well as sexual relations with both genders.<br>  <br>  Male bisexuality is less common in the swinging scene, but is becoming more common and more accepted. More openly bi men and bisexual couples (male-female couples where both partners are bisexual) are appearing on the scene. Whether this is due to increasing acceptance in the scene or greater numbers of men "turning bi" is open to discussion. Depending on the club or social situation, male bisexuality among swingers may either be frowned upon, or openly accepted.<br>  <br>  The acceptance of singles at swinging events varies from geographic area to geographic area. Some swinging 'clubs' have a policy of allowing only couples and females, but most do allow single men on selected nights. Single females are often admitted at reduced admission price. Parties and private events may differ, however, and are often restricted to couples or couples and single females only.<br>  <br>  The reasons for this vary. Most (but certainly not all) of the people who pay to participate in swinger events are male-female couples and most swinging couples are more interested in interacting with other couples or with single women than with single men. Thus, swinger events strive to achieve a balance between male and female participants or have a (usually slightly) larger number of females than males.<br>  <br>  A common complaint among swingers is that single men change the tone and nature of event. While outright hostility towards single men is rarely prevalent, an abundance of single males is rarely looked upon favourably in any swinging context. When single males are permitted their numbers are usually limited by high entrance fees or stringent membership requirements.<br>  <br>  Some swingers oppose the involvement of any singles of either sex in swinging because of the fear that they might split existing couples. While this might be a fear of some new couples, couples who have been part of the "Lifestyle" for some time report that the only way a couple can "split" is when one of the couple is looking outside the primary relationship. This is not the norm in a swinger relationship.|`|d47f94a9a002e67d09e63d77d3f08adbaa	Swinging is swapping partners.<br>  <br>  Depends on the clubs!|`|77622be92ab404409f818db551a4987aaa	Swinging, the way it is used today in the sexual sense, is when a couple opens-up their relationship sexually to other couples (i.e. swapping partners) or to a single (i.e. threesomes).<br>  <br>  What happens at a swingers club?  Well, it's allot like any other club, a bar, a dance floor, tables, etc., except there are also public and private rooms where you can go to have sex with your partner, or with others.<br>  <br>  There are twosomes, threesomes, foursomes, and moresomes that happen.  There is bisexual activity, mostly between females, though.  There is very little male bisexual activity.

d3ef71ddd8b3e8978beeaf8997e49478aa	Be honest with him and he will appreciate you more because guys like it when girls are honest with them.  This way you will not only make it easy for him to feel more comfortable around you.   I know it works because I can remember many times I was in strange situations my self.<br>  <br>  When I look back I regret one situation where as one guy almost kissed me and he didn't.  He was so adorable too! I feel badly that I didn't invite him to my grade 9 grad.  I went stag instead because most of female friends didn't have date.  I regret it when I look back because it's really was my loss more then it was his.<br>  <br>  If you like him then explain that you were taken off guard and that were feeling so nervous about it.  I think he would understand considering that he probably was feeling the same way.  Especially since you reacted.  Maybe you both laugh about it after?    It's good to laugh after you get things off your conscience.|`|1af82f4322fb6009f2617a2dd40da4dcaa	you probably scared him away.|`|AA10544147	sounds like you ran him off.|`|AA11127444	You start talking with him first.|`|AA11729278	ok.... he thinks u feel akward when he's with you... so he's giving you a little space or.... he also feels akward with you.... cuz of what had happened between you too... you should talk to each other and tell him what happened.... this might lead to a tragedy... better fix it now before its too late....

What was the question again. OIh yea....I forget.|`|4e57e49544ae2cfff74ef442f07a8b52aa	Morons? Just remember someday you will be old and forgetful. You did not say how old your parents are. Have you ever heard of dementia or Alzheimer's. If you are that concerned maybe you should take them for a check up. Don"t just let them go. Someone needs to go with them to explain to the Doctor what is going on there are medication that can help them with forgetfulness. Remember they were there for you when you were to little to care for yourself . Now its  your time to help them.|`|9c4778731269ce571362b723b8902ee0aa	I have a theory that after all the raising kids and responsibility of work, they feel free!

There are things that can be done though.  I am over 50 and had a real problem with aches, pains and memory until I discovered natural supplements.  I love the Shu Li Patches for aches and pains.  The sublingual B-12 is good for energy and you can get a 30 day supply for free ($2.95) shipping and handling.  You may want to read some of my e-zine articles on what I've been through.  I was really miserable and now I feel great.  Just do a google search for "Jeanne Mullis" to find some very helpful sites.<br>  <br>  Of course there are disclaimers as these are not "medical" cures, but I can only tell you from personal experience that they helped both me and my husband feel much better.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  <br>  <br>  Check it out at the link below.

437c625b88b901d30110ed10a7d130fbaa	Well a girl who loves and appreciates you will show how much she cares by worrying about you. She will want you to be happy. she will also be protective of you.By this I mean she will not want people to take advantage of you. She will be your best friend and will never take you for granted.|`|7c3c375a4019def8d703c0dd6bcce4b7aa	Just be upfront and don't beat around the bush.|`|8a81ff262acaf5500cade2d94005901baa	I dont know|`|9e6b9a899bf64c8345b0172da880563caa	Tell her what?|`|AA10654734	She has your best interests at heart and she is honest with you.
96e6b353c7b3a1101aa9485534113f4faa	She probably does like you since she looks at you alot, but have you ever talked to her ? Well if you haven't you should because it will be weird if you tell her you like her and had never even talked to her before that, and don't wait forever to talk to her because if you never ask her if she likes you, then you will never know.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  <br>  The worst thing that could happen is that she will say she dosen't like you, so what, there are plenty of other girls in the world.|`|8df3757f69d1a2ed2fae4fd1d92f749eaa	It is hard to tell when it comes to a women. She might like you or then again she might just be staring at you for a totally different reason. What you need to do is go up to her when she is by herslef and ask if she would like to go out sometime. I dont think I would ask right away if she likes you. There are ways of finding out without being too upfront. If she says she will go out with you then she probably does like you, if not then better luck next time! But the only way to find out is by talking to her!|`|AA12211023	She might well do... then again she might not. The only way to know is to ask her.

a18a5176e4c4eabb01d0b5162c985dccaa	As hard as it is, you'll have to wait for her to come around.  And believe me, she should, but maybe she's not on the right medication or something.

But love triangles normally are. But no offense, she doesn't sound like someone you could spend the rest of your life with. There are millions of women out there! GO out and migle!

Trust me I know how difficult it can be to walk away from someone you love, even if they are not treating you right and do not love you. <br>  I have been in this situation before and my friends just told me to give up, have some self-respect, and move on. I will not advise to do the same, because think deep down inside you actually know it is what you have to do anyway ........<br>  I understand you only want the best for her, but she clearly cannot see it right now. You will not be able to help her simply because she does not think she needs your help. Plus she does not love you and there is nothing you can do to change that!<br>  I am sorry to say this, but you have to give her up mate. Try to learn a lesson from this, and believe me if you are meant to be together it will happen! Just let her go, and if she comes back she is yours.....if not, she never has been. You know, the hard thing to do is usually the right thing to do.<br>  However, it is a lot easier for me to say this, than for you to do it. Take your time, let the decision come to you.

Even if this woman decides to invest in time with you, would you ever fully trust her? Then you have to spend all this energy trying to keep up with her. Keep the ball in your court. Understand she will not commit and enjoy the sex or if you want to be in love with someone get out of your current situation and find someone worthy.|`|a32ddeaeea18b1a5379b409e0eb27fd7aa	At some point in our lives we have all experienced unrequitted love.  You have to come to the realization that you CAN'T make somebody love and you.  You also have to care a llittle bit more about yourself and understand that THERE IS someone out there who WILL love and who is deserving of you.  Have faith that there somebody walking the earth right now, who is going to make all your dreams come true.  But you'll never meet her when you're pining over somebody who has no interest in you.

3517a8f2b88449787833e5ac5cbb667eaa	The best kind of present is the kind that came from your heart and that you made.

Like dishes, laundry, breakfast  in bed, etc. Good Luck and I hope she likes it.|`|AA11549317	Give her $100 every month.|`|AA11911294	I'd say it really depends on her age. Maybe for 20+, chocolates? Roses and jewelry? Something that has to do with a favorite hobby? The list can go on. :)<br>  <br>  And I'd suggest getting a present for a relative about maybe 5 days before her birthday. Then when you're done wrapping, hide it and take it out on her birthday! ^_^

It's a holiday I'm sure I'd love if I had a boyfriend, but as of now I would rather we could just skip it because I get sad seeing a bunch of couples all happy and everything.  Now that my friend isn't single, it makes it a little worse because she'll be doing something with her bf while I'll be sitting in my Anthropology class... oh boy.

Each event has a theme that guests can choose to participate in, or simply come in and luxuriate in the provocative atmosphere. Clothing is optional and nudity is mandatory in the play areas. Somewhere between a NY dance club, burlesque show, a wine & cheese party and an erotic circus, these events are truly unique, and lovingly crafted by the team of people who put them on. They are open to mixed-sex couples, female-only couples, and single females. The events are private parties, so membership is required. The membership fee is very nominal, though, and the benefits are great!

You can confront her but don't go blabbing off to your father.  You never know what can go thru a person's mind if they hear something like that.  The consequences can be beyond what u think.|`|949a6a5e8887c211b40643e61bf4dbb6aa	First tell him that you feel your mom is doing things that are not right,then tell him what they are and leave it up to him to investagate the situation.This y your not telling on your mom to your dad and your only alerting your dad to open his eyes up and see what might be going on.|`|c68a17e109da6ad7e746e95b35c962c7aa	I would do nothing.Why? Because it is really not your business,they are grown,and one can assume that they can take care of themselves.Also,if you do tell,you will place yourself right in the middle of a squabble between your parents.Ever heard a cop talk about when he goes to a domestic disturbance both sides end up coming after him? Same difference.I would not say that you should lie if you are asked,but if you arent my advice is to stay out of it.Also,if you do say something,make sure you can prove it,or the doo doo will hit the fan for sure.|`|iBcAkAmPaa	I would say give her a warning first, so that she stops and give her reasonable time to comply.  Make sure she does keep her word; if she does not then tell your dad.
cd4facfabbe9f3181d3eb2aba5693595aa	Well if you want any guy your picture will do that. Even 58 yr old men would go for that.<br>  But then you won`t find a guy who loves you. I presume that is what you want, some one to love you not just someone to use your hole for sex.<br>  <br>  Dress nicely be open and friendly, available for conversation to most. Be discerning on what you want in a man. Be hard to get when it comes to sex don`t offer yourself on a platter.<br>  <br>  You want a mature male. He is out there but he won`t find you if your swarmed with males in a feeding frenzy to deposit their sperm. He also won`t want you.<br>  <br>  The mature male wants a woman that can be his "best friend" and be a life mate. The mature male lives for one thing, approval from his woman. That may sound crazy but its true. He doesn`t care what she looks like he just enjoys being around her always and would do anything to keep that.<br>  Unhappy men are those that don`t get approval from their women. Eventually they leave. You are the control factor in this.<br>  <br>  Look around at the married couples that are happy. Would you consider her a beauty. Probably not. But he does. He goes to bed with her every night and makes love to her (great sex) and works hard to provide for her and defend her. Her approval makes him want more so he strives to get that approval.<br>  If you just provide sex you will not find that mature, good guy. You want that guy that has gone without sex for nearly a year that gets down on his knees and begs,, pleads,, for you to marry him.<br>  <br>  good question, glad you asked.|`|IYgXf15Eaa	Start talking to them...|`|0EcHEkstaa	just lay like that u ll get all|`|RvasVrWlaa	huh?|`|p57bym6faa	Well, that's a tricky one, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Cliche of the day: "Be yourself."  And then go through life being who you are, doing what you like to do, pursuing your dreams.  You'll find your mate, but it may not be who you were expecting.<br>  <br>  If you want to just get laid.  Go down to the local bar. Get drunk.  Hit on anything that moves.  Of course there may be a downside to that approach.
p57bym6faa	Pathetic.|`|b8d855de86d957cda28795b9f344ce1aaa	if you  talk like you type its prolly cuz ur a retard|`|3ClDzjmXaa	What do you mean? why do people like friends? <br>  <br>  Well i like having my friends because i know i matter to them. and it feels good to make a difference in someones life in that kind of way. it feels really nice to be appreciated. And who appreciates you the way friends do? i mean it all depends on the kind of friends you have too. <br>  But all in all my answer to this is lame but true: Love. People like friends--i like friends--because friends love you. They care. who in the world doesnt want to be loved?<br>  <br>  if you really dont have any friends maybe you just need to put yourself out their and socialize a little. It takes time i guess.
N5qBlf8zaa	Huh please re write your question.|`|d030fd77a63903f64682a8941f12a895aa	i don't understand i think you should delete your question and rewrite it

nqHrIPk7aa	If she won't believe you - that's her problem.  Getting involved into the situation any more than that is unnecessary.  Life isn't about being a contestant on the Jerry Springer show... if your friend doesn't want to hear it or is happy being ignorant about the matter then never mention it again.  Ultimately you will be able to say, "I told you so."
AA12066168	What you should do is end the separation and move back in with your wife.  You are suffering the drawbacks of being married without enjoying the benefits.  Get back together, work on your marriage, and get back into life.<br>  <br>  When you show up at the door, quote her this: "And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."|`|03fdfbad3d1df22a7a62baa6c6a64663aa	file if you wish.

You are both in danger financially and with personal property.<br>  <br>  Contact an attorney to find out all of your options.|`|AA10215956	So whats the problem? If she won't do it then you go file.

Its obvious the two of you are sex dead anyway which there is nothing wrong with that wish alot more where like you . Stay the way you are and be happy .
oDzOYMjDaa	I'm used to not always getting kisses every day... but if my S/O was there to give me a kiss, yes, I'd want them to kiss me every day. When he was around before I would want a lot of kisses throughout the day... but that's because I spent the rest of my time missing him... I don't think I'd be too picky though, to be honest... A few kisses here or there is fine, as long as when I'm in the mood for one I'm not denied for no reason...|`|okXvWN5haa	alot :)|`|cb4HEkGhaa	I like lots of kisses throughout the day and i would probably be upset if I went one day without a kiss from my  partner|`|FFE9Qztzaa	I wouldn't mind only getting 1 kiss from my partner for the whole day.  His love and care would simply be represented in that single kiss. and I wouldn't ask for nothing better. That would suffice for me to keep me happy and with a permanent smile on my face :)      Upset: maybe.. depends if he had been having a busy day.. or just lots on our minds, that we wouldn't have time for ourselves.
bYoKSMNKaa	I hear you! I too have a hubby in the construction industry, not getting paid and in the past i have been so gutted about having not $2 to buy bread yet shipping off a cheque for support. Before everyone jumps on me - I know they are his kids and his responsiblilty but its really hard to take food outta your own kids mouths to support his ex. Its hard not to feel bitter! We have shelled out support to mum and then had to give the kids money directly to pay for things that support should cover but cos hes a good dad he pays it for them so they dont miss out. Problem is I then have to work to support mine and his family. It used to put such a strain on our marriage and I was going to leave so many times. You are brave to say it cos all the ex wives go batshit if u say this **** but its hard and we can have a tantrum every now and again! Good luck!|`|SawySuLRaa	What a mess.........|`|41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	Did you think about this before you married him?! The kids were there before you so get over it. Do you know how bitter the kids can be when they have a deadbeat parent who actually has a spouse who has the gall to have resentment because you married the loser who wasn't current or did think "well golly gee, construction business can be unstable let me do something on side to make sure I don' have any problem later?!" so he wouldn't be behind on his child support!
59RrQSqLaa	But she want's it... so go with the flow... you are at dead end
aDL7xmt6aa	Don't give away your power.|`|IvMPh09baa	I suggest counseling... sounds like a co-dependency more than low self-esteem.  From what you said, you are basing your emotional well-being on your relationship and how your husband treats you.  This is co-dependency.  You and you alone are in control of how you feel, how you react, etc.  You need to start to re-train your mind into thinking for yourself... not just your husband... I suggest counseling because his behavior are feeding this and in order for it to change and get better you both need to work at it.|`|ScHW4842aa	I feel like that sometimes too. We have lots in common.     I am 18 - married - working full time - and completeing school too!     Youve got to harness that unsureness and all the other feelings in you and turn it into.. welll.. i hate to say it.. but anger. Anger gives you determination. You had a tough childhood - so did I . It is what drives me. I dont even think about what I do half the time. I just DO it - because I have a feeling inside me like I have to prove that I can, all by myself.     I suggest focusing on all the hardships of your life that you have ever endured, and allowing yourself to feel that anger that will drive you.     Try it.|`|3ijLQe5laa	you married too young!!!|`|tZ3jcxvjaa	See a Doctor to rule out any physical aspects.|`|f0HneGCiaa	Start by taking a good look at all "you" have accomplished for yourself by yourself. Whatever your arguments are about, the fact that he has to leave to cool down tells me they are very emotionally draining for you. Focus on the "Solutions" to your problems instead of arguing about the problem. Talk to each other, instead of yelling at each other. Really listen to each other and don't interrupt. Work together as a team and commit to each of you doing your part to make it work. Find out what "exactly do you expect" and want from each other. Most of the time the problem is communication and commitment. It takes work to make a marriage and you will only get out of it what you put into it. It doesn't take luck, it takes it takes teamwork.   Remember, SELF confidence and Self independence means building your own self up, no one can take it away unless you give it away by allowing yourself to believe things others say about you that are not true. It doesn't matter what others think of you, what matters is what you think of yourself.
6a572f4b6f26a4c454781621261ee067aa	give him another chance|`|6rxOjhk4aa	well talk to him, whatever you had a problem with him before , talk about why, then if that goes well ,start dating him again. make sure though you have the pervious problems that you hated him for resolved, or they will come up again
Prm2Uq00aa	I would tell him that its true, tell him how you feel. If he's asking you he probably is interested in you still or else he wouldn't bring that up.  and you'll probably end up back together if that's what you both want, but if its not what you want then tell him it's not true.    Hope I helped.|`|zxk9CMACaa	I think he just looking for free sex.  The question you have got to ask your self is are you.  If you are still in school and it gets around that your into FWB are you ready for all the poss-able ramifications
RD05jXYwaa	if that is all you want why not be truthful? tmm in all things be true.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Say yeah its true but it developed into more aka your relationship. Say I'm not looking anymore so he won't feel dejected or anything.|`|fSSE9cnLaa	there is no guy on this earth that would deny a fwb unless they are gay. yes tell him!
fdkbcFpbaa	You are just depressed ( lol, obvious, after 2 people said the same thing).   may be something in your past is bugging you, i dont know.  we, teenagers, stress out for no reason. i guess it's just a part of growing up.   ask God to take all of your big and small burdens away, and you'll be okay.  it happens to everyone. just dont let ur emotions take hold of you, i guess.  and yes, the poems are nice too.|`|78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	Well, I'm the same. I used to write poems, and it's also depressing, but nobody has told me how it is or if it made any sense. You thing that somethings wrong with you, but really you're not. We all feel like that, but it's only natural for us to feel how we feel.|`|YzWfAmn1aa	Everyone gets depressed so it nothing to worry about.If you get thoughts of killing yourself talk to a adult you trust.If you are depressed for more than a month you need to get help.  Don't worry the world loves you: D !!!
AU4LAtqMaa	watev is most comfortable for you.  i just do it in confidence!  everyone has it!if they dont have it they will!  change with confidence and just smile and laugh if someone says something!|`|w2yh8Acraa	tampons are better, they work better, they are more comfortable, and you cant see it!|`|qmPriTRfaa	then in P.E,  change in the washroom stalls. ?  duh.|`|RfNb4lC9aa	Awe, huni. Im so sorry that your faced with this decision. I remember when i was.     Lemme help you out a little bit. Tampons are very hard to get stuck. The only way you can is if some way your gonna shove the applicator in there someway that i don't think that a vagina was meant to stretch to. They very quite simple to use, and if you dont feel confortable to go for it alone, then talk to an older woman that you trust to go to with this stuff like a Mom, older sister, aunt or grandmother.    Now, with pads, i never EVEr got made fun of when i had used a pad when i was in Jr. high for wearing them, evey woman in her life will get her period. nothing to be ashaed of. If you wanna wear pads, then wear them! if you wanna wear tampons, then wear them!
1wGJ0iziaa	mmmm...i was in a situation like this with a birthday party...this is tough.  Don't be mean, but don't confront her.  That shows too much goody goody...All i did was i made everything i said to her short and blunt.  Dont let her think your okay with it, but dont let her think it affects you either...play it realll cool:)
FMcu6BNpaa	You don't have to be on either side. You should sit back and see what will  happen next. If it starts to get ugly try to calm both down. If they turn out not to be friends anymore then you CAN stay friends with BOTH of them. If they don't want you to hang out with the other friend then they might not be what you think they are.    Hopefully everything turns out ok!|`|QCWrISuDaa	don't worry i am in the same sittuation well this is what i did i told both of them this is ur guys problome and im cut in the middle i also told both of them to confront each other instead for me to hear both sides of them

JVSMpFq2aa	14- 96  I have an eating disorder too =[  but im doing perfect with help of my friends =]  good luck|`|jcbLxap0aa	i wont judge you but you doo need help weather its from a friend or a parent  in 14 i weigh120 but im not fat most of it is on my boobs im a double d and im average size. and im short 5'1 ok i hope im helpful
PxVDtnSzaa	Or just talk to a mentor.. Back in high school, I talked to my favorite teacher. Especially because you recognize that you have this eating disorder. Eating disorders kill people if they go on long enough. Even if you do it short term, you can experience physical side effects that you really really would not want to experience. You need to stop. For your health, both physically and mentally.|`|lHDq5gEraa	i'm like 5'4 and 115. You should eat a little more no offense to you you know? Its not pretty to be super skinny!|`|KOIAbPsWaa	WOW you are really skinny I'm 13 and about 5'3 and weigh about 112 and most of my friends weigh more and are the same height and they call me skinny. So you are skinny and should eat I'm not trying to be mean but it's unhealthy for you and I know someone who had an eating disorder but it's better to eat.
Hdgl27hDaa	cuz they need attention dude, if you want to get back at em, for making fun of you or for whatever reason, say at least im not a shallow tramp who gossips about other peoples problems  and some will, some wont|`|AdTnizwOaa	Well, I am a teenage girl. But I can just say that it's to "fit in", I think some girls try to be "cool" so they do what guys do. Be loud and obnoxious, and they, we, tend to over do it. They think they are having fun, and yes they will grow out of it. I think. Well, I mean you don't see adults always loud, pointing and laughing do you? :)    So basically it's their way to show they are dominant from others (i guess you could say), to either try and fit in, or a chaotic way to have fun..     Ha ha, sorry!|`|2TDtOdltaa	well not all of them are like that. lol at least im not. but i suppose they'll stop their childish games eventually.|`|0nW8wMBdaa	No they turn into "Sex and the City" (-:|`|qpGbQ3Zlaa	Eventually, when the mature.|`|6tA4eksTaa	i hate girls like that but please remember that not all girls are like that     believe it or not something might have happened to that girl so she is looking at another girls' flaws to make herself feel better or they simply don't care about the people and are very cruel hopefully they will grow out of it but like i said not all teenage girls are like that|`|3MngBccTaa	im suree we girls can fine MANY things wrong with guys..  like will you guys ever grow out of being jerks?
TD0aaSQQaa	its because im hardheaded and i dont want to tell you all that mushy gushy stuff unless ive had some booze in me!|`|J4hsuTzxaa	cause shes horny and she knows you got the dong|`|1keH3R6paa	She's tipsssyyyyyy!|`|DUPOEk1daa	It's not that she loves you more...She just lets go of everything else.|`|qfmTWB9Saa	She doesn't love you more. She loves you the same.   She DOES, on the other hand, want to have sex with you more.  Welcome to the world of alcohol. It affects different people in different ways.    Atleast she doesn't love 'everybody' when she's drunk.|`|VV4LlmxZaa	ha ha, she doesn't love you more when she is drunk. alcohol just helps people relax and be out there more... and in some cases makes them horny.|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	LOL LOL lol
SptW7fDCaa	lol, if it makes you feel better tell him off. He deserves it. He sounds like such a jerk.    If you really want to hurt him, just be nice. What would hurt him more than knowing that he let some wonderful, beautiful, and kind woman get away?|`|PyGMZPHGaa	wtf, that's just mean|`|0ky4TktEaa	Congrats on wanting to behave like a child. Telling a guy off for being an @ss is one thing. Trying to eliminate all self esteem is too far. It should suffice to tell him he had his chance and blew it; now, you're not interested. If he keeps going, just hang up the phone and call it a day. Have the number blocked for phone calls and messaging so he won't run up the bill.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Let me guess, he used you for sex and dumped you.  Maybe he might want another hop in the sack,but insulting him will not hurt him hon.  He knows there are more girls out there ready to drop their panties for him in a heart beat so why should he worry about one who is bitter?  Just tell him you have nothing to say to him that he falsely accused you of cheating and you do not like to be falsely accused and dumped.Tell him a "REAL" man would have had the guts to tell you the truth that:" he did not find you compatible and he thinks it'd be best if he moved on".  Then tell him you have moved on and so should he, then hang up.|`|CaKu7gbAaa	Don't speak such kind of childish things, you too are totally involve in this relation. as sometimes these indecent boys can ruin reputation or can try to harm too. you better tell him that you are not reliable and not worthy of my true love and me and you don't want to continue relation with you because of your attitude and I can't take it any more, you are free to find any other girl, who can tolerate your such behavior. so don't disturb me and don't call me at all.    take care
DxYwNFdhaa	My weee cousin is called freya.  I think its a lovely name :-) She blonde with blue eyes and she is very artistic and quiet.
FJigVylKaa	hahaha your Freya, that's funny. How the hell would we know what kind of chick you are from your name ahahaha thank you for making me laugh that hard.|`|wUbvU3aiaa	Since when does the name matter, Freya?  xD
bQisGgSsaa	Do anything he ask you to do.|`|rAa8bfhwaa	Magic potion|`|sQBcIcAnaa	I hate to break it to you hunny but you cannot  (( make )) no one like or love you And especially if he is into someone else                              My advice to you is that you first have to love your self and feel comfortable with who you are work on making your self attractive  what i mean is find a feature of your self and use that learn to make intelligent  conversation  know when to wink at a guy and when to flirt with him but to be successful at flirting you must have confidence in your self and your assets if you know what i mean     My friend if hes in to her means hes not all that in too you that doesn't make you less then the other girl sometimes that's just the way love goes  "se la vie"  make him notice you by being  you ok|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	Remember, before a guy can like you, he has to notice you.   Find reasons to be near enough for him to notice. Join clubs you know he attends and you know you can enjoy. Many clubs and activities are designed to take you out of your comfort zone, so be aware of what you're signing up for. Don't sign up for anything way over your head or just plain wrong for you.   Let him know you are there: Say hi. Say good-bye. Wave at him. When he replies back to you, you know he's noticed you. Don't expect any guy to notice anyone, it doesn't always work that way.   Become comfortable around him.   Flirt with him in a playful and friendly way, but don't go overboard! Try this: Look at him until he looks at you. Then when he looks at you, turn away. Then, look at him again. Yes, this is a very simple yet very effective way to flirt.   Let him know you are there for him. Find ways to let him know you want to talk with him about anything. Notes work. Texting can too.   If you can see he has a problem, no matter how big or small, be there for him. The more often he can lean on you emotionally, the stronger your bond of friendship will be. Almost all guys like to be comforted. Some show it differently than others. Some guys don't like to be comforted except by close trusted friends.   Never expect his trust, but always do whatever you can to earn his trust. Never betray his secrets. Never blab what his problems might be.   When he starts to let you be close to him, try to be his friend-- not his girlfriend, not anything special, but his friend. Leave it up to him to decide how intimate each of his friends should be. There is no such thing as a girlfriend who isn't first and foremost a friend. In fact, the best girlfriend is one who is not always romantic, but one that is like a friend. Do not rush into any other kind of relationship with him.   Find the value in his opinions and suggestions. This does NOT mean to betray or belittle your own beliefs. Yours are every bit as important as his. Discuss them when you can. If you don't think you can agree, find one more question to ask about them, or let him know you need to find one more question... never condemn his ideas just because you disagree with any of them. The good men out there like girls with their own opinions. It gives you something important to talk about.   When the two of you are comfortable, it might be ok to drop a few hints that you are interested in becoming more than an ordinary friend. Notes work. Texts, too.   Some guys your own age might not get the hint. Girls do usually reach puberty earlier than guys, so girls usually reach that level of emotional maturity earlier as well. So, you might just have to come out and tell him. This can be difficult and embarassing, but, it's better to try and fail than to never try and still fail, because at least after trying, you will know.   Guys will often let you know if he's interested in you or not without putting any words to it. There will be a part of you that will be able to tell by instinct. If you aren't sure, and he doesn't put a rejection into words, chances are that he is trying to spare hurting your feelings. Don't push for a more clear answer. Just drop it-- the part about being more than an ordinary friend. You cannot force him to like you any more than he already does. Remain friends. Even if you decide to part company with him, remain friends.. true friends.. trustworthy friends.   The obvious unspoken sign of liking you is hugging or holding hands. Sometimes the sign is more subtle, like a new way of smiling at you, or even more subtle like watching his pupils (the black spots in the middle of his eyes) dilate (grow bigger) when he looks at you. Sometimes his irises will change color slightly. (dont trust too many other minute-by-minute changes to his anatomy. Some of those changes, even the more obvious ones, are completely random in very young men for several years.)   If you are a pre-teen and he kisses you... be wary. He is probably rushing things too fast for both of you. Kissing might be better off avoided until late teens or even later.|`|FaUNLyUraa	ok just make him laugh.. flirt with him .. play "tag games" like u poke each other in the stomach.. text him.. say wats up?  just show him u have a good personality and he will like u   xooxoxx|`|nz5HkSPiaa	have faith in god only he is the one who can help in any of lifes downfalls|`|GAxHzgEEaa	well you cant really get a guy to like you because you will have to act a certain way all the time!    but if you wanted to try anyways  get a friend to ease into a  conversation with him  and find out what he likes about girls and what he looks for  then dont make it so obvious  but once you get the information, start to make a transformation over the next couple of days    you sound like a great girl  good luck & i hope my advice works|`|QGTqlppGaa	you can't make a guy like u|`|3QG6WLXXaa	get a makeover|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	You can not.|`|MfUMaKcDaa	that's impossible, it just happens|`|Tg6ySuUOaa	PERSONALITY!

If you act different than you really are, people [especially him] aren't going to appreciate that.     Probably doesn't help, but I hope it does.|`|z8AlY7Vmaa	Well..you cant make him like you.

kqa9VFrfaa	U R a rare man, and every mother's dream for her daughter, if indeed U R for real. When a man has sex for the first time it is better than any other time in his life. To be able to share that with a wife would be a priceless treasure. Too many modern humans do not honor this ritual in their sexual experiences . What a shame that people are so greedy and needy. Too bad peer pressure ruins so many wonderful things about relationships.   What this country passes off for sex ed is pitiful. The nerve endings that get triggered a special way for the first few times a person has sex can never do that again. And yet billions of people waste that precious ritual of love. U R young and have the rest of your life for sex. There is so much else to do on this planet also.   My first experience with sex was rape, so I missed out on a lot in my youth, and my husband has also suffered because of this. Little do most people know sex as a treasured thing. They only treat it as a sport. What a shame. You are a wise soul. Any woman who would dishonor you, doesn't deserve you. Your parents should be proud of you too.   I hope you find someone as special as U R.|`|M2JNgbI1aa	like i said before  its sweet when guys keep there virginity  cuz most guys brag about it|`|vkeuaEHiaa	That's a sign of good integrity and will. I would prefer a virgin, since I am one. It's good that you are a virgin by choice.|`|tC6MG0nyaa	virgin is definitely not a turn off for me... its ur choice.. stick to it..|`|nkGHpVghaa	Im sorry to say, I''m not a virgin..but I deffinatley would want  my guy to be a virgin...theres just something special about it. So actually its a BIG turn on. =D|`|l0muvHB7aa	mm no my boyfriend was virgin but he didn't tell me until we have sex...  ii is not a bad thing to be a virgin  and i wish he would have told me, it would be more special than it was for both of us|`|rv7Lh0cuaa	i think its a turn on  since i am a virgin too i think its a really good thing and i would rather a guy like that    proud to be a virgin 2 :)|`|HKkbqlIuaa	It depends on how you look at it, I suppose. My fiance and I were both virgins when we first had sex. It made me feel a lot more comfortable that we were each others' firsts because I didn't feel inexperienced. If you're waiting for marriage or your life partner, it's probably going to be a turn on. However, if you are just waiting.. Most girls are going to find it a turn off. I think you should do what makes you feel most comfortable though. I was glad that I waited. I think your future wife would be happy to know she was your first. Anyone that truly loves someone won't care if it's your first time or not.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	keep your virginity!!! i mean, its not worth it when all the girls want you for is your body. just saying.|`|gnIEDg6maa	First, have you ever fantasied about having sex with a man?  Just consider that question before we go any further. If you have fantasised about other men, DO NOT have  a relationship with a girl.  It would not be fair to her if you were  dating her just to avoid disappointing your parents or out of fear, denial or embarrassment because you do not want to be  homosexual.  I know men hate to disappoint their dads and moms but sometimes it is necessary and you can find lots of support and advice on the internet. If you are heterosexual, you will not have fantasized about men.  I am asking this because most heterosexual men do not refuse to have sex with a girl but I am sure some do because of  valid reasons like a strong belief that it is a sin and a belief that you should be married first.  Now, as to your question, I like seducing guys, so you would be sexy to me.  Some girls like and need an experienced man as they are shy themselves.  Read some good books so you have some idea how to proceed.  Be sure and tell her it is your first time.  That is important!  Then she will not expect much and will probably enjoy teaching you to do the things she likes and giving you little thrills.  You will probably ejaculate very fast the first time. Don't worry.  Just wait a little while and do it again.  That time will last longer. Do not expect the girl to climax.  It is very hard for a man to make a girl do that.  Most girls just fake it to make the man happy and keep him from feeling inadequate. This doesn't mean you should not try to help her climax.  The trying is a lot of fun for the girl and when she gets tired, she will fake it and everyone goes to sleep happy.  The girl is happy because she got lots of loving and the man is happy because he ejaculated and satisfied the girl. She will take care of herself later.  The clitoris is in a spot impossible for the penis to rub against  during intercourse.  It takes friction on the clit to reach an orgasm.  You can do it for her with your finger but it is very sensitive  and again, really hard to get it just right, not too hard and not to easy, not too fast and not too slow.  Keep trying though.  That's where the fun is for the girl.  I know, men just want to do it as fast as possible and go to sleep.  What was God thinking, anyway?|`|I9dw8eWsaa	i dont think it is....proud 2 b a virgin too|`|wUbvU3aiaa	You ask this question alot. -_-  And being a virgin isn't bad. I'm happy that I'm one.|`|J4hsuTzxaa	REPOST:WHO CARES|`|G8Y07MTeaa	LOL THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY BUT IAM A VIRGIN LOL|`|IFtKzGN0aa	umm its would b weird but then again alright because u know he hasn't been with other girls with diseases|`|rPH05I2jaa	For my first time i'd love to have someone who is also a virgin it would be that much better because you never forget your first time and sharing it with someone who also want to share there first time with you would be the best thing ever and wonderful|`|rlQymP7waa	Its not a turn off and its not a turn on. Honestly I think it is irrelevant. If you really love someone, their past sexual history will be of no importance to you--whether their experience be limited or excessive.|`|cUslVzhVaa	Personally, i wouldn't want to be with someone who wasn't experienced.  But then again, its deff cool that you have control.   It goes both ways  And in this case, i feel your personality has more to do with it|`|FCDLP2pGaa	then it was good that she dumped you because you want to wait and she dose not so it was doomed from the start|`|aCjkylb1aa	WHAT THE FK ARE U TALKING ABOUT! NO SHTHEAD WANTS A PROMISCUOUS GUY/GIRL ITS OF COURSE BETTER TO BE A VIRGIN.    Its only the wild sort of girls who are turned off, You should find someone really worth it. Someone who values sex and not treats it as a pasttime.    ITs good to get dumped by ur gf for not wanting sex, cos now u know she's nth but a btch|`|9CRVJRB3aa	I like a guy who has had some experience, but some girls like virgins so its all about personal preference.|`|r3G9ANyXaa	No way, you should be proud to be a virgin I am the same age and still a virgin. Don't think just because your ex girlfriend dumped for not having sex with her, doesn't mean that all girls are like that. Most girls aout there, prefer a boyfriend who doesn't sleep around with different girls. So no, it is not a turn off....|`|blRAepCVaa	Im a virgin too and let me tell you its an awesome thing, ur respected more, and I would like a guy to experience something with me for the time and not with someone else in the past, it brings people closer.  But different women have different preferences, if a girl is really serious about you then I think she would love the fact you are a virgin and for being to share that with her..|`|EmC8wvMsaa	NON non petit monsieur, take the lemon and eat it and then throw it and then regret throwing it because there was still juice inside and then take it out of the garbage and suck on it. LMAOOO JK    real answer: As a matter a fact, we women DONT CARE! You might be afraid that you don't have any experience, but its all about learning. VIRGINS ARE TURN ONS!|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Thats just unnatural and weird. Either you have a tiny endowment, and are using virginity as a way to avoid sexual contact, or your a hardcore god botherer thats been brainwashed, or you have sexual/mental issues. Its always one, or the other.|`|jqKbyzQdaa	be proud to be a virgin. i am.|`|zxnvdSS3aa	I'm totally turned on by a guy who believes in absedance|`|zvHYxpVCaa	i dont think it's bad.  i'd actually prefer to be with one, because then i would never be pressured into anything i wasnt ready for :]
znjl6WrWaa	well my husband was born in the Philippines and came over here when he was a teenager. He said that there was a fascination for both men and women with white people because they are exotic. They're different. Same reason why men over here love brazilian women and asian women.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	PPL (M/F) like exotic because they are different.|`|022a70c3422f4e77c8a63e672f7c2b18aa	Jobs.    jdk|`|8Fn1tYaJaa	You're asking why Filipino men living in the PH love girls from a distance?

How secure is your relationship with him.  Is he your boyfriend or husband?  Try something different.  He sounds like he is not really trying to please you.  Think about the relationship and if you find that all this sexing is what the relationship is made of, then dump his behind and when he asks why? say cause you are "tired"  many blessings|`|YlDp0Ikwaa	sounds like your spouse or whoever just wants to get it himself
AIftgLEGaa	it does sound like he's jealous. otherwise he wouldn't have gotten jealous like that. It's hard to say whether or not he will try to get you again. If he thinks you are going out with someone else, he may back off. But.. if he really is up for a challenge like you say, he may try to get you back. You may just have to wait and see. Please answer my questions too!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	He is acting more like he is 12 than 17.

4BoteYDwaa	He waves, that's a good sign, he cares. A lot of men like to be approached, he might be waiting for you. Use your charm and convince him that a night out would be really fun (movies and dinner or something), be persistent, but not eccentric. Ask him in person, don't send one of your friends as messenger (a lot of girls do this and we generally don't like it). He already said if it wasn't her, it would be you, so your work is half done. Ask him before he goes to the dance, give him something to think about. That way he may decline when the other girl asks him out. Your basically at war, apparently this other girl is fond of him. Don't be afraid to kiss him (on the cheek) if he agrees to the date, he'll be thinking about the kiss for the rest of the day.|`|XDla5bQNaa	He probably just thinks of you as a friend.  I liked a guy and it happened almost exactly like that.  We were friends at school and we used to talk to each other a lot.  And, then I asked him to a dance and he said the same thing, that he had already been asked (minus the "i would have gone with you").  But, he never did anything to seek me either.  It was the same situation, and as it turned out, he didn't like me that way, just as a friend.  It really broke my heart and it sucks!  But, you'll get through it!  I thought I never would but I did and I am happy that I am not with him because now I am with the love of my life!  |`|i9uK5ldSaa	dont talk for a while  let him be curious why arent you  andd if he says u didnt talk to me.  u sayy  well u couldve tlaked to me if u wanted.... ?  that way ur not always the one making the plans :D|`|5b2fd4a4183ac1d65721171ad7b2843caa	TALK TO HIM!!!! lol.
gI3aBxCuaa	Be friends with the little guy. Otherwise, just tell your friend that you feel uncomfortable with her brother tagging along, or tell her you want some space with her.
eNR2iot8aa	Small ego usually the guys with the big egos are big problems, and just cause headaches.|`|q2POh1dEaa	I like guys with a big ego.    Oh wait...im a guy  o.O    uhm..nevermind.
UlT5dByaaa	It depends on a guy.  I would love to cuddle after having sex.  Well, no.  I love to cuddle with the girl I love in general.|`|LnzkBhF9aa	There is a hormone released in a man's brain after he has an orgasm that makes him fall asleep immediately afterwards. So if your guy rolls over and falls asleep you shouldn't be offended. However, there are some rare guys out there who will cuddle after sex.     xoxo  Sarah
kEeUsdnYaa	Ah the online dating intro line question.  A phenomenon scientists have pondered for centuries.  I think Aristotles line was    "I'm Greek baby yeaaaaaah"    It failed miserably of course which drove him into obsession with philosophy.
LZzsDARUaa	I think it's a wonderful idea, but why can't u2 meet up even if she graduated, maybe 4 a coffee, at a table with no people  just tell her u got things on ur mind that would be easier 2 just talk 2 her  or maybe try messenger, but personally I like it when people r together in the same room as it's nicer and u could tell what the person feels 4 u
PxVDtnSzaa	Facebook is definitely not a good way to hook up. I'd try other things... Join a club or something! Just as soon as you convince a girl she likes you over facebook, you're going to have to confront your shyness to meet her anyway! And that would be even harder, because you will have never actually met her before.. Lies are NOT a good way to start out a relationship. Any relationship!|`|ptclgKl5aa	I don't bother with that, I might be able to make it work but I'd feel like a big huge creeper if I did that.|`|tUwXiYShaa	please don't do that sometime that just makes people think your like actually 40 year old men trying to hook a young girl... like a creep-o  sorry it's the truth though|`|5d5t1Rpeaa	hey your rather cute =)    that works for me     but you also have to be a good looking guy for that to work lol|`|qMp6Z6j6aa	Don't do it on FB. That always creeps me out. If you really need to talk online to build your confidence then go to a chat room or two. That way you won't be giving away too much info in case she turns out to be crazy or if it bombs. That way it's like practice runs and if it turns bad...no harm no foul. Once your confidence is built up then you can take it to real life. I get random guys that send me stuff on FB a lot and I think that's really creepy. I think most girls think that too. So like I said...if it's just to build up your confidence...try a chat room.|`|F08qx2hgaa	Heh, that is a bit of a "creeper" thing to do. Start with hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Just like you were going to; except fill in the somewhere. Knowing (or thinking you know) where you know her from is less creepy than implying that you might be stalking her...    If she responds, try posting a comment on one of her photos. Say something like, "Hey, this pic of you is really cute ;)". But mean it. Don't lie, or else it'll be as if you're trying to hook up, and you'll be like a player. A girl tells her friends who contacts her, her talks to her, etc. Don't say anything that could be taken wrong...    Are you gonna try to talk to them outside of facebook? From my experience (and because I am in fact female) girls find it weird if a guy talks on facebook, yet she hasn't talked to him/ vice versa.    If you aren't planning on going beyond internet flirting, you may want to just NOT facebook-flirt.
0093382286e191b54fe019326d1aa456aa	Just be yourself. If he can't talk to the real you, then what is the point in talking to him anyway?|`|80e633b65e83920a1bc9aa77ae22f787aa	try to sit next to him, somehow get near him. so then just say hi to him. but dont smile too much at first, just introduce yourself and ask casual things about him... then after that u can start being nice, smiling or laughing a little, talk about bands, ask if he likes that band u both like.
fBXRNKyuaa	No idea who you are.....sorry|`|ehmeG65gaa	If i was 15 then sure  problem is that when i actually was 15, a was shallow, confused and stupid  most women who see how great you are would go to jail if they dated you.|`|PpAb8fezaa	how about a picture?|`|01xjZhtRaa	you had me at lazy eye|`|W2pU2g9Eaa	Hey you can email me at vanilla.bean15@yahoo.com! Then we can chat bout all the rest!|`|9QUCw9Jnaa	sounds like my type as long as you care bout personality instead of looks then your fine.Also treat a lady how they should be treated.My email is carrie08794@yahoo.com. You could talk to me.
iWJ3BQQ9aa	c is cool|`|59RrQSqLaa	C if she is cute enough... otherwise I would cut her hand off and put it in a plastic bag|`|ktq7lF81aa	I say B, you don't want to be literally stuck to someone, no matter how cute, what happens to your privacy? haha    I guess it would be fun for a few hours though.|`|A4U5folvaa	If she is cute and I like her,    E: I'd convince her to go with me to the hardware store to un glue our hands and go somewhere afterward, if she feels she must hold my hand she can. Simple lol.
GGeijFl1aa	Go for it. As another Indian guy, albeit one who has -only- been in interracial relationships, I should tell you that you definitely need to get past any concerns about what other people (and maybe your parents, if they're that type) think seeing biracial couples. The girl seems like she likes you quite a bit, and vice-versa; there's no reason for you to throw what you -could- have away because you're afraid of what her "shallow" friends and random pedestrians might think. I've dated two predominantly Chinese girls, a half-Hispanic girl, and a few Caucasian girls, and I never noticed any weird looks or anything. Granted, there are the odd jerks polluting the world, but you'll need to learn to deal with them if you ever want to live your life.     Good luck.
6XoOiPY8aa	Honey, are you seriously letting him get away with that? It's not called pressuring him it's called setting standards. And that's bull-crap that guys don't like cuddling after-wards. My ex boyfriend loved cuddling after wards and he would always snuggle with me and caress me everywhere. You need to tell him that if he doesn't want to cuddle after having sex with you then he can just go to the bathroom and jerk off instead and that way he won't have to worry about anyone but himself. He is being a selfish a_shole and you deserve more than that. The whole point of being intimate with someone is to not be selfish and to do the touching and the kissing and the making sure the girl comes afterward and then cuddling until you fall asleep together. Sit him down and have a serious talk that your needs aren't being met and how it makes you feel when he doesn't touch you after being intimate. Ask him why he doesn't want to be touched. If he doesn't get better I would try to find a guy that is trying to please you as much as you want to please him. That's the whole point of being with someone, to make each other happy. Good luck!|`|JpmKtpqmaa	You can always just say something like "baby I really need to feel your hands around me" or just lay down on his chest and start playing with his fingers and make your fingers intertwine with his...and stuff like that..|`|YVRXdfGHaa	Time to find a new boyfriend. Any man who pays attention to or cares about his lady would know that the ladies need just as much attention and love afterward as before.    He's a selfish loser, interested in nothing but his own jollies. Best to get rid of him now. And you've put up with this for a year and a half? I'll never understand some people.|`|BL9CQgcAaa	maybe he dont wana touch you cos he cummed on you outside lol, or maybe his tired and wants to just relax but , cuddling and some more kissing wouldnt be bad unless he cummed in your mouth LOL|`|8Xud3vi8aa	b straightforward.  tell him if he wants the sex hes gonna hav 2 cuddle afterwards. and if he loves u he will b ok w/ doing sumthin 4 u|`|lWobDwmnaa	well i think you need to find a new boyfriend. he probably used you for sex. if he loves you now, he would be happy to cuddle with you.
shRGskJVaa	go to the cops, talk to your parents about it, lock the sicko up and if you take him to court do not! be afraid to testify against him.|`|xIYnWCedaa	tell your parents and take that bastard to court!|`|AA11961151	tell your parents first it is not your fault and he deserves to be punished for what he has done  How could you not tell anyone in the first place ?|`|4drQ38qZaa	Tell your parents, call the cops, get medical help, and a consular. Being raped is NOT a good thing. Good luck.|`|sYxtPBziaa	Okay, i remember you. You were on here not long ago asking if you should have sex right? Now you did. Now your pregnant. Happy? Can't just take somebodies advice for once in your life? Contact the autorities. You can get child support.|`|rrC72eBEaa	Because your only 13, your under the age of consent.  Talk to someone about it and take him to court for damages, because what happened is illegal.  The law is on your side, honey.|`|k8VrG7mzaa	Call the police, tell someone. That's a crime, and someone can find him. See a Planned Parenthood person ;)  |`|AA10349362	i agree with the first two answers.  go to your parents asap! this is   a serious situation
RD2xHWPoaa	I know exactly how you feel. It is like, sometimes you like him or her and sometimes you don't. It is just a big confusing mess and you never really know how to feel. In my case I had to just choose between liking him and not and I chose to. I think you just need to make choice and see where it goes from there... Good luck!!!
ddWyRjmVaa	yupp.
qBl9ShJBaa	my boyfriend told me he loved me a month after we started going out.and now we r married.|`|q2POh1dEaa	its never too early if its true    dont say it just cause your in a relationship with her though|`|E14cuDlZaa	If you feel its not the time yet my brother, than don't!!!   Things can wait and when the times right, you'll naturally say it. 2 Weeks just does not seem enough yet. Good Luck.
ZRRvnYMsaa	wow im the same age and size   your not that short  dont worry about it   im sure guys like that your short  and think about the bright side  whenever going out with someone you will be able to wear high heels without them feeling short! ?|`|comuT2fkaa	no way! you're pretty tall for that age i think.  i was way shorter than you when i was 13.  i'm a 15 year old hs sophomore and i'm only 5'2 right now.|`|oC3J9mckaa	I'm shorter than you are. I'm 14 and I'm 4'10"|`|4ujEpNLsaa	You still might grow some more.  If you stay that height the rest of your life you will definately be short. I think more guys prefer real short girls than real tall girls so its okay. Hope this helps.|`|JXpU6ro4aa	yea you r short, i don't like girls that are really short cause it makes me feel that i am older then her. i'm 6 ft so i like my girls about 5'8"
VCfk5ZQbaa	It means that he's almost positive that you're going to tell her that he likes her, he's not sure if he wants to start a relationship with her, and he just needs some time.  He does like your friend.  He just doesn't want to admit it.  Is he a player?  If he is, leave him alone.  If he isn't, tell your friend that he does like her and she should go for it!|`|ZRRvnYMsaa	he might like both of them stay away if he askes one of them out you never know what might happen someones heart could be broken...
sXerTGooaa	i'm definitely considerate no matter who it is, i can't help but feel their pain  i know what it's like when i'm sad and i want someone to be considerate 2|`|WdhwDfHSaa	considerate|`|XbsuY1ogaa	I'm borderline, but tend to be more sarcastic, only because I'm worried that my feelings won't be reciprocated.|`|1keH3R6paa	Definitely considerate of others feelings. Sarcasm makes me sick.|`|DxYwNFdhaa	Depends who its with and the situation !!!  I tend to be more considerate but if its a guy sumtimes I might be sarcastic so he doesn't feel weird !!
Y8l895Hyaa	definitely a turn on for me|`|Gslf19Uvaa	haha.............ya.     if the guy is right.|`|zg6sgA3faa	Depends on the mood
QkmoNX2Qaa	If you don't want to go then dont??    But anyway, if you do, who cares if you go alone. You won't seem like a loner.  Maybe you'll see some-one you know there and just ask if you can sit with them or some-thing.  How about you just ask around, maybe an old friend you havn't seen in a while. Just txt the people on your cell and invite them to come!   If no-one can then just go alone. Don't worry about the people that you may see there. You won't be a loner or thought of that way. Because if I see someone at the mall by themselves I dont really think much of it.  You may feel like a loner but people probably won't see you as one.  Just appear to be confident and enjoy the game!  xx   Hope it helped|`|7ef54de89410c20c50a741d45f955f77aa	it's always fun to go with friends.so i'd ask other friends if they wanted to go.if that fails and you really want to go, go.don't let what others think keep you from doing things|`|A4U5folvaa	Sure why not. Take a camera if you can, go out there and enjoy the game. I once bought 2 tickets to a New York Yankees game, only thing was it was a day game, most of my friends were in school or working, so I had to go by myself, I thought it would be weird, turns out I had fun anyways, the fans sitting next to me talked with me about game, I ate, Took a few pics of the players, had some good laughs and we won. Oh yeah Johnny Damon hit a grand slam too =P lol. Yeah so if no one you know is there, watch the game maybe take a few pics, have fun. Is this a High school game or like NBA? College?|`|JTSBWpbraa	ya i think basketball is a fun sport and if you go by yourself 1 time ur not antisocial
8b0564e4f294954027d36b00630751e6aa	Hi Terry, I am not sure if I am looking under the right web-site you have listed are you a dot.com, dot.org, dot.edu....    In answer to your question: If I could talk to a man the way I talk to my best-friends and he responded in the same manner as those friends of course I would be pleased.     But, for some reason when a man is attracted to a woman and vise versa the expectations are not equal to what you would expect in a best-friend of the same gender. I have seen relationships including mine fall apart because when the rose colored glasses come off and you have to ask yourself "Do opposite really attract?" or "Does like equal like?" where do you fall.     I believe Like equals Like, so for the "Trust your Soul to", a man would have to be an amazingly secured person being a man, to feel safe enough to appreciate a woman for how she is, flaws and all.
aLgY4l3Naa	I think because your NOT making it PERFECTLY CLEAR you are done with him!! When you tell him you are through but then respond to his tex's or take his phone call, he is not hearing you don't want to be with him, what he is hearing is that your still interested, PLAIN AND SIMPLE!! If you REALLY don't want to be with him make it perfectly clear, don't respond to tex's, don't take phone calls and if he comes around your house call the cops and if needed get a restraining order, and then he will let go, the ball is in your court so what ever happens is determined on how you play it!! Remember a guy will only go as far as a woman lets him!! Good luck to you and i hope you do the right thing for you!!|`|qfgb1eNpaa	just tell him to buzz off if its annoying you. you shouldnt hang on to guys your suspicious about. its not fun.
3SUjApfSaa	Cleveland Steamer  868 up, 294 down    A Cleveland Steamer is one of two acts that are similar for the scatalogically inclined. One is a crude sex act the other a crude break up technique. Both are the same thing.     1. You take a dump on a lovers chest while or before titty ******* (if that partner is a female.) Generally for the cacaphile only or as a domination and humiliation tool in BDSM games. See also Brown Showers. The steamer part is that it is very probably steaming from the freshness (Moisture rising from it) not to do with "steamrolling" it. Then it would have been called a "Cleveland Steamroller". It is probably named after Cleveland (Lucky us Clevelanders) because of the brown stripe left behind resembling the brown stripe on the orange Cleveland Browns Football Helmet. If you squish it down and then you spooge on it for syrup it becomes a "Boston Pancake". Don't know the origin of Boston in refernce to that act.     2. Often used as a breakup technique for angry lovers to wait till the other is asleep and dumping on their chest and leaving them to wake in it the morning after. Point made. Sexual intercourse isn't necessary beforehand technically. It is only for extra points with your pals since you obviously are only pretending to be making up and having sex to achieve this goal and are tricking the other person to get even. Usually done without knowledge of the victim if the "pooper" wants to escape alive.       Tom wanted to break up with Sally after their last fight and he made his point to her by dropping her a Cleveland Steamer and leaving the bedroom.
0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	i suspect you are correct. many marriages will split as a result of our very difficult economy with fewer good paying jobs.    what people need to do is to look to mom and dad to see if they can move home and save money. they can pay significantly reduced rent and  mom and dad will have a little more money.    unfortunately, most people are too proud, without reason, to move in with mom & dad, after saying its rough out here, i need to move in with my wife until things get better.    families sharing was one of the survival tools throughout  american history. however, today the lowest paid person is too proud to face the fact that they can't make it on their own. so the idea is to dump the wife or husband becomes common.    fortunately, there are many of us who have the good sense to see the writing on the wall before the ink dries and move home right quick. for the others, they slip down  another several notches and it becomes very difficult for them to rise up when conditions improve.    family support in important.|`|zDmGngXVaa	I think that is just wrong!! Plain wrong!!!! My husband is laid off but I didn't marry him because of his job, I married him because of him! I don't know why people do such thing. I understand that they are scared and all but sheesh they don't have to make the emotion more worse on the men! I know when my husband got laid off, yeah I was scared but leaving him never came across my mind!  "When you get married the vows are spoken 'rather rich or poor'"|`|8nGZV6ufaa	I agree with the sadness of this situation.  Seems whenever money comes into an important role...everything else is side lined.  Makes no sense...because what does money have to do with "love"???  I don't get it.  I guess that is what separates the ones who truly have love as a foundation to weather the storm, and the ones that just base their relationship on the shallowness of money and material things.  Just once, I'd like to hear of a modern day romance...one that is just a bond that won't be smashed.  Guess I'm just a hopeless romantic.  Take care.|`|SawySuLRaa	Women go into marriages for the security it provides for them and the children. When the security is gone then there is no need to stay in the marriage and they run to the available form of security.    That is nature at it's best.|`|aLgY4l3Naa	Well in today's society you really don't need to be going through a bad economy crisis!! Today people are so loose and free, values and morals have fallen by the way side that they will walk out on their partner for anything, because no one believes in sticking to the marriage vow "FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE" the economy is not causing the failing of marriages the people are!! No one understands what REAL COMMITMENT is, its only a word with no real meaning!! This is truly sad and people just don't realize this awful truth!!|`|AA12187979	For thoes marriges based on the wrong things yes.
7cjqT33Baa	If you contact him, just say you really like the show too.  Someone that types "loooove" sounds so young and ditzy.    I would just keep it casual.  I think however you approach it is how it will turn out.  If you are feeling awkward, it will be awkward, but if you are just feeling casual and fun, the conversation should be that way too.    Don't overthink it, just do it.  He wouldn't be on Facebook if he didn't want to be social.|`|V5Mw6rUtaa	So if this boy was more than a freshman I would give you advice, but I have a problem.

CL18wBxjaa	first you should confront him about it, tell him whatever you need to say. get it all out. Tell him he's being hypocritical. and if he doesn't change, you should leave him. those reasons aren't good ones. a. you are stronger than you think. and b. you're not going to care any less about him as time goes on.|`|8o46SYApaa	well if it was up to me i will break up with him and i will cuz before something bad really happens like he could hit cuz of his problems and it could get worse....|`|cSOpcKOWaa	Tell him how you feel, and don't be mean about it. Don't cry either it won't work. Just sit him down and matter of factly say, excuse me, "name" I think we need to talk. I know you have a lot going on at the moment and you may be a little stressed out, but I am here to help you cope with it. All that I ask is that you be a little more sensitive towards my feelings and we can get through whatever it is that you are dealing with.Tell him,  I love you very much, and by all means I am not going anywhere so lets get through this together.|`|X1TeqHcxaa	Yes, leave him.  Ever think he could be bipolar?  If that's the case, run out of there and don't look back.|`|VBTy9poNaa	If your boyfriend is abusive, the only thing to do is leave. The relationship isn't right for you and he won't change. Eventually you need to be strong and the sooner the better so you can be happy and find someone who is right for you.

xj5KnGwEaa	As a guy, I don't have a particular preference for height. I guess it's considered "normal" for the girl to be shorter, since males are taller on average than females. Then again, I'm also 5'11", so there's very few girls taller than me.|`|n1Rhv4s0aa	im not a guy haha but guys normally like girls a bit shorter then them, definitely not like wayy taller.

Looking at your major I can tell you from personal experience that you can not go wrong with hospitality as there are a lot of jobs in that field all over the world.  Many of my friends have jobs on cruise ships so that they can do just what you were talking about (traveling around the world).  I know your question was about whether you are datable or not, but I don't know you well enough to answer that.  Just know this, you are an amazing person with a lot to offer to this world.  Please don't let people who criticize you get you down.  They are only holding you back from reaching your full potential.  I wish you the best of luck as you continue on and trust me when you least expect it that person that you are looking for will find you.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Yeah I'm 18 you sound like the regular college type. Of course your pretty too a bonus.|`|qpmGLd7laa	Nope.  Here's why:  -You're majoring in useless crap.  -You smoke.  -You're asking...  -You like tattoos.  -You're not ugly, but not my type.|`|sCGWcJTFaa	no you are older than me. but you have a good personality.:) Although I don't like people with tattoos much.|`|q2POh1dEaa	No.      But you seem like a really cool girl|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	yeah, but you should get glasses that frame your face better.|`|AA10450002	MY EYES!

0da6ab3c6b462dc6d34ee0177bdc0459aa	I am a guy but for sure its  turn off for girls.  Now the girl has many ideas and doubts in her mind thinking about u?  Why would you have a BB gun? mostly in a dorm room.  What can happen where all students are living next to each other.  Self-defense? not really dude it might penetrate in skin but if a person is after you and want to kill you the BB gun ain't going to stop him.  Pepper spray will have more effect.|`|hH1eNmUyaa	id be afraid you were an assassinator.|`|AA10349362	i dont know. if she asks about it, then assure her its just  a BB gun.  :)  she shouldnt be freaked out by a gun that shoots out  circular silver pellets lol :)|`|zg6sgA3faa	Tell them before hand about it so they will not be surprised about it later. Honesty is the best policy in today's society|`|ktq7lF81aa	Try to keep it away from her until you are closer.
7e4jxj3Daa	I don't think so. That is too weird.|`|wUbvU3aiaa	Haha!

3fu3V8O8aa	Greetings to Young Lady Whose Name I Cannot Make Sense Of! My name Josef, a Hindu Muslim.    How Josef suppoosed to know these answers?  If he go to your school, he likely talk to you again.  If he date you 6 weeks, he think of you probably.  If you live in same town, you likely see him again.  But he not think of you way that you want him to think of you, because he broke up.    If you let him see you naked, that likely why he break up with you because he not respect you.  Sorry!    Now Young Lady, please have caution. What you do as young lady is important decison. Many critical junctions affect rest of you life and need good decisions.     Bad early decisons when young create problems later in life, because entire direction of life change for worse.    "Good Advice From Josef": Do not let any man see you naked until wedding night. Letting him take your body before wedding night is guarenteed way to lose your man, because he not respect you after that. Not going naked save you lot of heart hurt, and you get good man who care about you... not selfish creep pig. You weed out pigs that way!!! Nice guy will wait and respect you.    Kiss OK, naked not OK. Everything else work out OK!    Someday, a Lucky Guy ask you to marry him. This not Lucky Guy.  You don't know what future hold, so keep you pants on until wedding night.    You be less confused if you follow "Good Advice From Josef".     Thank you - Come again.
jf1oPsSeaa	probably just dating.  some girls and guys say that they're married because they really like the people theyre dating.   also, some of them just say that because they're joking around or just put it for no reason. i dont think its anything to worry about|`|VGJ8YpaIaa	Why would she say married if she wasn't?  Yes, she is married.  There ARE people out there who don't tak their spouse's last name upon getting married.  And anyway, if she was ONLY dating, she's still taken.  So that means she's off limits.|`|A4U5folvaa	Many many many people put married to either not be bothered or they just put it to put it, literally, it doesn't mean she is married.. This is social networking half of whats on the pages is false or misleading lol. Only way to find out is to ask or learn about it some other way.    PS: Try to find a girl you like man.. Not some girl you saw online, and you like the way she looks. Unless you know her.. She better be stunning!|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Facebook stalking is so skeezy. Perhaps you should get to know her and then you'll be able to find out by asking her instead of stalking her.
fJ7E43kWaa	If you feel that you really have changed, try to communicate this to your ex-friend. What's the worst that can come of trying?
vl6OtBfWaa	Naw thats normal I am not gay but sometimes can see two hot ripped guys and think its hot.  Its just because human sexuality is very arousing to humans in general.  There is nothing wrong with any feelings that dont harm the other person.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	you need to explore your feelings more this could just be nothing or maybe your gay|`|jMffH1kzaa	I'm sry to say but i think you are lesbian, but theres nothing wrong with it!|`|JERUmEFzaa	It`s only a little bit weird...|`|OWw3LWDCaa	nothing is wrong with you, it is quite normal to feel this way, doesnt mean your lesbian.|`|M2JNgbI1aa	well nothin is wrong with you.I think girls look pretty  but its normal for a girl to say that|`|JaXIaOn1aa	No it's fine, why? do people call you "alternative"?|`|igBds5Lhaa	you probably are bi.   your young explore and try new things before you get old and people don't see you as young and innocent and attractive anymore.  i think everyone feels the same about 2 women messing around or at least most people think like that.|`|WPGigNjHaa	I think that is perfectly normal.  I struggled with that question when I was younger and came to find out that I wasn't alone.  I've talked to friends of mine, in honest, open settings who've also confessed to finding other girls attractive.  I think you'd be surprised how common this is, people just don't normally talk about it or admit it.  I am now in a very loving relationship with a guy and don't feel confused at all.|`|pYcEvMpZaa	I think alot of girls would want to try stuff with other girls but not necessarily want to be gay.|`|U6UUQJe4aa	Omq I had the same problem lol.  But no theres nothinq wronq with dat.  But im lesbian... & idc wat anybody else thinks.  But jus because my outcome became me becoming lesbian doesnt mean its the same for you......   You probablyy jus think girls are pretty or certain things look nice on them ... well w.e you think bout girs is okay .  You would kno your Les. if you actually get sexually active with one.    okay lol    Good luck tho ....  & remeber dnt be afraid 2 show your true colors   if your Les or Les.   yu shuldnt care wat anybody else thinks|`|R0GquKH1aa	nothings wrong with you i think girls are pretty too DONT WORRY
xthjbUg2aa	yea im a guy i like this one the best it isnt to stright forward but it also adds a little more mystriy     really passionately hugged u, and kissed your neck when u hevent spoken in a really long time....|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Sure. Shows that they really love you|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Depends am I attracted to her? Cause it could get EXTREMELY awkward. If I liked her yeah I guess.|`|1YZYqMcnaa	no. sounds too cheesy.|`|qif1TQtnaa	if i like her|`|uFJXz1x3aa	noooo thats too sudden, id honestly freak out cuz idk whats going on|`|MfUMaKcDaa	aw that's cute. i've been wanting to do that do this certain guy for a while now....|`|8Xud3vi8aa	c the problem w/ that is if the guy isnt as in2 u then it would b really awkward...|`|AA10046969	maybe|`|59RrQSqLaa	that'd be sweet|`|4vDVvCK2aa	that's hasn't rely happened to my but the person i liked surprised me and was my firs kiss when i did not know she liked me at all until that day.|`|QZgzePebaa	yea if i liked her|`|tHD3xMt7aa	it would be my dream i would love it that is so freakin great go for it|`|dc7647c7cee3902f066b5c7d2dc35ddeaa	Guys like that a lot. Especially if you do it in front of all their buddies.     A female friend I liked did that to me on my birthday. She came out of nowhere, gave me a big hug and said "Happy Birthday Stallion". Then she kissed me right on the lips in front of all my buddies. All my friends were like WTF? I was speechless for 5 minutes.    I never forgot that birthday. It was also better than any birthday present I've ever received. The look on the faces of my friends were priceless.|`|x3a1T66naa	depends of if he likes you.
UKP3DWokaa	yeah. i think it would work. guys have a tendency of liking girls that arent weird and akward around them. so be yourself and like maybe see if he wants to chill. for all you know you guys might have a ton in common and really hit it off. but from experience....waiting does nothing. so go for it! :)|`|RV7KrjVmaa	Smile and say hi, quietly. Leave it to him to say hi back, and if he doesnt, then at least no one else heard you lol. But just expect that things could go either way. There will be others : )
v0qm71o1aa	Yes.  You must trya little bit harder how to avoid him.  Change your number for a start.|`|a3f885953107aeba33459bd9269d3a98aa	why are you trying to forget him in the first place if you are almost bestfriends? why don't you talk to him and tell him.. if he wants to go further then good if he is not ready then good riddance.
6rxOjhk4aa	talk to him, let him know how you feel. dicuss ways you 2 could make it work. don't pressure him to letting you move back in with him, if he wants a little bit of time, let him have it. then try again, let him know though, but don't let him take over the conversation, speak what you feel
JpmKtpqmaa	he is prob just jealous that you moved on..ignore him, let him think about what he lost...|`|dTdLrjFNaa	I think he wants to get back with you.|`|Y0mRcFqZaa	CUZ HE'S JEALOUS....JUST LAUGH WHEN U SEE HIM|`|h2bGyi8Uaa	he's jealous and angry with you and probably still likes you.|`|40qTdKuPaa	Your ex is just jealous and wants to get on your nerves and get your attention. Just ignore him, your boyfriend might think you actually care what hes doing. If he continues, you should tell him to stop because hes being annoying. Hope this helps.|`|jEA6z3jlaa	get a knife and shank his ***|`|nE5GfCumaa	Your boyfriend needs to address the issue. Or you should ask him your ex- what is the problem?|`|NEjMcnEnaa	He's envy|`|RpcyfAjLaa	he still wants you, just dont worry about him he will move on.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	1st step   try to talk to  him and tell him to stop, nicely.     Step 2 (if that doesnt work)  Then, this is great about highschool. Make a scene of it infront of your boyfriend (make sure hes one of those boyfriends that will say something to him if he steps out of line or if hes not one of those types  it doesnt matter if the new boyfriend is around or not), his friends (you want to embrass him) and 3 around some of your friends (so its  say to them hes annoying and dont be his friend, hes a jerk and i dont like him). Just say something loud like( If i was a girl, which im not, and im not in highschool, this would be easy), "why dont you just get away from me" "im sorry, i have a boyfriend, i dont need two at one time" "i thought we were done dating" "didnt you get that memo" "or should i leave you a facebooked you a comment?" Boys at that age or shy.     1 make sure hes actually around you and he doesnt have to be there. like this isnt a small class and he cant help but being close to you or his locker is right next to yours. Just cause you break up with him, its not like he can go and say "can i move my locker, i dont have the same girlfriend anymore"     2. Once you do this, it cant be undone, so if hes your friend. Then just try the first step.|`|cGTJVzCVaa	maybe hes jealous?  or still has feelings for you?  hmm, try talking to him about it.  maybe that would help. x|`|FohxhKBzaa	Why the hell do you think,he still likes you..|`|LLLHZuDnaa	yup those are prolly true... he prolly is jealous/still likes you. I'm a guy.. in HS i found myself looking at my ex after we broke up and being jealous that she found another guy.|`|ALvp7YRuaa	maybe because he still has feelings for you. but just sit down with him and have a good talk. if he dont understand then that means he really loves you.|`|QmpobMj7aa	They're obviously trying to piss your boyfriend off.|`|sfJp4QNJaa	He is being a no0b. Just ignore him. ;)|`|KaAXJJo8aa	awwww... sounds like he is jealous and is having his friends join in on his pity parade. awww... just ignore him :-P
NN4iEOeEaa	text him call him u know u want him|`|LWwGW48Daa	Thats what is so lame about relationships your age..they are public property|`|4NI6QDDuaa	talk to him more, and if you have classes together sit by him (if you can). you should also, if your mom/dad let(s) you go out, then you should go hang out at the mall, or go see a movie every once in a while. but if they don't, find an after school activity you both have interest in. or you could have him over to study, and then just talk the whole time. if you can't do any of that, then you could stay after in a class together that you need help in or you could tutor him/ him tutor you. you could try to make it a point to sit together at lunch. if absolutely none of this works then, maybe you should call it off, at least for a little while. until you have a little more time to actually have a relationship. i know how busy life is when you're 13/14. i personally could never have a bf at this point...too much homework, and extra curricular activities, especially since i have honers, i'm just too busy.(plus my parents are oober strict to the tenth power)|`|RSFRTYn9aa	talk to him more. my friend dated a guy and never talked to him their relationship doesn't exist anymore
xb1x51Koaa	This is common for marriage, in fact I am going through the same thing. But my problem is my mother in law. She never wanted her son to be married... to anyone. My point is, try to find out if there is something else going on. Otherwise trust, if you have not changed than the problem is not you. Good luck. Hopefully neither one of us will need a divorce.|`|IvMPh09baa	Keep attending the counseling sessions, or maybe if he's annoyed with the counselor then get a new one.  Sounds like he is not opening up to you or the counselor and you need to get through to him and find out what is going on.  Make sure he knows he can trust you and you want to talk to him... just be his friend.  It's probably a phase... your married and its really sinking in or your just moving past he honeymoon phase... meaning you are partners and there is really no need for all the extra emotional mushy stuff... all that is great around the wedding time but get real here... he's just comfortable with you and sounds like he's a simple guy.  Keep trynig to talk to him!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Whose idea is the counseling?  If it is yours, stop making him go and just go yourself.  Your expectations from marriage (and him) are driving him up a wall.  Back off and watch him for awhile to see a pattern, because you haven't provided enough information for us to know what is going on and you've already said you don't know what is going on.    He has clearly distanced himself from you, by absorbing in his work and with his friends (and sleeping on the sofa).  Many women like verbal communication and many men don't so much love it, especially if it feels like a demand on them.  Give him space so he'll pursue you freely.    Get busy with a hobby or pursuit you enjoy.  Get some friends to spend time with.  Have a life that doesn't revolve around him.  Be interesting.    Many men today have very negative views of marriage--it's all around us, on television, in the gym, with their single male friends.  I am not saying ignore the problem.  I'm saying if he is unwilling or cold about talking about it, don't try to drag it out of him.  And look to his parents' marriage for insight into his expectations.|`|an1EMiFkaa	Welcome to marriage hell...typical and all too common|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Maybe you should change counselors if he is so unhappy. Do not forget yourself. Keep seeing your friends and family and doing things to make yourself happy. Marriage is no bed of roses. Welcome to the club|`|7cjqT33Baa	Did he have a bachelor party?  Maybe something happened there that he is feeling really guilty about?  It has to be guilt and something he doesn't want to admit, otherwise he'd just talk to you about it.|`|nE5GfCumaa	Something is going on in his head. You should sit down and speak to him about this. You are correct never get a divorce unless you really must. Then again NEVER let a MAN hit you! Now back to the answer. Go back and think what it is that might have changed? If you can not think of anything, just tell him it is time you talk!|`|fHHeal1Vaa	i am not that stupid not to know how much I hate you and how sick you are. I would rather pay for love than be with you, worship satan than follow you, so back to the begining, without your "skills" in therapy you wold never have a single look from me let alone anything else. Love was somebody elses you mistakenly took it being for you poor man
6rxOjhk4aa	sit down and talk to him, ask him directly if he likes you. if he says no, but looks uneasy, he lying,    or maybe he is waiting for you to ask him out, if the talking doesn't work, ask him out.
HCWkdk4naa	yes, it's normal.  when you have an unrequited crush it turns sour.  you are finally seeing what you were blind to before, and you are realizing that he doesn't like you much either.  later the hate will turn into complete indifference.    give your attentions to a man you deserves them, somebody who is crazy about you, or someone who will ask you out.
PxVDtnSzaa	Some women are afraid of commitment. Just like guys. To fill a void, some girls just have flings with random guys because it makes them feel better about themselves. It is a personal choice, and no one, unfortunately can change that.
52af13bcbc5e95d029559597bfff0444aa	IM her and maybe you guys can have fantasies together|`|479ceb78fd2bc5c228c35bd7e3bcdc6eaa	ALLLL boys think like that......when the hormones are in overdrive. <br>  <br>  I bet all your pimples contain pure Testosterone....<br>  <br>  After that reality sinks in....but it is still fun....|`|9ec2ac2c5b0c5dc02d8bbc8b5a1c9ab6aa	good luck!!!|`|d8ea9cff0bdf8ecf0e5cdb89575dd33faa	don't do anything!|`|e224701b3c1afd73dbcf37cc31b141efaa	You are a sweetheart.

aGOBuJtKaa	1)Brand of condom is something you will figure out on your own. Everyone likes something different, and it also depends on the size of your penis.  (Trojans are a very popular brand)    2) You should explain to her that you know that it may hurt, and anytime she needs you to stop, or ease up to let you know.     3) You should use a new condom each time you have sex. (Although not many men can keep going after orgasm...some need a break)    4) You don't really have to pull out when wearing a condom, but after being finished, pull yourself out by grabbing the base    5) Condoms can break, so her being on birth control may be helpful, however some women have bad side effects from different birth control methods, that it might not be something she can do.    Always be a gentlemen, and NEVER under any circumstances do you have sex without a condom. I also believe before having sex with someone ( if they had previous partners) that they should be tested for STD's.|`|OWw3LWDCaa	you NEED protection whether its your first time or not, you sound really young. are you actually ready to make this commitment?  brand of condom does not matter. if you are under 16 please wait until your older when you understand more about sex and the emotions that go with it.|`|GoEdpprvaa	Always buy brand name condoms like Trojan. Tell your gf that she'll most likely bleed during her first time if she does not know this already. You should just worry about pleasuring your woman during sex. A lot of making out will help you to both achieve orgasim. When she has an orgasim that might send you into an orgasim. Don't worry about pulling out! Just be sure that the condom fits very snug, but not too tight & you shouldn't have a problem. If you think asking your gf to get on the pill is a weird question, then you don't sound ready to be having sex with her. Just ask her to do it, it will make it much more safe for you guys. Oh & she has to be on the pill for a while until it starts to work, just so you know.  Now go out there & make a wonderful, romantic memory :]|`|4Y2w3EeXaa	look if 2 pl have never had sex before, no need for protection. at your age, go bareback and just tell her to take a pill.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Condoms can fail, so she really ought to be using protection too.  It doesn't hurt everyone, it didn't hurt me.  You should withdraw immediately after ejaculation and yes, they can slip off.|`|3SuUQvsYaa	1- trojan *****! best ones  2- no, just bang her and tell her it was fun after. she should already know it hurts the first time  3-  bro once you blow your done, get out and clean up!  4-  nah, not really if its on all the way your good just dont pull out fast  5- condom is all you need bro      dont question yourself and dont get all nerdy on her telling her **** and asking questions. let it happen and it will be great    get some!    i got all the answers on this **** hit me up, ill help yo out|`|VOc3DmkSaa	1) If your old enough to have sex your old enough to ask the person behind the counter. Though the packaging should give some helpful hints.    2) Don't bother, it'll just worry her and she may know already, if it's pleasurable enough and she's relaxed enough then it shouldn;t hurt to much. (ie - make sure shes well lubricated, easiest way is a bit of foreplay, dont just rush into it)    3) Should be but be careful that you don't split it. Make sure she's on the pill just incase.    4) If it fits right it shouldnt fall off. Get the right size (use packaging instructions)    5) Insist on pill. Your young, you dont want kids. You need as much security as possible. Also wait for her to be on the pill for a while for it to be effective (doctor will tell her details)    Hmm, reminders? Don't rush it. Wait for the appropriate time and always make sure you have protection.    Oh and for a first time try to be as relaxed as possible because if your both tense it wont be a pleasurable experience.|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	look mate sex is something you should both enjoy  learning about what you both like is most of the fun when you first have sex the more she is turned on the less it will hurt so make sure you really get her going by using your fingers and lots of oral sex, trust me she will love you for it.  once you have come in a condom i don't think its a good plan to carry on making love with the same condom, your love wand will go soft and the condom could then leak so its best to pull out bin the condom then once you get hard again use a fresh one.  how can we tell you what type to get why don't you try different ones when your having a w@nk.  its always best to use both a condom and birth control just to be safe|`|A2fFZFk6aa	Buy Durex, theyre the best, or get free one's from a walk in centre. As for pain, she'll no the deal with your first time, if she dosnt she's too young! if your worried about hurting her just don't be to rough! Your are meant to pull out still with the condom on!, if you did'nt this would kind of defeat the object of the condom! and yes holding the base should prevent it from sliping off If the girl is under 18 she might fins it quite difficult to get the pill and it is actuley quite a big thing for a girl to start taking, it's not just 'taking the pill' you have to find the right one that can take months, some have terrible side effects like depression, weight gain mood swings etc, it's not weird to talk to her about it but it would be weird to 'insist'. Just use a condom but make sure you use it properly! Practise putting them on by your self so you don't get all flustered trying to work it out! make sure you get the right size to avoid it slipping off or feeling to tight or tearing!...don't boter with the pill yet, wait until your in a very stable relationship with her and sexually active more than just occasionally to start with that......of course it may turn out she's already on the pill!!!|`|10e768f86234dcf1dc5a7fe31019497baa	Bob is a bad man don't listen! always wear a condom! Don't worry if you're both over 16 just take your time and be nice.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	1. the best you can afford    2. your girl should already know what to expect,and don't worry about what happens, as you'll both be nervous,so don't expect too much the firdst time    3. you'll probably not want to    4.Yes    5. that is your choice and your girls|`|s6RPiUE8aa	1) chemist, try out different sizes  2) just stay calm, youll be fine  3) not really  4) you should be okay, pull out  5) no, that should be fine as it is
dItZAwI2aa	i wouldn't.    my 2nd wife had only slept with 1 other person before we married. throughout the marriage she felt that because of her only having slept with 1 other person that she had "missed out" on something so she went out and started "making up for lost time"...    she is now an ex wife and has now slept with more than 2 guys in her life...but seems happier each and everytime she does it.

It could've meant, are you kidding, YA RIGHT! Or you know I do or something like that and the he's too old to be chasing skirts, take the hint! That means he just thought you were hot and has to move on to somethin serious, I could be wrong tho... PSCHSH YA RIGHT!
Z9l7fhCiaa	Yes, it totally means something. He's probably really into you. Whenever me and my ex-boyfriend would cuddle, his heart would always be beating really fast, and he was sooooo warm, kinda like a heater. He would always blame it on a cold but it was like that for months. Haha. And whenever he would goof around and hug me, his heart wasnt beating fast, and he wasn't warm either. Hope it helps.|`|8pMsWOXFaa	yes i mean he likes u...but b careful if he flirts around a lot..|`|trpvcTBiaa	I think he might like you but try to see if he flirts differently with you than other girls. You should be careful since he's a flirt.|`|a42c0cbe296fc23ce84147b6dbb01a72aa	I think this means he is feeling very good.|`|Z7TloxtOaa	IF YOU GET THE FEELING HE LIKES YOU, HE MOST LIKELY DOES!!!!!|`|GckVXU4Paa	He hugs u and gets panic when he shakes hands or even hugs. Sounds interesting. He definitely loves u. Only, he is afraid of expressing himself.  Why don't u ask him out about his feelings regarding u..?  Will help u indeed to know whether he is really seeking u or not...|`|bUmdkEnxaa	First you list out your lovers good hobbies, bad hobbies ,good characters ,bad characters. Similarly ,write down your good hobbies, bad characters etc. Find out the common things and the differences. Then only ,you should judge, other wise you may have to suffer as a result of your judgment . First you have to match the good qualities between you two.  You can write e mails to me|`|hLozB0MUaa	you get to hug him & ur not even going out?!?!?! wow... lucky... idk if he likes u, it'd help if you added more detail... but it is possible|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Nervousness.|`|KT0UTX8taa	I think it's a good sign! And I think you two will end up together. Good luck!|`|Pl9lY7qCaa	Not only likes but may be loving you & that's why there is nervousness. About flirting, he may be doing so as to get your attention & may want to know your reaction.|`|28f4776354fb5bae4e4c97b010aa3511aa	go wid de flow if u also lyk him....|`|7mq8eYJgaa	Yeah he loves u ....... so what?? r u gona have sex with him???|`|Mp2r9Ul5aa	His heart beating really fast and his hands shaking is not a sign i would count on...it is different for every person. I would definitely check out other signs, like the flirting.
MoZPkFOeaa	Confront them. I have learned that by holding everything in it only hurts more. You have to let people know how you feel or its never going to change. They probably dont think you are bothered by it. Just mess around and be like "hmm i think you should put me on your top :]] tehehe. jkjk. [[p.s your on mine]]" thats a smooth way of doing it, and if they decide to be bitches and say they dont want to, then you have in there that you were just kidding. so it all works out good. but i stress the idea " confront your problems"|`|9hSSocD0aa	Well its not that big of a deal. its just myspace.  if it reali means that much to you then just ask  them to put you on there top 10. if they say no  then take them off. get some new friends. but  reali dont think its that big of deal.  -XD|`|j3rY3Qdpaa	well you could try asking them if your their best friend. or just do the same that they did to you|`|oGv4wJgtaa	Your making it sound like Myspace is your life like if you didnt recieve a letter that everyone else recieve ud be upset bout it... its going to sound harsh but get over it. its happened to me and you cant force them to make you their top friend.|`|QH3qi1Daaa	They obviously don't like you.... just kidding, don't judge them because of myspace. They probably forgot to add you or don't get on myspace that much. You shouldn't stop being friends just because of myspace since theres more things to life than a website.|`|zTnk59gGaa	It's just Myspace... there are bigger issues to worry about in life.|`|qs5JFedvaa	Well Give Me More Details About Your Friends
7ef54de89410c20c50a741d45f955f77aa	he was probably some insecure loser who had to make it seem like the rejeciton didn't phase him so he laughed.don't worry about not dating yet.enjoy your friends because boys and relationship opportunities will never fail to exist in the future|`|xXyy51Efaa	That guy is a pathetic loser! K? You are only 12. And tell that imature little boy that being an immature loser is something to laugh at! I'm 14 and never dated. i'v met people that were in college and never dated! So there! :) Hope I cheered you up! Oh and those 12 year olds who think that they know how to kiss? Really don't! They have no clue and just poke each others eyes out!!! Losers. Not you though.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Your only 12 what kind of relationship would it be anyway?|`|59RrQSqLaa	12 years.OMG I would laugh at you , if you were 24, but not 12... you're a kid|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	When your ready your heart and mind will tell you.|`|bSiKrblGaa	... Dude, you're twelve.    I've known people who were eighteen and had never gone out with anyone.    Worry about school for now. Education is key! (Believe it or not, most guys like the girl smart and responsible. If the guy doesn't, then he will most likely not be a good guy).|`|GAxHzgEEaa	well i don't know if i can cheer you up but  it's not bad that you havn't went out with some one yet  next time the boy says something just say  so. i bet you havn't went out with someone either  with that face i dont think it would be possible  or if he has just say  and i really dont care  you act like i have to have a boyfriend to be happy  just shut up and get out my bidnesssss you dumb trick  hahah thats what i always say|`|xl8VkMrfaa	Your twelve.

No one has ever asked me out.|`|H6Lc79EOaa	You said no, he should have felt bad, not you.  You are 12, you have tons of time.  Believe me, you'll regret every relationship you ever try to rush or force onto yourself.  You can't just date to have a date.  Wait for a guy you actually like.  Please!|`|40qTdKuPaa	Youre only 12, its okay not to date right now. He's just mad you said no. You are going to have so many more chances. Hope this helps.|`|pLqGakDVaa	Don't worry about it- you're 12. You will have plenty of time for boyfriends in the future so don't worry about it now. Enjoy the time you have whilst you're young. I know everyone says that your youth goes by too fast- but it's true!!! Don't feel bad about this boy laughing- he's just embarrassed that you turned him down- but he will get over it. Enjoy your youth. :)|`|EFiOj5Bpaa	Girl if your hot i'd date you , jks....Just don't worry he is laughing because he doesn't wanna seem stupid or pathetic, im 13! :)he was embarressed, TRUST|`|cGTJVzCVaa	im nearly 13 and i never went out with a boy, i think you should wait until it 'feels right' you know? until you know that you actually love that boy :-) hope this helps. +the laughing? maybe it was a joke just to embaress you? i don't know, but boys at my school do it all the time. x|`|f3gedd55aa	I'm 17 & never had a girlfriend, you'll be fine. Just remember, if all your friends are dating right now, then that just means that you can learn from their mistakes or other experiences when it comes time that you're ready to have a boyfriend.|`|hnTDf3wNaa	your 12. don't feel bad its normal my sister is 12 too & shes never gone out with anybody & i know a 18 year old boy that's never went out with a girl. so its normal i think its pretty cool that your waiting. don't feel offended either by that boy at that age the boys are immature any ways.|`|HvLAoHP1aa	i'm fifteen and i haven't gone out with anyone i am pretty too... one of my best friends is also pretty and hasn't dated and she just turned eighteen
yLmeZMTWaa	Ignore the insults from other people. You are obviously in a real mess. First, you have to think positive. Don't wallow, your friends and family are missing out if they don't want to know you anymore. Join a new group to make new friends, that will build your confidence. You may also meet a new man, maybe one who actually will treat you properly this time. If the new group you join is an evening class you could get qualifications to help you get a job. Maybe you could go on holiday first to have a bit of me-time, just try and feel good about yourself and try to forget the people who have treated you badly. Good luck!|`|YQSk0PxTaa	yeah, go on holiday, leave for a bit. go and find your inner peace. do it for you. you only know whats best for you.|`|rIzx4OEWaa	Take some positive action an join the armed services like the RAF or the Navy or Army, get back your self respect an learn a job that will always stand you in good stead. It will also teach you how to cope with Independence, you may not have to live with your family but the services will give you somewhere to belong an everyone is in the same boat. Give it a try you will become the person you always wanted to be.  You can do it an need never feel alone again. I wish you well.|`|AYVQhXVjaa	I stopped reading after the first paragraph.    I know you are some psycho who writes crap about darkness and evil. You make me sick.|`|ZMbxvF5Faa	go smoke a fat J and kick back and relax
7q9MN1Wkaa	I've NEVER hit a guy in the testicles out of anger or on purpose. I know how vulnerable and sensitive they are!    I HAVE squashed my boyfriend's balls into the bed with my knee by accident before. We were play-wrestling & I got on top of him. We were naked and he has quite large, low-hanging ones. I guess it was a matter of time before it happened!    He was curled-up, holding his nuts for a long time. I felt SO bad! I had to make it up to him BIG time!    But the worst injury I've witnessed was when I was mountain biking with brother. He slipped off his seat somehow & whacked his privates on the bar.    He was curled up on the ground for about 20 minutes, throwing up & choking. I thought he was going to die!    We found out later that he split one of his testicles! YEEOOWCH!!!!! I am SO glad I'm a female & will never have to feel that kind of pain! I've hit my own crotch on the bar before, but never had that kind of reaction or injury (just a good bruise between the legs!).    He had to have surgery, but everything turned out OK.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Threaten to harm me or another person|`|K4SSZ6qFaa	be a complete ***. attack her|`|YOYcIQ4Daa	be a cheater/playa|`|ItvJVKh2aa	Give her $20, and go around a corner so there are no witnesses.
0KRD4LSEaa	Her children, and her worries over things, are her 'drug of choice' and she IS sucking you down with her...you can try to make her aware that she is living in an impulsive and negative way, and perhaps guide her on ways to step back and not do so, but if she denies culpability or decides that you are incorrect in your assessment, you might need to tell her straight out that she is draining you, and that if it continues you'll have no place in your life for her drama.  Lifebuoys only work if the drowning person grabs and holds on to them...if she throws it back to you, there's not much point in tossing out another, now, is there?  And especially when she doesn't even realize that she's in trouble.|`|5lerwrFbaa	I would just be honest with her and let her know how she effects you. If anything your her friend and maybe she just needs to hear it like it is from a true friend.|`|InaMS7gWaa	Chill out and get a free Laptop at <a href="http://gifts.freepay.com/?r=36454340" rel="nofollow">http://gifts.freepay.com/?r=36454340</a><br>  <br>  Its the Best|`|ZfYGRkLQaa	have you discussed this with your friend? maybe she doesnt realize that shes affecting you so much.
5vYyIflCaa	2 Tim 3:2 -- For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; ... 13  But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.    A sign of the times... perilous.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Same reason there are so many faithless women. Because it is popular and expected for people to be amoral these days.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Because it's easy to be that way. Not enough commitment. It's not just the men either. Lots of women are unfaithful as well.|`|P7L4Vd3Paa	My belief is that we are in a generation where unfortunately many men were raised in single parent homes, generally by just a mother or grandparent.  If a man does not have a positive, faithful male role model growing up, then how can he possibly know right from wrong when it comes to relationships?    Just my opinion - I'm sure though that there are many exceptions of fine young men who were raised by just their mother who don't cheat on their wives.|`|xU8ovpD8aa	Because our society is falling away from its Judeo-Christian values, which emphasize faithfulness.  Bad influences on T.V. and poor moral instruction from most parents doesn't help.  If you want a guy that is going to be faithful look for Christian guys, and ones that walk their faith not just say they are a Christian.|`|u0HZkGL6aa	Because there are so many woman in this world whom want what you have to assure themselves they are as good as you.  As pretty.  Their so stupid because if a man strays from a woman for another, it's not because they are prettier or smarter it's because men are horn toads?!  Forgive?  Yes.  Forget.  Definitely.  Both and move on.  If you don't forgive the pain will live inside you for way too long.  Forgive with a smile and Forget it like a bad habit?!

ww9Wx0mwaa	Y not.,.,even u can love from England to Indonesia,. all u lovers need is to be strong in love.    the top 5 issue u have to follow is,.    1.make sure u both see well in pictures and web can at least weekly once or monthly once with new appearance and new pictures,.like u both should know well how u r partner look like,.    2.make sure u have u r partners complete contact details including home telephone to office address,.    3.make sure u r partner is really in love with u before u travel to meet him or her in a real date,.    4.make sure u r family status is equal or u r family has no issue on u to marry him or her,.    5.make sure u have enough finance to keep u r partner happy.even u need more and more money to make her happy because her motherland is away and needs more money to travel frequent,.so be clear if u can afford it u can love even a girl from moon,.or boy from mars,.|`|TGNf348oaa	no it can't survive unless ur really really really in love with her.|`|yIHlvPFfaa	No, I was in one and it crashed and burned for me.  Tried it multiple times, I really don't think it's worth it anymore.  You have to be super committed like you have to go up and she has to come down, vice versa, and have to be in unconditional love.  I don't think it works, sorry.|`|VZPtCkweaa	if the two people really love eachother, yes, i think it can work|`|QreA4abxaa	what makes long distance hard on people is the physical part, if your not worried about that then no!!|`|l4WEwTWwaa	I'll put it simply in two lines because it is simple. If it survives, you were actually in love, if it doesn't, you were not in love.|`|GwEZ8uJnaa	i have never been in that situation... and not to burst any bubbles, but you hear of it failing more so than lasting.  If you are really dedicated to making it work, then try and go for it.  if you care a lot, then it is at least worth giving a shot.|`|axPkzJnjaa	No, it wont work.. at all..|`|TcuRYwiwaa	Yes, trust is the keyword.|`|bbLw3wkbaa	No, it's almost why cyber love doesn't work out.|`|9hSSocD0aa	it just depends on how much you  love that person.if you truely love  them then you can handle it. if not  then you just another one of those   guys [[no offence]]  -XD|`|LMflh3C4aa	It depends on the person.  It takes a lot of trust, and you have to go out of your way a lot.  I used to go to a college 2 1/2 hours away from my boyfriend.  Every weekend, I would drive the 2 1/2 hours one-way to see him.  We'd talk every day on the phone.  Eventually, I moved closer and now I only live a 1/2 hour away from him.  Long distance relationships are doable, but you have to really love and trust the person.|`|59xQlCjGaa	Yes and no.      If you think that you two really love each other, and you would do anything for them and vise verse (kind of like Edward and Bella!), everything will work out hopefully...    But if you don't think it will work out, and don't really know what to do, talk to your lover about your relationship, or talk to a very good friend.        I hope I helped!|`|LUNx8Llzaa	If it's meant to be..it will work. "Whatever will be, will be!"|`|769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	YES it absolutely can work!!!    Being in a long distance relationship isn't easy. It requires very strong trust, commitment, guidelines, and communication. Studies show that a majority of people involved in long distance relationships eventually break up. That's why you see so many "experts" proclaiming that long distance relationships are a bad idea and don't work. Yet if you learn to master communication and set the parameters of your relationship, it can work. It's an uphill battle, but it is possible, and many people do eventually become happily married as a result of being in a long distance relationship.   I am one of those people.      I met my husband in a hotel in Florida. I was living in Texas and he was visiting from Tennessee.  We kept our long distance relationship going for 4 years before one of us moved.  We got married in 2008.    I'm not saying it was easy (or inexpensive) but we both made a commitment to make it work and did.  For us, the trick was talking daily and seeing each other as often as possible.  Sometimes, we'd see each other twice in a month.  Other times, we'd go months without seeing each other at all.  Those were the really hard times.  It also wasnt easy seeing my friends with dates or having to go to parties alone.  Many of my friends didnt understand why we didnt want to double date or come over when my boyfriend was in town.  The truth is, we didnt want to spend our precious time with others because it always flew by so quickly.  When we did finally live in the same city, we hadnt done a lot with friends as couples and they were used to me not participating  in short, my friends had kinda moved on.        There were times when one of us wanted to end it because we needed the other one there.  It's terribly hard to go months without so much as a hug, or being able to reach out and hold your loved ones hand.  Long distance relationships are not easy in any way and thats why so many fail.  But     ANYTHING is possible and I wish you the best.|`|ZVqOvtf4aa	yes|`|lBSFD5xHaa	yes it can  if u truly love  each other  anything is possible.    :D|`|FCDLP2pGaa	it matters on the couple some people last and some people dont good luck|`|IFtKzGN0aa	i don't i mean what if the other person cheats on u and ur not there to see what the other person does|`|pxTsBlOMaa	if both people are truly committed to the relationship, yes.|`|4UQegWk0aa	It can. Me and my boyfriend were long distance for a long time and we have been together for 5 years.|`|mC2PXK4Faa	if the love is really there, it will never fade.  maybe this is a test of fate to see if you two reeeallly love each other.|`|FgWsUmdUaa	no way man forget that trust is going to be strained she could be doing other dudes and she could be thinking your doing other chicks|`|DxYwNFdhaa	Most dont but i think when the two people are meant to be and truely in love then their love will always survive any distance :-)|`|af4ib8kbaa	I do.  cuz well at first for my sister it didn't. they broke up. but then they saw each other again for about a week and spent every day toegher. they realized that they love each other and when they went back to school away from each other they still continued to talk to each other everyday. they do really love each other|`|AA10934463	worked for me for about a year then i moved in so i think if you make the  right desicions it will work . good luck|`|AW6YjU6paa	My brother swore he was going to marry his girlfriend even after he moved up to georgia but two monthes later they broke up and now 2 years later he is engaged with another girl|`|jta5L6h1aa	Love can survive many things.  My husband went overseas for ten months and we talked everyday, he came back and we got married.  It depends on the relationship and commitment.  Sometimes women are more faithful and focused than men.  How far away is he and what are your future plans?  Its a lot to be considered.  Is this someone you see yourself spending the rest of your life with and starting a family?  If you don't think you can do "this" because you are now attracted to someone else then break it off. If every time you call him he is not available, break it off.  Its bad enough that you two are apart, but if you are having problems keeping in touch because of outside entities then its not worth it.  many blessings|`|11SCey7Xaa	It can survive it you two really love each and are very committed for a long distance relationship. You remember that the key to survival in a long distance relationship is commutation. Texting, msn with webcam, mobile phone calls ( Video call?) so you see each other, writing letters. Talk atleast 3 - 4 times a week. If it is love then it will work out.  Good Luck!|`|kQA7SbY9aa	A relationship is what the two people involved make of it. If you *both*  want it to work, you will make it a priority to do everything they can to keep the love alive so that the it will survive, despite the distance. If just one of you has any doubt, the relationship is doomed to failure.     Some people are better at staying dedicated than others in your type of situation. If you don't think you can wait for the other person, be  honest with yourself, end it and move on with your life. You never want to put yourself in a situation where you agree to be in a long distance relationship but seeing someone else because she's not with you.|`|TuuxwOcHaa	no. sorry to be a pessimist|`|5wxEYFjkaa	if your love is strong enough..yeah:)  hang in there.:)|`|Gxz28zY1aa	I don't think so, but if you really really love this person then yes.  It can|`|MoZPkFOeaa	if its true. yes. but thats the good thing about long distance relationships... it tests your limits with that special person and you can find out if you are really built to last.|`|cdfec3396aea85b5ac123bfff9ea97a4aa	with plenty of phone sex it can|`|j3rY3Qdpaa	No becuase you meet other people as time goes by and eventually you'll have feelings for other people. but then again it depends how frequently you see each other.|`|AmBWXzv1aa	If they Really Love each other than yes.|`|zTKywK4Daa	No, but that doesn't have to stop you. =)  GOod luck with your decision.|`|Bi2L5AxZaa	you might not like my answer but its the truth you never know who is going to be over with her/him its based on trust and communication and id say unless u have a webcam i wouldnt do it, if i asked the question and i saw an answer like this i would die because you know its true|`|oFJ6SDpzaa	I think they can but its hard for them to survive. I'v been there and dont that man and its hard. I still love the girl today but the long distance just didn't work. You gotta trust each other 100% and you gotta believe its gonna work. Try to spend as much time together(Textin, talkin on the phone,E-mailing, IMing) But still live your life. Its a hard thing to do. I say love isnt measured by mile but the love between two people.|`|qfmTWB9Saa	Depends for how long?  Lasted for me, now we're engaged.  If they're into you they'll be faithful. If you're worried about them straying? Than you don't trust them enough to be in a close distance relationship.   I suggest you try. Outcomes are good alot of the time.     My fiancee went away to work in another city for the 3 months of the summer once. It was tough, but we visited 4 times I think, thats every 3 weeks, not too bad.   Work it out.

But then he'll know that your'll always be there for him. and if he doesnt say ok, and ask him what he wants to talk about. if he says i dont know or care, then choose a basic subject like movies or music.

As you grow older, both sides just get more chatty with more phone calls, well in my opinion.|`|pFykEqD1aa	guess its flirtin but id rather just go for the grope  if u notice ur bum or boobs being descreatly touched while ur being beaten then its deffo flirting|`|gUscgmroaa	i call it rough sex|`|EM5rQOGBaa	yea , my bf does with me lol as a bit of fun , but jus remember don't be as rough as u would be with a mate
qfmTWB9Saa	It's only wrong if you try to sabotage any relationship between either the two of them? or either of them and your children.  She'll say something one day that pisses you off.    And your boyfriend needs to grow up? You're going to see the father of your children sometimes, and you hanging out with his girlfriend has nothing to do with him, and it won't harm your and his relationship in any way.  I don't see how they are even connected.
5607cc2fb71a02b217bbfc94d124b2b9aa	Girl I know exactly how that is. I used to do that with my boyfriend and we were together for almost 4 years. But we ended up fallin out becuz we argued ALL the time. Although u mite love to argue, 9 times out of 10 he doesn't. Find another way to get his attention other than fighting. Get real cute for him or somethin...just don't argue. I don't want yall to end up breakin up over somethin small. I hope everything works out for u!
qAg0C7kKaa	dont worry i dont think its nething bad and u shouldnt want to b the same with other girls as u r with ur gf...shes special and should b held on a whole different level than the other girls ^_^ its ok to b shy around her its ok to get nervous thats to b expected cuz i do the same thing to im very confident with guys but when it cums down to the guy im dating i get tongue-tied so no worries ur not alone and its not a bad thing so u dont need to worry so much ^_^|`|rKbeXJPfaa	Oh i'm like the female version of you...!  I dont know why, maybe your just really shy, or afraid of commiting.   Maybe your just not ready for a relationship yet, which is totaly fine. theres nothing wrong with waiting longer. I'm sure you will know when you are ready to commit to someone. Good Luck anyway, and dont worry about it!
5kxwWtECaa	cause youre a wierdo trying to f up her relationship as hole
1keH3R6paa	Maybe he is interested in your person. Some guys are just a flirt; so don't get your hopes up too high. Guys are sometimes jerks. Strike that; they're almost all jerks. But if he's used to girls drooling on him, ignore him. Perfect. He will think you're a mystery, so he will be so curious and that is such a great feeling. Keep him guessing but when he actually has a conversation with him, flirt. Good luck.|`|jqKbyzQdaa	it is a possibility. the thing is though....is he a flirt or a show off in school??? if so, maybe its just his personality.|`|OZMyiH0Faa	it could be at my school all the boys try to show off in front of the girls they will jump over desk while the teacher isnt looking|`|h06mx3d8aa	maybe, trying paying some attention to him.|`|vkeuaEHiaa	It's a proven fact: the popular guys secretly want the shy girls. It happened to me way back when at a time when I was super shy. Things would have turned out great if the guy wasn't a complete jerk. So I'm thinking he likes you. Do you like him back? If so go for it.|`|ImENOklEaa	I'm pretty much in the same exact situation lol. I recently just found out that this popular guy thinks I'm hot. And I'm really quiet, just like you said you were. I was NOT expecting him, of all people to say I'm hot lol. I think this guy thinks your pretty cute lol, because this guy at my school does stare at me a lot and trys to show off haha. Good Luck, and yeah I'm pretty sure he thinks something of you.|`|3vdXBxoeaa	he likes you|`|asLXozfWaa	it's totally possible that he likes you. a lot of popular guys seem to go for the quieter girls who arent show offs, or at least i notice that from experience. if i were you, id let him know that you're acknowledging him. dont be afraid to make eye contact. (=|`|b0ddYFDWaa	hey u should first become friends and slowly u guys will be closser and closer...tell him how u feel about him..........u might not know if he likes u 2......!!!
l1iCPVPOaa	give that too him! :DD
7Iea5FcGaa	Well call him or email him and tell him how you truely feel about him. Find things in common with each other. Maybe dont get back together so soon. Just hang out for a while and see what happens. But just let him know you still like him.|`|toQ7m7JAaa	Pull down your pant and ask "do you like me, cuz i like you, will you be my boyfriend"|`|FB28L6D5aa	My fiance and I had that SAME problem, he'd always be upset because he is very passionate about music and video games.. And I SUCK at pop culture, I know nothing about it really... But I love gaming. And he always asks me references on music and movies etc, and I wouldn't get it and he would always say how we have nothing in common.. Anyways, if he broke up with you for it once then there's a chance he'll do it again.. So show him that you're willing to try out his "hobbies" so you two have something to do together. I tried looking into his favorite bands and listening to them etc, or researching movies he likes and then we'd talk about it. It made him happy..|`|jta5L6h1aa	You left out an important detail, your age group.  If you think that there is still something in your relationship that is worth holding on to, then go for it.  That way you will never have regrets that you didn't try.  Think about what attracted you two to each other in the first place.  Did you have a long conversation.  Were you in a place that you both like to frequent.  Those are things that you can still remind him about.  If it is just based on a sex thing then move on and learn from this relationship.  In the end, you always remember the beginning.  Just think about it.  Many blessings|`|DUOoMBqoaa	You can't convince him to do anything. Trying to do so will just make things weird. Give him his space, be yourself, don't get upset, and he will come around.|`|rJCf2Td4aa	Let him hit it........he'll know that you like him this way.|`|OB2JbmFcaa	Tell him what you wrote:    I believe that if i tell him that people that have nothing in common still stay in a relationship, but they eventually find things in common.    But not exactly the same; you have to switch some words around and such.|`|sXerTGooaa	in my opinion you should never go out with the same guy twice in a row, if i were you i would with another guy and see, and then if i still like him i would just come out and say it , after all he did say he liked you   good luck|`|J4hsuTzxaa	ok listen cAREFULLY..... first you follow him home. so you know where he lives, once that step is taken care of you break into his house when hes not there find out a few things he likes by going through his room. now your all set to make a convo with him about something you know he likes.... and if that doesnt work go to plan B yeah i know what your thinking PLan B. its pretty simple. follow him to a descret area and once no one is around. tackle him and tie him up. then take him home and hide him in your closet|`|78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	Just tell him what's on your mind.
hQNHzc6faa	Never let other people tell you who to be friends with.|`|gdbeVf32aa	you think thats bad girl if you only knew  what on between ggirls at my shool|`|wQSsw8QHaa	dont let people tell you who to be frinds with|`|p1TzNiSDaa	WOW they sound like losers!|`|trZ1NRLbaa	If you have to ask, you probably already know the answer. You need to find some new  best friends.|`|7K2wm0syaa	I understand you, but i think the reason that your friends don't invite you, its because probably your other friends hang out together more or just talk more and are more friendly towards each other. But then again friends are friends and they get mad with little things and cause too much drama. I think you shouldn't worry about them. you can always make new friends. And if they were your true friends, they would have invited you.|`|sYyNyjwuaa	it doesnt sound like theyre your friends to begin with if theyre giving you an ultimatum..|`|59xQlCjGaa	Try talking things out with them.    I'm guessing things aren't really the way they should be.|`|NFepSsXEaa	well  stand up for yourself  confront them  tell them what you feel  and its your choice not theirs  they cant make a decision for you  and if she really isn't your friend when you be friends with the other friend then she is not a true friend|`|bbLw3wkbaa	No, because they want to be around you, but im sure they have a reason?|`|7AtxrHQnaa	You need to be yourself.  Be friends with whom ever you choose.  If they are real friends they will stay your friends no matter what!!!  If they ditch you then you are way better off w/out them!  You can always make new friends, real friends.|`|9Lt96jy5aa	i don't think they are very good friends if they don't want you to be friends with the ones you have now they are being totaly rude the same thing happened with me|`|AA10741561	I am not so sure these are people you should be friends with anyway.  No friend should make you choose between them and another friend.  I believe there is space for you to be friends with them without you having to choose, plus whom you choose to be friends with is entirely up to you.|`|LnUh1VJXaa	Ok what you need to do is choose from my list below     confront them    beat them up    write a note or email    ignore them    tell them can i come over sometime    or talk to a counciler            but this is all your choose|`|6XPe4OuPaa	well it seems like theyre not inviting u for some reason... maybe you should find out...but others ways is that you should stop being friends with them and find ones that want to be around YOU!|`|HqLrSgBvaa	there prbably spoiled bratz or something like that and just dont hang out with them there bein beoches seriously|`|STDctt3Caa	I  would stop being there friends and move on becuase they are just trying to turn you against the other girls.|`|w8xJGEJCaa	nope you shouldn't be friends with them anymore! go be friends with the poor girls that your (almost) EXfriends ditched! i bet they're nice girls! Good luck!!!!!|`|hTidiGwbaa	the truth is, if they're acting like that towards you, then stick with your other friends. if they're not inviting you anywhere, and don't want you to be friends with your other friends, then they don't sound like they're not exactly your best friends.|`|tJ9zAY9gaa	yuou shouldnt be friends with them, especially if they are telling you that there not gonna be your friends if you are friends with someone they dont like. they need to get over themselves and grow up.|`|dCqsL9noaa	They sound bitchy, don't bother putting effort into them, they don't seem to care about you. Find friends who will put in as much as you will, and not make demands or requirements of your friendship.    Hope this helps|`|vSOWMy0qaa	Well why don't you ask if you can come when they get together, if not you probably didnt need them as friends anyways..      There are pently of people in the world, just find yourself some new ones that will invite you to hang out!|`|cr8Yatfqaa	My advice is to talk to them both, one on one.  Tell them your feelings.  If there reaction is anything other than positive, then forget about them.  They clearly not good friends.|`|AA10341587	do not seem desperate for their friendship. if they treat you horribly than friend hunting you go. usually once they realize that you can get along just fine with your new friends they will be wanting your friendship back.|`|mD4qTagLaa	well if you think they're not really ur friends and dnt invite you anywhere then you shouldn't break ur friendship w/ ur other friends (that those2 best friends aren't friends with) and you shouldn't be a pushover either.  tell ur friends that they don't have the right to decide who you can//cannot be friends with. and of course, in a nice way...without creating further problems.   hope i helped (:|`|4OxDLaJLaa	how old are you?  if you are in junior high or high school  dont even worry about it,   friends will come and go you'll   only have about one or to TRUE friends   after high school,  dont get too worried about it sweetie,   be yourself,  and dont let what other people say or think   bother you you'll find friends that'll like you   for you :]|`|rWMcEgDEaa	ok. well my friends are kinda the same way... they never invite me. but i found new friends that invite me everywhere. and if they are making you choose between friends, then they aren't your real friends. i know thats cheesy but its soo true and i learned that the hard way. so i would make new friends. but if you want to be their friends then i would try to fix things by talking to them about why they don't invite you. 3's are hard. its always 2 against 1. and unfortunately you are the  1. i've been there. its not good.|`|rQ7dI88Maa	Find new friends because these people aren't--not when they give you ultimatums. Choose your own friends and leave these best friends alone.|`|RIEwATmgaa	if they say that they are DEFINATELY not tru friends. i have had this experience before many times so i know what it is like. if its girls, this will proabably happen frequently thats is why i have more guy friends because they cause no drama! haha well most anyways=p! so you need to follow your heart with your friends and not your mind.  hope this helps.  xoxo|`|YHIKXWIjaa	And what makes you think for sure that they will be your friends when you stop being friends with the other ones? I think these girls have issues adn they think this way they can feel better about themselves! Find yourself new friends!
Fg6iojkUaa	no hes still intrested, in fact he probably spent hours talkig in the mirror to try to stop being nervous, he doesnt want to look stupid and nervous, he wants to look cool and try to impress you.|`|GoEdpprvaa	It sounds like there's some flirtation going on. Don't be affraid to talk to this guy okay. Maybe he stopped being shy because he was affraid you would only like him if he was confident.  Good luck :]|`|RpcyfAjLaa	if you like him just let him know sounds like he wants you pretty bad he is just tying to not look like he is in love with you.|`|gaNn1kHAaa	first off, ure over analyzing this waaaay too much! i dunt mean to be mean, but u gotta understand, like most things in the universe, guys and gals are polar opposites. while u are thinking this through the smallest detail, he may see it from more of a general standpoint. He may have jus been nervous at first cuz u were newer to him. but now he may feel more comfortable. like i tell everybody, keep it light and breezy, dont come on too strong cuz ppl can tell. be witty be funny, but also dont ask too many penetrating of questions. and please for the love of god DONT COME ACROSS AS BEING NEEDY! hope this helps, i kno u can pull it off!

8U8YC74Eaa	I had this before. Couldn't stop thinking about her. The truth is you're not going to forget about him. It's going to be there until you find another person. But to get your mind off him, you should hang out with your friends. Have fun. That's what I did.  Hope this helps. Good luck.|`|urvq2Kkmaa	look it could be hard to forget about that special someone  but you only have to give time to yourself to refresh your mind  and start thinking of other stuff and to forget about him... you might  not forget him completely but you can forget the majority that would help you to be happy by yourself or by the side of another special someone ....take care a lot and hope you can forget about him|`|4ZjWUjv6aa	same thing w/ me    but luckily i start realizing that there's a world out there, and i don't need him in it to keep on goin...    there's so many guys out there, and one of them must've been meat for you (=|`|yIHlvPFfaa	go out with your friends, do everything you can to get your mind off of him. plan a girls night out, and just go have fun.|`|bbLw3wkbaa	Music, that will help|`|InfvT0fiaa	distract yourself. now  with friends helps most people the.. well most|`|DGIUaDLYaa	What has happened is sad, but you will have to deal with it.  If you are sure that it is a dead end, then control yourself and do anything in order to forget him; get busy and do something that will fill most of your time.

6c694750ebd6aa4c9fc2901e8ad350a3aa	You are a very pretty woman, maybe guys are to intimidated to approach you.  I'm also a smoker and know that it doesnt always help to attract guys but there are many non-smoking guys who do not mind dating a smoker so dont worry about that.    Do you ever approach guys when in the smoking section of a pub or outside your work place?|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Besides the fact that your cute not sure lol. Stop smoking but just get closer to guys you like/attracted to. Your far from ugly. You look like your in your early 20s. So the bar/clubs or university to meet guys? Not sure of your situation so its hard to say.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	You are a good looking girl. I dont think your looks are the problem. Maybe its where you hang out to make yourself available. I dont know your personality but maybe something about you intimidates guys or turns them off.    PS. Lose the cigarettes. I wouldnt hit on a chick that smoked.      YES, I am a hypocrite. I have been battling a tobacco habit for 20 years now. (Snuff)|`|IOXJdCvSaa	Look at us and smile, and most of us will go up to you  And if anything, be the one to approach  Your sure to get a date then|`|kEeUsdnYaa	It sounds like your hung up on the idea that its uncool or somewhat "bad" to be single.  As if that says something about you like "omg she's single...that means ABC-XYZ"    one of the biggest problems both men and women have today is that they feel that they are missing something in life and they try to fill voids with relationships.    I'm not pointing fingers since I did this very often.  For me I felt on a deeper level that I could not be happy as a single man. Those kinds of thoughts eat away at you like acid.    I cleared all that up after I did the Athony Robbin's "get the edge 2" course (CD's) which also helped me proceed into a specialist course at the only dental school in my country.    It helped me, maybe it will be the same or better with you?|`|f878535d0bae9326cb1189369fe41c5caa	I like that pic of you with the cigarette------- i know its wrong,,, but it sure feels right      lol----------------- the one of just your face.

BrEUh8U5aa	every girl is like that, ignore it and find a girl who's rite for u.|`|hoqnGwCvaa	yes i know im a girl but can i have my say in it?  ok well not ALL girls are like that. all you have to do is get to know a girl your sorta attracted to and get to know her.|`|cp2182xNaa	Talking girl? I'm sorry but that one was kind of insulting. A different name could have sufficed. And there aren't many girls who are completely in any of those categories. We all have qualities of at least a few of those. And those are also just the very bad qualities. Unless someone is so deeply entrenched in anger or selfishness or insecurity or stupidity or whatever, she's got good qualities. Same with guys. Plenty of guys have crappy qualities, but they also have good ones that make up for it. And for stupid girl:  "-this type of girl likes to speak a lot but she doesn't say nothing smart"  Sounds like stupid boy to me.|`|xp9IMoWEaa	no, i like romantic girls|`|ncjwtdTsaa	ur right its all bull just go wit the one u can put up wit the most
jpIdtWB0aa	I like the idea of bowling, bowling is fun and I think you could get to know each other really well. The cinema could be good, but you can't really get to know each other while watching a film. Offer her choices of what to do and let her decide? Then she'll enjoy herself :)|`|1UlJRGoDaa	ice skating, lunch, i personally think coffee is a good idea, umm bowling?

KGijHabYaa	Its difficult to consider answering this question, you ask so many yet never seem to drop by to pick a best answer.    I think that satement and you forgetting her birthday are related.    You seem so wrapped up in yourself that you don't consider your interactions with other people.    Lesson 1: It's not all about you|`|Ukde2hWAaa	i think you should get her a gift and see whats she says|`|DyHYuVXJaa	chill dude. shes probably just busy. next time you talk toher, ask her if she got your birthday wishes.|`|I9dw8eWsaa	call her and talk to her and if things r weird be like hey did u get my text on ur b-day??? it was kind of late and i'm so sorry i didnt text u sooner i just got caught up in my day, and if its not weird then just talk to her|`|jqKbyzQdaa	i dont think she's mad at you. its not like you completely forgot...just because you didnt stay up all night to text her happy birthday at midnight...doesnt mean you dont care. as a girl, i wouldnt care...i would be happy you still told me happy birthday! SO RELAX!....just try talking to her more and making sure she knows you still wana talk|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	Let it go.  If she's at all into you she'll contact you again.|`|5b2fd4a4183ac1d65721171ad7b2843caa	Well, I'm not a girl, but I know I wouldn't get that angry at a girl for forgetting as long as they apologized.  I would recommend you wait a few days(in case se is mad) and then try calling her and apologizing.  If you call her while she is still angry, you wont get anywhere.|`|4bfff9d3d23a464bf6c7259bee5d0d09aa	If your phone said the message sent, perhaps you should wait a little bit (day or so?) and call her. If she really wants to be your friend, she won't be mad for long, if she is mad at all. As someone you aren't reminded of every day, she really shouldn't expect you to remember everything. Perhaps at the next holiday you can wish her a good day, like happy st. patricks or whatnot. I do not know what kind of person she is, but just call her, apologize, and that's all you can do. I do agree that this is slightly trivial. Call her and be a good friend! :) good luck!|`|wQJtKx6zaa	I wouldn't worry yourself over this. The main thing is that you remembered. If she wants to picky about you being exact, then I would reconsider this as being a new opportunity for you both.
YhlA2HoPaa	tell him to keep the f*ck away from you and that he isnt allowed to touch you  or you will get a restraining order against him...  that usually works:)|`|V5Mw6rUtaa	You are young and need to learn when to stand your ground. This will not be the first time this will happen to you, but how you handle these situations will have an impact. You need to tell him straight forward. You are making me uncomfortable or I would prefer that you not touch me, or You are not being appropriate. STOP very firmly and loudly. If you can't do it you need to let an adult know and they need to make him understand that he is making you uncomfortable. It is important that you as a 13 year old are not put in these situations.
316bcbd5f19b605b8da74e64073dd252aa	last year, i asked my boyfriend to sadies by having people give him different puzzle pieces that once they were put together said" Will you go to sadies with me?"     It was a super cute idea( my friend came up with it) and he was so confused at first, but then he got it.
1Q7vREwzaa	He wanted to know :D JEEZ, he's flirtin... Hang out wit him :)
3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	Brendan, unless your girl is always this unreasonable she has a bee in her bonnet about your friend.  Either that or she is attacking your laid-back attitude.    I would tell her you think you have resolved it enough - you have accepted your friend's actions and offered to replace the beers for your girlfriend.   She shouldn't have "feelings" about such a small incident - find out what's really bothering her - surely it cannot be two beers.    Good luck.
DDWnAoSnaa	try to think of things to tease him.
7OFf25Nkaa	to be honest i would be more freaked out if someone i have never met before was looking through my emails but i mean theres nothing that you can really do besides maybe talking to her that would help her  hope you figure it out
PbNjSMCLaa	he likes you alot, just being around other people makes him like that, but when hes alone with the person he  likes, it gets awkward and he does not know what to do, keep him, he will get mor comfortable, give it time :)|`|e4320d40393740e3b9148136c56004baaa	Probably feels so official and on stage, no more flash in the pan act and he's clearly not as confident as at first you thought.|`|7oDK0w7qaa	He's more confident when other people are around.|`|EjRDWt56aa	from experience, sounds like he likes a Lot! ;)|`|YQSk0PxTaa	aaaah, thats so sweet. why dont you help him a little?
lRq81lu7aa	If your dress is white, the white flowers should be fine, even if they are cream colored they should be fine. Nature is not manufactured, so if they are even off white they would look nice. You are still in the same color family of white.  But if you are concerned, take some flowers with you when you try on dresses to see if they will clash.  Or be bold and have a burgundy bouquet with white accents.  This is your wedding, no one else can or should say this looks bad or that looks good.  Its all up to you. The color choices sound really pretty together.|`|ghLdIUz0aa	i would do a fall bouquet, such as yellows, oranges, reds, and maybe a little purple. mix them in together, yellow orange and red is beautiful together.|`|1KfbgBupaa	Wear cream rather than white so there's not the stark contrast between the dark colors and the light color.|`|4R93xF8naa	i think thats ok..  but orangy goldish will be better  or silver and white..  but then again that's just me =]|`|IxoazyHUaa	I think those colors will be fine together-when you pick out the flowers, take a swatch of material, from your dress and the bridesmaids dresses, to the florist. they can help might just the right selections.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Sound very classy and elegant I think as long as you have filler greenery in the flowers then it won't just look like too much white, and I don't think it would clash,|`|o1yy6KABaa	It sounds as though you have it pretty sussed to me ;) The only thing I would suggest is that the bridesmaids have white and burgandy/red flowers or something mixed and you have a bit of colour in your boquet|`|pub2GLZPaa	I have no idea about the flowers you mentioned but I am getting married in March 2009 and my colors are burgundy, ivory with silver accents.    In hunting for burgundy things I found tons of things in your color combinations and let me tell you- things will be EASY to find (ie chair covers, ribbons, labels, anything). Stick with those vs some obscure colors (latte or some wierd shade of green, peach, etc) which might look good but it will be hard to find.     I think your colors will look fine- although I'm not much one for black for a wedding- I think the 3 colors do look good together :)|`|rNsCkHEwaa	Those colors will be beautiful together.  I agree with another poster, to add a little burgundy to your bouquet, and a little white to the bridesmaid's bouquets.|`|10OcnWyEaa	hmmm i dont think the white will clash , try adding in some burgundy roses or other burgundy flowers....it should go well.....but not as many as the white....like a few here and there|`|1y1c5QWHaa	I love those colors! And since all colors go with black and white, of course burgundy does! :) Also, as I just said, all colors go with white, so of course the flowers won't clash! :)    Hope this helps you Kelsey Jane!
J7Mmo5Xmaa	Here is what you will be risking.  If you send him nude pics, he will show his friends, they will show their friends.  You will have the reputation of a wh-re with every  person who knows you sent him a nude pic.  If he dumps you later, the only reason a guy will date you is because they will think they can  get some easy.  No to the pics, and no to sex until after you are married and here is why:  "I love",sex,and/or shacking up is NOT a commitment of love, "I do" is.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	back to the solution. I will pray for your departure soon, like yesterday, and you will take it as a sign of love and keep attacking me, harassing me, beliving whatever you believe in your sick mind. some day you will be gone and your sick perverted mind will go somewhere else to harras someone else. I wish I could do something about it, it is not in my hands. A prayer may speed the things up perhaps.|`|gJ0Ygpxoaa	i think you should totally go for it. USE PROTECTION THOUGH. i mean pics are like totally the thing this year. i say just show him in person, because pictures get around. good luck chica. byebye
bEahxLcFaa	she may be hurt some because she does like you... does it seem likes she likes you? it probably isnt a good idea to date a friend unless you really do like her, just dont date her for the wrong reasons or hurt her... trust me i have had experience like that before and it doesnt turn out so great.. but it does for some people so maybe you'll get lucky... best of luck, wish you the best|`|i5iOyCLdaa	I liked my friend once. I have to tell you, it's going to be very hard to make her happy right now, and there isn't much you can do.    One thing's for sure, break it off with that other girl. It might make her feel better that at least she doesn't have to think about you being with somebody else.     Second, apologize to her. Tell her that you'll always tell her when something's going on, and you'll always trust her from now on. And stay true to it. Make it more than words.    Third, try your hardest to act normal. Don't hint that you think she likes you. If you're wrong, you'll be embarrassed, and if you're right, she will.     Lastly, don't date or ask out any girl for a while. It'll clear her head and maybe give her time to stop liking you if you just cool it for a while. I'm not saying that you can't date anybody ever just to make her happy, but wait it out for at least a month.    I know it seems like a lot of work but if you care about your friend and your friendship it'll be worth it for you.|`|U61QKlvKaa	say we can be friends|`|HCWkdk4naa	yeah, she probably likes you.  i'm not a big believer in platonic friendships, one will always like the other.  don't beat yourself up over it, you can't help who you are attracted to.  you don't owe it to your friend to like her back, that's not how friendship works.  if she can't be normal around you while you pursue women, you should tone down the level of your friendship.|`|sGOI14fDaa	dude, she's definitely into you.  but still go out with that girl that you went to the movies with. if she really was your best friend, she shouldn't force you to like her.  tell her to stop acting like a middle schooler (but more subtly)|`|dTdLrjFNaa	She sounds like she really wants to go out with you, but also like a person who would actually stay friends, but not make it weird if you break-up. If you like her, date her. If not, don't hint that you know she likes you until you figure something out.    But you two sound like you'd be good together.|`|Io7x29vhaa	she loves you..|`|H8VmDkhAaa	I think she might be a bit hurt hunn =(    talk to her seriously about it.|`|u32uXIuKaa	Just pray four courage to do the rite thing!|`|6246e0d306150f8d4539a4e8c29e2600aa	awww, you sound really sweet, so she probably has some feelings for you. are u sure u have none towards her, if u would not see this girl because of your friend.     people always say "marry your best friend"     you should figure out how she feels for u before u do anything.|`|vLRrmVXMaa	are you sure you don't like her back? i would make that decision before you talk to her. the answer to that question determains what you say to her...|`|o8uie3B2aa	obviously you care about this girl as much as she cares about you, and from the looks of it, yes, it did hurt her when you asked this other girl out.  don't hold onto the past. the whole "cant date friends" thing can hold you back from having a really great relationship.    i think you should give her a chance, and see how she really feels about you. she probably hasnt told you she likes you because 1. she thinks you like this other girl, and 2. you said you dont date friends.  i say you should definitly give her a chance  remember, friendship often ends in love.|`|xETCO0rUaa	I kinda have the same problem with one of my guy friends. I told him i used to like him over the summer and he got all mad at me. I txted called lefted messages and nothing for like almost 6 months. He never said sorry but now we like bffs. Being a girl i know how it feels, just be sure not to make her jelous, talk about how you like this "date" but don't rub it in her face. Ask her for advice on talking to girls, it will make her feel needed and included. She just wants to know you love her like a friend. If she likes you more than that she will eventually tell you or get over you.|`|eii7o9Poaa	my problems actually the other way round!! first of all I think you have to work out how you feel for the other girl and your friend. You seem pretty into your friend if you wouldnt date the other girl because it would hurt her. Maybe your just not dating her because of you dont date friends? Hang out with both girls on different days and see which one makes you happy and you wanna be with!! but if you dont wanna be with your friend then sit her down and tell her you want the other girl. She might be hurt but you shouldnt miss out on dating someone because of how your friend feels. she probably wants you to be happy anyway,|`|YbfNhS3qaa	ask her if she is ok and if she is then ask her if you and her are cool beans|`|b4RFRoqnaa	talk to her, tell her you don't wanna hurt her and ask her if she likes you and tell her how you feel about it tell her the truth that's the best way. I had this problem once and now we're okay. Good luck dude!
cs8KhiAVaa	you should ask him if you can go next weekend. explain what you just told us... he'll understnad.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	first you say you want to go and see him,,, now you come up with every excuse in the book.    go or not, up to you... either way, you take the responsibility for your actions!!!
hCsAHDjNaa	Okay, so mine is no good story, I promise, haha.  I was 13, it was in someone's basement, a game of spin the bottle.  And it felt like...nothing. No emotion, whatsoever. No fireworks.    My first REAL kiss that meant something wasn't until last summer, I was 15, and it was a little better. Your heart pounds and you get butterflies in your stomach and you feel like dancing all over the place. Looking back I feel really stupid because the guy was such a jerk...|`|WiBOrXUCaa	it was new year's day, 2008 :)  i was 15 at the time  so my ex (boyfriend at that time xD) invited me to his friend's party and i went..  then me and him were just fooling around and we were chasing each other in the back yard (sounds pretty stupid i know :P)  then he came up behind me and hugged me from behind..  then he slowly spun me around and kissed me :) he then said i love you.. happy new year babe .. and it was exactly at midnight xD    it was sooooo romantic xD lol  i thought i was gonna pass out because it was really cute lol  the kiss was very sweet and i will never forget it :)|`|pmkdQKEvaa	first? when i was young at school on the playground behind a tree lol|`|1qSJOp8Faa	It was awful! the guy just did not know where my mouth was and it was unbelievably sloppy! first snog and i had a wet face after it! But i don't regret it at all because i really liked the guy at the time.... its really not as big a deal as you think at all it was on the dance floor for me though and I was 15    good luck with yours and have fun|`|Ism92isCaa	My first kiss was at a party-- a friend's house.  We 'made out' under a tree. He tasted like Grape Bubble Yum, since that was what he was chewing. Blissful. I was 13 years old.|`|JD3srSo5aa	First of all you have to have a boyfriend! Da! But when I was 13, I had the best kiss of my life!  We were at my house in my room! All of a sudden he looked at me. I knew what he was thinking about. He wanted to kiss me! So we slowly got close together and......  BAM!!!! He left after that. But the point is, take him somewhere quite. Let him know what your thinking of!|`|Prm2Uq00aa	Pathetic.   I was standing infront of a library and my boyfriend at the time ran up to me kissed me and ran away.|`|puUStDPpaa	I was in third grade  a guy who liked me kissed me behind a tree lol
lYv7Yh4xaa	SHE LIKES YOU A LOT   OR THINKS YOUR FITT :)|`|iR7StHksaa	OMG SHE LIKES U !!!!!!! DUH!!!!!!!!|`|DxYwNFdhaa	She might like you !!!|`|PSaXWJAMaa	simple she likes you,|`|HvLAoHP1aa	likes you...|`|jVFsl9FBaa	You likes you, a lot.|`|pYcEvMpZaa	are you so insecure that you need to ask a BLATANTLY obvious question to make yourself feel better. She fancies you. You gayer.
t0MiDBMEaa	Start with the basics such as "Hi", "How are you?" and go from there.  Always remember to smile at him.|`|kV3wFWh4aa	he obviously has some intrest in you since he took the time to talk to you..just say hi to him next time in class and make small talk..you can always pre plan the conversation..make up questions u can ask or answers to questions he might ask you..he doesnt hate u but u just have to be a little more confident in yourself..Let him see that your trying to be more outgoing|`|oEWRVYEDaa	He does not hate you, mabye he is shy too....next time you guys have class, you should say something to him, to let him know you want to talk, maybe he thought you were not interested last time you two talked|`|MQ973M96aa	My suggestion is to let time take it's toll if yall are meant to be together then it will happen.|`|tJ7yjkMPaa	no he doesn't hate you.     you just have to talk to him too.    you know, start a small conversation.     Pretty sure he will start talking to you too.
uX2mb40Aaa	The one website I can think of on the top of my head is:  www.chat-avenue.com  It's a website where there are a variety of chat rooms to pick from. Select the one that says TEEN CHAT. Otherwise, you could just Google it up, remember, Google is a solution to all your problems!    [Joking]    Best Wishes.
fP46meSmaa	It's up to you if you want to like him,but does he like you for you or for the way you look after you lost the weight,He is being macho in front of you because he likes you,whatever the reason may be**
Dh5JyqGnaa	I totally know how you feel, and just remember, it happens to the best of us. Nobody gets through life scott free. everybody has to deal with something. This is what you have to deal with. It may feel like the end of the world, but things WILL get better.     Maybe you should go try and meet new people, shake up you depression a bit. Stay around friends, and talk to somebody who you trust. Hope everything works out for you.|`|HS44HUrgaa	you need to write down everything good in your life. and dont say you dont have anythingg. write down everything special about you, and then when you feel like crying, read the list. maybe itll help.  also, maybe you can be the bond between your brother and your dad. get a new pet, even though it can't replace the old one. find a new boyfriend and DONT CRY. crying will make you feel worse.
IalZYnUVaa	If you would be happier just chilling at home, call her and tell her that. You don't have to lie, just say you're feeling tired and maybe you can sleep over some other time. (The whole faking sick thing is way over-played.)   If you feel like you should sleepover, or you kind of want to, then just do it. Worse comes to worse, you can always tell her you're not feeling well and have your dad pick you up early. Plus, if you go and it turns out alright she'll be more inclined to sleep over your house next time.  Good luck, whatever you decide|`|Jlhti4oWaa	Just give it a chance.  You never know!     If you really don't like it there, just ask if it's ok if you don't stay overnight,  but just stay for the day, then go home at night.    Hope that helps.|`|asjzGZqZaa	do what you feel is gut right.|`|a5a5cec9355f01a79a3da430e4e41a2aaa	It's completely up to you if you don't feel comfortable with the situation then don't do it
JaaQ09Sfaa	Don't be offended but i think the barbie image doesn't suit you. I just think the white hair and fake eyelashes are a bit too much...|`|yxoXTmlqaa	You're very pretty. Don't change.|`|48b7amuZaa	Losing the fake eyelashes would go a long way!|`|0L5wlQlJaa	in a word: DAMMMNNNNNNNN!!!!    so yea, ur pretty :-)|`|0mXQODsIaa	you are very beautiful. dont change as you are beautiful as you are.|`|5P6m4Gs4aa	Like to have you  on one arm and  friend of you on  other arm for fun  night on town  You already know  about eyes being  freaky    Jack|`|hjcyJCSTaa	your hot. no need for change =]|`|qUbv1ln4aa	Dont change a thing your damn hot|`|A7EjGpiSaa	DUDE YOUR HAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!... lol but imo put on less of the eyelash make up JUST A TINY BIT!!! dont take out to much! just a tiny bit. the black makes your eyes stand out.|`|Mp2r9Ul5aa	I hope you arent one of those girls that knows they are pretty but just likes to hear it from people. You are really really pretty. but you wuold be prettier without so much makeup. Im a makeup artist actually so trust me, you ahve excellent features.|`|IE9opSHjaa	you look like a lesbian in this pic and is that ur twin sis?! u look fine, girl.  Dont change anything, only the eye lashes are a little over the top.|`|n1Rhv4s0aa	im not a guy but i think your pretty, its just you might wear a little too much mascara/makeup so that might make you look fake, try being a little more natural(:|`|ovIxSVKbaa	yeah, your nice looking but u shouldent waste that on being lesbo|`|oAAhbfnvaa	Hmm, you are quite hot but are you from Essex?    I think you should get rid of the fake eyelashes and go brunette. i think if you went dark haired it would suit you better than blonde where (no offence) it sort of makes you look try hard.|`|cdfec3396aea85b5ac123bfff9ea97a4aa	you are definitely bangable|`|irphzD16aa	wow ur ******* hotttttt i like lol|`|EKu5oJPfaa	Come on....    If that was really you, you wouldn't be asking this question.
R0NfdgzLaa	everything about you looks fake.  fake hair colour, fake eyelashes, fake tan... you look tacky.  some of my mates would hit on you just because your looks make you seem insecure and you'll probably fall for all their talk.  an easy score.    lose the fakeness, it's not attractive.|`|s8d7gg5Haa	godddd   some of these people are a bit harsh   i think yout very pretty maybe less off the make up   but dont let these guys get you down :)    your stunning sweetie   xx|`|zIoWCX7vaa	STOP POSTING THIS QUESTION|`|X40Ww89qaa	like a dude|`|3HhhHWd4aa	You look like a porn star/prostitute.    You are pretty hot, but I imagine you have been around the block at least 100 times, which I think is disgusting.  If you were a virgin, then I would respect you and tell you to lay-off the make-up, but I know you're not...    SO TOO BAD I GUESS!? LOL!!!|`|BC9nPXG7aa	scary.a lot of mascara and fake eyelashes|`|aWvuZJjRaa	f.a.k.e.  sorryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...........  ....  .  ..    .  .  .  .      and i suggest a nose job|`|W0b2oqZvaa	no homo but mah-mah diz iz cut3 idk if ur gay though|`|C7VSrLRoaa	you look fake maybe you should try to look a little nicer and less of a booty call|`|MQf80RUgaa	yea porn star|`|Mp2r9Ul5aa	haha yah im the makeup artist that told you earlier you are very pretty with awesome features, but you need to wear less makeup for sure. Try enhancing your cheek bones by applying some bronzer below your cheek bones and some blush right on them. yah and i agree that you slightly look like a prostitute.|`|6a572f4b6f26a4c454781621261ee067aa	**** all the haters   trust yourself|`|f3O9KQDHaa	You definitely don't look like a girl with class. I suggest get rid of those nasty looking eyelashes, let your hair stop burning from all the chemicals in it, and stop visiting the tanning salon every 10 minutes. You CAN be beautiful without being fake, I'm sure under all that fakeness there is true beauty. God, it must take forEVER to get yourself to look like that.|`|5P6m4Gs4aa	Hard to say with  only 1 pic  Eyes a little   freaky  Smile is heart  stealer    Jack
qif1TQtnaa	he'll break the ice|`|3HhhHWd4aa	1) Walk up to him.  2) Say, "I really like you a lot!".  3) Say, "Will you go out with me on a date?"  4) At the end of your date; kiss him on the lips.|`|QuAHKe49aa	You can't do anything! Its up to him. Give me his email and ill give him some tips!|`|V43Tsv9jaa	Are you freaking serious? I hope to god that you're a troll.    But, since I'm gullible, I'll tell you what to do: Go up to him, grab his crotch, and ask him out.    Hell, you don't even have to ask him out, just one crotch grab and you're good. Jesus Christ, are women this stupid sometimes? :|
wsCBo2Zkaa	Nope i don't think ur boring!!! Anyone who loves Twilight is not boring in my book!!!! Lisa Michelle x x lol x x|`|NberxzXGaa	ahhh i don't know you haven't said anything about your personality.... wow 50 friends|`|F83MqO9Aaa	Sounds pretty typical, boring would work too.|`|DiUx1HzIaa	i'd need to actually know you ..  sorry.  o_o|`|ivUPlEwDaa	I don't know, but you sure are pathetic! Sorry, but it's true.
7b45b063205570aa6efc86471da066acaa	Just ask them what they have been up to lately and take it from there. That is the good thing about talking to someone you haven't spoken with in a while, everything you talk about will be new conversation. Good luck!|`|d75a215506dd9f3e3ff03a3892cfb7c0aa	hello.  how are you?  .......|`|7562562e7d5b159e63351f648e9a81d0aa	For starters, I would ask how they were doing from the last time both of us two spoke. Umm, and maybe ask a question that will lead the conversation to flow. Like "So how's your brother? Still mischevious as ever?" <br>  <br>  *shrugs*|`|BF6yQeFPaa	you should talk about hobbies, interests, and stuff like that to see where their mindset or opinions are and then you can base you conversation on that. Welcome.|`|L5bx536caa	How about "So what's new with you?", or "Tell me how have you been?"  or "You look great, what have you been up to?"<br>  <br>  Maybe those will help you out.|`|dFmFERF1aa	So, what have you been up to?|`|1ed5eaa2f352c3382e77e17eee8d386aaa	umm some good conversation starters are about things you used to do or talk about reminiscing is always a good way to start a conversation and keep it going for hours ask whats new and tell whats new with you talk about your new job or pets and likes and dislikes|`|5c77937fe4c20bec362c1ddfeb7a4b55aa	Just ask them how they are doing and what they have been up? Tell them about whats going on with you right now|`|DVcr8B3oaa	Just say something like, "Oh my god, how have you been?! I haven't seen you in  forever!!" Haha. That's what I would say.|`|ewDl7lYvaa	If they knew your family well or you knew theres you can ask about there family or say something about yours. ex. father has a new job, your brother moved or something along those lines.
N4zrkbrsaa	i rather feel boobs lol|`|W84gB7FYaa	Breast, I have my own butt so what the hell.
AA11814087	Dumping him would teach him a very good lesson. why stay with him, he's a user.|`|BHC52gWraa	Well my advice would be do it back but pretend you dont have money or you coud just tell him upfront....
NzR25cQAaa	No.|`|xe2XFD8paa	you are cute|`|HPntifqhaa	You are very pretty, and I love your smile.|`|NsqiiWnkaa	gorgious|`|W2BZTlbMaa	u r hot n pretty so don't feel so bad about ur self when u think u r ugly u feel like ugly that is full of crap|`|3QG6WLXXaa	fix the link
v0qm71o1aa	Time will help you get ovet it.  Try to go out more.|`|1agrjssvaa	one choice is to become lesbian and post your pics on those guys lockers. second you could take some tylenol with your grandmas homemade sou p and that should clear your brokedheartiness
hv5NjWT7aa	I think the biggest sign is if the guy acts differently around you than everyone else. Especially if he acts like he doesn't like you. Us guys are like that for some reason. But definitely look for special treatment, even if that may be mean treatment =). There is no reason for him to treat you differently than everyone else unless he thinks about you differently than everyone else.|`|HsWFqn1naa	if you think he likes you ask his friends :P  or just ask him directly     though this is like asking how do you know a girl likes you   there is no universal answer|`|EmC8wvMsaa	Well if a guy gives you his llama this will indicate that his penguin is very much in love with you therefor he must be inlove with you . LMFAAO.     kay no for real:  okay so basically signs that will let you know whether a guy likes or not are the following:  1-flirting  2-constantly hangs out with you  3-trusts you   4-sense a vibe  5-calls you   6-looks for you , always wanting to talk to you   7-comes to you for advice   8-if you feel that he wants to talk to you   9-never lets others insult you  10-bugs you, but in a certain way, slightly payful, that gives this vibe.    although some guys may be shy and don't express their feelings in the same way, and would much ratter like to keep it in.   thank you for your cooperation & support :)  have a very merry fantabulous christmas ;)
zzaScg0haa	It's called a break up because it's broken, think about the reasons why you broke up before you think about wether or not you want to get back together
Z3a1cRL7aa	Beings that you don't know him very well you do need to be careful.  But, if you do like him or think that there might be something special there then you should at least try to trust him.  He says that he does not do drugs, but his friends do.  I know the saying goes "birds of a feather, flock together", but this isn't always true.  When I was in high school, nearly all of my good friends did drugs and drank, but I didn't do any of these things.   Maybe he is trying to be a good influence on his friend group, or he simply has other things in common with them.  If you find out that he is in fact doing drugs, then he is also lying to you and that is no good.  I would give him a chance and hang out with him either one on one or with your friends.  Make it clear that you want nothing to do with his stoner friends.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	just tell him that at the present time you do not think you could hang out with him because you have nothing in common. If he keeps asking just do like Nancy Regan and look him in the eye and JUST SAY NO you really need to learn how to set your boundaries its part of growing up.PS. sorry about the caps I didn't know they were on.|`|2XTkSV4daa	whatever you do, don't go out with him. seriously. it's a lot better to say no then to get in major trouble later. if he insists on going out (which you should be able to put off with a simple no, i don't want to go out with a stoner or whatever) you can always invite him along with a BUNCH (i mean a bunch) of your friends to go bowling. but my safest advice is to just say no, i just wanna be friends at school, and leave it at that|`|mqVO95iYaa	just tell him that your not gonna hang out with him if he still does that kind of stuff. and that he should get some real friends|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Invite him to church and tell him you do not go out with guys alone.|`|kV3wFWh4aa	well if u havnt made direct plans u dnt have anything to worry about..if he starts asking u when where what time u wana hang out just flat out say i dotn like who u hang out with and i just dont feel comfortable hangin gout with you...its your job to make urself happy not to make this guy happy so u shouldnt feel uncomfortable to say no|`|XZ63cQmhaa	dont hang out with him if he is involved with those type of people.      tada|`|vZnGAHUEaa	well.........tell him why u r nervous 2 hang out with him! So he has some idea. and hang out with him in a group of your friends so u have a way out if u need 1. NEVER hang out with him and his friends if they make you nervous!|`|9jvtezdpaa	Always have confidence in yourself to say no. Just in case something goes wrong or he's crazy because he's been doing drugs bring friends along to have your back.|`|ZMbxvF5Faa	smoking bud isn't that bad    it might even be legalized. at least he doesn't do hard drugs or is an alcoholic or smokes cigs. i think alcohol and cigs are worse than weed|`|rvztNPGyaa	well dont hang out just when he talks to u say " i dont want to be hanging out with a guy who does drugs so leave me alone sorry." is that good advice i hope cuz im 12 and dont know about boys but i can give some advice :P :D thanks
AA11138696	You are a fool and she had every right to do what she did.  You deserved it.  How dare you think you can just play yo-yo with someone's feelings.  You are very lucky that she took you back, I wouldn't have fogiven you ever.  She had ever right to sleep with whoever she wanted, you wanted a break didn't you? What did you think she was gonna do  sit around and wait for you to play your little games?  Get down on your knees and start kissing her feet that she even talked to you ever again.  You got some nerve to be upset.  You are the cause of all of this.  You brought it on yourself so now take it like a man.|`|96e9e3e784d439b6c40caffb549a8917aa	Actually, in this instance, you both were right. You recognized that you weren't mature enough to be married, and she recognized that she wasn't ready for it.<br>  <br>  Cut your losses, my friend. If you're going to get cold feet and she's going to warm hers in another bed that fast, you two were not meant to be.|`|21157e44a2cca0f85bb1447eb62c0e82aa	the act of jealousy is a sin.|`|b7ea1af63fde864d199e7ac7128c1f21aa	i agree with Cindy Lu..<br>  <br>  she wouldn't do it if you have not hurt her.|`|doh4Oapbaa	Two wrongs don't make a right, now do they?|`|li6nGXpKaa	Did you sleep with someone else...back when you told you...I need a break...you know when you say I do.<br>  <br>  Things will not change...she will always go do another guy.<br>  IF you give her reason.<br>  <br>  I am not like that...but..I have friends who are....if their husbands only knew what the extent of their behavior really is....I had a friend who slept with her husbands best Man...at the <br>  <br>  wedding...and kept sleeping with him....until the husband found out.....and he took her back....only to find out she kept doing it.|`|4437c6be92149dbdaec0d2027f10fbe8aa	Guy, What u have done is absolutely wrong. so, dont take it so much deeply what she had done with the other guy. if u still love her forgive her & made promise her that she wont do this happen again.|`|w0uKHWPAaa	the way i see it if you wernt jealous you wouldnt love her and men who are hurt can only show this in a violent act because men cant handle the pain i think you know what you want not so sure about your significant other
MTwfByWVaa	He definitely likes you. You want to know how I know?  I do that exact same thing. He's waiting because he wants to talk to you. He's looking behind him to make sure you're still there, so he can wait for you to talk to you (haha). He gets close because he wants to be near you... to see if you're comfortable with him.  If you like him, catch up with him when he waits! Get close to him, and don't back off. Talk to him about anything... just not about other guys!|`|MfUMaKcDaa	duh he likes you|`|gC7OMToraa	Maybe he's interested in you but you're never going to get anywhere if you just ask people on Yahoo answers if he likes you, believe me. Honestly, we don't know. The only way to find out and/or get to know him better is to TALK TO HIM. So talk to him sometime.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	I do not know....just go with your gut feeling.|`|PaKdsomYaa	yes he likes you just smile whenever he does and start up a conversation you'll be going out before you know it|`|x3a1T66naa	he likes you.  talk to him!  maybe yall could date, who knows.|`|sYD3CNfZaa	lol then he likes you.|`|4vDVvCK2aa	he likes you no dout in my mined but do you like him is the real question?|`|dCqsL9noaa	Yep, he definitely does. I know its really hard to have the confidence to put yourself out there, but he'll be as confused (or MORE confused probably) as you, wondering whether you like him back. Just brush his hand with yours, etc. - show him you like him! Trust me, you won't embarass yourself, he definitely likes you. You have to be a bit obvious with guys, we have no idea what's going on =)    Hope this helps|`|htMOl3c4aa	That's not how I act
AA10349362	when all a guy calls you is "hot"|`|zg6sgA3faa	When they act one way in front of their friends then act another way around their friends|`|RSFRTYn9aa	girls like compliments.... my pet peeve is when a guy doesn't hold the door for me or doesn't open the car door for me..|`|Ky3XC0eVaa	Yeah I do get mad when guys put so much value on looks, and even THEIR looks. I also don't like it when guys act differently around you then they do your friends, and I can't stand it when they compliment you TOO much your "rate" you. I hate being thought of as a number!!|`|58LH0Y8gaa	This is the ONE thing every single girl in the whole world want every guy to do! don't judge them just by the outside but what is on the inside.  example: some girl that is REALLY hot my have the worst personality, or is a total b****.   If is annoying when guys tell me what to do. They shouldn't tell me to go fix my hair or leave because my best guy friend is here.   another thing guys tend to do a lot is just ask some random girl out because shes hot and he just wants to be popular. guys please never do that.|`|comuT2fkaa	yep, it annoys me how sometimes all they care about are looks,  or how they are so confusing! you think they like you one  minute and the next, it's like they found someone else.
jo9XtOZoaa	First, running it by your boyfriend would be a good idea.  It could be just me, but it my girl was going anywhere with any other guy I would deffinately want to know.    and maby spending a little more time with your boyfriend for that weekend could be a good idea.|`|sCGWcJTFaa	Well it won't be harsh if you let him know first. But yes it is slightly harsh and he should be ok with it.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	since you are going as friends, i think it is ok.  provided you allow Matty to have friends that are girls :)|`|zvHYxpVCaa	i think thats okay.  but make sure your boyfriend knows its him you love :]|`|NDhC2PNGaa	iv been with my bf 2 years and we live together, if it was me i wouldnt do it, you got to think if he did that how would you feel??|`|f2XdVMD1aa	No. Not if it's clear you guys are just friends. But it would be best to tell him about so it doesn't seem like you were sneaking around.|`|tJ7yjkMPaa	Not at all. As Long as nothing goes on, its perfectly fine.|`|7ugNMjHpaa	well,  YES  i do think that that is slightly harsh on your boyfriend  if I was your boyfriend I would be insanely jealous and suspicious of what is going on between you and this Mark.(even though there isn't, i know)    Sometimes it is really hard to be friends with a boy who seems to like you when you have a boyfriend, (I would know)    But MAKE SURE that if you really love your boyfriend that you won't do anything to hurt him.    Best of Wishes!|`|qBl9ShJBaa	tell ur boyfriend and if he trusts u he wont care. but then u have to think how would u feel if a girl asked ur bf to go to a movie with her.but if u don't tell him he could consider it cheating.
YraPn46waa	Men like skinny girls - now more than ever - and small breasts are natural if you're very thin.    As to your face - you're very pretty. Your nose has character but is not too big. You're looking good - of course guys will like you. But try not to focus too much on your appearance. Guys like a girl who knows how to have adventures, without worrying about what she looks like when she's on one!|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	well i am sure some boys will.. however you look a little young to be worried with what guys think.. You need to focus on school and being the best person you can be.. Messing around with guys will put challenges  in you life . Some that there no way young people can handle with out damaging there future  life's hopes and dreams.|`|jf1oPsSeaa	if you put yourself down, youll have less of a chance.  you're reallllly pretty!   and i think plenty of guys would agree with that and if your personality is good, you should have no problem at all!|`|7EM6KnA3aa	You are very beautiful. I would like to have a girlfriend like you if I were young.|`|6a572f4b6f26a4c454781621261ee067aa	i like tall slim girls more than anything slim not thin|`|NberxzXGaa	you're really pretty,  but you're not that skinny.  :)
Bx6xTLRbaa	Every girl has been/is in this situation! I truly believe it's because they're shy. I've always heard that guys say it's much harder for a guy to approach a girl than for a girl to approach a guy. Sometimes we forget that guys are actually really sensitive (even though usually that's how we describe girls). Since he likes you he doesn't want to risk saying something stupid and messing up. Talk to him. Since you know he likes you then no way could you mess it up, he'll be excited that you're talking to him! Awwww, that's sweet, your guy is shy around you so his personality changes and goes into worry-mode.|`|ax6cjSn6aa	um he is probably just shy talk to him and maybe well it will work after that. He isn't embarrassed to talk to you.
HN1zYwbFaa	Me and my guy lived about an hour away from each other. We wrote each other letters and talked whenever we could on the phone. We only got to see each other once or twice a month. We've been together seven years now and living together for three. It takes a lot of trust, and you have to promise each other to tell each other the truth about feelings. Long distance relationships are not good for playing games with. But if you truly love and are dedicated to each other, and put down all fronts and expose the truth, it will work out fine. Good luck!|`|c68478bf085bc0e4d6aaf10a27fd367baa	She gonna bang someone else now.. Look for another girl|`|sIdoUK2Laa	web cam|`|ZwodvOWXaa	go visit her on the weekends and stay the weekend there....|`|OpkGyq4daa	Meet half way somewhere maybe a resturant or the movies or a mall and just spend sometime together an hour really isn't all that far and a half an hour is even better so maybe you guys could find a spot and meet there evey couple days and have some alone time
6QL41Rqxaa	Go out with him and see how it goes you only live life one life! Good luck!|`|wzcvFKKhaa	go for it if you get shot down at least you will know|`|SPQAdHLRaa	Say ok go out with me but you got to mean it!!|`|iKJycf6Zaa	payback|`|XXlAs7QCaa	payback|`|Zwx1RYLoaa	pay bak get some one to play bak at him|`|h8Q3CTOJaa	i have no idea. but he might actuilly like u
3YDPBeFZaa	you ask them out!  ur one smart cookie|`|WzDMqxYyaa	1 word...    Chloroform
5b2fd4a4183ac1d65721171ad7b2843caa	It can that he is only shy around you because he likes you.  So, just say something to him the next time you're both standing there and not talking.  Oh, and guys can just be freinds with girls.|`|Aoax8pIUaa	you for one like him (i think)    but i think his just trying to get your attention.it this thin in a book called "The Game"by neil struss its basicly talking to the other people around you to actually get your attention.    ps.idk but that that thing i said above is used mainly for other reasons idk.|`|EAkTzamnaa	Next time you're next to him strike up a conversation and see where it leads. Build up some confidence and see what happens.
goP5E0Kxaa	A lot of guys will initially find you to be very beautiful, and from there they will search for small reasons why that is . Small reasons why they are attracted to you. A mind is always calculating, trying to make sense of things .     They will begin fantasizing about what you could be for them. Not necessarily in a sexual way, but they develop an emotional attachment.    Small things are turned into hints, or possibilities.     Like if you are easy going, or cool, they may fall hard for you then because to them you become someone who they could be very comfortable around, or let  them down easily , and they can go with their lives just fine.    It's the little things that you do, that they notice, and it is how they interpretate those things, and how that interpretation communicates to their inner desires, wants , and needs. The more desperate a guy becomes the more thought, detail, desires, he puts into the interpretation, the more he wants to fool himself, tell himself that it could mean this or that for him .|`|QxRKQbt4aa	most guys are shallow and you must be good looking.  THey see a girl, such as yourself, and go "damn she is hot, i wanna **** her!"  Therefore you have earned them as a 'crush'
AA10787626	First off, I'd just like to say that you are being a good boyfriend by showing concern for her- so you should tell her that you care a lot.     Girls like the simplest things:  A warm smile when you see her  Bringing her flowers or a small gift every so often   Asking her about what she wants out of life   Backing her through difficult times   Letting her know you are there 100% for her and meaning it   Giving her compliments    And you could always tell her.|`|s8d7gg5Haa	awww :(   i hope everything works out   i think that you should ask to meet up if she keep making excuses call her and ask if something is up    and then go from there   x|`|W0b2oqZvaa	show her your feminine side and be more sensitive girls love that (well most of them)|`|f93e9cf9f4b30e75ca3b2d301994c553aa	the best way to go about this to maybe surprise take her out once, with just the 2 y'all Maybe talk to her friends and family members and find out what is really bothering her.|`|szcA8CDyaa	when u see her, tell her whats the matter and when she answer it u should fix it with ur own plan or when u talk to her, tell her how much u like her and she should be understand    hope that helps!!! ;-)|`|b1b6e3d33b1a99da35a245dd5c6cae76aa	I've had this problem with my boyfriend.  I honestly think it's the sex that ruins relationships. Because me and my boyfriend started to have sex way to early in our relationship and all of a sudden we found ourselves fighting all the time and revolving around sex and fooling around. So we slowed down and now we realize that our relationship is WAY stronger without sex. We haven't had sex in over 4 months. And were great without it.  To show how you love her you could : cuddle with her more, tell her how much you love her, Just do RANDOM things to express your feelings twords her.  Unless.... she doesnt seem interested anymore then just talk to her about what's going on in her head. Ask her if she still feels the same way.     I hope this helps  -Jaimie|`|XQjllI4baa	i had this problem with my ex a while a go, and i wrote down everything i liked about him and what attracted me to him and i gave it to him and he called me up that night and we spoke about everything and got everything i the clear.   so try it.  make a list of everything you love about her and give it to her, it does work wonders when they know what makes you love them!    good luck dude(Y)
64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	read your last sentence, that's the answer. Just be yourself. even if i gave you tips to help you get near him without freaking out, you will have to eventually be yourself anyway, or the relationship will be built on lies and won't survive.     but just pretend like he is already one of your friends, it will help you relax around him.|`|HkyOtIeTaa	just be brave!  if you want to get to know him ask him for his number and text him, at least it won't be a face to face conversation!|`|JaXIaOn1aa	nope|`|EmC8wvMsaa	well person, i hope that your dragon feels better now . how are his children coming along, i heard it was a very rough time for it , i heard they're all grown up now , and one is even married :O     LMFAO .    kay heres the real answer:  kaay so honestly try to get out of your comfort zone, who cares , take the risk. if he doesn't appreciate the way you act , or the way you look or anything of that nature, then he's certainly not the guy for you. you should feel comfortable talking to him, after all, if you expect it to get simple, you obviously cant be shy around him.|`|H4oEg9ocaa	im in the exact same situation. im a sophmore also and im always afraid to get too close to a guy because im afraid ill scare him off. lately, someone told me that if guys don't like who i really am then they're not worth me anyways and its their loss. so now i pretend like im talking to one of my girls...it really helps. also just laugh a lot and show him that you're awesome and with time youll begin to be more of yourself once you realize that he honestly doesn't judge you. good luck!|`|kEeUsdnYaa	I HAVE THE ANSWER:  NLP.  Neuro Linguistic Programming.  Its the neglecting wing of psychology that millions of people have use to help THEMSELVES with things such as what you are dealing with!    I speak from experience!    Google  "NLP"  or  "NLP confidence"  or just   "neuro linguistic programming"    God bless  good luck|`|znd2wDQFaa	just talk face your fears or move on|`|aL0uWmSLaa	well leah what i would want u to put in your mind right now is that u have 90% of the power of the guy trust me the guy will be nervous too and anyway u just have to sit there and look pretty the guy is the one who has to ask the girl out that's a lot of weight on our shoulders so u should just take a few deep breaths and then go casually talk to the lucky guy after u start the conversation the rest is smooth sailing    Hope i could help :)
I4ukTSFeaa	He is trying to piss you off.  eww he likes asian girls.  Don't tell me, he is an ugly white dude huh?  Dump him you can't settly for this, he is jerk.  You deserve better than a dumb ****   Dump is a** with a slap .|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	jerk for sure|`|qpmGLd7laa	An attractive women is attractive regardless of her race or ethnicity...    And yeah, he's a douchebag.  Stop having feelings for him.  You should bang a handsome Asian guy, or better yet, an Asian girl (if you're into that kind of thing) to make him jealous.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	That was shitty of him to date you all according to a bet.  But you need to respect his being, He doesn't want to be with you, So leave him be.|`|dPzXLo9uaa	Yes, your ex is a jerk-most of them are, that's why they are EX'S.  Stay away from him, act like he doesn't exist and that what he said didn't bother the heck outta you!  The best way for you to handle this is to move on, forget about his inconsiderate self and find someone who likes you for you, talks to you in a kind manner and genuinely wants to be with you!  You'll be much better off than being with him.  As for who's hotter:  it's a matter of preference, some guys love asian girls and visa versa and I'm sure there are just as many nasty looking asian girls as whites too!  Good luck!  Remember: you're worth more than that!|`|oFptKbCJaa	well i kinda dont blame him, cause u shouldnt broke up with him, now u tryin go back with him|`|r8CmwwNiaa	he's just trying to piss you off|`|vN6J6nELaa	yeah, he's a total jerk,|`|S3X6O4xNaa	I think you're an idiot for trying to get back with him.|`|Am0xRpEjaa	im part asian and part american so im not sure  lol and yeah he is an ***|`|w4XbSuB5aa	Yea he is a jerk, but i don't really like white girls either, more of a latina dude, about to date one soon, she's so cool and fine.|`|nASsjD44aa	Yeah that basically is a jerk move.    and only liking girls by their race and hating other girls because of the race is borderline racist,    this guy sounds like a dumbass though...  i wouldnt worry too much over him anymore|`|j4JpA35Qaa	I think he is to into himself consider yourself la winner for losing the bet|`|l0muvHB7aa	yes he is a big jerk. and i really can't tell if Asian girls are hotter than white girls.. i come from an asia family but i am a white girl as well so i can't tell|`|1JwnoQ9saa	Everyone has their own preferences...    he was being mean about the way he was talking to you.    To each their own.|`|Jm81qQj1aa	1.Asian is GROSS  2. he IS a jerk  3.i got nothing.|`|jta5L6h1aa	Listen, you are young and this is just a learning experience.  And you should look at it as just that.  He is immature, but you know what as young women, older women, we always see it coming.  There is always something in our female intuition that lets us know that something is not quite right!  I hope the relationship did not involve sex.  Just move on and try to finish school and don't date anyone else in school.  I know you may feel hurt, but when he sees you move on with your life and not spend so much time giving him the time of day, he'll wish he had did things differently.  Remember, he will never let you know he messed up.  Thats just him being a guy and immature.  Hopefully, you are mature enough to forget about him.  many blessings
RmcgrPMOaa	I definitely think he likes you for sure! He's all over you, most obviously with the donkey haha thats HILARIOUS! Also, talking about his pictures is a great clue. However, he could just be really really friendly so take it slow IF YOU ARE interested in him - but not so slow that you act indifferent.    Like when you act as Titiana you have to kiss the donkey or something similiar, look in his eyes or really act like it's real and that won't be too obvious because he might think you're just doing that as really acting the part - but if he's interested in you and thinking about it - he'll notice.     good luck!!|`|C0iCdsFuaa	he may be interested. but please, from personal experiance, DONT chase him! do what you're doing now & if he keeps flirting flirt back mildly. When you get to know him better, ask him out, to the movies or something. But not by yourselves. Invite somebody else, maybe two people who are taken by eachother. like a couple you're friends with. then he wont feel akward, and you get a chance to really know if he likes you.  p.s. this is an interesting situation. email me everytime something happens ! lol (x.dimplesz at yahoo.com)|`|iX2g7dTeaa	Maybe but he could be playing around...    we are doing A Midsummer Nights Dream too!!    anyway, he may like you, but just if you like him then talk to him and if you are confident enough    tell him|`|tHD3xMt7aa	ok he may like you the way he is acting but dont rush what it out a bit more smart quiestion|`|fa2trg3zaa	Hes a banana butt chicken nugget head that loves you. I even asked the radio station.
494498c33ded8b6ae533be026090d038aa	how old r u and are u an only child, ur not really giving us much to work with here...there can be numerous reasons|`|HeOwMaxaaa	if your a boy, do it behind there back  if your a girl, either do it behind thier back or just wait i guess,   but i do it behind my parents back and they think i havent even kissed a boy before, when iv gone almost all they way and have had bf's but im still a virgin :) you better stay that way too! im 16 btw    live your life.carefully.
otTMXJvRaa	Hi Lady Lovalova,    Everyone hurts for a while after a break-up.  Accept the fact that your heart will hurt, but be comforted that as time passes you'll begin to feel better.  Don't try to deny your pain, and don't deny the fact that you shared some good times together with your ex-BF.    Learn from your experience if there was a lesson (was he a player?  you a b*tch?).  Maybe you two simply weren't meant to be, and that was the lesson... nobody was at fault... it happens.    Finally, trust that you'll find another guy in the future.    Best Regards,   - Charlie|`|iR7StHksaa	just think of anything else and know that you can get another person
z6YwEjlpaa	You know what, the same thing happened to me when I was younger with a friend and we eneded up throwing the guy to the lions because our friendship would of totally been wrecked and possibly never spoken to each other again.  So, if you two are truly friends ditch the guy stay friends. It is not worth it!|`|YCe2rIjOaa	honestly no, he should not be yours. it doesn't matter who likes him first or who was friends with him first. trust me, i have been through the same situation. it sucks but just hang in there and get through it =)
G8Y07MTeaa	OK two shy people ...not good! your the guy..step up, be the man and ask her out! hey of course she's shy, all good girls are!   DEF ASK HER B4 U MISS UR CHANCE!!!  WHAT ARE U WAITING FOR?!!!   THANK ME LATER LOL
v0qm71o1aa	Let your friends do it for you.|`|zzaScg0haa	Why not just start talking to her more, and work your way up to asking her on a date|`|seO4VDnoaa	well if your shy and you ask your friend to do it fro you you will probably fell like nothing like you guys aren't going out at all  ok my advice is never ask her out on a letter because she will think that you are shy and she will think that you guys arent going to talk at all so ask her out in person and you may ask "but how" well you just smile at her and just act normal  and then she will right away know that you like her and you just ask her out with a curious smiley face afterschool and then youll probably get lucky and she will say yes and i kniw that because im a girl    good luck...|`|vkH6AFTuaa	It depends on ur age.    11: ask if she wants to hang out sometime with some other friends.  12:      "                            "                    "                         "  13: ask if she wants to hang out alone sometime-that's when you ask her  14: just ask her. if she says no who cares?
Go07H8bEaa	You have every right to be uoset. Its one things for her to have male friends but a whole another story for her to spending time with him alone. I'm pissed off for you lol..I mean its not acceptable for her to break plans with you to hang out with him. Her commitment is to you and in my opinion shes basically dating. If she told she was bored, be careful she could be getting tired of the routine of a relationship and could be looking for something new and exciting.|`|R3Y4gsAdaa	Move on, son. She has found someone that she likes to be around more than you. Sorry about your luck. Who knows why females decide their preferences.......... I cannot predict,,,,,,,,, just see it as it is.    Say goodbye, and go do your own thing.    Good luck,    FF|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	I'd be very upset.  Sounds like she wants her cake and to eat it too.  Ask her how she would feel if the situation was reversed and next time she says your just being jealous remind her that she has given you reason to be.  If she doesn't knock it off immediately i'd probably suggest seeing other peole for awhile.  Good luck   And I rate your body a 10 for the amount of points your gonna give me!!!  :) LOL|`|Ng4UNMV7aa	Yes, of course you should be.    I can tell you your relationship is not healthy. She should not be trying to make you jealous out of respect for your feelings, but also respect for herself. It sounds like she's spending more time with this guy than with you, and that is a concern.    She probably just wants to know that you still care by making you jealous. Let her know how you feel.|`|N3qaHrmCaa	um if your own girlfriend isn't willing to spend time with you, then you shouldn't even be with her.  I say dump her, it seems like this guy matters to her more than you do and she probably has a thing for him.  And you should be mad and upset, save yourself the pain and dump her.|`|Kxk3ZbWMaa	Tell her it's bothering you!    Your girlfriend sounds like a real b*tch, dump her.|`|KPvTY4e9aa	ur girl is not very nice.  u said that she wouldn't cheat on you, but open your eyes she is cheating on you.  in my relationship we have a rule:  NO NEW FRIENDS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX!  she is not respecting u, so maybe it's time to move on.  good luck|`|nkGHpVghaa	Well, you have every right to be mad at her. You don't want to be too controlling and stuff, but if she'd rather be with him than you...then you need to really talk to her and tell her how you really feel. Tell her your not jelouse, you just don't feel its right.         And if she wants to go hang out with him, then Id'e deffinatley go with the two of them. That way you can see whats really going on between them, mabey they are really just friends..         If shes known the guy for a while..then she could be really good friends with him.|`|9wes8wJWaa	you should be mad and jealous because i know how you feel..im in the same situation right now..and i just posted a question similar to yours..
M2JNgbI1aa	well your not weird..people are just different.  Fined people that apprciate you for who you are.  personally Id rather be hated for who i am than  being loved for who im not.think about it hun  trust me i had a girl in my class whos favorite artist  was beethoven lol.nobodys the same okay  and i never had my first kiss or boyfriends till  i was 14 and im 15 right now.hopefully i helped.!  & GOOD LUCK
qVL5R8nuaa	It is not up to you to "let her". She has a right to do whatever she wants. You should gently explore why she wants to do this. Does she feel desperate for money? Does she lack job skills? Does she have a low self esteem? You should try talking her out it by offering her options such as helping her to get back in school or helping her improve her self esteem. Make her realize she can do better.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Only if you like feeling insecure and worrying while your girlfriend is surrounded by alcohol, drugs and grinds on other men for twenties.|`|naySyzfQaa	She's an individual and you two aren't married so really it's her decision not yours. You can respectfully ASK her not to take the job and give your reasons.|`|CS0zw2Z6aa	no...|`|XZIcf5gEaa	You have the power to "let her" Darn your hand is strong, lol. If she gives you half the money sure|`|yktlEbZeaa	no unless you would be ok if she told u she was working late and stuff even if the club was already closed|`|RSFRTYn9aa	no. definetly no. you don't want her to do that. your relationship will be over very quickly and all those drunk guys commenting on her like pervs... definetly no!
GoEdpprvaa	The guy should:  1. Be dressed nice  2. Be flirty  3. Tell a lot of (funny) jokes  4. Take her to a fun place  5. Tell her she looks beautiful|`|2TDtOdltaa	well i would expect:    1. for the guy to do something a little bit romantic  2. say some things about himself  3. ask about me and my life. lol  4. flowers? lol  5. and not to talk about his ex's|`|FgDIEpSxaa	I like it when he's nice to me and things like that. It would depend on how well you know her, but putting your arm around her or holding hands.|`|1Q7vREwzaa	This is hard....    1.Comfort in talking    2.FUN    3.Laughs    4.Serious AND outgoing talk    5.A great guy, my dream guy (JOSH
sMu8midlaa	I'm in the same position honey. I know exactly how you feel.   I think what we need to do is just let our own feelings guide us.  Think of how life would be like without him and what you could accomplish.  Do you see him in the picture?  I think if your old enough you should move to him because things are just going to get harder. If you wait, then your putting your life on hold for him.  Do you really want that.|`|guX3Qi1Yaa	DO you love this person? if you do then you should try to work it out. if not then i would suggest you look somewhere local. life is just too short to be wasting your time in a relationship where you are unhappy.|`|bK0ETaU0aa	If he doesn't respect I think you should break it off because he has taken you for granted and has forgotten how important and valuable you are to him.
Dh5JyqGnaa	Just ask him to socially neutral events with lots of friends, then just hang out with him, and take it from there, it should go pretty naturally if he likes you to, but make sure he KNOWS you like him.|`|AA12259689	tell him u like him and see what happens            good luck
mPIOOUtDaa	I thinking either B or C it's hard to tell but both of those things can lead to something more. (Like Dating)
i5LLgyd1aa	Yeah, just talk to them about random stuff, I picked up women at congress (we would sometimes even hook up in the library of congress!) just be like "Ay shawty I noticed you from across tha mall, you got a shine, and im going to help you get it on" this only works if you kind of look like T.I., however if you're white be like "Good evening ma'am, it is a pleasure, my name is Lord Becket of the Becket clan in Nottingham, it is a pleasure to meet you my lady." and talk in a british accent, then be like by the way I don't have a british accent after you stuff her.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	At 15 you are all ready acting like a jerk. Women and girls are not objects to be" picked up" like something at the store. Why don't you try acting like a kid with some sense and meet girls not pick them up|`|KNQp15hYaa	Say hi, if they seem nice talk about random **** like, what they are doing at the mall or music (girls connect with music well). If they do not seem nice complement them and walk away they just might follow...|`|PtUJNBFRaa	You can, sure go for it. lmaaaoo|`|kVxharmraa	be yourself and respect her! she will fall 4 a real honest man.|`|RdLU5nVOaa	STOCK!lol jk... we girls love a guy thats into what we r into... or u can randomly go up 2 her and poke her... ur only 15! HAVE SOME RANDOM FUN!!! lol im sure she will luagh,,,, nice ice braker|`|9jvtezdpaa	Mall sounds like a good place. But if you're going to talk to a girl don't come off as a stalker! Just be honest and be yourself!|`|k5wDeKA5aa	if you want to I guess lol|`|Y0mRcFqZaa	GO SKATING OR BOWLING....AND YOU'LL FIND ALL THE GIRLS THERE!|`|Hdgl27hDaa	yeah go to the mall, or anywhere  go up to them, be confident, ask them simple questions, and be open and humble, girls will notice bro|`|qg0tzECjaa	they say the average guy gets shot down 9 out of 10 times when trying to pick up a girl he dosent know.    the mall is a good place..  lots of girls there.     just dont feel bad if a bunch of them shoot you down..  keep trying and one will say yes.. and girls at the mall..   well if you ask one and they say no.  whats the chance your gonna see that girl again.. not that likley..|`|uxiXlJivaa	Find away to talk to them.  Like an excuse.  Then dont straight away act like u wanna pick em up.  Girls dont lyk that.  Try and act friendly but not 2 friendly.  Like as if u just wanna be friends!  If u get 2 noe the chick first it will be easier to pick her up.  Hope this helped!  :]]  And gwd luck|`|A4U5folvaa	Mall is ok, I'd say try to be somewhere where you feel more comfortable. Or where the girls feel comfortable to be around you. As someone said maybe a Bowling alley? Billiards? Skating probably has allot of girls. Mall is ok but you WILL be shot down allot. Girls usually don't like random guys walking up to them trying to be a womanizer lol. Also be at the mall with a purpose, buy some clothes maybe.
be9Xw7l4aa	WOW You're good, when my parents used to take my cellphone away, the only excuse I would give is that I can't ever get intouch with them if something happens while I'm driving, at school or with my friends. And they felt guilty!! LOL   I think your answers are really Awesome! Good luck!!|`|E9szvgGLaa	Tell them tht u could not call them in a emegency like if u got in a car accident or if u were kidnapped|`|QyOMkOrNaa	They probably think that you're spending too much time on your phone. Suck it up, and take your punishment like an adult. You're old enough to accept responsibility for your own actions.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	And why can't you just call your friends? I really just don't get texting unless you need to tell someone something and they are unable to answer their phone, and even then, you can leave them a voice mail. (and I'm 23)    If you want a good reason not to have your cell phone taken away, then tell them you need it in case they need to get a hold of you or if you need to get ahold of them like in emergancies.     As for your texting, know your limit and ask your friends to limit texting you. Show some responsibility.|`|AA11311567	Remember that childhood is not a democracy, it's a dictatorship.|`|fdd19f6be025884e97942d805edfbe1daa	Nice reasoning... but your folks have the real say. They may seem to know a lot less about some things, but you can generally trust their judgement over your own in most things - you'll realise this in a few years.    7000 texts... that's over 200 messages per day, there's no excuse for that. What on earth can you have to say more than twelve times every waking hour? You should be trying to compromise, drop it to 2000 at the most for goodness sake... That's 70 per day, 5 per waking hour, one every 12 minutes while you're awake. Even that's a bit much, but it's a start...    p.s. rather than that 700 worth of messages per month, try getting a contract with unlimited messages. You can get them for as cheap as 25 per month, which is ridiculously cheaper than whatever you're probably paying.|`|AA12027614	Mom, Dad, What happens when I am out and about and I get into a wreck or my car breaks down and I have no way to get ahold of anyone because I have no cell phone. >>>Mom, Dad, Did you also know that ( depending on carrier) There are unlimited messaging plans that you can add on and it costs twenty bucks a month versus 15 cents a message and would save you money in the long run.....ya gotta go with the first one. Mom dad, what happens when I am out and someone tries to kidnap me or something and i have no cell phone.....Think of my safety.....:)|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	well they must have a reason ?  you didn't mention that part (besides the thousands of text messages, but if you bought the phone and pay the bill, why should they care?  you are also getting decent grades).    i don't know.. present your case and good luck.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Here's my argument as a parent, just so you'll know have a counter if they come up with this. My house, my rules. There is not reason to be texting that much. It's a total waste of time.|`|9dd059ac6a76722addfd33bf71195e64aa	When I was 39 years old, I heard a story. I found out that there are people walking among us who have superpowers. These people are called Supertasters. To a Supertaster, bitter fruits taste far more bitter, and sweets far more sweet. Then, just a few months ago, I had the chance to meet a real, live Supertaster named John Lee.|`|RATvWWIiaa	Let them. 7000 texts? I only get 100, per month, and i'm 19. you are lucky to have someone else paying for your bill. start being a little grateful. use AIM or MSN or call people!|`|jXSnXjLzaa	What if there were an emergency and they had to get a hold of you or you had to get a hold of them.
pw3y3Eo0aa	ARE U DAT DESPERATE THAT U GOTTA FIND A BOY FRIEND OVER THE INTERNET???????????????|`|2U5cUwAfaa	what is this?  your gay get a life  and stop saying mi its stupid ITS ME!
npnIPbu8aa	Haha, honestly, I feel like this all the time, even though he hasn't said anything about it. Don't call him, and keep yourself busy with other things so that he isn't on his mind. Sooner or later, he'll come back to you. He'll be bothered that YOU haven't bothered him yet. If he doesn't come back within a week, he's a bad boyfriend, and you should forget about him.  Keep him out of your mind, it's emotionally unhealthy, go hang out with some friends, paint your nails, and be chill about it. He's probably annoyed because he thinks that you're too dependent on him.  Boys find independent women attractive.
S482xFGTaa	Well the question is, do you want to go? if yes then go, you shouldnt care what they think|`|ZII6YCk1aa	No, he won't be able to control himself. Hot girl in your house asleep, defenseless, did i mention hot? Bad move girl, trust me I don't want to see this end up the beginning of a rape story or pregnancy.|`|0wEDKeExaa	My girlfriend sleeps at my house and it's fine. I'm 17 and she's 16, and my parents leave town for days at a time a lot. I wouldn't worry about it if you trust him.|`|SptW7fDCaa	If his parents are responsible they will have the two of you sleeping in seperate rooms, so you shouldn't have to worry. Either way, if you're not ready to have sex yet, then you shouldn't do it, or else you will regret it. If a guy loves you he will understand and will wait for you to be ready.
SptW7fDCaa	You have to figure out what those feelings are. Is it the love you would feel for a family member or is the kind of love that makes you want to cuddle with her and kiss her? It's okay if you love her like your mom or dad. Sometimes you may just love someone in a non-romantic way. You also need to know the boundries and not interfere with her romantic love life.     If you think you love her in a more romantic way then break away for a while or spend less time with her. If she's a super good friend that you can trust then tell her the truth. If you think she might be bothered by it or will tell other people you should just slowly stop talking to her so much or hanging out with her as much. If possible take up a new hobby.(Start playing a sport or join a club)      Sometimes even the best of friends take breaks. Sometimes it needs to happen as we get older.|`|A57LMS5Qaa	oh my gosh! same with me! i mean i love her, but im not sure what kind of love. i dont think im IN love with her. but like yeah. anyways. tell her its best if you dont talk for a while. and if she asks why just tell her to trust you. if shes a true friends she will, and drop it and let you go. dont forget to go back though!|`|ZtuLKde8aa	Hot.|`|asjzGZqZaa	im having the same problem! but i have had previous feelings for this girl and i have told her on numerous occasions.I ended up writing her a letter and making her a CD.Think positive and what you really want usually ends up happening.
qoqxJlomaa	Bring your dad lol|`|2egte4Csaa	Let him know that you want to watch the movie because you paid for it.|`|4ujEpNLsaa	Tell him you want to enjoy the movie and dont want to be distracted while its playing.  You paying to watch the movie so you don't want to miss any of it.  Tell him maybe you can do that afterward.|`|rseR7Camaa	Tell him that you paid good money to see this movie, you want to actually watch it.   Girl, you don't have to make out with anyone anytime if you don't want to!|`|8Xud3vi8aa	say u hav a cold or sumthin and u dont want him 2 catch it|`|xQPgLzhlaa	oh snap lol  im going to the movies too!  but just tell him um i dont makeout with guys that arent my boyfriend.  because he will think your easy.
cSOpcKOWaa	There is this saying...  "my boyfriend slept with my best friend... I sure will miss my best friend" If that helps any.     I know it hurts.  Neither one of them is better than the other. i would Dismiss them all and not let them know that you care. put his stuff on the porch and go about your business. Cry in private if you must.. Those two should be ashamed.|`|yQn34zO7aa	break up with ur bf and tell ur friend she's a *****|`|QgCqvtTQaa	dump your bf.  stop being friends with her.|`|xU8ovpD8aa	Drop them both, honestly they are total assholes.|`|kEeUsdnYaa	Keep you chin up girl, thats a tough situation to be in but dont let it bring you down.  Emotions are addictive, bad and good ones.  If you stay in a bad place for too long it can turn into depression.  Trust me, I've struggled with chronic depression for 4 years (recovered) and I recently beat a panic anxiety disorder drug-free.    I would suggest talking to a close friend, it helps a lot to talk it through with someone who is from an objective position.    perhaps you might want to visit a councellor (please dont take offence, I'm not assuming or implying that you have 'issues' or something) and just get some support.    God bless  good luck.|`|d5967bf44111d663a7219ab16d6eb17faa	kick ure boyfriend to the curb and then smack that girl who said she was ure friend.|`|0AlMeOnZaa	Dump the boy.

Maybe you can still be friend with ur bf (But don't trust him, ever)    Hope i help
t2sTqzu9aa	Um, he slept with your best friend... A.K.A: He doesn't care for you enough to be faithful....    So tell him to get stuffed. You deserve better.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Commitment. Tell him you are sorry but you are in a relationship.|`|M2JNgbI1aa	screw the guy.!! he slepped with ur best friend  thats soooo unforgivable.!!|`|axPkzJnjaa	screw him, he should have thought about that. hes just full of it.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	Nope.

Ef him, he's an asshole. You deserve to atleast have someone who won't have sex with your best friend, what scum, the both of them.|`|SptW7fDCaa	This has been said already, but I only want to make sure that you don't get back with this guy. It doesn't matter what he says he should have thought about it beforehand. If he loved you he would have thought about you before doing it.

After violating your trust and LEAVING you, he determines that the grass is not greener on the other side so he tells you that he missed you and you just let him back into your life.  Just like that.   And despite the fact that the grass was not greener on the other side, it's green enough because HASN'T DUMPED HER FOR YOU!  There may be no such thing as a fairy tale ending but this is absolutely beyond pale.  He wasn't worth the wait a month ago and he's not worth the wait now.   There are too many men in this world for you to act like he's the last man on this planet.  Stop allowing yourself to be compromised.  For all the praying that you do, remember: sometimes the answer to a prayer is "No, this is not for you".|`|ElU3WaB9aa	No, stop waiting for him like this. He's having the best of both worlds right now and you're letting him, he would of cos want that to continue for the longest time possible. <br>  <br>  Tell him you are not ready to be close friends with him in this manner, esp when you still have feelings for him. He has to make a decision whether it's you or her. Cut him off and do not entertain him in anyway. Force him to think if he really loves you. If he choses her, then you'll have to move on. Even if he choses you, he can always do it to you again. So the best, is to just move on. <br>  <br>  My fren's ex-gf cheated on him twice, the second after they patched up. He was devasted both times. Now, he's happily married to a better girl who is more deserving of his love and loves him equally.|`|fgKHY4khaa	sorry to say, but if he hasnt chosen u for all these years(im assuming its been years) he isnt going to choose you now. but who knows, maybe fate will bring you two together.

It seemed like he has become cold. I'm really sorry that this has happened to you, I am sure that most people have gone through something like this, the least you can do now is to take of yourself, feel sexy and eventually if he ever sees you again he'll definitely see what he is missing. So do your own thing, girl!|`|f25d781fecfc51036e22dd327944d175aa	sorry to hear that.  im was in a similar situation myself.  i know its hard but its something you have to eventually get over. you need to get your mind off him.  join clubs, go out with friends, visit family (etc).  after a month or two you'll begin to feel much better.  accept the situation as it is and learn and grow from it.  even if he didn't want to committ he should have told you.  that's no excuse to treat you the way he did.  i think its something deeper than that and he doesn't want to tell you.  when your happy being alone then you'll have room for someone new to come into your life.  this time be more careful and don't take any of his crap.  don't allow people to treat you the way you let them treat you.  good luck!!!|`|0b2486b8a439c855c9eb0cbcb35c86e4aa	Forget him. He is not worth it.If he only thinks about himself he is not worth it. Get  over it. Try meditation.It takes some time   but you can forget him. Try getting involved in some service activities.You need not waste time on that heartless one.(Is that the only reason for dumping you or some imaginary ones?)Anyway you need not go back to him.Do not lower yourself further.The pain will be there but it will go with time.Go on a criuse or a holiday trip if you can and forget him. Maybe you became too possesive.If you show you don't care he'll probably crawl back.|`|ClUT6wjWaa	Try your best to get this guy off your mind. Don't even think about getting back with him, he is a jerk for treating you like this. The beginning of the relationships always go well, but later on people may start to lose interest in you when they know more about you because maybe you weren't compatible with them. There are always better guys for you out there!|`|s4MLq5LNaa	Sounds like he doesn't want to be with you. Dont be needy. Just move on. There will be others, trust me.|`|3577a260b2fce069adfb87818dcfa45caa	I know how much you hurt. I broke up with my ex g/f last summer then I wanted her back cause she stilled called me, well she didnt want to take me back and now she tortures me. I guess its her way of getting revenge, I dont call her anymore. I think you need to not call and move on with your life, no contact. Give him the gift of missing you. THe only way to get an ex back is through EMOTION not LOGIC!|`|45910ff03663d59500db67e3c418a1a4aa	Communication is the key. Try to open up the lines one more time. If it fails, move on. <br>  <br>  Next time you find love, and I assure you you will - then go to great lengths to make sure communication is strong so he can come to you if he feels pressured or concerned.|`|5lFueefDaa	this happens only because of your ego, to back him on the track you must surrender your all emotion infront of him and let him know how very much you luv him. <br>  <br>  give one opportunity to your love not to your ego. all the best.|`|AA10498626	Frist of all you didn't say your age.But I take it that your in your teens or twenty's. The best advise I can give you is to forget him,he sounds like a real jerk.Start going out with girlfriends and meet other guys,someone who will treat you like you are suppose to be treated. I'm going to tell you the same thing I tell my daughter's LOVE is not suppose to hurt<br>     Stay away from him It sounds like he has alot of growing up to do, and you will be wasting your time. Your mister perfect will come.<br>  Stay strong.|`|JGnUtk9baa	I am so sorry you are going through all this, I was in a similar situation where this ex b/f of mine totally ingored me!!!

I wish you all the best.|`|PagIhSzkaa	he is just minipulating you...let him go,have a chick night including lots of friend and a big jug of icecream and watch chick flick al night long...then get on with you life|`|SHrygplYaa	Look, its horrible at first, but you have to realize that you're young and you have alot of oppertunity to meet other people that will suit you better, and be ready to commit to a serious relationship. You'll get over it when you realize that he's been treating you badly, and that if everytime he is going to get insecure about himself, he's going to start fighting with you, then its not right. If he really loved you, then he'd put some effort into it.<br>  <br>  Try not to be so down about it; it wasn't your fault. Just keep going, and you'll find someone better. He doesn't deserve you.|`|WJm2HMLZaa	Give the butthead time to grow up, maybe he will see the light.|`|ac5bfacc1ce7125de16b554f262f4208aa	When I read this post, I couldn't help but feel for you hun, mainly because I've been there (not with a guy of course, but with a girl). My first answer would be to tell you to look back on the relationship and look at all of his behavior and at any time, did he ever seem uncomfortable with you sharing his feelings, or communicating with you? If he did, then that could be a sure sign that he just didn't feel ready to committ. If he said that he loved you too soon into the relationship...another red flag.<br>  <br>  Maybe he got tired of the relationship too. There could have been many factors that made him react in the way that he did. That's the reality of it. Maybe he was afraid to committ to you. Maybe he wanted to see what else was out there. Which would explain his erratic behavior to push you away. I think he knew as you say, what he was doing to you when you were having the panic attacks, but maybe he just did not care anymore.<br>  <br>  All of these are guesses but only he knows why, and maybe you should ask him. As for missing him to death...I realize that you may not want to read this next answer, but there are plenty of other fish in the sea and I'm sure you'll be just fine - and better off without him. He doesn't seem to be a stable person if he'd react that way so suddenly.<br>  But your worth more than that.

You deserve it!<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|tTzbhtpsaa	no one can promise you that they will never hurt you cause at some point, somehow they will. the real promise is if the time you spent together will be worth the pain in the end.
3acdd8aec4a5f567650bcf6d92c6a661aa	I would like to know if it's an indoor or outdoor wedding? Are you preparing the items yourself? Is your wedding formal or relaxed? I mean, if it's outdoors, you need light foods, nothing heavy and hot, I'd say pasta salads and lots of snacky stuff. Maybe a pasta choice, like fettuchini. A carving station to make sandwiches fromt he sliced meat. But I would stay away from heavy and hot meat choices. Shrimp cocktails on an ice mold would be fitting! <br>  If it's inside, then it really shouldn't matter! Any food would work. However, I am a fan of season appropriate foods! Ex. You wouldn't want a heavy soup in the middle of the hot summer, even if the air conditioning is set at 40 degrees!<br>  If it is an informal wedding, you could have a barbque type thing! Afterall, you could do it almost like a 4th of July BBQ! <br>  <br>  Have plenty of ICE COLD drinks around and it should be great!|`|Z8hfpIFSaa	food you like|`|m8fdCPiBaa	Are you making the food  yourself? I think this is a weird question. Who is setting the food up while you are getting married? <br>  <br>  Easy things to make for lots of people are pasta dishes, sandwiches, chicken dishes<br>  <br>  If you ARE doing the food yourself, definitely join a warehouse like Costco, BJ's or Sams Club. You'll get the items in bulk, but not pay grocery store prices.<br>  <br>  If you are having a caterer, just look at their menu and choose whatever food you like. I don't think the time of year or time of day matter.|`|xBSm051Gaa	fruit spread, beef, potatoes, the usuals but add something to make it ur own|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	variety of salads, baron of beef, chicken/turkey or something fancier like Chicken Kiev, roast potatoes or something like that, and just all the usual fare. Lots of yummy desserts!|`|AA12209529	Say those words to your catering choice.  They will have several menus you can look  and choose.
f3O9KQDHaa	Buy him his/your favorite cologne! Not too expensive and it'll make you happy too! lol
0dqoVqWbaa	you can not get every guy it is impossible not just for you but for anyone.the reason why the other guys are drooling for other girls is maybe that they are more open than yourself,believe it is not always the beauty, sometimes is just sex appeal which you either have or you do not, in the future just try to be more open like the other girls and success is inevitable.    good luck|`|022a70c3422f4e77c8a63e672f7c2b18aa	Probably that "Flamebroiled" perfume Burger King came out with; it drives guys nuts even moreso than a pretty face and a nice body.

pmkdQKEvaa	start? lips touch try to open your mouth a bit their response is very important if they follow put your tongue in their mouth and move it around,slow gently like to explore lol dont go mad with washing machines etc.... be careful if you try something and they dont like it dont keep doing it....lol well that was detailed|`|f3LrMhqWaa	simple. walk into the party and some guy will come up to you at some stage in the party. problem solved.|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Okay so start with a simple kiss that start to open your mouth a little bit. But don't be too firm or toothy. After that tongue kiss, avoid washing machine syndrome. Have fun. x
5607cc2fb71a02b217bbfc94d124b2b9aa	I understand how that is. I met an older guy on the internet once and we started talkin for a minute. He told me the same thing. We really did like each other but he kinda only wanted one thing if u know wut i mean. We had been talkin for a couple of months then all of a sudden I stopped hearing from him. Its been about three months or a lil bit longer and I still have no idea where he is. So I say u just take it really slow with him. Dont do anything that u will regret in the long run.|`|n1Rhv4s0aa	aww first, its a chat room and people joke around, second, the picture you saw is probably not even him, third, even if he did like you thats wayy to old, or hes a pervert.  so just stop talking to him!(:|`|YNpKs4paaa	don't trust him. i know he sounds nice, but things could go seriously wrong. you don't really know who he is. he could seem really sweet and cute, but not everyone is who they seem to be. if he's older than you, his intentions are probably not good. he's either desperate and thinking that you'll fall for him because you're young, he's out for sex, or he's a pedophile or some sort of criminal. please be careful, dear. i know that i probably sound like your mother, but you really never know who people are online. all the time you hear of stories of girls being tracked down through internet predators, being killed, raped, or forced into human trafficking/prostitution/sex slavery.  i really don't mean to freak you out, but i really don't want you to get hurt. just please be careful, alright?  best of luck, dear. i trust you'll be safe about this.
xggSASTwaa	forget about her. shes a jerk and doesnt deserve your friendship. you might have done something that bothered her (maybe flirted with a guy she likes) or your friend might have told her something you said about her. who knows but if she is too immature to talk about it with you then she doesnt deserve you as a friend. and dont just forget about monday. thats messed up! she didnt invite you. so if she tries to talk to you just ignore, get up and move to another chair. just remember! she is inconsiderate and you dont have time for that nonsense.|`|4Uj2SJP1aa	She is probably jealous of you and did not want you at the party so you wouldn't steal attention from her.  She sounds like a lying looser.  Why would you want to hang around someone like that.  Just remember this world is full of liars and people pretending to be something their not.  Just be yourself and hang around nice cool positive people.|`|60bb7873cbf2ef1cd22c1751eff493e4aa	well you know the saying keep your friends close keep your enemies closer. That's just how girls are especially if your young. she might be jealous of you too and trying to make you mad. Girls are catty|`|vJmuRjljaa	well if your not invited than what can you do...dont worry about the small things...believe me throughout yourlife you'll go to plenty ofparties/bars. remeber they'll remeber you more for being a sweetheart and not a bit**|`|AiTMmgf4aa	call your friend and ask if there is somethiung that your doning to mak her upset and then ask if anything is going on bewteew you|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	You don't do anything. You weren't invited and no one is required to force invite anyone. Its just a fact of life that sometimes we are all going to be left out of something. What you need to learn is how to handle it with dignity. Find stuff to do that will keep you busy and do not ever let others see you sweat. 10 years from now you won't even remember this girls name.|`|MRKFDfrsaa	grow up. i'm 16 and even i know there are more important things than pathetic worries about not going to a party, and why other people are going and not you. believe me, shes probably not worth bothering with. i've discovered that about a lot of people recently.|`|A7EjGpiSaa	Maybe she is jealous of you. OR is trying to get your friend to get something out of you or something liek that so watch out.|`|Swq4mcPdaa	first, the girl wanna steal ur best friend. ignore her, cause if ur irritated she'll like it. act like u dont care. do something that seriously crushes her. or shes probably jealous. ignore her, but keep her close. option  2 is becoming friends wit her.
KdGnOIuRaa	Im guessing from your question that you are really young...Men have alot to learn about being a good boyfriend too! The only way to be sure as to why he thinks this..is to ask him what he would like for you to do to make him happy. If he is your boyfriend..then he must have liked you in order to want to date you..so you must have been doing something right! He sounds very immature. Dont change who you are for someone, unless its something you wanted to change for yourself anyway. He should love you for who you are. Dont do anything for him that isnt something you believe in. Be true to yourself..and he will love you for the person you are.|`|8o46SYApaa	sweetie, baby, cutie, honey, my sexy, my hottie, something like that|`|wzcvFKKhaa	from a guys point of view does he act like he loves you and if he does any pet name works when my wife calls me pet names in a sexy voice it works for me and some times alot of guys get good cold chills from a girl that lightly scratchs his back with nail or when you use his pet name do it soft and sexy in his ear with other info you know like i love you and stuff along those lines|`|Prm2Uq00aa	He sounds like an a**hole.|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	lol a nickname for blake!!!!!!  idk bout that     be a good girlfriend, tell him you love him, show ur emotions|`|VOYSmwOXaa	honey,blaky (lol),hotty,?  Talk to him k!|`|KrYbNZi8aa	Don't call him pet names.  Trust me.  thats not exactly the way i'd go.  be flirty with him  compliment out of nowhere  keep him on his toes  SURPRISE him.|`|rISPXbiLaa	i would prefer to tell someone you love him/her at the right moment instead of just forcing it out...and just make the opposite sex feel good about themselves...    regarding the pet names...that should be determined by you...I created nicknames for my gf myself...and she did the same too..    GOOD LUCK :)|`|6ZfbuWaIaa	well its good that you are not a good girlfriend as you said. What if you are a good girlfriend and hot?you will have a lot questions to be answered with blake.At least you could tell him that you are in experienced and that he could help you to be a better one. Why dont you call him,beh as in baby|`|513v3vFdaa	hmm call him, blakely, or fredrick, maybe not fredrick...yeah, dont call him fredrick    and why does he say your not a good girlfriend in the first place?|`|9jvtezdpaa	I think you have to talk to him and ask him what would make you a better girlfriend. Talking is like the best way to solve things. When you know what will make you a better girlfriend do those things. I think some good pet names could be Honey Bunch, Sugarbear, or the first letter of his name with bear after it! Hope this helps.
d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	I hope he meant dating you, if not then he probably has a couple of girls on the side taking caree of him|`|6rxOjhk4aa	well just ask him. don't side step it, ask him and you will know|`|lgpHurteaa	Yes, if he has been acting differently lately and treating especially you better than most people he knows.
Bz6IZnoFaa	14. but i had mine really late. most people have it at like age 12ish. and well actually mine was on accident with an 18 year old. he was trying to surprise me from behind a/8nd i turned around and we bumped faces.. and mouths.. haha.. its was so awkward afterward because it was while i was at work and everyone was like wooowwww... and we both turned really red.. good times... good times..  but i think 11 is a little too young. i think you should be at least in jr high (7/8)... yeah.|`|QvN5FhFnaa	i was 14 it was on my front porch at night :)
sMu8midlaa	Sounds like your worrying that something is happening that's why your stomach hurts. If it's sore tell your partner to go easy on you next time and to use lube, lots of lube.  I think your stomach ache is just all in your head. Just don't worry about anything. Just think about how you felt at the time ;)|`|DDWnAoSnaa	i dont know maybe an infection if the pain persists see a doctor.
pWArTam4aa	Honesty is pretty important - don't lie to me and I won't lie to you.  It's pretty simple, actually    But so is intelligence - I don't want to waste my time trying to have intelligent conversation with an idiot    And a sense of humor - again, I want someone I can laugh with    And a sensitive side - who wants a sports-addict who has no emotions?    LOL - OK, so that was more than one but... oh well!|`|nUvdU3b4aa	intelligence|`|tUwXiYShaa	trust|`|2qie5H3Kaa	similiar sense of humour,someone i can be myself with,awesome hair,stuff in common|`|F08qx2hgaa	Heh, it may sound kinda bad, but spirituality. I'm Christian, and if they uphold Christian virtues, whilst still finding their OWN laws and interpretations in the Bible... I like it.    I need someone to be able to talk to about these things. Religion is a major part of my life, and I much prefer that it's a lot to that special guy as well.    Besides that, I'd say kindness. When a guy tries to impress me by putting down others, it's a huge turn-off. And I'm attracted to the gentlemanly guys...    Think I have high standards? They're probably nearly impossible to meet (more so the first one), but that's the fun of it all, eh? Finding that person who is right for you.
npnIPbu8aa	She probably still craves your attention. My guess is that she's still attached to you. You should ignore her, or make it very clear you're interested in being only friends with her...  unless you're not haha.|`|3HhhHWd4aa	She wants you to fight him and come claim her.    This has happened to me many times in my life, very annoying...    Just ignore her.|`|DP5Dt5jJaa	Maybe she still has feelings for you even though she has a boyfriend,or she just might still care about you and to see what your upto.I dont think that its a bad thing,unless you are not friends with her r you dont like her as a friend.
gYzEvFb1aa	My first real kiss was with the same guy im with now. We were both 12 and it was so awkward. Neither one of us knew what we were doing. We were leaving each other to go home and he walked me to the train station, then he went in for the big kiss. It was really weird cause we were both really young and clueless at that, but its good to say its been years and years and were still together. Not only that, but he's my first real boyfriend and he was my first kiss as well.|`|yktlEbZeaa	my first kiss was when i was 13 and it wasn't really romantic but it was by a water fountain with my boyfriend.|`|QvN5FhFnaa	really great & romantic :)
xQxF3uJCaa	let your friend know that you like this guy and that you have dibbs, if shes a friend she'll get the point, and there is nothing you can do about this guy and his girl, its their lives, you just have to w8 and b there for him when he falls, dont let it get to you, your feelings shouldnt be controled by somone whos feelings you dont already have|`|lHDq5gEraa	Well why are u still waiting around? Talk to him and see if he feels the same way and if he doesn't who cares? Get over him
xEzmQMDtaa	maybe where you asked her out? that'd be sweet in my opinion. (:|`|ivUPlEwDaa	The lips might be a good place? If you location, anywhere. Don't plan it out, it will only make the kiss awkward. Kiss her when the time is right. The location doesn't matter.|`|QvN5FhFnaa	when you guys are hanging out and it comes to a romantic moment where your sitting close together or something :)|`|JdeHNikeaa	under a nice big quite tree.i know this stuff im a girl.tip:give her a present after.
RzJSLMH8aa	Look it all depends on how much exactly he likes his exgirlfriend, if he doesnt mension her alot or accidently call u her name then ur fine. Stay wit that foo and wait it out. Youll kno win 2 break up wit him|`|NoT3WGaEaa	Break it off.|`|z6YwEjlpaa	If your gut is telling you that there is doubt do not go against it or you will be in for a heart ache. A guy who truly wants you and only you will definetly not be saying he feels still 1 percent for the other girl. That's absurd! Try telling him the same thing. "oh I love you but is it okay that i still like 1 percent for my ex? I bet you he won't like it one bit.|`|3ZnjKIuAaa	hey.  if i were with him i admit i would be worrying about that 1/100 that he likes her and 1/100 that he isnt with you.  he probably just isnt over her yet(duh) so just make sure he knows your there for him.  but i think he likes you.|`|KZEp26vBaa	my suggestion break it off.|`|QYE1ldfCaa	I think it's to early for the word love, maybe like alot . If it was love there wouldn't be a 1% for the ex. So you have to decide if you want someone who thinks like that at your young age.|`|PEeyeswIaa	it could just be that he met her and memories started to come back  he may not even like her  stay with him until you have a real reason to break it off|`|lgpHurteaa	Yes break it up, because even the 1 is something. A guy should know he loves you 110%. If I knew a girl I would want to spend the rest of my life with I would never ever mention a "1". That boy just wants to keep you until he makes his decision..
bFDeOXvYaa	Let them both know that you like them, but make sure you let them know you also like the other. This will help you learn if either of them like you.|`|77NzfiVkaa	You act like all that matters is whether you like them. These guys might not like you and then you might not have a choice.
2U5cUwAfaa	out of your butt huh................ew =/   deal with it just a guy being a regular guy.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	that's disgusting, not only that, it's unsanitary|`|oU1yUxwwaa	what in the world?|`|pgdM87K3aa	um... dump him he's gross. Did you do it?
jwRcAOtfaa	you should focus on a guy your age. and by the way(not to make you mad) but he is dating a really tall pretty girl who was on miss universe who he met while judging... and sorry but how will you get him? its not like you can just randomly find him. sorry but its desprete and i bet (not trying to sound mean) but your life probably isnt so perfect and your looking for perfection and dreaming about it(as in drake bell) so your trying to focus on something you'll never get. you should focus on school, friends, sports, grades rather than movie stars. and also if you really want to know alot go on different websites like his personal one, wikepedia and magazines that interviewed him

goSI2nAEaa	Your wife cannot legally "bypass" your rights to a child if you are the biological father.  It is your child and hers and a child has the right to know both parents.  Look up this link to see if it helps at all.  www.divorcelawinfo.com/states/ga/gacusto...  Good Luck|`|833d3998e43d4ddd7ca29670d85d6648aa	There is no hiarchy, per se.  Custody is not supposed to go to only 1 parent, at the least you should be awarded joint custody.  Your wife may be "trying" to pull crap on you, but unless you are an unfit parent - & you'd have to REALLY be unfit- she CANNOT keep you from seeing your child.  Start by documenting everything - dates, times & circumstances.  Try to have an unbiased 3rd party with you when you pick up or drop off your child so she can't try & say you got violent or anything.  If you are able to, consult a family law atty immediately.   Show her you aren't playing.  Fight (nice) for your child.

42400cbb1dde89befcb5d823f70a4385aa	A guy isn't be gay because he likes to dress-up in women's clothes for fun, he'd be gay if he liked men. And it is fun to dress-up in women's clothes, also read about or watch transvestites. I'm sure he does like women & dressing up in their clothes too.        jk|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Does not necessarily mean he is gay, kinky yes.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	No, gay is when you are sexually attracted to men.    Liking wearing woman's clothes isn't gay in itself, nor is enjoying watching cross-dressers or transvestites.     Plenty of happily married straight men enjoy wearing women's clothes. Not all gay men are into crossing-dressing or that kind of thing.|`|e158WyFGaa	Yess....duh|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Nope...he is gay if he is only sexually attractted to men|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|mB5bL8ilaa	He wouldn't be gay, he would be a transvestite.|`|det8kK0daa	yes you would  :D|`|4x5ajsUpaa	Well he certainly isn't full of testosterone that's for sure, I think the claiming to like women part is sheer denial.|`|XZIcf5gEaa	He does, he wants to be one|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	just dressing in women's clothes does not mean your gay if you do it for fun or not.  there are lots of men who like to dress as women that are not gay and don't fancy other men.  in my view a gay man is a person that likes other men in a sexual way  and good luck to them|`|Umsj08pnaa	No. Most transvestites are straight.|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Tranny!!!!  =]|`|xZOHlSXsaa	It's not gay because "gay" means that he likes / loves other men.    If he dresses up in women's clothes then while, no, it's not gay, it sounds like a "fetish".    I hate that word... there's nothing wrong with it, it's his personal preference.    Hope this helps =)
nmuyCTsLaa	I'd just keep texting, and ur idea is fine if it's been at least and hour.  If not wait a while.|`|hnEYB04Paa	Well go up to him and start making out with him (so he'll be coming back for more). Or have wild sex and purposly get pregnant so he'll have to marry you. Give him a lap dance during lunch (show the boobs). This always works for me. That's why I had 5 husbands and 17 boyfriends.
9u4sZIsUaa	First of all, I'm a girl and you sound like a really good guy! As I was trying to think of something to say to answer your question I thought 'he sounds like he's just honest and really intelligent'.    So yes, you seem like that to me and the best way to start talking to a girl is to first let her know you exist! Smile, open doors for her, be a Gentleman. Nothing is more attractive to me than a gentleman and when a guy is genuine.     Don't be nervous, talk about school, classes, if you don't get a question on your math worksheet, as a girl. Do anything to let her know you exist. Dont be too overly pushy either though, casual is the key.    Then you start to say 'hi' wave to her in the halls. Ask her how everything is going. Listen what she has to say. Treat her like you would any of you guy friends as in that you talk about school and things.    Then, you move into making jokes if you're funny. Laugh, tease a little but very nicely. And simple conversations everyday can and will often lead into deeper relationships.    Overall, start small, be genuine, be kind. Nothing makes me want to talk to a guy more when they are like that. Good luck!|`|uFymsQhQaa	Calm down become a girl's friend and just be yourself|`|9QYAW437aa	Talk normally like you would with a guy, but know that it's a girl, so don't talk about gross things or anything.    Also, don't annoyingly poke her every time you see he to ask some stupid question like "Nice weather" or something. Girls want to talk about other things. Compliment her and make her laugh. That's a way to a girl's heart(: It is to mine anyway. Like you're in the hallway with her, walk her to her class or something (when she's not with any friends or something) and have a casual conversation.    Girls just want genuine talk. Not that hard...    GOOD LUCK!|`|PxVDtnSzaa	It sounds like you already know the answer.  But because you've already discounted the entire Yahoo Community, I won't expect you to read my post.  Why are you here? What are you looking for?  You need to embrace who you are, and conquer your fear of us females. We're really not that bad. Well, at least I don't think we are.  Just buy me a bag of cheezits, and I'll sit and talk with you for hours.|`|tbwlQFNYaa	its really not as hard as you think. we dont reject conversation, at least i dont. lol. just say something casual like "did you get the homework last night" or something like that. and just keep the conversation going. dont make it seem like such a challenge. getting a girl to talk shouldnt be dificult =]|`|q8YnfCgnaa	I am a girl and personally I like it when the guy is the one that comes up with what they want to talk about and then bring me into the conversation. So if/once you have a girl you want to talk to think about something deep you can bring up and then maybe if you get close enough to her you might get your first kiss. :)|`|4ujEpNLsaa	The easiest way to talk to someone is if you have something in common. This way you have something to talk about.  Someone in class ask about the test, someone in a sport ask how the game went, etc.  This is better then going up to a random person.|`|QuAHKe49aa	Google the book "Magic Bullets" it teaches you everything you need to know!    Here is the link: http://www.lovesystems.com/0/12    It won't just help you get girls it will change your life forever. It will change your personality, career path, social status, and much more|`|QWNNuhAJaa	Well, I am a girl so I should know a lot about them. What you do is talk about what you like or what you think she likes. If you bring up something both of you like, that means you have some chemistry. Or, compliment her. Don't say she has a nice rack or a nice butt or anything that night offend her. Say something like "Hey, I like your shoes." Or "Hi. I noticed you gave the right answer in class today. Good job!" Look, the key is, be nice. And look into her eyes and not at the ground, so she knows you mean what you say.

Wearing underwear that needs to be thrown out because it is stretched out of shape, has holes in it and needs bleaching.    Shaving their heads.    Having grease on their hands and under their fingernails.    Spitting in public.    A guy can be a "prince" or a "king" but a girl can't.    Wearing an athletic supporter.    Checking the box that says "male" on any form.    Having a draft card because men have to register for the draft but girls don't.    Using the men's room.|`|mYSrB7yeaa	Going shirtless.|`|XDRRg5o4aa	writing our name in the snow.|`|ktq7lF81aa	We can get away with not removing body-hair.
lQGDV7MEaa	Putting out is always a guaranteed method...  Just sayin' what the others are thinking.
PCcbECdZaa	Do what she says lol. Her opinion isn't going to change. That's how us girls are. If we feel you guys don't talk to us enough, we feel it! You can't change it UNLESS you change how much you talk to her. So I suggest you either obey or Olay! and dump her. ha|`|JpmKtpqmaa	maybe talk with her more.....just txt or call her to listen to her voice and stuff like that!!!|`|s8QbZ0RLaa	Haha, she's a jerk. Forget about her. If she can't act mature about it, she's not worth it.|`|AA10529674	Do what she wants you to do. Be more emotional in the text messages you send her. In the messages, tell her how she makes you feel. You can also tell her how beautiful she is to you. Girls love that stuff.
PxVDtnSzaa	What exactly is a bhutt? Please clarify.|`|WbKu0t5taa	HAHA love the 1st answer!!!  idk i am a girl!!|`|A4U5folvaa	I would prefer she don't have one but if she does if it looks cute I don't mind. It doesn't really matter at all actually. Lol.
3343f105addf7a9d26fc55ad32c8bdd9aa	Just act normal. Just say hello, and ask him how his day has been going or something like that. Say something that is not as personal (like if he was on a sports team, don't say how's the team doing) b/c he'll think you are stalking him, lol. Just act yourself. Hope this helps.|`|40qTdKuPaa	If you want to know if he likes you or if you want him to know you like him, you have to tell him. There is no other way he is going to know unless you do that .Just be confident, and say hey, and its all history from there. Its easy once you do it, you will feel dumb that you even asked this question. Hope this helps, and good luck|`|szcA8CDyaa	ask him everything you want to talk about. examples. hows it going, may i sit with you.|`|xWYEQm1Vaa	daphne?|`|bf3914759431a2f8053994ebecf71128aa	look if u dont want to seem akward then ask him somethin bout school  and then just start sayin stuff get a convo goin  u might not succeed the first time but try again|`|gaNn1kHAaa	well, first start with one liners as u stroll past his desk. just little stuff to poke fun at him, at the same time not letting him kno ure interested. for example: u walk past and he drops his books, u reply "now ure dropping stuff!" or hes walking in front of u, "geez can u walk any slower?" things like that. u need to first let him kno u exist. i kno it sounds too simple, but it works. If you sat next to him in class, that'd help too. hope this helps!|`|pYcEvMpZaa	Play it cool. Ask him a question about school stuff or just exclaim " We could be doing better things with our time than this load of *******" and he'll laugh and once there's laughter, it should begin to feel comfrotable and easy. xxxxx
MQb4I2w1aa	usually it means your going to orgasm so keep having sex dont stop because of feeling you have to pee or you'll ruin it!|`|oN92aOUraa	Hi '  I have so been there and i had to pee so bad i had to stop. It kind of ruined the mood for a little while but once we started making out again it all came back together.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	go first|`|J3lUKBKPaa	i no it sounds nasty but your man is supposed to  do things to you that make you feel so good you loose control that is normal so don't stress about it just wait til the first you fart you will be embarrassed beyond your wildest imagination but yes this to is expected at least if he is doing his job right
bgbUQ3Wnaa	I understand. She really wants to be just like you. She wants to have the same style you do, hangout with you, and do the things you do. You may not realize it, but she looks up to you. Not to sound creepy, but I do this sometimes to this one girl who is really cool and I want to be like. You have a right to be annoyed and through fits, but be nice about it. Try getting to know her better, and if you already know her very well, just tell her you would like some space.    Good luck, DUDE!!!  ^LOL|`|fHHeal1Vaa	can you please give up on your life so I finally can laugh again and breath air of this wonderful life around me that you are sooooooooooooooooo jealous of. please. I will pray but this it will be better. deeper. every day it will be better and deeper prayer. eventually you are GONE! what happiness for this planet.|`|gZn622dEaa	Talk to hare and tell her that you feel uncomfortable with her doing certain things.If you still want to be friends with her just let her know that you still want to be friends with her but you want her to stop doing the things that you don't like.    If you don't want her to be friends with her tell her that some things that she does creeps you out and that you don't want to talk to her any more.
F08qx2hgaa	1.)Talk to them. It can start with, "You know, we've never really talked before. You're ___, right?" Nonchalantly ask them how their day was, or how they did on midterms (a lot of school just had them...). As you talk, you learn more about a person and what they're into. Then you can talk about those things together. Smile as you talk, and try and hold eye contact without starig straight into their soul (that may freak them out ._.).    2.)Once you get some good conversation going, ask them to go to a movie. Just start by saying this movie sounds interesting. If they agree, tell them that you were going to go, and ask them if they would like to come with you.    3.) Once you know eachother a bit better, you could hang out after school, at eachother's houses, etc.    It all starts with showing that initial interest! Show them that you'd like to talk to them, and initiate conversation.|`|comuT2fkaa	you talk to them and make friends with them.  it's the best way.
Rq3KgTxMaa	Let me tell you what this girl once did to start the touching, I wasn't into her but she really wanted me to touch. First, she told me a funny story to get up to the mood. Then told me my fingers looks tensed, it blowed me off cause no girl ever told me anything like that. So i gave her my hand, she started touching me. I wasn't really attracted to her but it really turned me on. I said we better stop it now. You can try something like this. If he isn't touching you because he is scared, this will make him more comfortable.|`|GQfQ0TsDaa	how old are you guys? calm down. you can get in a lot of trouble for sexting. please. think before you do anything.|`|pYcEvMpZaa	Don't call his penis a "hand". Don't think he'll like it. Don't feel you have to act promiscuously in order to impress this guy. If you've only said hi to eachother then I think he'll be a tad confused if you grab his willy.|`|d5967bf44111d663a7219ab16d6eb17faa	you sound young and if you need to go on the internet to ask someone who you approach rubbing a 'hand' then i think you guys need to sit down and talk to eachother more...like alone.    the more you talk to eachother, the more comfortable you will be together.    ps: what exactly is sexting? i'm not making fun of you. it's a legit question.
gZk3pjF2aa	theres no point in straightening your hair because you will be getting extra hot and sweaty, so wear it curly but you'll probably end up putting it up anyways (:|`|veeIbyV4aa	I have curly hair and striaghten it too, but if I were you, I would just striaghten it anyways and put it up if you get all hot & sweaty.    And, just wear a band shirt and shorts and sneakers (not sandals)|`|Gkf0dWYdaa	WEAR A HAT AND INVITE ME! DUH!
MX1shAbcaa	Try to talk it out, if it dosen't work then man there is only so much you can do  Best of luck~William
v0qm71o1aa	Tell him and wait for his reaction.
MQ973M96aa	honesty, love, and a friend.|`|AdTnizwOaa	Hm..personally, me as a girl, I tend to like their personality, and sense of humor. As for physical features, eyes, and hair =]|`|m6xvhlJqaa	Truthful, not a flirt with every gurl, cute, sweet and will like/love you 4 who u are!!|`|t0MiDBMEaa	Old school romance! Opening the door, flowers, dinner and romantic get aways.|`|wmtbNdO0aa	Love and friendship and honesty.|`|sYxtPBziaa	Perfection. =)|`|eG6brYYJaa	i just want him to be NICE to me.   and sweet, and won't care if he's in front of his friends, he'll treat me the same.|`|q3pYiOCBaa	Honesty, loyalty and respect.|`|AhwK57eiaa	Depends on the girl. I prefer someone confident and funny, and someone who respects me, instead of asking for sex.|`|YLpzo5G6aa	Personally, what I would like in a guy is honesty, trust, understanding, and most importantly love. Most guys tend to have difficulty showing their emotions for a girl but nothing thrills her more then a guy showing or telling us exactly what he's feeling for her.  I personally love it when my boyfriend puts his hands on my cheeks and tells me, "I'm totally in love with you" and kisses me right before he gets out of the car. You know girls what what everyone wants...affection and belonging.|`|tX40VG9Xaa	Personally, most of the guys i know just want a relationship for the physical stuff, basically so they can get laid or just look like they can get a girl. but soo many girls dont want that. personally, im into sensitive guys who actually have feeeelinggs! and most guys try to show of by being jerks to impress their frends. never do that. ever. anyway i love guys who are funny, too. anyone who can make me laugh without being a jerk is great. and if u hav a gf, never crowd her too much. unless she loves hearing "ily"every 3 seconds....yep. thats it.
hWd50Lk8aa	Sarah,    This is a tough love statement.    Your most valuable asset is 2 1/2 feet below your chin.    This guy is interested in one thing only. He will listen to you between banging, and if can do it 4 times in one night there is not much talking going on.     I strongly suggest you tell him you only want to talk and see if he shows up. Be ready for him to come on full force because if you can give it up that many times a night, he has hit a gold mine.    Now go drink a beer and find another booty call.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Because you give him what he wants. It will always be the same unless you change it and if he really cares he stop until your ready. If not move on|`|RaVC1ksHaa	what ?|`|0nW8wMBdaa	He can't be a good friend if he will only see you for sex. He just took advantage of your vulnerable state of mind.Get a real friend.|`|GoEdpprvaa	He is just using you for sex, so find someone else to use for support.|`|cYuR3yIIaa	you're an ugly mess, and you need to get away from it. Seriously.|`|QuAHKe49aa	You need psychiatric help|`|fg7FXPAKaa	This is another bad relationship that you need to get out of.  He is not the friend you need to help you get over your relationship.  I think you definitely need to spend some time away from guys while you get over everything you have been through.|`|k5wDeKA5aa	forget both of them and heal and live your life and try to do things right the second time around|`|8Xud3vi8aa	this guy is obviously taking advantage of you!  thats really low 2 take advantage of some1 who just got out of an abusive relationship!    of course, i could be completely wrong (if i am, sorry if i offended u) but if you dont want 2 have sex go out 2 dinner w/ him or something, so u can talk 2 him and spend time 2gether w/o the sex|`|nE5GfCumaa	Then he is not a friend ? Like you said a sex partner is more like it... Get a good friend|`|5nlGD1Obaa	If he's not your boyfriend, or husband, then don't have sex.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Honey, you need to quit dating and having sex.You were abused for 3 1/2 yrs but you CHOSE to stay in it after the first 6 months.  Next, if you get pregnant, then what then?  He is NOT  friend if he is using you for sex, OR he does love you and you are using him period.  You are not seeing things clearly because your emotions are involved, you need to step back and look at yourself as if you were someone else looking at you.  If he is a good friend then he will WANT to listen to you and he will be patient and understanding.If he gets angry and dumps you, then he is not a friend at all.  Stop with the sex and work on the relationship.|`|c90d13c8565ee45f90365bb651ec0521aa	I don't think you should settle for being used just so you can spend time with him. It seems he's using you're low self esteem to get what he wants from you. If he's not then he'd be happy just to spend time with you.
ZyTZ9wDeaa	I usually find them hilarious and go along, but depending what it is. If its funny I laugh.|`|2GrlzDOxaa	It probablly isn't classy but you know half the time no matter how sick the joke, its funny. So just laugh! I grew up the only girl(other then my sis) out of 8 guys so i'm used to the perverted jokes and tend to crack some myself! If hey're funny-laugh! Even if youre like OMG! I dont want to listen or be in this convo just go along with it!|`|ZrpWpAOXaa	depends on what the joke is. sometimes i laugh a little and roll my eyes|`|Ga2dMpB7aa	Just react normally. Don't act the way you think you "should" just to follow some crazy rule of propriety. (Of course, in some situations, definitely act the way you think you "should"--just not this one.) If it's funny, laugh. If you're disgusted, act disgusted. Guys want to see you, not necessarily the perfect girl.
vYoyGziFaa	Scary and ugly are different. George Clooney with a mad glint in his eye and a chainsaw would be handsome and scary. Walter Matthau and a Shar Pei puppy would be ugly and heartwarming.
4drQ38qZaa	Blue, common but beautiful|`|90VbZc9yaa	green ftw |`|jMffH1kzaa	I think green is unique and beautiful!|`|M2JNgbI1aa	most guys fall for brown eyed girls|`|GoEdpprvaa	Nothing beats blue :]|`|zidR98rPaa	blue are the best mine are blue but green are also beautiful|`|J4hsuTzxaa	any of the above as long as there not red|`|grG9hxmeaa	Blue eyes are always my favorite.|`|grwLFw2Faa	brown is more normal|`|SolmxPz7aa	vibrant bright blue or dark chocolate brown.......absolutely the sexiest thing evvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvver|`|q5SJlFCNaa	they are all pretty|`|ktq7lF81aa	I like aqua (greenish-blue)    I don't mind pale-green though.    Not so much when they are the same colour as mine though (really dark brown), but that's not to say the girl isn't attractive at all.|`|Ks8aS4rNaa	blue:] actually any color, i think blue is a really pretty Colour. i have light blonde hair and bright blue eyes:] [[all natural]]|`|GDWHKzd5aa	hazel because well guys like brown blue and green well they usually cant pick so hazel has all of those colors.im hazel btw. lol.....|`|gaNn1kHAaa	brown eyes. brown hair. dair hair and eyes are lovely|`|osF09hCvaa	BLUUEEE!|`|k5qq9h85aa	i would go with either   a brightish blue or   a mix between blue and green

Since the cuter 1 is a jerk you know he has been a jerk to other gurls. Since the nice one isnt the cutest boy you ever saw he will probably be the 1 you should pick.

oFJ6SDpzaa	Why dont you just try asken em out? girls ask me out all the time. i dont think it matters if the boy or girl does it.|`|oKrNOazLaa	The best way would be to just ask a guy to go to hangout with you or some of your friends. If he says NO, then ask another guys out, if he says no b/c of something and seems like he would go out some other time then get another time. Good Luck, I hope I helped.|`|i5BQ8mT6aa	e|`|40qTdKuPaa	Ask him out your self. Who said the rule was that he had to ask you out??

69qn7muFaa	You know.. You can't determine love by time.   You determine love by feeling.   If you love him, then say it. Don't say it because you have to or because you think it's time to say it.   Say it with meaning, If you love him then it's worth saying. Right?|`|tznTwiGvaa	whatever feels right to you.|`|6WbJKTJAaa	Usually, yes it is. However, it's different for everyone. If you guys have known each other forever, and always cared for each other, it might be too early. It situations such as that it would be okay.  Other than that, less than a month is WAY too early to tell if you love someone, and it might scare him off.|`|hv5NjWT7aa	There is no too early to tell him. Just by all means don't tell him unless you absolutely mean it. Love is a powerful word. But if that is what you truly feel, then by all means. I just personally now how big of a mistake you can make using that word =(
edfRUVeSaa	well alot of it is personality and i know girls think guys are full of sh*t when they say that but too many its true. i like real down to earth girls that are still energetic, crazy and modest. i like when they're confident and goofy and quirky and cute but not self-obsessed and absorbed. as for physical traits. face is the first think i notice. i don't like the skinny long faces. i like girls with cute cheeks and a nice smile and capturing eyes. i also like girls around 5-4 5-9 and i LOVE curves. im not much into the skinny chicks but that my preference. hope that helped.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Her eyes and her smile.|`|blRAepCVaa	I am a girl and not bisexual or a lesbian but I would have to go with a girl who is funny,caring and intelligent and interesing.|`|xU8ovpD8aa	Body:  Cute face, I know its vague but thats about all I can say.  Everything body is secondary to that, but generally in shape and not totally flat.  Also I personally like short girls.     Personality: Happy and really kind.  I tend to date girls my friends say are almost "to nice"      Intelligence:  Smart, I never date anyone I wouldn't marry.   And I don't want stupid kids.
cDWHNcyoaa	lol nice question, the first time i saw his penis i just said oh ok lol that's mean but the truth.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	depends what you mean by not as expected  if you mean to small i dealt with it not very big myself  if you mean to big didn't let it in me to big  if you mean deformed haven't seen that one yet  if you mean uncircumcised that surprised me the first time but ended up dealing with it|`|xcF30urOaa	It was more than expected actually :)|`|ZVqOvtf4aa	ehhh
uP7EbTgbaa	when you are willing to give up your life for them, ya know youre in love.|`|bmLdmXWgaa	when they become the center of your world. their happiness is suddenly much more important than your own. they're on your mind literally all the time, sometimes the most consuming thought in your head, sometimes hovering in the background. you want to be with them as much as you possibly can, and when you're apart for a long time, it becomes almost unbearable.   and when they say, "i love you," the world is, if only for a moment, absolutely perfect.
c282b658121c083eb61a50380f3c922daa	Gather all your strength and tell him.  His friends will be a minor concern as of this time.|`|MhCKcCkjaa	I know EXACTLY what you mean! i was in this exact situation. if he likes someone else, dont push your self towards him. If he acts diffrently in front of your friends, do you really think hes the type of guy you want?   But i know how hard it is to get over a crush, so i would just be his friend. Try to always be there for him when he needs you. DO NOT act jealous, who likes that?   If hes not intrested then you'll get over him!
fP46meSmaa	It's not bad and you shouldn't feel bad,flirt with the guys you like**
keX3j4JLaa	What you need to talk about is hows school going, how grades going, do you have a job, does he like it or is a bad boss.    If that doesn't help you i would start talking about cheese what cheese does he like.|`|NsYIUu3caa	check what's going on in the news   nothing too tragic/ political/ religious.  those aren't good topics to discuss, unless he's a trial lawyer, politician, minister.
xlktQ8Y5aa	FFS.... Have some self respect and tell this guy to **** off|`|zvHYxpVCaa	yeah i think you should move on, he definitely doesnt like you....
JUEkTETAaa	if you feel he is ...then do what women do ....go through his stuff and find out
O394JLKLaa	Well its never good to have your friends fight. Trust me hon been there done that. Well, I think you should tell your friends that you really want to be friends with them both and tell them how you feel. And add that everyone does some crazy things ( such as controlling) but you still have friends even if you aren't perfect. And that'slife. And if they are still being like really bad don't talk to them and they will eventually come back to you. It will take a matter of time but try to ask both of your friends what the like best about that certain peron. All of you are friends and if they fight over something that dumb in life, they are going to be clueless in the real world. So lay down the law and pray for the best. Lots of luck    Massie B.
v0qm71o1aa	Go and act as if nothing happened.  Give it your best shot.|`|ThXq4vjgaa	GO. act like your having a heck of a time without him. but if your going to be bothered or worried.. maybe you shouldnt|`|oFJ6SDpzaa	I say go to the party. Have a good time! dont even worry about him. You deserve a good time. If he comes and talks to you just be calm
TCrV5hsyaa	Sounds to me like he wants you back, but first he wants to prove that he has changed, which is kind of "noble" I guess..
cUslVzhVaa	My Advice:   a) Tell her you are serious, and you really want her to trust you  b) Go rub her back, play with her hair, that always helps and makes girls feel better =)|`|egEucrghaa	if she thinkd you did it then tell the truth if you know you didn't do it then you didn't do it let her think what she thinks unless you have proof to prove her wrong.

AA10186366	I like the youtube idea! :D it's cute|`|as1g1g3Yaa	that youtube thing sounds pretty creative, and Yes! I think you should ask him!
HeJjK8slaa	I don't think that they're is anything wrong with being alone. I am alone a lot also. I am maybe starting a relationship after a long time, and it makes me a little nervous. So who cares what anyone else thinks? It's your life.|`|k2YrMIG9aa	No, it is not a bad thing. If people notice it you will quite often get sympathy from them, weather that's what your after or not.    And she meant that you like being alone, but in her eyes, she saw you as a person who doesn't have very many friends, and she more than likely was trying to be sympathetic.|`|M0EehbBEaa	That girl is a lunatic.  Or maybe she said that because she wanted you to join them.  Being alone is good sometimes.|`|fmHHcFd5aa	its not a bad thing. My sister was like that and i used to be. People think just because you like to be alone sometimes its bad because you have no friends and stuff. i like being alone sometimes. Theres nothing wrong with it. It gives you more time to focus on you and your thoughts and stuff.
eIOlBzm8aa	Yes that or gay.Model guy?|`|sJMFoJloaa	I don't find him that cute...and he does look somewhat of a Womanizer|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	yes he looks like a womanizer.... but wow, he is HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... his abs are steel. :) lol.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	you look like an old perverted man that will end up in jail or hell or something ig my prayer is not stronger than that. no not in jail, you are too cunning for that and sleazy in public|`|I3ugar6naa	definitely a womanizer.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	His mouth looks he just sucked some D-CK.

4WszPA0Paa	****  worst case scenario i would:  rap it up with a final email saying what i loved and hope will happen in the future...  compliment on the time spent and how amazing she is....etcetc how she made me a better man, how shes special... the good stuff    and maybe say something about serendipity or something... emotion would take over at the time so i cant be specific    leave my info like phone///address etc  then try to move on i guess...or travel the 3000 miles to reunite    this would only come from a feeling of love and such... other then that i'd just brush it off my shoulder, create a memory & repress it... maybe become a veg for a few days haha    sounds like a movie|`|hbanGS3Qaa	she is 3000 miles away  how many miles   3       no   30     no  300   no  3000 its done  get over it   better to have loved for 3nights  and lost then to have spent Rome alone|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	I will look for my next date!|`|Gz4vODGGaa	yeah she would cross my mind and i would cry                    jk        maybe i would try to find idk|`|ZcXQ4m0taa	whoa thats hard [f i was a guy lol]|`|3nh6WajCaa	If there was no way of me every seeing her again i would probably try to forget about her.

ClxJQmiUaa	hmm...well to a problem like this, there can be lots of reasons! They are probably jealous of you because you are beautiful/have a hot bf/make good grades/have an overall good life! I know the feeling...but don't let anyone discourage you or get to you...just believe in yourself and ignore the person being mean to you and sooner or later, they will most likely stop because you aren't reacting to their insults! Just remember that you are who you are and they are who they are too and they're just jealous! Just be yourself girl! :)    Hope I could help- Jen |`|sXpGfHWWaa	Because your a diva.. I have 6 bff and we are like a group.|`|thTmuy1Aaa	because you  let yourself be bullied|`|KtJELbPzaa	OBVIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Their jealous of yuh girl. Stand up for yourself.|`|qxIUcKx1aa	you have low self confidence u so need to join jrotc it really teaches you about outside of life and how Real people are. they have it in highschool jrotc is just teaching you and preparing you IF keyword IF you want to join the military after highschool after that they will try to build u a new character , switch cheerleader for rotc for a week and see IF you like IF DON"T you can always switch back to cheerleading
xmWxafHSaa	Did he say why he broke up with you.  It could be he thought he liked you as more then a friend but then realized he didn't, so he broke up with you.  He just feels comfortable around you.  Find some other guy to show attention to and see how he reacts.  Or ignore him and see if he comes "chasing" after you.|`|5e6S1JqWaa	i think that he might like you. if he only acts like this around you then there has to be something going on between you two...|`|GYJSuTXIaa	Well from what you explained it sure sounds like he likes you.  But I don't understand why he dumped you after one day of dating, that part doesn't make sense.    Otherwise, I'm pretty sure that he fancies you.
68e8f73113759339d7eb8f2b1b99cf50aa	Heyya :]     Right, hes telling you how strong he is to try and appear macho... they dont get it that we find it a little pathetic!    Im from England, so Im not to sure how old 7th Grade is, but if its anything like our Year 7, youre probably quite young. To be honest, hes probably best kept as a friend. Hes messed you around in the past, and to say you havent got enough experience in 7th Grade is rediculous- who does he think he is?!  He sounds a bit arrogant, and those people dont really lend themselves to being good boyfriends. He might like you, but to be honest, if hes not going to treat you nicely when youre together then its not worth it. You know best at the end of the day, but if you work as friends, why change that?  x|`|Kkjab85Maa	where  do u live sexy im in 9th grade i do the same thing with girls  he likes u trust me i like u to big deal|`|cZkQnEJFaa	He is just flirting with you , basically because he wants you and pro bally every girl to like him. This happens a lot and it is Nice to fantasize that the like you but it never works. He is a player|`|u3xzrJszaa	player|`|RnQFwIuUaa	I think he likes your company, but doesn't like your lack of experience.|`|pH1k2l58aa	your in 7th grade tho and u went all the way?....its better to wait till marriage then to do tht so young personally bt yes he mite like u bt i thnk he seems lik a player|`|RKId3WQxaa	YOUR IN 7TH GRADE TIME FOR SEX|`|y6vcfJ0paa	who knows       answer mine|`|2b17c80ce64ad216b8306152f28b338aaa	ur in 7th grade....too young...  guys r retarded at that age
as1g1g3Yaa	Ya and just make sure you dont use acually names or TOO good or a description.    I've always though about that. Your here, spilling about some girl you like, asking if you should ask her...and then she comes on, not knowing that the question is about HER, and she says you should...|`|Yq76jKOxaa	i dont i give soome questions 2 sum people i no 2 c if tehy can help me|`|XIJpOE5Paa	haha omg yess then i think maybe there on it to bahahaha.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	I live in Winnipeg I doubt it.|`|C5hEgseMaa	Yeeee, u never know, its a small world :p|`|7iMfRDNbaa	definitely!|`|FROfw46Yaa	Ha. I just posted a question yesterday, and I worried about that same thing. That's why I tried to be as generic as I could with some of it, just in case.|`|PcozPpA4aa	OH YEAH    i got so paranoid one time i even started asking him questions >_>;|`|wbJXqkVGaa	LOOOOOOOOOL...I know that for a fact:-P|`|I3ugar6naa	all the time, yo.|`|HeJjK8slaa	no, I don't care.
ZaQ6iQWMaa	I'm sorry you are getting a divorce, but any relationship at this point will be a rebound one. It might be fun for a bit, but you will feel lonely again if there is no real connection.  You are attractive, but don't worry about that stuff. Why don't you focus on your son? He needs you, especially if you guys are divorcing. It could also help with your loneliness - and you never know who you will meet just getting out and about with or without him.|`|0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	Sign up for continuing education courses, local gym, etc.  Being a male you will have an easier time of it.  Get out and make friends...    NightRan -  Wishing is not the same as working at it.  You will be alone later in life unless you get out and do something about it.  Join clubs, volunteer at the local animal shelter, etc.  There is someone for everyone..|`|21Wk2mu5aa	A 5 year old son every weekend and even some weekdays? How lucky and blessed you are! You won't have too much time to be lonely during those days!!    But when you son is with your ex-wife and you are feeling lonely, you can focus on yourself. You said that you let yourself go so spend time getting yourself back. Join a gym or go for walks or whatever you might enjoy and meet people doing.     Absolutely go out and have fun!!    You are young, attractive and you will find love again when you least expect it. In the meantime, go out and enjoy life. Raise your boy the best you can and absolutely get a puppy.     You might increase your intake of  Folic Acid, too.  It releases serotonin which is a feel good hormone.|`|8nGZV6ufaa	Make sure you keep busy and be around friends for a while at least.  You definitely need to be around people, and re-define who you are, are just for your own sanity...(I know, been there doing that).  I'm sorry your in this situation, and I wish you the very best.  Take care.  : )|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Oh hon, there IS life after divorce! My ex left me for someone else after 24 years. I spent a good year being ME, before I started to think about men again, and I learned to be self-sufficient. I learned to love me, which opened me to love someone else.    You are as attractive as you project yourself to be. Your confidence in yourself is what attracts others! Focus on being a great daddy, which will attract positive energy. That will set good things in motion for you...& I see much happiness for you!    I had a painful year after the divorce, but I have met and married the man I was MEANT for since then. Circumstances had to be in line...so never lose hope.  God Bless & Good Luck, hun. Someone has your back!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	First, you need to stop thinking of that other pasture as being bigger and greener. That's your first problem right there! From now own, imagine that other pasture as full of bull **** because it probaby is.     No, I don't think that you should try to date...yet. You're much too down on yourself for that right now. You need to focus on getting to know yourself as a whole person, not as someone who's suddenly divorced. You're in a rut, that's all....you have to break out of it first. So TV doesn't interest you right now - try reading, or something else. Video games (your son will probably appreciate that) or perhaps a sport of some kind, even just walking around your neighborhood. Also, let your kid drag you around for a day, take him wherever he wants to go, play ball with him, that kind of thing. Physical activity is a great cure for the blues, and you feel better about yourself as well.     Also, saying that you're not in your prime is...well, bull****. You're young, for pete's sake! Take advantage of that! From what I can tell you don't even look 25 anyway.|`|dbTPyM7Yaa	When you begin dating choose only those women you respect. Don't settle for "anyone who will have me." You will be very sorry if you do that. If you need to shape up to feel attractive, do it. It will make you feel confident, happy, and most importantly, healthy.    For now, until your divorce is final,  hang out with your friends, work out at the gym, take some leisure learning classes, but do not date. You need time to grieve the loss of your relationship completely before looking for a new one. Since you have a child with your ex-wife, always treat her with respect, especially when your son is around.    You will find a special person when the time is right.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	making new friends..going new places..trying new things..take up a hobby..a class at college..join a community group..a church..|`|HeJjK8slaa	when you know let me know, cause I am there and doing that.|`|SK7MxFTnaa	Do your best to get more time with your son if at all possible.    And turn your focus towords him...He needs it now the most.    Women respect a good single father...it shows them your responsible, and stable.   Good qualities to have if you want a relationship later.|`|qwCqhn61aa	Yes you can meet new Friends. But if I were you I'd look real hard at myself realize where I failed then apologize to my ex then move on.  I would do this so I wouldn't make the same mistakes with my new love.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	I wish I could find a new wife, who enjoys the same exact things as me.  Its really sucks, when you are not able to share your extreme super happiness in life in general with your spouse.|`|iD4ejChZaa	you are young & nice looking, you will certainly find a nice woman,  [preferably somebody with no kids who's problems will become yours]--try church, forget t.v. it's  too depressing, & do not watch the news!  good baptist churches have activities and get togethers for all people. Be around uplifting, Godly people.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	get your self out and about ,,, clubs , pubs , start the single life over again ,, or maybe in a chatt ,, {as they say there someone for every one. but u have to be in the right spot at the same time   good luck u are only young yet|`|nE95Hnn5aa	1st and foremost:  U were the bigger and greener pastures, she just wasn't wise enough to appreciate that fact.  (unless u committed adultery)     i can relate to your situation.  i have been divorced for over 6 months (wife DID commit adultery so I had to let her go to live her life the way she wanted...immorally)      let me tell u that it can sometimes be very difficult the grief, anger, depression and loneliness.  But, just hang in there and emmerse yourself in activities, things that u like to do.  realize now that it is all about you.  u have a young son, so spend quality time with him, truly appreciate what a blessing he is to u and always continue to teach him valuable life lessons.  great idea would be to join a gym and start working out.  set some goals for yourself like how much weight would u like to lose, how toned would u like to get, etc.  read a good book, associate with good friends, give of yourself to worthwhile things.  but, most importantly, for your heart to heal...forgive your wife, yourself and learn what YOU could have done differently in your marriage.    One day u will wake up, see yourself in great shape, look over and smile at your handsome son and realize that your heart doesn't hurt anymore when you think of your ex wife.  nothing will be there anymore.  that day will come, just be ready for it!|`|I2nYThQBaa	You need to get out and be around people but dont jump into anything right away and be careful there's alot of diseases out there.|`|wd909j8Maa	Def date but only when the divorce is final. If you're nervous or self conscious about it, try an online service first. I have some gorgeous friends and its worked for them!|`|AA11788494	A new relationship isn't the answer.  You are on the rebound and need a friend.|`|AA12102728	Loneliness is hard and so is the breakup of a relationship but don't give up. You are an attractive fellow and I am sure you have a lot of positive attributes many woman will find attractive. Ease yourself back into the dating game don't rush it. In the meantime call up friends and make plans to do things or join a club, something that interests you, sports or a book club or the gym. Don't sit at home feeling sorry for yourself. When you have your son take him out to the park, zoo, a museum etc it will be fun for both of you and its a good way to meet other parents, single and otherwise.  Time heals all wounds and if you keep active you will find before you know it things are better and then when you least expect it the a woman will pop into your life and who knows maybe she'll be the one! good Luck|`|SawySuLRaa	You should join something like a dance class. That way you can have fun and get in better shape. It would put you in an atmosphere where there are lots of different people and you can have lots of fun without actually dating.|`|AA11403695	move on with your life.  date, make friends just get out there.      no one is perfect.  We all change as we live our lif. Someone will love you for you as u r.
cei3Xnn3aa	just be yourself. it's that easy.|`|goP5E0Kxaa	Guys love it when a woman smiles at them, and is comfortable expressing herself to him, and presents herself to him. It makes him feel less stressed out, and less likely to mess up, and it makes it easier to approach you.|`|vH1P8U4Iaa	what ever life to short have fun|`|pfCXteHfaa	you might want to maybe talk to him and if your to shy and its not something you can do then SUCK IT UP and talk to him get your man before some other chick does|`|fqK8RG6vaa	when your near him "accidently" touch him like his hand or smoething  the way he reacts will tell yo abouthow he feels. if he doesnt like it he deosnt likeyou. if he loeaves it alone he likes you.    answer minie to plz at my profile|`|2bc2032db82e5489fa9c176d5b1930b7aa	first try to like walk by him and accidentally like hit is arm with urs and smile and apologize or something like that.|`|vygQIQYfaa	Just talk to him and smile a lot.

GoEdpprvaa	I think it's great that you guys are taking things slow. After he does finger you & give you oral you're gonna want more. So start out with a really good make out session & work your way into him giving you oral & then fingering. Don't think it through too much, just let your natural instincts kick in.  Have fuuun ; )|`|GDWHKzd5aa	ewww icky ........!!!!! u r f***ing GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|lQGDV7MEaa	Yeah, that's still sex, sis.  You know that anything that contains genitalia is some sort of sex. The former is what we call a fist **** and the latter is bj, which is also know as oral SEX.  Welcome to the wonderful world of life.|`|FkStpP7Paa	Go to www.wonderhowto.com and they will give u some good tips...One question why oral sex and not sex?|`|IFtKzGN0aa	just make out with him|`|YeR6R8Feaa	uhm well make sure his hands are clean, and his nails are short so you wont get scratched or an infection or anything if hes going to finger you i guess?? sorry, i dont have much experience myself, but i think that would be a good idea|`|UCq4Ap5Eaa	it will be finee..dont worry about it just go with the floww but word of advice the fingering might hurt a tiny bitt so if it does just tell him to stop..and no teeth for the other haha..
2qie5H3Kaa	stop saying mean thing to her!!!!!and you probly really like each other,you just dont know it yet|`|dCqsL9noaa	Do you say mean stuff to each other in an affectionate way? If you do, thats fine. If you say it actually to hurt each others feelings, that's not a good sign. Stop it, or if you can't, avoid each other.    Hope this helps
LIjpht1Jaa	probably not, because even though they tell you about themselves you don't know if they're "bringing the truth". there are a lot of types of people out their. if you don't mind ill stick with chatting with them and helping them answer questions from my house. it was really cool that you asked this question, i found it really interesting!|`|GKJEgidzaa	Eh, If i spoke to them enough, saw lots of photos etc, then yes.|`|AXsTB96Faa	yea sure, why not|`|32f48ab0216e5d9dd249d8e976b61a9caa	er maybe for some and maybe not for others|`|wgXke6QJaa	i being me would trust them . then if they abused me in any form i would block them tend this reason is because they want to wind up and if you react bad u are victim . none of us are victims we make mistakes so you know who is real or not as in life in general . but som e people find it hard to talk so abuse gets them noticed . sorry folk i am 42 so i can see it all angles dont know it all blimey wish i did , have 7yr old girl just trying to keep up thats all
ACoviJV5aa	dont practice on her... you dont want your first ever kiss to be with your sister, even if it is fake. you wont mess up or anything with your date... just do what feels right. you may be worrying about it now but itll all be fine.|`|ckZVn0KOaa	EWWWWWWWWWW    there are no ifs after saying "is it okay to kiss my sister" unless there is a NOT somewhere lodged in that sentence.. blech use the back of your hand like a normal person|`|Gslf19Uvaa	o geez O.o    so i get you don't wanna suck at it but trust me...im pretty sure kissing your sister will not help you.|`|bRoSGSxLaa	dear sir,  thats called incest.  thank you very much|`|VeDuDKKbaa	No way man, just type in google kissing tips or something. To tell you the truth I'd rather have my first kiss go horrible then to have it with my sister but I guess thats just me...|`|swOkwZNhaa	okay are you like into incest?|`|AkQ1loSXaa	what the ****? that's what cousins are for.|`|mjiACmnNaa	umm.. wow..   personlly i think that would be very awkward and weird no matter how much experience she has.
RnQFwIuUaa	It shouldn't be weird. If you like him, his height shouldn't play a part in it. Don't discriminate against him because of size. If he is a nice, cool guy, it shouldn't matter.|`|xP1HJnSbaa	Yea I think its kinda weird I'm used to the man being taller then the woman|`|EcIwl0tDaa	yes very weird|`|aKkDWz5Waa	no, how can u even doubt such a thing?  height has nothing to do with it! as for the eyes around u that make u uneasy with it they can go to hell. nd anyway, u said it urself he's the same height.|`|xETCO0rUaa	If he has bigger feet than you your fine if not adios!|`|YVVnFsJYaa	i'd feel weird if he was shorter than me, it's okay if the same height. but if i really like him, i wouldnt care.|`|lCBkTIwqaa	I been with my boyfriend for around 4 years. When i first got with him he was so short, he went up to my breast. Everybody use to make fun of me, but i didn't care cause i really liked him and i didn't think that should even matter. Now hes almost at my height im still a little taller.|`|ji1hBKT8aa	haha not really. There are plenty of amazing and dateable guys that are short (imo) unfortunately im 6' so for the dating world i guess its really looked down upon for me to date someone shorter.... but go for it!! same height is perfecto!!|`|FROfw46Yaa	I think it's a little weird seeing other people like that because we as a society are so used to seeing the man be taller than the woman. As long as you're both happy, though, that's the important thing.
AssYkVD8aa	That's the same way I feel about girls. Don't worry, you'll find one. Maybe there is one around, but you just seem to not notice him. I just recently learned that it may be that you are only attracted to the ones who are jerks. Try to pay attention to who you are attracted to. Have faith. Good luck.|`|UsqG6X6Baa	It depends on what type of "good guy"you're looking for and how you would define it.They're out there just keep looking.|`|dsiuzvTHaa	theirs one right here|`|OCXDnUWLaa	Just keep looking. Eventually your luck will change.

1hNrgfMCaa	i say tell her how you feel. becuz you will be stuck the rest of your life wondering WHAT IF. walk up to her and ask her if she could talk to you kinda in private without all her friends around. its none of the business anyways. the worst she could say is no. but honestly you will feel better once you get this out. and living the rest of your life wondering what coudlve been really sucks...so getthis out there. catch her alone and talk or pull her aside and talk. dont over do it though. if you walk up to a girl and say i am so in love with you and ive wanted this for along time, that seems like your not leaving her an option on what she should choose. tell her how you feel than tell then thank her for listening and walk off. u will have planted a seed in her regaurdless of her answer. alot of women understand the balls it takes for a guy to do this. so let her feel like she has an option...|`|vGHExDOzaa	do NOT under any conditions ask her over msn that is just chicken ask her in person and if she is surrounded by her friends write her a note asking her to meet up with you at a certain place/ time without any one else with her but not in the creepy way also if you told her something really offense she will totally hate you also do not follow her everywhere her friends and her will get a totally kick out it one more thing she is surrounded by her friends because one she is either told them what happened and they want to kill you two she is like the leader of the posse or three she feels insecure around certain people or maybe she has a lot of friends she is close to|`|vH1P8U4Iaa	its okay|`|fqK8RG6vaa	first man dont do it online thats a big nono for girls. teh best way to deal with ehr friends if u wana be alone is to get one of your friend to distract them whle you single her out. just tell ehr what you feel    soo er help plz answer mine to|`|apbuHIJOaa	My god, get off the computer and go ask her out already. You post this every friggin' day!     Do you think this girl's really going to want a guy who's as obsessed with her as you are?
hjt0H2MQaa	Why not do all three?
A6Yth8jHaa	if you feel that awkward around him, maybe trying hanging with him and your friends at one time, because your comfortable around your friends so it could break the ice.if he likes you back take an extra step and find some confidance in yourself, cause im sure youre great  you can do it!|`|JJMa25NWaa	If he likes you back, this shouldn't even be a question!  Of course you have a chance. Go for it!|`|fqK8RG6vaa	wow you just described my crush. she is so hard to talk to and i feel like you when it comes to her frankly.ihave 3 other gfs but i would give em all for her. you will be sitting there one day and a guythat u have dramed about will tal to you. if you canjust manage thewords wnaa hang out to him hes yurs    gl  hlp me at my profile first question plzz|`|aKkDWz5Waa	uh, i know what it's like. the unwanted, inevitable, nervousness kicks in nd takes control every time u sense his presence. nd it sucks cuz hes getting all the wrong ideas.    i think u do have a chance, but dnt let it get too late to let him know how u feel!! that u feel especially nervous around him means he is special to u, no matter what the scientists say :P    i personally had that experience. my obsession started over 4 years ago- i was nearly 13 nd felt like i didnt have a strong personality the way most ppl did so i tried to pretend i had one by ignoring him and trying to act mature and dignified- i didnt know better. then i started falling deeper nd i couldnt even look him in the eye anymore so i started ignoring him out of insecurity. now that its been four years i dnt jump suddenly or throw my pencilcase when i see him anymore but he will always have some sort of effect on me, but because of all the times iv SERIOUSLY messed up with him i feel its too late to have hope. i  know he felt these four years of playing pathetic games too.|`|D58bzW4Jaa	It is easier to talk to guys on the phone or over the internet instead of in person.    Try calling him or getting his myspace.
h6NqNzHAaa	Bonafide miracle, call the Vatican.|`|AA10395956	You only have one class with him, but if you think it's a miracle, then it is. But if it was a miracle in my books, most of the classes you would have with him.
LKqbrHNnaa	I know I'm not a man, but speaking on behalf of my male friends and boyfriend, they call those kinds of women 'Ropey'. It just means rough/gross/the opposite of classy.|`|5r6xSlbPaa	depends on what she is covering up with the make up or how bad her tan is.     but i will usually think that person is either easy or unattractive.|`|6L8AFxwdaa	"thats a hottie, but not girlfriend or lover material"  i mean theyre not "wifey" material.    im just guessing|`|GV8h48Wqaa	hooker|`|jDGF4cjlaa	hot..i do it
lb6jBcDiaa	he probably still likes you but hes trying to deny it because he does have a girlfriend  i bet what hes doing is that he ignores you because he knows if he gets to close again he might get hurt so he keeps his distant but its to hard for him sometimes and he just wants to see you so he gives in|`|9WU24ntgaa	sounds like he's not worth it girl. you can do better!!|`|XpxJmaKoaa	inore him|`|0gMBjOVXaa	guys don't have feelings after relationships, he probably is just making you think he is all innocent|`|ixHwF4apaa	ignore him. some thing wrong with him|`|VwG2lhcNaa	Why are you even wasting time talking to him. He's your ex, he has a gf, just move on, don't even remain friends with him.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	the problem lies with you.   you are gullible and unable to think for yourself.  most likely, you have low self esteem.  get a counselor and move forwards with your life instead of stagnating in yesterday's drama.|`|5e6S1JqWaa	i think that he might still want you. if he is acting like your friend when his new girlfriend is not around and acts like nothing when his girlfriend is around, then apparantley and doesnt want her to think that he still likes you.|`|ezlOFN4haa	it seems he hasn't gotten over you guys breaking up, thats why he wants to know where you're at all the time. the bad thing is he already has a girlfriend. you should talk to him and clarify that it's over, and that he doesn't have to worry about you.    but if he's still being a jerk, then cut ties with him.     hope everything works out!
LMmGYCzYaa	I am into girls who have a beautiful persona. Who have love for their families and friends and especially themselves. A girl is truly is beautiful inside and out, almost like an angel. One who loves is fun, hardworking, one who brightens up my day from just a hello. Ok well i said all this because i really like this girl and this is what i feel.|`|G3RnxAyyaa	I love shy boys!|`|AA12290249	for me.. i like a guy who works hard and is happy with himself and willing to help out. usually i like nice guys who are smart ha ha good taste in music, w/e ya know lol. i kind of get attracted to about anyone though ha ha. i do have this weird thing for red heads though.. ha ha.
yfPu5pcZaa	Mine wasn't a fairytale story. We liked each other for a while, my brother made me call him and ask him out. So he ended up coming over and my brother let us alone. Kinda weird for a while. Well, we talked about how we hadn't had out first kiss. Before he left he was walking away and I called him back for a hug and then he was like "well....what about that first kiss?" and that's when we kissed. We were 17.|`|tRAHbAL8aa	I haven't had mine yet.    I want it really bad though.. D:|`|1ZgV0AbGaa	not had one yet :(|`|PmVeQUdMaa	I havnt been kissed yet =/|`|9g2OAB8Maa	It was really sweet. We were having a snowball fight w/a bunch of friends, and then we by accident fell on eachother, and he kissed me.   Haha, and then I threw snow at him and ran away. Ohhh, good times..|`|r8CmwwNiaa	tent in friend's backyard|`|5qvIZCKXaa	still wishing it would happen.  if only i could find a guy.|`|ZvpIJrKNaa	(cough) hasn't happened yet  hahahaha|`|z5StcT1haa	Ahh i remeber it like yesterday....              wait a minute im 14 years old and never had a boyfriend!!!!!!  IT HASN'T HAPPEND|`|f7l9byFGaa	I was 11 and it was at a friend's house.  It was my first kiss and it was so sloppy I hated it.  Then when I got to be around 13 or 14 kisses got a whole lot better.|`|2ceqJRXDaa	i was at the movie theater, and there was nobody there because it was really late. I leaned over to my girl and kissed her for a LONG time. oh yeah.... I AM 12 YEARS OLD|`|qHDkCC2Caa	It was about six years ago, I was watching Edward Scissorhands wit my boyfriend. We had a blanket on top of us and when the movie was over we were both to scared to get up and turn on the lights. I went under the blanket cuz I was scared. He went under with me, and he kissed me! He kissed me a lot of times. And then I went straight to the bathroom to look at my new KISSED lips! :)|`|HKkbqlIuaa	I was head over heels for my best guy friend. He knew this, but said he didn't feel the same way. One night, we were hanging out, and he got drunk. He started kissing me and making out with me. The next day he realized he really had feelings for me. We are now engaged. =] (This is not actually my first kiss, just the first one that mattered) Literally, my first kiss was in the little tool shed in the back of my house with this guy Jeremy. =/ He was "teaching" me to kiss. ;)|`|jf1oPsSeaa	me and him were at a school sponsered skate party and my dad came to pick me up. he was across the building from us and he kissed me on the cheek to say goodbye. i looked at him and said "do i get one on the lips to go with that?"  he said "oh of course"  and so it happened. right when he did it, my bff walked up to tell me something then screamed "oh my god!!!!" at us and was really excited.  it was pretty memorable and really fun.|`|OrFYRg27aa	I gues you could say that mine is cliche but what the hell I'll tell it anyway. I'll shorten it by putting it in steps.  1) I went away to this camp and I met this guy I really liked. The first time I met him we really hit it off and we were flirting almost immediately. I really liked him but we were in different cabins and stuff so we hardly ever say eachother.  2) He got my number from a mutual friend of ours and we started texting each other back and forth every day for two weeks.  3) I finally got up the courage to tell him how I felt. I texted him saying... "Look, I know we haven't known each other for a very long time, but I really like you and I was wondering if you feel the same way?"  4) He answered saying, "I'm really sorry but when it comes down to it I really just don't like you that way, but I hope we can be friends?" I of course said yes and life went on.  5) We were at an all camp event and I saw him and went over to talk. Our usual greeting was a big hug and stuff so I went up to him and gave him a hug and he held on for what seemed like a really long time. He let go and things got really quiet. He looked straight into my eyes and said, "There's something I really need to say to you but I'm to nervous to say it face to face so I'll text you later."  6) I finally got his text last night and he was like, "You know how you told me you liked me?" I was like yeah why? He went on to say, "And you know how I said that I didn't feel the same way?" And I was like yeah, WHY?! "And he said I probably totally blew it but I lied."  7) It was the last day of camp and he asked me out. As we were saying goodbye, he leaned in and kissed me. It was the first time for both of us. I texted him on the bus home and said how was you're first kiss. He said "It was everything I ever hoped it would be." We were really long distance so we ended up breaking up but I'll never forget it!!  |`|UhNJbWsQaa	I was in kindergarten (way back in the 70's). I couldn't resist kissing this cute boy in class one day. I kissed him and he punched me. I learned in kindergarten you shouldn't kiss someone unless you know they want to kiss you too. :)|`|K7VAVgZXaa	my first kiss was better than i ever imagined and that person was the one to take my virginity and now me and him are going to get married on the 23rd of this March...and yours?|`|T4L5BN98aa	I was 8. my family was in chicago and thier neighbor was my age. we were going out for a few years.

That's when it happened, under the coffee table in my parent's living room.|`|LMmGYCzYaa	wow i have not had one yet. currently hoping for this one girl though!|`|Gxz28zY1aa	It accully happened a few months ago.  I was over at my girlfriends.  She was laying on top of me, kind of on the side.  (Before like two weeks ago i told her that I loved her, and she told me that she didn't love me back).  And she said that she had to tell me something.  But she wouldn't tell me.  I finally convenced her to tell me, and she said I love you.  And nothing happened.  So on purpose, i left my phone upstairs in her room.  So in like an hour when her parents were asleep, i opened the door and went upstairs and woke her up.  She stood up and then i gave her a big hug.  And i told her," I think i love you too."  So then it just kind of happened.  It was really great.|`|yoE8cd5aaa	my first kiss was with a boy named john he was my boyfriend for 3 weeks we went to tc that day with my mom and sisters it was fun and when we went to drop him off at his house he kissed me out side my moms car it was funny i had no shoes on and he had his head tilted to the side so he got my noes to that was my first and last kiss|`|tbwlQFNYaa	sadly i dont have one yet.|`|L88c0dU0aa	it was in 7th grade. my boyfriend knew that i was going to this birthday party and when i got there he was there he said he wanted to suprise me. there was like 20 people there and we were all outside and it was like 9 so it was dark and me and him weere talkin leanin against a fence under a tree and it was cold so we were all close and trying to warm each other up and we made out three times!!! so yeah my first three kisses were make out kisses. and i wasnt bad. lol|`|F8GUqsqiaa	Sadly I don't have one to tell you, I've haven't gotten my first kiss yet.|`|AA11151670	Never to old to remember first kiss.

So we kissed :]    Then we played spin the bottle and kissed a bunch more times. It was absolutely wonderful, haha.    I remember I had a cast, but he danced with me a little later. It was cute. :]|`|lb6jBcDiaa	:D   ok so it was christmas eve and we were under the porch light and we were just kind talking and we were both nervous as hell!!!!! so i really wanted him to kiss me but he was to nervous so i was like "i gotta go" so i kissed his cheek and walked off, but he grabbed my hand, pulled me in, and kissed me  haha
bnWFWCaVaa	my first relationship started in 8th grade and we went out for about 3 months but i lost interest because i though he was too clingy. but then we broke up for about two months and we both still really liked each other so we got back together and now we've been dating for two years since that second time getting together. and we're completely in love with each other.|`|AsOYbpjNaa	It wasn't even a "relationship." Just two friends that liked each other and decided to take it to the next level (calling themselves boyfriend and girlfriend). It lasted about 7 months, when we both just kinda moved on. To answer your question, boring!|`|oFJ6SDpzaa	Umm its was weird. It lasted about 6 months but all we really did was say " I love you" and hold hand and kiss. It was boring cause i didnt know much about girls and relationships back then.|`|r0D1fbG5aa	I was 13 and it was alright.. I mean he was 16...basically all we did was make out. we dated for like ever. and we still are dateing. its been 6 years now. and basically all we still do is makeout. each time we make out though he has a new way of kissing m e. he really is super sweet. he has asked me a few times to go further than just makeing out but he knows im not that type of girl. So we will just go in his room and make out for like 6 hours. THats all we do each day. we just make out, and make out, and makeout. I love him to death. But he doesn't have a job yet so he cant take me anywhere...and he hasn't got his liscense either...
bb11b229efe038c93cf16898769e4eafaa	you're definitely not a loser! maybe, you just don't feel like going out.    you're also not that unsociable because you do activities in the morning. as an advice, maybe you should try to go out every once in a while. If you discover that you really like staying at home more than going out with friends, then just stay in. But then, I must remind you that you might discover that hanging out with your friends, attending parties, going to movies may be fun for you.    However, there is nothing wrong with you! You like your home and you'd rather be in it, it is normal. I know a lot  of people who has the same feeling like you. Remember, you are not a loser!! always keep that in mind.|`|AA11330914	not confusing at all. i dont like going out either. people ask me what i do instead but its really none of their business. i stay home most nights unless im with my fiance. you're 13, why do u need to go out? i'm 16, i'm expected to party and be out every night. don't feel like a loser just because ur not doing what others expect from you. feel good you dont give in to peer pressure!
alxuJVsCaa	I wouldn't give a guy that already went out with me and he was the one that broke it off. He got a chance with you. And he ruined that. Move on.|`|u6EJnaVpaa	Get your tongue pierced|`|Dv9urjDAaa	Just remind him of EVERYTHING he loved about you.|`|Xu1LgjIBaa	MOVE ON.  NEVER go crawling back to the same guy.|`|0gMBjOVXaa	talk about the good old days when you used to date
vPkQpNQHaa	maybe they think of you as their little sister   or they have no one to pick on  tell them to get out of your face|`|nzbp17cTaa	slap them in front of whole school  then they wil realise
V20PTwMmaa	They are fine as hell and romantic. and Great in bed.  and fine as hell.|`|G3RnxAyyaa	Because exotic boys are the best!  ;]
CaEVHO32aa	at least 20... get engaged sure but hold off on the big commitment until then|`|81wvN8Rraa	25 + for women, 27+ for men.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	There is no "right" age to get married. It's different for everyone. Some people marry at 18 and remain togther for the rest of their lives...some people wait until they're 40 and divorce after a year. It all depends on the couple.|`|HeJjK8slaa	when you feel that your really ready. Marriage is a big step. I got married at 20 and then I realized that I wasn't ready.|`|79eBn6V8aa	I'd say between 25 and 30...younger and you won't have time to live it up with your friends...older and you'll become set in your ways|`|th7C1aoaaa	37|`|ZtfN4J6taa	You are not old enough if you have to ask !  There is no right age, you do it when you are damn ready to do it.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	what ever age that you both realize that marriage isnt easy and that it takes alot of hard work, understanding, compassion, and forgivness, then you are ready to marry.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	25  Younger than that, and you aren't fully yourself yet. And unless you have been together 2 years or more, add another 2 years on.    EDIT: I married at 19 the 1st time & it lasted 24 yrs. Don't ever get over-confident or smug...it can happen to YOU too.|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Im 23yrs old and got married at 22. I am myself. There is no age that's right for getting married. I know old people who got married at 19 and are still going strong. Don't let anyone tell you different. When you feel the time is right, Then do it
zGDyQfdYaa	Sit on it.    NOTE: Technically this isn't French kissing. Instead, think of it as more of an advanced skill for you to progress to at a later time|`|CHZd4HJmaa	Just swirl your tounge around i've never frenched anyone (im in 7th grade) but kids who have (sluts in my skool) say to do the ABC'S like make an A and a  B like that!  GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|9aEjKzKCaa	go with the flow:)|`|MHQVnqaXaa	nibble, not bite and yes use your tongue too.|`|I9dw8eWsaa	stick ur tounge out too!!|`|6L8AFxwdaa	it usually just comes to you naturally. ud partially suck on it anyways, but just dont bite it.... unless he likes that|`|VV4LlmxZaa	all of the above lol.
VrR9ojRRaa	Thats cool. Sure its not just mixed emotions? You might only "think" you like her?    i'd give it a few days to think about it and if ou feel the same speak to her. if she doesnt feel the same as you do then you know it cant go anywhere.|`|IlNDHC3raa	wow. that's hott
32f48ab0216e5d9dd249d8e976b61a9caa	the fact you don't know him should restrict you to just a card for now anything more would be over doing it because your like you said total strangers|`|mL07N3IAaa	yes you should! age doesn't matter when it comes to love!
RnQFwIuUaa	He really does like you. He is acting like a boy who can't get enough of you. Calm your stomach down and ask him if he wants to come over and watch a movie.|`|v0qm71o1aa	He likes you.
ySvWezDdaa	yes i think potentially there is someone for everyone out there, but not necessarily a "soulmate."   I think any given person could be perfectly happy with many different people, you just have to find one with whom you're compatible and stick with them.    as for this guy, from what you've described, he sounds like a jerk and yeah, listen to your friends and family, you do deserve better.  they just see more clearly because their vision is not clouded like yours is right now that you're still not over him.  give it time, go out, meet new people, and you WILL get over this guy and find someone better.  good luck!!! :)|`|RVzwViRyaa	not necessarily|`|xArlqHtraa	In my heart of hearts, I truly believe that there is someone for everyone, the only problem is finding that someone.     I think that if you and your ex are meant to be together, he needs time to grow up and become a better man for you first, or maybe you'll find someone better than him who will make you happier.|`|0fabfcfbe06b34a491d903e768e1f239aa	Yes I believe there is someone out there for you, don't settle for less, I was in a very bad relationship and with three kids and alone, I didn't think that there was anybody crazy enough to be with me and I did meet someone and got married and we are going on 10 years now.  So your answer is YES there is someone out there for you..... Good luck and take your time|`|tyN7119Eaa	yeah, believe me, i was OBSESSED and when i say obsessed i mean OBSESSED with a guy for years. He was constantly on my mind, i couldnt ever concentrate. do my work or anything, because i only thought of how much i liked him and how much i thought we were meant for each other, and how i would not be able to go through life without him. Basically, i was going throught the same thing. The only way you can get over him is you'll have to meet new guys. You will truly need to do this. Soon, you will find a new guy whom you see much better qualities in him and you will start wondering what it was about the other guy that you liked.Meeting new guys is the only way you can solve this problem. I feel like i wasted years, when i could've tried harder in school, and be living a more normal life. If he treats you badly and doesnt show interest, why bother? Would you want to live with a man that wasnt even interested in you before marriage? Maybe, if you truly still have feelings for him, maybe you should finally just tell him, that way you'll be able to move on faster. Either stay with him, or actually move on to another guy. Whatever you do- good luck with everything!|`|KATCMfLSaa	i am tottallyy goin thourght the same thingg .... i rly do think though that there is someone out there for everyone and maybe your not goin to find him now but i think everyone has their match somewhere   good luck  kelly|`|60HLAWDTaa	ans ur own ques.|`|rHTsKg3kaa	yes|`|cYjJhaH7aa	I think it depends on how long its been since the breakup? If it hasn't been too long, then its completely normal to think about him all the time, and think you'll never find someone else, but you really will over time.     I do believe that there is somebody for everybody. Somebody who is made just for you. And if you weren't happy with him deep down inside, then chances are he isn't the one for you. When you find that person, you'll know! It'll take time for your heart to heal right now, but once it does you'll be glad you waited for the right guy...hope this helps :)|`|aKkDWz5Waa	yes, the population of this planet is nearly 7 billion so just think how many of these ppl are guys who are more or less right for you!!    You cant let ur life revolve around ur ex nd you probably do deserve better, but u cant see things this way because ur intoxicated by him. he could murder nd it still wouldnt erase all ur feelings for him. i know. however, ud be surprised at how much easier another guy who comes along can make it for u to move on!! Get out there with ur friends nd just be open to having some fun nd possibly with a guy!!|`|565df5fe4c276dc3f59d54d1b9259380aa	I am single and wonder the same thing. Anybody want to chat?|`|uCyhALGMaa	Im going through almost the same thing..  and yes i do get that weird feeling that my ex is the only guy out there and as easy as it may sound when people tell me that i will get over him sooner or later i just don't see it happening..and sometimes i regret leaving him and i feel like talking to him telling him i need him and that he is the only one and what not..  but i think i still have a lot more to live and im pretty sure that you do as well..and just think that you alot more ahead of you and maybe just maybe you will find that perfect guy that you have been waiting for and one that your parents might just like..=]]  so yeah i think that there is someone out there for everyone..=]]|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Ok...I was married for 24 YEARS when he left me for another woman.  I got over him within a year, by remembering the bullshi* I took. And hon, we all take it.    I found my soulmate within a year, and am happier NOW than ever in those 24 yrs.  Good luck, and God bless.
bgE2gRwSaa	Cut off his hands and lips.|`|JJMa25NWaa	Be clear, but kind.|`|3Bfv6aUyaa	take the pole out of your anus and enjoy the fact that someone likes you, this may never happen again to you :)
odQewFgvaa	This isn't between you and his father. It is between him and his father.  If you really want to you could invite the dad over for dinner or  all meet him somewhere.  If he doesn't reciprocate, don't push it.  You should support his decision.    Crazy as it is your situation is almost exactly like my father and his mother (my grandmother) I only saw her once in 20 years. My mom flew her down and it went horrible. He was pretty ticked at my mom for interfering when he asked her not to.|`|nolxYfzUaa	There is really nothing that you can do except be supportive of your husband.  When he hurts comfort him.  It is his fathers loss.  Sad that parents can't grow up huh?|`|EMKuBql8aa	He has a toxic parent and sadly, the only way to get over it is to shut him out completely. It will take a long time until he is "over it" but he will feel better eventually.     Don't influence him. Just say you will support him. You don't want him to look back and feel bad thoughts towards you.     There is a book: Toxic Parents, that really helped me.  http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Toxic-P...
sXT86Swqaa	This is very common. Everyone goes through this so realize that you're not alone. Only time can heal a broken heart.    In the meantime you're going to have to keep yourself busy. Do projects around the house or watch movies. You just need to keep your mind occupied.|`|tr5lG02Xaa	go to the doctor and ask for a surgeon
cqcKhWI4aa	i think u should talk to him and ask him out, this happens normaly,  i mean he was staring at u and trying to get ur attention its enough   response from him to conclude that he like u, {life is a risk and the biggest risk is not taking one} , instead of u thinking at home and going  crazy talk him privetly , trust me its gonna be fine !  anne,|`|ZmRSmj52aa	IT WIll BE OK alright|`|c8N4fS6aaa	Just look at him|`|fe7C2Pnpaa	Sure go for it, ask him to hang out. You could try to myspace him to start up a convo. or when you see him alone go up and just be yourself.|`|0s190C7Zaa	No not really but good luck!|`|Tf19RETiaa	woah exact same situation im in, i was planning on asking him to hang out, when we were talking on myspace. good luck! just ask him!|`|JbGGwHhHaa	how old r u?|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	just go up and talk to him then just walk away|`|ig756kyCaa	Well if he likes you he will tell you. Try starting a conversation in class with him only during free time!  Also wear your cutest outfits and look at him too. Good luck!
58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Put a link to one of your pictures to check your face out. Honestly, he didn't sound very "male" saying that,
WrvWkIa7aa	I think he made the comments about dating you because he might have thought that you didn't have strong feelings like that towards him.He might like you but I can't really tell.From that info I would say yes/maybe he likes you as more than a friend.    Thanks for answering my question!
g4ufgo2Kaa	Hang out with her, talk to her. If I don't want to date her, then I, and most guys would try to avoid that person, unless she's a good friend.
E4iUcYEjaa	I'm sort of confused of your explanation of your story, but let me see if I get this right?  You're dating your best friend's ex-girlfriend?    If that's the case, then she probably is using you.  Depending on how much she liked him and who dumped who, she is most likely using you to get back at your best friend fro dumping her and/or to make him jealous.    Of course you can't ask her, that would be stupid because if she was, she would just deny it.  Your best friend probably doesn't care that you're dating her because he's the one who dumped her, but I believe the reason why she's dating you in the first place is to make him jealous OR possibly for rebound.    Either way, decide if you like her at all.  If you like her enough despite the possibilities I mentioned above, then continue to date her.  If you don't, then just break up with her and move on.  She'll probably end up hating both you and your best friend - but she'll get over it, you two are young.|`|l5WDTE9daa	Dude if your sure DUMP her. Anyway going out with your mates ex is never cool your basically taking his seconds.|`|p6zZqeuQaa	ask
sgrPLmR5aa	I consider it a joke, because I think half the people who actually do it don't answer honestly. But if you really want a kick and a good laugh then it's worth the $2|`|AA10395956	Don't believe in that stuff. They do it to make a quick profit. Besides, you'll know when you and someone else is compatible, even if it takes 1 girlfriend to 20. But if you want to for a couple good laughs. then go ahead.|`|bVJ0B7tXaa	lol. i did that thing last year.  and yes it was a joke but it was still fun.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I did that in high school.  It was interesting to pay the money and see the results, but I wouldn't have based who I'd go out with on those results.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	IFLURTZ JOIN THE FACEBOOK GROUP  it's not good at all hahahaha they try but it doesn't really work. it's really fun though buy it it's for fundraising!!|`|Bdo2GNA2aa	hah yah its just jokes but it is fun,  you should pay the $2|`|OQqAlHL8aa	I don't think they are to be taken too seriously. the questions are very superficial but it may be worth the laugh.|`|pUr5F3vAaa	Yeah, why not! It's only two dollars, and you haven't got anything to lose! :)|`|BL9CQgcAaa	Are you stupid or mentally retarded or missing something in your head, no body with a right mind will pay 2$ to some stupid test thats suppose to tell if your compatible what a waste of money!|`|bf3914759431a2f8053994ebecf71128aa	hey r u from jarvis ci  yeah that **** is worthless|`|ddd5e90dc2f2dc38c72f539c860caa68aa	I think its all just for laughs I wouldn't go by it for any reason. but its good for a laugh with friends
uKiIHxwUaa	leave if you have a place to go and have te money and now  how to take care of yourself ut even if you go its not like life would get better becus even how far you run problems keep showing up if you ask me the only thing you can do is pray to god and ask him what you should|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Nice poem. Make it shorter next time, even though I know you had a lot to say. If U can find another place to live that is more peaceful, then do so. You deserve to be treated with respect. Sometimes parents can't help situations they get themselves into either. They may be in a mental prison as much as you feel U R. I hope U can resolve this soon, and peacefully, so that U can finish school and have a good life.|`|xArlqHtraa	First of all, nice poem.     Is there a school social worker that you can talk to? A social worker should know what to do about your dad. He should not hit you. He should be in jail before he can hurt anyone else or take the abuse too far.     I think that you should leave when you get the chance. It's not healthy for you to stay there.     I really hope that your situation gets better. Good luck!
Rkt8tnUzaa	well if she asked you if you got annoyed then she must be thinking about it lolz.    i think you should ask her to see a movie or something, it couldn't hurt   and it could all work out in the end, you never do know :)    i think this quote goes exceptionally well for you, i know i like it a lot.     To love is to risk not being loved in return. To hope is to risk pain. To try is to risk failure, but risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.     well hope i could be of assistance even a tiny bit    & Gooood Luckkkk :D|`|AA12343985	Yep, sounds to me like she did and does like you.  She's probably just waiting for you to show that you like her as more than a friend.

hMavMBo4aa	Those are great!  I usually don't prefer DIY, but it looks very nice.  Suggestions: along with colored table cloth, I would maybe do a contrasting runner.  Or white table cloth with colored runner.  And maybe colored napkins, cloth or paper.|`|4KLoQYtyaa	Yeah it looks good except I agree with another poster, I don't care for the color of the candies with the colors of the flowers.|`|1KfbgBupaa	Lemon drops.|`|a3QNUrdfaa	LOVE it! Its a very classy design. The blue and yellow flower combo-*amazing* You did great if you came up w/this on ur own. And if u didnt u still get some credit cuz u picked it out. It looks beautiful. Im sure your big day will be great and congrats btw. Best Wishes :)|`|6BjZkRuYaa	eh, not crazy about the pastel candies/seashells next to a great arrangement, but I like simple....  I would do the arrangement w/ the tablecloths like you said and probably leave it at that....    whatever you do - its your day!  Im a firm believer in "to hell what everyone else thinks" for this one amazing day!  Have a great one.|`|ghLdIUz0aa	i think that it is very beautiful, its classy, and exquisite. i absolutely love it.|`|qfbDMVKKaa	Nice, very nice.  Have you thought about adding some yellow flower petals with the white around the candy dishes.    I love the Dollar Tree and thrift stores.  Very nice idea.    Congrats.|`|17c123a043ea813bbdbb18f16c4c2b58aa	i think it is beautiful and i appreciate your thriftyness! no one will ever guess what a good deal you got! and trust me, at the end of the wedding, you are gonna be happy that you didn't spend booku bucks on table decorations!     maybe, since you are taking out the shells you could get some of those glass stones (like what you would put in the bottom of a beta fish bowl) and scatter those around. the come in all different colors, i had pink and clear for my wedding. also, maybe floating candles might be good. candles are always a good choice!|`|M1CgQKiJaa	I think you have done a good job. I also did all of my decor. You should try getting printed ribbon as well as printed napkins the color of your decor. I think the decorations would look much better on a round table and with linens. There are places where linens are pretty cheap. I did my wedding on a budget of about 5000 dollars. It came out very elegant. I paid about $300.00 for the linens, 200 chairs and 30 round tables.    What I did for my center pieces were get a square vase, put sliced lemons in there, and then filled the vase with yellow and white floweres.     I think the mints look nice :)|`|FUEHshj4aa	i dont like those candies, it doesnt really match.  its all okay, but it kinda looks cheapy.|`|4POGapREaa	It's not my personal taste but I think what you did with the ribbon on the vases is really cute & imaginative & you're doing an amazing job with your budget.  The only thing I could see as a potential problem is that the flowers & vases are very small so on a long table they could just get lost in the mix instead of making a bold statement.  You might want to consider keeping what you have & then adding one large centerpiece in the middle.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I think that's all very pretty - I love blue and yellow together.  I wouldn't bother with the scattered shells, though. Anything like that just gets 'lost' on the tables once they are set with plates, cutlery, and glassware.|`|7CKipTZOaa	It looks nice I love that it expands over the entire table length

Uy8ntukjaa	There are two main reasons    1) Divorce is very frowned upon in Indian culture and family welfare is always put before an individual's welfare.    2) Marriage for love is still a relatively new concept to Indians, they believe that love is something that grows over time so marriage is more of a partnership. They don't look for their spouse to be a lover, best friend, etc.     Americans tend to focus on individual needs and often enter relationships with unrealistic expectations. The fact is loving someone isn't enough, marriages are hard work. Divorce is a very socially acceptable thing here as well, many people enter marriage with one foot out the door.|`|M8kNmWuAaa	Arranged marriages are because of religion and they respect their morals.|`|cX3yqEtVaa	Because divorce isnt easy in India.. and the woman gets thrown out of her family.|`|HJI8778baa	It's more taboo in Indian culture.|`|AA11593592	isn't it considered shameful to divorce out of an arranged marriage?|`|iy8C03vaaa	divorce is more accepted here...alot of things are accepted here that are not in india...THANK GOD...as americans we refuse to stay in a relationship that we are not happy in...im ok with the choice|`|00DBSvS6aa	In india the man waits till 35 to marry and here we do it on impulse, it would be better to have trial marriage|`|8fOLKcjdaa	Indian traditions are different from American culture.    Even if we get to choose our partners, we aren't usually as dedicated as Indians (who grow up being pressured into making a family).|`|0GnpLcjNaa	Divorce in India is a social stigma that will make your family disown you!  In the US, it's no big deal and therefore happens more often!|`|ddd5e90dc2f2dc38c72f539c860caa68aa	I think its considered a much worse thing to get divorced in India, it has sadly become the norm here. Instead of really working to work things out and to compromise on differences|`|xRhn8To8aa	In India, it is difficult for a woman to live without a husband. Also, the women are not as emotionally attached to the husbands and though not usually abusive, they would be afraid to leave the marriage.    In the USA, people can't just stay with one person and pick one person to love. It's sad, but us Americans are stupid.|`|elNfGEHgaa	cause woman know there place there BELLOW MEN  in the us we messed up an let them have rights|`|HUQMqdDqaa	Because marriages are still arranged and it is harder to get a divorce since women do not have the same freedoms as men. The US is more "liberated" and therefore a woman is not expected to stay in a marriage. Long and gone are the days were people stuck it out for the long haul. If things are not going well people are more apt to leave a marriage rather than work on it.|`|GwQevn2Gaa	Poor Indians just because their divorce rate is lower doesn't mean  they are happy.   You should feel lucky that you can divorce more  easily and you live in a free country.|`|81wvN8Rraa	B/c India couples are afraid of what their parents will say if they get a divorce or dare to marry for love not b/c they are told to.|`|fOYp0gGqaa	I always wondered if it had to do with the arranging as opposed to the choosing yourself.     Think of it this way. When we choose our own partners, we're more likely to get caught up in the whirlwind, the sex, the emotion, the 'high' and maybe make the wrong choice.     Arranged marriages are chosen for you by your family members who know you and your personality traits, and can see from an outsiders perspective which person matches your personality traits the best. It's like someone setting you up on a life long blind date!|`|tY4hOjqdaa	All these answers have merit. The root cause of divorce is that one or both parties to the marriage go into it not understanding what the true meaning of marriage is. Most should just be in a relationship and not get married. For those that understand the vows and the lifetime commitment, they should enter into it. The culuture in India does instill family values and that marriage is for better or worse, and a lifetime commitment. Here in the U.S. it is when I get tired of my partner go find a new one. Going back to the reason you should just stay in a relationship if you can't keep your end of the deal for the haul.|`|th7C1aoaaa	holy cow.....that's low. but i would guess because they don't know any better. they just tough  it out.|`|wbn4MGyHaa	in india the people are brought up and taught differently. the women are treated much differently and their jobs are naturally different than westerners. in westerners, women are exposed to more equality in genders and then the arrange marriage idea totally screws up with their morals and what society always taught them. in india, arrange marriage is implied.|`|xbISxnmfaa	I have been told my an Asian friend that its hard to get a divorce and its frowned upon.

Amnjqfk0aa	i say tell your two "good" friends about it, talk it through saying in the last while me and "her" haven't been getting along, we basically cant stand each other, make sure to state you DONT want them to choose sides, im not friends with all of my best friends friends, we still hang out we just don't usually talk and chat with each other. you are 20 years old, you should know whats right and just don't end up telling anyone off cause you will get it back. just be sensible and not catty.    or you could ask the girl for joined cusstidy XD|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	You are in a lose-lose situation.   You and your the "crew" need to talk together and figure this out. You seem to be the one with the problem, you can not expect the others to mimic your emotions. Just be nice and shut-up.
68e8f73113759339d7eb8f2b1b99cf50aa	I was in a similar situation last year... he came with a reputation, so automatically everyone thought he was going to do the dirty on me too. In actual fact, this wasnt the case, and he was really faithful. We arent together now, and I have an amazing new guy, but we are still the best of friends.     Give the poor boy a chance! Its between you two alone, so dont be influenced by other prying people. If you have a problem, go to him and get it straight, not listen to others. Go with your gut, and take a risk :] What have you got to lose? x|`|wc9FzOiwaa	If you haven't seen it with your own to eyes, or heard anything unusual (like him talking on the phone, emailing and hiding it) than don't dump him. Give him a chance. At least thats better said than done.|`|gnTg0rliaa	Wait, if he cheats then dump him. Most likely if he did cheat b4 he will again but who knows. Dont just dump him because of his past
YGYZd2FTaa	tell him straight up you aren't a little kid anymore and will no longer get treated as such. Tell him if he loves you he will treat you as you wish to be treated.

D9D8Ezybaa	agree, moneys worthless if u have no friends to share it with and have fun with|`|AA11931134	agree!|`|thTmuy1Aaa	money will come and go, but a true friend will stick by you|`|M0EehbBEaa	TRUE friends are much more valuable than mon ey. They will come with you anywhere, BE with you anywhere, for life. Money may go down the drain, but friends dont.     True friends are like diamonds, PRECIOUS AND RARE  False are like falling leaves, found everywhere|`|gUtNtO9Kaa	Thats whats up man. Money just causes greed and distorts your mind. True friends stick with you till the end, even if you dont have money :P|`|AA12225497	I definately disagree.    Now I could agree on certain circumstances.  As if to say "True" friends are more valuable than money of course, but just friends in general? No.    I'd rather have the money and learn to survive, but really money isn't valuable either, but in this case I'll take the money and run.|`|oSsVEXMxaa	I'll go against the grain and say that friends are a beautiful thing to have...but if you can't afford to fulfill your basic needs like food, shelter, and warmth, if you can't provide for your family, unless you have a rich friend who can pay the bills for you and put a roof over your head, money is significantly more useful.    Well, that's one situation. But if you're already financially stable and throwing away your friends in order to "get to the top," that's another issue entirely. :/|`|yDgxAHO9aa	I agree, social life is very important for one's survival, much more than money I think.    What do you think, did u keep that fortune in a safe place?

mzhFrm5Taa	I don't trust people at all, ever. I genuinely don't believe people are trustworthy, everybody I have ever trusted in my life has betrayed that trust.

Except my parents, and God.  I can honestly say that even friends are unworthy of your trust.

Please note that cute=/=hot/slutty/skanky/trashy.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	You lol. Talkative, sort of attractive at the least, not extremely shy basically thats it.

thTmuy1Aaa	try explaining to  them that yes,  you are  upset and  you  know it shows and you appreciate that they're trying to help you, but that  you really  feel like its something you need to handle on  your own.  its a better response than "  i dont want to talk about it"  because then  they know its nothing against  them personally. plus, acknowledging that something is indeed wrong lets them know that you're ok and are aware of  the change  in your attitude. just try not to be too harsh with them  because it sounds as if they really just care about you and are concerned and want you to  kn ow that they're  available if you  need them|`|eViOAQicaa	just tell them your fine and give them a smile.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Just tell them that you dnt really want to talk about it..just tell them that its something that you'd rather keep to yourself. Assure them that you will be alright and you're not havin a midlife crisis.. whenever your friends come around just bring up a subject so that they wont try and bother you about your problems!!!
s4iVl04raa	I'm sorry about your mom, I know that's probably really hard to go through. If your fiancee is pregnant with twins, she's probably not "done anything" to help you because she has a lot going on in her head and her own stress to worry about! You need to be there for each other, you with her and the pregnancy, and her with you and the epilepsy and mourning. My husband has something similar to epilepsy, and there really isn't anything I can do to help him. Maybe she doesn't know what you expect her to do?? Unless she is what is causing you to lose sleep, she probably feels like there is not much she can do about it except try to be understanding of your mood swings and bear it. Next time you feel like you're getting mad and you're about to yell, step away from the situation. Or explain to your fiance you don't want to fight, and change the subject. Take a chill pill, and take some time to yourself once in a while!|`|81wvN8Rraa	You can get counseling.|`|AA11198190	You have a few issues....  You need to talk to both your doctor and your future wife...  Realize that she is also having a hard time accepting your behavior.....|`|AA12272885	With your issues you need to get on a regular schedule, eat nutritious meals, go to bed at the same time each night (no one can live on 2 hours sleep weekly by the way), relax each day, and get some exercise.  Also, talk to your doctor to see if anti-anxiety medication is advisable.|`|odQewFgvaa	Stress!!! OMG. Have you talked to your fiance? Make sure she understands where you are coming from. She is there to support you. She loves you.  Each of those separately is very stressful. Combined.. wow.  You are going to get through this. Try not to react to everything, think before you speak.  Take a few seconds to cool down.      Good luck!|`|0d4X54rMaa	it's not her problem   it's yours!!!    you know.. i have many more.. and much worse excuses than the ones you gave to be mean and nasty and snap at people  but i dont    all you have to do is stop being mean and nasty  and start being nice  the end    you  and everyone else around you will enjoy you in the future|`|SzQi9N7daa	Its called stress!!!    Just let her know that your in shock and things need to come down a bit for you.  See your doctor this is normal stuff when confronted with so much at once.  Your not crazy just a bit overwhelmed....with time things will fall back into place.  Communicate, Communicate, Communicate!!     First thing is to take care of yourself........She should understand.|`|5f4c88c0a5c372fa2858b980a5e9f942aa	Wow you are going through a lot at once. Beside a lack of sleep, you are dealing with several emotions from grief from your mother's passing, your own feelings with your diagnosis, and the excitement/fears with your wife's pregnancy.      take a step back before you lose it and lash out on your wife. analyze why you are upset? anger is usually about other emotions such as fear, hurt, etc.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Join a gym, let some of the stress out, change your diet, and your sleeping will improve. Talk to a counsellor, you have so much going on at the moment its no surprise you are under stress. And you are still grieving about your mother, I really think you need to talk to someone.|`|M0EehbBEaa	Take a chill pill.  Firstly you really need to get some sleep, and a good diet. Tell your fiancee you love her. I know losing your mother is hard, but you cant take it out on your future wife    best of luck|`|LJDiSCCNaa	See a counselor. They can help you to cope with your emotions effectively and efficiently. They can also show you some strategies on time management and prioritization of your time. Involve your fiance, it is important you are both on the same page.|`|tbwlQFNYaa	probably becuase you are stressed and cranky. you need to get some sleep! maybe you have insomnia or something. just tell her she hasnt done anything wrong tell her you are stressed. hopefully she will understand.|`|MyzkHJLraa	You need to try to get some rest. If the dr. has given you meds to control your epiliepsy what you are describing could be side effects. You need to discuss this with your dr. you may also need to take something for depression.|`|cFrtOg45aa	You need to take a valium and put yourself in your fiancee shoes. Look the poor woman is carrying twins for freaking sake. Snap out of it. Go see a counselor and get yourself some professional help.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	when feeling calm and ok with everything, sit her down and explain what your going though. Give her a heads up. And explain to her that you are snapping because of the other things and life and ask her to help you deal with it.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	So you've had 3 major life changes in the past year, of course you're a little snappy! Find a way to relieve stress and maybe that will help. Lift weights, play music, enjoy a hobby, run, do whatever it takes to work all of that stress out of your system!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Oh, honey!  You are a powder keg waiting to explode!!  And she is pregnant with twins and has plenty on her own plate (epilepsy is hard, hard, hard on the one who loves the one with it--especially if she's been there during a seizure).  Also, epilepsy runs in families and she probably has her own concerns about this.    Make sure you are getting the right meds and talk to your doctor about all of this.  Neurologists are often trained psychiatrists or work closely with them and can handle other issues like yours.      Be loving and try to find things to appreciate about your fiancee.  PLUS, look around at people who have it worse--some of them will be in the waiting room at your neurologist's office.    I'm adding:  I have found with my son that a routine, especially at nighttime is imperative to keeping him (and me) stable.  Establish a nighttime routine now with your fiancee and make it a ground-rule.  For example, my son has the same bed-time every night and we do the same thing every night (prayer and/or reading).  I have a "no conflict after 8 pm" rule which I work hard to keep.  The same with breakfast, lunch and dinner--establish routines.|`|zy5qcc0Raa	try getting some more sleep. sleep can change your entire attitude. Sorry about your mom, but congrats about the fiance and kids. Be comforting and understanding. Being pregnant isn't easy and your mood swings may only irritate her more. Or try a stress reliever like listening to music, taking a walk, writing your feelings down, or just let loose and laugh for a while.
TCpWVW4Raa	You like football? That's good ;) By the looks of it you like a good bit of sport with that body.. haha sorry I hear so many pervy comments on this site and there I go one just slipped outta my mouth!    But back to the point, thats cool, maybe the ones that don't like it feel a bit challenged by a girl liking it and getting involved..like your touching their territory kind of thing? I know it sounds silly but you know what some people are like they can't handle it ahah|`|AA10395956	Depends on what type of men you're talking about. I wouldn't care if a women liked football and others shouldn't either. It's just a sport after all.|`|l5WDTE9daa	Nah its kinda good that your into football even tho im a guy i frigging hate the sport i think it total crap hehe|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Since you said match do you mean the futbol with the world cup or american football? If you mean american football and thats you in the pic then its really hot too bad I'll never meet you.|`|3an2RBWuaa	ehh its cool if shes into it.  But if shes one of those hardcore football fans who yells and gets all crazy, its a turn off.    People shouldnt yell at the tv or whatever during football unless they played it and got ran over a couple times.  Then you can relate.  Couch potatoes cant.|`|aCdya2qkaa	I think it would be interesting if she takes interest if she doesnt no problem, we can just watch the Weakest link together or Golden balls.lolz|`|32f48ab0216e5d9dd249d8e976b61a9caa	the guys that where disgusted most not have liked football its great to date a sporty chick and its an absolute turn on|`|VXQFT341aa	Not a turn off. I thinks its very cool. Besides you can like whatever you want. So avoid the wankers who say its disgusting. How childish is that?|`|syKIxX45aa	As I am not a football fan myself, it is not something I myself find attractive.|`|YLC8vHVlaa	yessssssss that's sweet|`|911f168b7fa0b89caa5732f8b9174286aa	nope.|`|DS33Wl4waa	Yes, love women who like football
gUscgmroaa	its not because its not good enough its because people are taking advantage of you|`|e4320d40393740e3b9148136c56004baaa	That's your own Perception.|`|qKOBIUrRaa	Anything you do will never meet the standards of over people. Don't worry about it as those people tend to be made up of armchair generals and people who wish to degrade you. People always seek to get the best out of someone especially if your in a special unit!|`|HOl6N45iaa	because people who can't do anything by themselves just take from people and they expect you to be perfect. I'm sorry to say that there are people in the world like this and you just have to be yourself and one day they will realize what an amazing person you are.|`|RATvWWIiaa	that's how my parents make me feel! after i while i realized that no matter how successful and how much of a good person i am it still will not be good enough. you just need to approve of yourself and thats the only thing that matters- dont change to try to make someone else approve of you more, do what makes you happy!

I mean really, you don't need to get your period every 28 days now do you? Or shave your legs or put on makeup, or do any of the junk we females do to impress you guys. So if I were you, I would just accept that you deserve to be annoyed every once in awhile. I mean really...|`|SsI4LLUZaa	Your generic question leaves more complicated interpretations.  Perhaps it is just you.|`|838VJJGvaa	Why are you guys so complicated?  The key here is communication.  Don't make your partner guess about how you feel.  Be open and share emotions and thoughts.  That should make relationships a little less confusing.|`|PcozPpA4aa	Girls are asking guys the same thing ):|`|UKP3DWokaa	we really arent...why do you think we are??|`|sCGWcJTFaa	Well I can tell you why, cause all you think about is their looks and don't even have a chance to get to know them. Girls aren't complicated at all.|`|310e9d2f840e1dbfb53942aa8a0d4b09aa	because men think with there ***** and sometimes there brain where a girl thinks with her heart..x|`|ddWyRjmVaa	Lots of hormones and emotions! lol|`|t0sDyzrdaa	cuz we cant make up our minds, are always confused, boycrazy, and very emotional... well, at least that is me|`|BhFY6gdxaa	I think we're pretty simple and easy to read...but maybe that's because i'm a girl. lol|`|E9ZLxgsOaa	It's just that time of the month young fellow.

EY0wnkh3aa	Omg that is so sad! Ya she obviously has no clue and i blame her mom or who ever didn't tell her. If my dad goes to jail for child rape then I would want to know. Well you shouldn't tell her because it's not your job, but she does have a right to know and it's sad to think she might not have any clue on what's going on with her dad. I don't really think there is much you can do unless you want to tell her which I don't think you want to. Just be nice to her and don't judge her because poor girl, wow I just feel really bad and I don't even know her. I mean come on 3 years in jail for not paying your taxes? How stupid can someone be?|`|t9c4vOZmaa	I'm sure they know the real reason he is in jail they are probably to embarrassed by it seriously. I went to high school with a girl we all were very close to. One day she came to school and got one of our friends and they went to the bathroom between classes and didn't show up to class. The next thing I am being told is my friend wasn't going to be at school for while. Turns out her dad was molesting her not only that sex and the whole nine yards for a long time. Her mom was always working she had no clue. We all never talked about it she knew everybody knew but nobody ever said a word. We all stayed her friend and went on with life. Sadly enough the laws are there to protect the sick who molest and rape more so than the victims.     Sounds to me that this family has real issues!|`|8oPVcYSyaa	Okay, get the newspaper slip it to her anonymously and then she'll know, u won't b in her business and she will silently b thanking u|`|DqJeSFWWaa	Ok if your not friends with this chick then you really have to need to tell her yourself.   But if you really want her to know. Somehow start talking about it when shes around to your friends, or get one of those newpaper and find a way to where she will see it|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Sweetie, she knows why her Dad was in jail. She knows. There is no way she could NOT know, unless she's deaf and illiterate. I know it seems like she couldn't possibly know why, because who could forgive someone for something like that?...But obviously she can forgive her Dad. Lots of girls do.     Frankly, I think she's not talking about the real reason he's been in jail because she doesn't want to talk about it...not because she's embarrassed. Also...I'm sorry, but it's none of your business. It's not everyone else's business, either. And I'm sorry again but this girl deserves her privacy, even if her Dad has to register as a sex offender...I personally wouldn't want everyone talking about what someone in my family did. And from the way things sound, the people around her already run their mouths a lot about it. Especially with all the media coverage - that can't be helped. I really think that you should talk to your friends and let everyone know that they need to give this girl some privacy. If she wants to talk about it, she will.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	this is a family issue that needs to be addressed by the family to handle and cope with..it is hard for teenager to have a parent in jail for sexual assault..he is now a registered sex offender
0bGDcN0Iaa	I don't think you are ugly, infact i think u r rather cute, and coming from me(a 15 year old guy with higherish standards) is pretty good. I think u are putting urself down because of ur boyfriend, which brings up the fact that u r still going out with a guy who calls u ugly, honestly u should break up with him for what he said because noone should be treated like that.  |`|7e4jxj3Daa	You're a real doll.|`|NwpGhT31aa	No!

If your bf thinks your ugly, leave him there is a guy out there that will appreciate you.|`|qZrIIThsaa	i dont think your ugly. if you bf doesnt like you the way you are. tell him that you dont like that. i just hope that you wear better stuff than those pajamas!!!!|`|oFJ6SDpzaa	i dont think your ugly, you just look real young to me|`|gMYVvjzgaa	ur BF thinks your ugly?  i'd dumppp him.|`|GVUWX1gQaa	WTF No you don't you looks like freakin Selena Gomez SHE'S PRETTY! and you look just like her!|`|7ZTlktMeaa	Ok, first off... Your bf couldn't possibly think you're ugly & if he told you that he's an asshole... excuse my french. You're FAR from ugly. But you shouldn't need anyone to tell you that, hunny. Look in the mirror.. But not for too long... Too long will make anyone feel ugly.. Trust me!!|`|4wTdQ01jaa	No, of course you're not! Actually, if I was a guy I'd TOTALLY be in to you... Why does your boyfriend think that you are ugly?! That's just wrong. Well, wear cute clothes that go with your hair and eyes, then everyone will relize that you are VERY pretty :)|`|xDVTGl3Caa	no your not! maybe a little make up and straighten or neatly girl your hair. you kind of look like selena gomez|`|68e8f73113759339d7eb8f2b1b99cf50aa	Sweetheart, you have a gorgeous face and such nice features and colouring. You are in no way ugly, promise.     And your boyfriend says what?! Hes clearly got issues, and doesnt deserve to have such a pretty lass. Tell him where to go! x|`|xFueK4ZFaa	me and my cousin think you look similar to selena gomez...I think its your hair! :D    YOUR CUTEEEE!!!!|`|AA11284982	youd look alot better when you become 21 lol. but no your not ugly.
RKId3WQxaa	that **** is way to long      thats what she said|`|aBqJhdufaa	Man, it's not a sin to date someone with a different God than you if you're Christian. I'm Catholic and I can a date a Muslim if I want. And you can't rely on video games, man. Take up music! It helps me all the time. Or trickin the f*** out of your notebooks when you're in school and sad.   And also you can email me if you want|`|ckZVn0KOaa	i seriously doubt god is punishing you or whatever... but what I do when I am feeling horribly down and angry and just feel like screaming "**** off" at the entire world, i blast some angry music, lock my door, close my window shades, peel off all my clothes & DANCE like no one is watching (which i am Truly hoping no one is doing..) but anyhoo the point is that by dancing in the nude you feel extremely liberated and free and COMPLETELY de-stressifies you..& i know stress.. TRUST me.       i know this sounds strange, but try it...i know you want tooooo =]|`|psKx7NF8aa	Get back out there and get your GAME on son!  It's hard to do when your heart has taken a beating, but that is all you can do.|`|DS33Wl4waa	Take a long vacation away from home, come back and have a new outlook on life|`|E14cuDlZaa	Wow man. That really is tough. I feel for you. I've never had this kind of problem, but when i feel depressed i work out. I go exercising. Are you on medication for your anxiety? That really helps me when i feel really low some days. You really have to talk to your girlfriend and tell her how you feel. Show her how this is all affecting your life in different ways.    To pass the time you could try and release your anger and fears. Try boxing! Always worked for me to beat the living crap out of a boxing bag. I found it really helps to pass time, you will forget about some things, and you will sleep better after a hard days work boxing. Give it a try.    Don't forget to talk to her, take medication (If needed) and try exercising or something. Better than playing Gears of War in some ways! Good Luck Man :D|`|jhegodFYaa	Well i like to hang myself with a rope and then pull another string that is connected to the trigger of a shotgun ( sawn off) and am always disappointed because it is never loaded|`|L0jeEhChaa	I think you know the answer to your question. You said you are Christian, go get your Bible and read. It always helps me. :)|`|LMmGYCzYaa	Ok i see you really are in love with her. But look you have to be strong and willing to change! it is not simply about thinking it is about doing. Think of it this way you are here crying and feeling like the worst while she is happily preparing to leave to Canada! come on man don't fall down to this level put your head up and breathe again. Honestly i do no think you should be with her since she is causing this much pain and is leaving. Look at yourself and feel strong do not say you don't want anybody else and do not say that it is gods punishment, unless your a bad person which i doubt,. Take it as god testing your strength where he gives you this painful, nonstop situation and is seeing how you manage. Do the right thing and be happy, strong, faithful. Tenga fe en dios y en usted mismo. Es tiempo de ser feliz no es de estar deprimido por alguna muchcha. Viva tu vida y tenga valor!|`|dd4c329c9b09ece1f1438e90bccd4b8faa	exercise....the more depressed, more exercise...releases feel good hormones|`|pMwxJNicaa	I would suggest that you talk to her about how you feel, but try not to overwhelm her. It will help her to understand whats going on with you, why you're avoiding her, and it will help to make you happier because it will let you dispel some of your bad feelings. Also, listening to good music, writing a story or journal, or some form of art or exercise can help to leave stress and sadness. I hope everything works out!!!
eE7Np0n6aa	BE VERY CAREFUL, she might be trying to charm her way into stealing your organs and selling it on the black market.|`|VSw6eN4Baa	She has a crush on you.    2 + 2 = 4    |`|cSB3H1y3aa	she's gonna have to remind you until you tell her yes or no------  hah,ur luckyy to have someone after you like that.lol.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	She likes you more than just a close friend.|`|p1TzNiSDaa	she likes you?|`|OS8TRe0Uaa	she deff likes you|`|MZPuDifYaa	Aweee she definitely has a crush on you :]|`|Ng4UNMV7aa	Hey, she likes you.

I think you know that it means something. It's kinda obvious.|`|ddkzojaDaa	She probably likes you. A lot. (Some of what you said rings obsession... o.o;)    If you don't like her back, though, let her down gently.|`|Drtoc0S2aa	she likes u man :)|`|8o46SYApaa	well obviously that she likes you...just  try a little flirting and see what happens!!!!!!
NwpGhT31aa	Aww. I think she is just shy, but she has a major crush on you! Major...
LZzsDARUaa	umm, maybe as he knows that he won't have a chance with u, he wants 2 show how is he like and just be good buddies ( cause boys will be boys), I think he is only joking around      or maybe he is trying 2 change ur mind about him    whatever it is, just have fun with him and taunt him back..:P, u can always say no again
XKYP0sGQaa	I've got a sister. She's 16. We don't have a good of a relationship as we used too but I wouldn't go as far as to say we don't get on. It is more a case of her refusing to acknowledge me unless she wants something. Even then she will end up shouting and swearing at me. I love her. It is her that has a problem with me. If she wanted to talk to me or spend some quality time with me, then I would be more then willing.|`|AA10142515	I have two sisters. I am very close with one, the other one is a snob and I do not much care for her. She does not like me because I have a better - friendlier - personality and she knows it.|`|F47MyGDSaa	I have two sisters (one older, 21, and one younger, 16). We usually get along fine. I live in a different state for college, but we often times talk on the phone. My sisters (the 21 & 16) don't get along much at all though.    Of course my sisters bother me sometimes, they're family, and that's always going to happen, you know?|`|AA12382198	Sounds like you're both still living at home which means you're probably still young.    As you get older a lot of siblings become friends as they get older.    I have 5 sisters and now we're each others best friend.|`|883c4qObaa	i do have..but i not get along with her|`|iOf7ze2gaa	yes she annoys me|`|19f5e6c60fba6ac553230548de86e0b1aa	your so rude im telling mom|`|AA10508837	That's quite true. My sister just became a   teenager and she's a pain in the bum.  Lol.|`|nY9CFcziaa	i have two sisters... they both bother me sometimes, but i'll always love them. you can't choose your family, so you should be happy w/ the one you have. some people aren't as fortunate...|`|WlwSQvE0aa	I have three older sisters. One is preppy/snobby, one is goth, and one is outgoing/goth. I'm the plain preppy one. The weird thing is my preppy/snobby and outgoing/goth sister get along, and my goth sister and I are exactly alike. My goth sister doesn't bother me, and she never gets angry at me. My preppy/snobby one barely gets angry at me, and my outgoing/goth sister gets angry at me easily. I am the youngest, and they sometimes get angry at me for little things. I know how you feel in some cases. Sometimes my preppy/snobby and outgoing/goth sisters yell at me at the same time! The my outgoing/goth sister will hit me, and then will pretend I hit her! I'm like, "WTF!" So yea.
FIcc1OREaa	No, but if they did I would think they were being totally rude and I would say something to them about it. Like, "You kept me on hold for 4 minutes so you could tell me you'd call me back? Okaaaayy..." They'll get the message and hopefully won't do it again.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	its very simple when this happens say call me when you get done and hang up or say if you don't click back in a minute im hanging up call me when your free
kkIVKvitaa	Whoa this guy is bipolar.  I would keep hanging out with him. Keep talking.  Eventually you guys will feel mmore comfortable with each other.  Maybe then he will think of you as a friend.  You could try introducing him to someone he doesnt know as your friend. See how he reacts.  But to me it just sounds like he is trying to make up for his reaction when you told him that you used to like him. Remember that boys your age are not as mature as you are.  Try not to seem dependent on his friendship or affection of whatever.  Boys usually dont want what is easy to get.  Sorry im not much help.  Good luck.|`|ZhUmY8b3aa	uhh  ur obviously friends  he asked u to sit with him in a theatre  and if you kiss em im telling ur mother|`|aBqJhdufaa	You shouldn't try to force anything. And he doesn't seem like a very good friend.... :(|`|pQBjqMkoaa	wow what a waste of my time|`|1XmpLRueaa	I think he likes you! He probably hung up because he thought that you did like him now.|`|jRUGj2fsaa	yeah you're definately friends. And it sounds like he might like you a bit too. He was just being immature when he stopped texting you. it takes a long time for boys to stop being immature :P|`|9Q6CkSMzaa	It depends on your definition of a friend... I would assume you are, by the way he is acting.    But, I would give it some time. Really, only time can tell. If he continues to act this way, then I'd say you two are definitely friends!    I hope this helps. ^.^|`|mKULeVN4aa	he likes u. when he ditched u nd ur friend at th mall its probly cuz he didnt like ur friend.|`|0zBbusFmaa	everyones my friend. dude me and my dudes are always high off our asses so we pretty much got along with everybody.|`|25DwuEYlaa	If  you are only 12 at this point,I'd say friends is it|`|alxuJVsCaa	Sounds like he's not interested. He just wants to be friends with you.|`|qZNdKQPmaa	he likes you.|`|WSCRgn8haa	I think you are too young to bog yourself with relationships. I would concentrate on studies.|`|Y0vkS6bKaa	He is not a friend nor an enemy, he is just a double faced fellow.|`|JqIhy7Pvaa	i really can see that u guys are still friends yet the only reason he hang up on u was because he was probably nervous at the time and did not have a clue on how to response he might like u if he talks to u frequently but don t tell him that you like him agian he will get scared and he probalbly likes he just wont admit it dont worry u guys r friends|`|IKwidHFpaa	Yes y'all still friends.|`|TW7Wz6Asaa	omgg!! girl, this is super interesting.  not to be noisy but please tell me what happens next. lol this is like a book.  anyways why would he hang up on you? ask him! well maybe dont. ha im not good at giving advice but i think that you should go for it maybe he regrets what he did and he wants to ask you out but he doesnt no how to approach you! hmm... :D     HOPE i helpeddd :] thankss dearr..    xooxoo,  sierra
AA10204048	you know what that's just one person. despite how you want to see it each individual woman and each individual man does not have to follow the stereotype for their sex. just cause the person is focused on money doesn't mean everyone else is too|`|nDQOwAA3aa	they want the money don't let them lie to you|`|UPN3zqq6aa	im confused over this xD|`|kNeKaZw2aa	Who cares what women think when it comes to relationships? They can't even tell themselves the truth most of the time, so how could they tell us? Just do you and stop caring what women think, if she likes you, she likes you and that's all you should care about.|`|GWS1gpZbaa	Seriously don't stereo type women you do realize that was 1 woman out of a billion. Some would go for guys with money and some wouldn't it's just like with guys you'd go for one girl with something you'd feel comfortable with and wouldn't go for her because the other has something you want more. It's different people with different personalities.|`|Y9YwtYa5aa	Its absolutely about the MONEY / security... and Im going to back up that statement up with facts.    In 1995 an independent journalist conducted a series of experiments over 5 years using dating sites. He produced 2 identically descriptive profiles with a different job description and picture on each. He then circulated these on various sites.     One was a fat ugly chap in a highly paid profession. The other was a male model / actor without a steady income. While the male model got the most profile views, it was rich guy number one who recieved the most contact & requests to meet from females on every site. I wish I could quote the link to the article but its long been lost from my bookmarks. I'd emplore any male to try this for themselves  on a dating site if they disagree. And any female to genderswap and pose as these two prospective males. The results speak for themselves.
OdTLUprzaa	Yeah it is definitely really tough to tell when guys say stuff like that!  But I'd say, with the situation you described, it doesn't really matter because he has a girlfriend.  If he's with another girl, he shouldn't try to be a player OR flirt with you sincerely. Think of how his girlfriend would feel if she knew about it... Just play it cool and if he wants to pursue something with you he should be single first!    But something you could do if it's really eating away at you is pick on him about the fact that he noticed that stuff about you.  Asking him, but making it out to seem like you're teasing him, could be a good way to see if he's really interested. Good luck :-)|`|5e6S1JqWaa	i think that he is trying to play you. he has a girl friend and is still trying to get you? i dont think so.|`|357267cc498a4aa4f253a992aae984a4aa	You said it in the first two lines, "flirty" and "has a girlfriend":  player!!|`|b7246aa9c54ecf3cf12beff32046d863aa	you haven't seen him before and he has a gf, then your firend might be true i guess. a honest and sincere guy wouldn't talk other girls behind his gf. he is probably player. listen your friend.|`|RpGH2zL8aa	omg i hate that!   i have the same problem!  is he sweet? or a misleading jerk?    ...the world may never know.|`|EmUhDWxZaa	ive already answered like 20,000 questions in 30 minutes so im kinda tired!!!all i can say iz dat if you don't like him then just stay away from him and ignore him!!!at diz point i dnt think dat i can tell wat he wantz!
xoXkHOVsaa	Sit down and talk with them calmly.  No yelling or arguing.  Tell them how responsible you are and that it is embarrassing for them to pre-screen your friends.    If you show maturity, you will have a much better chance of getting your way.|`|FzBk7OxBaa	i have the same problem. my mom doesnt let me to anything. its so annoying.   but how old are you? cus that could make a difference  just talk to them about it forever. they'll give in|`|IVGQhymCaa	Your mom isn't worried about embarrassing you! She's thinking about your safety there's a lot of parents that don't give a crap about there kids n before she sends you off into some strangers care she wants to know there ok for her own peace of mind! And even though you don't drink or antging teens are pretty much gunna make bad choices I'm speaking from experiance! N she doesn't want those choices to be in your face if she can help it! So sadly there's nothing you can do about it! But to assure her your not a drinker your not going to be that she taught you better then that n that the morals n values they have taught you go w when you walk out of there supervision|`|AA11330914	Hi. I'm sitting alone at a computer on a friday night too :]  My mom is pretty much the same only a bit more brutal i think. I'm 16 and i can't go to parties. If i go to a friends house, when she drops me off, she walks me to the door. while i'm there, i can't be anywhere but the livingroom, kitchen or bathroom. I'm engaged, but when my fiance is over, we can't even lay on the floor or couch and watch a movie together. i can't be out past 10. if i'm out with a friend from around my house, i have to be home by dark, which right now means 5. i can't be in a car with anyone except my family or people over the age of 21. when i have friends over we can't chill in my room, it has to be the livingroom where she can watch us. if my fiance is over, we have to sit with at least 3 inches of space between us and he isnt even allowed to put his arm around my shoulders.  little does she know i'm not a virgin, i drink, i smoked for two years, im moving out in the summer, im engaged, my fiance and i are having a baby next year, i ALWAYS spend the entire time im at his house in his room( and cuddling in his bed), a lot of the time his parents aren't home when i'm there, when he is here (we hide it) we makeout forever,and so much more..   basically all i do is rebel. there isn't much more you can do.   well, you  could talk to them and tell them how u feel about the situation. or tell ur mom she is way over protective. i did that once and my mom let me do w.e i wanted for a week.    i too have never done anything to break my parents trust... that they know of... but sometimes parents are just like this..  good luck :]
lb6jBcDiaa	yes! see what i would do is look all depressed when the guy told me. id get upset and everything and put my head in my hands and look down and if i see i have a clear shot... BAM id just shove my foot in his balls as hard as i possibly can and when he doubles over, id kick him in the side over and over again  :D done  oh and super sharp stileto boots of course|`|Fb11LZdOaa	Umm I could kick his *** from here to mexico >;l Guys who cheat are assholes and i\I'd kick him very hard|`|l0muvHB7aa	i would not only kick him in the balls, i wouldd kill him if it is possible|`|nBNzYDpLaa	Er, no.  I think the only reason a woman should ever hit a guy where it hurts is because she is:  being raped/assaulted  being abused  being robbed    Not because she's angry at her boyfriend.|`|7N2YPjkEaa	HHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLL... YAH!!!!!!|`|7lZwChrUaa	yes......cowboy boots........as hard as possible!|`|CfGTggdQaa	yes  deffo  like the sharpest stilettos you own  lol|`|xP1HJnSbaa	I hope not but I would never cheat so my balls will be..forever unkickable?|`|aUI5e9rtaa	Yea no once though.. maybe 3 times (:  -oh mean little me!  btw i'd so throw on some timberlands...  or pointy toe boots...  or even some construction steel toes!|`|WvzqudHOaa	if i guy cheated on me, i would effin screw him up.  there is no reason you should ever cheat on anyone!  if your unhappy with reletionships break up!!  haha, good question tho!|`|ItvJVKh2aa	Stillettos are stupid, cowgirl boots or platform tennies are the most devastating.  Boots chop em up, platforms flat crush them.  Both work quit well|`|7q9MN1Wkaa	I've NEVER hit a guy in the testicles out of anger or on purpose. I know how vulnerable and sensitive they are!    I HAVE squashed my boyfriend's balls into the bed with my knee by accident before. We were play-wrestling & I got on top of him. We were naked and he has quite large, low-hanging ones. I guess it was a matter of time before it happened!    He was curled-up, holding his nuts for a long time. I felt SO bad! I had to make it up to him BIG time!    But the worst injury I've witnessed was when I was mountain biking with brother. He slipped off his seat somehow & whacked his privates on the bar.    He was curled up on the ground for about 20 minutes, throwing up & choking. I thought he was going to die!    We found out later that he split one of his testicles! YEEOOWCH!!!!! I am SO glad I'm a female & will never have to feel that kind of pain! I've hit my own crotch on the bar before, but never had that kind of reaction or injury (just a good bruise between the legs!).    He had to have surgery, but everything turned out OK.
fI8AdrWeaa	just play it out and see what happens but don't worry cuz it might work out
3Sm1qQ1Taa	well personally i have a lot of guy friends, and a boyfriend, so at this moment in time, it's just like "oh hey! how are you?" and I'll hug them back.    if i was single, and the guy was a friend of mine, i wouldn't care, as long as it didn't creep me out. I'm open enough to talk to people when i have issues so I'd bring it up if i did.    hope that helps.|`|w2yh8Acraa	i would hug him back, and be mildly offended if he didnt try something.. id probably his him, or bite his neck (not enough to hurt).... ;)|`|AA11425983	hug him back...  and then probably be like....ok      lol|`|a3QNUrdfaa	well it depends on what kind of guy it is. if it was a perv guy id prob be freaked out. if it was just a friendly or flirty guy id be ok w.it. a little surprised probably. but i wouldnt freak out or anything. as long as i knew who it was who was hugging me|`|AvzMFmscaa	Uhm well if it was my friend i'd be like "Oh, hello.:)"  But my friends do that every day at school anyways...|`|xDVTGl3Caa	I would be happy if I was friends with him?  hahah
AA11909552	You're making this guy sound like he's a rock star or a Hollywood hottie that gets hits from every pretty girl around. I'm sure that is not the case. He is a guy, just like everyone else. You might be making a mountain out of a mole hill.  Try to think of him as someone you are already close to. Don't keep him high up on this pedestal you have him on. He probably doesn't deserve it. He just-might be more intimidated of YOU than you are of HIM.  I think it was a good thing that you told your best friend. You *are* best friends, right? So, why would she jeopardize your chances with him, unless she likes him better. Which is unlikely.  To get this guy to ask YOU out might be tougher than you asking him yourself. These *are* the 2000's, you know. Just be nice to him. Perhaps you could get him to help you with something. Guys *love* to fix things and if you're worthy, then he'll have fun helping you.  Just talk to him more. After a short time, I'm certain he would come to ask you out. Do not write the future that is not already written. He might actually like you just as much. You just don't' know it yet.
RKId3WQxaa	im not being mean. but this sh*t is way to long to rEaD
4BoteYDwaa	Just be straight forward, tell Jim that you like him and only him. That's all that really matters.|`|AA10046969	Let jim ask you out, if you ask him out then he will treat you like crap.|`|Z4TGcA9Jaa	go with Jim he obviously likes you and talked to his friend who is now competing for you he will leave you go for Jim|`|aDpp2w7haa	makae him want you.  parade around in your undies.

BqVs75xNaa	you remind me of someone I knew. someone I miss.  anyhow, onto your question.   muscle is a good thing, though if I'm with someone and I feel fear that I know that they can snap me like a twig instead of having the sense of feeling safe, that's my line. and I'm sure everyone's opinion differs on height, but tall works for me and can be quite a good thing. but I only speak for me of course.|`|vH1P8U4Iaa	i dont like to much muscle like you have abs i am yours
Lnp70Xm0aa	Big hands are a turn on for me, as long as the hands look feminine. How big are your hands actually? The same for the voice, as long as I can hear that you're a girl, that's OK for me. So, don't worry and be happy. You deserve it ;-D|`|yJTaBGoEaa	I;m not a guy, but if you think that is unattractive, I can see where you're coming from.

Just don't go all out! haha!|`|D9D8Ezybaa	no no no no no, dont get her to tell him, thats just dumb, tell him yourself and be yourself when u tell him / talk to him|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Tell him what you want to say. Obviously, if you don't know what you're going to say, don't bother in the first place. You shouldn't go around on the internet asking people what to say to him.|`|cd37yLuZaa	well dont act mean for one thing. tru to prove to him how nice you are|`|AREAqfSJaa	act sweet! and dont worry about what to say, just wing it :) just act sweet, say sweet things and be sweet!|`|Yg2iIneKaa	Do what mdoggs83 does. mack to him baby mack to him.

Listen to mdoggs baby you'll win ever time.|`|4DD8z5iGaa	hey! umm... i think that you should just show ur own feelings for him. he might like u too!(u'll never know!=D) u should just act natural around him and be urself!|`|v7a91KVXaa	You should act like you normally would, just not as mean.|`|cuSRcd8uaa	dont come on too strong  its kind a turn off   poems and stuff are good but wait till your a little more serious with him  be yourself and dont play game|`|IDVFsy5waa	Try not to tease him too much cause guys probably get a little annoyed. just be yourself! good luck!|`|LSrxN4Qnaa	yay! lets all be 5|`|Jusnu14oaa	i think you should be youre self|`|UTGDIOsOaa	i am going through the same problem i like someone too but i also don't know if they like me but i think that you should show your feelings to him and tell him how you really feel about him the worst he can say is no remember that. ive had the same problems throughout my life many people don't like me but when i ask someone out i get all nervous my friends can do it but if he says no you will find someone twice as better trust me.|`|B94G0Y7haa	well wait till he says something and then say something in response, just act sorry and kinda shy.   but really i don't think thats a good plan,its immature.   i think next time you act mean to him wait until he gets kinda sad by it. then say "im sorry, i didn't mean it, your actually really cool. i just act that way around guys i like, its not what im really like." then if he catches the hint (retard if he doesn't) just say "yeah, i do like you:)"  but its your choice, do w/e you want! its just my opinion:)|`|m84X38UYaa	are we 5?|`|FYFyQVZfaa	Hay is for horses.|`|0RmyNcMoaa	he probably wont come and talk to you, but if he does, he likes you, so flirt.  and smile.|`|IJa9diBiaa	Just stay calm and be yourself.|`|Tm3UshSvaa	I think that n Valentines day you shoukdl write him a letter saying that you like him! Then like say how you feel about him and then like say circle if you liek me bak and then at the bottom do plez return to and then say your name! Hope it Helps and Good Luck!|`|ajKczHOHaa	Well i think having a friend give him a letter for you, is so like 3rd grade.  i think you should just go up to him and tell him straight up that thats just how you act around a guy you like.    ..good luck. [:|`|qZrIIThsaa	nonononono. the guy is going to think that you can't ask him out yourself. you have to tell him. reciting a poem will be really hard in front of him... so you dont have to do that. but if you do go through with your plan... you should act casual. if he askes you if you like him. just say yes. :  "i'm sorry that i act kinda mean around you. but I get shy around guys i like" thats a turn on for a boy.    -=-----this works if you in middle school. mail me if you want more help|`|QEBB6QjAaa	Well obviously, he's not/didn't like that poem since you can't even spell "hey" it most likely didn't turn out well.So I would learn how to spell, then try AGAIN!|`|kMEG4tKVaa	well since he will know you like him flirt a little and see what he does.if he flirts back apologise again and then ask him out. you can say,"i am sorry if i came across as a totall b**** but thats how i deal with my feelings when i am nervous." and he will prob ask "why are you nervous?" then you say "because i am about to ask you to the movies." or something equally romantic. GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|sCyvT4G0aa	act natural. just say what comes out. the more experiences you have with this kind of thing, the better you will be at coming up with what to say without having to ask strangers. make some memories with this boy, and if he winds up being a jerk, which he probably will because he's a guy, slap him. and i'm serious about that. for one, he'll deserve it, and two, it will be a great story you can tell later.|`|Ggs8MC9gaa	just be yourself
TZkyrnlyaa	Hes trying to get your attention.  He wants to have sex with you.  If you truly like him you wouldn't care what your friends say.  Trust me I'm 15 too.

Problem solved.|`|rGnszJ1Raa	Well, he sounds like an immature ***. If he was a true player, he would be more enthralling, not an ***. He's probably a flirt, and by doing so is funny. But I know what you mean - a lot of my female friends think i like them (even though I have a gf), so that would leave me to believe that i am a flirt, and I make them laugh, so that's the only reason I came to the conclusion that I did. I hope it helps a little =)|`|da1Vqmbqaa	he might like u make a move and c|`|IDVFsy5waa	touching your leg? thats a little strange. I think he's trying to get your attention. haha idk just what i think|`|VTqzpqR1aa	he is a sex addict.|`|UHlvE2hpaa	he's touching u at places he shouldnt   u need to tell him to stop cause if u dont he'll think ur easy   and ull get hurt in the end and if he truly likes u then ignore ur friends cause the only thing that matters is u guys not them|`|cYNifeZTaa	This idiot at my school does the same thing to me in math class. If you really want him then just ignore him. Talk to him alot one day and completely shut him out the next. If he acts up just look the other way or even better you could talk to another guy (pref. one of his friends.)  Guys eat that stuff up. If he's a normal healthy teenage boy, You'll have him by the end of the week.   PS. DON'T LET HIM TOUCH YOU AT ALL! HE'LL THINK YOU'RE A SLUT AND IT WILL RUIN EVERYTHING. The key here is playing HARD to get, not easy pickup. Remember that and you'll succeed.  Good Luck|`|TDbYmIqzaa	This kid's got some raging hormones.    He's messing with you.

hU7faDq5aa	Yes, I am in a relationship.    And I have to be in a relationship because I genuinely love him. I was actually planning on staying single for a very long time and didn't want anything until I met this kid. He knocked the socks right off my feet! The chemistry is crazy, I feel so normal and ok around him, If that makes sense lol. Like idk, I always do feel that energy when I'm around him.     Hope this answered your question :)|`|JJMa25NWaa	Yes, I'm in a relationship.  No, I'm not in love, but there is definite chemistry. I'm just giving him a chance, I really like him, but I do know the difference between like and love.|`|AA11886795	I don't know how to answer this question.. I love my boyfriend but then i am scared to be single also.. When we first started dating we had a lot of chemistry after 2 years it started dieing slowing...

Thn she appolized again n now iam done. i put soo much effort into r friend ship. i play soccer all year on a high level team n i always made time for her n when she couldnt do it to me it hurt a lot. I no it hurts sooo much, that you just wanna cry and its ok things will get better it has to...i hope lol. i just look at it as its better now to find out who has ur back thn later. n i found out whos my real friends so something goood did come out of this. but i no it sucks but be strong and goood luck!!!!!!|`|RATvWWIiaa	o yes several times. my "best friend" michael once made a screen name on AIM that was like gina with a bunch of numbers and talked to people, including my friends, pretending to be me. then one of my close friends talked to her other friend behind my back about how she thinks im sooo ugly and look like a rat. hmm oh and a couple yrs ago i went through a really nasty breakup with a guy i'd been with for a year, and he started getting extremely nasty to me, and this girl i'd been friends with since like 2nd grade was all sympathetic with  me saying he should be arrested and was crazy and all this stuff, then i found out she had secretly been messaging him on Myspace behind my back apologizing and trying to get to know him. she didnt even know him! actually she had a habit of trying to get guys that i liked to like her. so yea ive been betrayed by friends many times, i just stopped talking to them, the first two i made amends with but i still dont like them very much, and for the third that was the final straw.
nd4QSsr1aa	marriage looks better from the outside looking in- no question about that-   women do the cooking, the cleaning, caring for the kids, making appointments for the family planning for any events, preps for visits from family and that lump on the couch we call a husband just watches and does nothing- his reasoning- he has to work all week-  do they not see what we do all week?   well here i go on a rant- but yes technically we are Dogs.|`|WlnnsGM5aa	It is.

3vCXBRBgaa	i dont blame you for feeling the way you are feeling. ive been through it and it caused me to get it somewhere else. look everyone has needs, and your relationship is lacking a big need. i know it seems messed up but you got to get it somewhere else if shes not giving it to  you.     even though i understand your reason to get it somewhere else, just remember one thing, more than likely you arent going to tell your wife that you are having sex with someone else. the first couple of times you have sex with this other woman, trust me, after its all done, both of you are going to feel like crap. when you look at your wife when you get home its not going to feel to good. sorry man, it comes with the territory. you have to look at it from every angle.|`|cDubFtwlaa	cheat these hissy fit woman are feminists sexist and dont give 4 fucks 2 shits or a flying **** about us men and our needs yet they will become bar whores the very minute there men don put out **** these hypocrits and do what non biased/feminist/sexist people say    sry for my rant|`|QSodlfMraa	would you want some other man doing your wife? no! leave the man wife or girl alone, if the chick you want to cheaton your wife is single then go a head.|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	You dont want to leave your wife but your already willing to cheat on her because you cant get it at home. well I am sure once your wife finds out that you are doing this she WILL LEAVE you anyway.   Maybe there is a reason she isnt willing. have you thought about that? Talk to her more about the problem before your entire marriage goes up in smoke. Trust me you wont make your wife happy by not asking her for some you will only make her angry and want to leave you.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Having sex is a completely natural urge. Cheat discreetly, have incredible sex and live life!|`|t81MEJ82aa	I say go for it, but do not make the mistake of communicating with this woman for anything more than sex or spending more time with her than you should, you will get caught. Most women notice the slightest changes in our behavior so she'll think something is going on if you do not bother her for sex anymore. I do not believe it is reasonable to expect to get 100% of everything you need from one human being. None of us are perfect. These women throwing a hissy fit live in fantasy land where men aren't supposed to have needs, and only women need tending too.|`|AA12272885	If your wife cares about the relationship she will make concessions in order to please you, and so will you.  There are many ways to satisfy each other.  If she just refuses, and you want to stay, then you have to discuss with your wife that you are considering a physical affair to get the sex you need.  If she agrees to your idea, then go for it, just use protection.  (Of course we know you aren't about to do that are you?  That is why you are here, hoping to find support or validation of your desire to cheat.)|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Okay...you're not going to like this, but hopefully you'll be man enough to take it....    You need to understand this fact: She does NOT have "sexual selfishness". You're the one with that, homie. Do you actually think that she lies in bed, laughing to herself about withholding sex from you? She doesn't. She can't help that she can't get in the mood and I'm certain that she wishes things were different. You've never experienced it and you never will, but menopause is hormonal hell and yes, sadly it does last for a long time. I mean...how would you like it if you were having erectile disfunction and she called you selfish?? Do you honestly think that she owes it to you to have sex with you even though she's not in the mood? Or is it that you think that she should just hit a switch and turn herself on automatically?    ETA: You've put your wife through tests to make sure SHE wasn't cheating, and yet here you are looking to us to validate your desire to do the very thing you don't want her to do? You, sir, are a filthy hypocrite.|`|AARZV2v0aa	WTF!!!! SERIOUSLY! YOU PUT HER THOUGH TESTS! WHERE IS THE TRUST! WITHOUT IT A RELATIONSHIP WILL FAIL.!! AND DONT CHEAT WHATS WRONG WITH YOU!

YOU JERK!|`|iD4ejChZaa	if you really love your wife you will not commit adultery, no matter how you blabber on & on.|`|81wvN8Rraa	If you aren't going to leave then cheat and hope when your wife finds out she doesn't leave.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	You need to put the breaks on here. First, have you investigated the true root cause of your wife's low sex drive? There could be natural supplements she could take to reverse that or other Meds from her Dr. to help change the condition. Exercise is also another thing that will increase ones sex drive. Also, you need to sit down with your wife and communicate your desires and her lack thereof. Before you opt to farm out the sexual component of your marriage, you need to  thoroughly exhaust the options that have not been invoked yet.|`|0d4X54rMaa	your wife might be having some hormonal problems  before you think about anything have her go to her dr and check  there are pills she can take|`|o1yy6KABaa	I think that the only way you can do this is by telling your wife exactly what you have said on here and how far the lack of sex has gotten too... if you really have tried talking to your wife and if the only problem is that you arent sexually compatible then she has every right to know just how frustrated you are.    yes it is still wrong if you cheat on her, cheating is cheating, theres no going around it and there is no taking it back.|`|AA11198190	You just that you won't be leaving your wife....  Well if you cheat ...she probably will leave you.  She may be going through menopause...and may seem distant ....but the feelings she has for you would be surrounded with love.  She is just not into sex...right now.lt is no doubt is a hormone imbalance.Make her feel loved,but don't constantly push her for sex.  Maybe you need to discuss other avenues,foreplay,or maybe you will just have to literally entertain yourself for a time.........|`|B1sT1t44aa	It looks like you have already made up your mind to cheat on your wife so what do you want from all of us here?|`|hcgaizJCaa	"Should i tie my tubes because she has sexual selfishness or should i see my friend on the outside to make myself happy and make my wife happy by not having to bother her for sex"    You don't have tubes, let's get that straight right off the bat.    You are also kind of a jerk. Sexual selfishness? Do you know anything about menopause? Have you ever gone thru it? Well, neither have i, but i've read about it and it's extremely common for libidos to plummet during it. On the plus side, once the change is complete, they do tend to rise again.    How incredibly unfortunate for your wife to be married to a man who has no sympathy for her at all. An "outside courtship" will not make it perfect. Her being married to someone else would make it perfect.|`|00DBSvS6aa	Sex is necessary for life and good health as well as psychological balance and no you shouldn't leave your wife. The menopause will eventually change and she will have desires again but in the meantime discreet solutions are the best answer.|`|79eBn6V8aa	do it, but be prepared to feel some guilt afterward.

If you choose to cheat your just asking for BAD Karma and eventually it will catch up to you and bite you in the a**. What will you do then?

Im sorry but if you love her then you work this out somehow not go elsewhere.|`|U12fsjPKaa	before reading this ...i thought i my boyfriend was a real jerk... but no you r the biggest jerk ! men like you don't deserve to have a nice women ...karma is b**ch and if u do cheat on her man you might get something u don't want !!!!! so rethink ur action do you really wanna risk someone you love on someone who is just a piece of a**   and for the rest of the men who are rooting him on you are pathetic!|`|SzQi9N7daa	No such thing as I love my wife but I'm gunna cheat.  Ya want more sex, masturbate!  Cheating is wrong period.  No this courtship will not make it good again. Stop trying to justify it like some medicinal purpose.  You wont die without it and your junk wont fall off or explode from lack of use. The fact that she allows sex during her cycle could mean that she finds it painfully dry during other times. I don't think you've "discussed" it as much as you say more like laid out an ultimatum.  Yes her drive is low and there are therapy's for that if she chooses. Until you discuss it further and understand things from her perspective (and during this time she might not even understand it) then grab a magazine and head to the bathroom.  That's how you'll save this marriage.|`|ZtfN4J6taa	I say go for it !

If she's tickling you in an indecent way, that's going pretty far.  Socialize with her together with a bunch of your other friends, but don't get into the twosome scene yet, if she's going to be that bold.|`|tRAHbAL8aa	She likes you.    But she seems like a wh0re!

My husband. :)|`|IfwpibHqaa	BRAD PITT HIS JUST COOL mmmmmmmmmmmm|`|UPN3zqq6aa	omg just like gerard way hes soo hawt, lyn-z is so lucky to be with him lol xD|`|a3QNUrdfaa	a hot guy to me  LOOKS: tall, solidly built -not a string bean but not real big either- great eyes, a nice smile, good hair  PERSONALITY: trustworthy, one who has a way of making you feel like you're the only one in the world, one who'll do random things w/me and be crazy w/me, one who doesnt care about his personal appearance too much (not slovenly of course, but not lookin like hes gonna step out of GQ either) a hard worker, good listener....all this and more makes a guy so hot and irresistable to me. (a hot guy working on cars...covered in grease...mmmmmmm)|`|8NqQvOqQaa	brown eyes  brown hair  tall  skinny   nice voice  amazing personality    i'm basically describing david tennant  sorry  LOL|`|vpvZ6Dwcaa	a hot guy   -has a nice body  -nice hair   -cute smile  -dresses nice    and he acts   -nice   -flirtatious   -really funny  -somewhat sarcastic   -somewhat shy  -somewhat clingy  -|`|5Mlg11zmaa	hello!!    most importantly, the guy should be confident and happy with himself!   he should be confident (and i find a tough of cockiness attractive) but definately not arrogant.  he should DEFINATELY act the same with me when we are alone as to when his mates are there too (not all cold and ignoring me)  sense of humour is vital for most girls, and generally optimistic and good fun to be around....no girl wants to be with a guy who moans all the time, or is constantly complaining or even someone who is constantly judging or mocking others  also, you can judge a person by their friends, so if a guy hangs around with a nice crowd, they are intsantly more appealing!  no drugs!!!!    looks wise..i am attracted to guys with nice eyes, dark hair, good hairstyle but not over worked. clear skin, nice smile. kissable lips.  good body (not lanky) but also no overworked like a gym freak (six packs are a turn off!)  he must have decent feet too! haha    hope this helps!!        most importantly.....BE YOURSELF! dont try to be someone your not, cos you cant keep it up forever, and you will look and feel like an idiot!      good luck babe!
l5WDTE9daa	Well im a guy im 17 and to be honest i don't think that i would ever cheat on a girl. I mean all ive had up till now is just flings with girls nothing intimate. I do believe girls are very harsh on guys lately. To be honest i think im pretty good looking and your probally finding the guys who like to just sleep with anythign and everything and are complete sex driven maniacs. You need to find a ''hot'' guy who hasn't been wiht loads of girls.x|`|eIzv9Lwwaa	most hot guys are conceited. the few that aren't are always taken. i met one and we keep in touch. the thing is most of those hot guys can have any girl they want and they do just that. they have so much confidence and they just mostly cheat. i had an ex like that. some are cool but just friend material.|`|lzZDTM9saa	cuz hot guys are, FOR THE MOST PART, conceited.    not all are, but most.  they're used to ppl going crazy over them, so they use it to their advantage as much as possible, which turns them into the cheating jerks most of them are.|`|aCdya2qkaa	HEYY! is somebody talking about me, behind my back.lolz. jokes.|`|bPd7llYuaa	well i don't mean to generalize but the majority of my hot guy friends are man w hores but there are one or two that are really nice and smart.|`|AA11425983	I don't generalize...but sadly...that's the way it is a lot of the time.   I'd really like to meet a sweet, caring, nice hot guy|`|UPN3zqq6aa	well most guys cheat lets put it that way, most gus arnt loyal either.  i like shy guys its like awww cute xD|`|DYHXAF2Daa	Most of the time we think this because most of the time hot guys take advantage over the girls and become what they are.    Not all hot guys are mean and jerky. ?|`|wc9FzOiwaa	Because, the "hot" guy might be the type that knows he's hot and figures he can have more than one girl at a time. This from a learning experience.|`|MIafHnKDaa	maybe because evry time we start to think maybe the hot ones are sweet they hurt our hearts and prove us wrong...or right..or whatever..lol|`|adb7eecb0a5b3b1c42e63b0bbaf7f8faaa	Not all hot guys are man- hole's. Well i used to believe that back in high school, until i started college, and realized that not all of them do cheat.The hot guys i hang out with are really nice and respectful, and one of them is actually my boyfreind, and they really do stick to one girl. One thing, they do party all.|`|bdPhs8buaa	It's because girls don't have a magic personality detector and unfortunately the majority of girls go out with people who ask them out.  Conceited cheating assholes generally are also quite confident so they are the ones who do the majority of the asking.|`|QzQ0gU7kaa	Because a lot of times it's true. It depends on what kind of "hot" we're talking about. A lot of times the really appearance-obsessed guys are really self absorbed and care more about themselves than their girl. Guys that are more naturally hot are less often *******.. but sometimes still are if they are used to girls falling all over them.|`|856a96c551b4769dbf17b22c9ed23c6aaa	I don't think all guys are, but sadly most are caught up in themselves and haven't developed personalities. Every guy is different so stereotyping them is wrong.

VxsIDG1Iaa	You have to be more specific, is she keeps on smiling at you but doesn't laugh then yes she still likes you. you have to change your personality when it comes to this. Become more outgoing and listen to her feelings or her problems. girls like guys who listen to them. Ask her to "hangout" not like a "date" she'll understand that and say yes. Then when your hanging out with her, you can change it all... Perhaps your being to boring? Ask yourself this, does she go up to me first to talk? If she does then that's good....
3secB3Smaa	Join a gym. You can meet people there. You can take some classes in judo or art or anything to meet people.  be creative ! Volunteer in a  hospital or somewhere. there are many things you can do if you just thin about it.|`|kEeUsdnYaa	Out of all the advice you get here, the besst one you could possibly get is to follow the link below.  I cannot relate to your scenario as I've never been married but I struggled with meeting women, not into the bar scene and online is just a mess.  (often girls are only there to recieve validation from guys who show interest.)    getagreatgirl.com    I promise you that it will blow your mind.
lLB5nN3paa	The thought of being alone used to depress me but not anymore.  It isn't a feeling I want to live with forever but I can't do anything if it comes naturally.  We all end up alone sometime down the line and we simply need to embrace it.  You really can't trust anyone because you will only be setting yourself up failure if you do.  Society was made to function in such a way that they will backstab you because it is simply how they were built.  Some do it knowingly and others don't, but it is still the same result.  Why wait around and let it happen to you?  You might as well take that depression and turn it into your strength.  After you manage to do that, give society back what they have given you.  Trust me, the feeling is much more thrilling.|`|AA11447210	I don't know about you, but in my life my friends have come in cycles. I've gone long periods of time with no real close friends, and periods of time where I was hanging out with or chatting with my buddies 5 or 6 days a week. The duration of each was months or years.    Hang in there. Perhaps instead of burying yourself in work, try some more social activities to get you around people...a civic club, volunteer work, take a 'fun' class, or take up a hobby that would get you out around others.     I seriously doubt you'll be alone forever, but I do understand how you feel. We get lonely sometimes. That's natural. A couple of years ago I had a great group of friends and we were always planning trips and parties and hanging out and really enjoyed each others company. Over time work, romantic relationships, etc lead folks in other directions and while most of us still keep in touch on some level, my best girlfriend who I used to see almost daily now I may go weeks or months without seeing. If not for me living with one of those friends (roommates) I'd probably go days or weeks without much contact out side of the people I work with.    I know things will ramp up again in the future, with my old friends or new ones...maybe even a romantic relationship *fingers crossed*. Until then I try to always make the best of what I have, be thankful for it, and keep on keepin' on.    ???|`|3secB3Smaa	if you do not keep friends ,you have the responsibility of finding out why.it is important you know the reason. maybe you can talk to a professional to help you. this is an important matter and you need to take care of it.|`|YvpG26Pmaa	I does to me. I'm going through a divorce and the thought of not knowing if I will ever find the one scares me. I'm 30 almost 31.

gKGNeSnPaa	well if hes a Drugi tell him about him self and don't take any crap from him and toughen it out! if hes not then just get into some sort of argument were u get a chance to tell him how u feel, tell him to lay off and that the way he treats your mom is not the write way to treat anyone!!!!!! and if u upset your mom let her know that this isn't the stone age and making decisions together is apart of being married, and make sure she is really happy with him, if shes not then don't be afraid to suggest a divorce. and make sure that he NEVER puts his hands on her in a harmful way. if so, call the cops immediately!|`|MX1shAbcaa	Tell him how you feel man  Best of luck ~  ????i? ?.

4PNdHX81aa	I thought this question was so interesting like it was me or something. I am with a guy who is in school and work and we have a 2mth old.. engages and everything.. I also thought he was cheating. I dont think he is anymore. we fight all the time... I realized that I am very nagging and that he is very picky.  If he is saying you are over reacting, I think you should go to counseling with like a pastor or someone who had a similar situation. I personally from my own similiar experience dont think he is cheating just that he is frustrated.....go to counseling... also you can know if someone is cheating on you if they show no interest in you anymore... I think he is just working more to provide for the new baby and you ..he probably loves you... go to counseling and explain your situation to them and see what they think...because I dont know the whole story...also, he engaged you..that says something....keep hope alive lol|`|WItKOQh7aa	No. Those are the signs.    If he stops reacting to you sexually, that's another big sign.    You're not over reacting, you're just REACTING to the stimuli around you, which is normal, and you should pay attention to your feelings.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Tell him you will not marry him until you solve the issues you have.  Then, he will  1. Bail      or   2. Agree to work on the issues.    Make your decision based on what he does. Simple, really.|`|encb0jc2aa	is he cheating on your in those dreams......oe could it be that in your desire for the perfection of family, you have forgotten the individuality of love, and that eeve nlove gorws, and your heart mut grow too|`|NWH3MnE9aa	He's breathing.|`|SK7MxFTnaa	HOLY RUN ON SENTENCE, BATMAN!|`|iD4ejChZaa	then just keep on drifting--marriage doesn't make it any better.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Well first, if he starts an argument with you every time you question where he's been when he comes home late, that's your first warning sign that he's up to no good.     Does he freak out when you look under the seats of his car? Check his pockets? Open his cell phone? Ask him who some female friend is?    You're not stupid and you're not imagining things. If you think he's up to something, then you have every reason to check it out. Just don't tell him that you suspect him or he'll start being careful. If he thinks you have no idea, hell be less likely to cover his tracks.     good luck...!|`|LVrqRCh8aa	No, I would be asking questions too. Get to the bottom of it!|`|81wvN8Rraa	Your instincts seem right. Time to find out what really going on.|`|AARZV2v0aa	FOLLOW HIM, READ ALL HIS E_MAILS, GET AHOLD OF HIS PHONE!!! ok so thats just crazy, but maybe talking to him about seeing a marriage councilor isnt. Because you both need to talk and maybe with a middle man you can figure out whats really wrong with out all the fighting. But you cant distrust him because that will push him away. Trust, innocent until proven guilty.|`|LJDiSCCNaa	comming home late is not the only sign of a cheater. You'll have to have more than that. But it does sound like he's trying to get out of his responsibility of being a father and partner. He's very young, but he's made some very mature decisions that he needs to stick by. Encourage him to be a daddy, let him know that bonding starts now, his child will not instantly start bonding when the child is 5 or older. If he's working all day, then you should be too. Changing a baby and feeding a baby is not the only tasks you should be doing. If you are not earning an income, then you should be earning your keep. Dishes, laundry and shopping is your job too. Not his. If he does help, you should be thankful. Yes, thankful, because I don't know how often full time at home moms go out to earn an income to HELP him with his job of providing.|`|diXVR4aeaa	I don't think you're over reacting at all. You're engaged, have a baby together and feel like your drifting apart. My advice is to talk about it with him, tell him exactly how you feel. If I thought my fianc was cheating on me or not being faithful I would approach the situation like this;    ''I'm feel a little left out of your life lately and I just want to know if I'm doing something to push you away. We have a beautiful baby together and I was thinking we should start spending more quality time together. I feel we've been drifting apart and it's really getting to me, I haven't been ''PMSing'' - I think if anything I've just been worried. If were going to be getting married we need to make sure were both ready for this, after all we have a child to raise together. I love you and youre the man of my dreams, I would never want our relationship to end in bad terms let alone end at all.''     I don't know you're fianc, obviously, so you might need to critique it. However, you deserve to know the truth. If you're going to marry the father of your baby you need to make sure you're both on the same page. If not, pack it up and move on, cheating is cheating, even if he is the ''George Clooney'' of your life.     I wish you all the best, good luck!
Amnjqfk0aa	Tell them what happened, they might sit with you, or talk to you or be friends. to find new friends look around the room, hear people talking about things you like, join in no one cares if you walk by and join a conversation,and to answer the questions, play the sympathy card or just say im mad at them or just plain out they ditched me and im shy.|`|IPATFSAcaa	I would hang out with othe rpeople.. No big deal.. That's why you need to have a lot of friends.|`|LrBI8U0uaa	ignore their questioning stares. be more outgoing and try to find new people to talk to... the same happened to me it sucks i know but i survived.  This could be a time to think about if they were really good friends in the first place and what you really want ur new friends to be like, how you want to be treated by them.|`|vPkQpNQHaa	join a sports team   that could always give you new friends  and if they rejected me i would probably kill them and find new friends
697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	good way to stand up and be a great example of a young woman today, a woman who obiviously prides herself on character & doesn't give her * $&% *(&$ away to just anyone.
3qsD30W0aa	take it as a compliment, atleast people arent running away from you.
AA11330914	you need to ask her why she doesnt like it and doesn't want to hang out with you when you are trying to express how u feel for her by giving her a quick peck on the cheek. if u do it in front of her parents i can understand why. or in public, she may be the kind of person who hates pda(public displays of affecton)..?!|`|dcZuFIKuaa	wait until she makes the first move. she doesnt want to move fast

But if I was looking for a partner yes|`|EMKuBql8aa	My mom can't really cook so I would have been used to it, lol    But I am lucky, my wife is an amazing cook, and she likes it.

0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	It's not you. He'll come out of it. If he isn't showing signs of improvement in a few weeks then maybe suggest he speak with his doctor. There is also FREE treatment in the form of light therapy. Study up on it and see what changes you can make around the house.|`|AA11447210	For now, do as he asks and back off. If the situation continues, suggest he see someone about it. Some people do have seasonal depression, or work/personal life get them down and their libido suffers temporarily. Are things at work more stressful than usual? How about regarding his family or friends or others close to him? Anything on his find (finances or anything)? Life stress can be an issue for some people, and sex ends up being the last thing on their mind.    The issue also with men is while a woman can have sex any time, even if she's not "in the mood", a guy typically can't...if he's not "there" in the moment, then no erection means no sex (at least not intercourse).     Let him know you are there for him, support him, and give it a bit more time before becoming concerned it's a total change in the relationship and not just a temporary speed bump.|`|1f2zrdSuaa	maybe hes not himself anymore and needs a little space.He cant do anything if maybe your always around him all the time ? maybe if its not you you could try to have a little talk with him and tell whats going on.maybe hes having family or friend problems and cant do anything.last respond, maybe he is too busy to talk about his feelings make him respond to your words .try cheering him up a bit rock his world .i give great advice if this works try telling people about my great advice i need fans and friends hope this works sincerely d.fab
SYpVGGJTaa	You should include everyone. If you need to cut back on the guest list be more particular about the families you invite ( invite fewer more close friends & family).|`|im3vWyv6aa	That's funny you should ask... one of my best friends did this. She was my high school best friend, she was in my wedding... she got married several years later. The invitation said nothing about "adults only", so I filled out the reception card for me, my hubby and my kids (I think I had two kids at the time). I got a phone call later from my friends mom and was told that the kids were not allowed...    Now, I was not "upset"... but I did think it was strange. It was my first time to hear of such a thing. However, we did not go because, due to budget, I didn't want to get a babysitter.    Best wishes...|`|76nTvO4iaa	IF you want an adults only reception, it is your right to have one.    When I had young children & it was an in-town adult only  wedding, I thought it was great!  Get a babysitter, get dressed up & go to a wedding & fun party with my husband.    Out of town adult only weddings (requiring one or more nights in a hotel) got complicated.  If was a family wedding, I usually couldn't go because the family members I'd ask to watch my children were going to the wedding.  Friends weddings were easier.  I'd just call a family member, ask them to come stay with the children so DH & I could go.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Sorry, my kids are now adults, but had they been young?  NO problem.  As a matter of fact, now that I think about it, I did get babysitters when we would go to a wedding reception and it wasn't even an "adults only" reception.  I just viewed it as a night out with my husband, so no need to bring the kids along!      Don't let your family and friends ruin it for you.  Stick to what you want.  If people choose not to come....their loss!|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I wouldn't be angry, but I just find this so confusing. Since when did kids become second-class citizens and totally unwelcome at weddings? I'm not directing that at you, but I've seen so many questions lately on the same topic.    In my family, kids are a huge, important part of the family. I could not imagine having a wedding to which my young cousins were not invited. Weddings are family events - they aren't cocktail parties - and I wouldn't ask friends or relatives to leave out a crucial part of their family so I can have my sterilized, picture-perfect day. Nor have I ever seen a child ruin a wedding, or take attention from the bride, or cause any other kind of disaster.    So that's my take, I guess. I'm not saying you're wrong or you shouldn't do your own thing. I just have a different perspective.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	Your guests should understand, but again "should" is a big word to many. I have a 2 year old and would respect the bride and groom's wishes. But if they want their kids there, take it as a case by case scenario. Might sound a little unfair but a buget holds the key.  My daughter is a lot of fun and likes to join in the fun. My friends always ask me to bring her. She eats my food so they often don't care. It's ultimately you and your fiance's decision. Congrats!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You bet. Weddings are for family and friends to celebrate - of all ages.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	No it is not wrong to do so...You know your budget so dnt let them upset you... You keep your plans and the rest of your friends and family will have to dealwith it...|`|pKzH1cFHaa	I can see why they are mad. What are they supposed to do with their kids for that long? And what if some of them are traveling far? Think of what they would have to do in order to make it to your wedding.|`|ScHW4842aa	I think not inviting anyone above the age of 15 is a bit rough. I mean, they arent kids at that age.     As for the rest of the young kids? I would not invite them, no matter what my budget is. I would make it adults only. No reason given.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	It is your wedding day, if people want to share it with you then they can do it without kids..I have 4 kids and would not feel bad with your scenario..it is almost (but not quite) when you visit someone and assume you can take your dog..now not to put kids and pets on the same line but honestly..no one wants to have a bunch of kids around when the day is about you and your intended  Best To you Both!! Remember it is your day!!!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	When I was a kid, my parents refused to attend any function where kids weren't invited.     I am not a parent but I would have no issues getting a babysitter if my children were not invited. I personally have never been to a wedding that was adults-only but I wouldn't be upset over it since it is not my place to judge the couple's decision.|`|IxoazyHUaa	no I would not be upset, if they want an adults only reception, that is their choice.  It is your choice if you want to go, most people can spend one night out without their kids.|`|97e203321264077846c0132c575f8c57aa	I do think that from 1-17 is abit rough but your call. I think you just have to accept some people won't attend if you decide to have it this way and really i think its sad kids are left out because if they are not exposed to these occasions they will never learn the proper way to behave at such occasions.|`|RQc8fbjbaa	I think it is okay. This is their special day and should be how ever they want.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	i would think it was an odd request, but if i couldnt get a babysitter, i probably wouldnt attend the wedding|`|p6zZqeuQaa	naw man its all cool|`|Pz8rIt26aa	I think it's fine.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	I can understand why people would be upset, but it's your wedding day. Because a lot of people will be offended by this, they will not bother looking for a babysitter. They just won't go to the wedding. If you think it's worth it to not have some people at the reception, go ahead. I understand where you're coming from, but it really depends on how many of your guests have children. If there are quite a few, I think you probably f*cked up.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	i don't think you should have kids at weddings to begin with so no i would not be upset with an adult reception|`|FzS3aphWaa	All of my friends visit my home and interact with me and my children.  If you are not a close enough friend that you have been to my home, you would most probably not invite me to your wedding.  I would consider it a snub to be invited to attend alone.  A wedding is for those people who love you to be there for you and celebrate with you.  Therefore, I would expect that my teenagers would attend with me.    However, if I was invited to a co-workers wedding, I would send a gift with my regrets .|`|4ZdA7wbXaa	it is YOUR wedding if kids aren't there so much the better. Simply because people aren't worried about kids wandering, there are no kids having a hissy fit. I have been to both ones with kids and ones without guess what the ones without were great. No one had to tamper down what they were saying because of little kids hearing...    Would I be offended nope again it is your wedding.|`|AA11566437	NO!  It's your wedding.  It should be about you and not them.  My husband and I did an elopement ceremony --no family nor friends.  We used  the money that would have been used for the reception to buy a new home.|`|mTKD9GQvaa	well my for my wedding Im only inviting aunts and uncles, no cousins at all, even though I have one aged 45! If we decided to invite all the cousins and becuase some of them are married or have partners, i would have to add another 240 plus guests!! no way, its already 250 as it is! We are concerned about the fact that two of the groomsmen have young kids, but we are arranging a babysitter for all the younger ones, and a few minibuses for all the cousins to come to the evening reception, with adults to look after them!|`|RuKK1LYiaa	nope since its the bride and grooms day i have not problem with it,|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	It doesn't bother me at all. Receptions are mostly for the grown ups anyway, so I wonder about people who go ballistic b/c their three year old doesn't get to run amok for a few hours.|`|VpCtXEMGaa	If the wedding is in town, I leave my children with a sitter. Period. If I don't have a sitter I don't go. I don't understand why people would be offended by an adult only reception.|`|mjyRcxUHaa	When I go to weddings if it's 6pm or later I always get a babysitter anyways. An afternoon wedding should include kids, it's harder to get a babysitter. That being said.     Given these tough times consider this, the average wedding is about 4 hours long plus travel time, so your "parents" have all ready spend 30.00 on a "cheap" babysitter before they walk into that reception door.  Plus drinks, Plus your wedding gift. No wonder there mad they want to share in your special day, but now they can't afford it.     If I was invited to your wedding I probably wouldn't be able to make it, or my husband and I would be deciding who would be staying home with the kids and who was going.  If you were a relative or a real good friend I would be really mad and sad that I couldn't come.     I'm sorry If I added to your sadness. Getting married is supposed to the most wonderful thing to happen in your life, but instead it ends up being the most stressful thing you will ever have to endure.  Peace be with you!! Good Luck!!    P.S. You know what kept me sane was just thinking about the honeymoon. Soon we will be off on vacation, yippee!!|`|AA10086844	I'm not a parent, but I am having an adults only reception.  I have a brother that is 4, and my FI has 5 nieces and nephews that are under 5.  We are going to hire a babysitter that will be in the next room to watch all of the kids.  There will be movies, popcorn, kids games and crafts and kid-friendly food (we are thinking either pizza or happy meals).  They will be close enough for the parents to go check on them, but they will not be at the reception.    Whatever you choose, don't let people make you feel bad.  This is YOUR day, and it is about you and your future husband.    Good luck and congratulations.|`|JXMjscVmaa	It does not bother me  (in my big family its common) but I think I know why your guests are  upset    When I answer a question I look at other question's the person has asked to help me give you the best answer I can and I found you have a 9 month old that you don't like leaving with a sitter and don't go to a lot of places because of  that yet you expect them to some may find that upsetting!|`|XaUvCKMqaa	an adult only reception is perfectly alright. it is after all a request by the couple and should be respected. i had my wedding an adults only reception. guests will understand it especially if its a formal party. i know it will be weird especially for your relatives who have kids. but the good thing is, they try to contact you ahead and let you know that they will be bringing in a kid(s) with them. at least you'll have at least an estimate how many kids there will be  if you really cannot avoid kids in your reception, try having a separate menu for the kids. what i did was talk to my caterers, let them know my dilemma over kids and they designed a menu for them. not so costly with the other food. they also have a special spot with them so that all kids were together and have their own buffet.     good luck and best wishes!|`|vOUDHws3aa	Oh my goodness no!   While I love my son with all of my heart, even if the invitation didn't specify "adults only", I would never bring him to a wedding. My son is a very well behaved 7 year old but it wouldn't be fair to him to make him sit through it, and it wouldn't be fair to the couple to take a chance on the way he would act when he would inevitably get bored.  Other than those two things, it would also be fun to have an adults only bash. I'm sure some of your guests would enjoy a little face time with other adults without having to wipe faces or cut up meat :)    All of those aside, this is your day. Don't focus too much on what you think other people will think, just make this the most special day of your life. God willing, you'll only do it once.|`|qfbDMVKKaa	I think unless children are in the immediate family (son, daughter, sister, brother) guests should respect your decision.  Let them spring for a babysitter. If children are well behaved and want to see the bride have them at the ceremony.  Nothing spoils a wedding ceremony or reception more than young children being at a ceremony wailing and fussing, or at the reception their "mommy" and "daddy" think running around the dance floor and crawling under tables is cute.        If out of town guests have children, perhaps you can find a couple of friends you trust could watch their children.    I love children and have two.  Unless they were specifically invited to a wedding, I found a sitter.  Then I went to the wedding and enjoyed an evening out.    Especially with the costs of a reception, limiting the number of children keeps your budget in line.
aVDyZFxqaa	Yes.|`|3secB3Smaa	It depends. it could be a wrong choice or it could be a right one. it depends on the people .|`|AA12290249	yes.|`|a3QNUrdfaa	yes i do.|`|AA12354369	YES. its wrong to have sex at all until marriage.|`|blOfX1nhaa	I did and a guy fell crazy in luve with me....he freaked me out and I backed off...Dont try be miss goody girl coz guys hate that|`|gtMVl7qvaa	according to GOD you shoudl only have sex when you are married but you'll find out how much he knows abou you when you DIE so my answer is no but us being humans if both are consensual adults and noone is drunk i know your flesh will give in
tr5lG02Xaa	first, kick him right in the balls. second, brake his wrist while he is down. third, kick him in the face 3 times. four, go tell an adult that he fell and he wants to have sex with you|`|e8BgKv8caa	if he asks again, just tell him that u arent ready for that, and that if he keeps asking for that ull break up with him.|`|XqAWm9Yjaa	be with someone eles|`|KATCMfLSaa	hesss a creeperr u should tell someone if a guy asks once or twice then its ok but he really needs to respect your boundarys if u say no it means no. dont let anyone pressure you into doing somethin u dont want to|`|XL3pa9Obaa	start by getting away from him..  this guy seems like a jerk for trying to rape you like this  tell someone
UFz0IGgeaa	your guy friend probably likes you. idk if the guy you like is really like that but if he is, then yes you should give up on him. my advice is to ask some of your female friends about that guy you like.|`|JFiycKwFaa	Yes. You should. Since one of your guy friends should know what they're talking about. He's obviously not worth it. He probably will treat you like crap and you'll want better. So don't waste your time.|`|ddWyRjmVaa	Yes! been there done that.  SCREW HIM!!|`|cQpuofcjaa	I think you should go with what your heart and mind tells you most likly will be right and also the worst that could hep pen is you two break up and hey you never know until you try. You can spend the rest of your life wondering if this guy is right for you so just do it!
iVeAcMjcaa	Not a girl but I can tell you this from experience.  If you left it bad and havent talked since then your chances are very low.  We all tend the remember the bad things first and it is really hard to show the good.But one thing a friend who is widowed always told me that as long as she is alive there is always a chance.  i would play this very slow,very very slow.  you will have to show that you are comepletely a new person with actions not words. You may have to wait for her to even date others while you watch.  that will be hard but patience is your only chance.  can even take years.  good luck|`|H2bpuDsKaa	this is all water under the bridge.......if your ex-gf wanted to contact you, I'm sure she would have found a way to do so by now......move on with your life and forget her.......|`|K5IOSGXAaa	what is your question please?|`|AA12272885	What is the question?
AA12290249	means you're not faking to be hard to get, it means that you're just naturally that way and have standards that a lot of people might not fit into. but having those standards can help a lot in finding a good companion. but you never know :)|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	well some people act or play games trying to make a person there really are not that interested in them.. however some people have been hurt and really take there time in getting serious with a person in a relationship.|`|VQdHstWtaa	Basically, you dont act like your hard to get you are.. meaning its not a game were u actually want the guy/girl but ur just teasing.. you u really are hard to get/please
6jZcr33paa	It's your wedding day so you should play what you like, including fun songs. As long as it's not vulgar your guests should just go with it and have a good time. I went over my playlist many times worrying how people would feel about songs as minuscule as "Shout!" from the Animal House soundtrack then I thought "Who cares? It's fun to dance to!"|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If you like it then use it. You should be able to have fun at your reception instead of it being so stuffy that you can't enjoy yourselves.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	If by 'at the wedding' you mean in church, that's not a great idea.      If you mean at the reception, absolutely.  It is a great song.  Catchy tune, good nostalgia, not bad to dance to.|`|AA11330914	yeah. not the best idea. a lot of ppl do the chicken dance tho believe it or not lol|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Nope, any song you guys like is fine. It's your wedding and if you pick fun songs people will be more likely to dance and let loose! One of my friends played the Chicken Dance!|`|aMlWMkO5aa	Yes, it is childish. But, if you and your fiancee have silly personalities then go for it.|`|ghLdIUz0aa	if you have alcohol at your wedding, they will dance to anything, drunk people dont care, lol. but i think its whatever you two like, if you want that song, then play it!
JZabWXGpaa	I have never bought from this site but here are a few tips for buying a wedding dress online.    1.  Do they show the picture of the actual dress you are getting or is it a picture of a designer dress that they are going to duplicate?  You need to see a picture of the actual dress.    2.  What kind of return policy do they have?    3.  Can you pay through Paypal?  Use a credit card too.    4.  Contact them and talk to them. Email them.  How responsive are they?    5.  What kind of shipping methods do they use?    If you check out these things and you are ok with them, then it might be alright.  But I am always leary of any website that puts pictures of designer wedding dresses portraying them as the actual dress you will get.    Hope this helps.  Best of Luck|`|FXBzY6D8aa	hi alot of times their just poor knockoffs or imitations of the real thing but the are really cheep and pretty tho i had a friend buy a wedding dress frhaoulof yrs ago i believe it was black with flos quinndestones on the dress but she sold to sommeone else or se  she got married and got her money bac or the or she did. not for sure whitch one it was so way long ago but she was really pretty in the black dress ema she also got re money back for the dress when she was done wearing the dress and or useing the dress well ipis works out foiyour choosing and deciding tough choices ainre hard so think about it and then decide ok on what you shoud do god bless you hope works out for you and congrats to you|`|Pz8rIt26aa	A lot of times they are poorly made knockoffs ie....crooked stitching, bad color fabric etc...

H5PGsG3paa	... i met a guy like that.  like i didnt date him or anything but i know him & im friends with him.  & he dates every month, every 2 weeks its a different girl. & it really sucks for those girls cause most of them are like you. they're all excited and everything but you will get dumped soon, if hes the guy i think he is. I think guys like these, just want a good reputation with the girls. He told me his 'strategy'  before about dating girls, since he is never single for more than a week. When hes with you, he's going to be flirting with other girls because when he gets bored with you, he will have a rebound. I guess other guys will praise him for this and look @ him as some sort of god? :P   But why would you date someone who your friend has dated before?   You seem really nervous about your first kiss, but he seems like hes a player and gets 'around with the ladies. . . would you want to have your first kiss with someone like him?  OR  i could be totally wrong :P but i think he is moving too fast. Don't do things that will make you uncomfortable :) but i think you should tell him you're nervous with/about him because hes your first boyfriend and everything . but don't make it sound lame :P|`|CFU77qCbaa	Ugh I'm 9 and I had a bf in 3rd grade named Brandon.

You give no indication here that he is playing you but again it sounds like he is just snooping because he doesn't trust you.

That's what's PC.|`|YuPgCN74aa	In reality a man probably would. But girls fight dirty!     0_o    Strange question by the way, good job.|`|XSHWYBcWaa	women      Jedi mind tricks|`|g59U5kwUaa	people would think man but men cant hit women well they shouldn't (:|`|kMEG4tKVaa	WOMAN!!!!  she kicks the man in the nuts and as he is bending she sticks her fingers in his eyeballs and shoves his nose cartillage into his brain. voila! man is dead|`|Bx2w3h0faa	Men.    Because men have more upper body strength than women. Even if a woman starts working out and gains muscle mass she will still have a diffacult time winning a fight because men have an extra upper body mass that overpowers females,    Womens bodies are made more different their upper body is more elegant and softer than a mans. Thats why most womens shoulders are more narrow and frailer then mens broad shoulders.    And when men get angry they can take it over the top more aggressive then women. They go in a trance its a berserk mode where they basically dont feel anything when they are pissed because they are lost into the fighting. Basically they could care less if something was broken during the fight or got seriously injured because all that adrenaline is rushing to there brain which gives them a quicker reactions through there muscles.    Sadly women could only win if they had a weapon. Sorry ladies.|`|hY7zp2Umaa	Woman wins ! u know y?    answer:  WOW ! u call a man tat fight a woman a "man"? he's a woman !
Ggs8MC9gaa	just be there for her sometimes you dont have to say anything you just have to listen
p3AbTmbfaa	I will smell your feet and love doing it.|`|QYDYX9B7aa	Think he does|`|Q3WweuOCaa	is hella and hecka french? I don't speak it, or urban!|`|4bpBn6Taaa	no|`|PdSeeHdkaa	go ask him
YKNModheaa	second 1
Man2R06Kaa	go 4 it im a girl and i feel the same way about this guy i wish he would approach me
ltGC79jxaa	I agree with misery loves company. Heres my story. I dated my boyfriend for 3 years and I broke up with him in October. We remained friends until around xmas. He called me and asked if I think about him. I said i did. So I started thinking that I do miss him and want to be with him. Well he met a girl thru his cousin around xmas and by new years eve she had already moved in with him. I felt so hurt because it took him two years before he even suggested that we live together. He told me after 5 days he loved her. Not to mention she is 12 years younger than him. So I can feel your pain.  I am pretty depressed and have lost 12 pounds in 2 weeks. I have no appetite, I can't sleep, and all I do is fester on their relationship and wonder if its working out or if they are having problems. I have no life, I dont want to do anything.  Enough abut me, whats going on with your relationship.|`|xArlqHtraa	Don't worry, you're not alone.    I'm miserable because my best friends don't really seem to care about me. They're so much closer with each other than they are with me. They invite each other to all these different activities and they don't bother to invite me. My boyfriend goes to a different high school, so I haven't seen him in almost two months. To make it worse, we haven't talked with each other in about a week and a half. I'm going crazy because I miss him so much! I feel so alone, too.
nolxYfzUaa	Been there.  Why not just be friends and see where that leads ya.  Don't talk to him all the time, let the heart speak to you and let the heart miss him.  If it doesn't, then move on.     Good luck.|`|qNNcJ2B6aa	if he sais u should try it again, then just tell him straight up.......  that will be the simplest and best way,    hope that helped :)|`|7vfBu0x2aa	try it. you never know what will happen if you don't try|`|IN1X1CVGaa	ive done this so many times  and if you dont go for it again now  you might lose him for good    so go for it!  he makes you happy! :D|`|DaMfwYpXaa	Just talk to him about it im sure he will say yes and if you li,ke me email thesilversteel@yahoo.com|`|mL07N3IAaa	well then you guys should go for it! i don't see any problem here! he loves you and so do you! he wants to try it again, and you do too! so i say go for it!   good luck! xox|`|lVGOFmAZaa	just picture yourself like a year from now without him in your life. now picture yourself a year from now with him in your life. whichever makes you happier is what you should go with. it is natural to still have feelings for him, but they might fade, or they might not. you should make a pros and cons list, and if you have more pros than cons, you should stick with him|`|BL9CQgcAaa	seduce him till his urs again|`|bezBxm2laa	I'll be honest with you. It will be awkward if you go out with him again. Sorry, it's a fact of life. But then again... how old are you? No one will care that much if you wait a month if you are 14, but high school... thats another story. Be friends.|`|aNZW4J15aa	You should give him something that he has always wanted, and maybe go on a date to explain what a BIG mistake you made.  Hope it helps!|`|cX3yqEtVaa	Go out and have fun.. Sounds like you are in highschool maybe?  Just have fun.. dont take the relationship too seriously.. just have fun with a bf|`|sXT86Swqaa	I think the reason why you broke up with him in the first place is because you're afraid of having your heartbroken in case HE breaks up with you. At least when YOU break up with him you know it's coming.|`|kpJrsuNHaa	If u really liked him u wouldnt be thinking like this u would be with him   seems like ur just so use to being around him
sI4MK0KAaa	he should have been a man and said it to your face. if he cant do something as small as that how will he ever face up to bigger problems. ive never broken up by sms, its not the right way|`|9ionkBvuaa	i think he should have told you in person.|`|9mzwqTIzaa	He should've broken up in person. That wasn't right, what he did.|`|YEC4Zilraa	who says wats right and wrong on how to break up. wether it be email  mail. sky written messages. or anything of that nautre if its over it over move on stop whining.|`|WlnnsGM5aa	No its not right, but that is what happened, so you better start gettng over it.|`|tZeinApEaa	never mind him there is plenty more fish in the sea and better boys out there for you that would tell you there is a problem in person than acting like a child about tings|`|4ZKKrWWfaa	yeah im sorry to say this but you guys did break up|`|ltGC79jxaa	1 word...coward
SDFdbQT2aa	Go see you might meet her there.
ScEG7QEjaa	I think that its a compliment that he wants to hook you up with his friend.  Its like hes saying, "You don't have a boyfriend yet? Why don't you go out with my friend? You're a nice girl!"  I think you should go ahead and talk to his friend. Start by making small talk, and once you feel you have a bond; a connection with eachother then I say go ahead and ask him!    Go get 'em Tiger!|`|aBVeJwc5aa	I think his friend likes you!|`|163ae1d9172d4b808ffa71cdc379b9daaa	i think his friend likes you, but he told your friend to sort of ask you! :D  you should add him and then leave him a comment or message or something. if he doesnt think you like him back, then he'll eventually move on. hope that helped! :D|`|gtMVl7qvaa	I like  1's answer but you can't change your fate if it's meant to be it will happen if not ...it's probably for the best because he's probably a jerk and a waste of your time anyways|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Ask the first friend to be in a three way chat with him to get to know him and break the ice, then go for it when you know him a little.|`|iIkW1eWIaa	I think you should talk to him. Two weeks isn't that long ago. Now a year or more is longer. If you feel more comfortable talking in person, then do that. If not, then send him a message online. I would just tell him who you are though, and not how you got his screen name (unless he asks).|`|FB1zwZkMaa	Maybe, his friend likes you.  Don't do anything. If it's meant to be, then you don't have to do anything to make it happen because IT will HAPPEN. =)  Hope that helps! =)|`|Pi4R6tINaa	This is confusing. Your best bet is probably to just kill him|`|bdade993e630dbc15f1df344277bad03aa	talk to your friend about meeting this guy in person. Don't wait and pretend you are some sort of princess waiting to be rescued. Be casually about meeting the person.|`|TZkyrnlyaa	I think you should too!  :D  Maybe the guy you have a crush on likes you.  Tell him that you think hes cute and that you would go out with him.  Trust me it will work.|`|g3wqfjCxaa	I would guess that he is trying to hook his friend up with you.  I think you should send him a message the next time he is online.
TcuDj5J7aa	First of all, let me just tell you that everything is going to be okay. It may feel like the end of the world right now, but it isn't, I promise. Don't worry about her liking the sophomore. Chances are, most girls will like the older guys anyway - it's just how we are. But that doesn't mean that you will never have a girlfriend. I know that you have probably heard it before, but you are still young. It's not like you are gonna get married tomorrow, you know? I'm not trying to put you down or hurt your feelings, but just keep your head up. Don't worry about this girl, and act like it doesn't even bother you. You never know, she may just change her mind and see what a great guy you really are!|`|YFgREceaaa	o im heartbroken for you..poor little twat|`|4bpBn6Taaa	awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww  how sad|`|I3ugar6naa	aww. :(|`|FOkDPXLAaa	did she say it while you were around her? maybe she's trying to make you jealous.  or to want her :)    i know how hard it is when the one you really like is acting stupid.  but i had my friend ask out my new 'shy' boyfriend for me.  o_o so yeah.    just let mother nature's bell ring. you'll know when the time is right to ask her out.  you'll feel your heart race fast..and you will smile a little.|`|y6vcfJ0paa	awwww i wouldnt have rejected you! well depends im soo sorry im heartbroken too!
eFXD3Qzcaa	Just talk to her and explain how you feel about her.  It's completely up to her to decide whether or not to go out with you though.  It also depends on how loyal a friend she is...
mC8iwbVCaa	nooo ,  she's probablly saying that she'll see you any other time,  not that she wants you to do stuff with her!  she's just telling you that she'll find you whenever she needs a smile,  or any other times she's not busy or something.     hahaha.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	it just means she's drunk. i think she probably meant that she'll talk to you even if she doesn't want to raise a smile. like, if she didn't say that, then that would mean she would only talk to you when she was sad. which is dumb.|`|1XmpLRueaa	She says that she will find you if she's really bored and wants some entertainment.|`|lkmOWkk4aa	I think she is trying to find u|`|IjSU81dvaa	It means if she is bored that she will find you. She probably thinks you are a nice guy. But not if you are gonna be saying : Does she want me to fxck her?" That is gay. I am sorry But she means maybe hang out.     She said she had A nice time. Maybe anther time would be kool too. So thats what she means. She wants to hang out agian.|`|oUuDyzVmaa	she just means wen she is bored and feels like some fun with u because idk bout u but having my good friends with me wen im bored def. brightens up my day. and bout that 'any other time bit', i think it means the same thing.... its fun to be round ur good friends any time no matter what time it always makes me, and anyone else, happy.|`|bdade993e630dbc15f1df344277bad03aa	more on the companion side. Your choices are very narrow and extreme.|`|sYD3CNfZaa	lmao she saying she'll find whenever shes bored|`|3Ug4lY4Qaa	I think it means just that, like shell call u when shes bored or somthing... as firneds.l|`|vPkQpNQHaa	this is my opinion but i think you're over analyzing it|`|KQWSWxZJaa	She'll find you if she needs your help with something, if she needs someone to listen to her, if she needs someone to talk to...etc..|`|kpJrsuNHaa	its just a txt but if u want something else with her, then drop hints on her and be better than her bf|`|oZuiq138aa	lol doesnt even "smell" or sound like she wants sex,  she will just be friends with u thats all|`|MnFj47dxaa	I totally agree you're over analyzing.  I don't see anything in there that implies she wants to be more than friends.  Just saying thanks for the good times.|`|ZpHnCQy6aa	didn't she say she was drunk.but sound like she wants to get it on.if u know what i mean.|`|0MkGrploaa	I honestly think she means as a friend.  Like she will find you if she is ever bored again.  Also, she said she might be a little drunk, so you cant really go by what she is saying.|`|4OlslkMmaa	She just wants to be your companion.  Your reading too much into her message. Maybe your hoping for more with her?  Honestly, it sounds like a pretty simple and friendly text.
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	you cant do anything   you BOTH knew fromt he start that you only wanted sex from onw another so that is the only thing she is after. You cant make her change her mind.   Maybe she has thought about it and that is why she is taking more interest in your life - make sure it is what you BOTH want this time if it does go down that path.  Does she already have a boyfriend? if you guys are only doing the deed there isnt anything stopping her from having one you know.|`|JUEkTETAaa	just ask her why and ask what can you do to be it  or is there something that you should know
NUWdgQuraa	You must now ask him out.  He thinks you rejected him, and that's the only way to undo what you did.    Remember, he's just as nervous as you are.  Just be yourself.  If he likes you for you, it will get easier as time goes on.    Not everyone is the same.  If you learned from your mistakes, you shouldn't commit them again.
v0qm71o1aa	I do it when needed.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Yes.|`|Gz4vODGGaa	i don't really care as long as we're moving
cYNifeZTaa	Trust me I had the same EXACT problem. Just cause your friends have doesn't mean you do. I had NEVER had a boyfriend in my life. I used to think I wasn't pretty enough or fast enough. Thenn I realized it's their lives not mine. You don't need a boyfriend to feel complete or popular or any of that stuff just be you and the right guy will come along. You'll suprised how many guys you could get without trying so hard.   Besides going out with someone just for streed cred is wrong You could end up hurting someone's feelings. I know it's easier said than done but it will pay off. I clicked on this question because you remind me of myself. I know you may feel left out but beleive me it's not a big deal.  P.S. you never know that cutie in the corner could be crushin on you, girl! Just give it time.    GOOD LUCK, HUN!!|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Keep on keeping on.  Do be picky about the boys you meet.  You are doing great.  The other girls feel prettier, smarter, better because they are comparing themselves to you.  They are probably not such great guys.  The good ones are harder to find.  Let them find you.  Go to bookstores, sports things, join co-ed volley ball.  Let it happen naturally.  You are doing just fine.  I rather think now days the girls with boyfriends are the ones giving out.  Value your virginity and don't give it away lightly.  it is a special one time gift.  I'm not saying wait til marriage.  I'm saying wait until you know you love him and you KNOW he loves you.    You're doing just fine.  Relax.  The other girls are all worried about how they can keep their boyfriends, look sexy, is she flirting with him,  etc, etc.  Waiting until the boys and you are more mature is really smarter.  Blessings.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Don't worry about.  You probably better off, those who wait are up to get the best.  Don't pay attention to your friends.  I'm not married and most of my friend are married and some of them very unhappy.  Don't date anybody on line.  There too many losers and rapist.  Be patient dear, God has not finish with you yet.  God bless you and give you the best boyfriend.  I want to see your friend's faces.
OCXDnUWLaa	Well, your course here seems simple.    She's saying you don't talk to her, and since you got your friend to ask her out FOR you, it seems like she's right. I know it's nerve wracking to talk to girls, but the more you talk to this girl, the easier it will be carrying conversations with her.    A simple "hello" is a good start. At least saying hi to her will build up your confidence and such. Even shy people can handle a greeting, right?
nHPoKBrRaa	Well it's not that they might get annoyed maybe just a little freaked out depending on the way you look at him. If you stare at him with sweet eyes then its ok. if he doesn'tt get freaked out it's be cause he noticed that you like him and if he keeps taring back at you it means he probably likes you too.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	I like it if she is good looking or decent.|`|AA12354369	YES.  Its inappropriate and rude to stare.  ask him out instead. talk to him at least|`|I9dw8eWsaa	some do it just depends on the guy
QkmoNX2Qaa	Hey  Well, you need to remember that she's going out with YOU for a reason :)  And thats why she chose you over him.  Theyre best friends but she prob doesn't think of him as any more than that, especially if you have been going out for a year.  I would maybe talk to her and just tell her that you love her but you are slightly uncomfortable when she always hangs out with him. Don't tell her to stop hanging out with him or anything coz that is harsh and controlling.   I know that you must feel jealous and stuff about him but yea if she really is serious about you she would consider making some compromise or some type of consideration for you. If not, then I think you should find some other girls out there. But see what she has to say first.    If you know that she's not the type of girl to cheat then don't worry, if you thik she may than I really would suggest you to tell her how you feel.     Goodluck. But she's going out with YOU for that reason.   X|`|0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	I'd say she's no longer your girlfriend...|`|IUlIixJLaa	As long as you trust her then let her have her friends, guys or girls|`|32f48ab0216e5d9dd249d8e976b61a9caa	tell her how you feel you can't stop her until she knows how you feel about it|`|aLgY4l3Naa	You need to talk to her guy, don't try and keep these feelings inside she is your girl and she needs to know exactly how you feel!! She needs to understand that its not just her but both of you in this relationship and if she does not consider your feelings then maybe you two don't belong together!! Im a woman and don't think its appropriate to be hanging out with a guy by myself when i have a boyfriend, NOT COOL!! You should not feel inferior to any man when its comes to your woman, she needs to respect you enough to have regard for the way you feel, its not about you being jealous, as much as it is that she needs to care for your feelings above anyone else!! Love and respect yourself enough to know that you matter and that you deserve to be happy in your relationship!! Good luck to you and i hope all works out!!|`|FZGNyoFtaa	Cut down the time you talk and spend with her by 1/2. She should ask to spend more time with you within 2 weeks. If she doesn't seem to care that you are not with her as much, you're done. Politely tell her it's not working out and don't look back.|`|WNxTv08Taa	Stop being so jealous, nobody likes a control freak.  She needs her own space and if she is fooling around then you're young anyway and you'll have plenty of other chances.|`|e039f51191f97c9f36c87089f736457baa	If she can't get your feelings then finish it.  If you are going to college you could do with a clean sheet.    Good Luck|`|KQL3tqS7aa	If it is something that obviously bothers you, then tell her how you are feeling.  Get it out in the open that you don't feel comfortable about her being with him all the time.  If she is serious about your relationship, then she will work on making you happy as well.  I know I would worry if a guy was hanging out with his girl friend...I don't blame you for worrying!|`|uu3uVh9faa	I'd say forget her and concentrate on your studies, they're more important then a so called girlfriend who spends more time with her "friend" then with you.
oFJ6SDpzaa	Well personaly to me its not that inportant to me but i kinda like it when my girlfriends are bi|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Very he doesn't want to lose you to a girl.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Most guys won't care or think it's "hot", but some would have a problem with it if you waited a while before telling them. It's not something that they need to know on the first date or anything, though you could drop hints....but I'd tell him on the second or first, at least. Either way, it's pretty important to be up front if you think you're going to get serious with him, as soon as you know you really like him.|`|AA10079820	not that important.|`|G3RnxAyyaa	VERY IMPORTANT!  If your boyfriend was bisexual wouldn't you want him to tell you?|`|MSJEyhSJaa	It can be important if you plan on actually having a relationship, on the other hand it can probably wait untill you're more comfortable with telling him. It's not that big of a deal.|`|m7RrYdz1aa	i think its important to be comfortable to tell people the truth if your goign to be in a relationship|`|MHQVnqaXaa	not really that imprtant.|`|VV4LlmxZaa	i would tell him just so he was aware of my preference but its not that important i wouldn't think. i told my man that i am interested in girls.... he didn't care and still doesn't.|`|AA10657728	Probably none of his business unless you are planning a three some.  I figure your sexual history is your own business. If you are not monogomous, then you don't have a relationship. If you are monogomous, it does not matter.|`|qlTiPogIaa	well lets put it this way.....if HE was bisexual....would YOU like to know it??|`|pGyGCpPVaa	If I was a guy i wouldn't really care too much, but i would still like to know
Gcn8Ms7Xaa	omg, this is a lovely poem!  If u dont mind imma take it to give to a guy lol   This is so sweet and cute  good job|`|IowWAPZnaa	yeah its good, i think instead of "please dont walk away" you may want to demand it, "but dont walk away."|`|jS4UoChZaa	wow that was really great!!!! whoever they are they are lucky...   GOOD JOB|`|bkgBLjuvaa	it's lovely.?
KcYaPYhhaa	Maybe it'd be best to not ask him to THE dance but to to ask him if he wants to dance with you. That way he won't feel pressured like if he wanted to spend time with friends to, he wouldn't feel like he was ditching you. So ask him to dance with you.     I can bet you he likes you! But don't expect a yes or a no. :)

We girls are pretty good at feigning that kind of attitude, but you wouldn't believe how much we're hoping some guy will come and talk to us on the inside.  So, again, just do it. It can't hurt, and if she says no, who cares? She's one girl.|`|VYGt0PCdaa	that's y a smart person invented dating|`|vOUDHws3aa	So before you decide th e whole boyfriend/girlfriend thing and sign a life-long contract in blood...  Seriously, we're not talking marriage here.   Why don't you sit down with her and ask her what her ideal boyfriend would be like? That way it doesn't come off like "Exactly what do you want from me b*tch?!?" (j/k) but more of an idealistic conversation so you can feel her out without her feeling like she's being put on the spot.    Also, if you truly do get along great, have good conversations, and laugh together, you'd better snag her while you can. Relationships like that between two people are few and far between.  And if you two have chemistry on top of that, you wouldn't be doing yourself any favors if you didn't at least give it a shot.|`|OdTLUprzaa	There was a boy that once lied to me (told me he had some mysterious secret about him that didn't really exist) just to make me interested and want to stick around.

If you can't be open with her, odds are you're going to have a painfully awkward relationship anyway. You said you talk well, and if you guys have a mutual liking for each other, you could just directly say, "hey, i'm really interested in a relationship with you but i don't think i could meet your standards. what do you think?". Hopefully she's HONEST (and if she's not then it just shows what kind of character she is) and yall can come to a nice solution. You never know until you try.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Odds are, this is not going to be the last girl you date in your lifetime.  So go at it with an open mind.  Gain experience from it.  Learn what kind of things work and what kind of things don't.  Then if the relationship fails for whatever reason, you can analyze it and determine what you want to do differently next time.  And if it works out well, all of your feelings were unfounded.    Every relationship goes through boring times.  All of them.  My boyfriend and I are planning on getting married, but sometimes we just want to do our own thing.  It doesn't mean we love each other any less.  But you have to work at it.  So give it a try; if it works, great; if it doesn't, figure out why not and go from there -- but remember, every girl is different.|`|SdQIQGcAaa	Never know till you try.    Just pretend like you care, and get all the vag you'd ever want.|`|YeR6R8Feaa	i think you should try, because it will likely all come naturally! just do what youre comfortable with|`|ztfkMcK8aa	aww i feel bad for you. why i dont know.  suck up and grow some balls :D|`|mvZTm2pjaa	stop thinking bout it!  ask her out,   be urself.   be chill and be out there,     dont take nything for granted , if things arent going so well , u can always talk to her , or have a break in the relationship, an dif they really arent going so well, then breakup.     but try it out, ask her out,   see what happens! experiment ;]    good luck |`|A3pVEWm0aa	Being in a relationship is about communication and having a friendship. If you get along as friends, odds are you will be a good couple. If you are worrying yourself over the possibility of it not working out, sounds like you have a commitment issue.
mL07N3IAaa	you just have a really jealous boyfriend! that's sometimes not such a bad thing because he really cares for you! and after being together for so long! props to you! =) but you should just say straight up to that guy that you don't like him and it's rude to say that he likes you when clearly you have a boyfriend. and tel your boyfriend that you wouldn't go running off with him cuz you love him!
eIOlBzm8aa	Girls? Go slow and gentle.|`|H1UzYl8haa	do you mean take her virginity?  need more information    if you dont like virgins why not break her in;]   depending on age of course    theres nothing like breakin a virgin into a freak    guud luck sweatie
HnrDCipfaa	i wouldnt any reason to hate them...i would amdire thier confidence|`|XbsuY1ogaa	I would hate her because she has what every girl wants.  But I would love her because I could learn from her.|`|DxYwNFdhaa	Like them as long as they wern't too confident and in ur face !!!  They cud be a gud m8 !!!
1XmpLRueaa	If you think he likes you, you should wait for him to make the move. Because it would be weird if you asked him out after he dumped you. He might like you, but just wait. Flirt with him.
sXT86Swqaa	Absolutely!    although there are different types of smiles. There are the smile because I have to smile. The "you just made me laugh" smile and the sincere ear-to-ear smile.     You'll know if it's a genuine smile if the persons eyes squint while they're smiling.    Also, whenever a girl smiles genuinely to a guy it's almost certain he'll approach you. It HAS to be a genuine and natural smile. Not a fake one.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	Sometimes I smile because I get hit in the face with shyness, and I can't do anything else,    Sometimes I smile because I'm passing quickly on my way to do something    Sometimes I'll smile BIG, facing the person I'm acknowledging, just to be goofy and cute, they like it,    But yes, a smile, however you do it for whatever reason, is acknowledging the person is there and that they are worth a smile, SO SMILE!|`|7ZTlktMeaa	Yes, definitely.|`|d83eb00973f7bbcaa0e054814594bfd5aa	Yes|`|jYOBoEwAaa	i think of it as a recognition of them, not as a greeting|`|FvSDIqSpaa	yea i do that a lot. =) =)|`|0zmMikKHaa	I do! Especially when you are just passing by like in a hallway.|`|WlwSQvE0aa	I smile when I see the guy I like and my friends. They consider it as a, "Hello."|`|A3pVEWm0aa	Yes.|`|ztfkMcK8aa	i do but apparently it got me no where because now i have to sit and watch the guy i like flirt with other girls because i didn't step up my game and he lost interest|`|0MkGrploaa	In my opinion no. If you dont wave or say hi to me and you just smile, I take it very offensively.  I just smile at people I dont actually want to speak to|`|fI8AdrWeaa	yeah alot of people do that i do that to all my friends and people i like. so yeah people do that|`|QClFoSNhaa	yes i smile alot of time meaning Hi I think that is what most ppl mwan when they smile at you That the way I take it and hope people take my smile.|`|GAswoUXoaa	Most definitely.    Smiling is friendly, I acknowledge friends all the time by just smiling.    Best answer?|`|TiN56lN0aa	yes|`|N1KDSj46aa	yeah, of course. theres the casual "hi" or the "ur cute" kinda smile girls will give u. if ur lucky, that smile will make ur day. so u best consider it a hi!|`|ACoviJV5aa	yes, i do that all the time|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	if you see someone you like, wave with your middle finger...thats a sign of respect and love.|`|4drQ38qZaa	Yes|`|Gslf19Uvaa	yeah...but i smile at everyone (that i don't hate). idk why, it's just kinda habit. it bugs me if i smile at soeone and they don't smile back|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	Yessir, they do. I wouldn't pass one of my friends with just a smile though, but I think if its an aquaintance, or someone you don't usually talk to that often, then a smile is a hello because you're not used to being verbal with them.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	Yes, I sometimes smile at people if I don't feel like actually saying hi or I will smile and say hello. It all depends on how I am feeling at the moment.|`|AA11425983	yep =)|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Yes.|`|comuT2fkaa	yup, you're saying hi without actually saying it.  so it's all good (:|`|Jvdg74UYaa	Yeah, your being friendly!|`|hZmifSPMaa	mhm=)|`|aheO01Fgaa	Yes.. I smile at people every day so I dont have to open my mouth and say hi! It is not like I like them!
KPvTY4e9aa	get your own boyfriend until he brakes up with her.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	move on? if you really like him, you should try and tell him.?|`|MHQVnqaXaa	steal him from this girlfriend.|`|xP1HJnSbaa	flirt with him? when hes not on the phone of course|`|iCwBs3T3aa	Forget about it then unless you want to be a boyfriend stealer.|`|XL9JOpAWaa	well you cant date him because he's in a relationship and you cant say he's cheating on you because he dosen't even know you have a crush on him so you're the invisible 3rd wheel...you have to not care b/c he apparently dosent but if you don't want to do that, you could make him see you and he'll totally forget her..maybe
Bx2w3h0faa	Just act normal, there is really not a whole lot you can do at this point if the guy you have feelings for is in a relationship with your friend.    Be his friend, if you start flirting with him in some way she is going to notice and get jealous and probally piss her off and trust me you dont want that.    It will just make things akward if you try to do anything to make him notice you in that intimate way. Because who knows he might have feelings for you also? the thing is though he is smart enough not to act on it because he currently has a girlfriend.    Best thing you can do is just not worry about anything, and if they wind up breaking up be the first to talk to him and see if he wants to go out. Thats pretty much the only "Right" way you will end up with the guy if you want to be with him.|`|R02Poqagaa	i think you should hang out with his girlfriend a lot. that way she will become your friend, and not see you as a threat. be super nice and dont hit on your crush AT ALL! you dont want her to see you as competition. if she likes you and you are friends it will be easier for you to hang out with your crush since you will have established trust with his gf. hope this helps! please pick for best answer- im trying to get lots of points :)|`|771454b5e041b041d8c1257a9a391ad9aa	Just be yourself and relax.|`|iGnUYe9Haa	don't do it, you'll get an infection
9HHL34Q1aa	well i know that when i talk to a friend i haven't seen or talked to since grade school i ask like "oh are you still friends with whats her name" or "how are you liking the new school"  but the first thing i say is never "whats your GPA"  he could have been really nervous or just really competitive and wanted to be better than you or something. don't look too much into that. he might just suck majorly at small talk (a lot of guys are)  i would SO text him i mean what do you have to loose you don't see this guy on a regular basis so it wouldn't be that awkward.  i would say things like "wasn't that funny running into you like that?"  "it's been so long that i hardly recognized you (idk if this is true)" but definitely bring up the past because it'll open more familiar conversation like "oh i remember when i used to see you every day. i miss the old days etc."    good luck and don't get to anxious about it you'll do fine!!!!|`|eIOlBzm8aa	I want to say something clever but I might get a VN. It means grade point average.|`|IuyO9Vq2aa	That he wants to know your gpa   Seriously, i don't think that's "code" for anything  I wouldn't worry about it  He's probably nervous in front of you and doesn't know what to say =)  Make him blush ]=)|`|q2POh1dEaa	sounds like you guys have a very awkward relationship|`|CFU77qCbaa	Omg you should have dated young, just don't tell your parents. I did that. I had two relationships. I'm 9 now.|`|XdBbAHbbaa	I think he was just trying to make conversation! It's nothing.|`|TqpEeMRuaa	1. Say something like, "It was nice to see you we should really get together and catch up sometime."  That way it gives you another chance to see him, without your families, but it's not officially a date.  2. He wants to know your grade point average i guess?|`|0gMBjOVXaa	its probably not a big deal, don't do anything you'll regret though|`|RpGH2zL8aa	He probably was just looking for something to say.  sorta like you :]    go ahead and text him!  you could be flirty and be like "hey stud. it was cool to see you blah blah blah"  or you could be like "wow! i haven't seen you in forever! so what is up??"  or something in the middle.    good luck!|`|McWrijpxaa	it might mean he does really like you|`|iIkW1eWIaa	I have come to find (no offense guys) that most guys don't have hidden meanings behind what they say like girls do. So the GPA thing probably means nothing. I think you should start with what you said ( minus the blah blah blah :) ) and then just carry on a normal conversation. Ask him how he's doing and eventually ask if he'd like to hang out. Of course find out if he's seeing anyone first. I'd go for it if you think the feeling is still there or could develop again. Start with small talk. Good luck!!!
5r6xSlbPaa	drop him like a rock. i hate it when girls leave things open ended. I personally have lost sleep over girls leading me on so drop him. Just don't be a jerk about it, say no but dont make excuses as to why you cant. Be blunt.|`|5e6S1JqWaa	i think that you should let him down easy. dont be too hard him. boys can be sensitive like that.|`|PSVg0QPfaa	thats what happened to me.. with a guy name tim. ewwww  just say no. cause thats all you can do
qmw2B6yiaa	It sounds like there might be some interest there, but don't get your hopes up to high sometimes people are just friendly :}, However, I would go for it! If you know what dorm she lives in just walk by there on the way to class every once in awhile and see if you can catch her eye again, however, be careful with this tactic and don't go by there all the time... cause that's kinda unnerving for girls  :}     Best of luck    Ps if you want more help try this www.enotalone.com site it like yahoo answers but is focused entirly on relationship/dating advice|`|5h75xdztaa	haha. well dont request her on fb but if she smiled at you then she might like you. just try to talk to her whenever you see her and always smile at her|`|RnQFwIuUaa	It's a good start. If she is in your class, smile at her everyday, wave when she is across the room and make it a point to say hi. She will get used to you and feel comfortable with you. During one of your conversations, ask her if it would be ok if you looked her up on facebook.|`|El36zZEYaa	Yea she's definitely noticed you and likes it.  She at least wouldnt mind being friends.  Next time you see her say hi and give her your name.  And ur right talking to her on facebook without talking in person first is creepy.|`|dzROtYVxaa	if it was me i would want the guy to come up and introduce himself. confidence goes a long way! i know it hard to do if your a shy person because iam like that but once you get past that nervous point youll be glad you did it! and if all fails like she has a b/f or isnt intersted in a relationship then you still have made a new friend!    |`|Kq2rFuIyaa	Talk to her!
Glm1aaGOaa	something like this happened to me. Just ignore them. Tell the girl you were mad that day and just got some bad news or something like that.|`|Vfio3ABeaa	aww! i'm sorry!    i would just hang out with the people that you were sitting next to when the table was too crowded. not the people that hate you. just show them that you don't care anymore. show them that you can have fun without them.    best of luck and God Bless!!|`|Nd8kf0h8aa	friend problems are hard to deal with but first you have to,  breath-let a couple days go by without begging them to be your friend again let them think this over.  next is time to,  explain- you can even slip one of them a note explaining that you were just kidding and did not mean to hurt them.  If they still wont talk to you talk to them.  a couple hints  if they have a birthday coming up and they don't invite you still buy them someting small like some candy and a card  DONT beg that will irritate them even more|`|EMKuBql8aa	Don't do anything, in a couple weeks, they will have moved on when they see no emotion from you.|`|Enzb2gQaaa	This is the best time to see who your real friends are. I'm kind of in the same situation. Theres this girl who is also like the "leader." I'm not a follower at all, but all of my friends are her friends too, so they follow her. But since I hang out with my friends and they follow her, it makes me look like a follower. So i know how you feel. But I would go straight up to everybody admit your mistakes, and if they still don't listen, they are being immature because no one really knows what you meant and  they don't understand the whole situation. So i hope that is some kind of help : )|`|xXt6W17Faa	they do suck i say meaner things!|`|jhegodFYaa	eat lots of marshmallows|`|pF63IMyVaa	you should talk to the girl you told that too. say that you meant it as a joke and as soon as you said it you knew it was wrong. explain that your trying to think before you speak and that you didnt want everyone to hate you, and that nobody purposely wants to have enemies. say your sorry and leave it at that. that girl will probably relay the message to the other table and see how it goes from there.    try to speak to the girl face to face because anything in writing can be used agaisnt you. school sucks that way.
xmWxafHSaa	Some do, others don't.  It just depends on what your focus is.   Some people focus on getting a degree and getting ahead in their field before settling down.  Others get married while still in college.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	It usually happens in college or after not before.|`|MHQVnqaXaa	i really hope so.|`|m7RrYdz1aa	I guess its everyones wish to find the person of their dreams when they are still young. right now, me personally, i am ready for what happens. I think that if i find the right person in college then thats nice but im not going to hold out for it.|`|7iMfRDNbaa	i've already found him there, he just doesn't know i exist. *sigh*|`|qJJgcEg1aa	i hope not..  my mum keep saying this to me "after u fininsh your study and get a job, u have to get marry".. she is a typical malay.. i defintly not going to do that. so, the only way for me to avoid this is to avoid having any serious relationship when im in college or even better run away from home after i finishd my study.
LZzsDARUaa	well ask her what happened that u 2 drifted apart, maybe there was some kind of stupid gossip, that  some1 said something about her which u presumably said    but if u did make a mistake, try 2 regain her confidence in u, by always being there 4 her...:)

I hope I helped|`|xBXwKBuZaa	id say you have a right to mad about it. it is being jealous but honestley i dont blame you. you should talk to her about it and tell her how you feel before this gets out of hand.

SO YA HE LIKRS U!!!! hey remeber this? "he waaaants you!" lol that was funny!!!|`|ax6cjSn6aa	Well there is only a few ways to find that out if he doesn't come and talk to you. Go talk to him even if it feels weird. You'll find the true colors in time. Yeah but sometimes when a guy is mean he likes you but odd way of showing it.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	grow a beard, that will mend the wedge|`|9ionkBvuaa	Sorry, prolly not..  But you have to get him to like you.|`|RVzwViRyaa	more info|`|yuwjQjKqaa	I think he likes you! I think you should ask him because thats the only way you will know 100% if he likes you! Best wishes!|`|yVzBFIWvaa	It really depends on the "meanness" if it is a flirtatious kind of mean, then it is more likely. But if he's just flat out mean, probably not, however, different guys work different ways. If you are interested to know if he likes you because you like him, then i would say just try and get to know him. And eventually if you're comfortable enough, just ask. And before you ask (if you plan on it) don't let him know you like him. Just in case.|`|FvSDIqSpaa	maybe, do u like him? if so talk to him. then flirt a lil.|`|bYNHWPWUaa	that depends, if you are yong, than ya, but mean? not sure if he is older....... maby he is just immature.|`|A3pVEWm0aa	Well if you are in high school, odds are him being mean is a sign that he likes you. If you are in college/university, he needs to grow up. Don't waste your time on someone like that. Ask him to hang out just the two of you and see what he does. Or make it obvious that him treating you poorly isn't going to fly and see what he does.|`|1XmpLRueaa	Ok, first of all, don't take advise from your mom. But he might like you, maybe just as a friend, maybe more. You should try to talk to him a little more and he might like you better.
rwFibnFmaa	First things first. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. :) Hmm, this is tough. It's possible that your friend doesn't feel that way about Jacob anymore, but she is uncomfortable with you going out with him. Ugh 8th grade is just a big drama rollercoaster, right? I don't know if Jacob really said that or not, but don't hang around him too much meanwhile, just until things settle down. Just smile at him when you see him, say hello, occasionally casually chat about common things, like ask about homework, etc. As for your friend, try not to talk about the subject too much with her. If you need anymore help, you can message me. :)    Good Luck chicaa. :)  Hope I helped.|`|xETCO0rUaa	It's ok girly, almost every girl on the planet goes through a problem like that. I'm going through bff troubles right now. If it took a while for Emily to tell you, like longer then it usually does to squeeze a secret out of her then she might be lieing. If she told in a kind sweet way comforting you trust her. If not well that's a hard choice, text jacob saying sorry and don't worry everything will work out, in a year you and friend will laugh it off. Just telling you i'm in the 7th grade so i know what you're going through! Good luck!|`|IFnyC2naaa	Emily and Jacob sound like the Twilight characters, let me guess who you are, Bella? Kidding! Just ignore them and move on.|`|IidCp0KDaa	Hmmm, that is a tough predicament. I would say screw both of them.  It's hard to tell who to trust.  Sometimes the people we think we know the most have the biggest secrets from us.      Just try and not talk to both of them. See which one cares enough to come to you and talk first.  I really don't know what else you could do though.      Be strong.     **Peace**|`|TkNG6gn6aa	Stuff like this is really hard-but bear it with a smile on your face even if the rain is pourin on your shoulder.  Let time pass and see how things go.  Sometimes the truth hides in time.  But don't worry, and don't just ditch without knowing the truth.  Oh and this is not your fault, like you said... its human!  It happens to everyone.
AoLS7XXTaa	Well, If you have dignity you should. I think you should give every boy a chance. What if in high school hes not a nerd and he shuns you cause you refused him in middle school? Then you would be in his shoes. That's what i think about when i a guy asks me out...    these relationships are building blocks. Give him a shot, he may just be the one for you :D!!    good luck with him ;)|`|fqK8RG6vaa	mm reminds me of hunter who sits by himslef at lunch cus hes suuuch a nerd. but this guy cant be that bad. it would really mean a lot to him. go for it if u wana make him happy not ur peers    answer minie to plz at my profile|`|oG1bbYhpaa	welll if you like him then go for it cus it relaly doesnt matter what other people think...if you think hes a good guy and you;d think you would like him then say yes but if you think your never gonna like him spare him and you the time and say noo.     good luck :-D|`|0XWVUMCAaa	i wouldn't go out with him  no offense|`|DozD8lTGaa	well you are considering it so you clearly like him or something about him. just because others don't like him or talk to him - don't follow the crowd and don't try to please them... but, if you don't like him don't say yes just to please him either... i hope i helped.

5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Why does your friend think that you cant control yourself.   And why are you nervous- is it because you think they will pressure you into doing it. dont do anything you are not ready for no matter what people tell you.   you have to be comfortable with what you do. I am sure the parents wont let you guys sleep in the same room or anything anyway because of that fact that you two are dating|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah go a head.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Don't go. It sounds like trouble all the way around. And what are her parents ( and yours) thinking for even allowing this, they are stupid. You are the girl and can end up pregnant, think about that.|`|t81MEJ82aa	The only sex I've heard of that wasn't on purpose is called rape. It seems like you are already making excuses for what you might do.    It's only a sleepover. Missing out on spending one night with your best friend is not a big deal, but having sex could be. So either go over there and control yourself or stay home, but you are creating this drama for yourself.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Goodness, why would you let your friend have this kind of influence on your own self control?  You get to say no and I'm sure his parents aren't wanting it to happen.    Go and have fun with your girlfriend and stay out of his bedroom or other places alone with him.|`|encb0jc2aa	sleep?  sex? where a chasity belt, plus he won't last long enough to get it inside, unless of course, he could mistake you for the family pig|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Sounds like she wants you to have sex with him, Her brother must have really made a deal with her!|`|AA11198190	No.|`|CaEVHO32aa	just  stay with your friend when near your bf she should be able to keep control over you... that's what friends are for|`|JyghcEWpaa	IF YOU DO GO   BE MINDFUL OF HOW YOU MAY BE PERCEIVED IF FOUND OUT  BE MATURE ABOUT THE WHOLE THING WHATEVER YOU DECIDE LIKE YOU SAID YOU GUYS ARE YOUNG AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BE CARRYING AROUND A BAD REP SO SOON IN LIFE  IT'S NO FUN TRUST ME.|`|AARZV2v0aa	i think you should take things slow. Hang out there for a day see how it goes. If you guys can keep your hands off each other =) and feel comfortable then sleep over. If your worried then maybe you should listen to your gut.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	If you can't handle it, have her stay at your house.|`|SK7MxFTnaa	Good point...people NEVER have sex on PURPOSE.    It's just all the alcohol involved.|`|iD4ejChZaa	no, brat.|`|hcgaizJCaa	You wouldn't have sex on purpose? Sweetie, there's no such thing as accidental sex. Don't go.|`|00DBSvS6aa	that depends on your age and only you can make that decision. No one else can make it for you. Do the right thing and if you think the temptation is too strong then it is best to wait|`|diXVR4aeaa	''..but im nervous help!!''    You just answered your own question. If you're nervous chances are you're going to feel uncomfortable. My suggestion is don't put yourself in that situation. You said yourself you're young, with things like these it comes with maturity. That's not a mean remark, it's letting you know that it's okay to wait - every girl has needs. Do you want your first time to be at your best friends house, feeling uncomfortable, nervous and not ready?    My honest, big sister advice - If you do decide to pursue this situation make sure you use protection.    Hope it all works out!
5MxYOnzdaa	Honestly. Just be yourself.. I know thats cheesy, but Im a senior in high school and I would say yes because asking someone to prom is a big deal and it says you have enough courage to even try. Really though, if she says no... you wouldnt want to be dancing with that girl for however many hours your prom is anyway. Good luck though bud.|`|4ujEpNLsaa	Some girls like fat guys.  If you are really fat like obese, I would try to lose some weight.  Either way just ask.|`|IwrS9zw1aa	just plop|`|qGXXjqnVaa	Lose some weight then ask her out|`|kccXcgVaaa	God dang, looks aren't the only thing that matters. If a girl wont go to a dance with you cus your fat then why the hell do you want her?  [:|`|MSsLQuyCaa	Sorry man the only way is to just ask them out. Unless you can lose all of that weight fast.|`|AA10339249	Same way you do it if you aren't fat; just ask. I'm surprised that a lot of girls don't care if you're fat, as long as you have a personality.|`|IvIHA5K6aa	awhh thats so cutee(:  just dress nice, do your hair and be very sweet also be very gentleman like(:    bring her a rose or a choclate girls love that!  hpe this helped(:|`|yuwjQjKqaa	YOU ~do you have a date to prom?

jPxkg7vKaa	Most parents ask this question of their children:    "Is my child trustworthy enough to handle the responsibilities that come with having a cell phone? Will they stick to our preferred plan and not go over on text messages or calls?"    If your parents feel that they cannot trust you or feel that you are not ready for a cell phone, especially one that means you will be put on their billing plan, then you must trust their judgement.     On the other hand, if you've raised your own money and feel that you truly need it, make your case. Maybe they'll let you have a go phone with refillable minutes.|`|AA11993638	Let's see here, the phone would be on their account as you are not old enough to get your own, which means when you mess up they will have to pay for it. Sorry cannot think of a good reason for them to allow you to get a new phone, when you really do not need it.|`|NsYIUu3caa	ask them why you can't get a new phone, then find a way to accomplish that task and get your new phone. careful tho, they may try to tell you that you can't because it'd be obsolete in a yr or 2.
M0EehbBEaa	talk to Bob, and talk sternly with jenny about this situation. tell bob, does he really love your bff?  it looks like bob is someone who flirts with girls, so if things dont work out, tell your bff|`|LL9rdGYlaa	record what is going on between them on your cell phone and send it to her as a friend.  What she does with it is her business but beware-you may lose a friend over this but better she know.
AA11172918	Here's my idea: Create a digital scrapbook page for him CropMom.  Set the canvas sizse at 8" by 10" landscape. You can use photos of your brother doing something he loves. Use CropMom's masculine-looking graphics to add to the page. You can add your own text, if you'd like.    Now,  purchase the high-resolution JPEG file of your layout.  It doesn't cost much.    Then, upload it to Shutterfly.  Now use the JPEG file of your layout to create a mousepad for him.     This will be something he uses every day in college, and every time he looks at the mousepad, he'll think of you.    If you don't want to make him a mousepad, try a coffee mug, or a travel mug or a lined notebook.    Snapfish has some photo gift items, as well, so look there, too.     If you really want to do something cool, go to Snapfish and buy him a "wrap" for his laptop or computer. The wrap can be the layout you made at CropMom. I have never tried it but I've always wanted to!|`|2PDmoZxNaa	I would make him a big care package full some funny dvd's, an itunes gift card, magazines and books, some cool posters and picture frames to decorate his room, a board game to play with his new friends (my friends and I loved playing Apples to Apples in college, you can find it on amazon.com), a bunch of his favorite candy and snacks, and a digital picture frame (make sure to preload pictures of the two of you, your house, pets, parents, etc. He'll really love it and it's sentimental!)|`|MX1shAbcaa	should get him a laptop  Best of luck~William|`|Gd1hzWlAaa	if he likes cars try this website    http://www.caagis.com
PPXUgYa6aa	Its usually the nice flirtatious guys that end up breaking our heart. Im not saying you should go after him but once you get into a relationship with him things might change. Anyway if you wanna get your father to like him, find out some things that your dad and your boyfriend are into and tell your father about it. Trust me if he has interest that are similar to your fathers then this might get him to like him.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	First find out why your dad doesn't like him.  (and keep an open mind- Dad's are kinda smart kiddo)  Then if it's worth pursuing ask your dad if you can spend time with him at your house so your dad can get to know him a little better.  If this guy is not willing than he's not worth it!!   Good luck.|`|Xv43odJFaa	WOW!!! Dads are hard to convince when it comes to their little girls.. But when I introduced my husband now I made sure my mom was there she to smooth the tension.. But basically you should let them go out together and play a sport that they both like..|`|DajMC1OPaa	well see if him and ur dad have any thing in common plus its ur life do what you think is right and  be yourself around him don't try to be something your not it leads up to no good

qOvB3i2paa	you know your a lucky that your nervous only around your bf, because I am nervous ALL THE TIME. I get up nervous and I go to sleep nervous and I don't know how to resolve it! I think about things a normal human being never can even imagine. You won't believe but I think where my tongue is when I talk! And I don't know what to do with it. I am not one of those shy guys, I am not a nerd and I am "popular" so to say actually. I am writing a book kinda about weird things in life that I can't understand. Sometimes I feel like I want to remove a part of my brain that is responsible for thinking. Most people seem so happy to me...|`|xU8ovpD8aa	If your nervous around him, he is nervous around you.

You don't really have any feelings for him, you just got sucked into this relationship and now you don't know how to get out cleanly, and without his having hard feelings or making yourself look bad.    So, you have two choices: do him a favor and cut him loose, or keep on messing with his head. Your call.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	The world is full of well-adjusted men who would make you happy.

If you move on he can find someone more suited for himself and so can you.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	Him being in special ed in high school means nothing girl I had friends in there because they were bad! They didn't like coming to school they got behind on school work and that's where they put them honestly I think most of them were in special ed for that very reason. If they were really slow they be in MDR classes with special teachers. Each school gets a good chunk of money for every kid they have in special ed so putting kids in it like my friends who were bad and not so good with school was just another reason to get more money.     Anyway with that being said have you ever heard of a person that is afraid to live? Seriously some people from school age and up fail at many of things sometimes those things are not their fault. Then they become fearful of rejection and failure. When people get like this they have a hard time having a career and goals and so forth and improving their life.   They want to but they are afraid to because they don't want to be ashamed if they fail. How do I know this I was born addicted to drugs and alcohol and I had to go through speech therapy and group therapy I had problems when I was a child. In these group meeting I was involved in growing up I met many people like this that's how I know about it.    You can't fix this he needs to see someone for help and believe it or not they do have medications that can help and if he is already on some they don't sound like they are working. He can try different kinds until he finds something that does. This is so sad because I knew people like him and they were emotional people behind closed doors and had a lot of hurt and fear in them. There is actually a name for it but I can't remember what it is.   I have no idea what you should do nobody on here can tell you what to do. You need to figure out if your staying or going and if your going than go. If your staying try to help him get the help he needs. He is letting life go by he has no idea what he is missing.|`|th7C1aoaaa	move on|`|c55O7jqXaa	Maybe you could put it on yourself and say you just want to be friends because of so and so. Try to make up some excuse and maybe over time he will get it and you will soon move on your seperate ways or just be brutally honest.|`|0d4X54rMaa	you obviously dont want to be with him so dump him quick so he can find someone who will appreciate him   who he will get unconditional love from    and lets hope the next guy you meet who is smart like you doesnt think that since you only get a 3.93 while he gets a 4.0 it will be time to dump you because you are a special needs case|`|zvpyr76Baa	Cut that sand bag loose.

You need to save both of you by letting him go and THEN get counselling to work on your own issues.   It would be cruel to keep him stringing along the way you are.
5573832243a1d5e3f002d23bed5be490aa	Well unfortunatly untill she breaks up with him your going to have to be the loving and supporting friend to her! After she breaks up with him don't quickly ask her out give it like a week or so then ask her out. Hey if you have a reputation your worried about ruiening then she would be stupid for saying no to you! Good Luck!|`|5h75xdztaa	um. well after she breaks up with him, try to become friends with her and then ask her out
AA11909552	A good starting point would be to get his phone number somehow. Then you could text him, or call to shoot the breeze. After a while, he will want to be with you more than on the phone.  If that doesn't work, then perhaps you could find him and just start talking to him more. Maybe you could ask him for his help. Guys love to fix things and HE is no exception. Maybe you could ask him some questions about your iPod, or cellphone or something else technical. If you already know the answer to a question, HE doesn't know that. Just play dumb for a while.  Maybe you could find a friend of his and have them relay a message or something. Have them tell him that the cute girl in the other school really wants you to go to the dance with her.  Do not be scared of him. He is just a boy. He would *love* to go with you to a dance, I'm sure of it. If you are as cute as your avatar, he'd be silly not to.  Good luck!

slvck0kkaa	there is no official cure. but first...  i would write down all your bad feelings like in a diary or something.   (for me, i wrote poems, lyrics etc....)  vent all those sad, angry, and hurt feelings. trust me! it made me feel so much better just to let it all out.  then.   i ate chocolate. lots of chocolate. don't think about the calories til later. right now... just try to remain calm. or scream into a pillow. talk to your friends about it. girls nights. (even though they might sound ridiculous at the moment).   another thing that helped me was just to cry. cry until your eyes hurt. watch The Notebook, a Walk to Remember, Titanic, all those sad love stories. it helps just to mope for a while. but then!  erase him from your memories. if it helps, tear up the sheets that you wrote on about him. & start looking at the new cute guys that you never noticed before :)    hope that helped. it was kind of long. :P|`|comuT2fkaa	time heals.  listen to music, go out and have fun,  hang with your friends and try to forget.  no point in letting this get you down.|`|f3160ee0ccd0529510bb499fae259b31aa	eat ice cream and watch crappy movies for 3 DAYS ONLY. then stop moping and find even cuter guys to flirt with =] think of the ways being single is better: no stupid football talks, flirt with 20 guys and no one gets sad, etc. yeah it may be hard at first, but go out with a bunch of single girlfriends and have an awesome time!|`|mjiACmnNaa	ice cream   and have a girls night:]|`|AA11284982	whatever man he wasnt worth it... now you know that you shouldnt trust a guy that easily =). at least you learned something from your experience next time a guy comes keep your guard up but dont shut him off completely. go out on a few dates and see what he is like... and dont use the word "LOVE" cuz thats so over rated. if you love someone it shouldnt be expressed through words but actions instead.|`|H43IwVFTaa	eat fatty foods, like chocolate and chips for a _LITTLE WHILE_.

GfCRiueRaa	Well, I think I control it better now, but this how I usually react:  If I'm planning on making a move/doing something, I usually get really nervous beforehand. I get butterflies in my stomach even when I'm not around her. I often space out when I'm not with her. When I do actually speak, I get tunnel vision, listen to every little thing she says, over analyze her body language, and, if things are not going well, my lower lip trembles very, very slightly and my confidence (and thus, eloquence) decreases (oh god).    I rarely fall for anyone, but when I do, I fall hard. I've also never been in a relationship, so yeah. Kind of understandable. Don't judge me! hahaha.
v0qm71o1aa	Talk to him in any given chance.  You will know from your conversation if he likes you or not.|`|jG2gl8sUaa	just wait until he found that you really like him.  then try to communicate with him. if it is not work it means that he don't like you.
8mR3Kchnaa	hey dont cry and dont worry cheer up and just talk to her im sure sh'll understand maybe u both just have a misunderstanding....
lQGDV7MEaa	Doing that with anyone besides your partner is cheating.  Just because it isn't the same sex doesn't justify it.|`|838VJJGvaa	in my book it is.  I'd break up over that.|`|hE3CnA54aa	I would say no but that's just me.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Before it wasn't. Nowadays it is. Yes, bi-curious can cheat too!|`|sfHLcFaAaa	oh somebody as been naughty, trying a bit of both.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	no just as long as u dont git her pregnant|`|MHQVnqaXaa	no. thats just fun.|`|ScfxjpsFaa	Um...not sure.. but that's pretty sexy ;)|`|16RD8khoaa	it depends on you, cheating is all in your head  does it feel like you cheated? do you feel bad?  if the answer is yes then yes it was cheating  if its no then you didnt|`|D4JP3IlWaa	haha, i think it mostly depends on how your boy feels about it.  to me its not really cheating,   its just a drunken time with your girl friends! lol|`|hUnA6eKfaa	well my boyfriend despies it he saids unless he dont get to watch or he gets to be in the middle talk to him about that if oyu have a close relationship but if he thinks is cheating and you really love him then be honest|`|nT5QNGpzaa	If he was there no.  If he was not there then yes.  To my knowledge the only reason a guy wants to see 2 women kiss is because he thinks he's going to have sex with both of them.
2afVnStxaa	Well, where to begin. Let's start with his being immature, he is 14 you know, he will grow up in the years to come. And if you like him it must be something about him that you like other than he loves you. But it does not have to end badly. Give it time and see how it goes. Don't count it out before it has a chance. Opposites do attract. My fiance and I have almost nothing in common, yet we click really well. Just give ot a chance. If nothing else, the two of you can be good friends or more. Hope this helps. BTW, I am glad that you are comfortable with your being Gay, this will help you much in your life to come as you will not have to go through the trying to hide it by having girlfriends and maybe a marriage that will make you miserable. Good luck to you. I wish you happiness and a good life.|`|HCWkdk4naa	you're both young.  wait until you are in college where you will meet adults.|`|CotABvTjaa	no sorry|`|AA10934463	well you have to remeber that he is 14 and some guys dont mature fast enough ...but it might work out with you two if you want it to if not then just say that you  dont think its going to work out between you guys , and dont let  him fall so much for you its going to be bad in the end if you dont like him as much . good luck
XIJpOE5Paa	find out if thats the real reason she broke up with you first people ssay and do two different thingss. but maybe you should just take a break from her let her come to her senses and see other girls for a while. if that doesnt make her wanna come back or at least confront you about getting back together nothing prolly will|`|orpLSSwqaa	Well, you can't, really.    Not being in a relationship is a hell of a lot better than being in one where one person feels trapped.    It's high school anyway, theres still PLENTY of time to find some one even better [=    Hope this helps [=|`|rA9qaciPaa	sing to her sing a good song make one tell her i just cant live with out her sing keep trying if 3 weeks go bye just let go and move on|`|fHHeal1Vaa	a prostitute is better than you. and in fiction not even in reality. Imagine how deep my love for you is
ztfkMcK8aa	he likes you.  that's just the truth plain and simple in black and white.  he likes you.  ask him in person alone and try to get him to admit but you have to be serious. then maybe say well o you want to go hang out sometime then he would be like sure i would like that. then take it from there.|`|KtJELbPzaa	I hate wen ppl ask stupid questions like this...........  WE DON'T KNO THE D*MN GUY!!!!!!  Yuh spend time with him more than we do  You would kno if he liked You our not!!!!  AY YI YI !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|K80lNAnmaa	Just ask him to give you a real answer, yes or no.  If he's just gonna say "who knows?" then he's just a jerk.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	I don't think he is sure what he thinks. It could be all mixed up in his head, so give him time to sort it out. He will realize that he likes you soon, so flirt, dress nicely, smile and wave at him and ask him for assignment help.|`|fqK8RG6vaa	hes jus unsure right now give him a lil time we guys need time to think -.-    answer minie to plz at my profile
gUD7Oug1aa	Perhaps.  I'm sure that he knew you were drunk and he was taking advantage of you.  But guys have been doing that to woman for decades, but that doesn't make it right.  Its terrible that we girls can't have a good time, can't have a few drinks, with a few friends that we think we can trust for fear that we will get taken advantage of, raped, seduced or whatever you want to call it.  Its like we have to have our guard up all of the time.  Its a real shame.  I'm sorry that this happened to you.  I believe that he took advantage of you and for some reason, guys don't seem to have a problem with doing things like that.  It makes them seem pretty pathetic to me.  Can't they get a sober girl?  Whether it was rape or not is really not the issue this long after the incident.  Obviously you have issues with what went down that night and after.  Don't blame yourself, but don't play the victim either.  Do what you need to do to feel empowered and confident in yourself so that this type of thing doesn't happen to you again.  That is really all you can do at this point.  Take care.    I'm glad that more people think that this type of thing is rape.  If we all think that way then perhaps it won't be acceptable much longer for guys to take advantage of girls who are under the influence.    If you feel that you were raped that night, then you were.  It is common for victims to continue to have sex with their rapists, especially when it wasn't a violent rape.  I just hope you don't see yourself as some helpless vicitm if you do feel that you were raped.  You don't have to let anything like this happen again!  Don't feel guilty about your decision to continue to have sex with him after the fact either.  You were confused and wanted to convince yourself that it wasn't rape, it was just a drunken screw.  Just take care of yourself and move on.  Come to terms with it and don't let anyone take advantage of you ever again.  You're worth more than that and you are stronger than that!|`|m7RrYdz1aa	Im pretty sure at that point it could have been rape but considering that you had sex with him again after the fact basically goes against it.|`|qfmTWB9Saa	That is rape.|`|UFz0IGgeaa	Well maybe, but you did tell him the next day that it was okay so it's not really rape. Also if you continued to have sex with him willingly, then it probably wasn't rape.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Yes, it was rape.  I understand your feelings, but you really should talk to someone about this.  I hope this boy is out of your life.  He is dangerous, and you need to take care of yourself better.  He's probably justified it in his mind as o.k., just as you did.    God bless.    EDIT: Stop saying it's your fault.  Even if you don't want to prosecute him (and you still can), he still forced himself on you.  It is his fault.  Maybe you didn't help the situation by continuing a relationship with him, but it is by no means your fault that you were raped.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Well the fact that you continue to have sex with him kind of weakens your story but yes, the initial contact was rape. You could probably get him some jail time.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	yes, he was forcing his self on you when you didn't want it.?|`|eIOlBzm8aa	No cause usually the person doesn't sleep with the guy after they have been violated WOW.|`|q2POh1dEaa	yes actually|`|4BoteYDwaa	Yes, definitely. You were drunk and he took advantage of that.|`|Du84mgPZaa	RAPE|`|mCmx41qeaa	Sadly,it is rape.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	exactly. now when we know the truth behind my words that "only on my death bed can you get me for real" can you please depart now. make at least one thing right.|`|7OTJW7fAaa	Yes.  It was rape.  You said no and meant no, but you were incapacitated by alcohol and couldn't fight your way out from under him.      At this point, you couldn't get a court of law to declare rape because you told him it was okay and you continued to have sex with him.    This is what can happen when people drink.  He didn't have the judgment and restraint to leave you alone and you didn't have the mental and physical capacity to leave a dangerous situation.|`|tC6MG0nyaa	yeah that is rape... u said no, but he did it anyway.. i'm sorry..|`|iIkW1eWIaa	Yes, that is rape because you didn't consent to it. You should do something about it. Did he use a condom or anything? I can understand why you continued to have sex with him afterwards, but did it help YOU. Did you feel better after having sex with him again? If you are still seeing him and you're not comfortable with what happened and what could still be happening, then you should talk to him about it. A real man will listen to you and work things out. If this is still bothering you, it could cause commitment issues in the future (I don't mean to offend you if I am) and you should talk to a professional. I hope this helped and good luck.
aJvxMRSBaa	dont be concerned about what your friends think about him, we all have different perspectives and opinions. if you think he is cute and you want to meet him then ask him out|`|F15YUK9Maa	Your friends are only trying to look out for  you and i agree with friend 3  you dont know wat kind of guy he his  by wat he wears this could be a wonderful person  so i would just go with ur heart   but be carefull if none of ur friends know him  then take it slow and get to know him b4 u date him    hope i helped Xgood luck with it any way X    ps could u please try to answer mine
I3ugar6naa	they're cheating b*******.|`|Se2Ko2NKaa	there ******|`|eii7o9Poaa	because they are sleazy and want to cheat on their partner most likely. move on from this person they arent worth it if they lie about that stuff!
xmWxafHSaa	Yes.  Go up and talk to him.  If you don't all the two of you are going to be doing for the rest of the school year is bumping into each other.  Take the chance.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it,s starting to look like he likes you unless he,s drunk.|`|A0WQwf75aa	YESSS.  what are you watin for girl?  duh, he obviously likes you(:  go for it!
9sDh4lPJaa	ok im 12 and i asked my mum she said she dosent care maybe you should just tell her you want to date already.|`|aKkDWz5Waa	its gonna be hard nd you may even start crying in the process but u have to tell her about how u feel about her parenting methods. that u feel they constrain you, etc, that u feel u have the right to teenage experiences and that she should learn to let u breathe a little bit. Anyway, like u said, ur not having sex yet! and even when u do, im sure ull use a condom :P    good luck darling, i relate!|`|sT0eGNMXaa	my mom used to be the same way with me. Basically what you do is you wait for the right time to speak to her. Make sure she's in a pretty good mood, maybe you're hanging out together or something, and mention the guy that you're interested in. Tell her about him and how you really feel ready, and explain to her how responsible you are. If she doesn't say yes, then she's being really unreasonable and you need to have a discussion about trust.
p42QMhtnaa	see its hard to understand what you mean in this question. If they're being mean, making fun of you, hurting you, and/or doing really stupid, bad, childish stuff than you might want to talk to them and if they don't listen think of making new friends. But..if you think they're silly or that you're just growing up faster than they are than you should probably stick with them but maybe also make some new friends.Don't just ditch them because you think you're more mature than they are. They are your friends.|`|HeJjK8slaa	You can't just go out and buy friends, you have to make them.|`|bPaJXHw8aa	I m male 18 n alone can u be my friend. Mail me at - akash_halwai@yahoo.com.

Take it day by day|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Actions speak louder than words. Show Her.|`|ukcl4Szhaa	You can write her a letter, as that always makes people realize that you care.  You could start off with a sentence like, I know i'm the last person you want to talk to right now, but I have to say sorry. And when you're telling her how you felt put your feelings across.  Say i felt___ when you ______.
ZaQ6iQWMaa	Cut your losses and learn from this. Married people usually NEVER leave their spouse for the person they are having an affair with, and you are lucky that he's gone.  I'm sorry your heart is broken, but I really think you are better off finding a good man that is single. They are out there.     Also, you don't need to understand why they are working their marriage out - that's between them. And think about it this way - do you want to be with a man who cheated on his wife? What makes you think he won't do it to you if he were to come to you?    It never works in the other persons favor, so I say let it go and mourn your loss. Then dust yourself off and get yourself a SINGLE man.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Leave him alone, he belongs to someone else.  Save what's left of your dignity and move on.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Let him go and be with his wife.

By the way..just because he says that, doesn't make it true. He's telling you what you want to hear to keep getting into your pants.
Z0GfGZtJaa	Did it take a year of emails before you figured this out?   I think you will be best served with honesty.|`|5HtaeJPtaa	First you need to ask yourself why you want to end this friendship. What are the reasons you have friends? What qualities are important to you in a friendship? What are the reasons you would want to end a friendship? After you have learned these parameters about yourself, it will be easier to end this friendship because you will have a concrete reason to discuss with her. She deserves a good reason and explanation after a year of developing a connection with you. Be honest, direct, and kind.|`|1iXvphNYaa	Tell her the truth. If it's respect you're concerned with.|`|wrFN18Xjaa	Tell her, I'm sorry but I'm not interested in being your friend anymore.  If she takes it hard, oh well.

xmWxafHSaa	If you don't tell him, how will he know.  Ask him something about class or what he did over the weekend.  Just make a random comment about hating Monday's or something.  See how he responds to you.  If he is open to talking to then that is a good sign for you to continue to talk to him.  Nothing ventured is nothing gained.     Good luck.|`|Hhs2h61Oaa	well if you want him to know that you like him make flirty comments   to him & see how he acts and responds if he flirts back he prob likes you if he doesnt . what eve (:|`|dnld9tqhaa	then that's too bad

VXQFT341aa	Well if she is really your best friend then you should tell her. WTF. Gee what a bad *** wanting to fight a girl.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Yes you should tell...Just say "hey i dnt know if you heard but that guy that was at your party is spreading all these rumors about you" then go on to tell her what u heard and then the rest is up to her!!!

He is a liar. the girl deserves to know this could put a bad rep. on her. seriously.|`|FIcc1OREaa	I'd tell her about it...what an ******!. If you guys fight...don't throw the first punch and don't seriously injure or kill him. That should take care of the legal stuff.    Just tell her straight up. Even if she did all that stuff with him, doesn't she deserve better than to have him sharing it with the world and saying he doesn't even like her?|`|pUvEmPrCaa	You don't know what really happened or not.  This could all be true and you could just end up embarrassing your friend.    You should try to find out more of the story and get your facts straight before you do something that could make someone, especially your best friend feel uncomfortable.
AA10395956	Just say: "I like you, as a friend, but I'm not looking for a relationship at the time." The key is try not being to harsh. If he asks when you would, say: "I don't exactly know when, but I'll know sooner or later."|`|wfE3mo7Naa	The resulting search story should make for a good news story so go for it|`|VTqzpqR1aa	if he is like you said don't go out with him.

KaAXJJo8aa	of course it is abuse oO... you should tell an adult at your school you can trust so you can get help o.o|`|J4W68owgaa	Yes, it is abuse. Talk to a school counseler, teacher, priest, doctor, or police officer. All of those people are mandated reporters, which means they have to report any abuse to the proper agencies and get you the help you need.    I am so sorry you are going through this.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Of course it is. Talk to a school counselor, or some other responsible adult. Where is your Mom? Eat before U come home. Don't let this continue. Is there a safe place U can go to"? A friend's house maybe?|`|VSw6eN4Baa	Yeah, it is abuse.    Physical, emotional, and verbal. Seek help from a teacher or guidance councilor immediately.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Oh....yeah, that's pretty bad. I'm sorry kiddo. Is there anyone else you can go stay with? Grandparents, aunts/uncles? Anyone?  Does your mom know he's treating you like that? If she does, why would she allow it? Have you tried talking to a counselor or teacher at school?    I've been where you're at...my mom's boyfriends used to knock me around, too. I hope things get better for you. Take care..|`|6mtgvusqaa	Yes!! You should get some help!! Talking to a trusted adult would help! Make sure you get a trusted adult fast though! Good luck!!|`|cKhsVy8uaa	YES!    does your mom know or tell some1|`|V4iZcrVmaa	not really|`|lTFDQHixaa	Yes.  Tell a trusted adult.|`|1frcThISaa	YES IT IS. i went through this all my life, GET HELP, TALK TO SOMEONE!!|`|7UEkikfiaa	wow...  i think that would be neglect and abuse...  Consult a social worker, or someone of that nature.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Yes indeed.|`|jCUiWihtaa	my dad yells at me and crap but dosnt take away my food|`|4wFbQH53aa	yes! awh :(|`|H3Va1OKqaa	Yes, that is abuse. talk to a teacher, or a trusted adult.|`|Du84mgPZaa	yes it is also you're dad is a a**hole|`|RQc8fbjbaa	Yes. Tell someone you trust.|`|Hkjy7kLhaa	tell someone. im not sure what they could do, but i would tell someone, a friend, another gardian, somethign!|`|Gj9IQaJuaa	move out! its that simple|`|KGrMMAOaaa	yes. get help. tell a teacher or other trusted adult.|`|mQZceBaNaa	How old are you? Under 18? Go to the cops. Over 18? Leave home.|`|7WgOAhjMaa	maybe in a way.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	Yes.  This is abuse.  You should be talking to your mom, a guidance counselor at school, a teacher, a local police officer, or the school psychologist.     They have ways that they can intervene and handle the situation and leave you out of it for the most part.|`|aSdUzlIiaa	if the only reason he took it is so u cant have then ya kinda not abuse but he can get in trouble for it talk to ur school counciler|`|43JgLpkKaa	yes , it is abuse. contact your local child welfare office immediately.|`|lDO4O2FXaa	yes! do you need help? you should tell a friend or an adult! for help! =[|`|hjt0H2MQaa	Neglect, yes.  Abuse, not sure.  You said you bought yourself dinner - can I assume you drive?  If you are 18 or older - either call the cops for domestic violence (pushing you) or move out.   If you are under 18, I will still inquire with the police, teacher, principal, guidence counselor, etc.    Sorry you father is such a jerk off.|`|Nj4Dbce0aa	if he shoves you its physical abuse. if he yells at you its verbal abuse. if he starves you, once again, physical abuse.  tell the police or school counseler (i know people always hate doing that, but its surprising how much they can help)    right away.|`|tSZ7A1NPaa	Aww how sad! I feel bad for you! If your mom doesn't know, then tell her...that is if she won't do the same thing to you. Maybe sometime you should be really really nice to your dad, even if he does keep on doing this...no matter what just be nice to him. Try this for a couple of days. If it continues then tell a counsiler or an adult you can totally count on. Maybe like one of your relatives or just a friend.|`|AA11817078	this is really inhuman. what your mother is doing? discuss somebody /your relative/ community head/teacher, lastly call cops|`|kMAcj2Zzaa	yeah kinda|`|gRw5Mifkaa	Yes you should. Call the cops, tell your family, ask your teachers.|`|e99558c7c874edb09af2121c3e8bf91faa	it might be the start of a bigger abuse llater.. talk to someone close about it|`|j7WNkQIaaa	yes it is abuse... gosh that would suck. I'd tell a teacher or a trusted adult. make sure he doesn't find out you told them though or he might hurt you some more|`|MWC2MXlUaa	If all of this is for no reason at all, then yes that is abuse. And you need to get help right away. I know you probably love your dad and dont want anything to happen to him but that is wrong if him.|`|uVEYInYJaa	absolutely is abuse.  where is your mom during this? or does she agree with your dad?  go tell a close friend, relative. or even a school teacher.    the shoving and refusing to let you eat are both physical abuse and the yelling (unless for a good reason) is verbal abuse. the verbal abuse is harder to prove.      good luck|`|Epgqu8tIaa	yes and you need to show him this|`|q6yJKulWaa	Yes this is abuse. You need to tell anther family member who you can trust. You can also call kids help phone line at 1-800-668-6868  or go to their web site   kidshelpphone.ca  they may be able to help as well.  I wish You good luck I know what it is like to be abused by a parent. It is one of the worst things a parent can do to a child.|`|H74qtpxHaa	your dads a douchebag.  you should tell someone before things get worse.  and trust me they can get much much worse.|`|TAoyflvzaa	omg!! are you okay? how old are you do not let him do this to you because he is more than likely drunk get yourself out of there immediantly before he hurts you or somebody else JUST LEAVE go to your moms house!! just get out of there if it gets to serious your uncle?aunt?gpa?gma? dont wait until it's to late, or you will be heavily regreting you didnt  say your going on a walk or some excuse get your cellphone and call for help thats what i did when this happend to me but send me an IM|`|7xZ5wti6aa	I would say it is.
kqa9VFrfaa	Grab the phone book and look up different government agencies. Look under housing and HUD. Can U live with a friend or other relative? Go to the nearest welfare office and ask for help. Is there a Children's Services near U?
5r6xSlbPaa	Be unexpected. Be unpredictable and be outgoing. Just do your best, and remember, when flirting the slightest physical contact creates a response in the other party.
AA11909552	He just might be intimidated by you. Perhaps you should just flirt with him more. Ask him to do something with you after school. Tell him you need his help figuring out something. It's the least he could do for *your* help. Then just take him to a coffee joint and have him decide what you want to drink, or something silly like that. He will get tickled and you guys can bond more. (you don't have to do that coffee thing. just get him away somewhere)  These days, sometimes it is best for the girl to take the reigns. He just might be scared of you in some fashion. You'll do just fine. I have faith in you!
cei3Xnn3aa	69|`|4drQ38qZaa	30 not I'm kidding. 15-18 is perfect! But better... when you can drive.|`|Xprsabo9aa	I say 16|`|792VLzvJaa	5...  first time you should have sex...8    hope this helped.|`|EvvWL0PSaa	14
RKId3WQxaa	she puts out|`|jJwuMTSqaa	She likes being around you and tends to flirt with you. You can also tell by the way she looks at you. You just know.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	cause she's got a *****|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	grab your balls, stand up like a man and say, "baby, i like you"    and you wait for a reply|`|f7l9byFGaa	You catch her looking at you a lot and she flirts with you.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	If she gives you a lot of attention, smiles at you. flirts with you and makes you feel you're the only one around. I think it's just an instinct that you'll just know.|`|zSdeMhvAaa	well.. what i do when i like a guy is flirt with him a little. when he is around i kind of twirl my hair and i stare at him a lot i gues :D smiles and i simply go up to him and talk to him|`|EuhWXJgiaa	most of the girls like cute hot and kinda sweet boys so be hot cute and sweet and they will defenetly like u !|`|5h75xdztaa	she flirts with you. she stares at you. she smiles at you.|`|YUX0vy6haa	lick her face.....youll know|`|YGVPn3Fkaa	haha vavavOOm youre a legend  shell go out of her way to talk to you or text you  shell smile, make eye contact, and make up every reason to talk to you again.  youll feel it =)|`|3X6Gs1utaa	depends on the girl. some girls are really shy and might look away from you or avoid eye contact, but look at you when you don't notice. some will stare at you. ( but not in a creepy way, more an admiring way) some will flirt, it all depends on the type of girl. and if she is like me she will be so shy that sometimes she will make really stupid mistake like i did. but just talk to her like a friend at first! and keep doing that! don't give up! i am in a similar situation with a boy i know right now|`|RDxhQonWaa	to know if hes likes you   if she texts you alot  flirts with you   talks to her friends about you not just if you hot but if you do something funny   if she stares major give away   when you habgou with her how does she react when a hot guys goes by   if she looks more than a min then she doesnt if she glaces and looks back at you then def has a crush on you ........................    it also depends on the type of girls im more of a quite type in the beginning and then i say something so yeah hopefully i helped you|`|zfm51Rpyaa	Well there are a couple things. If she calls or texts you without you doing the same first its hint that she wants to talk and she wants to get to know you. If she wants to hang out with you without much hesitation thats a good sign. If she is always smiling around you or if she just enjoys your attention then that is good too. some girls are different. some are hard to interpret. some are just talkaholics and you might think that shes interested but shes not. Usually there arent may chicks like that. Sometimes you get a girl who might like you but is just shy so you think she doesnt like you. A majority of the girls act like what i said at the start of the paragraph. Just kinda figure out what kind of girl she is and make your judgement from there. Usually u can find this out through her friends. But just be cool and kind and let them come to you. I hope this helps|`|iPwky0f2aa	Well, talk to her, and see if she likes you, or influence one of her friends to talk nice about you.|`|476CZiIPaa	She will smile at you a lot and want to be around you :)|`|Tm3UshSvaa	she will flirt with you and smile around you do stuff like that!|`|w2T2kZtCaa	she flirts with you obv?  you catch her staring at you  shes really touchy with you  she smiles alot when your around    yknow how it is, the usual ;)|`|kpJrsuNHaa	Does she ditch her friends to talk to u  does she look at u alot and smile|`|jXQYYBCeaa	if she is flirty or jokes around with you she probably likes you. if she is shy and you can tell she wonders what she says around you she probably likes you. it is kinda hard to tell, i have the same problem. how do you know if a guy likes you or how do you make a guy like you?
8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I divorced my husband for alcohol and drug abuse and his drug of choice was mj--he was 34 when I married him...      I am personally not one of those people who say "you knew this when you married him, so you're stuck with him."  Especially when it comes to illegal activity.  And really especially after you become a mother.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	I was a 70s pothead, and it ruined my future--my gpa was 1.79.   But I DID grow out of it in my 20s, as I believe any mature person will.  Potheads are total losers- it saps all ambition for good grades, good jobs, good parenting...all they care about is the next joint. Been there, done that.    Be happy he is gone, but be sure to get child support. You will someday meet a MATURE man, who isn't a slave to weed, and who puts you first instead of a drug. Good luck...you will need it.|`|AA11447210	Usage depends on the person. Some do it when they're young, then quit. Some don't try it until they are older, and may do it occasionally...some do it on and off most of their life (without using frequently), and I've known some adults (middle aged and younger) who smoked it like some people smoke ciggs.    Some people can do it on occasion and not have any problem. Most of my friends will smoke it on occasion, if available but go months or more without and not think about it.    Different people react differently, and some are more prone to addictions and dependencies than others. Sorry that your relationship ended, whether or not pot was the root of the issue...but it certainly could have been at least part of it (if not all).    I'm 44 and it's been a while since I've smoked it. I'm not against it but it tends to make me feel "green" so I don't always partake even when it's available. Moderation is the key, as with most things. ?|`|LMIbr1aeaa	I am 40. I just barely started. Only socially once in a blue moon like at house parties with close friends and new much younger family members.  Like in the movie Pineapple Express.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Well first, good for you for giving that junk up!     You're absolutely right - he's addicted to it. It seems that most people are sadly misinformed when it comes to pot; it is NOT harmless (as you've clearly seen; it broke your family up) and it IS addictive.     There is absolutely NO excuse for a grown man to refuse to stop smoking pot when he has a child to be responsible for. It doesn't matter what age he is, although a 30-something year old man refusing to stop smoking is just ridiculous.     As far as people telling you that you shouldn't have expected him to change, they're wrong. YOU changed, didn't you? And I personally know many people who have smoked it - even every day for years - and gave it up. He CAN give it up, IF he realizes that he's got a problem and makes up his mind to change his own life. But the sad fact is that it's just like all the other drugs out there....he probably thinks there's nothing wrong with doing it, thinks it's not addictve, is certain that he can stops anytime he wants to yet gets angry when you suggest it to him....pot is illegal for good reason. He needs to realize what he's doing and leave that crap alone. I hope he does.     good luck...|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	We all have choices to make in this life. Some are easier than others. Addicted or not, he made himself and marijuana his priority in life. He likes being a 30 something year old that is the same intellectually as a 20 year old. He doesn't want to grow up. He did you a favor if that is how he wants to be.   My husband's uncle is 40. He still lives with his parents. He is a huge pot head, he has also moved on to xannex (sp) pills, and probably some other things. The sad part is he has a 16 year old son that recently moved with him, and they do drugs together. His son hasn't gone to school regularly since the 8th grade.  Hopefully since you decided to make your son a priority and he decided to leave, your son will grow up knowing stability.  Your husband's behavior isn't normal to the general population, but it is apparently normal for him, and he intends to keep it that way..|`|81wvN8Rraa	By now it's an addiction and up until now you have been enabling him to continue. He won't stop until he is ready so leave or deal with it.|`|MyzkHJLraa	He is an addict you have to realize that you cant help someone change if they do not want to change. Sometimes bringing a child into the world will make some people grow up & take on responsibilities others could care less.
zhk8o514aa	So what you are saying that you will not have any guys friends or talk to any guys at all while you're on a relationship with him?    Cuz that is the same point that you are making with him.|`|evJ2GEodaa	You two should break up.  Trust issues are going to be a problem for the rest of your relationship.|`|zoMMNwXcaa	well if he really loves you he wouldnt call you his "Ex-girlfriend" you should dump him before he dumps you. make him feel guilty. punish him for his actions|`|H3Va1OKqaa	You don't deserve to be treated like that, it's a very unhealthy relationship. I'd suggest getting over him.|`|cxKR99KIaa	It's your call but personally if I was you I would move on it looks like he doesn't feel the same especially if he said that it was my ex girl friend? you deserve alot better|`|O1QDrdDoaa	well i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this guy is jus not trust worthy, if you caught him already do stuff like this, it'll only progress further, you may love him in all, but are you willin to put yourself through yrs possibly of stress and heartache, if you can get on his messaging again, tell this girl that you are his gf, and if she knew that you were in the picture to begin wit, if not, your dude is jus a Fool, I really hate guys who treat girls like ****, pisses me off.|`|aavNyOeyaa	hes a dick, leave him.       ps he's cheated on you before|`|cb4HEkGhaa	well i think you should trust him|`|8fOLKcjdaa	Cut him some slack.  He didn't actually do anything.    Jesus, I had a girlfriend back in high school who was like this.  She got extremely jealous when I talked to female friends.    Dumped that girl at the first sign of her crazy side.|`|8pOa11dIaa	okay, sweetie. no offense. but GET A GRIP!!! if he is being unfaithful to you (even if he IS just messing around) then he doesn't deserve you. talk to him about it more and let him KNOW that it is bothering you and that if he does it anymore then u will need to end the relationship bc you deserve better. good luck, dear.|`|vED9Pwiuaa	DUMP HIM!!!!!!
0bGDcN0Iaa	tell his parents and suggest to them that he see a shrink or psychiatrist.|`|7V79OMMHaa	Anyone who wants to kill himself is weak anyway. When you think about it, your situation could always be worse. That guy needs some help, he needs to calm down and realize that the world doesn't revolve around him, and that there are people that care about him too much for him to do something so selfish and stupid. But remember, you can't save those who don't want to be saved.      Stay Cool
AA12290249	i would accept the fact that yes you might have been 'dissed'. i would definitely talk to him and find out whats up though and whats going on and if you two are still having a thing or not. get answers and figure out what you want and stick to it. don't falter.    good luck    *edit* and noodles? I read this. obviously, it's not a book. you're an idiot. there is no too long of a question, each question should be read fully and understood instead of answering in such a dumb way like that example you just gave.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	write a freaking book and I won't read it...can you have made that ANY longer...who the f*** is going to read that s***|`|lAjnRFSVaa	yes|`|aCdya2qkaa	lolz. at the guy above, are you planning to be the next Stephen King.|`|VwG2lhcNaa	Yea well it would seem like he just used you.|`|XcB06N6maa	he probs feels uncomfortable knowing you'd be so low to sleep with someone who had a girlfriend and doesnt wana get involved with someone like you xx|`|8oPVcYSyaa	Okay u got played{ sorri} 4get him your better than that and if it's really bugging u ask him what's up    if he says he just wats 2 b with his girlfriend then you'll really know        if u feel betrayed then u could   steel his cell phone  call his girlfriend  tell her everything             revenge is sweet       im just kidding, unless your krazy?????????|`|0ky4TktEaa	It's good that you acknowledge that you've messed up. Make sure you don't ever do that again since it will never get you anywhere with a guy who you truly like. I'm willing to bet this guy just sees you as a piece of a$s. Not trying to be harsh but you were just there to help him get over his breakup with his girlfriend. Now that he's moved on from that some, he's ready to start actually looking for a new girlfriend. Unfortunately, he doesn't see you as girlfriend material; something like a rebound.    My advice is to leave this guy alone. Try to move on from this, even if that means finding a new job. DO NOT mess with any more co-workers. And definitely don't go give a guy comfort sex and think that will make him like you. That only makes him think thanks for making me feel better so I can get up and find a new girlfriend, see you later.     Yes you were used. I seriously doubt this guy will ever treat you like someone he's actually interested in. You missed that chance when you had comfort sex. So learn from your mistake and move on.
5bYpbodUaa	I found my hubby on Match.Com.  :-)  And it only took me a couple of months.  He was the first one I emailed, and the second one I dated.    Good guys are still out there!  :-)  We've been married for five and a half years now, and we have a four year old son, and another on the way!  :-)  He's truly a great guy. Everything I prayed for.  :-)    You will find yours.  :-)|`|df20f780e29b5cda4abf6f0d9f61d5baaa	Start here:    www.theyearofyes.com/    Be open to all possibilities.  Get rid of any prejudices you have.  You may think "I don't want a guy who is _____" - get rid of that idea.    Bald - okay, ugly - okay, handicapped - okay, too young - okay, criminal record - okay, into NASCAR - okay, too old - okay, doesn't speak English - okay.     Give them a chance and it may be better than you think.     Second, be attractive.  Don't go to the grocery store in sweats.  Spend some time in the gym and keep your body in shape and your hair nice and just look like someone who cares about herself.  It doesn't matter if God didn't give you perfect looks, it matters what you do with it that counts.  Take good care of yourself and it will affect your whole attitude and how you project yourself to other people.  Look in the mirror and be proud of what you see, and other people will like what they see, too.    Third.  We all have a range of behavior that we are comfortable in, and I'm not asking you to be something you are not, but be at the edge of your comfort range on the side of friendly, outgoing, cheerful.      Fourth. Guys just hate asking a woman out and being turned down. You don't have to flirt, but a little eye contact and a smile can send the signal that you would not turn someone down, and make it easier for a guy to ask.     Fifth.  Go to places where you might meet someone you would like.  Bars are probably not the right choice unless you like guys who hang out in bars.  Lots of churches have singles clubs, book stores have readings,  support your favorite political campaign as a volunteer, go on hikes with Sierra Club, whatever feels right for you.|`|gMYVvjzgaa	try the nursing home.|`|Q8R9E7lDaa	It's very hard to find a respectable man in this day and age, or that really has a lot qualities.

PseVmBS8aa	I think he has a Crush on you for sure and yes you should say it back. I mean he is saying it so why shouldn't you as long as you don't already have a boyfriend. This may just be the beginning of a beautiful relationship. Besides it's fun.  It's a game.|`|8oPVcYSyaa	HE'S JUST JOKING, IF U THINK HE'S BEING SERIOUS THEN TELL HIM, " R U BEING SERIOUS, STOP PLAYING WITH MY EMOTIONS" THAT WILL HELP

DLS60sVBaa	It depends on what you think the definition of 'true' is. I suppose you could meet with people that have similar interests and become their friend because of that. Someone who shares your aspirations.
iD4ejChZaa	oh yes mam would i ever tell her.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	What are you going to do, follow him around the rest of his life warning women? I think you should post it on the website that exists for things like this (I think a great idea tho I can't remember the site name) and then let it go. If she sees it (or future women) she does, if not, you've done what you could to warn the world..    After that, drop it and go live a happy life :)|`|fHfVRcqbaa	No.  One day, she may come to you and ask you about him.  Then you can tell the truth.  To go to her would seem like you are bitter ofer the breakup.  If she is smart, she'll figure him out before long.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	No. He is not your problem any more  - be happy|`|e1oky4jSaa	It's best to just stay out of it ( unless you are fighting for your marriage back, then that is a different story). If you are truely done with this marriage and you left him for good, just stop letting him affect you. Nothing good can come from telling her about his infidelity, she will learn soon enough. And who knows what lies he has told her about you. I would just move on.|`|hcgaizJCaa	Absolutely not. First of all, she probably wouldn't believe you and you would be seen as the meddling ex. Second, you may not have cheated, but you weren't perfect and i doubt you would want hubby telling your new mates about your issues. If she asks, don't lie, but i definitely would not seek her out to tell her. Every woman is entitled to make her own mistakes.|`|AARZV2v0aa	he will get what he deserves. CARMA!! but i wouldnt go looking for trouble. Get a divorce and move on with your life... you deserve it!|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	This is an easy one. File for divorce, move on, and then you don't have to worry about his love life anymore...|`|HeJjK8slaa	No, she'll find out on her own. I would just stay out of their business, and get on with your life.|`|SK7MxFTnaa	NO.  Let her find out what a jewel she picked the hard way.    She didn't have a problem when he was cheating on you.  Why should you care if he does it to her?|`|79eBn6V8aa	it's up to him to tell her...if you tell her she'll just resent you and think you want him back or something|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	She'll find out, and then she'll know everything he said was a lie. Just let it alone.|`|o1yy6KABaa	No - because by doing that shows that he is still hurting you and thats what he wants. Dont give him the satisfaction, what he does now is no longer your business.|`|eO82RK1Maa	she will find out soon enough, believe me. my ex husband did the same thing before our divorce and it fell around him.  she probably would make her own excuses for him anyway.|`|B1sT1t44aa	People live and learn in this this life and I am sure when he does it to her she will understand his lesson well. Right now she is probably way to in to him to heed your warning and  may not care that he is still married so let her deal with it's outcome.|`|I3Jywei7aa	did they meet at work?|`|NeTNnvSZaa	You're just going to make him angry.  Be careful.|`|J4W68owgaa	I would stay out of it. If you do get involved in it, you'll seem like a bitter ex just trying to cause trouble.    I know you are probably just looking to protect this new woman from the hurt you endured, but if you get in the middle of their relationship, you'll be the one that comes across bad, not him.    But, because I know how us women are, *if* you do feel the need to tell her things, ONLY tell her you are still his wife. Call his place and if she picks up, tell her it's his wife calling. Then don't say anything more, that should do plenty to open her eyes.    Good luck|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Why should you care what he does now that you aren't together.   Let her figure it out for herself - he will probably just mess it up with her too let hium get himself out of that mess it is none of your business.   he is out of your life - so you should stay out of his love life|`|K8OjmMUAaa	She'll find out without you interfering...believe me, she will! Sadly, it's probably going to be the hard way, but I don't think that it should come from you.     First....you're "the ex". How likely do you really think she will be to believe something you say about her new man? She's blinded by love right now. She'll just call you a liar, tell your ex, and start drama. Then she'll be even more resistant to anyone telling her the truth about her new boyfriend in the future.     I think that you should let it come from another source. You caught him...she will too, and so will the next one and the next one. The new girlfriend will stop being dumb soon enough.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	What are your motivations? Just to be mean? Or to do a great service to the sweet lady?

Your meddling won't be appreciated and people need to make their own mistakes or they will never learn anything.
Kh5o3QCcaa	Wow, this is so familiar, though the roles reversed, with the exception that my situation didn't or doesn't escalate like that.      I can hear how much you love him, and how uncomfortable your comfortable life with him has become- and it is driving you nuts (me and my husband go through the house habits all the time.  =0])    I also heard you say that you were ready to leave, and you sounded excited about doing what you needed to do to start fresh.    I think that if you can find it so easy to walk away, perhaps you need some time out of this relationship.  Not to say you don't love him, but when I was dating I needed to be free after feeling trapped for awhile.  Maybe you need to try out some less serious relationships, or just be alone.  Find out exactly what you want in a man, and what you don't.   The way I have always looked at these situations is:  What is meant to be will be.  If your paths cross later on, or the timing seems right later on, then you will already know him, as far as who he is as a person, and now you will have had time to know deep inside yourself whether or not this is truly what you want.    Doing this also saved my relationships with the men and the families, because if you allow this to continue (which it will eventually when he gets comfortable again) you could end up hurt and holding a grudge against him for these small (but often annoying things) and hurting him because of it.  Hence hurting your relationship with his Mom as well.    Sounds to me like his Momma just gave him a good scolding- so he'll be on his best behavior for awhile.    Sorry this is long, but I hope  it helps.  Best of luck to you!|`|OdTLUprzaa	Yeah I definitely think that you both have things to work out on your own for a bit.  In one way, everyone has problems with their partners, but not speaking for that long just isn't good.  A break would be ideal.  And if you call it that, a "break", it means that you are just going to try it, you don't have to leave him forever.  A break from each other can mean that you'll cool off and miss each other, which would strengthen your relationship.  Or it could mean that you realize that you don't deserve to be treated like that and you don't need a hot tempered man in your life.  Good luck with whatever you decide :-)|`|AA12354369	take the counselling.  That might help.
HFqiY6BGaa	have him over for dinner one night with the family|`|7V79OMMHaa	Honestly, you sound like you know what you really want, but you're parents have a pretty good point. You have to talk this over with then and hope you can convince them that you will be fine (it is very rare for other people to actually "bully" people who date interracialy). If they still don't approve then you have to let it (dating outside your race) go until you turn 18.    EDIT: No, you technically don't need permission to date him, BUT to persue a reltionship with a guy your famly doesn't approve of at such a young age just simply won't work.      Stay Cool|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Its more normal these days to see interracial couples than same race couples in my opinion! Just let them know he is a good guy and that race shouldnt matter as long as your happy. Im white and my hubby is black, Nothing wrong with that =]|`|xArlqHtraa	Maybe you should let your parents meet the guy that you like, to show them that he's a good guy and show them how much you really like him. You can also try telling her that nowadays there are so many interracial relationships and nobody really cares what color everyone else is anymore. Especially because you're younger, you're also more openminded. I hope this helps!|`|771454b5e041b041d8c1257a9a391ad9aa	Bring him over for dinner or introduce your parents to him just to show them that he really is a good guy and he's really genuine. Also it will show them that he's not the typical bad black guy and this will get all their superficial and stereotypical ideas out of their heads. Remeber to stay relaxed and be yourself.|`|HfZeQR4Aaa	You're right. He is a person. We are all people. Why would anyone think otherwise. I can understand your parents fear. They don't want you to have to deal with racist people. Your parents seem like they don't want any trouble and are very easy going people. Some people just believe that their kids should date within their own race or culture. I have no problem with that.     You should respect your parents wishes and not date him. While you're under their roof you should abide by their rules. When you move out and become an adult you can date who you want. Interracial dating is hard and can be tested by racist people.     You're 15 and shouldn't be concerned with race issues at your age. Just have friends from other races to get a better idea of their heritage. You don't have to date people from other races to like them.    Quick question: Would your parents mind if you dated an asian or hispanic guy? Just curious.|`|CVA86LY6aa	Tell them the times have changed and get out of the 1950's and 60's!!!   Tell them you like who you like and they need to be supportive no matter what race, religion or gender for that matter!!!
0ky4TktEaa	Doesn't sound hard to me. Sometimes you need to step back from the relationship and realize that when you're fighting more than you are laughing with someone, it's not going to work out. You just said you two fight all the time because you feel he isn't mature enough. So let him go unless you plan to sit there and wait for him to mature enough. It's also unfair to him that you are in love with another guy while you are with him.    So dump this guy and take some time to really think if you want your ex back. Although it sounds like you already are sure that you do.
C0K3Bo2Aaa	Hi. My sister in law checks into a motel for a couple days when things get out of hand or she needs some "me" time.  Hope you work it out!

Do they tell you this? Seriously..good idea to get away for a bit.|`|L0jeEhChaa	depends on where you live. go for a walk in the woods or take a hike in the mountains, a walk on the beach, anywhere you feel comfortable and can get some peace and solitude.|`|FOjYdZMeaa	Lake Tahoe, Acapulco, Tahiti, etc.|`|AA12290249	depends on where you live. if you're talking about a vacation, you can go anywhere by yourself because, well, you'll be by yourself ha ha. but depending on where you live, you can go wherever to think to yourself. there's plenty of places you can go to think without having the pressure of singles get aways.    my mother is almost 41 and is single and she's just fine. don't be so bummed out, some people just don't meet people in this life. but 30 isnt too old, you could still meet someone :) my mom's friend got married at 43. so don't give up, but don't set yourself up for disappointment.     good luck|`|aab30902c32aa18d4eeead9019224c2aaa	Are you sure being alone to think is what you want?  Wouldn't it be better to ask  couple girlfriends along to help you figure it out?    If meeting guys is a problem, I think Taylor offered you some good advice.    Otherwise ... find yourself a good Embassy Suites somewhere and hole up.|`|aavNyOeyaa	a bar, but first take a fist-full of valium|`|sWFIJtGmaa	Go to some clubs, bars, and parties to meet new boys. But be careful. Alot of them might be drunk and that will cause them to be irresponsible. Or some of them are so interested in having a good time that they only want a one night stand. Don't let someone use you to their benefit.   Another good place to meet nice guys are any social gatherings you can find. If you go to college, join a study group or a club. There are plenty of hotties at the gym. I've met alot of my boyfriends there.  The library is also a good place because this way you know that atleast they are smart and determined. Some of them are good looking.  Dont give up just yet!!  They're are soo many cuties out there.|`|RDxhQonWaa	well i like to be alone to think but when your 10 and guys dnt want to date you your wronge trust me it is easy to find a guy just got to be more confident in yourself mabe if you get a new hair style that will help or go shopping for new clothes that too does bring your confidence up i use to have a low self esteem but im think im Beautiful how you look at yourself is how others around you think of you too so mabe your  aren't happy idk you but really all you proly need is a makeover or a spa treatment an then go out to plac you like to go and looks for guys there
naequcqlaa	How long have you been going w/your b/f?  How well did you know him before you started to date him?  A guy is going to try to go as far as a girl w/let him, it's up to you to tell him to ease up & you want to just take it a little slower.  If by any chance he tries to force you into anything against your will, that's the time to break it & that no means no.  If you are worried, just tell him you'd like to take things a bit slower & you don't want to rush into anything just yet.  If he's a decent guy, he'll do as you requested.  If not, then by all means get rid of him & don't let him take advantage of you...Best to you...:)|`|HeQG85R1aa	Well i was in the same situation before where my bf was all over me but without asking. If he really cares about you he would ask you permission. But most guysare like that and if you guys are really serious maybe he feels its ok to move on you know. Anyways my advice would be that if your not comfortable with him doing that tell him to ask first or stop. You need to stand up for youself ok..  hoped it helps

nolxYfzUaa	Your Dad does have a problem.  He has to realize it though.  And, I am sorry that you are going through this.  Talk to a counselor at school, or go to the police station and ask what your options are.  Pray alot.  Maybe your Dad is mad at himself and taking it out on you guys.  Either way, you are in my prayers.|`|G024yAU3aa	That's a tough one kiddo.  There are mean drunks-I know because my mother is a mean drunk. I would go to your guidance counselor and let them know what is going on.  They can help you and maybe even get you removed from the home. It's a volatile situation and there are people out there that can help you.     In the meantime I would get some counseling to and maybe check out ALANON meetings.  They are meetings to support loved ones with alcoholic family members.  There are people of all ages including teenagers in these meetings-they are very helpful.     Good Luck!
CzdxFiRLaa	Yes, and she was quite embarrassed at first.  I held her, smiled and kissed while she continued and then with the shower still running we made love.  It was erotic, exciting, and a complete turn on for both of us.    It has happened a few times, but not anything we actually plan to do.  She was intrigued the first time I had to pee in the shower too, as she had never seen a guy pee previously.|`|3Bfv6aUyaa	no but I pooped on someone when they were in the bath. they kicked me out OMG

I like a girl with natural straight hair. They have to be shorter then me. I'm 5'10 and love girls that are like 5'1 - 5'4. The body doesnt matter that much to me but i dont like chubby girls.|`|sI4MK0KAaa	girls of any shape can be appealing, they dont have to have a big or small butt or be tall or shorter than me.     the first thing is usually the body of the girl, as thats what im lookin at. tho its the personality that keeps me attracted. no good the girl havin a great body if she has a messed up mind|`|AA11284982	hmmm... im kinda into girls that are bit curvy. but first things first i look for a girl with nice smile and teeth.|`|tr5lG02Xaa	BOOOBIES!|`|igBds5Lhaa	For me the butt does not have to be big or small but well rounded.   The hips should be a decent size not to big but not to small. sometimes there is such a thing as too much or too little depending on your body type.  Hair doesn't matter.  I like them to be a little shorter than me or the same height but never taller.  I personally like the all natural look.    The very 1st thing i look at when i SEE a woman is obviously her body because that's in front of you but that is not the 1st thing i look FOR in a woman. I look for a great smile, nice eyes, natural beautiful face with good shape and her laugh (cant laugh like a horse) then comes the personality, body, background and everything else.|`|sXT86Swqaa	As far as physical features?    I like legs and butts are a close second. Medium hips, curly brown or black hair and tall but not taller then me.     First thing I look at when I meet a girl? Her smile.
oUuDyzVmaa	um its different but not. u dont want to seem clingy so i wouldnt be saying regularly things like "hey!" because not only is it a waste of money, it will become annoying. but like the person sed above, just see how they react to your texting. but overall i wouldnt go overboard... maybe even just twice a week if u speak to them face 2 face during the day.|`|thTmuy1Aaa	judge by her answers. if she responds with really short mesages or it takes a long time for her to get back to you then i would suggest texting her less often|`|WtzXH4Jeaa	Try around three times a week.  It saves on your monthly bill and you are not "there" too much in her life, but are "there" enough for her to know you are in her life and care.|`|sveBTYSpaa	texting is definitely less annoying, but can still be overdone. if you text your friend, make it a rule for yourself that you can't text them again until they text you back.     good luck :)
adCVnOVwaa	maybe because he wants to beat somebody up if they look at u.|`|jf1oPsSeaa	because like you said he likes your legs and he probably wants to show you off anyway. also, if he's your sort of boyfriend, then of course he's going to be mad when another guy is going to take you to homecoming!|`|mL07N3IAaa	not all guys are that jealous! so maybe your "sort of boyfriend' is like that. i know mine is..|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	unless you let him... he owns you now.    i recommend immediate purging of this worthless relationship
YxZ4EdqOaa	Men are simple-minded. He likes you in skirts because of what he said (he likes your legs). The other guys you talked about are insecure about themselves.

Yes, you may love him, but is it fair to yourself that you are with someone who treats your poorly?    You deserve someone who will be nice and loving to you, and if he is doing things like avoiding your touch then maybe it is time to call it quits.      You can be happy with someone else.  If he doesn't want to talk, tell him his options: You either talk about it and work it out, or you sack him.  I bet you could find someone better, and once you get over this guy, can come to love someone else 10 times more.|`|AA10726533	I don't think you love him. I have been in your shoes and I thought I loved him as well, but when I asked myself what I loved, I couldn't answer.   If you can't touch him or talk about things then that will evolve into bigger problems. You are the only one that will make the final decision because none of us know you. All we do is give you the extra motivation.  For me, breaking up with my ex made me feel so amazing. Yes i miss him, yes i want to see him, but I have moved on. We had nothing in common, he was an idiot, and he never opened up to me and couldn't hold an intelligent conversation.  Just think about things.

7igxiGrAaa	The situation is not fair to you and you need to find someone who will appreciate you and your daughter for who you are and will respect your needs as well.

He has no rite to go out all the time w/HIS friends but not think enuf of you to take you out & treat you decent.  You should not have to take care of him when he's drunk either.  He got that way, let him take care of himself.  Don't let him take advantage of you, that's what he's doing.  You on the other hand are falling for it.  Stop doing everything for him, he should be doing things for you too.  It sounds like he might just have a drinking problem, or the starts of one.  This you do not need.  Just take care of yourself & your little girl & don't let him take advantage of you.  He's NO better than you are.  See if his friends have families & you all could get together & have some fun.  Ask him about that, see what he says.  Good luck to you...:)|`|eIzv9Lwwaa	sounds like u already kno wats up. u should nvr have had his kid for one. it only complicates things. u should nvr move away from family and friends for a guy because they arent reliable. family can help wen u need them wen things go wrong. move back where u came from. if he wants to see his daughter them it should be in ur presence. u should kno this stuff im sorry to say. think of ur child first. is he fit to be a father> no, not wen he is a lying drunk. it could get out of hand and he could become abusive. then wen u think of yourself, who takes care of everything? u do. leave while u can. its only love for u for sum odd reason. if he loved u he would invite u places, introduce you to ppl and try making u feel comfy and at home. he is irresponsible. love hurts, but u have to teach sometimes. make sure u have sole custody of ur child. he might try using it against u. i may be a 16 yr old but i kno a bad relationship wen i c it. my mom is still in one and there is no love btw them. just a man screwing her over and im glad im no longer living there to endure his bi polar idiocracy.|`|jhegodFYaa	eat lots of marshmallows|`|cX3yqEtVaa	he is an ***.. leave him|`|dNWWCWHDaa	sounds like you need to either get him to really listen to you, or dump him|`|7FGcU6ztaa	leave that ******|`|gkMszYM3aa	I think that you should sit and talk to him and tell him how you feel.  If that doesnt work leave him and tell your friends and family you made a big mistake.|`|34cuBZozaa	i'm gonna try to help you out.  I think you should tell him about it and tell him all tht u hav gave up for him and what you are sacraficing to be with him. Tell him you love him but he needs to step up. If he gets mad tell him u never wanna lose him but it feels like your doing all the work.                   Hope i helped|`|IgnCm6Wjaa	That is VERY sad that he is drunk. I feel very sorry for you and your daughter. I am very proud of you for sticking up for yourself. Definitely not wrongdoing. Confiscate or hide all beers/wines/alcohol so he does not get drunk at home. Make sure to ask where he is going when he leaves. If it sounds bad call a babysitter and go along. Try in any way to not let him get drunk. Once that is done try hiring some babysitters and go out for dinner or dance for once. Have friends come over that have kids so everyone enjoys themselves. Hope I helped!!|`|IikTFnCxaa	First, call your family and friends and make arrangements for a place to go if you need it...Second, tell him that either he steps up to the daddy/boyfriend plate and start doing his part, or you are taking your daughter and moving back home and he can pay child support.  Tell him that you didn't move in with him to have him be a selfish donkey.  Even though you love him, it sounds like he needs a wake up call. Either way, pick what you can tolerate and what is best for you and your daughter.|`|1VGx2BLvaa	AAWW....AS MUCH AS it HURtS yOU GOttA MOOf  it ON HONEy....iT AiNT RiGH
eFXD3Qzcaa	Like shake his hand and slip him the tickets.  See how shocked he is!!!
aGXankr2aa	Sit down with your father, ask him why he  isn't letting you go.  Explain your reasons  for why you want to go.  Stay calm, and even if doesn't see it your way, accept his decision - the next time something similar comes up he's liable to be more receptive.  Most father's are over protective of their daughters, if you can shown some maturity and nurture some trust - be open and honest with your father, and never betray any trust he shows you, you're liable to have a  better relationship.  No matter how embarrassing any situation seems, always remember that in all likeliness your parents have gone through a similar situation and talking to them, showing maturity will garner trust and respect.|`|EY0wnkh3aa	Well there must be a reason for this. I mean that doesn't make any sense... the seasons almost over? Well it's not over yet so ask him why you can't go and tell him that you 2 could do more things together if this is about him missing you or whatever. Try to say things that will make him let you go. Like clean your room more, help around the house, get better grades, etc.|`|IDVFsy5waa	I would just help out and try to act good at home and sit him down to ask him why you can't go and try to figure out a way to make it so that you can go and a way or something that both of you can agree on.
yMAfJngcaa	Just talk cause you dont want to rush things with him. Just hang out and enjoy each others company and have fun together first before making a move you might regret later.|`|4OlslkMmaa	Totally just talk. Don't worry about the first move yet.  I'm sure he'll make his first move soon enough!|`|AA10671142	don't move to fast, get to know each other first. he may just want to be friends with you|`|Dr6nCsZ3aa	Need details!  How old are you?|`|7rWfxVSpaa	Talk to him and get to know him. Just because you're hanging out, doesn't mean you guys are a couple xD|`|IuyO9Vq2aa	Don't make a move too soon.  Do it the next time you guys hang out  But if you know what you both are thinking, i think you'll know when|`|PF8zDzoWaa	i would talk and get to know him more first.|`|NC9FV8bLaa	Just talk for now.|`|AA11330914	just talk.|`|M0EehbBEaa	talk|`|oZuiq138aa	nooo i think its too early...just talk and maybe flirt a little  duh|`|VRuUQiA2aa	well i think yuh should; buh qive him time maybe he'll do it O1st.|`|NJwIXIrHaa	Just talk. Me and my bf have been going out almost a month and we haven't kissed yet. :)|`|vPkQpNQHaa	tu hablas a el
K6lK9Pukaa	Just remeber he asked u out  or he said yes to u when he could have said no  that means he likes u  so ur job now is not to screw it up|`|2mxbb6ULaa	A lil more info may have helped|`|YRrbPj6Saa	How old are you....? I have never heard of a girl being shy around a boy unless she is really young. Same with guys. If you can't drive yet you shouldn't have a boyfriend imo.|`|x8rYunYeaa	your shyness depends all on how comfortable you are around him  it sounds like you guys havent been together very long  which if thats the case, just be around him a little more. as he  gets more comfortable with u  open up little by little  and soon it'll be a breeze  trust me|`|RDxhQonWaa	go out more like with your friends and it will help alot bring him around your family go to your comfort zone and bring him too it will help break the shyness fast i know so cuz im shy and i usually bring my friend with till i feel completely comfortable with him|`|AaXVjsdfaa	drink some wine or vodka thats what i do :)|`|KATCMfLSaa	just relax... a boyfreind is someone you should be able to just be you around let you gaurd down and tryy to get out of your shell more around him|`|Yr1JsxSmaa	Let him know you get shy around him, and he will probably try to help you with that. Then the shy feeling with him will go away|`|7ZTlktMeaa	This will take time.... But being comfortable w/yourself is the first step! :) Once you learn to do that, you can be comfortable w/anyone!!|`|oUEjtZyEaa	you might have anexity if you are like that with everyone, so take xanax, or a couple of shots but dont get to drunk you don't wan to do something you regret which a lot of girls do while drunk.|`|V9oAV58Faa	It's normal to be shy around your boyfriend.  Sometimes, you don't realize he's there for you & other times, it may seem like he's not.    But trust me, he'll always be there and part of the reason he's with you is because he loves you for who you are.  Just think of him as your best friend, someone you go to when you are having a bad day.  Someone you can cry to, can tell all your secrets to & to be always tell you exciting stories too.  He loves you for you & that's what makes you guys so attracted.  :)      P.S. Make sure you don't tell him ALL your secrets because you can never trust one person fully.
sgRDJUXqaa	You don't want to be like his exes!  If you were, he'd just dump you too.    My boyfriend and I both have ex-fiances, people we had intentions to marry.  Those relationships didn't work out.  Now we're a couple and are getting very serious about marriage and having children together.  Will he ever love me in the SAME way he loved his ex?  No.  Will I love him in the SAME way I loved mine?  No.  But the love we have is wonderful, and those things we went through were what brought us closer together.    Don't worry about the women of the past because they're in the past.  You're the woman of the future.  Don't stress; he wants YOU.
3fcc8a67fc109dc6d5e33948cbbf4447aa	I know so is mine coming up guys are harder to get for. I usually get sentimental things like for his birthday I had a drawing done with us. You could do that, get a sketch done, get a gift card for a motorcyle place wear they sell gear.|`|pF63IMyVaa	if he likes dogs get him a puppy|`|RKId3WQxaa	give him a different position everyday for a month|`|XIlJr3Hpaa	I took my girlfriend for a plane ride in a little sesna over downtown Dallas at night for our 3 year. The lights and skylight were beautiful, and so amazing being right on top of it...just my two cents.    You can't use it forever, but the memories and pics are amazing!|`|Gd1hzWlAaa	This is a great website if he likes cars (in my opinion!)    http://www.caagis.com
HCMrR1O9aa	ok, to save your self, apologize for 'hogging' her, tell her you really have enjoyed her company and didn't mean to consume all her time, that you just really enjoyed hanging with her...and that you know she has other friends and that next time she gets a chance and has some free time, you would like to make it up by hanging out with her and everyone else SHE wants to, and dedicate the day to HER...lol that would be the best way to do it...i hope i helped you and i hope you get her back...good luck!!!|`|comuT2fkaa	you should give her some space and  back off.|`|bPd7llYuaa	just talk to her about it, just apologize to her for being to overbearing and tell her you will try to give her more space. if you don't communicate with her and tell her that you are sorry, then she'll never know how you feel and she will probably break up with you.|`|Qdqgc75uaa	lay back, understand that she has other things in her life that were there b4 u. and space is a good thing alot of times in a relationship, you dont want to burn out the flame b4 it every even really gets started|`|RDxhQonWaa	kk i understand you situation ive been there and and well you give her space text her and let her get with her friends jsut give her space and things will work out bt be nice about it don't say anything when she complains just listen and like you dnt absolute need to see her everyday or anything atleast 3 to 4 days a week but no more thats too much unless you live with her thats a different story just back off for awhile
B94G0Y7haa	well talk to your friend and tell him exactly what you just told us, that you dont want to lose him as a mate but you don't want to lose her either.
PSk0zY5uaa	1. Well when someone lies they tend make eye contact without bilking but get distracted easily  2. Look to the right (assessing right part of the brain)  3. Touch their face a lot  4. They take a while to answer then once they know what to say they start talking fast.  5. Repeat your question in their answer    EX: Did you go to his house?    No i did not go to his house.  6. Ramble on about little details    7. When they are talking to you their head is straight and not tilted to the side.
rGnszJ1Raa	If you don't like him all the time, then it may save you from psychological hardship later on to just find a different guy. I'm a guy, and it is true that we just don't feel like flirting sometimes. But, if your liking of him fluctuates with his "flirt pattern", then you may have something going on. And then, many guys (like three-quarters of my friends) just don't like asking girls out, usually for fear of commitment. At such a time you can either move on or try to get closer to him, because attention from girls is always highly desired from guys. But always just go with your gut feeling at the moment - if something is telling you not to do something, then just don't. Hope that helps =)
HiSVA9p8aa	This is SO considerate of you!    Why not just ask her if there is something she would like to do?  Tell her what you told us and that you are open to all kinds of ideas.  If the two of you put your heads together, she'll fully understand that you intend to honor her not impose.  And she might come up with something that none of us would ever consider.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Are you having a rehearsal?  If so, the rehearsal dinner is typically the responsibility of the groom and his family.  That's where your MIL would traditionally do "her thing" and shine.  Even if your fiancee & you are paying for the dinner, it would be nice to let your MIL be in charge of planning it.    Unity candles are another way to make sure both sides of the family feel included.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	you could ask her to read a poem or if she has a good singing voice you could ask her to sing a special song during the ceremony or if your having a unity candle you can ask her to sing during that part.|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	Have her light the candles and make the scenery is perfect. And then maybe let her help with getting you ready a little so she'll feel included.  Hope this helped!|`|Uy8ntukjaa	How about having your husband name her "best man"? There's no rule saying it has to be a guy and she'd probably be tickled pink to stand beside her son on his special day. Have her wear a dress that is different from the bridesmaids and matches the color schemes of the groomsmen. Alternatively she could read a special poem or piece of writing as part of the ceremony.|`|8C1a8uhpaa	Don't ask her to do any serving/seating jobs, it might make her feel used. You could try to pick something she is good at (as said above^^) and have her perform at the ceremony and make her feel special. I wish I could come up with a better idea, if I think of one later, I'll let you know.|`|mjyRcxUHaa	You could have her walk him to the front of the church from the side, kiss him and take her seat. Then also the reading of a poem and or a passage from the bible, would be nice.  If you do that, make sure you pick 3 or 4 readings that you like, and then let her make the final decision.     The reason why I say make it her decision is because, my grandmother read a passage at her sons wedding and there was a part that made her laugh, so she was a nervous wreck. I think she would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't for that. Good Luck!
ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	How long does the kiss last?|`|QSodlfMraa	if he tells you that your a good kisser
Cb5N6UaQaa	Do whatever you like. just try to not get caught in the act beacause they will not be discreet about anything. You will enjoy it and try that him enjoys it too. have a good time. Silly kids!!!|`|hRXGHnnNaa	its seven minutes in heaven... me may try to get past one little kiss|`|eUiMXcFcaa	don't say anything, just go for it|`|sXT86Swqaa	Call me ignorant but I never heard of the game "Seven Minutes in Heaven".|`|YPVLgV3baa	ummm,,,,lol        well it depends...lol...sometimes if a guy gets picked to kiss you in that game wont really do it if they dont like you ya kno?  but just,well,simply kiss him.lol|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Well for that game, you generally already know your gonna be making out with eachother, so  dont say anything, just do it|`|gMYVvjzgaa	"kiss me"  and pucker up.|`|tzmCxzuKaa	grow up thats for lil children|`|5MxYOnzdaa	"you, me ... our lips, together, NOW!" lol.... jk idk.. ive never even played that game and Im a senior in high school, no one plays that.|`|g59U5kwUaa	i dunno sorry but i seen that game in 13 going on 30 i love that movie (:|`|dLeRiM76aa	just grab him and get fiesty|`|2b17c80ce64ad216b8306152f28b338aaa	lols no one plays that anymore|`|JYg0zp2Haa	just kisss him like no tommorow    http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1408848 6dzz5z5...|`|IgnCm6Wjaa	Call me anything but what the heck is that game. whatever it is it sounds stupid and babyish and for elementry school kids.|`|tr5lG02Xaa	just grab him and get fiesty|`|6mUXN2l7aa	Starting leaning closer to him and just start making out!

Give him cute smiles and flirty eyes. Make sure he's enjoying the light flirting and if he does, lean in and go for it. Or if you don't want to go right into it, chat a bit, but be friendly AND flirty. Suggest something cute. Don't put any pressure on him though.  Best of luck =]|`|qQvsmZqQaa	grab his dick, you prude *****|`|R7226ve7aa	how old r u? just relax its a game if u dont wanna kiss dont, however if u think he is hot just wait for him to move and play along
Cb5N6UaQaa	Means that you will use this time to make all the mistakes you like and have an excuse. Or if you are just chill like it is just do nothing and relax and think about stuff but then problably the other person has use the time to male mistakes. And yes , remember mistakes are bad. that's why i call them mistakes. Be good!!!|`|dzROtYVxaa	well i have been in a similar problem and first of all i have always said to myself in previous relationships that if you really love some one you shouldnt need a break.. because if you need a break that means your second guessing your feeling for that person. and iam sorry to say this but there might be someone else that she interested in ...i know its hard to exept that.. this might be the truth ..espeically if you love that person it makes it even harder! but you should call after the week..and ask for answers let her know its ok to let you know how she really feels even if its going to hurt to here them ...over all try not to let it stress you out ! things will work out for the better!    |`|qQvsmZqQaa	you're probably fat, you dumb ****

8RNPlSAfaa	Yes women so often admire wrinkles. I just recall yesterday when that civil war vet was asking me to make out with him in his 1985 dodge and all I could think was "omg how hot are those wrinkles"    I think your husband is off the rocker!!|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think he must have thought it was funny too.  Nah, he's not trying to make you jealous.|`|W07vMTQvaa	He's flattered by the coworker and he's fishing for a compliment from you.  Just reassure him that you're not surprised because his grey hairs and wrinkles are very appealing!|`|uxrFOOn9aa	Wow he really must need you to stroke his ego lol. Let him know that he really do senthave to sell you on loving him or his looks. This is not necessary even if the story is true (Im kinda thinking its not, Im gonna guess he just wanted to point out the fact that other women may still want him) who cares so what some chick at work told him she adores gray hairs and wrinkles hahah! Go him thats his yea me for the week!|`|3eede3c6bfcae1014bd3454cd6dac5e1aa	he just wants attention, they like it when you get jealous|`|U2tkgYK6aa	have you ever made fun about his grey hairs and wrinkles, it is obvious that he is looking for you to say that you still find him hansom, its not as if she was admiring anything else|`|020600304fdab18bd45030f27f3c19adaa	Maybe he felt guilty so he wanted you to know to clear his conscience.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	My husband has both going on right now and it is sexy. It wouldn't make jealous in the same situation I would feel proud.|`|LUhh9bSWaa	Coolio!    I can't wait to get wrinkles and gray hair too.  That way the broads will be all up in my business more than they already are.    Woohoo....see folks...and youa'lls said there was nothing to look forward to in getting old.|`|b553da45b259fca50eed89cd57ec9ca6aa	haha.. yes.. when one begins to notice wrinkles, grey hairs, and parts hanging lower than they used to, they grab on to what compliments they can.. :)
y9CgveCGaa	It's just therapeutic.  Plus, it can't hurt to try.|`|AA10339039	lol...mine does the same thing.|`|pOLBKKNpaa	do you ever cry at a movie?    guess what . . . they're acting!|`|jTsQkuhHaa	LMAO!!!

If he's that into the show, he's already seen what he's yelling about!  Tsk, tsk!  The perils of testosterone poisoning!  LOL!  Enjoy his emthusiasm!|`|535a3fa30aef374c7339075d47316f65aa	MY HUSBAND must beleive they can, he yells all the time|`|G50ucmllaa	What are you talking about?  Women yell at the TV all the time.    "Don't go in there" "Turn around.  Run! Run!"  "Don't kiss him"|`|SzQi9N7daa	The answer to your question is YES!!  Its similar to when we talk to our wives neither one reacts!

So they all do that?!|`|szo81Rdxaa	of course dont you?|`|AA10461616	I do that but my husband doesn't.  LOL  It just means he is in a good mood and getting into it.  I actually yelled out loud in a movie theater for a dog to run so he wouldn't get shot.  People looked at me a bit odd and then they started yelling "Go!" "Oh nooo!" etc. with me.  LOL  Yes, I am an adult I am just animated and emotional about things.  I mean people who are into sports all gather together to watch it on huge TVs and yell like they are at the game or something- for HOURS.  That seems sillier to me.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Well, I only yell at the news, but I might be able to stop since George Bush II rode off into the sunset. Yes...|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	They can hear us. just like our sports teams can hear us when we yell at them also.|`|OgT00dW4aa	I find it endearing that men do that!  Some of women do it too.  Like when I watch scary movies, I'm might scream out, "Watch out, he's behind you".|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	Now that made me laugh...thanks, I needed that.
AA10395956	It means, they think you can be annoying, but in the cute kind of way.|`|1XmpLRueaa	He can read minds!!!!!|`|Cpp1LddVaa	It means that if anyone said whatever you said or behaved the  way you behaved, becoming annoyed would be the expected response.  However, because he is male and you are female -- and presumably younger -- generic annoying is transformed into  "cute" annoying.
nVMAOJd7aa	of course but in which way does he want you is the real question!?!|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	I'd say he recognized you and thought about going over and talking to you. I don't think he'd know you liked him if you haven't seen him in months.|`|EWyTbQOWaa	i think he likes you|`|ljSJSvv2aa	i think he is doing it becuz he likes you and he may think that you like him too|`|mxi85qsWaa	that could be the case but most likely it's because you haven't seen each other in months.|`|I1BW7YqIaa	Maybe he does like u?? To be sure pay attenion n see if he does it often if not he was probably looking at someone else.  Good luck hope I helped:)!!!|`|N0dBxV52aa	honesty is the best policy  haha  i thnk its because he ws like "o there she is i havnt talkd to her in awhile"  maybe he was thinking of wat to say if he caught up wth u after the game  and he probably was looking at u  just saying :)  he was probably just coming up with things to say and thinking about wat to do since u were there   :)  try to talk to him next time u c him|`|GiRQ7Vuhaa	its possible why dont you try talking to him|`|3Bfv6aUyaa	he was looking at your best friend.|`|969b1d6ecb8f3f15381cdfc44bfc106eaa	yesss|`|sYZecErDaa	Well he could think you like him or maybe he just really likes you.

vTCVg2Rlaa	get to know her on a personal level.because during your talks you may find things that u don't like. try a hint of flirting but not to much since you guys are just getting to know each other, and if you really like her follow your heart and you should know what to do next.                                                                good luck!!!!!|`|3ctchU2faa	Keep talking and find common interests between the two of you.

Be more nice to them and do some friendly stuff... If your friends hurt you, then don't consider them as friends anymore.... Friends are those who comes to you in times when you feel so sad... They are the ones who never leaves you even if you done something bad to them... They are forgiving unless you don't say sorry...|`|bUL2Pyx3aa	You made a good choice because you cant be friends with everybody. but still be nice because i speak my mind and really don't give a **** about what people think and my way works just find you chose.|`|eb7cd5109669ea133aab3557f5ad92feaa	keep it on normal level. Dont get into real relationships wth them and as u said, MYOB. but dont forget to give them the same love they gave u.
MO8SVvMdaa	lol ok.    fight back. who is she??
l4DpWVnBaa	Seriously, Who we surround ourselves in life ultimately affect us as individuals. When I hung around with those who were doing drugs and committing crimes, I found myself doing the same. When I was getting out of jail I had a choice: To back home, hang out with my friends and wonder if I could not get involved, or go somewhere else and start over again. I chose the latter. The best decision I have ever made.    What I am saying to you is while being young and the cool things are the  'tough ones' who seem real and know what they're doing. Odds are they are lost. You need someone who will lift you up as a person and call you higher in life. Everyone else is just a waste of time. What good is it for a person to who has the chance to excel, but misses because of their surrounding.|`|AA10938466	He will be in their for a while.I think you should find another guy.|`|AA11509733	u need a new man|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	what kind of people do you date damn everything about your life is messed up you let people feel on you like you got no sense you let negative thoughts run your life and everyday you come on here wanting to know if some guy is cute and now your so called boyfriend is in jail and you want to know when he's going to get out what is wrong with you kids nowadays get your priorities straight and stop living like you ain't got no damn sense|`|AYkEwqRXaa	He vioated his probation so he will be going away for a while this time.

NWH3MnE9aa	Hi, Sabre. Sometimes you have to get away from them for a few minutes -- maybe longer -- and cool off. Take a hot bath, read a book, Yahoo Answers. You'll cool off and feel better.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I usually go in the other room and cry. I hate getting angry, but sometimes it has to happen. Tears are for me to calm me down and release the tension, not from the hurt that caused the anger. Tears cleanse the soul and thus releases my anger.. I don't cry because of the fight, so don't think that. It's strictly to calm me down. Most times he never knows I'm crying. I don't want to give him that much satisfaction. I'm stubborn too! Ha!|`|agTCqkLDaa	I talk to him.  It helps.  We always say I love you before bed even if we're still a little on edge.  We both apologize when need be.  Usually, I just try and think about how happy we are together when not going through an argument/disagreement and then I feel bad that we even had one in the first place and I get that mushy feeling again.|`|zdpp7cubaa	Anger never melts away for me, but I usually help it leave by just remembering all the things I love about my fiance. All the good things he does, all the times he has helped, and I try to remember that he loves me. Then, after I have cooled down a bit we talk about it. It doesn't always work out that way though sometimes we get angry and strike out at each other.|`|81wvN8Rraa	It never just melts away I usually have to tell him exaclty what's wrong and after we talk about I can start feeling happier.|`|ZaQ6iQWMaa	We talk to each other about what's bothering us. I can't let things lie, or pretend what happened didn't. I have to let him know how I feel, and he does the same. We usually cry together and talk a while, and then love each other for listening. It's not always easy to hear, and we do fight pretty bad sometimes. But you gotta talk about it.|`|XwxuGMTDaa	i tend to walk away and ignore him and let him cool off then i go and deal with the situation.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Yell at him! My anger is usually well deserved so he might as well hear why I am angry with him!|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Take a bath.   And talk to him.

833d3998e43d4ddd7ca29670d85d6648aa	With a .45.  Just kidding!   Actually, you could violate the g-code & rat his junkie a@@ out to the po-po.  Then, he'll probably rat-out his dealers to save his own a@@, then they'll take care of him.  Keep your hands clean, sister.|`|U2tkgYK6aa	eh................ a baseball bat sounds about right to me. it would definitely irritate him. hope you succeed, you do not need that kind of crap in you and your kids lives..|`|yGwda7wPaa	If he is really a drug addict, then I would not let him see your kids anymore.  That would be the best thing for everyone.  Call the cops on him and get him arrested.  That ought to help.|`|47R03TbFaa	REPORT HIM AND STOP CHILD VISITS UNTIL HE CLEANS UP HIS ACT|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Cut ties and move away.  If he's a drug addict, he probably wont have the energy to care about finding you.  Leave him a note or call him to tell him that if he cleans up his life and proves he can be a good father, you can make arrangements for visitation.|`|yWUQUjx9aa	If you want him to leave you alone, ignore him.  If you want him to be angry with you and spend his spare time thinking about what a horrible person you are and how he is going to get back at you, then irritate him.    Does this make sense?  I see a man on crack.  I want him to leave me alone.  I poke him with a stick.  He gets irritated and leaves me alone?  Hmm....maybe not so much.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Why would you want to irritate him if you also want him to leave you alone?  How about bypassing the "I want to pi$$ him off" part of your question and just leave him alone?  If he's an active drug addict, his most significant relationship right now is with his drugs.  Leave him alone.  No need to antagonize him.  If he owes you child support, go through the courts and get his wages garnisheed.  Be the adult here, and don't behave like a rotten kid just to try to upset him.  Take care of your kids and be a good mom.
7osJ3T6maa	Hey, I understand why you would feel upset with your friend, but I definitely think you owe it to her to discuss this matter before just dropping her as a friend. To be fair, you did say that you were very aware that your friend gossips...did you ask her not to say anything when you told her this embarrassing story? That would seem like common sense to most people, but perhaps for some reason she doesn't doesn't think what she's doing is wrong. It seems that may be the case, especially if this has been the way it's gone for over five years.   Other than the gossiping, does your friend treat you well? That would also have a lot to do with how I'd handle this situation; is she worth it and do you think she has your best interests at heart? Maybe most importantly, do you think if you discuss this with her and ask her to stop that you can trust her to do it?   Good luck with whatever you decide!|`|3ctchU2faa	Send your friend an email about your feelings. Be respectful, but firm in how her behavior is straining your relationship. Explain how her spreading your story made you feel hurt and made her untrustworthy in your eyes. Put down any feelings you might feel about her gossipy ways, and tell her she needs to either find new material to discuss or you don't feel you can be friends anymore.  Don't do it over the phone or in person, because people tend to say more hurtful things and get carried away when doing that.|`|9AT3RPyVaa	well, that's a difficult question. i do believe that your friend should be given a chance to mend her ways and to heal your friendship with each other, then again you probably should have done this a long time ago. on the other hand maybe she isn't a good friend to begin with even though you've been friends for a long time. it really depends on your friend. i cannot determine whether she is worthy of the chance to stop throwing somebody else's private secrets into the open-air. the decision rests on you. i'm sorry i cannot help you more, but i'm just a young boy wanting to answer difficult questions. you have the obligation to do what you believe is the right choice. nothing is morally wrong about what you think is right.|`|f4x7V1sZaa	kick them in the face|`|zhL83fSlaa	Try talking to her. If she doesn't listen, don't tell your secrets to her.|`|kXFc00D9aa	Yes you should confront her in a calm and respectful manner. If you are angry or cross she will get defensive...she may get defensive anyway...main thing, either end the friendship or remain friends with her, but always know that she can't be trusted with certain information.|`|aDGcmvaMaa	Great description, first of all. I think you should confront her and tell her that you think her behavior is unacceptable to you or whatever. Then you make sure she understands that your friendship is in serious jeopardy over this and that she should really shape up. Yeah, I agree posting it on the internet??? OMG If she fights back, don't be her friend anymore, if thats what you wish. Do whatever it takes to make her understand the way you feel. Hope that helped!|`|G1V9Hvldaa	have you or someone else you know talked to her before? if so i would just stay away from her for a while and then if you do want to see her again then not tell her any personal information that you don't want leaked out for everyone to hear|`|odmW2elyaa	tell her that you do not think you can be her friend if she keeps it up that it is hurting you deeply ans just tell her how you feel
5Pyq34rsaa	Make an inside joke, inside jokes keep it personal and funny like iv earned Candy as my nickname, i have tons of candy in my purse whenever they c me they yell CANDY! we laugh and its fun 2 have an inside joke.

A lil group action seems to be what you need.|`|a5VLn2cWaa	nope. you two need to talk and decide what you both want.   It is only cheating if you agree to only see each other and then mess around.|`|Ah458EfWaa	sort of ; kinda; yea|`|DJeV7XQKaa	ok|`|bq98xZjcaa	it doesnt count as cheating technically...  but whats in the heart is different from whats in the head  shes messing with you.|`|QsoY8trZaa	If you're not together, how's it cheating?|`|bec77fe70053715a66b5fd7e555ab863aa	i think what it is would be called a "thing"  or an open relationship.  like where your not dating, but you have feelings for each other, yet you are free to go with other people if you choose.|`|oULsgDRJaa	No. You and her are just friends.|`|li9WGkzLaa	i wouldn't consider it cheating at my school we call that a special friend lol i have a friend who has a boyfriend and a special friend she has more fun as would say with her special friend so i would not consider it cheating|`|b05bKonnaa	two words: **** her    give her a "Hard time"    Its time for you to "Punch in"    "Holster" your "Weapon"|`|kkIVKvitaa	Yes. If she tells you she loves you and means it then she shouldn't be messing around with other guys.  She may see it as nothing but you should let her know how you feel about it.|`|bYeJVSDQaa	she is not in love with you if she is with someone else. you both need to talk about what it is. so far she is not your girlfriend so she can do what she wants. try being with another girl and see what she does.|`|HbWHkNBLaa	well it doesn't really count as  cheating because  you where never going out to begin with...i think its kind of a moral thing what you think is right or wrong|`|ebs0j7iaaa	maybe she is doing it to get your attention and make you jealous so that you will take the next step and be her boyfriend.  if she is the one that doesnt want to be together, then it isnt cheating but she doesnt want to be exclusive to you and you should maybe move on, or tell her how you feel.|`|itlydUdRaa	hell yea...she tells you she loves you, your just her friend wit benefits that means...  If you want to be with her, you have to tell her.  You have to tell her that you dont want to be that friend but her boyfriend  But thats if you want that|`|9LLKBKOmaa	Reverse the roles and put the question to her and you will get the answer to your question. On the other hand if you want to be exclusive just tell her that's the way you feel.|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	In a sense that is called love without attachment.  Your love is a freedom, you are not dependent on each other.
N2K1X6G3aa	You shouldnt of left her first of all. You left her thats what u did wrong.  maybe she didnt want to be touched but she wanted you to stay with her so she knows that you care. tell her your sorry and buy something special.

You can make up with her by apologizing and doing something adorable. :)    bridget.|`|N4GreuqEaa	when girl say leave me alone means..dont leave me alone and comfort me..    you should have asked her why she is crying..and if she keep saying leave her alone and tell her that u wont be able to sleep if u leave with out knowing what's bothering her..    just call her and say i couldnt sleep...just sweet talk her..that will work|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	Insensitive and mean? WTH.  You respected her wishes, it should be her fault.  You're too nice.|`|dwMcsOFpaa	when they say leave me alone and it wasnt you who got her upset, you're supposed to comfort her. the leave me alone was actually meant as a "please come near me and hug me".    trust me, im a girl and ive done that many times. its an attention thing. its not meant to be taken literal.|`|0ILT6jWLaa	you should have insisted and she did want you there w/ her maybe not touching her just there next to her. no it wasnt wrong just you didnt now what to do and you can make it up to her by always being ther for her and making sure she is ok but not to much thats not cool lol
w3tNq8npaa	She should pick Ryan.|`|j7o7RsZKaa	can I pick none???
EPTaL9Ajaa	Sounds like it.  He probably acts like he can't stand gay people so you're not going to suspect him.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Between the spanking and the calls I'd have to say he is at least curious. He probably gets defensive about gays because he actually feels like he can identify with them even though he doesn't want to.    You know there is a prob when he is fine with a man spanking him but gets upset when his own  wife does it!280 mins a day as well??That is overboard.|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	I dont want to point fingers but I have never known a straight man to spank another straight man.....

Good Luck!..|`|agTCqkLDaa	He might be bisexual which can be worked out.    He sounds a little curious.    I'm dating a bisexual guy (I'm a straight female) and even he doesn't go around smacking other guys's butts though...of course we agreed to be in a monogamous relationship; however, I'm pretty sure those marriage vows are supposed to cover that whole monogamy thing.    He probably thinks you'll leave him but he doesn't want you to, especially if he's bisexual.  He might not even know it though-sometimes it's latent.  It sounds like he loves you but that he's kind of confused.    Drop little hints like "hey, did you see that show about the bi so and so who was dating the so and so...how would you feel about that? Do you think it could work".  Even if that show never existed, it might get him talking.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	If he played sports, it's normal. It's a form of respect. Other than that, no, not so much...  I doubt your husband is gay. He's just got a good relationship with his co-worker/friend. ~ The multiple conversations... work-related? Don't over-react because of your friend's situation.

Me3Tsul0aa	Hey there,   I think this is great. He seems to be interested in you, by the way you describe it and I see that you both are shy around each other, which is common when it comes to these types of things. Maybe one day, when its just you two by yourselves, ask him something like "wanna hang out sometime? like do you wanna watch a movie?" I know it'll be random but his reply will let you know how he really feels about you.    If thats too hard, get that friend of yours to tell him that you like him.Tell your friend that you really like him and ask her if she can find out for you if he likes you too. If she's not being very helpful, then see if any other friend of yours knows him too. Otherwise, consider the first option of asking him yourself.    I know its hard but you know you have to make a move or you wont get anywhere with him.    I hope I helped.    Takecare and All the Best    XOXO

If you start uncovering his terrible secret, you'll eventually wind up in some sort of car chase. Just kidding, its porn. Now... the kind of porn he's looking at willprobbaly disturb you so give the poor guy some privacy. I'm sure you don't want him to snoop through your online... umm.. well... yahoo questions? What the hell, at least he has something to hide instead of asking people questions here.    Now if you asked real nice of how to undelete history and stuff like that... you might answer your own question. Then be forever sorry you ever looked.|`|cytK578caa	Please don't spy on your brother.

Its okay, don't sneak in on him, it wouldn't be right|`|Pxmhr8ynaa	Uhm, honestly...it's not that hard to figure it out. The kid's probably looking at porn of some sort. Now, don't freak out, I know that porn is taboo, but his realization of sexual interest is showing that he's growing up, and he'll probably hit puberty soon if he's the age I think he is. Also, him not telling you stuff is another sign of his maturing. While keeping everything from you is bad, so is telling you everything. It means he is becoming more independent, and is growing up. So stand aside and watch him bloom! It'll all be fine.    ...Oh, and if your brother is little, like 9 or under....that's not healthy. Try to put a system on his computer if you can (CyberSitter 9.0 works well) that blocks sexual or inappropriate stuff. Otherwise, it's really nothing to worry about. Sexual needs and masturbation are healthy parts of everyone's life, especially a growing young boy's life.|`|2cbjBOdOaa	umm how old is he??  and yes its porn! EWWWWW|`|Smgf5oFlaa	plz don't be asking questions like this and don't get all up in his stuff us guys don't want to fear our sisters are spying on our stuff if he's a teen then it's probably his hormones so if he's looking at you know what then just leave him alone he can't help it.|`|0nKeTB0Waa	porn or hes dating over the internet or he rapes ppl

But my girlfriend pulls them back in a headband, and lets a few fall over her forehead. I think thats pretty hot.|`|BL9CQgcAaa	bangs ftw|`|FZGNyoFtaa	Big forehead = Bangs are good.  Small forehead = Doesn't need bangs.
Cb5N6UaQaa	Give him a chance. There is nothing wrong in bgetting to know someone. The worst it could happen is that you don't hit it of.

da2KJ9fXaa	intelligent, if they were dumb then i wouldn't be able to have a smart conversation and if i went out with a dumb guy then i would feel weird being too smart.|`|T5ruXVlIaa	I also like the bad boys.

dGFrmyv5aa	Well, it's not everyday men are acting like dogs and peeing on what they want to call, their "territory." It's not that you meant it in a way of being loyal, but a girl looks at it as disgusting. She doesn't care if you are trying to protect her but how is she going to get rid of the piss in her couch, you know? She wants a boyfriend to take care of her like a tidy man would; not like a dog would.|`|8AcDVPI9aa	Honestly, I would be too, even though I know where you are coming from. To her, you pissed on her couch because you were afraid of losing her which made her feel like you didn't trust her enough to be loyal. Also she probably has to throw out the couch cushion now because it stinks.|`|zSdeMhvAaa	HAHA! its not her with the problom its u... what is your problom? HUMANS DONT DO THAT! u must be a dog.. no wonder she hates u! i wud...|`|6MOn3H8Yaa	haha...It like if she were to pee on your playstation (property). maybe you are intruting in her space|`|0505728aabf6d1f12318dd2e4d00717aaa	haha|`|LnzUMUCdaa	eww haha umm u peeded on her couch that explains itself|`|4qL7oRrVaa	It sounds like my german shepherd - always thinking he's the boss.    If your a calm-submissive guy, your gf will be always happy with you because she will be the leader - and you'll be very happy because you'll never have to think about the various trivial issues that come up.. like where to pee or what to eat, she will lead you to those things and tell you what to do and how, it can be a great life!    My shepherd used to be like you, now I'm the boss, and he's SO much happier for it!    Let her be the boss!|`|CcIasKaRaa	I HATE GUYS LIKE YOU!!! you give every guy out there a bad name, but the good news is when she dumps you *** and she will and she meets a guy like me she will far head over heels for me and you wil be sleeping on your piss stand couch
CtWTlQKlaa	Unfortunately if you want to talk to her now you are going to have to do it when she is in a group, otherwise she can accuse you of harrasment or stalking. You pry should talk to her in person that way you know that there is not some online communication problem. Just say "HI I get the feeling you are avoiding me all of a sudden. Did you block me on MSN? You know I really liked you and I thought you enjoyed talking to me but If you don't want to anymore thats fine the least you could do is tell me." And then stay there for just a few seconds, if she doesn't respond right away just turn around and walk away from her. Reverse psychology.|`|EfpnRLyUaa	dont tell her on the net, tell her in person, its makes you look more confident, but there could be an awkard moment, and just tell her, you have had feelings for her for the past year, but didnt want it to change your friendship, but you would like it to become a relationship, but its up to her, and say your not going to treat her differently now thatshe knows    good luck
ub6lxGPIaa	Well first off, NEVER ask someone out online, because what if they reject you? They might just have the proof right there on the screen. When u ask someone out or say that u like them in person, it's better because they can see u in person, and u can see her reaction, even if it makes u nervous    to talk to her, just kind of flirt with her, in brief periods of time, while she's away from her friends, like in hallways and stuff, but don't make it seem like u stalk her! Look natural, and don't try to fake anything! U shouldn't have to change anything to be with a girl!
Sih0xHJgaa	I think if you truly feel that that's how you were than there is no problem with apologizing. I'm sure he'd appreciate it. I mean it's not like you guys have to go out again but you can still be friends. I'm sure you'd rather be friends than have him think that you hate him.|`|hs04rG7daa	well just go up to him and say sorry and tell him you want to start a clean slate with him like new
YA4qCDukaa	arrogant huh? those guys are always a pain in the a**....  get him while you alone & say it...  'i kinda sorta like you'  it'll be scary, you'll probably chicken out the first few times (i did) & it will be the longest seconds of you life but who knows he might like you back.    good luck!!!  =)|`|U48HUZ5Kaa	Text him. That's what Teens do nowadays|`|Aw1Kd0eRaa	just tell him
mowvERi1aa	because they think they are hot and aj and tyler cant get anyon else cause tyler is to fat and aj is to self-centered and a homo....    ahh i like trevor |`|O7qu4DzSaa	Because of their look, talents, and style.
Fi8AIi4baa	So many guys are just like that.     Don't worry, there are a few of us who are different. If you wait long enough, I'm sure you'll find at least one.|`|mowvERi1aa	because they know they will do them and they like it and they think ugly sluts like karissa are hot even though they have a screwed up nose and even though some like sam are fat ...    nevermind i'm sorry.|`|fN23bHi0aa	Because if they are nice then girls call the fags and less of a man, etc.
4qL7oRrVaa	Yeah, a hair cut CAN change your lust for someone that badly.    Same thing happened with me and a guy at work, except when he buzzed his hair I noticed the severly retreating hair line!!    HA!|`|8pKyzuy3aa	Yes a haircut can change your feelings for your crush. lol. I had something similar that happened to me. I used to like this Italian kid in highschool. We were in the same grade, he was in some of my classes. He had gorgeous eyes and a cute smile, dark brown hair. Then one day he dyed his hair blonde. It looked really bad on him. and I wondered why I crushed on that kid.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Are you a shallow person?  It seems that you like him based on the physical appearance.|`|xvXoWX86aa	sounds like your a bit judgmental on someone who just made a mistake. Haven't you tried a new style and turned out horrible? nobody's perfect looking
ghLdIUz0aa	verryy good question, beacuse some people are just buttholes :] as a sister, she should be happy that this woman was told she could never have kids and now she is having a miracle baby.|`|rTibvdiVaa	I hope she has her babies the day of her sisters wedding.|`|8C1a8uhpaa	Not that I agree, but I have known some bride that only think about themselves on their wedding day. It's only one day for gosh sakes and it is a big deal but she should be happy for her sister and be glad that this miracle can be forever remembered in her wedding pictures. How these people justify in their mind what they do their own families is beyond me.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Sometimes I forget how mean women can be - and then I read stories like this and it makes me embarrassed for my gender.    There is no excuse for that kind of selfish, malicious behavior - none. And I feel sorry for the Bridezillas who are so caught up in getting everyone's total attention for their wedding that they ruin some of their most important relationships.    I'm glad you reached out to the upset woman. She should be totally thrilled about her twins, not shamed into tears by her horrible sister.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	They are immature and think that the pregnancy will somehow take the spotlight off of them as the bride. If it isn't all about them, then they get upset and mistreat others even though there is no rational reasoning for it.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	Some women get so caught up in "their" day and the "wedding of their dreams" that they forget to be human beings.    Your tale brought a lump to my throat.  My heart goes out to this woman you encountered for having had her sister treat her this way.  Instead of being thrilled to have her sister proudly show off her pregnancy, the bride is being a selfish ninny.|`|wGyDRhT7aa	Too many brides forget that they're bridesmaids are not their slaves and that while it's nice that they help out, it's not the law. How can a "slave" perform her "duties" if she's dealing with a pregnancy?! To top it off she'll probably have to get a different dress and stand out even more from the other non pregnant slaves which will totally ruin the brides pictures forever!     I'm being sarcastic. I have seen some brides on here say similar. Which is very sad. A bridesmaid should be there because you love them and you want them there with you. I guess others disagree, they choose their bridesmaids and suddenly their bridesmaids are no longer their friends or relatives, they are decorative robots in their wedding. And they must do their chores and look perfect while doing it.     You're a good person for trying to console a complete stranger. I send you a e-cookie.|`|TXddP0uxaa	My guess is, later the bride is going to apologize for saying such a hurtful thing.  I can understand though why this was her first reaction, though.   On her wedding day, she is supposed to be the center of attention.  It is the biggest day of her life.  Having her sister on the verge of giving birth to miracle babies is definitely going to take away from that to some extent.  Sure, it's selfish, but I think everyone is allowed to be a LITTLE selfish on their wedding day.  I'll agree that this bride went a little large in the mean department though.  Hopefully, that's not par for the course for her.|`|66393fcb8deb9226aa9427ed74300258aa	Wow how horrible is that bride? She should be happy that her sister was able to conceive at all after being told it would be near impossible. I hope their family gave that bride a good talking to about her selfish behavior. No bride has the right to be rude and belligerent about a bm or moh being pregnant at the time of the wedding. I get that it is a big day for them, but a pregnancy is just as big a deal. The whole "stealing the spotlight" routine is a bunch of bs because, imo, the attention will still be focused on the bride and not the pregnant woman. People that know the pregnant girl will already know so they won't be fawning over her you know? So I really don't get why some brides are so selfish that they have to be so negative about someone else's happy time.
Q2UDhYgkaa	I think they are just physically attracted to them and they think they are really feminine. Not all white guys like Asian girls.    The ones i know that like them say that asian girls are more feminine than white girls and they act in a more feminine way - they dont yell or argue much.    They also say that asian girls generally have better bodies - they like the even skin (instead of freckles etc), the fact asian girls dont get many wrinkles, the shiny hair and good teeth.    I think it's a physical attraction. It's the same as why some white girls love black men - black men can be more masculine than white men - they have good bodies and are well endowed haha.|`|I4ukTSFeaa	It is mainly physical attraction.  It is like a fetish.
fc37688f48f44a71f9de0ad8f18a0eaaaa	sounds like u have been through some deep sh*T  ..........im sorry hun    but thats life..... sh*t hapens and sometimes we just have to push through    here are my suggestionss:  1......... just try to get over him,,,i no it sounds hard and it is at first but idk i guess just give it time and ul be over him in a while. and as for other relationships....just take things slow and go at ur own pace and theres no rushh(:    2.............listen to ur heart. if ur heart wants him just kinda idk just let things be the way they are, and remain friends with him. he sounds like a good guy to have in someones life. u can have a relationship w someone and not be "in a relationship".         i hope i helped somewhat??? and i hope u end upp happy and finding a guy who truely loves u and wud never hurt you. trust me there is a guy out there like that for you(: i believe that everything happens for a reason and that everyone is born for someone, as in there are people who are made to be together we just have to struggle to find them through the bad and good, and that whole crazy ride we go on to find that person, well that is life((:   my heart really goes out to you, love. there are good guys out there, i promise. i i wish u best luck to find urs((:|`|5MxYOnzdaa	Honestly, Im going to say "be with him" but, only when the time is right. without doubt I know if your friendship is that long and you two are/were even that close... its all there. And, even when your heart is torn to shreds (trust me on this one) it comes back even stronger. You get a feeling of realization that there is more to life than fear of getting hurt again... live your life and let it go. I get the stitches factor is scary, but 20 years from now aren't you going to be wondering how things COULD'VE been with this man you love? Give love another chance. Tell him, let him know how serious you are... take that risk, let love in. adios. good luck.|`|2b17c80ce64ad216b8306152f28b338aaa	its called friends with benefits|`|qQvsmZqQaa	this is awkward

U3smeZ5caa	Nobody likes being completely ignored. But introverts need their alone time.    The primary difference between introverts and extroverts is how they recharge their batteries.    Their energy source: Introverts draw energy from their internal world of ideas, emotions, and impressions. They are energy conservers. They can be easily overstimulated by the external world, experiencing the uncomfortable feeling of "too much." This can feel like antsyness or torpor. In either case, they need to limit their social experiences so they don't get drained. However, introverts need to balance their alone time with outside time, or they can lose other perspectives and connections. Introverted people who balance their energy have perseverance and the ability to think independently, focus deeply, and work creatively.    Obvious characteristics of extroverts: They are energized by the external world by activities, people, places, and things. They are energy spenders. Long periods of hanging out, internal contemplation, or being alone or with just one other person understimulate them. However, extroverts need to balance their time doing with intervals of just being, or they can lose themselves in a whirlwind of anxious activities. Extroverts offer much to our society they express themselves easily, they concentrate on results, and  they enjoy crowds and action.    Introverts are like a rechargeable battery. They need to stop expending energy and rest in order to recharge. This is what a less stimulating environment provides for introverts. It restores energy. It is their natural niche.  (The Introvert Advantage, Marti Olsen Laney, 19-20)    Introverts are also usually lonely. He probably wants lovin' all the time. He just doesn't want to feel drained. Try spending more alone time with him! (not in public if possible)|`|0bGDcN0Iaa	it probably gives him more of a thrill of the game kind of thing like he needs to impress u to get u.|`|spWtg1Cmaa	That only works for a little while.

5p4cIVkYaa	Oh, puh-lease! This is something a girl like you seems to take care of EASY!     Okay, first of all, who cares what they say? You were probably the best girl in that room, it's their loss! They were either being racist or pathetic. Just forget it and move on because it doesn't matter what they say about you, it's THEIR LOSS.    If they keep doing it and you haven't told them to stop, well, step up and tell them to STOP, girl! It's just that easy. And if they still continue doing it, REALLY defend yourself now. If I were you, I'd say, (this would probably be a little rude - I can give QUITE a cold shoulder, but anyways...) "I'd rather be this kind of girl than be YOU guys, so back off!" - It usually works for me, so I say, try it.     And the last one!: Here comes the old "Let's be mean to this girl so she won't know we like her!" scandal. It's simple - ignore them and just do what you normally do and leave them be. If they keep on picking on you, then, and they obviously seem to be crushing on you, instead of being rude, say, "If I'm so unappealing to you as you say, I'm flattered that you even bother to annoy me."

anaaY9DRaa	1. making him jealous never works out like you want it to. never date another guy to get the guy you really want. though it sounds like  cool idea, it always ends in disaster. flirt as you may, though not over the top, but never date another guy to get the man of your dreams. you shouldn't have to use other people to get to him.     2. stop acting like just a friend. i know hanging and making nasty jokes is so much fun. believe me i do. you feel like no one is judging you because you're "just one of the guys." plus you are closer to him. well being "just one of the guys" may very well be your problem. if you don't want to be just friends then you don't need to act like just friends. if he can see you as a dating prospect instead of just one of the guys, your chances for stealing his heart are higher. now don't throw yourself on him or anything, and stay chilled, but act a little bit more as if you two aren't football watching, perverted joke making, laugh out loud partners. show him a new witty feminine side that is approachable but irresistable.     3. Don't act as though he is the only guy in the world for you. this will make you seem a bit too clingy and a lot of guys run away from that. flirt a bit with other guys, don't make the fact that you like him too obvious. this will help him realize A: that if he starts to like you, that he has competition, which means move in on her fast. B: you aren't obsessed and don't pose a big spider web of commitment.    4. show your sexy side. by being friends he has probably thought less and less about your physical appearance. though this shouldn't matter it can help. remind him how attractive you really are! he may be blinded by friendship and has forgotten what a hot friend he has. i'm not saying dress like a skank but maybe do a little sexy style mix up and come to school with a refreshing, slightly mind blowing new look.     5: get some more alone time so he can see you shine through.     6: Extras:      A: be confident: if you were comfortable around him before, ther is no reason to be stressed now.      B: don't put pressure on him. there harder you push the harder he will push you away.      C: be patient. good things come to those who wait. this may take time. i know its hard to wait when your man is right there, but try to take things slow and let the possibilities sink into his mind.      D: he may not be the perfect guy. if he doesn't end up liking you, im sure someone out there will soon. there are lots of fish in the sea and some things are just not meant to be. i know, easy for me to say, but i've been through the same thing      E: finally, if he says he doesn't like you be understanding and stay friends. who knows, later down the road he may like you and if you are a raging mad woman who is angry with him for not loving you then he probably will run away asap.    i wish you the best of luck and i sure hope this helps. i know how you feel right now. just be patient, be natural, and let the pieces fall with a little help from the advice above.|`|FxpE8ivMaa	touch him when ever u can.  kiss him on the cheek, surprise him.  anything physical will get me or any other guy going.|`|z8WIAhDVaa	If you want him to notice you, start to look and smile at him more.  Look like your having fun without him with your friends!  Good Luck, Have fun!|`|2VAHKxh7aa	Good scenario.  The question isn't how to get him jealous, it's how to get him to feel the same way you do.    If he already knows you like him, you need to make sure it's not too obvious.  Sometimes it can be a good thing if the boy knows you're crushing on him but he might also think you're too available or easy.  Ignore him a bit and just give him a smile or a nod if you pass him.    Make it seem like your crush on him is fading and wait for him to try and start things up again.|`|LqJrPYHGaa	i don't suggest making him jelous cuz if he liked u back this is wut he would be thinking : "she likes someone else, i might as well move on.."  try giving him a friendly hug every once in a while :)|`|TxcpzRdRaa	...Make out with another boy at your lunch table.    NO. That is not a good idea. Really, honestly just be yourself! If you want him to notice you instead of the other girls, take a (legitimate) interest in something he likes, spend some one-on-one time with him...and assert yourself. If he has some strange passion for World War 2 movies, then ask him if he wants to go see the newest one out in theaters. Or whatever. Spending time alone will make him notice you, and doing something he likes will make him think you're not just like every other girl who only thinks of herself and just will drag him to the mall shopping and to see chick flicks all the time. Guys like to know that you will do stuff they want and stuff you want, too. Soo...yeah.    Or...just go with the first plan. It depends on if you want to hook up with him or actually have a relationship.|`|OKIp6GsUaa	Make yourself look different then everone else.=D  Thats what i did.|`|ZJg26cAmaa	noo thats a friend zone dont go there.    start talkin to him a little less and being more flirty  tickle him,poke his sides etc       nough said im out  peace!|`|AqHm4IQyaa	Start really hitting on him.|`|oNhIoVLIaa	Flirt even more...like get more playful (touching his arm, etc.)  and even flirt with other guys around him, it should make him jealous and realize that you are a girl that other guys want! :)

AaoclPYCaa	Wow that is really cute!  I bookmarked the page.  I don't think the bride would care if you made it yourself.  I think I will make these for my bridesmaids to wear at my wedding.  Thanks for the pattern!|`|ZfleGhXLaa	I think that's a great dress!    If my MOH was capable of sewing her own dress, I absolutely would not mind if she did so.  I would of course want to have some say in the pattern she choose.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	I can't imagine why she would care if you sewed the dress yourself.  There is no reason to care, especially since you have experience sewing clothes.  It might be a different story if this were to be your first sewing project.|`|7b9eE1icaa	That's a cute dress, I wouldn't mind at all.|`|rTibvdiVaa	if you have sewn then I think everything will be fine. maybe you should offer yourself to do the other bridesmaids dresses since you are low in cash and that way all bridesmaids can match win-win situation. the dress is very cute and it does not seem to be to hard to make....    edit:oops sorry you never said you were low in cash but you can still make some money off of them.|`|RDETL6afaa	My bridesmaids were sisters, and their mother made their dresses!    It was great. I picked out the fabric (some sort of satin) in the colour that I liked, and paid for several metres of it. Through talking to them and their mum about what style I would like, they gave me a shortlist of patterns and I chose one. Then their mum made the dresses herself!  They looked fantastic.     If your FSIL is as laid back as I am, she'll be fine with it. She has already given you a bit of a run-down on what she would like, so when you get a few ideas together present them to her and see which ones she likes.    I like the kimono pattern, but it also depends on what suits your body type..|`|1KfbgBupaa	If their sewing skills are very good I'd have no problem with them making a dress to wear.|`|AA12240708	i personally wouldnt mind but you said that she wanted it to be floor lenght so just make sure it is. i think it would be very beautiful. also my moh couldnt afford an expensive gown so she asked me if i would buy her dress instead of giving her a bridesmaids gift and i did that.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	No I don't like that and would not allow my MOH to do that.  Buy the dress everyone else is, what's the problem with that.  Depending on how your creation turns out the bride would probably prefer you just buy it.  It's one of the duties of being an MOH/bridesmaid, forking the bill for the dress.|`|84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	One of my maid of honors (I have two of them) might make hers. We most likely have to get them made anyways so she said she could make hers which I didn't mind at all. She might go ahead and make all of the dresses. lol  She's a fashion design major (she recently graduated) so I trust her.|`|sMUiGFPraa	Go for it, it's really cute!|`|HOK5C8n4aa	If they can sew, I wouldn't care.  I have a friend who is very talented at that and she could make my wedding dress if she wanted.  As long as you are capable of the task, I don't see how she would mind.  You might offer to show her the finished product so you have her approval, but if you have the skills, there shouldn't be a problem.    The dress you plan on making should be okay, as long as it is long and doesn't show stomach and isn't too low cut.  In a nice material, that dress could be quite lovely.
VBFwT9nVaa	Well you need to meet the right guys then, a lot of guys hit on any girls that are friendly with them, and they take it as a sign of interest and tend to get overly friendly. Just keep being yourself and someone's bound to like you for who you are, you sound like an intelligent, sophisticated, friendly girl, I wouldn't mind getting to know you =).
jD0nfrIBaa	Yikes, this is a touchy situation.  If they are best friends, then I can see how they would do that, but at the same time...I can see how it upsets you, coming from one jealous girlfriend to another.  A few weeks back, my boyfriend had me look at his email for something, and while I was on his account, I saw an email from a girl I knew he used to be good friends with.  They never dated, but I knew she had had a crush on him (never met her though).  I know I shouldn't have, but I couldn't help it.  I read it.  There were quite a few of them, and I knew my boyfriend wouldn't care at all (he gives me his passwords to everything), so I took a loot at them.  In a few, he had signed it "Love you like a sister."  Well, I saw the word love, and was kinda jealous for a minute.  But also, when I read the emails, I was basically reading all this stuff about me because they brought me up constantly---all amazingly good things.  So in the end, I wasn't bothered by it at all.    Anyway, sorry to ramble on.  His best friend is a girl.  That's kinda weird.  My boy's best friend is a girl, but that's me, so it's okay.  He isn't close at all with any other girls.  We've both distanced ourselves from people of the opposite sex because we are both so jealous.  For her to say something like that, I think may have been a little disrespectful if she knew how jealous you guys were, but at the same time, she may have meant it in a complete sisterly way, I dunno how close these two are.    You might bring it up to him, just maybe say something about how that message made you a little uncomfortable.  I've gotta give you props to being okay with him going to a concert with some girl.  My boyfriend wouldn't even think to ask me something like that, haha.  It's not that I don't trust him (because I do completely), I would just prefer him not to hang out with other girls like that (and vice versa with me and other guys).    Just talk to him about it.  Don't get mad, just say you didn't like that very much.  Maybe he can mention that to this chick, and she won't be so forward anymore.  Make sure you reassure him that you trust him completely.  How would he feel if he read somewhere online a guy saying "You're my bestest friend and I just love you so much!" to you?  Ask him that and it will put it all in perspective for him.    Good luck!|`|40cb05167045a1f46df282f984b699d4aa	Don't be jealous, he doesn't like her the same way he likes you.   I am best friends with a guy, and he has a girlfriend. She's super nice, and she knows that he & I are not ever going to be much more than BFF.   I leave him messages like that all the time.  But it's more of an "i love you like a brother" than an "i love you like a boyfriend."  so don't worry!  but if she's doing it because she knows about your jealousy issues, then you know she's trying to tick you off, and she probably likes him as more than a friend.  good luck!! :)
sHBPfItfaa	Okay, Your not sure if shes gay. Why dont you ask her if she is? or is willing to try something like that, just in casual conversation. If she says no, then theres your answer, she says yes.. then persue that :) Not sure if this helps at all, but if a gay girl asked me something like that i would be totally honest. Another thing you could ask is IF she has ever had a gay incounter before? that could help you too.    answer mine? :)  recent questions in my profile.|`|rAkWoweOaa	You didn't say if she was Gay.

Depending, if you want to have a relationship with her, you should try if she's willing. I'm not against lesbians or gays but I'm not with them. If she's just wanting to be a close friend, keep it that way, don't push her to do anything serious... you should ask her if your so curios|`|AATmqYQ1aa	I don't see what is stopping you from asking her out...DO you know that you like girls or are you unsure of her?     I can tell that you guys both have a thing for each other so why not give it a shot? You said that you know it's going to end badly...how do you know that? Because you're a girl and she's a girl?    Now I'm confused.    Give it a try...if it doesn't work then it didn't work...you never know...she might be the one.    When I barley started going out with my girlfriend I never thought we would last this long ( 8 1/2 years) but I'm so glad that we did give it a try.    Good Luck!

s7UZZbVhaa	this is my philosophy:    love isn't really about your body or weight, it is about relationship and affection, romance.    if you want your lover to be physically attracted to you, you should make efforts to get in shape. if that isn't an issue to you or her, don't worry. it all depends on what you want out of this relationship.    if it is her that you find with the weight problem, you have to decide whether or not it will get in the way of you loving her. sorry i misread your question before.
eFXD3Qzcaa	There is really nothing you can do to make him love.  Some dudes really love someone but don't show it.
C7tAESsBaa	Sounds like your in a tuff spot. I think she likes you but may not be ready for anything serious. If you can delete the "i love you with your nick name" that might be a good idea. If she took hers off she may be more worried about what others are saying instead of what she's feeling.  Good luck and please guard your heart.

(Unless you did, in which case I think you should put a tiny piece of it in the cat poopy and show him - look kitty did it!)|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Should a grown woman have a cat?    Sorry that didn't come out right =X (redfaced)|`|oDGttkmLaa	Once I threw all my husband's soccer stuff out the door into the front yard.   He doesn't ask questions any more.  Yours wouldn't either if you started poisoning him a lil bit every day. Gotta keep them in line somehow right?|`|020600304fdab18bd45030f27f3c19adaa	^^^ Agree with mace|`|DzIlM76Xaa	I'm partial to a 12 inch "Evil Ash" action figure.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Hehe everyone likes something, be glad it's star trek and not porn lol =) When he's calmed down, just say "honey, I didn't break your toy, and I think it's cool that you have a hobby."  Or something. I know me and my husband were listening to a radio show where a guys wife sold his baseball card collection for like $20. He acted like I'd do the same, and I just said "I would NEVER mess with your hobbies and collectibles" And he grinned pretty widely, it was adorable. He's got all kinds of stuff too, so I think he liked that respect.|`|TlcMyJeuaa	Wait a minute....was it a model of the NCC-1701, or the NCC-1701D?  Or was it maybe the NCC-1701E?  The E was a limited production and is highly valuable.|`|cb9626d7fa143d0ce804d5d769640d45aa	he should thank you for throwing it on the floor and breaking it. what kind of ungrateful husband is he? don't bother trying to convince him that the cat did it - you've been blaming the cat for everything lately and he isn't buying it anymore.|`|Ef83kV3Qaa	I thought we were in this together. You better now say a word or you will be sleeping in cat litter for the next 6 months|`|8a262a9c5496ee057e063ab90852f0c4aa	*shakes  head sadly*  You did it, didn't you?  People who break Star Trek models deserve a visit from the Salt Monster.|`|tQUTJxCsaa	Seriously the fact that he has a star trek model and has a job at the same time is quite a remarkable thing.|`|LTfVmNOEaa	Does he have the proof.... no!    Do you have an evil identical twin sister?  you could give that a go, he might fall for it|`|mjyRcxUHaa	Every Grown Man has his weakness, mine husbands is a 1969 Pontiac, which was off limits until after 10 years of marriage.  Now the kids dent it and it's not that big a deal, I've even driven it.     Most likely he is overreacting because you've been giving him grief over it, so he is defensive.      Explain to him that you didn't do it, the cat did. Offer to find a way to protect these things.  They have cubes, a locked cabinet whatever you two can come up with.    Then you need to chill, I know it bugs you, think about me and the car that I couldn't even breathe on.  He'll eventually let it go and realize there are more important things.  My husband finally realized he would rather have his kids in the garage with him then to not have them there and protect his precious car.  Just be glad his hobby is alot smaller.  I have a garage that can fit 4 cars in it and my minivan has never been in there, and I live in MA.  Do you have any idea how much it s@@ks cleaning the snow off your car all the time?? Count your blessings!!    When he is not around tell the cat I said "good job". And please buy him/her a treat. LOL !! Yes, I know I'm mean!!|`|833d3998e43d4ddd7ca29670d85d6648aa	Ha Ha Ha!  My retard ex had a stupid alien spaceship that my kid took a little baseball bat -to it.  Blame it on the cat, good one!  I said it must have fallen from the pushpin when he stuck it into the ceiling. What's up with these guys anyway?

aa1b714111411c497a6d36c7701a1d23aa	Looking for work is the practical thing to do, but also take this time to reflect on the decisions you have made and plan for what you want to do in the future. Seek support from your family. If you would like to talk about it you can email me if you want.|`|gkqlc9qraa	Pray to God, He will help you get back on track.|`|xXt6W17Faa	Start reading Manga and Watch Ouran High School Host club|`|AS8V9rAFaa	Look for a job close enough to where you live so that it won't be a problem that you don't have a car or license. I know it seems like a really hard time to get a job right now but if you just work really hard and apply to as many places as possible, hopefully something will work out. Plus, getting a job is a great way to make friends, I know I made a lot of good friends at the movie theater I worked at in high school. I hope everything works out for you
v6a0Hfudaa	hm well. i know its gay to prop hear this all the time but yer both young. if hes a cheater he would do the same to you. you like him cause he tells you everything. and that brings you closer to him. but the only advise i can give you besides forget it cause i know you wont is give it time. because yer both so young whose to say this isnt just a stage of his life he is going through cause he is a young guy. he might be diff later on in life and you guys will become even more closer as friends. and its a scary thing to do but there is nothing better than being with yer best friend in the end. so wait it out just continue to act and be his friend only and eventually he will realise all that you have been there fer him. and if he dont then who needs him and at least yall are still friends. one last thing also.... your feelings may change fer him in time to, you never know. so remain his friend ONLY and wait it out fer now.    i know all this cause im in love wit my best friend too. and he is a major play boy too...lol|`|htMOl3c4aa	virgin lips? hahaha|`|I2amoo6Kaa	BY THE WAY YOUR TO YOUNG anyways happens allot when your friends with a guy thats your friend you'll like him and then you'll get over it and then you'll say to yourself you know what why did i ever liked this guy|`|HCWkdk4naa	do not waste yourself on him|`|oJPn5Rgtaa	because he's confident probably|`|Ksilu2Zyaa	If all those girls like him they must like him for a reason.....Your subconscious mind knows this and pumps emotions of attraction into you. Even though this guy will ruin you.|`|KcYaPYhhaa	I think you should move on. He's not worth your time. He will try to pressure you into things, get you in trouble, and he's just gunna cheat on you. He's not a decent guy. Leave this one behind.|`|lk2pL6osaa	So, what's your question?|`|rd5468H1aa	Move on, or you'll end up getting hurt.|`|dIma3KxIaa	its called ''i like the bad boy type'' dont worry it happen to me too dont worry it would be going away soon but dont fall for him that species are dangerous lol|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	It's because he tells u his secrets.|`|tbQX8bRGaa	you must be attracted to the bad boys tsk tsk  i say keep him as a friend don't go any further until he matures and grows up then start up the laddder from there|`|AA10934463	get someone else and stay his friend youll kno  who not to look for hes an butt  face|`|35d2zC5Faa	PLayers are charming and he's charmed you. Just remember that's all it is and nothing more. You deserve better. I used to work with a guy who played every girl at work. I was the only girl that didn't sleep with him. I admit, I was charmed by him as well. But in my head, I knew what he was. So I made him all ga ga over me. And then I broke his heart. Oh, how fun it was to watch the player get played!!|`|f8c5c19cb27ce51454af3ecf7d02fe43aa	what a loser u must be.  cant u find another guy?  u know what hell want.  hes a jerk...just cause u guys were best friends doesnt mean ur exempt from his cheating and uneccessary advancements.  its not worth it.  at all.      turn mean instead, its worth it:  http://www.beingmean.webs.com    xoxox|`|QsoY8trZaa	Because you don't believe you deserve better?|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	you're attracted to his confidence and skills and his looks.  you shouldnt like him cause you know you'll get hurt by him, so you should try not to spend time with him|`|a9DjyK7gaa	You have no idea how to spell nevertheless what you are talking about, shut up.|`|ZJg26cAmaa	lol you must be trashy if you like a guy like that.    wait a little and grow up first ...|`|EgLTmiTjaa	im askin myself da same question...grls i kno wuld be completely turned off by tht|`|mbn1PmdBaa	Because you're very close to him.

It doesn't work that way, one is always attracted to the other. And you're the fool in this situation, to tell you the truth. You like him because you have gotten to know him, generally when someone open up to you, you like them. You're young, this sort of stuff happens all the time. You just need to forget about him. He sounds like an absolute tool, and he's no good for you as a friend or as something more. Ditch the guy!|`|QNdJ5Rinaa	i don't think he's the 1 for u cuz basically what you see is most likely what you'll get. and the girls he messes with probly think that they are the missing piece in his life also.
sWFIJtGmaa	Well I do know some old couples who have been together since high school, then got married, and now at age 80 are still as in love as they were in their freshman year. But that is very rare these days.  Things aren't the same as they were back in the good old fashioned days. But it is still possible. There is no minimum or maximum age. Whatever happens, happens. Dont base your life around a boyfriend tho. Wait until you get married to make those decisions. And do not get married until after college. Please. Even if you are with the boy in high school and during college that you think you want to be with for the rest of your life, stil wait to get married until after you graduate college. Because college and high school are the hardest times to have a relationship in. With all the drama, and tests, and parties and promiscuity and immaturity. If you can stay together through that, then you can do anything :]  But you are still young and don't know exactly what you want. Trust me. There is a boy out there that is perfect for you, but yo ustill have to find them.  All the boyfriends you have now are just there to help you discover what you like about boys, and to practice your relationship experiences on them.|`|915705d92192ca14561aef0c15a747e6aa	yes, very very well in love.|`|FTZ8kQ9Qaa	i firmly believe in love under 16,,im thinkin that i gots it too and im only like 12...now like...a 10 year old is too young....and some does revolve aund wether the boy is mature or not.|`|sc203Lb4aa	I believe that people under 16 can be "in love," but perhaps have not tapped into the deep feeling that love can inspire until their brains have fully matured (mid-late 20's, I believe. Somewhere around there).    There is no true age restriction on love. People can feel it of all ages. But the extent is limited, I believe. You cannot have reached the deepest feeling of love until you have matured fully.|`|tO8ey3o8aa	i think theres a certain level that we teens can go  ur probly there (i am too)    check out Young Love by Chris Brown|`|e1F55L7aaa	I believe in love at first sight. I don't think that there is age limits on love but i do be live that if you do find love at a young age, its going to be rare and not likely, but there are probably a few cases of love at a young age.|`|hnTDf3wNaa	why does people say that you have to be 16 or older to be in love its just a age and some guys that age can be immature & i m in my teenage years not 16 & i think i m fallen in love with a guy|`|AA10934463	i think thats to young and i think that  when you have a job and take care of yourself and are mature only then will you find love. and its not love its infatuation be with that same person everyday for atleast 5 years then tell me if your in love|`|kkIVKvitaa	There is no age limit on Love.  But your oppinion on it might change as you grow older ar as you gain more experiences.   I think Love is the uncontroable feeling of wanting to be with someone.  If you really care about someone your age really doesnt matter.  That does not apply to sex. Love and sex are different and should be handled differently.

TxcpzRdRaa	Join a club or something and meet some new girls. Clearly the ones you know have an under-appreciation for computer skills. No seriously, I dated a guy like that in high school...nice kid...it didn't last, but there is hope for you. Girls like that kind of stuff, but you've gotta find the right girls. A lot of them are impressed by it. Probably something like an after school club, or a religious organization (youth group or whatever). You won't find cute, interested girls hanging out at the mall, or in the same group of friends you always hang with. Go meet some! Good luck!!! =)|`|zwdGBrUZaa	maybe u arent looking in the right places  when you least expect it you'll find some girl|`|FyhzmgRUaa	the best technique is to be yourself|`|P38ULZbraa	I wrestled in high school too - the only girl [: I hate Valentines Day too, and I have a fiance! Just wait, I'm sure an amazing girl is going to come into your life that's worth waiting for. Just try to have fun being single. I know it sucks on V-Day seeing everyone with their partners, but make the best of the day, maybe ask out a girl that you like. Time will tell. Good Luck.|`|pHbVh9kIaa	maybe u shoud look more around u, i mean if u r that nice as u say, there will be plenty of girls wanting u, i guess u should ask a girl out, even if u dont like her much so it will put u on roll, maybe a girl is likngg u but u just dont see or ask her out!!!!|`|2ca9a87135087d38a7252d24603b5e86aa	Of course! When there's a wheel, there's a way.    You've got plenty of ways to attract girls but I think you'd  put all your efforts unto these leisure and forgot to live  like everybody else.    Refine your manners, softens your ways, dress moderately,  be friendly and smile so that the world will smile at you!     For smiles adds value to your face!|`|ou7GQWh3aa	any (if not all) of the above, but there's also the chance that love is sitting right under your nose and you haven't noticed her yet.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	go to mexico and bring one across the border, ill gurantee you , you wont have any trouble finding a girl you may even  end up with a haram. good luck.
z8WIAhDVaa	The point of life is to live it, don't always think about guys.. enjoy some friend and family time. If it makes you upset, try to ignore it, if you really need him, get back together. You WILL find somebody that is PERFECT for you, just wait, you'll see.|`|qfgb1eNpaa	i think that that is life's mystery and is not meant to be found out. it is part of enjoying life. the mistakes in life are what form you as a human being, and create your life path. without the mistakes or the bad situations, life would be totally different, and personally, i think it would be pretty dull.|`|NRWR0POFaa	Well at least people like and want you. I've been rejected so many times I just don't bother anymore.
FVDTXM68aa	Hun, if the guy isn't married, he is fair game! ;) Who knows, he could be "the one!" Have fun and flirt! Gesh, flirting will be easier w/o his gf around!! :) Good Luck, sweetie!! :)|`|hDAoKmjPaa	you should wait till he is single. do not flirt with him when his lady is there that will only cause drama and probably get her mad at him then maybe and most likely get him mad at you because his lady is mad at him over you then you probably wont have a chance if he is mad at you. if a guy is taken girls should just back down... if he does become single then i say go for it...but dont go trying to break them up.|`|Anzu2Nr4aa	wait it out.   you don't want to come on too strong..  plus if you flirt NOW he might not like you or respect you when he gets out of his current relationship and is starting to look for the next one.|`|vQmb8XZPaa	if he has a gf u need to chill but be the best friend girl.. can u help me with mine???|`|tF9Hq23daa	flirt and flirt ur lil butt off.    u flirt as hard aas u can and dont worry about any one else.  hoope it works out|`|zXIIYbzBaa	Thats mean..............Leave hima nd his girlfriend alone and don't make a bet that they are going to break up, just back away. It's not important to date  this guy it's not like your looking for your husband!|`|BJNJgPuEaa	you should never flirt with a guy who has someone...i hate girls like you|`|3UEyha0Xaa	your going to get your *** kicked so just wait|`|wajUdvXRaa	I think u should chill and wait out the relationship. You shouldn't have to flirt to get him to notice you b/c your personality should just shine through. And besides when both u and your friend flirt with him"who gets the guy"?!|`|WEsFpJ7Haa	This is like the ultimate love triangle.    If you don't want any confrontation or fights between this gf and your best friend i recommend you lay off. sadly girls get extreme when it comes to prevention of relationships. things like these can break great friendships that could have been better than most things.     in the end most guys are pigs, so don't mess up your friendship for a relationship that'll only last a month or so, just wait it out and you'll find a way better dude, i guarantee it.

If she is snobbish then maybe not. : /    You should try talking to her in person to see if she is still mad.|`|MG7CLjtjaa	Yes and yes. That's soo sweet of youu =)|`|I2amoo6Kaa	ok biy listen to my steps and then she will forgive you i helped so many people she'll prob forgive you but if she will she would call u or somertin but try this out it will HELP TRUST ME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!Step 1:  Create a custom desktop background. Snap a picture of yourself looking appropriately remorseful and holding up a handwritten sign that says "I'm Sorry." Colorfully decorate the sign with pictures, borders and other artwork. Upload the picture onto the computer of the person you are trying to apologize to. Go to the computer's control panel and select "Change desktop background." Choose your apology image file. Put the computer to sleep, so that the next time the recipient sits down at the computer, she receives your apology.  Step 2:Create an apology CD. The first track on your CD should be an audio recording of your apology. Explain how sorry you are and that you created this custom CD to communicate your apology. The rest of the songs on the CD can either be a compilation of the recipient's favorite songs, or a collection of songs that relate to the idea of being sorry. Send the CD by regular mail or personally drop it off at the recipient's house.  Step 3:Apologize through food. Bake a cake and use frosting to write "I'm Sorry" on top. Order pizza and have the restaurant bake a special pizza that spells out your apology using toppings. Create a special dinner for the person you are apologizing to and arrange the vegetables on his plate to spell "I'm Sorry."  Step 4:Create a custom apology video. Using a camcorder, shoot an original video of you apologizing. Add special touches such as reciting a poem that is appropriate for what you are trying to say. Sing and perform a song to demonstrate just how sorry you are. Use Windows Movie Maker to add special effects and unique touches to your video. Burn it to a DVD and mail it to the person you want to apologize to. You could also insert the disc into the DVD player so that the next time she uses it, your apology plays across the TV.  Step 5:Have a pet deliver your apology message. Write a note containing your sincere apology. Punch a single hole in the corner and slide a ribbon through it. Attach the ribbon and note to the collar of the cat or dog. Your apology will be delivered the next time the recipient pets the animal.Tips & Warnings  Take the time to use your imagination to create a personal way of apologizing. Whatever method you choose, the most important element of your apology is its sincerity.The unique element of surprise is what adds to the charm of an apology. As you plan and create your apology, make sure the recipient doesn't find out about it|`|ddWyRjmVaa	cute. really.  but just talk to her!!|`|rydsklvWaa	Yeah it was cute, but a little lacking. You should have called her that night and asked if she got your teddy bear, and if she was willing to forgive you.|`|rCc5uBDTaa	awwweee.  that is pretty sweet.  but its up to her dude.  try calling her.  and try talking to her in person.  but yeah, that is super sweet.  :P|`|tO8ey3o8aa	thats sooo cute!  call her anyways|`|cr1cUCKVaa	v v cute. so adorable!. i'll forgive you. jst become legal and call me hehe|`|xhVe918waa	Awww, that seriously was a cute way to apologise :D    I think she might forgive you. =]|`|fEcNMm05aa	Ahaha, aw.   Yes =]    If she's been missing you, it probably won't take much more than that.  Unless she was REALLY upset with you over it.    GoodLuck|`|RzeYy8dTaa	It is cute! Now explain to her what happened and you lost it but it had nothing to do with her.  Remember that she has trust in you to be the protective person while she is with you.Take a run or walk next time to relieve the stress.she is there for you to talk to.  Things like this can leave a mark on your relationship.Being out of control.   Maybe try calling her ask if she will talk with you.  By the way I'm happy you assumed the responsibility.It shows you have good values.|`|Vmbqn9XWaa	Aweeeeee    i think thats a cute way to apologize!   if i were her, id sooo forgive you! im a sucker for stuff like this! XD    hope she forgives you! good luck!!|`|QsoY8trZaa	Awwww....I would. That's sweet.|`|Ah458EfWaa	it was a very cute way 2 apologize and she might 4giv u|`|AA11618542	It was a very clever way to apologize, and very cute too! I'm sure she's already forgiven you...maybe she's expecting you to call her. Try calling her and see how it goes. Good luck! =]|`|mQGfobADaa	Awwwwww;  How friggin cute!!!  :D  She should..  and give u a make out session.  LOL.  Just kidding.  Im a girl.  Not a perverted dude.  xDD  She will forgive u:D|`|ssiqDLKsaa	yesss that is adorablee and i think she will forgive you    just give her a lil bit of timee and talk to her|`|N4GreuqEaa	very cute* hehe...dont wait for her to call you. she's probably wan to call you but it might be hard for her to call you like u wanted to see her.. give her a call..|`|4RLjQ4M4aa	a and b. if my boyfriend did that for me i would be going insanely giddy. no offense, but your gf is crazy if she doesnt think shes lucky to have you.|`|El36zZEYaa	Very Cute! and really sweet.  Now follow up with a call (honestly apologizing with details about how stressed you were) And yeah of course she'll forgive you.|`|R4q2cHN1aa	it dpends on what you like yelled at her. and its cute but in a cheesy kinda way :) ya know? id be like omgshh! how cute in a pathetic KINDA way. and your sorry if she doesnt forgive you awwuh, because im pretty sure by the sound of it all its little and not even close to a big deal  hopee i helped =D!|`|e1F55L7aaa	very cute but i think she is waiting for you to call her.....tell her that you are sorry and ask her to do something|`|9fdba7db8fde332e6c6ebdf101cdf768aa	I would like it and forgive you. Just talk to her and explain why your sorry and promise her a dinner or something|`|rL0k9trPaa	Awwwwwwww yes! I think she should; any guy who went through the trouble to get all that is sure worth it!|`|jvevMDFeaa	that is the cutest way to apologize that I have ever heard. you can teach all the guys out here the right way to do it :)    I think she will really any girl who can pass up a cute gesture like that is crazy. calling might be an ok thing too.. just dont pressure her to tell her she accepts some quiet girls just like to start again like nothing happened.. make her laugh and joke with her.. might help it.. laughter is the best cure :)    good luck|`|PMRY3osxaa	Yeah, I think it's adorable and uber sweet! why don't you give her another day or two, cause It's kinda sounds like you really hurt her, then if she still doesn't call you, send her a couple of her favorite flowers if you know them, if not roses are always pretty, like maybe 3 or 4 flowers and a fake one, and put   "I will love you until the last rose dies" I found it on the internet, then, obviously say Im sorry or something.  Sorry I really get into stuff like this, im a real romantic. Hope she forgives you, which I think she will, she just needs sometime to heal.|`|DyxZSbYnaa	YEA!     How long have you been dating?  If she has a lot of friends and she has a close family, then probably feels secure about herself. So she is not going to respond right away.  Give her time.  She will be watching you and listening to what people say when talking about you.  Just be yourself. Be that same person that you were when you met her|`|klbEjc3naa	yeah thats really cute!!  and thoughful : )  but yeah i agree talk to her face to face as well  good luck!|`|il2cDp0Oaa	I Mean Im not Preppy So This May Or May not Work So You May Not Want To Trust Me But Talk to Her Mabey Give Her A Presant Like you Did..... I Bet She Will Apoligive. Also Ask Her Why She Was Mad|`|5QxIsPBbaa	awwww that is soo adorable! there r not alot of guys that do that anymore.  i think if u see her in the hallway ask her if she got the stuffed animal and ask her for her forgivness.|`|gQKLrKX4aa	yea thats cute but you still need to talk to her face to face and explain what you were going through at the time.    good luck :)|`|3Mi0miV9aa	OOOOOOOOO that was soo cute  it should work  and if doesnt  buy her a suprise gift 4 valentines day  or play her fav song when you walk past her on your phone|`|mArmv987aa	Yes, that was very cute. But it takes guts to apologize in person, face to face (no phones or IM or email, etc.). Cute but maybe she didn't consider it sincere enough? As to whether she will forgive you, it depends how you lost it with her (did you yell at her, or did you hit her, the exact nature of how badly you made her the recipient of your stress will determine if she can ever forgive you).|`|FTZ8kQ9Qaa	you must be a really sweet guy to do something like that...if i were her i would so forgive you...and i get pissed real easy...just ride out the storm:)|`|U4aoxJUJaa	Well , I'm actually sixteen shy and preppy ish as well ,lol. So maybe that can help in some odd perspective. As long as you didn't blame her or say she did something wrong depending on how serious you are there's no reason for her not to forgive you. She may just need some time to think about it . Try communicating with her friends, girls don't hide much from each other and if she sees you're trying or making some effort it should make her smile. I think was pretty cute ,she could also be going through tough times so just wait it out.    Hope I helped (:
yXx1nB0Qaa	The guy is some kind of looser. Why would he ask you to pray for his new baby? He cant seriously consider himself religious can he after having an ongoing affair with you. Just shows what a useless 2 face lying piece of crap he is. Sounds like his feelings are hurt because you refuse to answer him. You know what that means right? You win, now go out and live well, forget about the 2 faced rat bastard.
TXddP0uxaa	This guy is a piece of crap.  He's calling you because he thinks if he sweet talks you long enough, you'll sleep with him.  He doesn't want to get back with you, he wants to have his cake and eat it too.  He's disgusting.  Do yourself a favor and get your number changed.|`|1uRUaSblaa	Looks like he's trying his chances.  Good that  you are refraining from keeping   in touch with him.  He's MARRIED and now, a DAD...  and CHEATING behind his wife's back.  Don't waste time on this man.  There is NO good ending with a man like that.  Move on and keep away from him.  I am sure you will meet someone less complex &   worthier in time to come.:)|`|QC7QgTZ9aa	http://hahaha.ytmnd.com/   come on you know better at your age!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111111111111111...
OdTLUprzaa	Not whenever she wants... If she still lives with you, she lives by your rules. I would let her go maybe for a few hours, but not over night.  Also, what do you know about this guy?  Is he respectable?  (And just so you know, I am 19 and still live at home, by my parent's rules, and I turned out fine)|`|3MGsq3a0aa	i think it would be ok as long as she comes home ever night|`|Hx2raTNQaa	yeah just cuz she cant get off her lazy booty and get a job and cant afford a house dosnet mean u still control her srry if that sounds bad but  yeah hope i helped:))
6L8AFxwdaa	perhaps he misses you? and hes thinking the chinese new year would be a great start to begin something all over again?|`|xM3iQwhaaa	call that number back!    it might be him it might not. just call and say i recieved a phone call from this number.     if it's him you'll recognize the voice.|`|cc09cedaebf78cf81eee61de372a98bdaa	I have an idea. Instead of sitting around and panicking about what he might be thinking or why he hasn't called.. YOU should call HIM :]    I'm sure you'll find out what he is thinking when you two have dinner. So howabout YOU give him a call and set it up.     Good luck :]   and relax. ask him.|`|WANEYn5Xaa	calm down....your totally spazing out so chill!  he probs just needs a friend to talk to or he have feelings for you  just talk to him and see what he wants to talk to you about..dont wait for his call ask him wats up!
BZg5TFlqaa	compliment! even u shouldve known that... silly.  no its  man thing.. their rule is wait to call a girl so she can be all crazy bout him or something. its a stupid rule. i think a guy should wait max. 3 days. otherwise they guy is a waste of my time.|`|sajJeZvgaa	compliment if it was a diss he wouldn't actually plan something with you
TXXNLDVEaa	it's fine to like 2 guys at a time! just don't pursue both, one will end up hurt because he thought you liked him and then you just end up dating the other. just keep spending time with each and get to know them, then make your decision =]|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Well, if you do have feelings for two guys, then you may have a love triangle issue and one of them is going to try to win a heart for you.|`|H7ecdHDyaa	The one you know better is the better choice:)    And yes you can like 2 guys @ the same time, I liked tons when i was young too:P    So if you have feelings reach out for em|`|5UJSX3vJaa	only in Utah can you go 2 guys at a time unless they changed the laws down there|`|MG7CLjtjaa	It happens... but in the end, things just get complicated. It's better to pick one guy.|`|0fabfcfbe06b34a491d903e768e1f239aa	It's really up to you, and how do you know if they into you? and yes you can have feeling for both, but who do you feel more comfort with? who understands you more?|`|WW1xWP8gaa	find out who u have more in common with or who you click with better|`|FhuvmVGPaa	yeah.  Just pick the one you think you like better. or like to spend the most time with.|`|I7eOQ1cpaa	yea but it would be better if they were siamese twins.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	you got to kick it old school and make what we girls call the "Pros & Cons" liist|`|F8Qwlvbjaa	yes i have and you don't have to choose.|`|ZNh9Rr8faa	yes you can|`|alxuJVsCaa	Yes, but it would be better if you pick one.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	if you like the drama that going to happen. you really need to think what you are doing?|`|79eBn6V8aa	go out with both of them...enjoy yourself!!!|`|tzmCxzuKaa	yepp, it didnt end well, wayyy too much drama, so i advise u to pick one|`|AA10395956	Choose the one whoever feels more compassionate to you to date, or get a little more serious. You should really know whoever feels like they care about you more.|`|RBNowXCVaa	yeah, millions of people all around the world face this problem every day.  You just need to make a choice and focus on the one guy.  Don't continue liking them both or else you'll become even more attached and the decision will be ALOT more difficult.  Once you make your choice don't regret it or think of what could of been it's useless stress nobody needs.  Good luck !  (& if I were you I'd choose whichever you know better)|`|KhdkXEPGaa	it is possible to like two @ the same time no need to choose now .u just have more options to choose from & will be able to decide which one meets more of your needs
1NCPPHR9aa	See a shrink.|`|AA10461616	First of all, there's high sex drive and then there's something that has nothing to do with sex but your emotional scars.  That seems to be the case for you since you speak of being molested.  Get help.  I certainly hope it was not when you were 12 and it was your current husband???  At any rate, sex couldn't be that good or fulfilling physically or emotionally if that is all you ever do.  My husband and I have sex less often than many years ago when we married,  but it just gets better over the years.  In fact, the longer it has been, the better it is.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	there are groups and meetings for sex addicts you could find one in your area or neighborhood. and you could also talk to your husband and let him know whats going on and that when you have sex with him it should be about pleasing both of you. try having him go down on you b4 he even gets to c u m. then you can finish it off that way you are getting pleased too.|`|3eede3c6bfcae1014bd3454cd6dac5e1aa	you should talk to your husband about this and then get some treatment|`|ARCURrPhaa	You need help!  Seek counselling for your problems immediately, and bring your husband into it as well and make him understand that he's being selfish in the bedroom. Bottom line is you are screwed up from being molested and you are torturing yourself by replaying it over and over.  How can any man please you in that situation?|`|833d3998e43d4ddd7ca29670d85d6648aa	Troll alert!  Or banjo alert.|`|8WfFuSlQaa	you should get help for it.|`|DCHvyqOGaa	Become a stripper if you have too! You have been married for so long why dont you end it and try to find some one else and date around for a little.|`|3opnkGFDaa	talk it out with him, he'll understand. You need professional help, this isn't just going to go away...
bS3PAySWaa	You did get my attention with the CAPS going on there! LOL!     At the begining of the year, I liked a boy and I went up to him and said "Do you wanna be my BFF?" in  sarcastic way. He said "sure" and looked at me weirdly, but then after awhile he started talking to me more because I am VERY random and VERY funny (My friends think so) and soo, I usually stand out and dress funky to getting people attention. Anyways, after we started talking in school, we started hanging out after school. It was close to Halloween and we ended up going together and right now, we are BFFS even though I still sorta like him.    Pretty much just say "Hi, my friend knows you" or something, or drop something in front of him to see if he reacts. Just make an excuse or just flat out say "hi" and say "Whats up?" then if you keep it up everyday, you two might be more.    BEST OF WISHES TO YOU!|`|B56wTXSGaa	sigh.....just talk to him, seriously. who cares?
3y0w1qIBaa	Talk to his parents about this.  He may be mad at you at first, but you should be glad because you are teaching him to respect the females when it comes to relationship when he gets older.|`|FhuvmVGPaa	hahah that happened with both of my best friends little brohters.. but..except.. they didn't grab my butt.. they just liked me.     .invite your friend over to your house.and dont go over there.....with the weird kid..|`|Tp4jFDWdaa	Tell the mom or have your friend start coming to your house. That kid has issues that need to be fixed. If it's too uncomfortable for you, have your friend tell her mom about her brother's behavior.   I can't tell you how many little brothers have had crushes on me. They'd do the same things.|`|BY6OSDSeaa	ew.. just avoid him when your at your friends house, go to her room and lock the door. and when he does something just tell him to stop, hes a little kid, he'll eventually grow out of it anyway so you wont have to wait long
JqIhy7Pvaa	tell ur friend or her mom what is going on besides he is eight just give him a mean evil look besides why would you have to stand being bugged by an eight year old.
3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	I might answer you... if you ever went in and chose a best answer. I just scanned a bunch of your old questions, and it seems ppl take a lot of time to answer your immature questions, but then you never take the time and vote for a best answer so ppl can get 10 points. Almost all your resolved questions were chosen by voters.... It's kinda rude, just saying.|`|NRWR0POFaa	There's about 3 billion other guys out there.|`|0435c3993c3b05aec46c72cda7b5faa0aa	well i think you need to examine your attitude. what if you were in his shoes and just had a guy friend that you liked to talk to but were completly in LOVE with your boyfriend. you would think he is being an immature snob for wanting your boyfriend to dump you,    you are doing the exact same thing. find another guy and dstop being so cocky!|`|shI5QTKcaa	O no you didn't   who the helllz do you think you are that is completely wrong you should never break up a couple because your to gross to get some..   get over it!!!!     Rick James!|`|XsYrhdY2aa	Don't talk bad about her in front of him.  He obviously likes her and if you say anything bad then it will be offensive to him.  They're not gonna go out forever (the average high school relationship is 3 months long) so just be there for him right now and wait.  Your turn will come, I hope this could help.  Good Luck!|`|tO8ey3o8aa	lmao at roxy!!  and u jus gotta wait it out   dont break them up
KAiHiHkGaa	You think that's depressing?  Oh man, you're in for a treat.  It only gets worse.|`|x4NfpFItaa	You are crushing over some cause you like his eyes? Um.. why dont you talk to him and see what he really like|`|IN1X1CVGaa	omg i know!  it gets better tho :D    ps. maybe you should go for a single hottie  that likes you and will date you!|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	I might answer you... if you ever went in and chose a best answer. I just scanned a bunch of your old questions, and it seems ppl take a lot of time to answer your immature questions, but then you never take the time and vote for a best answer so ppl can get 10 points. Almost all your resolved questions were chosen by voters.... It's kinda rude, just saying.|`|WANEYn5Xaa	haha trust me life isnt just complicated for you i hve the same issues you do  i'm crushing on like the school hottie (well that what mea nd my friends think)  and like he doesnt notice but watever everyone finds their soul mate sooner or later....even though us girls prefer sooner :)  good luck with ur life|`|dzROtYVxaa	been there! somtimes just because he is the hottest guy in school with that pretty buy annoying g/f doesnt mean he is perfect trust me from experience.. alot of them turn out to be jerks!    |`|3kNeWYvdaa	I know people like that this guy I know is exactly like that and I enjoy talking with him and stuff but he has a best girlfriend(gal friend) and she pisses me off! An awesome dude like this best friends with that!:(|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Not that you will LISTEN...  But teen girls need to focus on grades.  Everything else is stupid.
lNlL0Ag2aa	I didn't go to mine also, I remember having taking a huge test before that and I just got tired and walked home. I respect your choice but all that matters is that you won't regret it.     By looking at your details, it looks like you will regret it if you don't go, I just purely didn't care about the prom nor did I even know the time it started.|`|W2RaqfWOaa	I didnt care to go and ended up going. It was a waste of money and I did have a date.  Too much time and stress, too much money and toooooo many pictures|`|JbdNFTj0aa	Dude, I didn't go to prom. It's gay.
qfmTWB9Saa	You're a whore.   I'm sure your parents are proud.|`|qvOEZLJCaa	what the heck forget it girl!!!|`|rVRcMakVaa	****! Thats horrible!!!|`|f23123a78f85512dc7f0c828923d32b0aa	well it was heartless to do something like that. your bf doesnt deserve to be hurt like this. you should be ashamed :(|`|mVUF1zUpaa	no, you shouldn't stay w/ someone you no longer care about.|`|YpP2QFt4aa	that sounds like a personal problem to me.|`|c8WPYjU3aa	WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO??????  BREAK UP THEIR FAMILY???  YOUR BF DOESN'T DESERVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AND YES YOUR A COLD HEARTLESS ***** AND YOUR BEING A WHORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|swOkwZNhaa	wow i hope youre proud of yourself!|`|Mn97YDIyaa	Whore.|`|rAkWoweOaa	What a NICE way to break up a family!|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	Whoaaaa! That's taking it a bit too far girl! Even if you have a thing for his brother, don't dump your boyfriend for his family. First of all, that's very heartless of his brother in the first place to take his own FAMILY's girlfriend. That is low. I wouldn't want to date the kind of guy who would do that. If he would betray his own flesh and blood, what makes you think he won't betray you the same way? I would break up with your boyfriend, because treating him like that is definately not fair, and try to stay away from the both of them.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	You are only with his brother for sex its not love. ITS LUST!|`|dSpLfZFnaa	Maybe you could have a threesome unless there is another brother????|`|z8WIAhDVaa	WHAT?!?!?!?!  Don't go out with his brother!!!!!!|`|TZO9eZfHaa	harsh|`|844DGAMmaa	Jerry Springer is going to have fun with this one.|`|6boH5X5Baa	how could you do that and still think its okay  in my opinion ur a ****  u get with ur boyfriend for his brother  thats sick|`|xyEJKLzZaa	one word.  Pethetic|`|8iAgVLohaa	you ******* **** i hope you get what you have coming to you you piece of ****|`|9WHtStZNaa	Well, considering that you've already cheated on him with his brother, it's already pretty heartless! Is his brother interested in being in a relationship with you? Probably not, because you're going to screw with that family horribly!!!!! You know what I don't care if I get a best answer:    The most low down thing a person can do is cheat, and doing it with someone's sibling adds insult to injury. You should be ashamed of yourself!!! He should dump your *** and then kick his brother in the face. What the hell were you thinking?! CHEATING IS NEVER OKAY!!!!!!!     So I think it's funny that you're worried about being too heartless because let's get the facts straight: You are cheating on your bf with his brother and intend to leave him for his brother, correct?    Yes, it is incredibly heartless, the whole situation is heartless. Yes, by all means, leave him. Chop him up into little pieces, burn him, and piss on his ashes!    How would you feel if a guy cheated on you with a hypothetical sister? Why the hell would you do that to someone else?!|`|mOxVL0luaa	u trying to break up their brother to brother relationship? seriously trust me, don't do it. i am preety relax now so don't make me burn u!! |`|AA10669025	The odds are against your situation ending well.    Why would you start a relationship with your boyfriend's brother?      Why would you betray your boyfriend and why is he betraying his brother?      You say you think you have fallen in love with your boyfriend's brother not that you are in love with him.  Has he informed you that he is in love with you?    How would you feel if your boyfriend started a relationship with your sister and then decided he was possibly in love with her but continued the relationship with you?  Would you think that he was heartless?    No matter what the relationship between the brothers is probably going to be damaged if not destroyed.  Your relationship with your boyfriend has already been damaged and possibly destroyed.  If you continue the relationship with his brother do you see yourself being accepted by his family or friends.  Or is it more likely to cause tensions and anger with his family and friends?    Even if you end it now the betrayal has happened and the damage is done.    When you think of your situation do you feel that you are being heartless?
UezXqDF6aa	go to the police or the board and have it stoppedd. I am a rapvictimm myself. Tell the police because it could get really bad really quickly. You could get hurt or rapped or worse. you telling someone could prevent someone else getting hurt or in that situation.|`|hq13uh9Qaa	You should talk to someone at the guidance office (or someone higher up in the system) about this. What she doing is inappropriate!
qCU2mJ2Caa	OMG! thats gross! ask the head teacher of the school if you can change history classes for wat reasons and if that dosent work just when that happens again tell her off in front of her face tell her you really dont like it and dont appreciate it when she touchs you like that.|`|dkoGI9nfaa	This is called sexual harassment.  If it does not stop he must report the matter.  If he is unwilling to do that you are basically saying to her that it is OK to do it.  It wont go away by itself if you don't do something about it.|`|jhuAlu7Faa	tell that ***** to back off!!! report her and get her *** out of there! no one deserves to be touched like that. she must be a nasty pervert

I love it when a guy compliments me. I don't know if it would just be weird or gay for guys to do it but for girls its just normal.|`|xvXoWX86aa	tell them you do not appreciate their remarks or just ignore them. Sexual harassment lawsuit, maybe? lol|`|Y6IuB97haa	Well, if it really bothers you, talk to them about it.  Say you get kind of embarrassed, and thank them for the compliment.      I don't personally become uncomfortable, but I happen to feel like they are lying for some reason.      Or, just own up and say heck yes I have a nice butt! Thanks!|`|RaqmXLbhaa	I think I would feel weird if people kept comlimenting my butt too...I mean as nice as it is to get a compliment I never really think a whole lot about my butt.   I think the easiest way to cope with compliments that get you a little embarrased is to simply laugh it off.   laugh when you say thanks...they might even think you are being sarcastic and feel embarrased themselves.   otherwise start saying complimenting some random thing back I'm sure they will be stumped.|`|Azj1nMZVaa	sometimes depending on what they are saying|`|GfM4EPwzaa	Yeah,  well depends if that person is around my age or not.  but I joke around with friends like that.|`|QsoY8trZaa	How about say, "Thank you".|`|F4NzbOziaa	lol you should be flattered! i love compliments|`|1HWC5uEDaa	well if you would be gay you wouldnt mind their comments and actually move on with it but well since you say you turn red and stuff u might just not b fully gay..|`|ZqhaMRFqaa	hehe sorry   well just  smile  hey it most be good to look at|`|kccXcgVaaa	Lol, Maybe your super hott.[:    Wear looser jeanss.    [:|`|lX52IMfFaa	I enjoy people touching my butt, often, daily, etc etc etc|`|aMlWMkO5aa	Depends on who is giving the compliment. I would feel uncomfortable if it was at work and it happened more than once.|`|79eBn6V8aa	file sexual harassment charges against them and get them all fired!!!...lol...no seriously...just ask them to please stop.|`|oZuiq138aa	hmm maybe say some joke to cut them oof or something like that  and just be proud of ur butt i guess  be like : gosh i heard it mane times|`|XIJpOE5Paa	tell them to stop? duh  but if your worried about being to sensative dont be just be like guys i get it my butts big look admire  but dont say anything k?    simple as that :)|`|WW1xWP8gaa	yes when someone compliments me on my butt i get really unconformable  and just ignore them because deep down even though your gay you know they want you and just remember you rock!!|`|jylgnn64aa	it is inappropriate for this subject in the workplace.   Unfortunately It has never happened to me. Although I wish some of the chicks at the office said it....|`|9dL6NCoiaa	are you gay because there is nothing wrong with that but if you are then then are being serious but if your straight then they are messing around   but wait you didn't say what gender complaints your butt   if its girl than its totally different because is true and we like it like big|`|CDQJPqQcaa	Well, sometimes it's possible for you to feel okay. But, it may make you feel uncomfortable when ask me about my butttttt.|`|yo3nk21Faa	I want to see this so-called great butt.....pics???|`|xgAVE31baa	I'm straight soo...ya know, you shouldn't really care. You have a nice butt, then thats a good thing. You say thanks and compliment there shoes. Then go back to work.|`|FahOKDN4aa	yes my two best friends(girls) say tht i have a bigger *** than they do and a girl told me tht my *** sticks out|`|tLZYilZJaa	be a meany to them|`|oWX8TRwcaa	tell them how you really feel.  just leave it at that.   your **** is none of their beezwax.  pip pip cherio!|`|WQ862vpHaa	You can simply tell them you do not feel comfortable and you would appreciate it if the stopped telling you that, some things should not be said especially when it keeps going. I understand you, I love to get compliments on my outfit or on how good of a job I do, but when it comes about more personal stuff, I just want to hear it from my husband. Good luck!|`|VK5woom4aa	I feel uncomfortable when I know they like me and they know I don't like them. I would take it as a compliment and be glad of what you have. Flaunt it.|`|li9WGkzLaa	seriously not trying to anger anyone but if a guy smacks my butt i think it is weird and i just laugh and just go along with it if a woman compliments my butt i usually tell them they have a nice butt to and i usually smack their butt back because usually if someone tells me i have a nice but they smack my butt once again i was not trying to offend you in anyway|`|SbNSPIZtaa	I personally would suggest to take it as you would any other complement i mean lets face it if you have a sexy butt youve got a sexy butt. Next time they say something about it just laugh and dont take it too seriously there probably just jokin around. hope this helps      sincerely,                                 Prudence|`|3TdT5mG2aa	Smile and say "Your booty is great, too!" and see how they react. It is a bit uncomfortable but you have to make light of the situation, even if you are gay.
5vV4TXXqaa	im the same age as you, same problem only my football team has me weight lifting and now i have put on weight that's muscle now, just weight lift|`|mOxVL0luaa	we are same lolz except for the age thingy but i got no worry coz i am flexible ^^ still i got tons of date :P so my advice here is, physical is not a matter on finding a date or not. some girls like her boys to be skinny and besides u got time to grow.|`|d789bc0defab78c82f864f62f2e79afaaa	Hastings,    You are just about to get to the point where you will start changing and growing like CRAZY!  So hang on just a little bit longer.  Living through the teen years is difficult.  Take it easy on yourself and on your friends.      Although it may seem as if everyone else is confident, let me assure you that they ARE NOT!  Whether they are too skinny, too short, too tall, too heavy, have bad skin or braces, everyone is feeling just like you are feeling.      So, be yourself.  Be as kind to others as you would wish them to be to you.  Being a good person is more important than being COOL! or HIP or whatever the current IN word is!  Everyone is attracted to a nice guy, so either wait for the new body that you will be getting in a few months or just go ahead and ask that nice girl out.|`|vpvZ6Dwcaa	no not really...just start working out or something
xHcQSLiVaa	Short hair styled right is extremely attractive.  Any man who bases a relationship on hair length is extremely shallow and not worth a lady's time.|`|b7VjEvyaaa	I wouldn't date a girl that was bald.    Unless she had some sort of chemo for cancer.    I love people for who they are...not who I wish they were.    Keep lovin' 'em like Jesus.|`|cfHzBMlBaa	No I would date her if I was attracted to her.....|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	It always grows back anyway|`|AqHm4IQyaa	I prefer hair that at least hangs below the neck.|`|7a68192d6e605ad9c0d1ad60daa6de4faa	depends on how she looks with short hair|`|Aw1Kd0eRaa	no i go for personality  55%personality  25%brains  20%looks|`|erzCdzbYaa	Wtf, No, why would guys care?    Unless its a buzz cut or something.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	yes    If she is bald, that is too short|`|auRHZadYaa	only if she bald or balding|`|BWgV2xSZaa	No, some girls can pull off the short hair look.|`|bYU77eteaa	as long as your short cut looks good on you...some people can't rock short hair|`|ItleV9qeaa	well it depends if i knew that girl and she just recently cut her hair i wouldn't mind   but if i met her with her hair short id pass
kkIVKvitaa	If you like her then tease her. don't be mean though.  Just pick on her with a smile and tell her your kidding when she says something back.   Girls see a strong difference between flirting-teaseng and just being rude.|`|85fae05ed0345163a7a6718fa1838e2baa	compliment her once in a while|`|AA11806027	today's women are stupid as hell,as you can see.|`|nqmGblKlaa	Just be neutral, it's not hard..
Iw8UYrpVaa	if he's a good guy. and has good parents and was brought up polite respectful and by good parents then you shouldnt have to worry.. as long as he knows the boundaries.    just make sure you dont get into trouble with him.. bc then theyre going to not allow you to be with him atall. and make sure your grades stay up and your getting home ontime and everything.    =)|`|DQeUKMbPaa	introduce them to him (parents have done the dating scene and know the pros and cons and know what to look for) after he leaves ask them about there opinion and see what they think. though he is an adult and will go to jail if you two have sex. and once you say you are together (boyfriend & girlfriend) then that automatically means your going to have sex some time. even to your parents that's what it means. to everyone that's what it means.|`|BL9CQgcAaa	try not to let your parents know, or try telling them when there i a very good mood lol.|`|G7ZDmKleaa	I think it's okay. Just don't try having sex or anything illegal. It's fine for you two to like eachother... just be careful.|`|JJMa25NWaa	Woah, I'm in the same position. Except I'm a freshman who is 14.
eFXD3Qzcaa	She probably likes you.
DUWwcfSIaa	If your really her friend you'll tell someone who she can trust like her sibling or mother who can calmly discuss this issue with her. Also, give the the phone number to the suicide hotline.  Just tell her, NOTHING is worth suicide. Run away, change your life, make new friends, any of that is better that suicide. People seem to forget their options in life|`|At7WLduQaa	you have to tell, that will save her|`|brEa9fFDaa	get her some help   even though you promised you wouldnt tell anybody..you wouldnt be a real friend unless you do!     if she commits sucide then you wont have her anymore     you be sorry you didnt tell because itll be to late!|`|1kawTYFraa	just tell her parents anyway or tell her to go to some SPECIAL CLASSES...|`|357BF35maa	that she has you and whatever the consequence ending her life would not just kill her, but you and the other people that love her. tell her it would just make things worse for the people haveing a tough time like her that either love/like her.|`|v8Shukwbaa	Well it depends on what she's mad/sad/depressed about.   Don't exactly try talking her out of it, just pretty much leave it alone  for now. But keep a close eye as if problems worsen do occur,   talk to her and tell her that your here for her. Tell a adult if need be  because that can become serious. She's probably just saying that.   A lot of teens do, it's just a phase. But try talking to her and   make her feel better and tell her your there for her if she needs to  talk to somebody.     hope this helps;]|`|AA12031840	i've been down that road a long time ago and its not good and it gets u nowhere but i'm thankful 4 god giving me all that i have and thats my family and friends who love and watched ova me that wat u have 2 do be her shoulder 2 cry on and stand by her side show her if she does it the pain it will bring she trusts u show her 2 the right path|`|YBfDYlzeaa	let her know there are alot of people that love her and how hurt everyone would be if she did that let her know that everything happens for a reason and she is strong enough to get threw her problems nothing is worth taking your own life over .time is the healing of all problems. day at a time don't stress the past or the future just live in the moment
BWgV2xSZaa	Not really, its life, you cant control it.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Not at all.  Especially when the girl is pretty to begin with.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	No it doesnt, we all get pimples so we know how it feels.|`|sLmX4H3Caa	I will be honest, it depends on how many. One or two or even three, that's a whatever. Once it gets out of hand, she gets out of mind.|`|WXi033Kxaa	Pimples seem to bother the person WITH the pimples more. lol It's life, and most of us all understand what we're dealing with here.|`|DNeMkckyaa	eh not really|`|GJbziTG2aa	Nope. I am fine with that as long as it's not all over your face and never goes away.     What about girls? Do you like it if a guy has a noticeably pimple on his face? Same thing, it's not all over the face,   Thanks.
x8rYunYeaa	i had an amazing first kiss  i was 14 and so was he  and we went to disneyland and it was pouring down rain but we didnt care  we were super shy and super nervous  and then he just kinda leaned in and did it  i literally felt like time stopped   =]|`|nqmGblKlaa	Haven't had it yet. :)
WW1xWP8gaa	OH MY GOSH  that's horrible   i would tell my sister but if she knows than confront him  PS, im so sorry|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	I don't blame you for being concerned and upset but your sister is 45 years old and even though you might think she is not the sharpest pencil in the box, she is an adult and she needs to make her own decisions about her own life. As for as them getting married on your sons birthday, I think you could ask her to change the date. If she doesn't want to change the date then just tell her that you won't be able to be at her wedding because you are going to be celebrating your sons birthday. You can't spend the rest of your life taking care of your sister when she obviously thinks she is taking care of herself. Take care of your own life and family that's all your responsible for.|`|AA11333907	The only thing I agree with you on is being concerned for your sister. This guy does not sound like good news. Having said that, you are wrong to be offended that he wants to marry her on valentine's day. You happen to celebrate your sons bday on that day but you aren't the one getting married here. Its not your choice.And maybe your son doesn't mind either. It sounds like you are just assuming that she is being forced, if you say that she isn't the sharpest needle in the haystack then she has made decisions like this before. It is not your place to judge, you aren't perfect. Back off and support your sister if she is happy, and if she isn't, help her get away and don't judge
8pKyzuy3aa	The next time he tells you he loves you, make eye contact with him, and ask him if he really does love you. You will be able to tell if he really does love you.   I know what you mean. I have been in a relationship with my bf for 3 years now. I wanted to know if he was falling for me like I was for him. He told me that he loved me during the 2nd week of after we met. It was a shock to me because I didn't expect it to happen so fast.   But maybe your boyfriend really does love you.      Best of luck with you and your bf!!!!|`|H1UzYl8haa	well if you';ve been close friends with him before you 2 dated then there is a possibility that he already had love for you  dating just took it to another level of love  i think that he does especially since you feel that way also  i kno it may feel wierd and always bug you because you want to know if he really means it...i understand that    but have a serious talk about love face to face with him and ask him questions like 'would you take a bullet for me babe..."    if you test him like that then you will know and feel more secure    guud luck sweatie|`|btghmpQhaa	there is a possibility that he can truly love you now
5dc6493b424c85096e22e1614be3c9daaa	I feel you pain, I'm in the same boat :( but i can answer.  1- typically you just have to fight your shyness, remove all that that is hindering you from getting what you want, take a deep breath and proceed. Don't say Hi or what is up or you will just end in ice, instead talk about what happened in class or comment on whatever she is doing, you know make small talk and get to know her. Make the relationship go deeper.  2- ask her out sometime and ask her where she wants to go. if she leaves it up to you, then it is your responsiblity to make that appointment, tell her what is an appropriate time to meet, and call her once to inform her of your date. a good date would be just roaming the downtown and letting the night take you to places (Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist).  3- As for the intimacy, just don't over eggaserate and too aggresive on dates, keep it cool, be yourself and be happy. DON'T overthink things.    Also, you can ask her out for lunch an easy way to get to knowher more|`|sY1itvPkaa	Just talk to girls more and just be yourself. When your that old you don't "ask a girl out" instead you ask her on a date. Say the movies or someplace good to eat. As you get to know her more you'll get more comfortable with her and the romance thing will get easier.|`|TuEG2YG8aa	u can just pashunatlly gripd ur dik then, do fast up & doun,when u knowing dont riquird any girlfrnd...kkkkk....hahahaha|`|oLI2SJ08aa	Asking some random girl can be intimidating. Try to sit next to her one class and talk to her a little (ask about the homework, the professor, maybe comment on her clothing or a book she has, etc). After class, ask her out. Don't be too over the top or you may scare her away. Confidence is key. If you think you'll fail, then you probably will.    If she says yes, then you two go on a date! In college, it can be as simple as going to a campus event together (like a sports game) and maybe some food afterward. If the date goes well, ask her on another one. If it sucks, then don't and look for another girl.    You'll have a vibe of what's acceptable for intimacy once you're with the girl. Don't focus on it too much now or you'll be way too nervous when it actually happens.
PDveNWdQaa	ok look if u really love ur guy out of the era n don't wanna do that 4 him then gently ask ur future boss 2 wait as u have a little confuses personally n that it might take time 2 decide about the both of u cause i truly think he likes likes u, then u gotta talk 2 ur first guy i mean 2 see him. if u found that he really still loves ya then u gotta stay with him n try to get away smoothly as possible from the other guy. be strong n do it as i'm sure the boss guy can wait if he told ya that he's gonna make ya fall in him then he can wait 4 ur decision. good luck n hope u can do it.|`|8iAgVLohaa	he wants to boink you
j4JrpXJFaa	I personally feel like its just a good time to have. right now though? haha no i am not looking forward to valentines day.      but i dont think its a true waste of time    ....      for the most part.|`|c8WPYjU3aa	YES!!!!!!!!|`|shaO0coWaa	No,Valentine's Day means nothing to me because I always end up single by Valentine's day.|`|mOxVL0luaa	yeah its a chance to know whos crushes on u and who is ur partner crush :P|`|844DGAMmaa	Yes.     There is a lot of ******* candy.|`|a5SIZIOZaa	I think it is over glorified, I mean, there is nothing romantic about the day. One should enjoy spending time with their loved ones and such on a everyday basis, not just when the Govn't says to.  A bit of information, I will still end up taking my girlfriend out to a restaurant or something, and the usual V-day stuff... but this year, instead of real flowers, im going to make Duct Tape flowers for her.|`|tmUPlfFMaa	YES  even tho im single, i still love it  many of my guy friends, get me things  its such a cute event!!  lol
MYbRICxqaa	You can't do nothing about it now. If it is meant to be then it will be. Also, don't be devious.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	If you love him you will be happy for him. All you can do is hope the don't last long. But DO NOT TRY TO END IT FOR THEM! Support him!|`|ARCURrPhaa	Do nothing. the brother will probably tell his brother eventually, and if he feels the same he will make it known. If he tells you he just wants to be friends you will have to accept it, no matter how hard it is. if it's meant to be it will be.|`|BL9CQgcAaa	then maybe you could compete with his gf for him, seduce him, fight!|`|tO8ey3o8aa	if u really love him as much as u think u could wait it out  but i would move on|`|aYyRhxA4aa	well u gotta b strong n  patient!!|`|c8N4fS6aaa	Just wait it out|`|XqAWm9Yjaa	try to text or call him or maybe date his brother|`|DUPOEk1daa	You still have to tell him.  But if he doesn't feel the same way, you MUST move on.|`|g3HrRmaCaa	well dont tell him u like him like that. only thing u can do is sit back and wait til he breaks up wit his girl, then u let him know u like him. then see what happens|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	there are a few things to do  -confess  -try not to spend as much time wiith him so you're love will fade for him  -or you maybe confused for real love and a best friend's love---you should look into your heart for that|`|C72xMgl4aa	first off...NOTHING is dumb about this question. it IS really hard to watch the person you would want to spend the rest of your life with with someone else. i would let him know how you feel. you never know, he could feel the same way, and he's just using his current girlfriend to fill the void you leave behind. definitely let him know that you love him. you may be surprised what the outcome may be.   hope this helps. =]|`|0JqhnVV1aa	wait mybe hell see hes true love is right in front of him

LZXax4KUaa	I doubt anyone could tell unless they stare intently into the eyes and see the rims of the lenses O_o|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Guys can't tell that sh*t. Our eyes are usually fixated on your eyes, boobs, or ***. Women check guys out from their teeth their nails, eye lashes every single inch. My friend who is a girl , I thought her eyes where green for like 2 years some days she'd even not wear them I just found out the other day that her eyes are hazel. I personally don't care at all, whatever you want to do to make yourself fell pretty, some guys might care though.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	lol y2j     you deserve best answer

QjgxH7Ouaa	Ok, STOP THE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW.  It's not fair to you, her, her husband or her infant daughter.  Get out now.  I mean NOW.  You're too young to throw your life away and believe me, when her husband finds out, you will probably be doing just that.  I know you're already having feelings for her, but seriously, GET OUT RIGHT NOW.|`|dr9y4tJsaa	AsShOlE!!! her husband is out risking his life everyday for our country and you slept with his wife? how mad would you be if you were him? STOP|`|hDAoKmjPaa	dont do it anymore and stay away from her so you can try to become un-attached.,,,she has a man and you shouldnt be there even tho she wants it. she is just lonely and is just using you till her man comes back. when he does she is not going to want to have anything to do with you.|`|b9791c0d942f7d7caa7f70d6161e349caa	end this now|`|sCGWcJTFaa	Ok maybe you shouldn't have done it in the first place.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	End it NOW !!!

The situation could get really bad..|`|I7eOQ1cpaa	just keep doing it until u get bored n never tell any 1 not even yur friends cos they could get drunk 1 nite spill the beans n the husband might shoot u. oh n try as many position as u can with her if she lets u .|`|TllYHNVRaa	keep doing her. he's off being genocidal, so she's alone and needs someone there. maybe she'll break it off with him...|`|nT5QNGpzaa	It's stuff like this that will get you killed.

DROP DEAD &  GO TA HELL >:)
Lq0wkIffaa	i really like it when girls ask me about my past shenanigans haha.  like when they ask about have i ever got hurt i can tell them a story about my early child hood.  What else.  Um just how are you, then when the guy says good or okay, say really how are you and why.    try and bring up memories mostly i guess, good memories or atleast good stories|`|idrRW9M7aa	If they ask how you are doing and really care and want to know the answer.  That's great.
sICqdaDzaa	He does sound like a jerk, I think he's messing with you.|`|yC7hgBfGaa	you should totally make out with him|`|TXXNLDVEaa	he wants sex and thats it his personality sounds idiotic. if your friends and people who know him tell you not to fall for him then don't, listen to them.|`|aSenTXv6aa	he likes you hehe! you better get ur flirt on!!! cuz hes flirtin with you!|`|yRpS6mNbaa	umm that guy is kinda imature  but considering ya'lls ages i understand  well it seems like you already made up your mind  if you dont care what people think and you like him   let him know  he obviously is intrested in you  just go for it|`|AA10934463	why dont you ask him to eat lunch with you or something make the first movie if you like this guy so much , he does seem like a horney kid with those comments but what highschool kid isnt and he may just  like the saying says "you talk the talk but can you walk the walk"  .I would say pay close attention to what your friends say about this  guy if you think its crazy then dont listen but there  not the ones  that have a crush on him its you and when you have a crush EVERYTHING about that guy is perfect ...buti would get to kno him better other then "sex" and "ill show  you the power point"  see  what hes really thinking and  if its just sex then give him the BOOT ...GOOOD LUCK !|`|HEI2Zx8Haa	he is definitely a player, definitely a big flirt  & definitely messing with you!|`|N0dBxV52aa	well if hes NOT  an asshole he prob just had a bad day  everyone does  and maybe he was acting weird cuz he had no idea how to act around u  u kno?  but just nt put ur heart too far out there unless he does first  cuz then u wont get playd  just safety procautions :)|`|0MkGrploaa	He is probably just a flirt. You need to watch and see if he is like that with others|`|AA10204532	it seems like he is making some moves. it is in that case if you have never really talked before. go for it, but do not assume things too fast, and do not jump into anything. just be his friend first, get to know him, and then see for yourself what is up!   p.s. my friends (boys) told me that they do not like very much when girl pushes them into relationship. so watch out, do not go too fast. ;)  my best wishes.

sICqdaDzaa	It depends on the girl. If she has a lot of guy friends, then no. I have a lot of guy friends and do the stuff on the 6 reasons list, but that doesn't mean I like him. If she doesn't have many guy friends, then she probably does.|`|WHClrBHRaa	Im a girl and i think she likes you. i dont think she would actually just blurt out on the bus who she likes thats very awkward and some guys are immature about that stuff. do you have her   if so text her send her flirty messages every now and then girls like that. Maybe u shuld play truth or dare over text and be like who do u like? and say will u say it if i guess and guess a couple guys then u.     hope this helped good luck!!|`|AA10395956	Well, if she was a little blushy like and acted like she was hiding some feelings, then she may of been lying about the name thing. If she doesn't like you for real, then she doesn't like you.|`|KeT55QP4aa	probably maybe not she might have said no because there was like three other guys there or she just dont want u to know (ps: girls ask to were there guy friends clothes all the time i get asked every day by like a bunch of girls to were my doss high school wrestling hoody
5AJMwpXPaa	compliments!!...call her cute! but dont let to many people hear you cause girls can get nervous and then she think everyone saw her getting nervous and she worries too much....    tell her best friend that you really like her cause then she will tell her .... thats a great way to let her know you like her ....    laugh and smile alot when your around her....    look at her in the eyes.....    ask her for her number and then call her and talk on the phone...  (call her late at night... but not when she would be sleeping...   around 9ish 10ish and just talk on the phone)    text her alot!    when u say hey! to her dont just say hay say hey (enter name here)  so it would be like hey emma or hey gabby!    give her a hug!!!!!!!!!!! girls love hugs!    haha! hope i helped|`|ajK4OLROaa	compliments and be nice about every thing  see if she flirts back|`|da2KJ9fXaa	compliments and a hugs or light touching|`|jnXenqcMaa	They will flirt back if they are interested.|`|TTUdERZEaa	girls like when you flirt with them but dont be too outragious
isPxtl3oaa	if ur in that situation then harsh. if my best friend left i would track her down because i kno there would be no reason above kidnap that she would up and leave me. i wouldnt be pissed i would be worried... one of my friends is planning this... going off n not telling anyone but i found out. i wasnt pissed i was upset. bset friends that do that should have a good reason. just find it out|`|3Kejy6Ldaa	I must imagine shes here  Find a second bestfriend or substitute bestfriend like my friend  dont lose your friend  never say goodbye  chatting or texting  THanks n advance~~~~`|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I would be very offended.|`|AA11437439	i had a friend who just upped and went to california permanently!    i was so upset    then because he didint manage to find a job he was back within 3 months - i didnt hold a party|`|uxrFOOn9aa	you can feel bad if it makes ya feel better , but that wont bring him back. move on your a adult now and i hate to be the barer of bad news, but in this life **** happens and it hurts sometimes. move on and make new friends . sorry for your loss though.
85tAhnM9aa	Play this game called "20." Go ask 20 girls if they would like to go out sometime. Sure, plenty may turn you down but not all of them can. And if that doesn't work just watch Fight Club, that always makes me happy.
mKArP6jKaa	talk to him but just once so he knows ur interested then just wait an see if he pursues you. hopefully he will but if he doesnt u know he could care less.
1947fcb7048f3b1510a09feafb25f08daa	its too bad that you all can't go.. theres a couple different approaches you can take     1. tell kelsie i'm sorry but when you told me you couldn't go i asked someone else.. maybe we could go another time.    2. tell samantha i'm sorry but my plans changed, i forgot that me and another friend had something planned.... what about (bowling, movie, pizza . .  etc) next weekend?    a little white lie may help to spare your friend's feelings|`|gWT53mGJaa	Well thats a tough situation you have to deal with if you already made plans with Kelsie then you should keep those plans with her go and have some fun with Kelsie. :) good luck.
af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Hon, you are not making your wife want you.  Cheating is ******* up, childish, and stupid-- don't do it.    I am 47, and still love to make love...but my hubby of 3 yrs needed much guidance to do the trick.  Seduce your wife...have a romantic candle-lit bedroom witing. Buy her flowers, do a load of laundry.  We have many things that spark us--care enough to find her spark...|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Too long. Cheat already.|`|H2bpuDsKaa	Do what you must.....Just be sure to use a condom....and play it safe every time......|`|sR6vhbataa	You said lack of sex AND affection. If there is a lack of overall affection, then there's something wrong besides just not getting enough sex. Sorry to tell you this, but there *are* other problems in the relationship.     For men, intimacy often comes through sex first, emotions later, for women it tends to be the other way around. Are you interacting with your wife enough? Having fun together? Do you hold her hand, make her feel special, flirt with her? You may feel sexually rejected by her, but are you rejecting her in other seemingly small but signficant ways?|`|agTCqkLDaa	It sounds like you tell her in passing that you will cheat on her.  Sit down with her and explain to her exactly how you feel.  Maybe you all are the type who need an open marriage?  I totally disagree with them, but it works wonders for some people...|`|ZtfN4J6taa	Go out there and find someone who will take care of your needs !|`|dLPONQQVaa	See I dont think it woukl be right for you to cheat on her, coz that would be disrespecting her. Talk to her first and tell her that this may lead you to stray from her. If you really love her , i dont think you would cheat under any circumstance.|`|8WfFuSlQaa	I would talk to her again about it.  You may need to be proactive and maybe see a counselor but make sure it is a good one.  You may also need to bring her into the counseling with you.  Having sex outside of your marriage will not do anything to make things better between you and your wife.  Work on what you can and really let her know how you feel.  Also, put the shoe on the other foot.  Would you want her cheating on you and lieing to you about who she's been with.  Wouldn't that hurt you, and think about the betrayel.  If she was in your place wouldn't you rather her be blunt about it with you and get it out in the open so the two of you work towards a solution?|`|QClFoSNhaa	you need to sit down and tell her that you love her and dont want to leave but you have need that need to be filled as women do too so she should understand tell her exactly hoe you feel. I would never tell you to cheat because it hurts everyone involved. If you can take a weekemd together and try to reunite. Sometimes a simple I love you and a kiss out of the blue makes a world of difference.|`|CBZQqCRlaa	You need to ask her what she want's and I am not talking sexual.  Yes, sex is important to us guys.  We can perform almost on demand but for women it is different.  If she is thinking that you are too controlling or opinionated then it might not be her.  It might be you.  You said that she passes tests that you give her.  Sounds like you do not trust her anyway. What if she gave you the same tests, how would you feel?  If you do care and love her as much as you say then treat her as your wife and not as a piece of property.  Maybe she is filling a void by letting you have an affair so it will be easier to distance herself both physically and emotionally from you.  Cheating is cheating no matter how you rap it.  You have opened a pandora's box that can not be closed until you decide what you are going to do.  You need to stop the affair before you lose your wife.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Cheating is cheating is cheating. How do you think SHE will feel if you have an affair? I cannot give you permission to cheat on your wife.    There are reasons she may not enjoy sex that have nothing to do with your manhood. She should be checked out by a doctor to find out why she is no longer interested in sex. It may be hormonal, or something else going on in her body that is causing it.     Did something happen that caused her to feel differently about you? Have you considered marriage counseling?     It isn't fair for one spouse to withhold sex in the marriage, and I can understand your frustration and desperation. But I would advise you to exhaust all other options before turning to another woman to satisfy your needs.
OVUkamlpaa	Your dope smoking is making you paranoid|`|QVsTGbxeaa	Im shy too, and I have found that the best way to meet people is to get involved in something I have an interest in, and network from there. Join some kind of group or volunteer or spend time in a place that pertains to your personal interests.  Going out to a bar and just being social can be fun, but there is such a variety of people there that it is hard to filter out who will actually be worth the time, and who is just trying to get attention. When you do meet someone, ask them what they do and where they go for fun, and maybe you will get an invite. Let them know that you are new in town and maybe you will be able to meet their friends. Eventually your contact list will grow. But do not be impatient because then you end up talking to whoever the first person to talk back, and miss out on meeting people you have more in common with. Good Luck.|`|005b9d937f89063d9351dfdb68b24f2faa	Do you have any hobbies/intersts?  That's probably the easiest way I know to meet people.  When you find a group based on your interests it's easier to find things to talk about with new people.  I'm not really comfortable around people but I've found that when I get involved in groups based on my interests it's a little easier to talk to people.    Check you local parks and rec dept. and see what rec sports they have for people in your age group (just guessing but I'm guessing you're around 25-30).  Try talking to your co-workers and see if any of them have similar interests.  Sometimes just getting to know a couple people helps you meet others.  Good luck
5bd7f95e4cefe3e42325c3f612f46d35aa	In this crazy and chaotic world we live in, it is easy to destroy the trust of a friend with out really meaning to. There are far less ways to mend a friendship then there are to damage it. Yet over time a true friend will forgive you, while a string friend will most likely will switch from being your friend to being a foe.    You might be wondering about the difference between a true friend and a string friend.     Well a String friend is the kind of friend that basically will pal around with you, hang out and joke and get into mischief with you however when something bad happens they vanish and leave you to fend for yourself. It dosen't matter what age you are or race or ethnicity, every one comes across this kind of friend at least once in their life.    Then there is a True Friend this kind of friend you wish everyone was, these friends are usually comrades youv'e known for a long time and they're always around when you need them, they help when you need it and they always take your feelings into consideration before doing anything and vice versa. Don't confuse a true friend with a best friend. I'll explain my idea of a best friend a little later.    A Best friend is absolutlely the ultimate kind comrade because they are there for you no matter what. You can cry on each others shoulders and embrace each other. The Bond you share with your best friend is special and never be broken. So I believe in keeping all friends close but to watch the String kind.    This my own philosphy on friendship feel free to comment or email me just don't be too harsh          most welcome|`|EPBqSSvDaa	I think that there should be no diff btw Trure Friend and Bst friend.  A frieind said to be true if it was ur best friend, without be a best fnd a fnd nevr be a true fnd.    the person to whom you share ur secrets, sorrows, is ur best friend, and the person who keeps these secrets with him and give hope & strength in ur sorrwness is true friend.......|`|07fhLLr8aa	well a best friend is someone that you tell some secrets to. and that when you need a hug they will give it to you.  but a true friend is always there no matter what. for example if u were being really mean. they would still be their. and if you are crying then they help you and hug u and kick the persons *** that hurt you.lol   best friends are just people your really close with. but a true friend is like your spirit sister or brother.  i hope i sort of helped.|`|TZCzjpGmaa	true friends, understand your problems and help you resolving your problems...    best friend, takes your problems, makes you feel that you never had a problem, resolves your problems like his own...|`|lBZl0kAXaa	a true friend is one who is always there beside you when you need him/her    a best friend is some one with whom you can share your every secret and you can trust him/her.your best friend is also your true friend    a best friend is a true friend...but all the true friends are not best friend....|`|GckVXU4Paa	True friend will understand u, will stand for u, will help u.    Best friend will have all the characteristics of a true friend, and u can share ur secrets with a best friend.     A true friend will help u, whereas a best friend will even help u move a body.|`|aVvLmizqaa	Universe,  Earth,  World,  Peoples,  Life,  Relations,  True Friend,  Best Friend|`|OFhCTA6Oaa	Best friend : Someone whom you can share everything, someone who understands you, someone who is there for you, and they expect the same from you too.....  If the expections are not met, you may loose them...    True friend: have usually all qualities of best friend, there are there no matter what. There is a space for expectations, but they are still there even when you cant keep in touch with them.If you come and look for them after years, they will be there for you....
AA10542611	yeahhh!!    most of the times, a girl tells her friends lol  its just what we do :))|`|TX0LiKBraa	Yeppp... They know.  No chance in heck they don't.|`|0505728aabf6d1f12318dd2e4d00717aaa	Well girls don't usually know when someone likes them.  Like, we get a bunch of self doubt and stuff and don't believe it.  But if we think he likes us and we like him then we tell our friends :) all of them!|`|mtIEsgzfaa	yes, but you can tell from their response towards you if she likes you back|`|ySvWezDdaa	she may have, or it may just all be in your mind that they're looking at you funny if you're paranoid about it.  also, maybe she didn't tell them anything but they figured it out on their own, a rumor, etc.  either way, it's really not a big deal.  how old are you?  it really doesn't matter what they think.   but to answer your question, sometimes girls tell their friends, but less so when they mature...sometimes it's not always benificial to tell the whole world about your personal business, yes?  again, it depends on the girl.|`|ddWyRjmVaa	They usually do tell their friends. 80% of the time.  I don't cause even though i have alot of friends, im paranoid and i dont trust any of them, im afraid their going to use it against me..
XdqU4Rzhaa	Yes... Just like guys tell their homies when they've smashed a girl, we tend to tell our girls that we like a guy... But not in too much detail like guys tell. But definetely that's a YES!!!!!
b6ccac7a047169fde765030620090cc2aa	if i were you i would chose a friend over someone you like ..friends r always going to be there how long do u think hell be there 4 u...you guys should make a deal not to jeopardize you friendship like guys say bros b4 hoes ...i guess it can be the same 4 girls...theres plenty of more fish in the sea...well good luck =)
sebhK7r7aa	Imagine the guy you want to talk to is a girl. A little weird at first, but works if you get used to it.|`|qIziYpVAaa	I just dont think about it. I say anything. After all they are humans you know...They would like you better for being yourself. Let them like you for who you are,than liking you for something that you're not.|`|bfxdJddlaa	hmmm... I don't think you stand a chance.  You're not a very nice person.  Maybe your dog might let you fool around with him....  =]  that's all.
Ce0FQO4daa	hi! you answered my question. ok your problem is tough...but I would still stick to my bf. that guy might not like you and you know if your bf asked you out he likes you! Hope I helped, plz pick me!!! I picked you for best answer!!|`|wY8V2Rtcaa	well you have to think is it worth giving up your bf for a guy that may like you.
FdY5qFE7aa	Different for everyone  If you love her you would be the one to think she is perfect in every way|`|SohrsIBoaa	1 every guy who says he doesnt care what a girl looks like is full of crap. dont forget that. my perfect girl would be....brunette. blue eyes. nice round booty. 36d. i like curves. i LOVE hips. BUTTT she has to be very well educated, college level brain. willing to fight for what she loves, even if shes fighting with me. amazing sense of humor. and she needs to really mean it when she says she loves you. i feel really stupid for answering this question. kinda freaky.. my perfect girl is my girlfriend.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	no preference in hair or eye color but she has to be cute enough to attract me.  athletic body, toned and defined but still very feminine  measurements proportioned to her frame and 100% real.  She can't be a liberal or like the Jonas bros or Hanna Montana haha  good sense of humor, genuine confidence, educated, ambitious, fun outgoing, loyal, dedicated, has her own views and can think for herself.  She has to love the beach and outdoor life and be spontaneous  non-smoker and drinks very little.      Please forward this to Santa Claus, thanks.|`|auLIuEA3aa	Nice and Pretty. lol  I must admit I am a little shallow lol.  I have a thing for brown hair and green eyes too.|`|ZRqSpl1Aaa	Not a party animal or airhead. Likes to read, learn new things. I like creative girls (ie, painter, poet, fashion, singer, etc). Must be comfortable in her skin. Naturally beautiful, doesn't cake on the makeup. Kind and gentle. Big fan of music. Passionate. That's my perfect girl.|`|GQ8aKXr6aa	If I said you would you be happy?    Well... I'm gonna go ahead and say you anyways|`|Eo4P2s3yaa	There is no such thing as a perfect person. People who look for perfection in human beings are living in lala land and are setting themselves up for pain.    But on a lighter note...   Every guy is attracted to different qualities in women, but all guys like: clean, smart, funny and not-psycho.    Things not to do: giggling and laughing at stupid things. This is what airheads do. If you're this kind of girl, then we just want to f you.  If you have a level head and are sure about yourself, then we want to talk to you and get to know you.    You'll know a guy is genuinely interested in you if asks questions about you. Give him the short answer (you know what I mean, you don't have to include every detail)|`|savPsYWjaa	A Giant Vagina on legs.|`|sebhK7r7aa	Brunette, Modest, Loves Music, and most important to me.

Beautiful face is often better than a great body cause you won't get to see the latter all that often...maybe.    Nice, but not too nice. Can take a joke, can tell a joke. Laid-back, but when work needs to be done....  Only really serious if the need arises for seriousness, NOT whorey (is that a word...) Not too shy but not extrememly outgoing. And one of the most important things, comfortable to be around after I get to know her.    I like her already :)    oh yea, like the same kinda music as me, or something close, and if absolutely necessary as long as the music she likes isn't downright annoying...|`|08f801cb12076679501327c507f16f44aa	The perfect girl is the same as the perfect guy. It has nothing to do with hair or eye color, it doesn't matter if they have a nice butt or big boobs, all that stuff is just icing on the cake.     If they are the right one for you, he or she will be in your thoughts every hour of every day. You will hate to be away from them, you will long for their touch. And the feeling will go both ways. Meaning you will feel the same about each other. It can't be a 70-30 relationship, it must be 50-50.    I met a woman 2 yrs ago, and for the first time in my life, I feel that I'm in love. She's attractive, but not stunningly beautiful. But I enjoy her company like no other. And I hate being more than arms reach from her. She's the first thought in my mind when I wake, and the last before I sleep.     For years I used to hear people say that they were with their best friend. Every time I heard that, I thought "Really? Hmm, I don't have that". I realized the woman I had been with for 26 years, was the wrong person for me. Don't get me wrong, I loved her, but she never felt like my best friend.    But the woman I'm with now does, I love her so much, I can feel my heart swell. It actually feels like I can feel love pouring from my heart towards her.    Remember this if nothing else...    Love is supposed to feel good, if it doesn't, then you're in the wrong relationship.|`|OI29tkSoaa	she would be you :-]|`|cEAtQVJyaa	funny, loyal, sexy,|`|PE7OS0f6aa	taLL, long arms, strong, able to fight.

hU7faDq5aa	That's normal.    In fact, I'm in the same thing. I think you should just go for it and trust that it won't happen. What's life if we can't learn to let go of the past in order to search for something new? When my bf cam along he was too good to be true, which scared me. I thought he was acting like the perfect guy just to get in my pants. I'd been hurt, used, you name it. I was and sometimes still wonder, what if he'll hurt me, or something? but so far, I'm so glad I took the plunge. Just do it, let go, be happy :) I know I am, and you can be too.    Hope this helped|`|a0b40c7a80dd3de9085039f8daf76ec6aa	This is completly normal. Anyone in the begining can and will feel doubtful, as you do, strange, wrong, you name it.    Your fiend is right, you should just go along with this relationship and any other you are going to have.  You can always recover, but you can never go back to experience what you have missed.  Get the best out of every new thing, new begining, new everything. Learn and Enjoy.|`|Ga9oCLavaa	I would not want to go to college being "IN a relationship";    You should focus on your studies and meeting lots of new people and not having to worry about a relationship.     Stay single and enjoy life; you'll meet hundreds of new people in college...so don't get tied to one.|`|Anzu2Nr4aa	Just go for it. I've been in relationships i've doubted before. definitely did not work for me.   just GO FOR IT.|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	Yes it is good to have a man in our life.   It is normal to have doubt in the beginning.  It is good to go slow.  But  You are young and pursuing your study.  It means you must have set a goal in your life.  Put your priority straight.   Which come first?   From the way you wrote I can feel you are very matured enough,  so go ahead and take the plunge.  You know what you are doing!|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	All new relationships are a bit scary at first especially if you have been hurt before. The best thing to do is take it slow and analyze what happens at first. Is he honest and does what he tell you check out? Does he keep his word? Is he open about things such as his family and his job? Does he make you feel good about yourself and secure in your relationship? When doubts start to creep in talk to him and work them out. Be honest with him from the start and tell him it will take you a while to trust him. If you likes you enough he will wait until you are secure and happy before moving on to the next step. Just go slowly at first...a few dates...then see how you feel. Just because you go to that college doesn't mean you have to be with him either so don't fret about it if it doesn't work out but be happy if it does. You have to dip your toe in the water eventually or you will never learn to swim. Just go slowly and take your time and don't be bullied into anything.|`|nnYoYRWiaa	i can't help i wish i could
VZN3rT9Waa	I would say it happens in an instant, because all it takes to "fall out of love" is to realize that you don't really love someone. As soon as you come to that realization, that's it.  You might start to notice all their faults over time, but it's only that one thought that counts.  But don't worry, it's a learning experience. How else would you know what's best ? It's all trial and error, but only some people are lucky enough to find the right person quickly.|`|MDsUNZIHaa	in an instance, i guess...    honestly, i don't have any idea... since i've never been in love... i've never been out of love too, obviously...    haha...|`|kkIVKvitaa	I think it just happens over time.|`|oNhIoVLIaa	For me, it took awhile. It was in stages, but eventually I fell out of love with the guy :)|`|C72xMgl4aa	over time, but, its sudden when you realize you don't love the person you're with.|`|H9deeyqgaa	happens over time... one day you can't live without him and six months later looking at his dumb face or his annoying voice makes you want to scream..... it's crazy|`|9LLKBKOmaa	comes in an instance but you realize in stages as it is typically difficult for humans let go of comfort and what they know and trusted for a while.|`|BRYkcp62aa	I believe in stages. But everyone is different. I would take a look at the person you are with an think bout how you feelwen u r round that person. Like does it jus feel like lost or is there still a flame.|`|el8yX5q3aa	usually stages....|`|47R03TbFaa	IT TAKES TIME TO FALL OUT OF LOVE BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T WAKE UP AND DECIDE THAT TODAY YOU NO LONGER LOVE THIS PERSON ESPECIALLY AFTER BEING WITH THIS PERSON FOR SOOOO MANY YEARS IT HAS TO DO WITH A LOT OF THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE AND WHAT LEADS TO IT OVER TIME|`|4RsCjHxXaa	It's kind of gradual.  At least for me.|`|mLUm0tllaa	Yea, just happens gradually, you'll still love the person but not like you use to...|`|RvmYqQtRaa	That depends I gradually lost interest because my partner abused me until I gave up on trying to make her happy. But I still remember the exact moment the relationship snapped. My advice save time if you try to save a relationship more than twice and the other party just doesn't care let them go.|`|010c55146a7a1aa4e904234657093e98aa	it will come for an instance.. one day you will wake up realizing you fall out of love...      that's all thank you!! c^^,)|`|R4wEzQZ2aa	stages  because i really love or like the person   but then i gradually dont feel that way anymore|`|CIwBOKCWaa	My came from stages.  He just became so dumb and uncaring,  I just forgot about him and moved on.|`|XbsuY1ogaa	It could hit you like a brick to the head where you think 'Wow, he's really not right for me at all', but I think usually it happens over time.|`|T4tM4NWKaa	it depends who the person is. if they are mean they just drop out of the relationship and if they are nice they lead u out in stages so they dont seem like the bad guy|`|6y94LMmqaa	I believe definately in stages. Like falling in love. The closer you become the deeper you fall in and out of love. However I think that if it is real love it doesnt always subside|`|9975c9f1d681062aa347b0fdca75cfa1aa	if ever you fall out of love  then you never fell in love in the first place
gP11453Waa	I agree with David's answer, but I might add something, too.       You promised the truth, so that would be the way to go.  However, you can just tell your friend that you have said some unfavorable things about her family but that you are truly sorry.  Acknowledge that it was a mistake and promise not to do it again--a real promise that you will keep.  Maybe you could even suggest getting to know each other's families better (though you do sound a bit judgmental--maybe you could work on that), and that might be a good thing, for your perceptions could be off base.             You might not be seeing the full value and character of her family.  Remember, she is part of her family.  Is she really your FRIEND?  Are you really HER FRIEND?   Also, do you think maybe she already knows some of the things you have said?             One more question:  How do you ACCIDENTALLY say something about someone in her family?                    Anyway, decide how much your friendship is worth.  If it's a thing to keep, then do the wise things.  Do the right things.  BE A FRIEND.|`|aRIA86D8aa	It's times like these we make the decision to be honest and base our lives and relationships on honesty or on what our friends and family want to hear. What kind of life do you want? What kind of relationships do you want? If you want shallow relationships - tell her what she wants to hear. If you want meaningful relationships - tell her the truth as you said you would and expect the same from her.    Relationships are meant to be worked through - forgiveness and thoughtfulness. You have friends because you find in them something valuable. If you can't trust what your friends say, why trust them at all?|`|3opnkGFDaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...  BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD IDEA! VERY VERY BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD! people only want to hear what they want to hear :( if you tell her i guarantee you that your relationship will fall to pieces :(|`|IigNmZxZaa	Telling her the truth might hurt her, so you might not want to tell her unless you would like her to get mad at you. Most people want sympathy, not the truth. Just don't for now.

He can give you tips himself and that's what stimulates good kisses. I had the same problem when I was seventeen.|`|rjou1CGhaa	You don't need "tips"; you need honesty.  Every person has a unique pair of lips, and every couple will have a unique way of kissing.  Trying to fit a standard operating procedure of kissing onto such a unique experience just doesn't work.  Some of the few commonalities are to relax, take your time, and go slowly, so you can figure out what feels good, together.    If your guy is such a Prince Charming, he will be understanding, probably be pleased that you haven't kissed anyone else, and be more than happy to give you a guided tour.  Tell him the truth, relax and enjoy.|`|8iT9DcNcaa	hey just be open and honest with him and the rest will fall in..|`|dJkNofnoaa	haha kiki your answers is the best   and completely correct|`|pQBjqMkoaa	get ready for a buttload of "it comes naturally"|`|bxqwIjyeaa	so it happens that i am the master of making out. you are in luck. but in order for the first answerers prophecy to come true. i have to tell you 'it comes naturally.' i'm sorry the first answerer had to ruin it for you.    but to answer your question. it comes naturally|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	Step1  Get a piece of fruit and find some privacy. Pick a fruit you are particularly fond of, as it will be the object of your affection during your kissing training. An orange or apple will work just fine.   Step2  Hold the fruit lovingly in your hand and practice gently kissing it. It helps if you close your eyes and picture your true love. The kiss length should be approximately 1 - 2 seconds.   Step3  Examine the fruit...Is there a lot of saliva on the fruit? That could indicate you are a "sloppy kisser." Is the fruit bruised or the skin pierced? That would mean you went in too strong or used too much force. Remember, kissing takes practice, don't get frustrated if you can't get it just right the first time.   Step4  Wipe the saliva off the fruit, and try again until you feel comfortable with the kissing motion, duration of kiss and pressure. Make sure there are no jerky movements, quivering or shaking. Once you are confident that this first kiss will not end in total disaster, move onto the next step.   Step5  Destroy the evidence, eat the orange / apple you've been practicing with.   Step6  Now for the moment you've been waiting for. Your first kiss! This article is not meant to teach how to get someone to kiss you, only to give you confidence in your first kiss.    Remember to strike when the iron is hot and amaze your partner with an "experienced" first kiss.|`|rHTsKg3kaa	guys are weeird

4qL7oRrVaa	I'll be honest, but probably not.    I can tell you that from the multitude of experience I have had meeting people off the internet, that you really can't trust anyone until you build a history with them.    People have a strange idea of what is going to happen on these meet ups, you want to lay out the rules before you even meet (no hugging, no dark places, etc)    If you end up meeting him there are rules you should instill for it, and strongly abide by;     TELL someone where you are going and who the guy is.    See him on his webcam, if he doesn't have one, no go!    Meet in a public place, a coffee shop, the mall, perhaps bring a friend with you, just as long as there are LOTS of people where ever your meeting.    Do not bring him to your home, do not go to his home. Do not get into any cars. Do not offer your last name. Do not offer your home address.    Even after the day is done, and it went well, do NOT give him your phone number, he can contact you via the internet.    If all goes well, keep these rules in place until you build a 'history' with him - you've met some of his friends, his parents, perhaps he's met your parents, he's never tried to pressure you to do anything you don't want to, you have a very solid idea of who he is.    In the end.. don't trust him yet, if he talks to you and is still the same and doesn't give you the creeps for at least 6 months, then maybe, but he might bugger off before then.|`|NTUr0t3haa	No, you can't trust him. That is equivalent to trusting some guy you met on the bus.|`|1H56FPt8aa	Where does he even live? If he is close & you want a relationship sure. If he lives far whats the point...wouldn't you rather find a nice guy near you to date?    Sounds like you are being careful.

Do not give any personal info! ITS DANGEROUS!!!!|`|ToQEyzXHaa	Not at all.  You may not have heard but somebody killed there selves like that. Somebody was acting as a boy and then broke up with the girl after a while. Then the girl went and killed herself.|`|40qTdKuPaa	No, its not safe to meet anyone online. You dont know this guy, or what he does, you cant trust a stranger, no matter how comfy you feel with him. So, no, do not trust him, be friends with him, but never really meet him and dont have a relationship with me. Kids get killed becuase of this.|`|iQqsdl5yaa	Just be careful with people that you do meet online...I mean there is a chance of finding real love with someone on line, my boyfriend and I met online and we have been together for more than a year and we live together....but I remember when I was online dating sites, there are alot of creepy people that are up to no good, especially with young women like you...so just be careful and continue to not give any personal information like you have, i.e. phone number, last name, address, etc....Get his phone number after awhile and block your number and call him and see how he sounds, people can be totally different from what they type...

XiMQLv8Oaa	Hector, I presume, this could be answered in the realm of Psychology and what's higher still.  It can't be denied that matter vibrates at various frequencies. In fact, it was proven by science that these vibrations could be enhanced to good effect or resonated to, which could be disastrous. Microwave ovens work this wise. And this "resonance" could cause the breakdown of bridges.     Humans also possess frequencies by which their minds and consciousness are vibrating  at. It is this subtle mental waves that make two people attuned to each other. It determines whether the consciousness are sympathetic or repulsive to one another. Some oriental disciplines believe that by attuning to the mental frequency of an individual is the way to connect to that individual's mind set, and even feeling his moods and pains. And not only that, once a mental connection is made, it is even considered possible to communicate. Mental telepathy? Thought transfer? Anything is possible. The mind has limitless capabilities.    And there, sympathetic vibrations could lead to the meeting of the minds. And the common bond, in interests, harmonious outlook, ideas, philosophy in life, could develop into deep friendship, and ultimately love for ideally suited minds of oppossite genders.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	That is one of life's great questions.  Have no answer for you though...    Why have I fallen for the wrong people?  That's what I wanna know!|`|B1mEwSXWaa	My dear Hector...    Well.....LOVE is a learned phenomenon to begin with...Love is a learned, emotional reaction. It is a response to a learned group of stimuli and behaviors.    Love is NOT a "thing". It's NOT a "commodity" tat can be bartered for or bought....or sold, nor can it be forced upon or from someone! It can only voluntarily be given away !!! Love is always OPENED ARMS !!!To love others you must love yourself, because you can only give away, what you carry within.     To live in love is life's greatest challenge- and there are soooo many facetts of love....-Real LOVE always creates, it never destroys-    Love is like a mirror. When you love another, you become his mirror and he becomes yours......- One does NOT..."fall in -or- out of love"...one GROWS in LOVE-!!!     Love is NEVER complete in any person. There is always room for growth ! At each point in a person's life, his love is at a different level of development as well as in the process of becoming. It is foolish to feel that one's love is ever completely realized or actualized. Perfect love is RARE INDEED !!! It is to be wondered, if any man has ever achieved it. This does not mean, that it may not be possible, nor a goal devoutly to be strived for. In fact, it is our greatest challenge, for love and the self are one and the discovery of either is the realization of both ! Love is only ONE kind...-LOVE IS LOVE-    I could go on....and...on with this subject, but I want to give someone else a chance to express themselves...    May you create all the love in the world for you and enjoy the process of loving, my dear !

There are probably hundreds of reasons.I think if you take out the number of people, especially young ones, who mistake lust for love it would narrow the field greatly. When I think about it I believe it's because the someone you fall in love with strikes a spark, not just physical attraction, although that's probably the main reason, but also a certain sense of humor, someone that reminds you of a parent, someone you feel comfortable with right away....lots and lots of reasons. To me the sad thing is that love does not conquer all and if you are one of the unlucky ones that falls in love with the wrong person you can end up living a miserable life, even if you do love hat person.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G In the analysis, without strumming guitars and flower petals, of the process that leads up to falling in love, it becomes clear that decisions about what is attractive and what is repelling are involved.|`|TY21iw5taa	Chance.|`|qJrTInyBaa	sexual chemistry or animal Magnetism.

Immediately after you get home from school, tell him to do his home work. A routine will be very helpful in getting him organized,  because he'll be less forgetful. Routine is very important.    Finally, make sure you tell him that you're proud of him.

So if your looking for that type of guy, you won't find them easily.     2.The guys that like you may not be perfect.  They might be a little fat, or nerdy, or whatever.  So you ignore and/or belittle them.  So they don't ask you out.|`|XsYrhdY2aa	Ok so if your known in your school for being shy and not saying to much to guys then think about this.  Guys want to be comfortable.  Guys want to be able to talk to girls and not feel awkward.  They don't want to always have to come up with the conversation and keep it going.  I don't ever go out with girls that are shy because of this reason.  I want a girl who has something to say when I don't have anything to say.  So basically just start talking more and talk to more guys.  I hope this could help.

rGnszJ1Raa	Yes, and a guy that did that is probably gay. No I'm just kidding - there are times when rash decisions are made, and it is very possible for him to feel overwhelming grief, and he may realize his mistake. Just take notice that if ya'll were to split up again, then he came back again, that he is disrespectful and views you as a fallback, and at that point you say "**** you".|`|06Z3fh4laa	He sounds more desperate than anything. You're probably twisting it to make it seem worse than it actually is, whether you realize it or not. Then again, how the hell would I know how he feels?
BB76pnzzaa	First off, I don't know hold old you two are, but this girl seems really insensitive to your feelings, and you would probably be better off with another girl. As a pretty attractive twenty year old girl (not to be conceited or anything), I think I can give you some advice. I think it's nice that you try not to stare, but staring off into space can make you appear a little weird, so I would advise to look at a girl in the eyes when talking to her, and then just focus on something else when you're not (i.e. talk to a friend, read something in class, etc.). Also, getting her number from other people was a BAD idea. It makes you appear like a stalker, and it just looks like you are too aggressive. Next time, ask the girl for her number yourself. She will appreciate it more, and respond much more positively. Lastly, if she doesn't like you, respect that and focus on school, and eventually some other girl will come along. The more you try to get close to this girl, the more she will freak out. Good Luck!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You may want to avoid this drama for a while right now.  It seems that this girl does not appreciate you and your feelings and later, she was not interested in you like that.  However, she has no right to treat you with disrespect.  This is not the girl that you would go for.  You may want to find another girl who can make you happy.  By the way, next time, don't get the girl's number from her mutual friend, because that will make you look like a stalker.|`|MG7CLjtjaa	Ok firstly you sound like a very sweet guy, so SHE is the one who is losing out. Not you. She must be shallow if she rejects the fact that you like her. I wouldn't say she totally rejected you though. This girl is just playing games, and she isn't serious about you. You were serious about her though, right? Well there it is. Stop paying her so much attention though. If you kinda ignore her for a while, she will notice and wonder what happened. Don't be so available.    & Don't worry about people talking. Go to school and make it seem like this didn't bother you. Like you're over it, even if you aren't. I think you'll be okay... this girl may not be right for you. But crushes come and go. There are PLENTY of girls out there.|`|bxqwIjyeaa	it happens to the best of us|`|pQBjqMkoaa	lol that sucks|`|0fabfcfbe06b34a491d903e768e1f239aa	Move on Honey there is not much you can do about it|`|FHrQzaPqaa	when she thew the note away that when you should leave that alone.  you told her how you feel and she threw the note away. it is a lost  clause. you can find someone better than her.|`|ZRbTdQ6iaa	ok? srry icant be bothered reading but...i guess u jus hav to move on, everyone gets rejected once or twice in ther life|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	It takes a lot of courage for someone to ask another one out. It took me a long time to build the courage to ask my girlfriend out. Advice... move on, find another girl. She doesn't like you back. I'm sure that's not what you wanted to read, but it's the truth.|`|va3Ysr8vaa	keep at it dude, everybody is nervous around girls, just don't even think about it, just make sure she knows that you like her|`|AA11367901	Obviously she is not interested. If she was at least she would be nice to you. If I were you I would just let her be. When she was mentioning your name she must have been saying you were interested in her.    She would tell her friends if she liked you.|`|5ZRLTz7Jaa	Wow Jr High should be not hard since ah u will never be with her until u die.So ah High School will be different and rejection is standard|`|I1BW7YqIaa	Dude u should keep up with letting ur feelings out !

SHE SOUNDS LIKE A TOTAL B*TCH. IF SHE WAS GOOD GIRL SHE WOULD KEEP THINGS TO HERSELF AND NOT LET EVERYONE KNOW YOUR VERY PRIVATE FEELINGS. STOP TALKING TO HER OR ABOUT HER. INFACT IF YOU HAVE TO PRETEND YOU LIKE SOMEONE ELSE, DO IT! TOTALLY IGNORE HER AND SEE HOW SHE REACTS.|`|6ix7aBSRaa	It happens to all of us. I'm 21, and too afraid to even consider tryin, even though it's the logical thing to do. At least you have guts. You did the right thing, and hey, it's her loss, not your loss.|`|RDxhQonWaa	there's more rejection in life so she didnt like you back **** her her loss but dnt let this bug you i had rejection i use to be the quite girl and i actually liked the asses i go over and wispered in there ear i liked them and rejection came after words but now i dnt have that problem now its wow easier i dnt get rejection much often cuz you learn as you get older if they like you and they arent players or bitches  just when the guys/girls tease bout you likin her just laugh and pretend it doesnt bug you
ui54xkRNaa	i was in the same situation, and what i did was that i told them both that they r both my friends and that i would be there for them whenever they needed me but i wouldnt side on any of their fights cause they both mean to much to me than the stupid fights they were having. support them both and give them both the alone time with you they both need, its hard at first but after awhile they should learn to accept that u there for them and will get used to it. hope i helped.|`|a03f3ec9b8072b6807ba78a4bf8a1669aa	If I were you, I would make peace with both friends....Then have the bright idea that you three hang out together all the time...Like the girls in the traveling pants story...    Since three can be a crowd,   all three of you sit down for lunch one day and come up with some guide lines...Do not talk about eachother b/hind others back, etc...If something needs to be said about the other, then talk to that person as your friend.  Make a pact to be honest with each other and have lots of fun being together shopping, the show, bowling. That is after helping Mom at home with a couple of chores and your room!   Its only fair...
Hx2raTNQaa	tell me the  s and ill email the combo 2 u i will email u this
AA11909552	I say, "Yes, he likes you!" If he didn't, you would sense a difference in him, but you don't. So, that is a good thing. You would have seen a distinct change in his attitude if he didn't like you.  I wouldn't necessarily go stepping on another girls toes right away, though. Perhaps you should let THAT pan-out a little, first. You don't want any new enemies.  Just start talking to him more, on the sly. Your interaction with him will help you for the long run. Eventually, you two could become close friends and then BAM! He'll say something great, like, "Hey! How come we weren't friends before all this?" or something in that general vicinity. Great relationships start out as great friendships FIRST.  I think you have a good shot with him. Just-only wait for him to become more-available before you start making any kind of moves, first.  Good luck!
783Ve5Pnaa	Something I remember about almost any girl I have met is the way she smiles. Smiles can say a lot about a person. They can be happy, sad, forced, fake, flirty, sexy, curious, and many more. Smiling can be a powerful tool. I love when girls smile at me. So, I would have to say that a girl's smile is what I remember about her the most.|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	just if she is a really nice person, and is good looking.|`|JbdNFTj0aa	The eyes!|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	I'm not sure a girl can say something so 'special' off hand to a guy that he would remember.  That would only work if she knew the guy well, or was willing to say something racy and sexual(you'd have to say something you would never say...)    Mostly a guy will remember the girls appearance and looks.
AaoclPYCaa	Any man that does not like Valentine's Day is not worth keeping!  Dump him.  He is afraid he is going to have to buy you something.|`|JERUmEFzaa	Well I think you should tell him you like him and ask him out. Than he will probably end up loving valentines day again ;).|`|zwdGBrUZaa	kiss him and give him a gift that shows u care about him  maybe then he'll change his mind knowing someone has feelings for him|`|8U23iLKVaa	do it before valentines day. i mean why are you going to do something on a day he doesnt like, when ur trying to get with him. kind of hint it out to him now..|`|Wuypu9J9aa	just do it already. why wait till valentines day. it's over-rated anyways.|`|TxcpzRdRaa	If you're friends with him then give him something good. Not a heart of chocolates or a box of candy hearts. But a movie he likes or a video game or book. And make up something cute to say with it, like it's a happy anti-valentine's day present...or give-a-dvd-to-your-crush day...something like that.  If you aren't friends with him...don't do anything...it would just be awkward since he doesn't like the day.|`|nhnHvg1Maa	lol kiss him ^_^|`|hYudRhr2aa	tell him to be a man and quit whining about how many lonely nights he had on that day before|`|9LLKBKOmaa	Tell him that its just another day to celebrate the way you both feel about each other and you would like to take advantage of that day & it really means alot to you.
1uRUaSblaa	It sounds like a crush which should get over in time.  You may be at an age where you are not exactly sure about your feelings.Hang around with more positive people, get involved with more activities. Put away thoughts about unnatural relationship with your brother's ex-gf.It will not do you any good to dwell on such thoughts. How would your brother feel about that?  A mind diversion would do you much good.|`|dt4jhryFaa	tell her your really into her.. and she is sexy as hell.. haha just kidding.  ask her if she would like to haver her first lesbian experience with you.. really it just comes down to being forward and honest
1uRUaSblaa	I believe they are far more awkward and embarrassed than you are.  Just act like normal and time will ease the awkwardness.  Anyway, they were just doing what normal loving couples do.  Get busy with friends and activities and let that episode   fade gently away from your mind,ya?:)
o8nrXG8paa	I'm the girl in the thing she wrote if anybody didnt no so all i have to say is that i get it and im not mad at you. i was pissed off that i wrote that thing back for no reason. lol so we cool bestie|`|LaxiHwZZaa	i think u should not have pranked her like that if you knew that she is sensitive and doesn't like the boy eventhough everyone says she does.|`|Yp8vcfj2aa	Okay, honestly people may think this is a joke, but friendship is sosososo important, and boys honestly will come and go. but a good friendship doesnt always come around. That wasn't cool, i know how it is when your hurt and you act out. So, you should probably really make a heartfelt apology.|`|AA10280709	In truth you may have just been playing but the thing you have to remember is that the other person may not know that. We never know how someone is going to preceive what we speak especially in writing. Everybody thinks and perceives differently.  All you can do is work with what you have.  I would suggest you consider writing one more letter. A sincere apology. Not so much talking about the issue at hand, you both already know what that is. Write a letter stating what this person means to you, the significance of them in your life and the hopes you hold for resolving this issue asap because the bond of love between two people in any style of relationship is pricelss, no mans coin can purchase it. Itis freely given and can be taken away with a great sacrifice; the loss of them in your life.  Was the joke worth it? No.  This is a great time for you to reflect and think before you speak about another outside of yourself, begin to think how another might take it or feel about it. It is always better simply to say what we mean and mean what we say that way there is no room for miscommunication. This is the stepping stone to healthy relationships.  There is no need to explain why you did it, it doesn't matter because the both of you have already seen opposition, so simply walk your 50 yard line and ask them to meet you in the middle.   Best of luck, I hope you get your friend back, they sure are hard to come by!
Pa3hWJ5saa	I know your a little young for a few of these ideas but hope some of them help!    16. Take turns singing cheesy out-of-tune ballads at karaoke.oddcast.com or free karaoke.com.    17. Have your own version of trick-or-treating: Put on a sexy outfit and knock on the den door. Don't forget the treats!     18. Enjoy a rousing game of Twister.     19. Dress up your backyard picnic table with a white tablecloth. Add candles, fancy cheese, chocolate and voil: five-star fun.     20. Too cold or wet for an outdoor picnic? Spread a blanket on the floor and have a carpet picnic.     21. Make a mixed tape or CD.     22. Create a beer garden: Scour local stores for unusual beers.    23. Invest in an ice-cream maker or a bread maker; then invent your own homemade treats.    24. Curl up with the Sunday crossword puzzle.    25. Order live lobsters, plop them in a pot and have yourselves a shore thing. (Try livelob.com, which even has a cooking guide.)    26. Bring home your favorite fast food, but serve it on your best china.

ppuqLBMBaa	good that your friends  i totally agree with you on the corny pick up lines b.c you have to know how to say them to make them cute and not sappy    anyway you can go up to her or something and just ask her or maybe be simple and take it slow by saying heyy would you like to go out this weekend or maybe just say hang out...its a great way to start since you dont know if she likes you|`|3HhhHWd4aa	1) Walk up to her.  2) Say, "Will you go out with me?"    Simple.    Done.|`|KcYaPYhhaa	Before I tell you what to do, I'm gunna ask you a question, Do you ever talk to her? If not than try to get to know her better. Then ask her out. But what you should say is this:    Hey, I was wondering if you would be my girlfriend?     If she says no just say "Oh, alright, well that's ok! See ya around." and smile at her.     Don't make things awkward. That's a big turn off.    Good luck!|`|sCGWcJTFaa	Yes after you get to know more about her and be comfortable around her.
R0glUtExaa	Not really...Its like algebra opposites attract. You just have to find things to talk about. Like what you did over the weekend and what things go on in your life even if its the littlest thing if they truly love you then they will be willing to listen to anything you have to talk about.|`|mOxVL0luaa	nope u just need to talk about her fav stuff and she will try to dug up ur fav interest ^^|`|626efa044358e718840b4df8894964f1aa	Well, you gotta have some other interests to have been with her for 3 months now. GL dude.|`|ucLtm2Uiaa	think of somethings to talk to her bout..like maybe music..like if you ike this kind let her listen to some of it and if she likes it..there you go. my boyfriend and me have little in common but we have made it almost 1 1/2 year

35d2zC5Faa	In the end, she will be the one with the broken heart. I know you don't realize this, because you are still in school. When we are in school, we think like she does...that she will never break up with him. She will. They won't last. and when he is gone, you will still be gone. She will have lost you both. Her loss. Not yours. You will move on to better guys and better friends and do so with the knowledge that you didn't stab anyone in the back. Can she say that?|`|FkE5ORinaa	aite imma guess this is middle school drama, aaand just to let you know after you get over this which you will eventually or when your in high school, your gunna think how stupid this was and laugh about it. well you should seriously move on, avoid em if you dont feel like talking to them, you should do what you feel like, if you flirt with the guy alot after then he'll either reconsider you or take advantage of you so watch out if your going to try and get at him again, which i recommend not doin, i've tried before wen i was in middle school. plus obviously your "bff" is not being sucha good frend and everyone lies in middle school to become cool or to get w.e they want. and dont think of dating some kid in middle school like ur guna marry em , have fun, its only temporary 90% most likely. middle school dating is all kid-ish stuff but very serious for u guys. so remember to not take it so seriously but have fun.|`|tbQX8bRGaa	well you just let a GUY ruin a strong friendship i say talk with your friend and forget the guy|`|FAj1AinFaa	well i think that no guy is worth a friendship but u might think diffferent!just make him jelous!....

MYbRICxqaa	Yes, you were too young. I can tell you young just by saying "third base." You just need to be a kid. Don't worry about that stuff right now.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Way too young.|`|76Wp8OINaa	No, its fine|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	amish are married at that age... its what ever YOU think... do you think it was to young?|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Yes it was a BAD decision! But the bad feeling will leave you after a few days (its 100% normal to feel that way after you first time).|`|RmZZ1MKraa	It's kinda young but it's not that bad. As long as your not doing that With every guy your with then I wouldn't worry to much about it|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Oh yes you were to young.  But the deed is done and I am glad that you realize that now what a mistake it was.  This will always be in your mind but don't dwell on it.  Let your mind and body grow into a really nice young woman first.  Sex is  not a sport for kids to play at.  The consequences are so real.  STD's, AIDS, babies, diapers, angry parents lawyers, doctors etc etc.  Just put this behind you and stay celibate for a few more years. Get into your school work and helping your Mother at home.  Your reward will be your pride, your composure and your sweetness.|`|ddWyRjmVaa	no point in worrying about it now.  its over with. you cant change it by worrying.|`|8s9q4V03aa	third base?use regular words|`|BL9CQgcAaa	No, that wouldnt be too young and why didnt you go all the way aslong as the boy isnt over 18 both of you will be ok dont worries|`|tO8ey3o8aa	thats ur opinion  i think so though|`|rydsklvWaa	Hey, at least it was only third base!|`|ThfHrcc4aa	What the **** is third base, is that oral????|`|tuvlFJdsaa	its not a huge deal, in a way you should be complimented, but like that is young, theres a girl in my school who has gone all the way and now no one likes her and she feels terrible, she just sucks altogether Its fine, its not like its someting that you can never reverse.|`|915705d92192ca14561aef0c15a747e6aa	what are u talking about?   sex?|`|eqkzYHJtaa	look on the bright side, at least you didnt hit it home to 4th base.  if it was your virginity then you probably do have a good reason to feel bad. but just learn from the mistake and move on.|`|AA10934463	personally i think that is to young i don't think you did it out of love for the other person might just have been cuz he wanted to and you couldn't say no . and how old ws this guy ..more info please !|`|gQKLrKX4aa	maybe you should try going to confession.|`|C9EsAFACaa	i dont think you was to young because im in the 8th grade and given 2 bj's and i had sex with someone    dont even worry about =)|`|DUPOEk1daa	Is 3rd base oral sex?

y82sfBM9aa	For a woman seduction is easy, as guys are easily aroused.     If you're in the bedroom Just sit him down and give him a slow tease, Keep eye contact nd don't forget to smile/smirk...As you want to keep it playful. Keep the lighting of the room low and romantic and have some smooth sensual music in the background, As this subconsciously triggers sexual feelings.    In a public place it's sort of the same but more subtle, Touch(known as kino) can be very seductive and quickly show attraction/spark arousal. Whispering into the ear with all your dirty thoughts is VERY seductive, specially if it's slow and smoothly spoken.    Experiment with everything and you'll find your own way of seducing a guy. I've just picked these ideas up through gf and observing people at clubs etc. Many women have different little things that they do. Some girls are very upfront and expressive towards a guy and some are very subtle...They all work.|`|nqmGblKlaa	You look like a bi aatch (from that pic) lol|`|8dhBinAsaa	to turn a guy horny play with some ice      **** what other people say they should juged them selves|`|DCnapaC7aa	be m gf please|`|Bdo2GNA2aa	i don't judge you by your picture i judge you by this,    About me:  hey im melissa candice but just call me mel. im a girl from australia. i love boys, my girls, movies, music, partying, shopping, and pink! im also a model and i love what i do :)    haha, like 5 people have blocked me because i gave them truthful answers. if you ask a question, i will give you the honest answer. if you dont like it, tell someone who cares.    add me.  xoxoxo|`|1oGBByMIaa	show your boobs|`|w2yh8Acraa	you look like a whore... you shudnt have a problem...|`|cxVmq2kraa	If he's not expecting it whisper things into his ear in public places or just unzip him pants aha if you want to do it.|`|UwFb8cleaa	take it a step at a time, i like girls that are hard to get but not impossible, give a little signs, make it the whole experience longer, i mean you wouldnt like if id come out naked into your room with my c0ck hanging out rite...|`|CCzVoj2saa	It depends where you are on what you can do.. if your at a public place, like school or work, or the mall, don't be all over him, because that makes some guys uncomfortable. Just do small things, like lightly brush up against him, smile at him (smiling makes you look aproachable, and depending on the smile, it can be sexy). And if you guys are alone you can do a lot more things, like make a lot of eye contact (thats translated into confidence, and thats really sexy to guys, especially if you have pretty eyes) and touch him a lot. You don't want to seem too foward, because that can SOMETIMES be considered classless, and if you like this guy, which I'm assuming you do, you don't want him to think well of you.   Goodluck.
64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	just ask him to practice that scene with you a few times.

sebhK7r7aa	Just ignore that feeling that tells you to be quiet.|`|QEPb6sjRaa	*Shyness and free advice about how to stop being too shy*    Being shy could be a cute personality trait but it can also be a problem if its over whelming. If Shyness is so strong that it keeps people from communicating clearly people should change. Shy individuals can slowly but surely by doing things that make them more assertive or confident. When shyness is out of control and detrimental to your social well being  it's time to find ways to over come it. Being shy can make you seem weak or easy. Giving others that impression can have a many consequences.   At times shyness can cause blushing which can also be a little embarrassing. If you feel embarrassed often, you might be shy and not know it. If you are so timid that people walk over you there is a major problem and that might put your life in danger.    Shyness and being passive    Being shy usually comes with being passive or being indecisive. If you are passive, your shyness will allow others to take advantage of you for being so bashful. Passiveness and indecision will only lead to a life of discomfort. If your shyness gets to the point that you start sweating for the slightest things or you wet yourself (your shirt with all the sweat) you should start doing something about it.    Positives and negatives about being shy    Shy people usually don't get paid as much because they don't speak up. Well, there are a few advantages of being shy: It's easier to get along with others, most shy people avoid fights or arguments, shy people are calming to others, being humble is a good thing and many other things. The disadvantages of being shy are: people taking you for granted, insecurity, being ignored, indecision and other things that come when people aren't heard or understood.    Shy personalities    If you have a shy personality there's no need to force yourself to be someone you're not but if it's interfering with your well being or success you can find ways to change things. First of all make sure to express your feelings and thoughts clearly to others. There's no good reason to fear being yourself. Talk to complete strangers a few times a week and practice being social even if you're fluttered at first. Eventually you'll come out of your shell.    Things that cause Shyness:    fear, indecision, insecurity, being a loner, lack of self confidence, depression, being alone, being too unsocial, constant indecisiveness, being a coward, psychological problems, it can also just be a personality trait or fear.     *How to over come shyness*:    1. Make it a point to express what you feel or think at least once a day with friends or family even though you're shy, your shyness won't bite. Try to do the same with a complete stranger 1 a week.     2. When looking at mirrors make to compliment yourself out loud or in your head. Say things you would tell someone you love or deeply care about.    3. Understand that you can only be yourself. Know what you want and try to make up your mind quicker but stay very precautious. Its always best to be safe then sorry.      Shyness can be something that you have complete control over if you know how to take care of yourself and find courage in the truth. See the links bellow for further advice.|`|z8WIAhDVaa	just be yourself... talk to people, answer more questions in class, be yourself.
nE95Hnn5aa	I am sorry to hear about your visitation issues.  10 years ago I was involved in my own custody/visitation case, and one thing that I can say is that the one who attempts to pursue peace and a win/win compromise, with the children's best interest at heart is the one that will prevail.  Hopefully that will be all the adult parties involved.  However, I found this article that might help you cultivate the right Christian attitude while you are going through this situation.  I am not trying to push or convert my religious beliefs on you or your family, but, I believe that this is just good information, and how to apply Bible principles.  Please read:    Child CustodyA Balanced View    OFTEN, the real challenge comes after the divorce, in a struggle for the affection and control of the child. The saying It takes two to fight is not always true. It may take only one domineering parent who wants his or her own way. A family attorney in Toronto, Canada, observed: In family law, everything is very emotionally charged and close to the heart.    Instead of thinking of the childs best interests, some parents keep the dispute going by filing motions on irrelevant issues. For example, some have tried to prove that custody should be changed because the other parent is one of Jehovahs Witnesses and will deprive the child of a normal way of life.    How does a Christian meet the challenge of such emotionally charged arguments? An emotional responsefighting fire with firewill not be effective. If the matter is taken before a judge, each parent will have an opportunity to be heard. It is most important to keep in mind the Bible counsel: Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to totter. (Psalm 55:22) By meditating on this and by applying Bible principles, parents can, with Jehovahs help, cope with any eventuality involving child custody.Proverbs 15:28.    Reasonableness    The best interests of the child are the key issue. If a parent is overly demanding, he may lose custody and even find his visitation privileges restricted. The wise parent conducts himself in a peaceable manner, keeping in mind the Bible counsel: Return evil for evil to no one. .?.?. Yield place to the wrath .?.?. Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good. (Romans 12:17-21) Whether in court, in a lawyers office, or with a child-custody evaluator, parents need to let [their] reasonableness become known to all men.Philippians 4:5.    Sometimes an estranged spouse will try to deceive others by introducing misleading and speculative problems. It is wise to fight the human tendency to overreact to these verbal attacks. Health, religion, and education are favorite subjects that estranged spouses use to fabricate mischief at a custody-dispute hearing.Proverbs 14:22.    Reasonableness includes the ability to consider the facts and negotiate a fair agreement. No parent should forget that even after divorce, the child still has two parents. The parents have divorced each other but have not divorced the child. Therefore, except in extreme circumstances, each parent should have the freedom to act as a parent when he or she has the child. Each should have the freedom to express his or her feelings and values and have the child share in the parents lawful activities, religious or otherwise.    Visitation Privileges    It is unrealistic for parents to view child custody as having a winner and a loser. Parents are successful and win when they see their children grow into mature, competent, respectable adults. Success in child rearing is not directly tied to legal custodianship. By heeding court-ordered conditions in child-custody matters, even when these appear to be unjust, a Christian shows subjection to the superior authorities. (Romans 13:1) It is also important to remember that this is no time to vie for the affection or loyalty of your children by belittling the other parent in an attempt to destroy his or her relationship with them.    There are Bible examples of God-fearing parents who, for various reasons, were separated from their children. For example, Amram and Jochebed, the parents of Moses, acting in the best interests of their child, placed him in a little floating ark among the reeds by the bank of the river Nile. When the infant was retrieved by Pharaohs daughter, they maintained their trust in Jehovah. These wise and faithful parents were rewarded with generous visitation privileges that they effectively used to train the boy in Jehovahs way. Moses grew up to be an outstanding servant of the true God.Exodus 2:1-10; 6:20.    Continue to hold a good conscience before man and Jehovah by applying Bible principles, treating your estranged spouse honestly, and showing flexibility in your custody agreements. It is better to suffer because you are doing good, if the will of God wishes it, than because yo|`|985b69c21f5ec27c902473285145042baa	Just pray to the Lawd Christ Juh-eezus.

lQXJwUOkaa	Ok I must say you are going through a lot at 13 however it is no more than the average person going through puberty....Therefore you being a little dramatic....Here what you do number one enjoy your teens years because they are going to just fly by... Secondly go stay with you mom believe she don;t forget you her child she is busy with the new baby because it need way more attention than you heck it can't do nothing for itself, however do talk to her and tell her that you feel like she leaves you out and that it hurts your feeling. As for mood swings and no you not going to depression you just have a lot of feeling bottled up that need to be released ...I not sure of your faith however pray to God and ask him to help you thorough the rough times. And as for your dad you need to tell him that you know what he is doing and when he ask how tell him cause your brother is doing the sam thing because that is a big problem...however just talk to your mom she will understand you......best wishes honey|`|vlEeaB4baa	Your life is not over at 13.

AA10949869	Hehe, I actually asked him:) I don't remember my exact words but it was a little different with us. We were best friends and falling in love with each other just wasn't an option in our heads because if things didn't work out where would our friendship stand. So, we went on denying our feelings for each other and resisting the urges we had just to "save" a friendship. I got tired of it, I asked him to take a walk with me and I just basically said something like...I have feelings for you, I can't hide them anymore and I want to take a chance on a relationship with you. If our friendship doesn't survive if things don't work out romantically between us then maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Wanna take the chance? And he said yes.  NOW, we are married and expecting our first child:) She is due to arrive March 29th and hubby and I have been together almost 6 years. Sooo glad I asked!|`|oOR511mFaa	I met my guy on the internet.

The text said to turn around. I was like "What". I kept walking and I got another text saying "Just turn around", from Dylan. I finally did, and he was right behind me. He gave me a huge bear hug, and that was when we had our first kiss. It was before we were even dating, but it was so sudden that it was sweet.

FXCoGD44aa	It's because a romantic relationship cannot truly be successful if both people are not attracted to each other. You can not fall in love with someone you do not find asthetically pleasing, even if they have the world's best personality. Likewise, you also can't fall in love with someone who looks like a supermodel, but doesn't have a compatible personality. It needs to be a mix of both.    Also, every person is different with their preferences. What one guy may think to be pretty, another may not and vice versa. The same goes for personalities - God knows theres millions of "good" personalities out there... it's just a matter of what one particular individual perfers.    There's lots of other factors that are necessary to foster a successful relationship. Having the same core values, having similar [[not necessarily identical]] interests or ones that compliment each other, having the same general direction in life, having the ability to meet each other's needs, etc.    I understand that you are young. Adolescents seem to think that it's either looks or personality... cut and dry. The human race is far more dynamic and diverse than that.

7g8UHUJgaa	did you guys ever go out?? sounds like THAT kind of drama to me.    i had a similar situation. me and me "old" best friend talked ALL summer long and he said he loved me but i was not sure if it was friend or more kind of love.      when the summer was over, things changed and he completly ignored me one minute and talk to me the next.    i did not know what his deal was.    sometimes we girls miss a MAJOR point about a guy when the point RARELY comes around.    sometimes we have no idea what it is we have done. (in my case, maybe i did not tell him i loved him back. lol)    me and him do not really talk anymore (diff. cliches in high school)...come to think of it, i forgot his number too..lol    but YES rebuilding is always good.    once he graduates (i graduated last yr '08!!!!) he will miss EVERYTHING about high school...and you, im sure.    whatever it is will blow over.    guys have boy drama!...strange how he has mood swings like PMS. LOL!!!    anyways, rekindle the friendship. it is for the best!!!

That's my situation too.  Except I'm a guy...  and I liked her, she didn't like me, and now she does and I'm confused about how I feel.     I'm going to go for it though.|`|tSH2yKyvaa	I have the same problem, except he's with his girlfriend. Try for it now, before he moves on. I would.|`|C72xMgl4aa	let him know how you feel, and be truly honest. if he doesn't like you, move on and stay confident.|`|gyQTNC0Iaa	Well start talking to him again then text him. And after awhile things will just fall in place i hope i helped. Good luck!!!!!!!!!|`|oULsgDRJaa	That's so ironic isn't it?    You love him because he is no longer available ... you miss the attention that he was giving you.     Women are weird ... I love them to death, but they are so weird.|`|RzgIxp1jaa	Girl i can relate...that's basically my story....  My friends advice me to 4get about him cuz you need to have some self respect|`|7HwbzTheaa	I think you should give him some time like a week or so see what happens if he doesn't do anything in that week  try to tell him how you feel.|`|XsVHrccCaa	if u like him that much i think u should keep trying  nd if things dont work out u should stay as friends and move on  there r plenty other guys out there|`|2TC7aS8Baa	well don't be desperate if it happens  it happens. if doesn't oh well move on you'll find somebody better  just continue being his friend if you can and see how it goes from there   good luck|`|jRduMDOjaa	i did that before...you jusz got to pretend he doesnt evn exist..  hope i helped:P
mCUNl9Wgaa	False. My husband and I did not have sex before we married. While I have nothing against people who do have sex...It was a personal non religious choice. Anyways, we have been together 5 years, and 2 years married.|`|AA11812653	false.  While there are many men who only do that, there are also many other who do not.|`|gMYVvjzgaa	true.|`|AA11284982	depends... most guys wanna have as much as sex as they can when they are young its just the way we are... its biologically coded within us to reproduce when we are in our primes. but when they wanna settle down they too want someone theyd like to care about eventuallly.|`|EZ7FK5e6aa	usually true, depends on the man
4qL7oRrVaa	You messed up I guess badly enough if she sent you that email.    Take her word for everything she said, that she just doesn't want to see/talk to you ever again, and move on.    But please, learn from the mistake(s) you made with the next gf, and maybe fighting for another girl will be easier and more worth your time.|`|AA10652271	Just leave her alone.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	You've hurt her too much - she definitely doesnt want you back.    Learn you lesson - don't take someone for granted or treat them badly because it's quite likely they will never come back.    Treat the next girl better.|`|LMITI1I3aa	move on! its not worth the hassle...... or "internet harrassment charges" LOL    dont fight for a girl, it usually doesnt work out.     she's being perfectly clear about how she feels.
n8eRg88Faa	Oh god. well I was like ten when my dad got remarried. I felt betrayed and horrible. Because my mom had died two years earlier, I guess I felt that he was kicking her out of the family, and that she wasn't my mom anymore. I cried a lot. it was really hard for me to accept that someone else was with my dad. But now I realize that it was such a good thing that my dad remarried. I needed my step mom growing up. I needed her to teach me the things mothers are supposed to teach you when your a teen and getting ready to live on your own. I love her now:) If your daughter is struggling with the idea of a new step parent, make sure she knows that it's always good to have someone else there to give you advice, when others cant be there for you:)    good luck!|`|4boTYkt7aa	At first,I was jealous of him.I thought that he was coming in between my mom and me,but after a little time passed,I started to see that he wasn't taking mom's love away from me,he was adding his love to it.It's not easy to see your life changing but change can be great.Just think of it this way,Your step parent is your parent because they want to,not because they have to.There is a song that makes me cry because it says:"I wish I were half the dad my dad didn't have to be".May peace be with you.
zQQd2wPRaa	are you gay? why are you writing about another girl?|`|xXt6W17Faa	GAY|`|357BF35maa	wow.. very peppie!!! lolz lovs it!!|`|qjnH3f6Raa	In the last line I think its better like you make me wanna jump a mile.

You should talk to him some more.|`|ZRbTdQ6iaa	he lyks u|`|m3L6pLBaaa	yeah i would say he likes you.|`|3se8BaJLaa	stop jumping to conclusions , it may not mean that he likes you. maybe he is just a good person who enjoys helping others|`|Ud8n4Lknaa	idk he's probably new and i guess maybe he wants to know people, give him a chance and u know he mite be a cool person and or he might like u who knows... mysterious|`|FeRC5jkoaa	Well what the hell do you think einstein? I think you just like hearing that he likes you.|`|ba51f88439056818aa8eb5563894ffc8aa	The world needs more people like him.  He's not a random guy. He's a nice person who thought about you, even though he may not know your name, and went out of his way to make you feel comfortable and safe.  Count your blessings.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	He might like you, he might just be trying to make a friend too though, and he found an opportunity to talk to you about something, anything, even though it's as small as asking where you've been.    Keep chatting with him! Nice people are great to keep around as friends.|`|RVYVg7Craa	he likes you (:|`|PhivaI6Oaa	its called being nice..|`|WSCRgn8haa	He likes you....|`|H6Lc79EOaa	You are in college and still need affirmation?

Just in case he is a player.|`|dYd7yRBVaa	There are courteous people out there, though rare, they tend to worry about people they don't know.    Or he could like you.|`|AxYftL4caa	he likes you talk to him more. nd find out his name|`|CcHkZehoaa	STALKER!!!!|`|kv1Jtrngaa	Well you should get to know him more, before you assume he likes you. He just might be the curious type, or he was just being nice, and caring, or maybe he does like you it depends, go hunting for clues. If he continues, to question you over things, or talk to you, he might just be looking for a friend, but you never know. I think it is too soon to tell for sure....It could be a number of things. But, I would definitely, be curious about it, as you are...hmm...let me know the outcome......interesting....|`|Hx2raTNQaa	you should tlk to him see if he likes u (i think he does)|`|4ZKKrWWfaa	either he want to get to knw you or he just want to be friends... i mean like i had like a person i want to friends with and sometime awkward converstions,,,maybe that was his way for trying to be friendly and start a friendship....i really dont know.. its really random
BY6OSDSeaa	look, its best to get over him and dont even be friends, sorry,  but its true|`|3ctchU2faa	Strike up a conversation with him online or through a text expressing your wish to be friends. If he doesn't feel the same way, move on.|`|6wIfS0b9aa	if you cant talk to him in person, text him and just start a casual conversation with him. be like hey whats up and then say:    look. I dont want to completely ignore you for the rest of my life.  just because something bad happened between us we shoudlnt hate eachother. is there any way that we can stay friends?    and then just hope for the best|`|uxrFOOn9aa	no mish you want to be friends to start something once again. other wise you wouldnt care less if you still see him or not. its not going to happen move on with life sweet heart , dont go there he isnt into you anymore so you should leave well enough alone. sorry|`|y6v4ztM8aa	if he dumped u for know reason hes got bored... not trying to b a jerk but yeah.. or hes found someone else. orr he like the abilities of being single :]
sKFLyfjVaa	I knew a guy who did the same thing to me.  It seems that when he got rejected he took his frustration out by saying hurtful and inappropriate comments such as the book case.  I would say something to him that stops his ridiculous behavior once and for all.  And for your own good, keep your curiosity to yourself and him away from you.|`|sICqdaDzaa	Wow, what a jerk. I agree.|`|nqmGblKlaa	That guy is weird.... I can tell.
8YfYh3y0aa	You can probably put all that effort to good use in school, preparing yourself to be on your own.   Once you're out of the house and working, then you can do what the *** you want.     Till then, try to be considerate to those who love you.      and be patient.
e75a99c9cdf483e5829a4a39a532ff66aa	There has been a lot of research into the different ways in which the sexes diverge with regards to how they think and process information.  If I could recommend a book, "The Sexual Paradox" by Susan Pinker could go along way in explaining some of these differences.  As I am no expert, I can only go off of what I have read and experienced.      What I have noticed is that there seems to be a sense that what is natural for one sex is therefore natural for the other.  This is however not the case.  Monogamy may be the preference for one, and not the other.  Violence and fighting as a means of resolving disputes may be the preference for one and not the other.  When I say preference by the way, I do not mean to infer choice.  I only mean to suggest that it is what is most biologically intuitive.  The significance that you place on names and dates and faces would likely have some relevance to our early beginings.  His, and my, interest in what you refer to as random and useless information is also rooted in our ealy evolution.  This difference goes along way in explaining the differences in social networking and cohesiveness that exists among females, whereas males tend to form much weaker and short lived social bonds.  This lack of interest in social interaction however is made up for by the fact that males tend to have strengths in other areas.  Hunting, territorial disputes, and navigation are all areas where a memory for the "useless" all of a sudden become very usefull, whereas a memory for the birthdate of the person you are in disputes with, is not so usefull.    There have been studies done that exemplify this tendancy that males have, for interests in non human interaction.  Male infants for example would rather watch a mobile, or presumably another mechanical device, than look for any length of time at a persons face.  Female babies have little interest in the mobile, but will stare at great length at a face.  At a very early age there is this preferece that females have for human interaction.      This may help to explain why your BF has such a terrific memory for what you consider to be useless, yet he cannot remember your aniversary for example.  This is not to suggest that he does not want to make you happy, and that he "chooses" to forget things.  For you to expect him to memorize all of what you consider important would be no different than him expecting you to remember what he considers interesting or important.  It may be possible for you to commit all of that to memory, but not without putting in a lot of effort, and the same goes for him.    Hope this helps|`|lhOd2hvXaa	I wouldn't call it "a guy thing"....    Hate to admit it, but I bumped into this question by checking to see what my dear hubby had answered in the past few days.  Seeing the headline of the question I thought "oh crap, I bet he called me out on that one!"     Yup, I've been married to a wonderful man for 4.5 years and missed 2 out of 4 of our anniversaries.  The first one I actually volunteered to teach an extra session at the local dog training club that night because "I had nothing better to do" (completely forgot it).  Fortunately he had a good sense of humor about such things and knows that I don't have a mind for dates.  Thus far I have not forgotten his birthday :)    (Hi Danny B, I love ya!)|`|652c9c4ac00397e3d3a672481ae4771baa	Guys know about sports and cars.  Girls know about fashion and gossip.    Sure, those are stereotypes.  Still, they're true in many scenarios.|`|qAqsz3bBaa	I think it just comes down to what the guy likes. if he likes sports he will remember sports stuff, same with cars. And sport stuff comes up in a guys conversation a lot so they like to know something about it that way they don't feel stupid.|`|XhpLwjCuaa	Depends on the person discarding sex. He may have a different thought process then you. I am 20 years old and can hardly remember anything important but I can be in the middle of a conversation and remember that Youtube video I saw last week.|`|77lIzq4Taa	It depends where the priorities lie. I Know our Anniversary Wife's birthday ETC..  My Wife is the most important thing in my life, so to me it is easy to remember those important dates. Now there is a lot of useless random info floating around in my cranium, but the things that are important to me stand out like a flair in the dark.    DB|`|3F6brF2xaa	YA its true that most guys like that coz i proved that myself.... my reason fior this s GUYS dont really think of their woman so much wat they think s just themself how could they b happy and enjoy n life. i can also say that men think other woman more than their own partner|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	The thing is for me, is that I think about present instead of the past or future. We dont remember.|`|gMYVvjzgaa	hahaha. well i donno!  guys just happen to be different like that..|`|edq4QzCMaa	well football and cars and other things are important, its not just boys and girls ...never judge on gender,,, its about the individual|`|q5TchS9jaa	I don't know why, but guys have selective hearing. I know this because I catch myself wandering off all the time.|`|li9WGkzLaa	Well personally when i am in a relationship i do remember a lot of things but i just have good friends who remind me also i am very organized so i usually put dates in my palm i know a lot about cars but my girl would be more important to me good luck|`|sCGWcJTFaa	No I still remember my dates with my ex's. But I don't really know why, maybe they have A.D.D? And man also needs to love their hobbies and sports, you should respect them too for that.|`|GbLmBcIoaa	What you're confusing is memory with importance.  Just because a loved one is more important doesn't automatically make the details easy to remember.    You remember best what you think about often.  Anniversaries only come up once a year, and sports for many guys is something to think about every day, multiple times a day.    Ask him to draw you or tell you little things he likes about you.  Those are the sorts of things he thinks about often and will remember.
JsPSFADUaa	ok look their are a few things that can come out of this one he played you and he got your number for someone else not likley though two he just hasn't called you guys sometime take a while to call a girl they like babe it doesn't matter how non-shy they are lol ok now three it is possible that idk if he might have given him his number he might be waiting on you to call typicall guys feel like if they call a girl first than they seem well like a stalker idk y but we just do lol ok but the point is if he didnt give you his number he will call, and another thing for your self-satisfaction he does like you b/c in the book of man hood you dont just get a girls number for kicks idc how much of a pimp you think you are :-) so relax be a lil more patiant and things will work out  Hope I helped message me if ya need me    -The Love Doctor|`|sXT86Swqaa	Maybe he's shy when you get him by himself and not in front of his friends.|`|2b17c80ce64ad216b8306152f28b338aaa	y would you care?  get over it..|`|JYg0zp2Haa	hes scared you wont like him you gotta get into guys heads    http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1408848 6dzz5z5...|`|AxYftL4caa	maybe he's scared to call, ask him if he will call you tonight bc he might of lost it.|`|RDxhQonWaa	well he could of got cuz his friends dared him or he just did it to play with your mind  idk he prolly is nervous on the phone just go ask him for his and then be like you still got mine right? that wat i do|`|IgnCm6Wjaa	Yikes. He might be dissing you or something in the making. Sometimes boys get timid around girls so don't push him on it. He might be able to hold that against you. Just relax about it for a couple days and if a week passes give up on him and leave it like that.|`|NTlrnJEtaa	He is shy. Take it from another shy guy, he likes you and mustering enough courage to ask for your number was a lot. He is probably waiting for you to make the next move|`|b05bKonnaa	He's probably scared to call you, probably scared of if your parents pick up too, I have asked the girl I like for her number 4 times, and I still have all four notes with her number on them...  I have only called her twice, after I got the second note. Im scared of her parents and of embarassing her or myself, and I hate the way I talk so freakin soft arround her, I talk loud arround my friends, but for some reason really soft arround her.  I like her alot too...|`|uCyhALGMaa	Either he is shy or he asked you for   your number for one of his friends who might be into you|`|CyKwPm8maa	Even outgoing people are afraid sometimes. So maybe he was afraid you'd have nothing to talk about with him or you may reject him. Think about it... if you are so outgoing at all of that, wouldn't you still be afraid of some thing??|`|a1iam8Zvaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgBeu3FVi...    you'll feel better =]|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Maybe he has something going on with his personal life or maybe he does not have the guts to call you.|`|aKkDWz5Waa	maybe he stares at his phone but he cant figure out what he'd say if he did call u randomly/ is afraid u would find it strange for him to randomly call u.  either that, or he lost ur number.|`|aRIxPVcwaa	maybe he's scared. i think you should ask him i would. id be like "dude why'd you ask for my number if you werent gonna call?, i waited for you to call for like ever and nothing..." or maybe he's a jerk and just wanted to see if he could get your number. and really was never going to call you. sorry guys are f.u.c.k.ed up like that. but good luck|`|0fabfcfbe06b34a491d903e768e1f239aa	Maybe he is scare of calling you because your too cute or to smart or he doesn't want you to reject him.
J0RJ3MS7aa	you've been brainwashed by the teeange surge of sexual frustration...|`|4qL7oRrVaa	I think it really depends on why you think kissing is so important to do.      PS. you do care what people think otherwise you wouldn't be asking. If your hesitating like this, then it's not time yet.|`|5xvLzcvZaa	your finee, its not like your having sex ;)
0zmMikKHaa	Um. Maybe if you are calling her stupid and crazy and don't want to hear her talk, then she isn't really a good friend?|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Tell her politely??
AA11585182	You should talk with a grandparent or aunt, or someone fairly closely related to you.    If the "legit reason" is because they are abusing you, you NEED TO TELL THE POLICE!!!!    But as long as you are in their custody, they can shut down whatever plans you have to move out if they want to.    El Chistoso|`|uGezRb7Xaa	It seems like you are talking about moving in with a boyfriend then being abused.|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	Yes, they could stop you.  Until you are 18 years old, you are legally bound to them.    There are exceptions, however.  If one or both of your parents are being abusive (verbally, physically, sexually), the police can relocate you.    Otherwise, you will need to be emancipated (or divorced) from your parents.  That's a rather lengthy and complicated process that involves you standing up in court.|`|BT5yjNJmaa	yeah u can move out but whos going to provide with you with food, shelter, water, and transportation and money?!  so u better be working full time of actual work or forget moving out also u need to be independent|`|985b69c21f5ec27c902473285145042baa	Yes, they absolutely can stop you. The only way to legally move out at 16 is to get emancipated, but that's a long and complicated process. Unless your physical health is in danger, of course. In that case, contact the police.    Also, if you move in with someone else, if the adults in that home are aware that you're living there, they can be charged with harboring a runaway.|`|482c3c164b9ceae77a848c4b02f2704eaa	OH yeah. They can call the state and you could end up in state custody.    Now, if you're being abused, maybe you should be in state custody.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Be careful what you ask for little girl. You may be opening a can of worms you cant put back. If your moving out for a week or two involves a guy which I am pretty sure it does you could be asking for trouble for you both. You are 'about' 16 huh? That means you are 14 or 15 right? So he can go to jail for having sex with a minor and you can go to a juvenile centre for being uncontrollable. Or did you ever think that once you leave your parents who are probably totally sick of you doing what you want don't have to let you come back. What then? Yes of course they can stop you from moving out for a week or two. If it truly is a legitimate reason then either tell someone or go to the police with it. If someone is abusing you then tell your parents...if it is them then tell someone who can do something about it like a councilor or the police. If it is just a holiday with your boyfriend then think again because sometimes things go badly very quickly. Just because your parents love you doesn't mean that there isn't a line you shouldn't cross before they will act. Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind especially if they think they are helping you by stopping your bad behaviour.|`|7kG5leXYaa	i think they can..until your 18 you gota do what they say...or be a total rebellion and leave them for a long time...|`|YfI4qVh7aa	As your parents, they have a legal obligation to keep you safe.  I've known 16 year olds that went out on their own after having a massive falling out with their parents and seemed to get along well enough.  But I would highly suggest discussing things with your parents before making a harsh move like that.  You only get one set of parents, you know.|`|4YHlEurYaa	Yes they can stop u the fact is u r a minor and do not have the right to take care of yourself and law states that to be an legal adult at 18. however you can be emancipated which is where u can go to court and prove that u can take care of yourself at 16 but u would have to show that u had a job had a was of income and make enought per month to live on your own.|`|sWFIJtGmaa	I've been through the same exact thing hun. Trust me. I was in a horrible situation with my mother and she wouldnt let me leave the house and she wouldnt let me move out. Theres really nothing you can do unti lyou are 18.  Just hang in there. I promise it will get better. I hung in there and me and my mom are perfectly happy. But if your parents are abusing you mentally sexually or physically, you need to talk to an adult like your school counselor.  I went through the same stuff. I promise. It will get better.|`|ZtPCVAqtaa	yes they can stop you, your a child......end of story|`|qpdUbGm8aa	All i know is that once you are 18 you can legally move out because then u are classified as an adult and u no longer need to listen to ur parents but if you live with your mom but not your dad once you are 13 you can move to your dads and vice versa
50b446cc42d27523aeb81faf9e2a34aeaa	Well a "whore" is someone who generally has sex for money, falling under the same category as prostitutes.  A "ho" simply has sex for the pleasure and no money is involved at the end of the event :-P|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	If you don't want people to say a hoe is a garden tool, then spell it "ho."

PkRQNrUWaa	Don't sweat it love  I can assure you ur not the 1st to be in highschoo not have had a gf yet.  Many people that u probably know haven't either but they don't admite it until after theyr either more further down a steady relaitionship or left a serious1.  Sooner or later u'll grow the corouge to confront her in a coversaition ull be having w/her to invite her out to the movies or somewhere  It will come naturally  This happens with every single person sweetness so don't worry ur not alone &this won't b forever|`|GQ8aKXr6aa	Although I can't offer any dating help, it may comfort you to know that I'm 19, high school graduate, attending college and I too, have never had a girlfriend.. for the exact same reasons.

I think it's natural to feel like that.  Most all the teenage guys I know have trouble asking a girl out. It's just hard for someone who's shy.  But, seriously, a girl who likes you will be delighted by you asking her out. And if the girl laughs at you or doesn't even care about how hard it was for you to get up the courage to ask her out, well, she's not worth going out with. It's okay to feel like that, trust me. I have 5 older brothers who went through the same thing as you are going through. You will most likely grow out of it.|`|ODbwZsnoaa	you know honestly,  you just gotta go up to her and ask her.  what's the worst that can happen? rejection.  face it.  you fear rejection...all you need to do is tell yourself the world won't end if you get rejected  and if she says yes, than damn, congrats.|`|tPLoIMPCaa	first make sure you're friends with the girl.  then ask her to go hang out with you. not on a date. just hanging out. as friends.  do that a few times with just her until you feel comfortable enough to make your move for example hold her hand or kiss her cheek.  i know you're shy, but ask yourself: what are you scared of? what's the worst thing that could happen? what are you waiting for?!?!?!  :)
VUR8hhiTaa	I met my boyfriend on http://wwwsinglesnet.info  It took about a month, and he showed interest in me. I registered for a lot of different ones, and didn't like most. This one is the best so far, and the best thing is it is free!|`|yg5P4mBlaa	I am going to try online dating. I think the problems with online dating is that you might come off too pushy if you try and play it the same way as traditional dating, don't try and push the person to have a real date.    Also the next thing is safety, you need to be a bit more careful. Try these safety tips before going on a date you met online: http://blog.vintaku.com/2009/02/03/onlin...|`|jFfiNXbAaa	Pros - hmm nothing   Cons - everything    THEY COULD BE A FREAKING STALKER|`|xTDTlBLIaa	online dating is great..you can constantly hang out with and meet new people which is nearly impossible without online dating unless you are an extremely outgoing person that meets new people everyday which isn't the case for most..i love online dating|`|mgcW9fWXaa	Frankly, many people find online dating to be highly effective.    It has the advantage of being quick, easy and highly convenient; you can search through thousands of people to find good matches.     On the flip-side, it can be very difficult to accurately assess people from photos, profile text and email conversations. It's worth a try though!

647tRaZMaa	If a guy doesn't want you anymore, there's nothing in the world you can do to get him back. I'm in a similar situation as you are now. When he said that we should just be friends, my heart broke into a million pieces. But I believe in the saying that if he's yours, he'll eventually get back to you one day... if he doesn't, he was never yours to begin with.    Distract yourself with your other friends and engage in the activities you discarded last time. Don't contact him, don't see him, don't look for him, avoid him... if you still see him frequently, it'll just make it harder to get over him. I understand that you may miss him a lot initially, but as each day pass by, hopefully you'll think about him less, love him less, miss him less... Don't rush the healing process.    Lastly, always remind yourself of the reason why you can't be together anymore. It'll keep you from going back to him.|`|tI7QP3dkaa	Breaking up is always painful.  Nobody should ever suggest that you should  forget him because you won't.  He has been part of your life and  you need to hold those memories near and dear.      What you  need to do -  is get over him and move on.  Recognise the relationship and mourn it. Look at the good things and look at the bad. Set yourself a time period for doing this.  Once this time has past then  set some goals that enable you to move on to better things.
g39i8bJ1aa	just talk to himm u and he will feel better.  i bet he wants to talk to you too|`|O3ox6cbbaa	just walk up to him and start talking. tell him not to hate you and that you dont hate him because of what he/you did, or how either of you acted. its going to be awkward to start. it always is after a senario like this.|`|ZQa9qawHaa	A smile will probably do the trick. Why not simply say Hi or a simple Good Morning the next time you meet?|`|xyEJKLzZaa	when you pass him just start with a hey and gradually move on so its not so awkward|`|zwdGBrUZaa	the first thing you should do is explain to him that you dont hate him for what he did  trust me, just after you say that it will not be akward  it takes time  just talk and hang out, get closer

0LvWiESWaa	I think he needs to find a new friend, like yesterday. I cannot believe he has been talking to her and meeting her at a bar and you have never met her. It needs to stop.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	I'd whip her ***!and make him, yeah I said make him stop hanging out with her.|`|AA10461616	It doesn't matter who she thought she was talking to or if she was drunk, she still should not have referenced  herself as his girlfriend.  Men have women friends, but when a man defends his female friend over his wife, as your husband did by saying you were over reacting, that is a red flag 99.9% of the time.  Why is your husband going to bars with a female friend you have never met?  I am all for trust, and even if you do trust him, that still seems odd, like something only a married guy would do if his wife knew the lady and they were at least friendly as well.     From just what you have said, she wants your husband as more than a friend.  Why else would she use the LAME excuse she thought you were someone else?  Hoe does that justify it at all??? Had she been drinking and she was truly a friend of your husbands and didn't have grander ideas, she would have been mortified at making such an awful error (if it truly was one) and immediately met with you in person and explained she'd had too much to drink and said she was so embarrassed instead of running off like a girlfriend would do and telling your husband you had threatened her!  She is acting like you are his ex or something!     This lady is bad news.  Not only did she have a lame excuse, so did your husband when he said she gets confused when she drinks.  In fact, SHE never said or indicated it was an error- just your husband is saying that it was on her part, again he is defending her.  Seems he would be mortified too if they were only friends..   Makes me wonder what else she is getting confused about when she drinks!  This doesn't sound like a stable friend I'd want my husband to have.  Too many red flags for me!  Keep your eye on those two.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	Your husband + her = possible affair.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	well shes old and that is why but maybe shes a drinker not sure but i am sure this is just being stupid. there are some bitches out there like that. i am sure if you met her you would realize it also and i suggest you meet her and get acquainted nd like her i am sure shes not threat to your marriage and it should be know n that you are barking up the wrong tree.|`|81wvN8Rraa	I think he would have to stop hanging with her or he could get gone.|`|0d4X54rMaa	you told her first you were his wife  she was obviously trying to get a rise out of you which she did    keep an eye on that woman.. she sounds like trouble|`|AA10540570	depending on the ppl involved they have either been having an affair under your nose for YEARS, or  she was joking. or drunk...|`|b6356b9558163864dfaed163316ee3b1aa	You let him go out alone to bars with her.. without you ? Ask to meet her. Something doesn't sound right...|`|iJ8qPcL1aa	You should invite her over for a threesome.  Face it, your man is cheating.  We all cheat, its in our nature|`|gsg1zDZyaa	I think alot of this depends on if he has a history of infadelity.  I hate to say this because in theory you should trust your husband but realistically I think anyone would be taken off guard by this.  If he has always been faithful, trust him and move on but ask him to be respectful of your feelings and standpoint just as you will be of his from then on. Maybe even meeting the woman would help, especially if she is such a close friend of his.  If he hasnt always been faithful, I think some investigation would help to settle your nerves, just be careful not to step on any toes and be aware that this option could hold some serious consiquences if done sloppily.  Good luck.|`|ZVo2obCKaa	y havent you met her? i mean if your husband hangs out with her, why wouldnt he want to introduce her to his wife?      she sounds like a goofball to me. and i think your husband knows it. im not sure what's so engaging about her to want to keep in contact, but the easy way to solve this is for your husband to just bring you along next time they meet up. be nice, but make it clear that YOU are his wife.|`|IXqt303oaa	When you say older, how much older are we talking about? Is she someone his mother's age? Well, regardless of her age, you did the right thing. Whatever you do, STAY ON TOP OF THINGS! Don't let this lady disrespect you or your marriage. It's some trifling women out here, and make sure you keep your man in check too. Let him know you will not be disrespected. If I were you I would get a little more info on this "older lady". It's all about the R-E-S-P-E-C-T!
f23123a78f85512dc7f0c828923d32b0aa	oh girl hush. you know you're pretty :)|`|GQ8aKXr6aa	You look like.. like..I forget her name...    But you're definitely more than average..     Damn you look nice..     Like a 9.5    Oh why must you tease me like this? lol|`|PJ2198Slaa	youre ok.... i wouldnt be concerned.  your like a 7 out of 10
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Sounds good to me.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	That sounds really fun. I can see why some older people (or parents with young kids) might not be able to make it, but I'd definitely go to a midnight wedding!|`|HiSVA9p8aa	I think you are approaching this in a really mature fashion.  By saying that it's OK if people leave before the ceremony, you are basically giving people permission to come celebrate with you, and still showing respect for their lives and needs.    I wish you all the best for your wedding and your marriage.|`|VpCtXEMGaa	That sounds like my kind of wedding!! Good luck.|`|AaoclPYCaa	I think it sounds really nice.  Besides that is not really that late for most people especially if you do it on a weekend.  I would come.|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	it sounds nice    and relaxed|`|QclMchfGaa	that sounds great and it would seem to be really special to your partner. i would invite just really good friends and family if you don't want a really big wedding.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Sounds like fun but be prepared for the older members of the fam to bow out early.|`|mjyRcxUHaa	That sounds great, very original and special.  Only I would do it the opposite, I'd have the wedding at midnight then do a breakfast in the morning.  You could have Mexican Omelets, Mimosas (Orange juice and Champagne), etc. People want to celebrate you being married not party before you get married that's a shower/bachelor party. Most likely your guests will take a nap before they come.  Plus I bet the place that you get will be inexpensive.  Think about how nice at the end of the reception you and you guests can watch the sunrise as you start out your new life together as husband and wife. Good Luck!! Hope I helped!!|`|VOM75DoWaa	*giggles* sounds great! Novel in fact!! Mmmm why not get married in pajamas, then serve a breakfast!!   Have like a slumber party!!
Gkf0dWYdaa	ask her to dinner and maybe after...|`|At7WLduQaa	your trying to force her to be your friend, if you keep approaching her and it doesnt work, there is nothing you can do|`|uEU0PPjsaa	well you can ask her to eat lunch with you or just keep hanging w/ her in class till it turns in to a friendship..|`|JqIhy7Pvaa	If you really want to be her friend then ask yourself- How did I make the friends I already have- be nice to her and sonner or later you might have a new best freind
XbsuY1ogaa	I'd fall for it, as long as the movie/album was playing at some point.|`|6ad0f5a3a4041e74a28d21fd97b9a114aa	....WHAT?!?!|`|C72xMgl4aa	i hope that's sarcasm...or a joke.|`|0CvZ3gTwaa	wow suck my weiner, a better one and this always works is "nice shoes wanna f***?"|`|Hqyf7BQdaa	uhm no its   either      yiur hotter than donut grese       or my names not elmo but you can tickle me anytime baby!|`|fN23bHi0aa	U are a fckig dumb ***|`|j7o7RsZKaa	no|`|BWgV2xSZaa	Err...I dont get it...birds cry?|`|sLmX4H3Caa	No, no that was horrible. Don't ever say that again. Pick up lines are as dumb as the people who use them.|`|8oqurmE0aa	that is so god damn lame!
a20eb73abc00107965d3577c592c8492aa	Just ask her " hey how are you" and from then if conversation doesn't get going ask her how her day went.|`|KcYaPYhhaa	Just start off normally with "Hey what are you doin?"|`|NG4E7pbuaa	You have the right idea!  Keep it playful, innocent, light.  Although, do not over text her because it can be more detrimental than beneficial.  There is also nothing like face time to really gain the truth of her feelings for you!|`|XqAWm9Yjaa	have sex
rPT4J5YLaa	Try and just spend time with him alone not with him and his friends together, or try having a talk with your boyfriend and tell him how you are feeling and that you rather not spend time with his friends as long as they are mean to you. It is ok for him to spend time with them but not with you along because it makes you feel bad I'm sure he will understand. Guys and Girls need time with there friends so when he is with his friends plan something with yours.|`|CcIasKaRaa	If he loves you he should stick up for you. i would|`|QsoY8trZaa	Did you really just type "wif"?
xArlqHtraa	That is one of the sweetest stories I have ever heard. That's one lucky gal. :'D|`|mHFLFTVDaa	its so cuttee :) ?|`|erDvKGHCaa	Well I think that is a wonderful story. Very cute,romantic,and dreamy!|`|7DUYlTjdaa	im not a girl i want points. and i think its cool.
f8ON3dRfaa	First of all, dump the friend.    Then, ask yourself, would you really like guys who date people like her? If they eventually get around to dating her would probably mean that she's their type and you're not like her at all!    Find people who knows how to appreciate you for who you are, both friends and boyfriends.    And, my stand is, no, don't take her second-hand goods. Even if he chases you like mad, raise the standard bar and don't give in so easily!|`|z8WIAhDVaa	I have that same problem with my friend, she ALWAYS copies me, i now how that feels.  Go with your heart.  It is not a good idea to go out with your best friend's X.  But if you really like him, you have a great shot. Go with your heart and good luck.|`|1H56FPt8aa	ew no. Hes done with her and wants to move on to you. And when hes done there he will move on.       Find a better guy who sees the good in you.
916gtqBuaa	clearly youre not good friends and if you were liek sorta friends at the time she probly knew how you felt     go for it and leave the b****. youre better than that and you deserve it get the boy f*** the gal.
oThzxyzfaa	all right, this is going to be hard to hear, but forget him.  he knew you were friends right?  sounds like a player to me.  i doubt its worth the heartache that is going to be involved.  a month with someone he loved?  yeah, he doesn't have a clue.  save yourself the drama and move on|`|Fi8AIi4baa	He obviously trusts you, but not neccessarily /likes/ you.   Just talk to him more, and hope things work out. You learn more about people every time you talk to them.
a85CukoUaa	OMG you sound like me in the beggining of my 3 yr relationship with my best friend (who i am still with its going on 3 yrs and 7 months now) i was 16 when we first started going out and he was 18...him and i were always goofing around and making fun of eacother as friends but when things got serious where we were actually in a relationship...he kept acting the same....so what i did was i explained to him that we're no longer just best friends we're bf and gf and if we want things to work out for us we have to act like bf and gf more!! get more lovey dovey with him and kiss and hug be romanitc and see how he reacts call him pet names like baby or sweetheart and do things togrether rather than with other ppl around and you two should be fine it worked out for me great you'll see if he's ready to be in a relationship with you if he goes 100% for it or if he backs away so hopefully it will all work in your favor ;)|`|XhpLwjCuaa	You are 14 years old so you most likely rely on your parents for a lot. If you can't get out to something because of transportation or money you need to rely on what you have in common. your 14 years old and it may be really tough for you two but as long as there is no intense fighting keep it going.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	You are to young to be dating, to young to be in any relationship right now.  You should be working at being a good student, and a good friend for a few more years.  Ar 14 your body is not ready for sex. Have you thought about the consequences, STD's, AIDS, babies, diapers, angry parents and can the boy pay child support. I think you need to grow up more in mind and body before you get into relationships. Sex is  not a sport for you kids to play at. Have morals for goodness sake.|`|sipXnwifaa	Tell him that if you said losing him would be something you could handle you would be lying, that is a good way of telling him how much you care about him.  Then try to spice things up and be more cuddly and flirty with him.|`|bYU77eteaa	Hey...thats what happens in relationships...after the first year it settles down.  Do things afterschool together like study, clubs at school, exercise, volunteer...volunteering together is REALLY good.  Being very supportive of each other in highschool is important and when you get a little older, say 11th and 12th grade, you will understand what I mean.  You have to learn to do things with each other and rely on each other to get through...to where you need each other for real and then it's never "old" (when you get older you may buy a house together and a car...or work to go on vacation together...this is training to see if yall can hang tight)|`|yuwjQjKqaa	take it to the next......|`|Ak6HLE5oaa	HEY GURL..THE BEST THING TO DO IS SPEND SOME ALONE TIME TOGETHER! THE TWO OF YOU NEED TO JUST GO SEE A MOVIES BY YOURSELVES! AND HAVE FUN AND BE YOU AROUND HIM AND HE NEEDS TO BE HIMSELF AROUND YOU! IT WILL WORK BECAUSE THATS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND MY BOYFRIEND. OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS LIKE YOURS AT TIMES AND SO I SUGGESTED THAT I WANTED TO SEE A MOVIE AND HE TOOK ME. I WAS ABLE TO BE MYSELF AS WELL AS HE. EVER SINCE THEN, WE HAVE GONE TO THE MOVIES EVERY WEEKEND AND WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 2 YEARS ON THE 27TH OF THIS MONTH AND NOW WE ARE STRONGER THAN EVER!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	take it to the next level|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	you are already talking about it and now you hae decided to that you can't live with out him well you know what you have learned alot from him and now its time to let him go and seek someone else its good for both ofyou. i mean hey you may find somsone else that you can go with you will like as much or more life itsn't one person only till you marry and you could meet lots before that time comes so get moving. take care and good luck|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	i would talk about it. communication is the key. just try being more flirty, going out more, holding hands and doing boyfriend/girlfriend things. if it doesn't feel right, maybe it's just not meant to be. maybe you need to find someone else to see that you really WANT him and that will get you guys to get your spark back. see how the first few things go and if not, try dating other people for a while.|`|cb4436697a935c843c809ed2c03d5ccdaa	You are too young to get serious...   It most likely wont last if you do stay together for a while.  People change and grow apart the older we get.|`|AA10705401	Try doing new things with each other.....find out what he likes and make a date to do it with him or find a conversation he likes .....Like sports and talk about it with him. I hate to say it but you have your whole life ahead of you he is not going to be the only boy you go out with but i wish you lots of luck|`|JXIDPe4Aaa	it sounds like you need to take a break. you are really young for a long term relationship, though at the same time you're really lucky you have something like this. If you really wanna stick with him for the long haul, be prepared cause high school will not be easy.|`|P44Djhbdaa	Talk to him openly abt wat u mean to him, how u feel without him, how damn sh!t it will b if u break up and most importantly, talk to him even more than usual to get hold of his mind back to u.  Hope it helps lol|`|8NHCUPyaaa	Spend some time alone with him. Try to rekindle your relationship. Think about how you started liking eachother. Try to just relive that moment.|`|mlySj2ilaa	Just talk to him abot it. Maybe like go to the movies or watch a movie and like cuddle and kiss and hold hands. Do stuff best friends wouldnt do. Do stuff only boyfriend and girlfriend would do =]
nMzC1qZTaa	You need to show her you're not the guy she broke up with. That you've changed and will not do whatever it was that caused the breakup this time around. Be the guy she fell in love with. KEEP being that guy.    Rewind in your head to the first time you guys were together and figure out why it didn't work out too. Fix that. You'll be very prepared to get her back and seeing the change she should be more willing to take you back.|`|Y8MakQ2laa	Here is the secret...    Women are attracted to guys who are emotionally strong, confident and indpendent.    I totally understand if you're feeling anxious to get her back, but if you act too needy, desperate or pushy, you're going to kill your chances of a reunion.    Why?    Because when you act too needy or desperate, you appear weak and insecure... which is a major turn-off to most girls.    You need allow her to reconnect with the original positive energy that attracted her to you when she first met you.  I bet when you guys first started dating that you acted pretty confident and strong right?  But ask yourself how you are acting now.  Are you coming across as desperate?  If she knows she can have you back whenever she wants, she won't be motivated to get back together with you any time soon.    Getting an ex girlfriend back is not that hard, but if you don't know how to work with her natural instincts then you'll only end up with more frustration and pain.  I posted a link to an excellent blog that covers EXACTLY what you need to do and say to win your ex girlfriend back as quickly as possible.    I hope this helps.  Stay strong and I wish you the best!    Matt|`|IyfLPrJHaa	ATTRACT? Its more than attraction much more, you need to show her you are the NEW improved man since she was with her because you were not perfect thats why you all broke up. If you seem like you have the same issues or are the same guy she was with that broke her heart too no she wont be attracted to that. be a friend to her girls love this

Definitely date her.- I just like the way she did her hair.    2. Definitely kiss her.- She's got very pleasant and soft facial features that is really a big turn on. Don't like the way she "flattened" her hair, but that doesn't matter due to how naturally beautiful she is.    3. Definitely date her.- I'm usually more into blondes but she definitely has some pretty facial features that makes her look very feminine and girly. The curls on her hair gives her a hot messy "I don't care what I look" type of look.    4. Probably dump her.- Just how masculine she looks is a turn off. She looks very close to a guy with how short her hair is so it's hard to be attracted to her looking so similar to a man.|`|xP1HJnSbaa	1. date  2. kiss  3. date (demi looks ugly in that picture but still date)  4. dump|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	kiss  2&3, date 1, dump 4.|`|hW5F2v2Taa	I need to take a dump

The worst thing to do is to treat this like it's just a peace of nothing...  Because that will piss her off and she will try to get everything out of you if she can.Especially if she finds out it was with her old best friend.  Don't blame it on her and say it's because she's being b!tchy, simply bring it up as it is and tell her what you did. Don't deni it, that only makes the situation more sticky.|`|NC9FV8bLaa	You better hurry up and leave before she catches you with her ex best friend, or she will get all of your crap and then some.

Ok...|`|3YmVHinRaa	i dont know but at leaast take ur **** and leave|`|jkDawQVNaa	you scum bag, why didnt u just tell your wife to her face how ya felt|`|W2RaqfWOaa	If she finds out you are cheating and she has a good lawyer she can get more then half.

Don't you know that the cheating has completely ruined your marriage? So are you saying it's ok to cheat. What difference does it make whether you get to keep anything or not? You did worse than her.|`|KhdkXEPGaa	you should have married your preference in body build for one & two your not completely wrong i am a woman & i kn how it feels to have a bliss relationship & soon as the wedding vows are said the other half changes into there true self its messed up really it leaves you in that kind of position........ but if you can prove  that she is @ fault in why the marriage can not work you will come out of it o.k you will need evidence & a good lawyer ......i sure do understand y you are doing what your doing though...sorry you got tricked too|`|iJ8qPcL1aa	LOL  You'll be lucky if its only half|`|LTK1Qtqfaa	first and foremost your biggest mistakes you made was (1) you started dating her ex- best friend (2) your bragging about it, dangerous thing to do,and you might not want to hear this but this is your wife and no matter what you took those vows for better or for worse, and I always wondered why we love each other to death when things are going good but as soon as the bad hits we want to leave, and when we leave we like to talk trash, if it was something i was to tell you it's check  yourself before you wreck yourself, and no bra size is worth the pain of hurting someone,and after a while do you think this is going to be the one are when it hits the fan she'll be a bitchy worthless control freak to?
Cb5N6UaQaa	You should invite them.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	I think it is smart. I didn't have a boy-girl party when I was 14. In fact, I didn't have a boy-girl party until I was 18. Mixing the two can be quite a pain. It should be a girls party.|`|WmM3XeLPaa	Yes, it is perfectly fine not to have a Guy-Girl party. You could hold one later in the month if you'd like with guys and girls, too. They need to act themselves, but when girls are around boys, they tend to get a little wacko, if you know what I'm saying. If anyone complains, then tell them straight out that you don't need just boys to come to your party to make it a party. Make a music video or something. If they get too fed up, talk to your parents. Parents always know best. It's perfectly fine. Remember, it is YOUR birthday party, not your friends.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  Be confident. Partay like no other! Woot woot!|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	guys will think you're a lesbian|`|4drQ38qZaa	Yeah it is totally fine. I never had a boy and girl party since this year and so yeah. It is your part and you should do what you want to do.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Yes ~ I think its good that you girls have your party with out us boys! B-day party's with girls and boys sometimes get out of.....|`|jXndHFm3aa	Of course it's your party they don't like your party to bad it's yours and they chose to come|`|DPi4bTnuaa	I so feel you, boys always ruin things! You should stay with your girlfriends..if they have a problem with it. They can leave...simple as pie.|`|nlQyTrLhaa	Well ya. And it's YOUR party, why would you care what others think? Do what you want.|`|tegyqU6Raa	No that is totally normal. I did not start inviting guy until my 16th. Don't worry you will know when to invite guys.|`|sYD3CNfZaa	it willl be more funner with guys(:|`|e8BgKv8caa	yea thats totally ok. u dont have 2 b around boys all the time, and if ur friends ask u why there rnt any boys, just tell them that you wanted some girl time.|`|AA10395956	Only invite boys that wouldn't ruin the party if you want to. But it's your party, you can invite boys if you really want to, if you don't then just don't. Many parties that girls have includes boys, but that doesn't mean you have to. So don't, unless you know some boys that can behave maturely around girls.|`|vKctajqiaa	well its your birthday and if there are no guys there people could think that your playing hard to get or the guys will think it will be something like a girls sleepover. With them thinking about this gossip will spread and your popularity will be boosted|`|4AUF0Znhaa	Sure it is. If you don't want to have guys, don't have guys. No one cares. It's your party and you should party how you want to.  Happy Birthday!  Best of luck=]|`|tr5lG02Xaa	its k. as long as i come|`|aQwON4nYaa	hell yea it doesn't matter what you do its your party!|`|FD8r3vHJaa	YES!!! have an all girls party, it will be fun, you and your friends will be able to relax and be urselves....|`|nsIy1zfkaa	yes, but if you dont want one, dot be pressured to have one, its ur b day, ur choice :)|`|UQT37xS1aa	it doesn't matter. It's your party, who cares! I mean, sure, guys are fun to have around and all, but sometimes you just wanna hang out with girls so the guys won't tease you. It'd be more relaxing, so it's okay!    And tons of people do that.|`|bjQcSvKXaa	of course.

Do it as nicely as you can which will show that person that you have more strength of mind and thought.    "We've been buddies'friends for a while, however, I can't help myself but be truthful with you. I really do not want to be related to you in any way."    You could say something like this.|`|aBqJhdufaa	Since you're in hell, just to torture you, you wouldn't be able to tell them! :P|`|j7o7RsZKaa	tell them to go to hell|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	The DMV|`|vwoqIUR6aa	go to hell|`|p7BjjPtNaa	Go to Detroit.|`|9vzfI4kDaa	really piss them off and tell them to go to heaven or for a swim,lol|`|xveY9Pc3aa	haha|`|AATmqYQ1aa	Go to earth...earth is hell to me.|`|g39i8bJ1aa	earth because thats the living hell|`|SbRju5wYaa	You tell them to go to the DMV.|`|AA11644166	wow...what a paradox. how long did it take you to think of that one?|`|lM7xPQg0aa	well maybe we all are in hell and don't know it think about it.  so, you still would say ahhh go to hell
bq98xZjcaa	no it wouldnt be wierd.  take it from me the same thing happened to me.  i barely knew this boy in my english class exsisted   until one day he IMed me and we talked for hours  he asked me for my number  and some days later he asked if i wanted to hangout or go to the movie  i thought it was really sweet   and i fell in love.|`|AbSizeNBaa	do it|`|qWrRLab3aa	If you like her ask her out. She sounds interested in you, and wants you to make a move.|`|89LlKbm6aa	it wouldnt be weird. seems like she likes you|`|qCU2mJ2Caa	do what you feel honey! ;) if she was up talking to you for that long, then definitley she likes you. she likes your company and dosent feel shy around you because you make her feel different. garuentee she'll say yes if you ask her out. >:]|`|alxuJVsCaa	Ask her. It's better to find out now than later, because she can just change her mind.|`|BTEUx4a4aa	yes she likes you!!  im a girll to haa and i definitely would never stay up till 2 AM unless the guy on the other line was interesting, you obviously had too much to talk about since you were on the phone so long and the conversation was so perfect that she didnt even want to end it  you should definitely see if she wants to  hang out whenever you see at school or somethingg ask her if she wants to go to the movie and then say wats your number so i can set it up and call her the next day  hope this helps!!!  =]]|`|dxPIPCESaa	spit the best game eva 2 her and hope she likes u !|`|WANEYn5Xaa	nope.. i think she likes you  the only reason i would be up til two would be to cram for a test or talk to my crush   so go ahead and ask|`|DCHvyqOGaa	Ya just say like, "Well there are some good movies out and i was wondering if you wanted to go with me this weekend?"|`|bec77fe70053715a66b5fd7e555ab863aa	thats cute :)  go for it! it will work out just dont be a jerk at any time, even in front of your friends.    i love questions like these, dont know why.    -good luck =]|`|ppuqLBMBaa	sorry if it burts your bubble but girls stay up til 2 talking on AIM or texting or w.e...its kinda natural..  but totally get her number and ask her  it might be a good way to become closer and if you are nervous do it over the computer again..she probably wont mind that...good luck to you
9LLKBKOmaa	Take some time to yourself like a week or so of doing things that you enjoy, try not to talk to either of them during that week. Then when you feel less stressed you may be able to make a more conscious decision.|`|XsVHrccCaa	wow 8 years  anyways if u feel a connection with that other person u should tell them   it is really confusing though espcially if u dont know how he feels about you but if u havent already try to get to kno him maybe he'll tell u how he feels  i feel the same way about this guy who i really like    hope this helped|`|I2amoo6Kaa	go for the guy who u feel connected with|`|yuwjQjKqaa	and you want us to do what?|`|savPsYWjaa	Livejournal.com?|`|tO8ey3o8aa	live life for urself for a while|`|HCWkdk4naa	after 8 years you should have gotten married.  sounds like both of you had long standing commitment issues.  take a break from men for a while until you know what you want.|`|eX8i4vwRaa	heres a hug :)|`|l1iCPVPOaa	yeah well i have been out this whole week being sick, and my teacher is giving me a referral because he thinks im playing "hooky" which he announced to the whole class.|`|XsYrhdY2aa	I think you need a cyber kiss MMMMUUAAAAHHHH!!!!|`|q7I1Ek3kaa	"livejournal.com" lmfaooooooooooooooooooooooooooo    you'll be fine..life has its sucky times...what u gonna do!!!!!!!!     writing really does help tho|`|ukTR7KNSaa	I'm sorry you're having a hard time.|`|KM6PDz5qaa	Awwwhs, cheer up, ill buy you a drink [;|`|XbsuY1ogaa	Get some ice cream.

Nobody can help you at this point, you just have to keep on trucking.|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	single is good.. but what was the question?|`|cfqoNK8raa	Everything happens for a reason. Get a gallon of ice cream and a movie and just let yourself mope for a while and then think things out.     Hope I helped!      bridget.|`|HGdQp8QBaa	you should go with the guy you like, you deserve it after being heart broken!!|`|nsIy1zfkaa	Talk to the person you feel connected to.

2TC7aS8Baa	well she could have been having problems  she was still have asleep when she was getting dress i mean its happens   she wasnt paying attention|`|0fabfcfbe06b34a491d903e768e1f239aa	maybe she was making a statement
o95szcI0aa	Smart, outgoing, pretty eyes, skinny, cute face, not-slutty, nice, and couldn't give a sh*t about being cool or "popular"
UaIR316oaa	i think shes still hurt by the fact that you didnt use to like her "shes a girl we know these things" she doesnt know where to go from here. Does she know you like her now? Ask her out . if she says yes then great if not well you two are friends...if youre not friends cause you asked her out then you never really were, friends dont let stuff like that get in the way
VXcnq3zGaa	It's not easy just meeting people at random in pubs and clubs for most people. Try other ways of meeting people. A good way would be to join a book club or something like that! And if all else fails, try a dating website. There are some free ones out there somewhere!    Good luck!|`|OFCCgLdKaa	I have the same problem but I'm younger. You know the trick? Alcohol.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	Eaaassy question. But its a long answer. i guess the best advice is and im 30 and recently single but ive been working on my game for a loooooooooooooong time, is just be funny, and look like you are having fun and dress nice. If you are going out, then especially be funny. Alot of time at the bar people really dont have anything to talk about, so if you come over and have a couple of "friends (like the tv show)" storys to tell that are funny then you will draw the crowd in. Ladies like crowd pleasers and funny guys. Have a friend you to hang out with you.    My only other advice is what ladies hate. Dont have that face on you about "i want to have sex with you tonight" and dont seem desperate. She starts scooting away, just move on. There are plenty girls out there who feel like you. Its just women are way more picky than men usually.|`|mtIEsgzfaa	I am 29 and I feel the same way. I don't know how to read guys if they come up and talk to me and smile etc. I assume they don't like me in that way and I end up losing out on potential bf's and friends.    the best thing you can do is say hello and smile and wave. This guy has my attention but I am too chicken to do anything about it.|`|qCU2mJ2Caa	no!!!!! alchol dosent solve anything. if you walk up to a girl with beer breath and drunk.. its the BIGGEST TURN OFF!!! i find shy guys cute. ;) not every pretty girl is single. there are some pretty girls that look like sluts.. dont bother with them because they usually want a guy who's muscular and proud and up himself. and a player. dont think too much when you try to approach a girl. be yourself and just talk casually with them like your talking to a friend of yours. introduce yourself first and if shes free ask her if she want to go out for dinner. things should flow from there is she says yes. its not the end of the world if she says shes already got a boyfriend. and you never know one day a girl might approach you instead. >:]|`|vjmXiIfnaa	I agree with Kid B. You need to put yourself in situations that will offer opportunities to ignite conversations. The book club is a great idea. You could also join a league (kickball, baseball, volleyball, etc).     It will not hurt anyone if you approach another being. You may get rejected by others, but so what? There are billions of people on the planet, dwelling on the lack of compatibility with one is not very coherent.
ScEG7QEjaa	Kaila sounds really pretty.    By the way:  Kaila is hebrew, and it means Laurel-Crowned   Kirsten is Scandinavian and means Christ-Bearer     Just FYI :D    Good luck!

vjmXiIfnaa	I agree, you need to be yourself.    When one smiles, laughs, and are agreeable/empathetic-a person will fall a little more in lust with another person. It makes them approachable.|`|5x57b46Qaa	ok ok ok im a dude. i had this gf and she texted me constantly and it really anoyed me. so dont text him to much make him txt you thats wat i learned. and if he flirts with other gurls like i do he probally isnt in for a real long relationship...so watch out for that. good luck lol whats better advice if not from a guy? lol|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Honestly, just be yourself.  If you work too hard to be someone you're not (ie flirty or "not lame" as you call it) he will end up either moving on (because you're not who he thought you were) or he'll dump you later on when the charade is up.      Best tip = be yourself.|`|H1UzYl8haa	.wear seductive clothes  .get some makeovers goin on  .have an adorable laugh  .smile alot around him  .text him  .hug him from behind  .hold hands jokingly  .jump in his arms for fun  .borrow his jacket  .lock arms wl him and call him babe  guud luck sweatie
seMpUL8Kaa	Yeah I get that way a lot myself. He is not choosing fun over you, he just has a life and you have to learn that he needs to live it. I understand you though, I feel sometimes like my boyfriend would rather go out and have fun, but little old me holds him back and he doesn't get to have the fun despite me wanting him to have it. He reassures me that he has more fun staying in with me, but I find it hard to believe. Don't take it out on him that he wants to go out. Just because he is not with you does not mean that he would prefer to do that than be with you. It's just his time with his mates, every couple needs that for a healthy relationship.  If you find it hard to change that way of thinking, just think about it in his shoes, you hang out with your friends right? You have fun don't you?.. but it's two different kinds of fun with your friends and with your boyfriend...neither is a substitute for the other.  I guess you wont completely snap out of it, but you will learn to loosen the leash.|`|TX0LiKBraa	I feel the same way with my boyfriend sometimes.  So when he goes out, I get a group of friends together and go do something too!  Hope that helps!  Good luck!    And... I'm sure he's thinking about you the whole time.  Wishing you were there.  ;-)|`|f8ON3dRfaa	While he's out having his fun, make a shopping date with your girlies for some fun too!     I feel that girls who are possessive (myself included) do not really have a life of their own until the boyfriend comes along. So when the boyfriend is out, we're all back to our lonely caves, having nothing to do but to sit around and wait for him to finish his fun and come back.    As cheesy as it seems, getting out of the comfort zone (your home) does wonders. Even if it means taking a brisk walk to the 7-11.|`|9b7b6a295fcf6719be11cc7dbad52abfaa	Hey girl,  Just dump him and put me on your favorites and I will chat with you! Deal or no Deal??|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	Just remember that you are your own person. You went and do things before you met him.  Don't be dependent on him for your happiness.  If there is complete trust then you should be free from worries.  There should be a freedom in the relationship.  Time away will make it better when you do get together.
xrswVJL8aa	To me he sounds wayy too much like a player, what if he promised the same things he promised you to his earlier gf? but then what if he truly does like you more than her? if he did truly like you he would have broken up with her but maybe he doesnt want to hurt her. there are always two opinions, so i say listen to yourself and listen to what you think is right, listen to not only your heart but also your brain. =).i know this wasnt much of a help but i tried... =) good luck i hope u find the one if you havent already.|`|rd5468H1aa	You just said he's a player... the best bet would be to just move on or he may end up hurting you.
LuPKIEmdaa	It's not illegal to be "mean".  Sometimes you just have to deal with mean people.    If he is abusing you (inappropriate touching, physical/emotional abuse), you deserve better.  Best talk to mom first, and if she is indifferent, tell someone at school.    Hopefully, if they fight all the time, the relationship won't last.  If you feel you or someone else is in danger though, you must tell someone (but don't lie, that will just make things worse for you - be honest).|`|1hciyvKdaa	Envision if your dad was saying and doing what this guy is, and if it believable now that this guy is saying what dad might say, hes an adult and you need to respect him. Taking advantage of the, hes not my real dad is pretty weak. So make sure you are considering what is and what is not a real unfair situation. Most kids are hoping to do as they please, and sorry life it just not that way. Yes some step parents want nothing really to do wtih the kids and are not nice to them, if this is the case, tell mom, sit her down, put your arms around her, give her a hug, and start tellign her realistic problems your experiencing and how much they hurt you. If he yelled at you for not doing your homework, thats not one to bring up, chores not done, not applicable either. Got told to get off the phone, sorry not this one either.  Cursing at you, hitting you, threats that hes might of said, demoarlizing you in the way he speaks to you, these are the kinds of things to slowly, softly, and clearly to discuss with mom. If she backs off and stops you dead in your tracks and does not want to hear it, call dad ask him, call your grandparents on either side of the family and discuss this. Be as adult as you can. Mom has decided for now she is ok with the fighting or she would of packed you all up and left, you most likely cant change that. I hope that something I mentioned is pertinant and has some value to your situation. Im sorry, this story is so true in lots of step parent relationships. Im sorry hun, I hope things improve. As soon as you can get a job, get out and be out of the house as much as you can working. Get involved in clubs at school, go to the library, do volunteer work somewhere age appropriate so that you may have more quality of life time for yourself. You deserve it.|`|ivbnPxSKaa	tell ur mom he "touched you" or threatened u|`|XWk7TDYTaa	UNLEASH HELL ON HIM  yup...no one should have to deal with stuff like that.    get mean, dont let him push you around.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	unleash hell on him  tell him he needs to **** off  and stop being an immature asshole!    i honestly would do that! :D|`|maCpSMGqaa	Call Social Services on both of them.

Have you talked to your mom about all of this? If you have and she still doesn't listen then maybe she just doesn't know how to get out of this and she might need some professional help. You should talk her into getting some family therapy and you should go along with her.|`|Hx2raTNQaa	wwell you should talk to your mom about how you feel then you can  tlk to ur school counselor:)

Appearance isnt everything but alot of realasionships are based on this.     Girls that are not blessed with beauty, get boys they have crushes on to be their friends first, so the boy may get attracted to their personaility, but beatuy is in the eye of the beholder, which means each boy wil have his own meaning of what he likes.    Im not sterotypical but heres what some stero-types of boys like:    Sporty Boys/Jocks :  Cheerleaders, "hot" or "popular" girls, but if the boy is sensitive he could like anyone. Some also like girls tht do sports aswell, but are not too boyish.    Confident boys:   Like a confident girl, or a shy one. it depends.  If ur shy:  Ur lucky tht he'sconfident, if you know he likes you play hard to get . ALOT. he will follow you!  If ur confident:  Boys are like elastic bands, when they are streched away from you , let them stay like that for a while, and they will BOUNCE back =]     Shy boys:  They are the easiest to handle , but be sensitive and open with them           p.s.    wear what you feel comfortable in , but here are some tips....  If you would love straight hair , straighten it.  If you would like to have more clear skin - wash it and drink alot of water, and eat healthly.   If you would like to change anything about ur personaility- DONT!!!

Thats about it.|`|c8N4fS6aaa	I would probally say ur hair and makeup if it is to much makeup we think u are ugly because we can't see the real u.|`|G5Cgtrowaa	I like girls who look athletic and aren't too skinny (athletic = not fat either).  I think confidence is the biggest attraction. I also like long brown hair most.|`|li9WGkzLaa	I am a guy all the my name on here isn't i look for:  mid size booty  very little flab  being polite  obviously good looks  the girl not being shy  someone who doesn't cheat  Not a skank but a girl who doesn't wear a turtle neck everyday   style   i like graphic T's on a girl  i also like a girl who wears skinny jeans good luck|`|h9xKfbVKaa	guys like body and personality, We obviously are first attracted to their body becuz thats the first thing we see  But it does not mean thats all we care about!! I like my gilfriend to just care but not over care. Alot of girls are just wicked creepy when they want tlo know what you do every second of the day. for kissing just let it flow,dont over do it and like SHOVE your tongue down your parteners throat.lol     hope this helps and is best answer material!  :)
Cb5N6UaQaa	This things happen. Try to find someone that likes you be more approachable. Join a team or organization. Try to not be negative about stuff. That helps.|`|3kNeWYvdaa	Don't worry about it! If your still young u will make time for it someday! Don't change who you are just be friendly and you'll find someone better than that guy. Don't get frustrated (though they do get on my nerves sometimes)!|`|652c9c4ac00397e3d3a672481ae4771baa	Either become a mindless ****,  or look for better guys.

Try to find what boys you like can relate to. Be pleasant. Be consistent. I don't know what else to say, there's no secret answer to it. Also, be patient. Everyone gets their chance. Keep looking out for the right person, if you sit on your *** it'll be a lot harder. Good luck.|`|KcYaPYhhaa	I know how you feel I used to feel the exact same way and the same thing happened to me. But, I just recently found a guy who likes me and just me. And remember there is someone out there for everybody. Most of the time, THOUSANDS of someones. I know it may not feel like that right now, but you have to believe in yourself and be positive. Someone is out there waiting for you. Trust me. And you will find him sooner than you think. good luck and I'm sorry this happened to you.|`|yVzBFIWvaa	I'm sorry that happened to you. That stinks. And guys only don't like you as far as you know. As I'm sure your crush didn't know you liked him, I'm sure there are guys that you don't know that like you. Don't worry about it too much, don't be reliant on needing a boy around to keep you happy. Try to be more independent, and I know someday you'll find somebody. Don't worry. Good luck with everything. I don't know how much good it will do you, but here's a song that always cheers me up. It's called "Lucky Today" by Cloud Cult.|`|rHTsKg3kaa	guys are jerks|`|OyBuEpOTaa	It's ok .    You didn't include a pic or your age. You don't need to spend a lot to have a make-over. Try something new. If your hair is long try wearing it up. maybe you could go to a hair dresser and ask what they suggest.    Maybe you should be a little mysterious. Don't talk about your likes and dislikes, where you are going or doing.  Also you could take a class after school, like dance or kung fu or tai chi. This will help you to meet guys that don't go to your school.|`|zupacfZTaa	Worrying that no one likes you is a turn off in itself. Forget it and the right guy will find you.  Just be patient!    Follow love and love will flee.  Flee and love will follow thee.|`|3jWaexYOaa	you shouldn't please anyone if it mean changing yourself ... cuz wen the right guy comes along he'll like you for who 'REALLI' u r, and don't try to act a girly or change yourself cuz then that is juss being fake & some times people will call u out 4 that.

The one for you will come. It may take a while.  You shouldn't feel so pressured to date.  Honestly, single people live much happier lives anyways.  Enjoy that.  You don't need to worry about your boyfriend being mad at you or concerned because you 'flirted' with another guy and all that jazz.    He will come hun.   Just wait.   Patience is a hard thing to rely on I know, but to be happy and satisfied with the relationship, you have to.|`|XsYrhdY2aa	keep on keeping on|`|FTZ8kQ9Qaa	it is okay...dont worry...those stupid imature dudes will mature later...it gets better.
F0XEKHyVaa	That's a good age for a guy, but a girl should wait until she gets married.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	the question you really should be asking is " is 15 or 16 a good age to have an STD and a child?"|`|j7o7RsZKaa	Ever seen the Secret Life of the American teenager???|`|Fi8AIi4baa	I personally think it's too early, but I've grown up in a household of generally conservative parents, at least in that respect.|`|9c2dac91545a93248f3b50c9ac2fae3faa	No, its too early.|`|0VqNMJQFaa	Well, before having sex, ask yourself the following:    1. Do I want to have the reputation of sleeping with a guy just because he shows "loyalty" and "caring"?  If yes, proceed to the next question. If no, cease all sexual activity.    2. Do I want to risk getting pregnant, and having to go through high school, college, starting a career, renting/buying an apartment/house, and all stages of life that are easier without a child?  If yes, proceed to the next question. If no, cease all sexual activity.    3. Do I want to risk getting an STD, which ultimately means I could be risking my life?  If yes, proceed to the next question. If no, cease all sexual activity.    4. Do I want a relationship based on physical attraction or on chemistry?  If physical attraction, proceed to the next question. If chemistry, cease all sexual activity.    5. Am I willing to give away my virginity, the one thing that truly and completely belongs to me and will only belong to me ONCE, to a guy that I am not married to?  If yes, proceed to having sex. If no, cease all sexual activity.    My point is that as a teenager, and even an adult in your early twenties, premarital sex is not an especially bad idea. Premarital sex is NEVER a good idea.. but at any age younger than 25, you do not have the sexual maturity to realize what you're risking and what you're giving away by having sex.    Make wise choices.|`|da2KJ9fXaa	yeah why not, if you want to end up pregnant and throw your life away then go right ahead.|`|8oqurmE0aa	No, no guy at that age is loyal to any girl at all.|`|Ddd8LDPGaa	any age is good as long that you are safe|`|qCU2mJ2Caa	umm.. NO!!!!!!!!!!! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKCKING MIND!! thats why theres a certain age limit for you to have sex. 18???? that way if you do get pregnant you wouldnt have a desperate meltdown.|`|R4wEzQZ2aa	if you want a teen pregnancy|`|65lTdKNgaa	i was 16 so go for it - its fun|`|cfHzBMlBaa	School Teachers find that age as a good one for them to prey upon...|`|T3d4iXGFaa	Ummm ... no.  Little dear, why?  Why do you want to start so early concentrate on your studies, there will be time enough for that in the future.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	No.  At 15 or 16, are you ready to have a baby?  Are you responsible enough to say, "Hey, Mom, I need to get on the pill"?  Are you okay with saying, "You need to wear a condom no matter what"?    And besides, a 15 or 16 year old guy is probably more interested in having sex than being loyal and caring, lol.|`|AA10938466	No , you probably should wait for a guy who will be with you for a long time.Not some school boy just trying to get into your pants.
448z7bSPaa	o **** well is he better looking than u??? n do u like her or u just wanna help as a friend...    if u like her just let her kno hes a complete *** and u dont think she should be with hym|`|IwrS9zw1aa	just plop buddy! plopping is the key
7g8UHUJgaa	he could be going through something personal right now and cannot return any of your messages.    guys are wierd.    do not let him bug you because he is not returning messages.    he might think of you as a co-worker adn that is all?  it might not be what you want to hear but that is what it sounds like also.        ?????? again guys are wierd...like thes question marks here. lol|`|0fabfcfbe06b34a491d903e768e1f239aa	maybe he thinks that your just friends, or he was busy with someone else? because if you don't tell someone how you feel? then they think your not interested.  Good luck
GyENXDKNaa	Talk to him any time you get a chance, in the halls, anything!  Try to get to know him.  Once you become friends with him for a while, try to ask him out.  But don't ask him out when he is hanging out with his friends, he might get embarrassed.  (not that you would be embarrassing to him) but he might feel weird answering it around his friends (i would).
Mj0BA4Yvaa	Show him your bewbs!  Works every time.|`|MJ1kaIlkaa	whats wivv all the "liek's"   and its like !|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Go for it!!!|`|PqOThwVIaa	like yea like omg u like should like totally like ask him like out    like oh my like gosh|`|opZTyykPaa	flirt with him, wait for him to ask you
zzaScg0haa	It could work because a lot of the things you mentioned are superficial, you didn't really mention interests or things that actually matter
vjmXiIfnaa	It's not just college movies, it's ALL movies, shows, and books. Even cartoons have sexual innuendos in this day's society. Even the Bible has sexual content.|`|cxVmq2kraa	Because there is NOTHING entertaning about watching someone study.      It's simple.|`|ddWyRjmVaa	thats what people wanna see.  :P  lol|`|yLUqNgqsaa	It's because no one wants to see a movie about studying and doing homework, it's just boring. High school kids like to think that college will be all about fun and crazy parties when in reality, it's a small part of the college experience.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	To lure kids into college..|`|BL9CQgcAaa	who pay the money to watch college movies without that and pplz make movies to earn money, man are u retarded or somethin?
yGteqZoCaa	Well, considering we don't know how old you guys are, I still say a good ole party is always the answer to getting know someone at any age.  Have a sleep over, just the girls and do fun things that she can join into as well.  I think she just needs to keep herself busy 'cause she doesn't know what else to do.  Maybe, just maybe you will see a wild side of her, and she may even surprise herself.  Be creative, be funny, be silly, laugh, giggle, and maybe even smile, she will eventually cave and give in and join in too.  So just give her a chance to fit in and discover herself and maybe learn something new about yourself as well and just enjoy everyones company and friendship.  Good luck.|`|y6v4ztM8aa	you three should get drunk a lil. or go to a party and hopefully she'll hook up with someone. drinkngs the best choice i think but make sure she doesnt drink like alot|`|eDAX46b9aa	Wow, take your friend out to be more outgoing. make her have fun and party so that she realizes what she is missing when she isn't hanging with you. If she just wants to hang at the library, organize a study group and the rest of your crew to keep her company. (make sure it's okay with her) Ask her, "Whens the last time you've gone to a party?" and when she answers/doesn't, say, "I'm going to Sarah's party Saturday, and I'm sure she'd like you to come!" I bet your friend is secretly dying to go to the mall w/ you guys sometime soon, but she has to keep up with her studies. Make sure she knows that she can have fun and still get good grades.|`|0fabfcfbe06b34a491d903e768e1f239aa	It sounds like you both need some space for now, she is just trying to find herself... But let her know that you willalways be there for her.....|`|2TC7aS8Baa	well convince her to hang out with you guys  try doing things she would like to do other than studying   tell her to take a break and to have fun   you only live once|`|lc9nus8taa	just tell her she doesnt have to work ALL the time its good for your brain to have a break lol
XbsuY1ogaa	Honestly, I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness, and it sucked. Tell her if she wants you to not see him, she'll have to disassociate you (they're big on trying to avoid that).  Tell her you're not "spoiling useful habits" or anything like that. Throw "love" in the conversation. If she wasn't a Jehovah's Witness all her life (unlikely), she might know what it's like to love someone and have people pushing against her.  Or sneak around behind her back and meet in private. Are his parents' Jehovah's Witnesses? I'm sure they'll understand their son's romance. Have him talk to them and ask them not to tell if he thinks they'd agree to it. Maybe you can go to their house to see him. Or join a club or group together, or separately, and just not go so you can be together.    I am so sorry, I know what it's like. Good luck!|`|IK925thzaa	Call him on the phone. Sneak out at night. Call him to pick you up at school.|`|aBWT7SbMaa	so they caught u guys making out?  well just make out secretly obviosuly, i dont know the techinicalities and the rules to jevovah witness thing. but yeah go make out secretly, its a really simple problem|`|x66TTEymaa	well can't you sneek out or something,|`|edq4QzCMaa	well you might not make out  with  him again, but spend some quality time with him.    or tell youre grandma you can make your own decsicions      wait if you mean making out as in sex, everything i just said... i take it back|`|aoEuzU2Yaa	well sneak out.. but that most likely won't work. Do you go to the same school?? or you could say you are going to hang out with some of your friends at the movies and meet him there. Although, sometimes it is best just to be honest. Sometimes trying to go around things ends up worse than they were to begin with.|`|li9WGkzLaa	I am 14 my parents aren't real strict but to see him again if your grandma is really religous just seriously walk up to her and ask her for her forgiveness and promise her you will never do it again (DO NOT GET CAUGHT) and ask for her permission to see him again|`|taI3Oactaa	well dat iz ur fot 4 making out wit him but i guess u r n luv so all i can say iz talk 2 ur grandma.|`|K8uYKj06aa	Tell your grandma that you respect her beliefs but don't believe in them and all you're doing is making out and that you won't let it go any farther than that. Ask her if she would be ok with meeting your boyfriend and approving of him.      Hope this helps.|`|AA10934463	i kno what its like to have a Jehovah's witness as parent's and people i look up  to ...i dont think what you did is wrong but in that religion  its looked bad against when your that age . you should try to tel your  grandma that your sorry and that you didnt mean it . and maybe ask her to come with you on your dates like a shaperon  i usedto have a best friend whos boyfriend and her were Jehovahs Witnesses and i too aswell we used to go to his house all the time and they used tomake out in his bedroom none ever found out ;) . making out isnt a bad thing if thats all you do  anything past that well youllhave to endure what happends when your grandma finds out ...good luck|`|COmp4sIuaa	Sex? Haha, you're a tad young, no?|`|ZYUpEdcqaa	Okay, I am 15.  I get it, and I think they are being way too strict.  If you have a brain (not being mean)  just sneak it.  Say you want to go shopping, and go do something with him.  If you really like him, it will be worth it, and I am Lutheran by the way and I am abstinant.  I won't have sex until marriage.  I know where you are coming from  with all the religion stuff.  Everyone at my church kind of bugs me about those kind of things.  I mean, I guess you could listen and be miserable, but I think that is ridiculous because I don't think the Bible says anything about not making out.  Good luck!|`|Gkf0dWYdaa	um....kill them ....duh|`|W4Dek41Jaa	You shouldn't have made out with him where your grandmother could see.  Lol, be SNEAKY.  And if you want to see him again you could be like, ' I'm going to the movies with my friends ' and go, with them, but also meet your boyfriend then you could sneak off to a movie with him and your friends could go see another movie.  Also you could say your going to do that again, and like go to a restaurant with your boyfriend or something.  And so your grandmother doesn't get suspicious you could have your friends back up your whereabouts.       Good luck, I hope you get to see him again! :)     Um yea now, that I'm reading all the comments if your having sex at 13 that's totally not appropriate.  And yea alone with a 15 year old?  Your grandmother has a good point, just listen to her.  Because once you do something like that, you can't take it back.   I hope you understand.|`|xHcQSLiVaa	While you live under someone else's roof, abide by their rules.|`|RzeYy8dTaa	You should have listened,13 is very young to start a physical relationship.did you ever notice that you talked less and didn't get to know him as well.Your time was not spent wisely.   I'd ask if you can see each other if there are other people around always.Or just at your house.  You broke the trust ,now you have to earn it back.You grandma only wants what is best for you.  She isn't so strict,You are young,sweet and Innocent.That can change before you know what has happened.Try to get to know a person and enjoy their company.making out gets a lot of emotions involved that neither of you are ready to handle.You have no experience of what kissing and touching can do to a young man.Be safe and take things slow.Just have fun getting to know each other.The better the friendship the better the relationship will be.|`|0iJSa2c1aa	Why do you need a boyfriend at 13? You're still a child!|`|L6lU3sksaa	Why cant u see him?? what happen?    can u tell me more info maybe i can help u|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	listen to grandma. you are too young. you will understand, and thank her when you are older.    it is has nothing to do with Jehovah's witness . any adult who cares about you would not let you be alone with a boy, especially a 15 year old|`|o0G9Z04Aaa	Try to convince her or try to secretly meet up with him.|`|fhRIsoPKaa	Why can't you explain that you like him a lot and that her beliefs aren't necessarily what you have in priority? I think you need to talk to your grandmother about this. After all, she was your age once and *might* understand if you maturely come to her and give her your opinions. Explain that you were sorry you hurt her, but you're not sorry for actually doing it because it was something you wanted to do. You shouldn't be punished for doing something you feel is right. Good luck.|`|5IYCSFVuaa	be mature and don't complain, that will only make her think you are immature and will definitely not help you to see him again.  after a while, sit down with her and assure her that you will not do anything bad with him and tell her that you will respect her wishes, and really want to spend time with him.  when you guys hangout again, if you decide to make out, make sure you don't get caught, or tell her you didn't.    goodluck!|`|MYbRICxqaa	My dear you are only 13 years old. I think you should respect their wishes for you and him. What is the hurry? You made your bed now lay in it. Next time if you want to do this, you better plan it right.
K68wnJ4Faa	It means she's been appearing in your sleep nothing else... unless you want it 2 b... wait ur a chick!|`|ThfHrcc4aa	Maybe you could like her or she could be being mean to you and this could be effecting you mentally which should be sorted out. Most likely it's a unresolved issue.
Mj0BA4Yvaa	Do something that will better yourself in the long run.  Don't just choose something to waste time or serves no purpose.  If you learn a life skill, you will be all the better for it.  Here's a few things things I wish I had learned back when I was your age.      Learn to grow a garden  Learn to build a computer  Learn to dance  Learn to cook  Learn to backpack and set up camp sites.  Learn basic engineering and robotics  Learn how to work on a car and do simple repairs and maintenance.    Get involved in your community.  Volunteer.  Get to know the people in City Hall and local government.  In 4 years you will be 18 and if you make a good impression on these people and learn to work with them, it could provide considerable help for you in the future when you are grown.|`|020600304fdab18bd45030f27f3c19adaa	Take your pick:  Martial Arts  Football  Fencing  Horseback riding  Chess  Swimming|`|AA11489001	It depends on if you want to have hobbies with others or by yourself.    I love reading, playing guitar....   church events too.|`|MSDiDQveaa	I play the guitar, have done for years - that can be a lot of fun and very rewarding - snooker is something I've got very much into lately.

Sih0xHJgaa	Just tell her that you really care about her still but you don't think it would work between you two again. Just emphasize that you still think she is a good person and care about her just that you're not right together and that she'll find someone.

Wait until you can drive yourself. Dates are meaningless, especially in elementary school.|`|AA10858530	It can be hard to date someone when you're that young.  Neither of you have a job to pay for going on dates or a car to go places, and most parents of 10 year olds don't exactly support their kids going on dates, especially their daughters, so even if you were to ask her on a date, there's a good chance she wouldn't be allowed to go.
Cb5N6UaQaa	If you can do it . Go for it. Try it at least.|`|2afVnStxaa	Before you go off the deep end you should find out what she thinks of you. Obviously you and her son get along and obviously she is very attractive to you. But if you approach this in the blind you could lose both your student and the object of your affection. Why not ask her to come with you and to bring her son along to say an amusement park or a movie and then get to know her. Let her tell you about herself, once she begins to feel comfortable she will open up to you. Then you can show her your maturity and see if she begins to feel something for you as well. But make the day a casual thing. Be casual when you ask. Best thing to do is to get tickets to something, three of them and make sure it is something that her son would like. Then without telling her how you got the ticket just say, hey I have these tickets... Then see how the day goes. Good luck to you.|`|j7o7RsZKaa	Ya just stick with the piano thts kinda nasty|`|uly3aFqtaa	One word:                  Cradlesnatcher.|`|JIATcwW6aa	I don't always thing age makes a huge difference, it depends on the maturity of the individuals.  In your case, however, there is a vast difference between your worlds.  Wait a while, see what happens.  I wouldn't want a man some 15 years younger than me.  You're about the right age to be a big brother to her son, maybe you should try that.|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	There's nothing wrong with that! You can't help who you're into. Society telling us an age limit is just stupid (unless it's a legality thing... There are laws for a reason). Personally I think the best relationships are those with an age gap. People who are too close in age can't learn as much from each other.   I think you should crank up the charm with this woman, but don't lay it on so thick that it gets creepy. You want her to know you like her, and to have the option to take it to the next level, but you don't want her to feel trapped if you're coming on too strong.  Go for it - good luck!|`|647d90c817d50303cceb01679642cbd4aa	nothing wrong with a cougar!|`|fDcdxbbQaa	You have to find out if she is into you.|`|I7eOQ1cpaa	watch notes on a scandal then make your decision|`|T9io7k8aaa	I think you need to surround yourself with people close to your age but at your maturity level. It's normal to be having some type of crush on her she's the type of woman you'd probably like to meet and a wonderful mother figure.. but she's probably not the one for you and you have to think of the domage you could do to her and her kid if you got involved..at your age your feelings are likely to change and it's best if you keep those feelings to yourself. 9/10 those feelings will pass but its definitely a sign that you need to hang out with people who are as mature as you (no nececessarily older)|`|oZuiq138aa	i think ur young and it may be hard for you.  i think its good u wanna help and stuff  but if u like older woman find someone who has less problems  her son prolly be alright  i had the same story with dad and it only made me stronger|`|OfPSBAu5aa	You should ask the son if it's okay for you to have an opportunity with his mother. If it's a yes, then have him help you out. It's always to get an approval from the child. If the son's say no, there's a good reason why. He might probably feel offended that you, at such a younger age, could possibly be his future dad...    either way it's always good to get the child's approval.|`|x8rYunYeaa	as long as ur at leats over 18 i see no problem in it. and it also depends on the age of the kid  if he's old enough to recognize that you guys are so close in age then you're more of a big bro.  but if not then by all means go. age aint nothin but a number  its your life and no one else's  make yourself happy =]|`|MYbRICxqaa	I don't account you adhere affections for her then you may. I account you are due absorbed in her life and additionally characteristically in her son. I account you should accept her not going to give you affections back..|`|tLZYilZJaa	dont do it|`|AxhYMmD3aa	pics please|`|448z7bSPaa	i think you should tell her how you feel kuz as a single mom i kno i would have affection for some one that cares for my son and treats him nice but maybe shes not into u so u MUST talk to her just to make sure kuz u dont wanna fall too hard for her..
d1yfZzCHaa	It's natural to like your best friend because you know everything about them and they know everything about you. I don't know you but some times friends really are better as friends. Before you do anything make sure the possibility of a working relation is a really good chance because you have to factor in that your relationship with him will never be the same It sounds like he might like you but you'll have to ask yourself if the chances of him liking you are worth the chances of losing him as a friend. If you decide it's worth it all you can do is ask him out once again it can't hurt if you think it's worth it.|`|a9DjyK7gaa	He does like you, just coerce him into telling you. Just make him admit he likes you and you will become an item. That is a very difficult situation and if you don't respond to him it will only be more difficult as time progresses.
hDeNKwNpaa	smart, funny, fun, can be her self, likes to hangout, nice,  looks dont really matter to me

ou7GQWh3aa	She is most definitely into you. Its called being 'coy', she doesn't want to make it obvious that she likes you, but she also wants you to know that she likes you...all at the same time.    ask her out or something and make this relationship official.|`|5XfbXMFjaa	ohk.  so she knows your into her.  maybe shes into you too.  when she looks away and hides her face, maybe she's just bein shy because she likes you.  ya never know.|`|hSubLAVhaa	Maybe she doesn't want you to see her reaction and maybe she does like you but doesn't want to tell you.

naequcqlaa	I would STRONGLY advise you to meet him in a place where there are people around.  Do NOT go to his home or where he lives & be alone w/him before you get to know him first.  I don't know your ages, but just please be careful.  Just remember, he's the same exact person you've been talking to all this time on your web cam.  The only thing different is that you'll be w/him in person.  So if you just keep in mind he's the same person you already know, that just might help you.  But just be very careful in where you meet him & do not be at a place where you'll be alone.  Just play it safe please...Enjoy your date...:)|`|TqYqQgxEaa	Well im in the same position though i am meeting him in two months and i am flying over there, i have talked to him for over 7 months now and well ...be careful and make sure you let your closest friend know where you are going to be...good luck;)

Only your father's legal status to his current wife is what describes your relationship to her.    if he had been married to his current wife the entire time and you were the product of an extramarital affair, she would still be your stepmother.|`|AA11330914	step son.|`|umzzx0Noaa	yeah lexsy is right- you are her step-son
WbJx8Hm1aa	i think that maybe your wasting your time on it.  trust me i did the same thing and i got nothing but a  lonely heart  he probably moved on and started a new life.so please dont expect him to come back if he doesnt have a reason to.  You can easily find someone who can fill that empty space he left  and you'll be happier instead of just waiting around  i know it's hard,very hard...but eventually you'll find someone nearby and that old guy will be a memory:)  Goood luck|`|8iT9DcNcaa	if it was meant to be then he will, sometimes letting go is the only way that you can move on with your life. well if you guyz were tight then he'll call if he's got your number, this will also depend on how you parted ways and if he felt strongly about you like you do. if you can try and let go this is helthy and very helpful.|`|TN85Mlvqaa	When I was young in highschool I had a friend that I lost touch with. Evetually with a positive attitude I met up with her. Even I after I lost touch with her again when she moved I found out she moved back and now we still talk. It was due to the positive attitude and good karma. So keep up the positive attitude and do good things and he'll be back soon.
4LsF70cjaa	I can't answer your question but wanted to let you know that if you gave an accurate description of your behavior, your "friends" have got to be the most egotistical people in the world.  I would LOVE to know more people like you; people that think to include someone rather than leave him left out.  But here is some food for thought.  Maybe you have friends in too many places.  What I mean is, you stay on the peripheral of several groups but aren't actually IN the group.  Therefore, if your friend in group A goes out, he goes out with group A, not people in group C or someone outside of group A.  But you sound like a great person and you will find that as you and your friends mature, that your situation will change.  As the little cliques break up, they will come to appreciate you more and more.  Good luck.|`|HKSvivc2aa	I had the same problem... If you and your friends are big on texting just check up with them as much as possible. If they're hanging out or making plans just ask them if you can tag along,I had one friend who forced himself everywhere, we would all be hanging out when one of us gets a text "What are you doing?" which is followed by "I'll be there, wait for me."    Also, try to meld into your friends interests, make yourself seem like the best friend, but don't come off as a tool. Humans are primates and instincts call for an unspoken hierarchy, so don't let yourself seem like the lesser being. Aim for alpha-male. Don't offer too much, and don't take too much.
KcYaPYhhaa	Just come up to her really casually and just say this:    "Hey _________, are you going to the dance with anyone?"    if she says no than say:    "Well would you wanna go with me?"     If she says yes than say "Oh ok, Cool! Well I'll see you there! (and smile like its no big deal)    Don't make her feel really bad about it IF she doesn't say yes. But I bet she will.|`|sYEf626Aaa	Just say "Hi i`m GAhS Spitfire, would you like to go to a semi-formal with me"?  and if she says no say "**** you *****"|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	To do ask her out, just do it.    Yes, hot girls are usually not asked out because guys are too nervous.    If she says no, just move on. Plenty of fish in the sea.    To make it near impossible for her to say no, just ask her, like I said earlier. It's much easier to just do it and not over plan.
AA11909552	I'm a bit older. So, you might not care for my advice, but I'd love to help.  Don't go too heavy on the makeup, but maybe just a little thicker on the eyeliner.  Do not dress too swanky. This might put out the wrong impression. Comfort is the most important thing here, cos you will be in skates for most of the night. You wouldn't want to add more pain to your already throbbing feet.  Guys do love a gal wearing something sleek & revealing, but remember... you might fall here or there. So, I do not recommend a skirt. Unless, of course, it's a skort, or something that covers the private area(s).  Just be friendly and don't be shy. There will be plenty of people your age at those things. And most of them are just waiting to meet you. Be confident with a dash of persistence. Hold your head uP high and take no prisoners. You'll do just fine! Have a great time and be safe.
Cb5N6UaQaa	A fling can spark a lot of things . If you want it go get it. call him. And do with him what you can. At least if you take an iniciative you will know where you stand and will know what are your chances at this at all. I hoipe you can get what you want. In any other case try moving on to the next chapter. Good Luck!!
igBds5Lhaa	don't worry life only gets harder as you get older. high school is a breeze compared to the real world.   but if your seriously considering killing your self and your not just looking for attention you should sit down with your parents and even a counselor and talk about it and hopefully they can help you instead of shutting you out and if that ddoesn'twork then just remember tthere'salways something to look forward to in life no matter what the pain what the cost or risk it will come to you in your greatest time of need and if it hhasn'thappened yet then there is still worse to come for you so hang in tight cuz its a bumpy roller coaster but its plenty fun to.  good luck.|`|sCGWcJTFaa	That's not a serious problem so don't end your life. Look you aren't missing any fun at all and just wait till your back heals then try for the track. Also so what if your friends are at the mall? It's not like you won't be able to shop with them next time. Your best friend is being a jerk, so you might as well tell her how you feel about she's doing to you.|`|tsdHndRhaa	if you cannot participate im gym then get a doctors slip for your back issues, and don't be nervous track is a competitive sport but if you feel that you can do it, then let nothing stop you and belive in yourself, cuz if you don't who will. and sometimes you have to make a sacrifice for something you want to do, and that can be not having alot time to spend with your friends.|`|UQT37xS1aa	First of all, don't be worrying about your track tryouts! If your good, then go for it! Even if your not so good, do it for fun! If you like it, do it. Hmm, just try to have fun in PE. And the back problems and stuff... hmm, just try to have fun without them i guess, and pretend that they're at home, just like you. And if they were your friends, they should be at home with you, not out shopping...    And i don't know about your best friend, but why would she do that? She's probably trying to get back for something, so ignore it!     just look for the positive side! I mean, seriously, no need to end your life for such little problems. You'll get over them soon.|`|y8OhPOt3aa	I know what you mean.  In 7th grade i really didn't know what to do.  My grandfather just died and i was really depressed  My social status dropped and I made all A's i just had no friends  My mom thought I needed therapy but I said no to that   because the little friends I had already thought I was major weirdo  But my parents were also strict and and never let me do anything social like go to the mall or sleepovers or anything.        what i did  was was( and I know this sounds stupid) was keep a little book to write in, like a composition book, and write down sad poems and that always made me feel better.   Also, even though it's hard to admit, I needed someone to talk to, maybe a psychologist, but instead it was actually easier to talk to my parents  So maybe you should talk to them, they always knew how to help me.|`|0zmMikKHaa	It's ok. Things may seem really bleak and grim and nasty and not worth it at all but one day you'll stop and look back on all this and know it was for a reason. To prepare you. To make you stronger. To improve yourself. I went through a time during my life where everything just seemed like it was falling apart. Literally. But now! Things are all falling into place. It is just the rollercoaster of life. If it's getting really bad though, talk to someone you trust. A best friend (probably not the one thats rubbing stuff in your face), a parent, a teacher, a older brother/sister. Some one in your life cares. I know it for a fact. Find them and tell them what is going on. Just talk to them and let it all out. I'm sure you will be just fine, there is no need for quick decisions.|`|IwrS9zw1aa	just plop|`|kkIVKvitaa	Don't be nervous about try outs. Just do the best you can.  Tell your parent or a nurse about your back problems.  Make your friend jealous. Act like you dont care and then go hang out with someone else.  It's okay kid. Everyone gets depressed sometimes.
ui54xkRNaa	Yes, the decision you made was a good thing. Your bestfriends and making her happy is wat a bffl does. Think of it if the tables were turned and it was you and the guy and she was left in the side wings, she would let you guys date if she was a good friend. you made a good choice, its hard i know but boyfriends come and go, bestfriends are there forever.
UXd0mYMSaa	it depends on how it ended the first time. a) he just wants to make sure you're really serious about it this time because he doesn't want to get hurt again, b) he's waiting because he doesn't trust himself yet, and he doesn't want to hurt you again, or c) he really isn't sure he wants to go through the whole relationship thing again so he's putting off the whole "asking you out" thing and hoping you can just hookup.    either way, its kind of sketchy so i would either ask him out if you really want to (sometimes guys like that) or reconsider what it is that youre so attracted to, and if its a real reason that you feel strongly about than keep it up and hopefully he'll step up.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	He wants to think out very long before taking the relationship to the next level.  He doesn't want to break your heart again like last time.
3dce72416db54e65d90217c2e45ac106aa	haha i just posted almost the same question!  i'm going to bake my boyfriend a cake and  then maybe buy him something to go with.    you say he's hard to please...so maybe the best thing to do is something that you put a lot of effort into.  maybe a coupon book with flirty things like, "one kiss during a movie" "one free back massage"....little things like that and maybe even more sexy depending on how long you guys have been dating or how comfortable you are around each other.  they can be goofy too!    another idea that i have done for a friend is simple, but also shows that you care.  take a piece of colored paper and if you're feeling artsy, decorate it a little.  Then, write down a list of memories, silly or romantic, that you've had together.  My last idea (i promise) is something i've done a couple times too.  Say he's turning 20 (just an example), go on the computer and type out, each on a separate line, 20 things that you love/like about your boyfriend.  make them different fonts and colors.  then, print out the page and cut them out so they're in strips.  fold them in half and stick them in a cute mug or cup with chocolates.    Good luck!
7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	It depends on where you live.  Is paternity established? Is child support paid by either of you? Is there custodial agreement?    It probably depends on where she wants to take the child.

Be positive that he knows your boundaries and respects them.  Ask your friends to give him a chance and be supportive of your decision.  Try to spend equal amount of time with your friends and your boy.  Getting the whold group together might help. Or just get him and one of your friends so that way the two of them can get on a more friendly level.  Please do not let him pressure you into anything you are not ready for.  And if you are ready please be protected.
KcYaPYhhaa	Whatever you do, DON'T leave him hanging. Just simply say this:    You are such a sweet guy and you're really nice but I don't think things are going to work out for us. I'm sorry. And the reason I think they won't work out is because __________"     Good luck and I'm sorry your in this position.|`|wzue5Xzbaa	Call and explain how you feel to him. He should understand....if he doesn't, man is he immature.    ;)|`|FTZ8kQ9Qaa	what are your ages??????let him downEASY!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Azj1nMZVaa	are u a boy or a girl,if u are a guy then that's gross if u are a girl than that's alright if i were a girl i would tell him the truth|`|qV3wtsz2aa	just break up with him, tell him you think it wont work out and it's better for the both of us|`|a1c2e3b65590e667705d553083d61ceaaa	Just tell him that u guys are better off friends. Telling him ur busy wif ur job and he going to school, not enough time to spent time together.
mCUNl9Wgaa	You tell them to shape up or ship out.
P13CZbbzaa	Sweetie, just go for it!  If you're gonna let a classification get between your guy and you then you don't really like him.    I dated a junior when i was a senior, and believe me it's not big deal, he was even a year younger than me (although he looked older than me).   But don't let the little things bother you and miss out on possibly great things!      Good Luck! :)|`|3kNeWYvdaa	Go ahead and date him it's fine it won't be awkward unless you make it so. My aunt is older than my uncle by one or two years and they have been married for about 10 yrs. and has 3 kids.See? Doesn't matter at all! As long as you like each other:)|`|huNpyxV7aa	thats fine  you might get made fun of chicka|`|qMu6Tdrhaa	Its perfectly fine to date him. Age is just a number, it doesn't matter! And if your friends make fun of you for it, then they aren't REAL friends|`|mLUm0tllaa	Why would that be awkward, it'll only be weird if you really care about what other people think...If you really do like him, you should totally go for it!|`|idrRW9M7aa	I'd say no worries on that front.  For all intents and purposes you're the same age.|`|UXd0mYMSaa	if you like him, it's definitely okay. but if you feel uncomfortable about the age difference, there's a good chance it'll always be a problem because your age difference will never change. like, if you didn't like the guys hair, that could change, but his age obviously can't. personally, i think if you like him and he likes you it's all good :)|`|TfOfVRYnaa	Do what you want to do. Age don't matter.|`|AA11425983	It's ok.  Why would it be awkward?|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	its ok. i know a girl who is a junior, and she is dating a sophmore, pretty much the same thing.|`|IF4ugIYraa	My Dad's friend is married to someone that his ten years younger than him.|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Just do it. I've answered my last few questions like that. It's getting repetitive. Age doesn't matter.|`|p9TofJKBaa	I did that in high school (3 years ago) It was awkward at first, but he looked like a senior because he was on the football team, and he had a great personality so it was cool. we were together almost a year :-)|`|alxuJVsCaa	It's okay to date him. If you really like him, then it doesn't matter if he's a junior. I know a sophomore dating an 8th grader.|`|yGWQuL81aa	My friend's boyfriend is like three years younger then her. No one cares, the younger guys just tell him he's lucky he dates older women and we laugh about it all the time.|`|FToKY4T5aa	go for it!!!!i know a senior dating a sophmor...and they are as happy as can be!!!|`|dyr8uiLxaa	no|`|GyENXDKNaa	No! Its definitely OK to date him!  All that matters is that you two want to be together!    My brother's girlfriend is a year older than him too!|`|dzROtYVxaa	i think its so ok to date him who cares what people think or that he is a grade lower...if you have that connection then thats all that matters!    |`|HX5MdJVSaa	It isn't really that big of a deal if you are going by age, anyway. I would do what you want to do but it sounds ok to me :)|`|fce1fc32f8848480d752f7cb81cdc93faa	I believe it is okay to date anyone with a two years difference. So go for it and good luck.|`|dxPIPCESaa	well 4 mi opinion no u should not wait i might sound like your parent but did you talk 2 ur mom bout dis and see if its alright cuz u could get in big trouble|`|qoJUelIxaa	its ok|`|HEI2Zx8Haa	I hate that it looks bad to date younger guys. if he's the same age, go for it!! you don't want to lose this guy just because of the stupid stereotype|`|cAcjyPHkaa	If you like him, you should, my sister was a senior and dated a junior. But don't make this decided for you.|`|Iw8UYrpVaa	date him!! who cares what people think anyways. lol if you like him. and you think youll be happy go for it... youll probably beat yourself up for not taking that chance later on anyways.    one of my great friends is a senior.. and shes really close with a sophmore guy.. but they would be perfect for each other and they already act like theyre married and been together for years.. i know she thinks about it.. but she wont do it bc of the age. i dont blame her though since shes going to be graduating this year though..|`|cc09cedaebf78cf81eee61de372a98bdaa	Listen, it's okay to date him. I know that traditionally the guy is older and the girl is younger.. but in the long scheme of things it doesn't matter at all. I know a senior girl dating a sophomore boy! What matters is how you feel, and tell everyone who calls you a "cradle robber" go go play in traffic because you're happy :]|`|a1c2e3b65590e667705d553083d61ceaaa	It's totally fine. My friend is like the same as you, i just tease her a bit saying pedo. LOL. =X
sU3n0TQEaa	Introduce yourself. Joke about things. Find a connection that you guys share. Don't over do it like asking her personal questions. If you were in school, then pretend you don't understand the homework and ask her or ask her to let you borrow her planner to copy down the assignments you didn't copy down and make your little convo then.|`|j7o7RsZKaa	well first you open your mouth, then you use your words, its really very simple.
Lhn7D9L8aa	Go and be nice and say hello. try to start a conversation with her.get to know her.|`|ba798d2ca6d10aef9906bd4f8320e85daa	Usually, just opening up your mouth and expressing vocal sounds in the form of English words works pretty well (avoid the guttural grunts if you are trying to impress her) ... good luck with it.|`|EzBGRjZMaa	lmao  what bald is beatiful said
FreIeKgVaa	go to the doctor
ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	You should def apoligize, and do it in person...and hope she accepts it|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	yes, say sorry to her face!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You have no right to gossip about her boyfriend.  You may want to apologize to her face to face and ask her if she can make up to anything.|`|H1UzYl8haa	she needs to get a scense of humor and just laugh this off  its childish thats she's gettin mad over this   but if you feel that you need to put her in her place by saying no YOU need to realize that a joke IS a joke...then do so    guud luck sweatie|`|hDAoKmjPaa	yes you should apologize to her in person. it will show her that you are sincere and really mean it and want to make up.|`|357BF35maa	yeah ur right... but does her bf really have herpes...|`|GybjVZxtaa	If you know he does and they're having sex or are going to, then heck to the yes tell her in person. If you're not sure, just ask her to please make sure he doesn't before they do anything. If you don't think he does you just don't want them to have sex.... tell her you don't think sex is a good idea yet and just let it go.|`|M3r1s6oYaa	Good. Do it face to face. DO NOT TEXT IT!!!! If you need a special place or a special time the movies have thoose 2 things.And dont txt her afterwards.    When the movie is done ask her to come over your place to have a snack or something. This will be a graetway to do some catchup if you need it.
JbdNFTj0aa	You probably annoy the piss out of him.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	I do not think you have anything to worry about. at times guys need room to breath. or a little time to themselves. this is as he said, to think about things. it should be seen as if he is just taking a brake and to relax, a little. but do not worry, he still cares for you. we all need to take time for ourselves just to relax and think about things. at times a guy will do this to make a decision about his life. or just think about where his future is going. as we will also do this before asking a female to get married or what ever. he just has to have time to think. but I cannot tell you what it is he has on his mind. but I am sure if it has something to do with you, he will let you know. but this may not have anything at all to do with you, so do not worry about this. it could be about anything.|`|cswHfmFdaa	happened many times. he still wnats to be with u he wudnt just randomly not want to unless uve been having many problems. my bfs done that when i talk to him when hes in a bad mood because he may have something on his mind u just annoyed him. hell be sorry by morning.|`|63K1Evnzaa	im a guy and i sometimes feel this in relationships. he feels this way either because your smothering him, or annoying him. he wants to be single, have more options, be able to hang with friends, etc. if it continues to not work out, i'd suggest breaking up, then getting back together later.|`|1AJXpCL6aa	I dont think he knows what he's doing, honey
GBr9YngTaa	Yes you are still with him. Give him time. Perhaps something scared him or something happened. Give him his space and wait for him to come to you. If he doesn't and breaks up with you, than you should be glad that you didn't have sex with him.|`|Ksilu2Zyaa	Calm down he is having problems with something besides you or whatever.....this probably has nothing to do with you.|`|YK1JuIlWaa	i would say it is very clear  he has another lover and i am sure it's a man|`|rCc5uBDTaa	just give him time to think.  but yeah.  yall didn't break up.  its just kinda like vacation sorta.  just tell him to call you when he wants to talk.|`|hBxmFnqNaa	maybe he was worrid about something or frustrated whn he was texting you|`|mOxVL0luaa	being in a relationship its a complicated stuff, i myself if i put myself in ur bf point of view, i'd say i need a break too, coz maybe thing run so smooth and somehow too fast for ur bf to catch up. and don't worry girl u're still with him and hes maturing too, he think about both side of the relationship if not he won't hesatite on having sex with u ^^ its a positive things. give him some time for him to be back on track atm stay beautiful to ur bf lolz|`|RzeYy8dTaa	Wait on the sex I think he may have second thoughts about that.You are not ready for a sexual relationship.You are still getting to know each other.You don't understand whats happening now.It doesn't get clear all of a sudden after sex.  Build the foundation for a lasting relationship get to know each others feeling and expectations.Being a loving couple is more than you had sex.It's about long term goals and dreams.Place the value on yourselves higher.That you both are worth the wait.  It seems like so many young people are into have sex but don't even know themselves. You are giving a part of you,that each time you do a piece of you goes with it.It won't be there for a husband or wife.the     specialness is gone.Pride goes so think very carefully what you are giving.Give the young man some thought don't panic.I doubt if he's doing anything except thinking.Another thing each time you give yourself do you think the value goes up?Don't move so fast.|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	i think he thinks it's moving way too fast. just give it some time. it'll be fine.|`|rd5468H1aa	I think you're reading into nothing. Maybe he does have something to think about-- he may be going through something hard right now. Just listen to him and back off for a little bit until he sorts out his problems.|`|s6RS4J8Qaa	1. calm down.  2. maybe it's just moving a little fast for him, give it a few days and ask him a little later.|`|Gjyd1W5Waa	that may be the right thing to do let him cool off and then try talking to him|`|CIwBOKCWaa	Don't have sex with him..  Like most guys just go out with girls just for the sex.  But other guys no...  But he sounds like a guy who just does it for the sex..  I'm being very honest!|`|Aw1Kd0eRaa	dont do him yet he might but he might be having problems   *good things happen tp people who wait*|`|N4GreuqEaa	dont have sex..     if a guy say "i need a bk" he means i wan to bk up and meet someone else.. or he just dont wan to be in relationship.  you need to solve you prblem and have sex after after..    -dont have sex just becuz u guys are okie..after u guys talked and re-think about having sex again for long time...|`|DDCKVEyyaa	**first of all, I'm sorry about your problem...  I advice you to txt your bf of just plain call  him on the phone  (if possible, go out and see him)  and say how you really feel about him saying "having a break" with you.. tell it to him straight and don't keep your mouth shut about these things or it will get worst. About the sex thing, I don't want you think I'm getting ahead of you, but, you sound too young... and you should lose your femininity to a guy who doesn't want a brake just because the both of you are having problems..  once is said and done, everything will be understood...  Good Luck..|`|pwSKT2Aeaa	there maybe a possibilty he only did that so he can have sex with you|`|DUPOEk1daa	Don't do him....  You sound super young.|`|985b69c21f5ec27c902473285145042baa	Wait it out. Give him some time to think like he wants.|`|ZJg26cAmaa	cool down first and dont explode. just send him a nic etest " are we together still?" or something along those lines|`|kLYXrYh2aa	your insane.|`|a9DjyK7gaa	You're crazy...stalker...|`|a1c2e3b65590e667705d553083d61ceaaa	you should ask him if he is stressing about the sex part? o-o Maybe something happen in his life and need time chill.|`|KM6PDz5qaa	Either he said that, so he can make you MORE comfy to have sex with him. Or he really means it.|`|FM614SKQaa	maybe it was one of his friends. I wouldn't worry either way.|`|Blh3T9HGaa	give this guy time i bet he loves  you alot just needs to think about his actions my gf asks me about sex i kinda change subjects because i aint wanting to talk about this now feel uncomfy like this i bet thats how he is|`|x66TTEymaa	wow maybe he was just saying that so you could "get with him"   just leave it be for a while|`|sWFIJtGmaa	I do this to boys alot.  But i do it because it means i like someone else.  You obviously aren't doing anything wrong if you guys didn't get into a fight or anything and if hes been saying i love you today.  So let him have time to think.  He will get annoyed if you keep bugging him about it.  But if you do figure it out, then dont have sex just yet.  If he really does love you, it means he would want to be in a relationships with you, but if there was something wrong he would talk to you about it.  the only thing i can think of is that another girl is talking to him, such as a girl hes always had a crush on, or maybe an ex he hasnt gotten over.  dont confront him just yet.   give him space.  when hes ready to talk, he will.   and when you do talk, dont attack him with questions.  Try to resolve it in a very adult manner.|`|jOZhUTMWaa	my friend went through something similar. it sounds like he is getting scared, maybe from the step you are taking towards sex.  maybe he really isnt ready, and is afraid and embarrassed to tell you that.  Things might be getting to serious for him to handle at the moment.  It sounds like he is confused himself, and i would let him try to figure things out for himself.  Maybe you shouldnt bring up the whole sex thing for a while, but definately let him know that you love him, and you dont thin you need a break (if thats how you feel)|`|AgFJyMjKaa	As long as he didn't say I wanna break up with you everything should be fine. I need to think is sorta like saying we just need a brake for a little bit. but you should really consider the sex thing. are you really in love with him? and if you are, the question is; is he really in love with you? best of luck girl! just make wise decisions. (:
bdade993e630dbc15f1df344277bad03aa	act normal and ask again after a while? This time not over the phone. You gotta ask her straight up and see her reaction. Be confident and ask her like you mean it. Don't shy away.
TDvkeOU4aa	I hope i can find a nice wife one day lol. I take orders very well (im serving in the army). Maybe in college when i get my engineering degree next year. I don't think hes the marrying type of guy so i would just find some one better. I think you gave him a long enough grace period so if he was gonna do it he would of done it already.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Why are you waiting???? I would let him know that you obviously do not want the same things in life. You want to get married and start a family and he doesn't. Just leave it at that. If he wants you, he will come back. If not, he was just playing around until you got fed up with it. Don't give an ultimatum because, like you said, then you will never know if he realy wanted it. Good luck!|`|AA10540570	if you stopped having sex with him & he didn't marry u it may never happen!|`|I3Jywei7aa	he got want he wanted and that was sex|`|0d4X54rMaa	are you kidding? 9 years?  the only way to have him marry you is to leave him  if he loves you.. i mean really love you....he will want to marry you  if he doesnt it will be the excuse he needs to leave you    but at least this way you are not on hanging on a string for another 9 years until he finally decides he wants out and you have wasted 18 yrs with him    good luck
bec77fe70053715a66b5fd7e555ab863aa	ok, so i KNOW its hard to let a guy go. because you think you have this special connection, belive me! i really do know. im a girl, hah i get thiss :] but anyway, this guy sounds like a TOTAL jerk, i mean come on? the ONLY way he would go with you is if YOUR ALONE AND HE CAN TOUCH AND MAKE OUT?!!!! thats sooo rediculous and degrading, its horrbile. horriiibleeee! you dont deserve that. at all, and i want and need you to get that through your head. SECOND, he said he LOVED you, and a couple days later he has a girlfried? thats another extremely bad sign. hes not real about anything, hes only in a realtionship for sex. i swear. and i know you said not to say hes not worth it, but COME ON re-read the question, you dont deserve any of that ****. its hard to move on but even harder trying to get over damage a guy can do. trust me, this guy is no where near worth anything. slowly let him go, focus on something else, yeah its gonna be hard, but you'll look back on this one day and be like WOW he wa a total d-bag.    seriouslyyy no jokee girl, i know wht it feels like, but you gotta get this boy outta yer head. i wish you the best :] xox britt|`|edq4QzCMaa	hes being kinda mean... when he asked you to make out with you and then he got a girlf  talk to him|`|pH1k2l58aa	hes a player and used your emotions. you apparently dont want to hear it but it needs to be said: HES A LOSER AND YOU NEED TO FORGET ABOUT HIM ESPECIALLY IF HE JUST WANTED TO TOUCH YOU AND MAKE OUT WITH YOU AS A WAY FOR HIM TO GO SOMEWHERE!  i hope i helped you make this important decision of letting him go; stay strong your a girl!!!|`|0435c3993c3b05aec46c72cda7b5faa0aa	whoa. you totally deserve better!!! I don't care if he is the president of the world, no one has the right to treat you like an object and you need to let him know that! I realize that you really like, and I can really relate because I have been in the same situation, but he doesn't love you. He is using you. HE tells you what you want to hear so you will do what he wants you to. If you are ohk with being just friends with benefits, then that is your call. But if you are romantically interested in him, which you seem you are, then you will avoid a lot of heartache if you begin the process of "breaking up" with him now.|`|u3xzrJszaa	Wait a bit. If he breaks up with his gf step in. He may have just got a gf, to upgrade in popularity. But seriously.. nvm..|`|hoY0aoMYaa	forget about him. if the only reason he was goin to take you to the movies is to make out with you instead of just spendin time with you, then hes not the guy you should be thinking about|`|jvevMDFeaa	in a way it kind of sounds like you dont exactly want advice then from the "please dont say he isnt worth it or anything" a guy whos abusive is not the kind of guy to be with. You might say well he doesnt beat me.. hes hurting you mentally and thats just as bad if not worse.. he only wants you when its convenient for him and thats extremely wrong to do to you. I would honestly tell him to go play with his little girlfriend and leave you alone. you need to get away from it and i would say a clean break would be way better.. imo
Mwc1zdAdaa	Don't listen to these people. While I have not done it personally, I know people who do it, and also from recent studies on marriage, it is the most common way that most newlyweds meet.    I know this isn't related to your question, but what these people are saying about meeting someone online is rude. My guess is you've been talking to this person for a little while and trust them, and they trust you.    As to your question though, I would not bring gifts quite yet, just because they are older and it can be hard for older children to adapt to someone new, and they will not appreciate them in the way you'd want them to. Form some kind of a relationship with them before you do this. If they were younger my philosophy on this matter would be different.|`|AA12374184	Are you kiddin? Bring him a Rolex I'm sure he'll love you then. What are you nuts!! bring him nothing!! Its not like your going to meet his parents, then you can bring gifts but what you can do is look for a place to go like a landmark where you can go and talk for a while then out to dinner for a nice quiet meal and then a nice walk on the beach then whatever follows after that is nobodies business.|`|MzqZGvalaa	NO NO NO NO NO NO NO. What are you thinking?  What would you think about a man who brought presents for your kids before he meet them?  I know what I'd think. I don't think it matters that you're a woman either these days.   No, leave the children out of it for now.  If you must take something from your area then make it something decorative for the house, that the whole family can enjoy.  There's something creepy about people paying too much attention to the kids too early, buying toys and stuff like that... it's suss you know?   I hope the meeting goes well. and that he's a nice bloke.  Good luck honey.  P.S. 18 & 20 year old's aren't children by any stretch of the imagination.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	NO! Why do people meet and date online?|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Maybe cookies? I guess it depends on how well you guys have gotten to know eachother, but if you can think of a decent little thing to bring, I don't see why not. Kind of sounds like a good opener, but nothing showy. I still like the cookie idea =)|`|idrRW9M7aa	nooo|`|F8Qwlvbjaa	please be careful and if you go take a trusted friend with you. no gifts for now. i fell into a similar situation. make sure he is what he says then break out the small gifts later.|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	No. Don't bring gifts. That might send the message that you feel like you're already involved in this guys' family, which you're not! It's your first time meeting; you should focus on each other.|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Small gifts.|`|sZMa0s7Baa	I don't think so. You're both meeting for the first time, so I think it's a little soon for that and might make him and/or his kids pretty uncomfortable.|`|MYbRICxqaa	No!!! No!! Are you that desperate? I hope you are take precautions.|`|Q8etYn60aa	It's a thoughtful gesture, but I really wouldn't.  I'm 22 and I remember a woman my father dated after my parents got divorced when I was about 17 years old.  She brought me and my 2 sisters, 13 and 14, gifts and we all really felt like she was trying to win us over with gifts.  We were a little offended.  Just get to know them first.|`|kdv0t93Faa	When will you meet? I'll be watching Television to see if your on the news.      DON'T DO IT! When you meat people online don't you know they can be murderers you retard! As a adult I would figure you wouldn't have to have me, a 13 year old little girl tell you this!|`|kQA7SbY9aa	The little souvenirs sound nice but I hope that you and your kids stay safe. You really never know who might be waiting to meet you when you get there.  ................................  If you're not meeting the kids, skip the gifts for them. And again, stay safe.|`|04Te5gzzaa	You are meeting the man for a date and you're both bringing your kids along?  There's no need to "bribe" his children to like you.  They are old enough to know what you and their father are up to.  Let them like you for yourself, not for the gifts you bring them.  If you keep doing it, they'll expect something from you every time you meet them.|`|e1F55L7aaa	No..They might feel violated in some ways. People can be touchy..but if you are totaly from diffrent areas, you could try something small for all of them that they might not have where they are.|`|QsoY8trZaa	OMG, be CAREFUL!!!|`|AWoH1oN0aa	i would hope that ur not even going to meet the kids so soon....im 16 and i would flip if my dad met a girl online in she tried to bring me something like she knew me i would be pissed|`|li9WGkzLaa	I am 14 years old and if my mom was meeting someone for the first time i wouldn't expect that person to bring me a gift so good luck|`|TjgESmmraa	yeah be careful.. bring a knife.. but it can't hurt to bring a littel soemting.. although those kids are really old, they don't need presents.. no don't bring anything..|`|W2RaqfWOaa	I would think she was trying too hard and it was cheezy unless it was something like chocolate.|`|alxuJVsCaa	Yes, and bring something that they might like, but just in case bring a back up gift when they don't like the first gift.|`|5524e7b67c455263a28d199a973ce432aa	I wouldn't. Take it easy, and Good Luck!|`|YfI4qVh7aa	All Three ages are to old for gifts.  Those children will think you are trying to win them over with toys/gifts and they will either expect more from you, or will see through your ploy and resent you.  Just spend a little time getting to know them.  Down the line you can get them a more personalized gift that will mean more.
nqmGblKlaa	He justs wants to know lol.|`|bYeJVSDQaa	it means he wants to know if you like him
wX7qPI3Naa	first of all hun - Boobs really DO NOT matter to a guy who would genuinely care about you. second of all - if your school has dances, get up close to him and shake the booty that you got, and make eye contact, and let him know you've been watching him(not in a creepy way!)  third- be yourself! don't change for a guy! fourth - get his number and text him, or msn him, or facebook him! Conversation is key!|`|zfm51Rpyaa	Just take care of yourself. Look pretty, smile, and laugh whenever your with him. Guys like a girl that is funny but not stupid. Plus be sweet to him. A guy will notice if you look at him from time to time and you always talk to him.|`|sWFIJtGmaa	wear less makeup  wear sexy, but not trashy, clothes [17 magazine has great tips]  long hair.  natural hair color.  boys love that.  and ask some of the boys in your school what perfum they dig.  if you are too nervous, or your guy friends dont know what to say,  then i suggest that perfum that they sell at aeropostale. the blue stuff.  my friend says he LOVES that perfume and that he wants to jump on any girl who wears it haha.  and when it comes to kissing boys, use lip balm instead of lip gloss. Use something flavored with a nice scent. Boys hate that gooey stuff on their lips. All my boyfriends used to complain about it.  A nice tan works well with anyone. But not one that looks to dark since its only winter. thats stupid. being dark is for summertime only. just be golden during the winter. if you dont want to go tanning, then buy self-tanning lotion. but follow the directions so your hands dont get orange. i used jergens and olay and i works so well. i put it all over me every day after i get out of the shower and i wipe my hand off afterwards with a damp towel and i dont get orange plams or anything.  everyone looks bettter with a glow.  and just be sweet to everyone. guys like that.  smoking is a turn off too. so are drugs.|`|5O7NmZDZaa	Honey just be yourself at all times...|`|dt4jhryFaa	get a boob job.|`|vs8qO1YHaa	take an active interest in the things he likes. be cool and aloof.|`|3Mi0miV9aa	dnt be slutty like those answers you got  flirt but dnt be all slutty about it  dnt be laughin extremely hard a joke dat he made dats not even that funny  start tlkin 2 him with no intentions of bein his girl (even tho u r)  jus be ur regular self and mayb do somethin a lil different|`|ALvp7YRuaa	get your friends to talk about you and maybe put all the good things in his head and then one day he'll flirt with you..|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Coming from a guy's perspective, I would like a girl to approach up to me and introduce herself.  This tells me that she wants me to be her friend, a great way to start when it comes to building the friendship.  And, then overtime, who knows?  I could be falling in love with her.|`|nqmGblKlaa	Just act girlish around him lol.|`|sICqdaDzaa	Hang out with his friends. Be flirty but not dumb.|`|3F6brF2xaa	b smart, have self confident do good things that are admirable make interesting stories, b helpful sweet and thoughtful,|`|mLUm0tllaa	Be you, you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't like you for who you are!|`|Ub8BP2Oeaa	When you have a C almost D cup, anything is possible....|`|N2l3G0Npaa	be everything you would want in someone|`|TjgESmmraa	a watched pot never boils..|`|Ah458EfWaa	I'd show him how i work an if he wants me he might hav 2 wait in line

VLO7e4tMaa	I'm sure I would be upset, both that he kept the card because he might still care about her, but more because he didn't tell the truth.  Maybe, he lied to spare your feelings, and maybe he had forgotten about the card.  After you can speak calmly, try to tell him how the lie and the card made you feel, and tell him that you need him to be honest with himself (if he still cares for her.) and to be honest with you!|`|eVK2zZsOaa	You probably should have just asked why he still had it in the first place but since you didn't, you can ask him why he lied. Tell him the truth, that you saw that it was from his ex and you want to know why he couldn't be truthful with you. Maybe he didn't say who it was from because he knows that you are the type to overreact about things like that. It probably means nothing to him but he doesn't feel like hearing your mouth.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	I'd ask him why he lied to me (because let's face it, a relative saying "I want your kisses all the time" is super creepy), but I wouldn't be mad that he had a card from his ex lying around.  It happens, we forget to toss stuff out.|`|btghmpQhaa	It would be suspicious because maybe he got mad you were looking at it and tried hiding it from you.    Maybe tell him your sorry.    And ask him if there is anything suspicious going on in your relationship.    Good Luck|`|L6lU3sksaa	yea i would.. just ask him why cant he tell you the truth. tell him you wont be mad if he tells you.    but i would be kinda pissed off to find that.. so yea...|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	Why didn't you just throw the card at him and ask, "Who the h*ll is this??"|`|P5Yh0poBaa	duhhr.|`|K8bzc23xaa	Yeah, I would be suspicous.|`|MsLKIJWJaa	I think I would ask him "ok? why would a family member want your kisses?" that would freak me out. If it was from a year ago it would somewhat bother me but if I have enough confidence in my self and in him then I don't think there is anything to worry about. I mean I still keep cards and Valentine stuff that ex's have given me and well others find them but I don't give it much importance. If he seems uninterested in the card and didn't get nervous when asked about it then there is nothing to worry about now if he hid it then it might show that he was ashamed or embarrassed to have someone find his "secret stash" of past loves...|`|JbdNFTj0aa	It does sound suspicious but at the same time, he probably loved her. What if you and him broke up? Would you want him throwing you out of his life. He is probably keeping those cards because he doesn't want to throw them away, even if he doesn't care about them anymore. He use to, and maybe a part of him still does. Its hard to get over love. I know people who have kept love cards and pictures of loved ones for over 40 years after breaking up. Don't get in his face about it. He probably doesn't want to pour his emotions out right in front of you. It's not easy for a guy... Either that or his still hooking up with her.|`|ebs0j7iaaa	i wouldn't be angry tht he recieved the card because he cant control what people send him.  but i would confront him on how he handled the situation. you might be surprised he may have lied as to not upset you and thrown it away straight away when he realised he left it lying around.  but by the same token he may be in contact with his ex, dont argue about it just ask calmly. :)|`|oULsgDRJaa	The past is the past ... why did you read that to begin with?     I will be careful asking him about it ... I would be rather upset if I was in his situation.
hDAoKmjPaa	im not a guy but yeah you should ask him out. if you like him then why not go for it!|`|oCG2JxsEaa	i say go for it but check and see if he likes you back. hope this helps! :PP|`|erzCdzbYaa	No, never ask a guy out! Are you retarded?  Just flirt and see how it goes from there.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	If you like him, why not?  Maybe on valentine's day. Make his day special or whatever.|`|wu2g3BtRaa	no... don't ask him outo yet just enjoy how much you like him when you see him.

They act as if you don't mean anything to them. Your just another person that is in their way. They don't give you the time of day while speaking to you and treat you as a child, almost inferior. I have found this to work because it pisses hot girls off who are always use to guys doing everything for them. When they find a guy who doesn't even acknowledge them, they stop and wonder why. It's quite effective.
0bGDcN0Iaa	I think that he likes you because i do the same sort of things with girls i like(i am 15 btw). So u should go for him.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I think this guy has deep feelings for you.  If you like him, go for it!

Maybe catch a movie and dinner and a walk through the park to talk.  Just get him before someone else does|`|2jCoGdNUaa	OK THE ALL CAPS IS KINDA HARS TO READ FAST AND ALSO KINDA ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    well ask already the worst that could happen is that might never talk to you again.|`|mOxVL0luaa	nothing, let him ask u out and until 11.59 pm on valentine eve, if he doesn't ask u out, ask him out lolz and try to makes thing clear abit to avoid major embarrassment|`|ZJg26cAmaa	lol chill with the caps     go for it its stupid to wait|`|g3HrRmaCaa	Well dont wait to ask him the day b4, cuz he might set up otha plans cuz u took to long to ask.
GckVXU4Paa	Well, my dear, keep urself engaged with some good activities like social welfare or other stuff like that. Try to spend some quality time with ur parents. If possible then discuss the kind of problem u r going through. Because in the end, it is our parents who will give u a moral & emotional support.   Troubled along with a broken heart is a very difficult situation. I can understand that. But is there really an urge to mention that u r troubled...?  No. Stand up and fight for life. Troubles are only hurdles in life. U have to overcome them on ur own. Pain, sorrow, troubles, sadness,etc. are a part and parcel of life. We can suggest and advise u. We can give u some tips. In the end, it is u who are going to lead ur life. Even if u r broken, put a smile on ur face and say in front of mirror, that u will overcome this situation. Nothing will ever break u. Even if u fall, u will rise much faster than u fall. U will again stand Tall.|`|a0b40c7a80dd3de9085039f8daf76ec6aa	Give us some more info plz.|`|oJPn5Rgtaa	chrisnos@live.com if you want to talk :)    I have no clue how to help you based on what you said.|`|CUdQ2ymEaa	Give urself some tym abt 2 or 3 months.

To improve ourselves...with each and every experience....|`|uq9KBBPNaa	details plz|`|5RlDSIeIaa	Hey I dont know why you are broken hearted but for every negative affect there is only one place where you can get peace. That is God. belive on him. He will certainly give you peace. Engulf your selves in helping others in their problems(ofcourse every problem you cannot solve) this will give you more satisfication. Then second thing go to holy places, divert your mind to God and ask for peace. he will certainly do.   It is very easy to give advice but very hard to follow, but believe me when my girl friend left me I was also the same but one of my friend pulled my hands and took to her street. She asked are you more broken then her(a 22 yr girl lost her one hand and both leg in an accident) but see she is smilling. you know why because she has faith in god. From that day one year passed. I also belived god. he gave me good job and good status, And you know what happened to tmy girlfriend she married a man and after 5 months got divorced. Now she is all alone and no one around her, even her parents also dont talk warmly. God sees the truth but waits.   So divert your mind towards god and forget what happenned. Remember God sees the truth but waits. If you have done wrong certainly you are punished if no then sit and watch oneday your patience will give fruits...I promise.  And your name SHONA is itself beautiful smile on your name only.  jazalajubail@yahoo.co.in|`|QuOnGavxaa	how we can help you.Guide us,we will try our best to make you happy.|`|Q4WxvcBUaa	Take some time out...concentrate on other things...try to forget it...move on yaar|`|TL5iKwkSaa	listen mam  think positive.  do not think of ur ex. try to make new friends. make ur self busy.  jst listen i told u a story of mine.  i was also dumped by a girl. bt i was nt sad. do u know whay???  coz i lost the one who never loved me but she lost the one who loved her soooo much.  if u want to share ur problem with me u can.  tanha_feel_2006@yahoo.co.in  ajay|`|mo5N8tPtaa	i'm very sorry for you..i know how you feel 6-7 months ago i was in the same situation...my situation didn't improve but i learned to live with it..u didnt tell so much about you just that you have a broken heart..u may be shy to tell it thinking we are going to judge you or you don't find your words i know how is it but in this moment the most important is that you understand your value as a woman..don't allow anyone to humiliate you...you deserve to live like a human...respect yourself means go out, smile, met your friends , see a good moovie this will make you feel better...i know is sounds kinda difficult and it is difficult but try..if you continue just crying you wont resolve nothing but you can go mad(i was about)  wish you best of luck -if you can please say more about your story , in this way we will help you more

(:|`|GBr9YngTaa	It can be, but if you have a low budget than both people in the relationship shouldn't expect too much from another. It's not about gifts, it's about the time you spend with one another.     It goes with all relationships, that it depends on your income to how much you should spend on the other person. If you haven't had a girlfriend or haven't for a while, it will seem like a lot at first because you don't usually spend money on anyone but yourself. Both of you should be understanding about the budget.|`|BL9CQgcAaa	its tru and not worth it for long term serious relationship it is you just wana fu** her lol cos u get it over and done with quick|`|kc6PPehHaa	not if your gf really loves you, she wont need u to buy her expensive things, she would love u for u|`|G3RnxAyyaa	You shouldn't have to buy your girlfriend stuff like that!|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Just have her pay her share for the dates, and don't buy her jewels and junk.

SEifPqWlaa	I agree...    There's really some demons in the world now in days...    Stupid a**holes...
AA10863966	Here you go:  Under Alaska Statute 25.05.261(a)(2) 1, anyone can perform your marriage ceremony, including a friend or relative, if they first obtain a marriage commissioner appointment from an Alaskan court as authorized by AS 25.05.081.2 The person should be 18 years of age or older, and does not need to be a resident of Alaska or the United States in order to perform the ceremony.     from this site which has more info and instructions on how to become a marriage commissioner  http://www.state.ak.us/courts/comm.htm    My understanding is that originally this law came into being because there are so many rural and remote areas that didn't have a church or court, so they needed a way for people to legally wed.     Today it is a very common choice for couple to have someone near and dear to them preform the ceremony.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Online ordinations (through the Universal Life Church or whatever) are ONLY valid to perform weddings in California.    You'll either need to become a minister or pastor of an established church or become a justice of the peace.    Or you could save yourself a lot of trouble and just give a speech, toast, or blessing at the wedding, instead of trying to officiate it.|`|s7gWSqV5aa	Either become an ordained minister or shoot enough moose.|`|cmdAsz2iaa	i think you can do this online... lol. seriously, google it.|`|SiPGcBnYaa	i don't know but Joey did it on Friends so it can't be too hard|`|OR1nkXhDaa	Google it, I did and now i am a Priest!

It was insane - some people call it "socializing" psh whatever that means, right?! Get her screen name somehow and do not make it look like you are a stalker - even myspace comment her. Based on your spelling I do not think you are that old of a person...?

You do not hate him either or you wouldn't be so angry.    Don't worry about what he does...concentrate on YOU and YOUR anger right now.  Being bitter and angry won't make it better...he will love that.    It takes too much of your time and you are giving him power over you by allowing him to take so much of your time.    Be with friends...find things to do..when he comes into your mind BANISH him from it.   It takes work..but eventually you will do it automatically.    If you see him...just smile and say hi and go on.  You can confuse him and diffuse any situation with a smile and a hi.  He wont' know what you are up to.    And listen....finding someone to replace him to get even is not fair to the other person you involve.  You should get into relationships because you care about someone....not to get even.  You are being dishonest and uncaring when you take someone's feelings and use them like that.    Please don't hurt someone to get even...it isn't worth it.  Take your time and find someone else that is nice and appreciates you and someone you won't regret later.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Go ahead and cry for a while. Then get angry and complain to your friends. Then get sad and regret breaking up with him. Cry some more, then time will heal it. Those are pretty much the steps.|`|BWgV2xSZaa	Get a hobby and watch a lot of mind numbing tv. Eventually he will be in the back of your mind|`|qpln6o9Yaa	We all feel like our break ups are the worst ever because it hurts so much. Don't hate...it only brings you down. You obviously made the right choice so go out there and find a great guy!! This jerk will become a bad memory. Good luck.|`|0VqNMJQFaa	A couple pieces of advice:    1. Change your mentality. If you constantly think it is the "worst break-up in history" (and I'm pretty sure Henry VIII's wives have claim to that title), then it will only make it worse. Think positively. You are rid of a guy who was playing games and hurting you. Be glad. Move on.    2. Four months is not that long. My boyfriend and I have been dating for over four months now, and while at that point you begin to get very emotionally attached, it's nothing compared to a break-up at six, eight, ten, or even twelve months.    Good luck.|`|mOxVL0luaa	like ppl says falling in love is the happiest moment and breaking apart is the most painful moment. live with it just mindset urself that u aren't the most depress ppl in this world and ohh spend time with family and friends is good medicine.  and go on a vacation with ur friends/ family too could work. smile always!|`|mLUm0tllaa	Go out w/some girls do something fun. Go to the movies hang w/some of your guys friends. Ignore all his emails/texts/phone calls. If he plays games you can ply your own 2 times better. If you don't want him in your life, don't let him...|`|JV0i77uiaa	Good for you.  It's a good idea you did it now instead of waiting longer.  It's going to hurt you but at the end you will be glad.  Write a letter and keep repeating to yourself, I don't love him over and over.  Every time you think about him get up and do something.  Go with your friend who reinforce you.  He is playing game with you right?  Now you don't answer his call, don't ask for him, don't spy on him and don't let any of your friend come and tell you anything about him.  Make a prayer every night, it's work.  God bless you and I hope you will forget about you.  I know you will.  Thank God it's was only 4 months.|`|QOU5DtFGaa	Binge eat, it solves my problems. :)|`|UTGDIOsOaa	hate is a strong word|`|oUFDH0Ztaa	get another person in your life. enjoy time with someone else. dont just sit around bored cause thats when things start processing in your head..|`|f4x7V1sZaa	f*ck someone else..|`|AA12275607	4 months....and it's "the worst breakup in history"?|`|iCKkOWI7aa	shopping|`|AA11278326	take a vacation with some friends. also maybe start doing online dating then you will start looking into other options and you wont keep thinking about him.     seems good to me|`|5fjbNeVNaa	Actually...Romeo and Juliet topped it.

Communication is key in relationships and if you feel silly trying to talk to him about it, then you aren't mature enough for a relationship.|`|2XTkSV4daa	That doesn't sound like the worst break up in history to me, but I know how you feel. You need to get involved in lots of activities and talk to your friends about it, but there comes a point when you just have to move on. I know it sounds hard but there's nothing else you can do and he doesn't deserve you anyways.|`|JmJvtTK0aa	try two years and there was nothing wrong and breaking up ... and then complain|`|1k6UUC8qaa	listen 4 months is nothing ignore him when he gets stupid he just wants to bother you remember you were here 4 months with out him you'll be the same 4 months after him even now don't pay attention to him he is trying to get on your nerves|`|NiO0qTEzaa	It's good that you dumped him and took the chance with that.    When I dumped my last boyfriend I was totally ready to do that, but he wasn't, and he kept asking me for reasons, following me, telling me to take him back.    But I was completely over him.    So ask yourself; are you completely over this guy? Or do you still have a little thing for him and that's why you can't stop thinking about him?    To get him off your mind, definitely do something that requires you to focus your whole attention on that task. It will get better, I promise. Keep looking on the positive side of life, and all will get easier!    Good luck :)|`|EjjuQ1Llaa	sounds like you still like him|`|9d8fcdffa7d53f57d979b841d6a7a622aa	u could start looking into other guys, breakups are always hard.|`|JbdNFTj0aa	Tylenol PM, just sleep it off.|`|6ad0f5a3a4041e74a28d21fd97b9a114aa	find all the pictures you have of him and light them on fire...twice|`|MqoQiLcuaa	don't talk to him again.

HOWEVER  If you find yourself repeating the same patterns over and over again.  Same kind of guys, same problems, then e-mail me and I'll give you advice from there.|`|BRYkcp62aa	I was dating a girl for close to 4 years an she broke up with me for no reasons. I got over it by just staying busy wit my close friends. I rarely stayed home, unless i really had to, but even then i worked on my home work, rearranged my room, and played fetch with my dog.    Another good girl way is to give yourself a little make over. Like gettin a hair cut, dying your hair ((even if it is temporary dye)), heck even gettin your nails an a pedi makes you feel hot. That is just my method. I really wish you luck though ^.^|`|m0tYIG2Jaa	I think you should get with one of his friends and when he see him act like you really like him. Act like he's not even there. Look the other way.( And I do mean the other way). If you know what I'm Saying best of luck. Just Pretend He isn't there and he will Just get jealous. Trust me My ex did that too me. And after a while It Goes to our Head. hope this was Helpful
C72xMgl4aa	if she wants this relationship to work, she will wait. let her know she's not obligated to wait for you, but, you like her enough to want her to.   hope this helps. =]|`|rCXogxNbaa	Really???

JK. Well theres not really much you can do. Try really hard to find her and talk to her.|`|mbn1PmdBaa	Ask her if she wants that to work or not.  And to be honest.  Even if it hurts you.  Because she might still wanna work it out.|`|vQmb8XZPaa	dont break up with her... what the heck.. she likes you.. u like her.. dont break up because ur car.. like.. ah i could scream.. she isnt going to wait for ur car. .she wants u now|`|wWN4UbH2aa	You should keep that feeling to be realistic.

vjmXiIfnaa	Your spelling is atrocious.|`|XbsuY1ogaa	Get a lot of lubricant, water/soda, and put a tv in your room just in case.

sebhK7r7aa	Hey, I was just wondering, would you like to go with me to...|`|yGwda7wPaa	It would be alright to say that.  But, I would suggest giving a specific idea.  For example, I was thinking of going to dinner and a movie on Saturday night, would you like to go with me?|`|HCWkdk4naa	that has always worked on me. good luck|`|qGAxn3H2aa	eh babii... so u wanna go wit me?  -acr|`|mLUm0tllaa	Be simple, don't try to hard,  She should like you for,you!  So she'll say yes if she wants to.  Don't be afraid of getting a No, every guy goes through alot of those to get a yes :)|`|0VqNMJQFaa	There are many appropriate ways to ask a girl out:    These won't necessarily make you two a couple, but it's pre-dating courtship, to see whether or not you two work:  "I was thinking about trying out this restaurant I recently discovered.. would you like to go with me?"  "Would you like to go see a movie sometime?"  "You know, I was just heading out to the park for a walk. Want to come?"    These are the questions you'd ask to get a girl to "go steady" with you:  [the simplest] "Would you like to be my girlfriend?"  "I've really begun to like you over the past couple weeks.. would you like to go out with me?"    There are so many variations, just style them as you'd like. I personally prefer a guy with proper grammar and who is chivalrous. Take into consideration what you think she'd like, and then act upon it. The worst she could do is say no ! :]    Good luck.|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	hey, do you want to go out with me? yours works too|`|TN8UwkjEaa	just say we should _____ sum time    kik it  chill   go out  do something  hang out|`|aZKgs79Naa	Be sweet, and do it in person :)|`|srfZDygNaa	idk almost on the verge of creepy? i guess it depends on the tone you ask it in. be completely casual, dont freak her out. good luck :)|`|WQONdh1Laa	Those are good.  But girls LOVE it when you're creative.  Like if you really like  her make a t-shirt and all over it in washable marker write random words. (INCLUDE WASH ME)- then in the same color but sharpie randomly across the shirt spaced out write "will you go out with me?" so when she washes it, she'll be overwhelmed and shocked.  that's if you really like her.  think of something original and creative!  and DON'T ASK IN FRONT OF YOUR FRIENDS. she might get pressured and uncomfortable. good luck!|`|yNGBLvVRaa	Hmm. Well, I doubt you should say the usual line "Wanna go out sometime?" because that's way overused! Also, it's helpful to definetely MAKE SURE they like you back! It will save some embarrassment! Don't sound like a player though whatever you do! Try doing something out of the ordinary! Girls love to share their stories and often feel PROUD of how they were asked out! So don't make it TOO casual like a text message or just by randomely going up and saying "wanna go out with me?" Though of course if you know this person REALLY well that might work! Hope I helped atleast a little =)
K2QwEM4raa	If you think she likes you ask her if she can go skating,zoo,fishing, etc. something fun and with people around so she doesn't feel like it's a date. You know just hanging out. Treat her like a friend, no passes, hugs, kisses, or tell me your problems stuff. Just chill, and if she likes you time will tell. Start out as a friend!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Ask her out but if she says NO then NO means NO!|`|xA1uSaZPaa	You should wait.    Apparently she does like you and you like her but the thing is that she needs time. Try not to rush her, it'll show that you are understanding and patient.|`|HCWkdk4naa	go slowly with her.  she doesn't want to get hurt.  if you start acting really flirty trying to get her attention, she's gonna think you're like that with all girls and then she won't be interested.|`|sY1itvPkaa	Well just take her out on a couple of "dates". And get to know her more. Maybe she'll get more comfortable with you.|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	Respect her wishes.  If you really like her,  the best is to go slow do not put pressure on her.  Call her occasionally, talk about common issues and not to touch on her break up.    You do not want to be caught on a rebound as it is not good as both of you may end up hurting each other.|`|f4x7V1sZaa	if you really like her... tell her that you want to date her but you will wait until shes ready.  She will respect you for it|`|YNj2i2Inaa	Just slowly but surely get "touchy feely" with her.  Put your arm around her and listen to her feelings and so forth.  One thing leads to another.|`|h9xKfbVKaa	Let her heal..When she gets over her past expirience then if she likes you she will be more willing to go out with you.But if you asker now and you know she doesn't want to be in a relationship then your just going to make a fool out of yourself and get rejected!

AA10065812	AS A REMINDER TO ALL SINGLE MEN SHACKING UP WITH A WOMAN.  UNLESS YOU LIVE IN ARIZONA OR CALIFORNIA, YOU HAVE   NO (English/Spanish/Italian);  N-O;  NEE (Dutch);  ?? (Arabic);  He (Bulgarian);   (Japanese);  ASSUMED RIGHTS TO, OR SAY ABOUT, ANY CHILD BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK.  ONLY THE COURTS CAN GRANT YOU ANY RIGHTS.    I REPEAT, SINGLE FATHERS IN 97% OF THE U.S. AND ITS TERRITORIES HAVE NO RIGHTS.   YOU ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE, BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNTIL YOU ARE GRANTED THEM.  SINGLE MEN MAKE THESELVES INTO A SLAVE CLASS THAT MUST ASK PERMISSION OF THEIR SLAVE OWNER (THE MOTHER) OR HER LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE (THE COURTS) FOR PERMISSION TO SEE YOUR CHILD.  AND EVEN THAN, 60% OF THE TIME, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT STUDIES, YOU WILL BE DENIED ACCESS TO YOUR CHILD, LOSING ALL CONTACT WITHIN FIVE YEARS.    YOU SOLD YOURSELF INTO SLAVERY THE MOMENT YOU TOOK YOUR PECKER OUT OF YOUR PANTS WITH A WOMAN YOU WERE NOT MARRIED TO.      I've worked with divorced and single fathers for 20 years.      You have an up mountain, not hill, battle ahead of you.  In a word, prepare, prepare, prepare.    Get an order enter forcing a DNA test, unless one has already been done.    If one has been done, go to the child support enforcement to setup a voluntary order.  Wait for them to file against you will result in you paying all court costs.      Take a certified parenting course.  The court is going to order you to take it anyway, so by showing youve taken it only looks good to them.    Start keeping a daily journal of all you activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      The court will order you into mediation, so take the lead first.  Instead of hiring attorneys, go to a mediator and try to hammer out an agreement.  A mediator is an attorney or paralegal with certified training as a mediator.  You each have to pay half the fees in order for the mediator to have the appearance of being unbiased.    If you and the mother are civil, consider Bird Nest Custody.  In this the child lives in one home and each parent live there for 3-4 weeks, than switch.  You live with friends, family, rent a room, etc. on the off time.  In this manner, your childs life is not disrupted.  They are not being shifted back and forth.  They keep their own room, friends, school, etc.  It is hard on the parents, but than the child comes first.  This is the form of custody rocker Ted Nugent had.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...    A couple of additional   http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/|`|AA12081834	Technically..she has "physical custody" the child has been living with her.  My suggestion is to petition the courts for joint custody and visitation orders..she will most likely weed you out...and you may never be able to see her...the longer you take the harder it will be... and make certain that the visitation guidelines are followed.     I know a guy who has two children with an ex-wife....she stopped letting him see the kids when they were toddlers (4 and 2) ....he let her get away with it for awhile...when he tried to get visitation several years later....she fought tooth and nail....she's vindictave....she repeatedly drags him to court for child support wanting increases, etc...but refuses to let him be part of the children's life...they don't even know him..it's sad really.|`|W07vMTQvaa	You have a right to see her daughter and you need a court order to reinforce it.  If you don't do this, she will slowly make it more and more difficult.  You don't have to ask the court for custody, just for ordered visitation that she has to abide by.  Good luck to you.  You sound like a good father.|`|gxSDSpUkaa	What is the last name of the baby. Whoever shares her last name has full custody now and that isnt made up, its law. No last name, no courts, no child.|`|yVIb7zjiaa	You need to go to court regardless if your working or not .She does not have the right to keep your daughter from you.|`|JRV8gHbkaa	go to court. If your not working, seek legal aid. You have every right to the child. Be prepared to pay child support though. Stop complaining and do something about it. I did and now my kids live with me 24/7 and she pays child support but I am yet to see anything from that and its been 2 years. What I am saying is get off your deadbeat asz and do something about it.|`|AA11705364	You have every right to see your daughter.  Speaking from experience, the mother will get custody but more than likely it would be shared and the courts would determine the days and/or nights. Unless you guys go through mediation, where you both decide on what days would be better for the both of you.      It's best to leave the courts out of it.  Keep trying to be the good father you say you are.  Remind her of that fact and what she's doing will not only hurt you but your daughter, in the long run, as well.  She needs to grow up and realize you are trying to be a father and not a problem for her present relationship.    If worse comes to worse, maybe a day in the courts, just to show her reality, maybe a good idea.    Good Luck!!!!|`|krrUQvjFaa	The best thing for you to do is go to court to petition for at least visitation. It's not a fun process but it's worth it in the end, especially for your daughter. The longer you let your ex do this the harder she'll make it for you later and the harder it will will be for your daughter to develop a relationship with you. You seem like a very good father. I wish my ex was. Some people might say to keep the courts out of it but the longer you do the worse it usually gets. I've seen it happen to my family members. Do what you have to do to be a dad to your daughter.
el8yX5q3aa	Unless you are sure of a relationship you shouldn't pretend it will be ok.  It is dishonest.  You will be using him until something else comes by..and that is not fair to him.  Like you...he deserves someone who can return his affections in an honest and genuine way.  It is so humiliating when you are with someone and you find out they were TRYING to like you in a romantic way....you  would feel like a charity case and feel betrayed.    Tell him you really cherish your friends and you are happy he is one of them.   Nothing else needs to be said...you are friends...you can't force a relationship.|`|Ksilu2Zyaa	So are you lesbian???whats the deal.|`|vlEeaB4baa	I wouldn't do anything right now.  Just chill out and see if he asks you out.  Go out and don't worry about the "title" you guys might have. Just have fun, that's all that matters.|`|RlPeaD8Qaa	give him a chance. if it doesn't work out, just tell him. he'll appreciate it more. just trust me.|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	I wouldn't confront him about not being interested. It's not like he told you directly, as you said. It would be very awkward for you to go tell him you don't want anything, when he never asked you for anything as of yet. And if you don't like him in that way, don't push anything. If you don't like him, why would you give him a chance at all? And I wouldn't break all ties with him either. There is no need to. His feelings will probably fade away after a while, and it's not something you should lose a friend over. Just let things be and see how things go. I'm going through a similar situation in my group of friends also. On Halloween, me and our whole group of friends had a movie night as we don't celebrate Halloween, and we were watching scary movies, and I was cuddling with him. Well, I didn't see him in that way but he developed a crush on me. A lot of people kept telling me he liked me, and supposedly he talked about me a lot to them and he began acting differently. But, I kept being friends with him even though I didn't see him that way and we're good now. I think once he realized I wasn't going to change even though he had a crush on me, he was able to resort back to normal and deal with it that way. Good Luck Though!|`|ItleV9qeaa	well most of the time dating ur friends never last long and the result is often the same u stop talking because it becomes awakward   just talk to him about it and explain u see as a bro and thats all|`|uHTpBjWDaa	Well do you want to give him a shot or just be single?    I would choose option A.|`|EQyOBeomaa	well sweetie i know it's tough and your just a sophomore but think about it try to go out with him in just a few minutes like a coffee and see if you would like to pursue it or not don't confront him it will make him uncomfortable with you  and maybe break the friendship that should be treasured|`|oyS3Ra27aa	Ok, your situation is exactly like mine. Not even kidding.    Except I'm the guy, and hypothetically you would be the girl.    From my situation, I would want you to confront me about it, tell me how you feel, then give me a chance.    Like wow. Your situation totally describes mine. Sheez.|`|PD9x9Oioaa	i think u should give him a chance but keep going out in groups to avoid anything awkward happening.the worst that could happen is that u don't like him as a boyfriend and then u could still be really good friends, if u ignore it then u will ruin your friendship for sure. hope this helps
aSjdL4heaa	A large percentage of women can't have an orgasm just from straight intercourse.  The trick is to learn how to get a woman off without using your penis at all.  Once you've done that, then you can use your techniques either as foreplay or as post-play on women who can orgasm from intercourse and those that can't.  Either way, you'll have happy women.    As far as learning these techniques - there are several approaches:  a) An older woman is great, if you can find someone who is really    experienced, gentle, and willing to teach.  b) Porn is a poor way to learn unless you watch something like the Nina Hartley educational series - otherwise you'll be learning what some guy thinks looks good on the screen and not what women like being done to them.  You learn creative ideas, but not technique.  If you do watch porn try to get porn directed by women.  c) There are actually seminars where you can go to learn.  Look for workshops on Tantra, especially.  d) There are always books on the subject.    The most important thing is to learn how to connect with your partner - to tune into them and be sensitive to their arousal, their movement, their sounds, etc.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	If you even have to ask this, you shouldn't be having sex at all.|`|xgWf3SKxaa	take viagra|`|savPsYWjaa	Sex partners like when you pour ketchup in their hair.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	that would be something you ask the person you are with. ask them what they like and try doing that.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Make faces while you are doing it like OHHH, YYEAAHHH, SPEED|`|AA10453678	practice practice practice. by yourself if you have to. but not so much you go blind.|`|AA11278326	how do you know it's avg size. have you compared it with ppl's ewww?|`|XbsuY1ogaa	Go to Border's bookstore, they have a ton of books on the art of 'making', and you can read them in the store and not have anyone bother you.|`|VWO9tW5eaa	tell her you want to *** on her back. then splash lotion on her back. after she turns around thinking you're finished, drop a load on her face.|`|YWIKJ9s8aa	wow like all i care about it size|`|5ocCUojWaa	well im 17 and ill tell u wat i do  u have 2 star off by some 4 play u know kissing playing with the breast fingering   then u go in dont go in so deep when u start   some ppl keep there penis in and keep going in deeper   but try taking it out completely and then putting it all the way in   try diffrent positions   different places   it add to the pleasure|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	I TOTALLY agree with Johnny Web.

I don't know about your past relationship history, but if he is with you because strictly because he expects "favors" of you, he is not someone to be with.

It is a strong connection of the soul. When you are in love you feel a strong emotional bond that is stronger and more intense than anything you have ever felt in your life. Almost every time you see this person you are overcome with happiness and if you had a bad day, just the presence of that person will turn a bad day into a good day.|`|d607be78b22052655b29d90f0342ca59aa	true love has no limits and may come at any age,and when it does dont let it loose.|`|AA12165010	Mature enough|`|259237f9ca2de0c9e7a26cf59608f992aa	u   can  be   any   age   im only   ten   and  im   in  love|`|1c3d2d01b87f96edd46163a01d8e797baa	love knows no age|`|AA12066289	no age limit|`|AA11555370	It's not about age; it's about maturity. A 35 year old man might not have the brain capacity to love a woman like she deserves to be loved. And vice versa. You could be 14 and be a perfect gentleman. It's all about the mental capacity of the individual.
AA11081201	No, you could take control baby!!|`|d265ed7514a0780cb9ce1a6805709dfdaa	i luv being xcontrolled|`|AA12235541	i love to be manhandled, tied up, or whatever most of the time.

That's why i am seeing a director (of a local TV station).  :)|`|983dc08a05f3dfd738eea5479ff3f09baa	It's good to be directed sometimes, it's easier to learn what your man likes that way. Also it's always a turn on to be with a man who takes control of the situation.|`|66655cac4ccc55a73e54115d895845b0aa	Depends on the guy. If it's a casual thing-sure what do you have to lose? Try starting while you are making out or sometime during foreplay to see how she responds.Be sexy about it.. If it's a girlfriend who needs suggestions-- bring it up outside of the bedroom first,so she doesn't think she is doing something wrong,and then bring it up again in the bedroom to remind her of whatever it was you wanted to try. If she's not used to "taking orders" it's not a great idea to just spring it on her.
AA12042975	I am pretty sure if you ask him to clip your toe nails then he will either     1) Laugh  or  2) Shove his broom or mop up your butt    Make sure you wash your feet first in case I'm wrong about this.|`|AA11941852	I think you're an idiot.    BTW, while you're up come wash my feet, punk.

AA11171092	LOVE: when u feel in your heart that you'd truly do anything for him/her. You want to make them happy!  CRUSH: when u just wanna bone or make out all day everyday!|`|f6fa0309a2e1f37721821ebad11c6817aa	have sex with them.    If after you ****'em you still wanna be with them, maybe it's love, otherwise it was definitely a crush!|`|739fea0d2fa1fc37428406b2d0728f71aa	how do you know that they are different?|`|cd68d6f4c65b52b4667b7f4c3d4919ecaa	If you have to ask the question, you already know the answer.|`|a481df7d42ac83fcdf165791103ab09eaa	How to Know if it is a Love or a crush Is Mierly simple when You look upon the person you find yourself with urges to know him or  her do You care about him or her do you care more to get to kknow him or her. above appearnce and such? ask yourself tht above all pray to God and ask him that|`|AA11869515	crush is when he makes your heart jump everytime he speaks. Love is when you have been through some things together and worked them out and he still makes your heart skip a beat|`|AA10785723	Love is an undeniable passion. A crush is infactuation because you think this person is so great, but then you see someone cuter and like them too, sometimes at the same time as your crush.|`|333e2db702ab1a6bd53e076c75c5954eaa	Love is the product of what is left after the "Crush" is over, and the crush will eventually end over time.  What is important to ensure is that you are right for one another as the physical aspects of the relationship will ultimately tapper off.  Ask your self this question, Do I love him because I need him or Do I need him because I love him.  When you can answer this question without equivication or any doubt you will know the truth.|`|AA11883231	you actually don't know, but when Mr.Right comes around that's all you think about, dream about and the other little thing that you guys do together that makes you happy|`|AA10008995	Just think for a while...  what ur heart says listen to it|`|d3422f90292b41c6fdbdf6ff86da20adaa	If it's grape or orange and very sugary, it's probably a crush. Seriously, if you want said person just to satisfy a thirst (desire), think crush. If you honestly would do things to make that person happy it's probably love. Doing things to make a person happy can include going away. Would you be willing to do that to make the person happy (This is hypothetical, I'm not saying to do this). Just a thought.|`|c3825a1cfb23077d84254715b437c2afaa	Crush is when you're in a state of idealism. You really don't know the person that well but have some idea of his/her personality and/or you are just attracted physically.    Love happens when you know the person at a deeper level and you both connect at some level. Don't throw the word love as if its something that you can find everyday. You love someone when you believe in his/her potential and you want to help him/her self-actualize. You are happy when s/he is happy even if it doesn't make you personally happy. For example, s/he gets her way instead of your way.|`|AA12306815	well if its a crush........ you would be flat as a pancake....... if its love..... who knows......
AA11921320	I notice you say 'when'.  Where is your heart in relation to the brain now? I guess once you find your love surrounds your brain, your thoughts will be wise and compassionate.  You should probably ensure express routes exist for feelings and thoughts to make passage from the suburbs to the city complex and back very rapidly.  If your brain is a wireless city it would be good if you extend the wireless capabilities into the suburbs.|`|AA10783586	U'LL REALIZE U WERE NEVER A GENIUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12051777	sorry i can't answer i have no brains lolzzzzzzzzzzz !!  plz return it to me !!!now i will keep it in the locker !! you brain stealer !!lol...............|`|AA10136007	always keep the combination of both
AA12349394	catnip toy|`|77725ca3f5829c618ab868b82d222c0baa	The main things kittens need are toys. If there is a lot of space for the kitten to play then an electric mouse that runs around the floor is a blast. But if the space is limited look for a toy on a string that they can hang on the wall and he can sit there and bat it around. Another gift that is good but not fun is a Scratch pole. Kittens can really tear things up that they are not supposed to. If he has a pole hopefully he will destroy that and not there couch. Good Luck|`|1a69b8aacd22374321528fd39fbd9a61aa	the best toy i got my cat was a fuzzy spider on a string with bells... bells help - they love the sound!
AA11982028	Cat: That's an awesome site! Another great site is a Yahoo group called BirthAngels: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BIRTHANGEL... You probalby know some of them as they are on birthmombuds too. It's a great site mostly of birthmoms but there are a few Adoptive parents, like myself on there.  I know I love it there. I've learned so much. They are totally birthmom friendly!   I admire you for your decision! Hope to see you join soon!|`|AA10105819	I've never heard of sites for mothers who give their children for adoption, but it's a wonderful idea. It must be very hard to do this, and I admire you for doing it. I wish everyone who couldn't take care of a baby for whatever reason wouldn't kill the baby, but give him/her LIFE and a home where they can be properly provided for.    Good for you!!!|`|AA11284466	NOPE BUT I THINK THAT IT IS A GOOD THING.  BUT WHAT DO U THINK THE KIDS WOULD THINK IN THE LONG RUN?|`|AA10637767	I don't know of any other sites, but I would like to thank you sooooo much for choosin adoption over abortion.  I have so much respect for people who value human life.  I wish you all the best in your search for the right family to adopt your baby.  My friend had her baby in an open adoption sitatuion.  This is a great option if you still want to be a part of the baby's life, but know that you can't take care of the baby.  My prayers and best wishes are with you!!!!!!!!

Don't hold her past faults against her, and never use them to get back at her if the relationship doesn't work.  If you trust her now, and believe she has moved on, why not give it a shot.  Take it slow, let her know you trust her.|`|1762a8a39a38a0c42f7d5f21cb8f388faa	I think you should start dating and don't listen what other says (because it's your life and totaly not about others)!!!|`|AA12262255	Take it REALLY slow.  "Used to do some bad stuff" ten years ago is different than 10 months ago.  Ask yourself why you really like her.  Is it because she's kind of a bad girl, but kind of safe now?  If so, RUN!  Why don't you find girls who haven't done "bad stuff"?      People can change, but they don't change very quickly.  If she's been into serious drugs, then she should be in a program of some sort.  If she isn't, RUN!  If she's in a hurry to use the "L" word, RUN!  If her family is into a bunch of "bad stuff", RUN!      Otherwise, take it slowly, learn everything you can about the kinds of "bad stuff" she was into (go to the library, a few hours of internet research).  But most of all, listen to yourself really closely.  Make sure you can talk to other people about your relationship (if everyone tells you she's bad news - RUN!).  If something feels wrong, don't do it just so she'll like you.|`|ecfccbd5952ec2a71b15f547635ff863aa	sorry for you  get a life and gforget about girls|`|182bc4d9cfade988f93d64710074d36eaa	IM GOING TO BE REAL WITH YOU. YOU CANNOT TURN A WHORE INTO A HOUSEWIFE.|`|AA12392274	Just date her if you both really like each other. If what people think has an affect on you, then you can't say that you really like her.. Because if you liked her, you wouldn't care. If you know that she has changed then thats all that matters, take it slow though. But don't worry what people think.   Would it be different if you were a year older than her??? It shouldn't matter who is older, as long as you like eachother...  Just make sure that if you do get into a relationship with her, don't use what she used to do against her. Or trust me, it wont work out...

cad1dbed51989ba1e1a8207909a9a8f6aa	Infidelity:   While dreams about cheating may be very common for married people, it rarely means that your spouse has been unfaithful. Infidelity dreams may simply reflect concerns that youre not getting enough quality time with your partner.    http://health.msn.com/centers/sleep/arti...    Cheating:  Dreams of a partner cheating are common in relationships. If no concerns about betrayal or infidelity exist in waking life, the dreams are a sign of insecurity on behalf of the dreamer. Have you been feeling depressed or unattractive lately? You may be worrying that your partner will find someone better. If your partner has been unsupportive, you may be feeling betrayed. Is their attention drifting away from you?     http://www.dreamdoctor.com/dictionary/ch...|`|AA12317258	i heard that those kinda dreams actually mean that he really loves you.     good luck!

At times our dreams may not represent a direct action, but more of a fear as well. Just sit down and talk to him about it, try to be as honest as you can be regarding the dream and hope that he does the same. He may not be cheating, but just talking about it with him might make you feel better. Good luck!

In this case, I would be "dreaming" of a girl who would maybe become a supportive wife and a loving mother of my children.

He can hire experts, afford expensive attorneys, and even buy judges.    Sad but true -- it happened to me.  My x "legally kidnapped" my son for 4 years, and when he was finally returned, he was a different (emotionally damaged) child.  I hope you have (or can find) the money to fight him -- because it will most likely be longer, nastier and more expensive that you can imagine.    May God bless and protect you and your children in this difficult time.|`|88a9f90034d031ae7e6363f1b6148a23aa	You need to see a lawyer.

AA11666630	awh. i understand your situation.    my parents were really REALLY strict about me having a boyfriend. finally when they let me, they are strict about what im aloud to do with him, and make crazy rules. weve been going out for over a year, and they're still on our backs about everything, however, i think you've been taking your relationship at the right pace. i personally think you should stay with the guy. tell your parents that your taking it slow. tell them that you understand your limits that they have given you, and you have made limits for yourself and how far you would go with this guy.    good luck|`|AA11435910	The worst part of being young is having to follow your parents rules. If it is meant to be he will wait  a couple years for when the parents will let you date.|`|AA12392274	Talk to your parents about it. And tell them that you will take the realtionship really slow and tell them how important he is to you. But keep an open mind and listen to what they have to say. I have been in your shoes, and the best way to handle it is tell them and listen to what they have to say. Don't scream and yell. Be calm about it. They just don't want you to get hurt...|`|30dfd8238ba44c97f7446784ec0150aaaa	well if you really care for this guy, then you should be with him. i mean if your parents do not like him, then idk. but just give it time, i mean let your parents see how your bf is(attitude, and ****.) but just as long as you know that he know's how to treat you then good. at least you two are taking things very slowly, and get to know each other better. and you have the choice to listen to what people say about you being to young to be dating. just dont take your parents lectures to the heart and to personaly. because, your parents are just worried for you, i mean have you heard about what is going on around the world? just be careful, and enjoy life! but always remember you have to respect yourself, and respect your boyfriend! but if you need someone to talk to then just e-mail me at sports2rhyme@yahoo.com or teddybear2006_2007@hotmail.com|`|AA11626235	you should talk to your parents and if they really don't want you going out with this guy then you should put your family first. that does not mean that you have to completely ignore him. maybe you could make a compromise with your parents about how if you will stop going out but maybe they would still let you hang out with him. good luck!|`|f7e5c1d1870c0bed9611aa1da6f481a7aa	I really think you should listen to your parents.  They have experience in this area and believe it or not they are only out to do the best for you.  Why rush into a relationship?  You will have years and years and years to have a relationship.  Why not just be 14 and enjoy it.  Seriously, is there really a need to rush into a relationship?  Do you think that over the next 30 years you will never be involved again?  I'm here to tell you that you will have many many boyfriends.  The only regret you will have is that you didn't stay young just a year or two longer.  Good Luck.|`|baaf1b7855f42696e5c3e86c219d43daaa	There is very little we can say that will change anything for you. we can offer advice of how you should handle situations but chances are none of the advice you get here is going to be what you want to hear. But I shall try.     One you never mentioned your boyfriends age and yes this plays a big role. if he is under 18 then it is legal for him to be around you. if he is older then for one it is not legal and he could get in a lot of trouble. I will play this as he is closer to your age if not the same.   Your parents although may seem to be acting unfair are you parents and know you better than anyone ever will. Not only that they are also the law makers in their household and people you should have the highest respect for after all they created you and raised you. Their main goal is to protect you while your still under 18. By disobeying their rules you only make things worse on yourself your 14 in a few years your going to be 18 and then the rules change when you move out and you can set the rules you live by. I fail to see the rush. If your afraid your boyfriend wont wait for you can you honestly tell me he is worth giving your heart to.   your right love knows no age but it also respects life which is full of do's and don'ts no one says you can't love this boy they are just saying now is not the time to form a relationship.   You sound like a very smart girl and I can tell by the way you posted your question that you seek understanding and knowledge.   I think you should follow your parents advice and dont take your relationship to such a level that it becomes phyiscal and holding holds and kissing is physical. keep that love intact and allow it to grow inside you and when you have your parents blessing then move forward. You are only young once dont rush it.|`|AA11320481	rap don't suck, your mom sucks d*ck lil B*tch!

e5396816bfb3621440889b7272bbf91eaa	The only way you can really know if your best friend likes your boyfriend is if you ask. Since you to are best friends you can ask and your friend can tell you the truthful answer (bestfriends don't keep screats from each other). And if she says yes she isn't your best friend at all and she is a plaier since she has her own boyfriend(that means your friend is a female dog).|`|0bbb6ebb0f56ad3ed24c2d4089883fe3aa	Dummy, learn to spell dating.

Besides, if they are just talking they might be planning some surprise for you.
df85f95e322e40287a2524ee2c837b96aa	You can't make someone MADLY in love with you. You can't force romance down his throat. That will just make him feel like he can't please you. And if you do manage to force him to be romantic, it won't be as nice as if he did it himself. Stop trying to talk personal matters while he is out of the country. I bet you have been fighting about stupid stuff too. Here is a hint. Stop thinking about your husband being gone every second. Get a life. Treat yourself to a visit at the salon, if you can afford it. Stay busy. Maybe plan something nice for him when he gets home. Not too much though, maybe a favorite food or a simple well thought out gift. And remember, the guy just traveled internationally, he will be tired. Don't expect romance or sex.   Inspire him to treat you well. Tell him you love him and that you can't wait for him to be home again. Appreciate and notice when he says or does something nice. Do occasional special things for him when he is home- give him a backrub. It doesn't have to cost anything.   Above all, stop nagging the poor guy!!!  P.S- just read your little post script.. Have you ever thought that he is a workaholic because he wants to be a good man and support his wife and kids? He works because he loves you. Appreciate him for it!!!!|`|AA11200878	Don't try talking about important family things when he is in public, and can't talk fully without everyone else listening in...

When he gets home, give him  tiime to get back acquainted with the kids, and you, then have your talk with him. Do little things you know he likes, and be patient with him. He will come around, but it might take a while to happen. Good Luck!!|`|2b7f1c8907a5e5f2a5dac04bc69bf375aa	How long has this been going on? Becaue of the kids? Has someone else caught his interest?

Talk to both of them. Tell the one that you dont like as much that you like someone more or something to that affect and if he really cares about you he will give you some space or be a true friend to you. Spare his feelings. And for the guy that you like...ask him how he feels about you...mainly if he hates you or not. Depending on his answer go from there.|`|f83c45169874834fda4f642991afcfabaa	your question is a little confusing. But, ask the one that you think hates/ likes you and you will have your answer.

AA12084524	wel i think she lied to you because you she didnt want to hurt you or thought she would loose you.  I don't think thats cheating as you guys only started dating and it was too earlier for her to know where that relationship is going.    I would be gutted tho and know how you feel> It really sucks but what can you do?  If you like her and she has been faithful since, forgive and forget and move on with your relationship.  FYI it probably took a lot of courage for her to tell you and i dont hink she did it to spite you!|`|AA10727617	must admit, it would bother me in a weird way. eventhough it wasn't official, it would still feel like cheating to me.     i always said what you don't know won't hurt you. clearly she had no reason to tell you. what good has it done? maybe she wanted to hurt you? if you want to 'clear your conscience' you would be honest straight away. a good person who genuinely cares about you would not wait, could not wait 7 months to come clean. their 'conscience' wouldn't let them!!|`|AA12334997	i would be more annoyed the fact she lied to you rather thatn the incident itself.

AA11903993	I would leave the ball in his court to call you when he has time. But I would keep looking.  It's kind of suspicious that he doesn't pick up, or that he can talk for hours on the phone but doesn't have time to see you.  He might not be that into you.

You should talk about it with somebody that you are comfortable with. I learned, over a long period of time, that talking about my feelings help me get over it. Death of a family member: talking about that person and how they did this and that made me cherish the good times and learn to love and not grieve. Best to you.,|`|AA12293512	I know that it's about preference, but you have to be STRAIGHT and look for a man. Forget her, i think she's straight. She doesn't want to get so close to you bcoz she doesn't want you to make her lesbian too.|`|AA12312300	You'll never really get over it, otherwise Life would be too simple. This experience is a part of you and you need to remember it. Now, for the healing part, it just takes time, and lengh depends on individuals. I'd recommend rum jelly, a bit of music in the bath. then get out, grab a starbuck and walk through your city with your Ipod on. you'll eventually find it relaxing and you'll may be able to smile at someone again.  Keep an open mind girl, Life carries on.  Wishing you the best.|`|368afa250318f52acf9259f5531e5d72aa	I am very sorry to hear that. I have a best friend that was in the same boat and her gf for 3yrs left her for someone else(it is like right when she gets attached is when they pick up and just leave her high and dry w/out ever looking back) and she let her rub it in her face for about 6 months until one day I told her to wake up and smell the roses. I took her out and had her meet new people and now she has new friends. No she doesn't have a new gf but NEW FRIENDS that CARE about HER. So in other words YOU NEED to GO OUT and MEET NEW PEOPLE and as hard as it is try to forget about the past and look into the future. Try to always remember that when one person knocks you down there is another one waiting there to help and pick you up. I hope this helps... If you want to chat anymore you can email @ dolphin02529@yahoo.com :)|`|AA12354934	hey  dont take it too hard man. don't worry, things will get btr.  believe me time heals alot of things. i know its hard tryin to forget sum1 like tht.   so u just take it easy, and well, there aint no rules to get over sum1. one day it just hits u that whatever it was, its over and u can't change it.   so just keep her in the past, and get on with life.|`|ab3e962588683c880c1b71baebdaf7f7aa	Jerk off to Gay Porn and save your *** shots in a jar and give it to her for her birthday
AA12066778	Yes.      There are girls living in Orlando.  There are also men, women, and boys.  Not to mention cats and dogs and lizards and alligators.    If you are trying to MEET girls from Orlando, you should probably try getting out and mingling.    Hope this helps!
AA12391978	ok, it's gonna take some balls but do this:    just walk up to her and start talking to her.  Say you've seen her around and thought she was cute.  Believe me, what do you have to lose?  Think she's going to make fun of you...the only thing she's thinking is that she's so flattered you think she's cute.      If you dont' want to tell her she's cute, just start talking to her about ANYTHING!  Talk about the princple or the class you saw her in.  you'll never get anywhere with her, until you establish youself as a friendly guy.  Be interesting, unique and laid-back.|`|AA11644565	Be direct...girls hate it when guys beat around the bush, if you like her, tell her! or at least be really nice to her, don't tick her off by being immature, because then all her friends will make fun of you.
AA10690370	Operation Boy Trap    Stage 1:  Have one of your friends to tell him that you like him.  When he knows that you like him, he will pay more attention to you and notice you more than before.    Stage 2:  scope out all information about him.  The more you know about this boy, the more tools you have at your fingertips.  Use the information to your advantage.  If he's crazy about Eminem, get an Eminem sticker for him to stick on his locker.  If he's crazy about a video game, then play that game at home and talk about it when he's around to hear you.  If he's a whiz in algebra, ask him for help ("I heard you're awesome at algebra.  I'm so dumb I got a D on the last test.")  Also, giving him little compliments like, "Hey, I like your shirt" goes a long way.  The idea is to make him appreciate you appreciating him.  You get the idea.    Stage 3: as he gets accustomed to the attention that you're obviously showing him, he will want to talk to you.  Don't be shy when he approaches you.  Try to talk in a natural way.  If you run away because your heart is pounding and you're blushing like mad, he's not going to be interested.  Keep it under control and talk to him like you do to everyone else.      From this stage, if you guys continue to talk to each other and he likes your personality and looks, he will definitely want to know more about you.  Ask him simple but practical questions, like "Did you see any movies lately?" or "That Mr. (teacher's name) sucks.  What do you think?"  Keep everything happy and casual.  Then the ball will be on his court, and let him take the next step.    You can decide then if you really like him or not at this point.  Good luck!|`|7b2d13f05b9473a0799e505b6c0351dbaa	Spend more time on your classes and education than boys.  You already can't spell school.

You could say-Hi- my name is- then ask him if he could teach you some about what he likes because your brother or Dad are always too busy to explain things to you. But be yourself- not a put on cause it'll cost you later.

3c2a33571b3df5811e8a5185cac9d4d6aa	I would let her know where you are coming from. It also depends on what level you are with this person. Are you married? Girlfriend? Dating? In any case, you should let her know where you are coming from and that you want to come to some kind of understanding on how you are going to resolve the issue.     P.S.    2 wrongs do not make a right. Communication is key here. Talk it out.    Additional Details    1 second ago  Our relationship is very good because we communicate and everything its just sometimes she says the wrong things and I let her know . . . . eventually      My response: It appears as though she is not to sure how to communicate her feelings and in turn says things that hurt you. She also could be saying these things because she is unsure of how you feel so she is trying to get a REACTION out of you. SHE NEEDS REASSURANCE. Communication is still key.|`|AA11622143	Maybe go for a different girl. Im sorry 2 say.|`|AA11056477	my boyfriend let me talk and say that you thinks you hurt me but you hurting your self too so think before continue cause if one day i decide that it's over do not ask your self why if we really want things to work between us stop been stupid and be mature for once but if do not thing that your relationships it's not going further broke up whit me|`|AA12038699	maybe she dont know how to show her true feelings and when she does the wrong things always come out!|`|a1e23d1f4d96a0f6d31551d11d0c7c32aa	tell her about it...don't be rude about it.  But you have to let her know.  If you love her, then you should be able to be open and honest about what you feel.|`|e2ad38ab5b523b90f9c44d2d8c83857eaa	Move on. If this girl is always hurting your feelings then let go of her. You don't need to be put down. You deserve someone who will make you feel good about yourself.|`|e1fa8f2144f482273bce2df7ec1b5aa4aa	tell her that it hurts you and ask her if she is ding that cause she likes you and than her that you love every thing about her so pick me as best answer|`|e8de8ea043a0015b105d2bb3e68befcfaa	well there are many approaches to this problem.  It all depends on what kind of guy you are.  If you are not scared to talk about it, just walk up to the girl you like and tell her about it.  If she does not know that you like her then tell her and maybe all that will change.  you never know the outcome.  I have had both things done to me.  guys come up to me and tell me about it or tell me that they like me.  Works either way and the outcome could be different|`|AA12144070	Let me guess... She's stubborn, hates to admit when she's wrong & tends to lead her needs over yours?. Honestly, she's never gonna change and no amount of talking will change the hurtful things she has said & will say. Talking to her may halt her words for a while but my guess is she says them to get a reaction out of you, because it makes her feel better knowing you're hurt. Try, but I would seriously consider letting her go. You'll find someone who deserves you.    Just because you are "dating & in love" doesn't mean anything. You don't need to make excuses for her ignorance.|`|AA11322886	Maybe she is just scared and don't know how to show her feelings and stuff like that|`|AA11918331	You should tell her how you feel. Tell her you really don't appreciate they way you are being treated and if she doesn't change then maybe isn't going to work. Good luck.|`|AA11625772	Let her know and start doing what she's doing give her a taste of her own medicine

AA11108250	Its a new way of thought created by a man named L. Ron Hubbard in the 50s and 60s. Its purpose is to make you think you can be your own God and have powers that the normal person does not. To reach that "God" stage which is called the "CLEAR STAGE" though you have take hundreds of classes and spend about $300,000 to $400,000 just to reach it. I am not kidding. I know because my first year college roommate was in Scientology and I actually took one class. I ended quitting it because it is a total scam and they actually try to brainwash you. It is almost freaky. I never felt comfortable when I took sessions of the class. I literally hate it and can't understand why so many people fall for it. Its complete bullS %t. I can go on but won't. Hope this helps.|`|AA12042146	somekind of religion|`|AA12236823	Some men in their hearts don't believe there is a god. With a longing for god and acknowledging there is no god, then they create a god by putting an emphasis on good qualities they can attain. This is a belief that since there is no god, you can be good like a god. They add a lot of psycho-babble and procedures in order to reach this god like state. Once you are like a god, then they feel they have reached the highest perfection they can reach and they try to get others to be happy like them.    TX Guy|`|AA11469687	its a scam, try Buddhism|`|AA12011957	I have been a Scientologist for nearly 5 years. To me it makes agreat deal of sense. It deals with issues related to mind/life with a clarity not found elsewhere.    Simply go to the website www.scientology.org to find out your nearest Centre and try some basic/life improvement Courses. That will convince you of the effectiveness of Scientology.    The first thing you usually do in Scientology Organizations these days is "Purification Rundown". It is not unduly expensive and it induces a clarity of mind that is out of this world.     Try it. It really works.|`|AA11949102	It is all about science and teleology.

AA12315388	no. When people think and say things out load often enough, things may become true to them and their listeners - and of course it will probably become a problem for you too in the end.

Why should you not be allowed to enjoy a natural request from your body without having to compromise on other areas of yopur life that you are not really interested in sharing or willing to share at the moment.    It is very natural to desire someone else or more than one partner and wanting to have sexual relations with them.    Religion has nurtured into our minds that it is wrong, that we need to get married to do it and that you are dirty if you do so.  This is to have a controlled society, but it does not mean that they have the right to impose it and claim that it is a moral obligation.       As long as you do not hurt any feelings or encourage in any other way someone that might interested in sharing feelings, go with it.    Just remember there are diseases nowadays so protect yourself or your chosen partner.|`|d493538f5903cc0e1141fd7d13f825faaa	i dont think so im in 5 of those right now. until i find a chic i can have a relationship with.|`|AA11579760	No, it means your getting what you want and that to me is an accomplishment!|`|afcab095b59e965d0415916ee030e118aa	nope|`|8b331f6f543fdf3c3c0127f235cc3865aa	Yes, that is pretty much the definition of "cheap". You are giving something special and intimate about yourself away in a tawdry manner.    It is unfortunate, because you are worth much more than that. You are a special and unique being, created for a purpose by a loving God, and he wants much more for you than that.

It is not matter of being cheap or not (you can always go t another town and no one will know about it so they will not call you cheap), however it is to do with your value system.    I would NEVER do it.. I would prefer to wait to have solid and commited relationship. In fact with those AIDS stories today, it would be not matter of being CHEAP or SLUTTISH but simply VERY STUPID. (and in eyes of religion you must be married, so then no one questions your morals)|`|430b95b874dfd7e614771edb89955760aa	If you are asking this question then it means you are in your own mind.  So I would think twice about it.

It really depends on the situation and NO you're not cheap for doing it. If it was with 7 other chicks I would say so but not just with a friend.|`|AA12292782	It all depends on how you look at it. If it's only for sex and you both agree that there will be no hard feelings if the other partner ends up finding someone then - wait a minute! You two need to grow up! There are innocent people out here looking to find a life-mate and you two are grinding it out as if you haven't a care in the world. With this, you run the risk of carrying your attitude over into a potentially productive relationship. If you do you'll run the risk of hurting someone who loves you for you and not for the freak-fest that you also bring to the table. You know there's more to life than just sex!

Too often, men lead women into the valley of "committment" knowing full well that he really just wants to hit it and quit it. Keep doing what you are doing and don't fault yourself if someone catches feelings because at least you warned them.|`|e38ed73577d1a3cabc8a76c16091092faa	Heck no as if that is what you choose and there is no problem between the 2 of you for doing so ,  why would it make you cheap.  Now if you charged for it, then maybe, but giving to the needy is not cheap.  It's very thoughtful .  and well appreciated, i would guess.  Don't feel cheap, feel you are donating to a geat cause,   and remember what you give   out comes back 10fold they say, so be ready for the time of your life someday as you will get it back in return , only better.

This tells you that I received hard whippings. I've desided that whippings only make children harber resentment. If you want a loving relationship with the children leave the disapline to the biological parent. I speak from experience because I had a second marrage where my first child was disaplined by second wife. This caused him to resent me and her. Please for Gods sake don't put those children through that. Hope this helps you.

AA12167219	Just because he hasn't talked about marriage doesn't mean he doesn't love you.  Each couple takes that marriage step at a different time - it might be a year or it might be 5years.  If you are feeling that you are ready for marriage then you should talk to him about it or at least run the idea by him to see if thats what he wants too.|`|AA11109123	Guys have different timelines in mind for marriage.  My wife and I dated for about 2 years.  She moved from one state to another with me.  We then lived together there for just under a year and I proposed to her.  I wanted to live together and see if we were compatible.    She had expectations that I would give her a ring when every major holiday came.  As the holiday passed, she would suddenly get visibly upset with me because I didn't match her expectations.    Don't be obsessive about marriage.  You definately need to talk and just see if that is what he has in mind and that he is serious about you.  While women are usually interested in getting married and getting on with their lives, men usually like holding on to the non-married part of theirs.      As soon as the ring goes on the girls finger, a whole bunch of issues start coming related to the wedding....planning the wedding, religious classes/conversions, what flowers to get, types of cake to get, who to invite to the wedding...etc...etc...  For a woman, this is extremely exciting...for a guy, it can get overwhelming and stressful.    I'd try and get a sense of where he stands on the issue of marriage and roughly what kind of a timeline he might have in mind or what he needs to know in order to be comfortable with the thought.  See if he is in alignment with your thoughts.  But don't let things drag on and on.  One of my great buddies was dating a girl for like 10 years.  She wanted to marry him, but he wouldn't commit.  They lived together for about 3 years.  She left him.  I don't blame her.

Hope I helped some!|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	its dont matter what you look like or what u can by her.. some times personalities or the way someone acts is all they need. maybe she likes his personality better. to me you seem a little self absorbed no offense.. just some dont like that trait.|`|350cef9d036413e03f4a0846a1ff7930aa	Play a think called "Aloof" but be aware of what you are doing and don't let it go to your head.

AA10953250	Don't get over this guy without him knowing how you feel! The love boat only travel to your shores once and it may never come back again. Get up the courage and tell him how you feel =)    Or maybe a friend can do that for you, and let her tell him how you feel. OR if you can be really sweet, just tell him yourself. If he doesn't return those feelings, at least you can rest assured that your feelings are finally being shared =)    All the best!|`|b9e17f1222430e55dd4de26ca13cde6caa	Call him and invite him to the gallery. Make you two a couple. Say,      "My friends are meeting at the gallery, and I was wondering if you and I could meet there too. I've wanted to get to know you for a while, but just haven't had time to call."     He'll either say sure or no........but if he says no, see if he wants to do something else....maybe meet for lunch somewhere where you two can talk for a little while......    Good Luck|`|AA10213441	Okay, you can either:    A. Call him and tell him how you feel  B. Do the gallery thingy  C. Never tell him. Never know if he really did like you. Never know if you ever had a chance.     I think we can decide not to choose C....|`|9e4d573e8e4286116066f04d59807e0daa	how will you ever know if you had any chance. dont let it go by. take the chance you only live once.|`|c0e9bdc3580a6b1aa6aba4eb36a8364faa	call him. he may be the one. i lost the one for me and don't want to see it happen to anybody else.|`|AA11981714	It'll only be your loss if you dont do anything.   Put up (not out!), or shut up. What's the worst that can happen? How long till you forget about it?|`|AA11458367	throw the number away.  If you and this guy were meant to hook up, you will eventually.  But for the moment, forget about him and enjoy the summer.  Open your eyes and mind up to other people that you may come across thru the summer, like a guy at the local swimming pool or at a barbque at a friend's.    Life is too short to spend time worrying about things that we have no control over.  Your at an age when life should be filled with crushes and friendships.  You are just starting to find out what you really like and what you don't like so much in people.  One of these days one of the guys will go past being a crush and turn into a real boy friend but you have to be open to the possiblities that are out there waiting.|`|719308ed7eed4211a77c712e76c1cf99aa	I think that you need to call him and tell him exactly how you feel. The only way to get that out is if you can explain to him. Tell him why and how long you've liked him. Invite him to go to a movie or on a date sometime. I doesn't hurt to try. Chances are though, you probably won't see him much anymore.|`|c0cca8d12ec69fb5453416065b41fa61aa	you should call him and get to know him because if you don't your going to go your whole life wondering what would have happened if you did approach him.|`|bed0f11f2e0b8347e59934935bc6341faa	what you should do is call him the worst he can do is say he doesn't like you then you would know. But the more you wait the more hurt it will cause you|`|AA12126768	Forget about him. Don't make an idol out of a man who isn't even old enough to marry you and do all those wonderful things for you that you desire. Don't make an idol out of men period. Men have limitations. Worship God alone.
AA12269421	It's not easy, just try to not think of them.  Go out with friends, go exercise, just don't sit around and think about it.  Eventually you'll find someone new, but don't force it or try to make something happen right away.|`|dc4a0236150e86e97657dbad999568b0aa	Its easy to advice but u ve to face the tryth . The best way is to remember all thost times that made u miserable and usd. Think that ur precious life is not for soe1 influencing u so much that u will live ur entire life just thinking about them.    Instead u should b happy that u will be away from thes negative energies when u let go of them. Ur life will be much more beautiful without themwhen there r no complexes about ur rejection as afriend. These people will never change their attitude. So GO AND SHOW THE WORLD THAT U DO NOT NEED ANY ONE FROM NOW ON.I M HAPPY THE WAY I M.bELIEVE ME I T WORKS.|`|0bddcc41b67fe7027d014eb65473bf87aa	Well that's pretty obvious. If they're not showing any interest, they probably are looking for a way out of the relationship. For the break-up, note a few things they've done to piss you off and times they've let you down. Tell that person how you feel and that you're not feeling any progress in the relationship. If you see no future in it, don't let it go any further - you'll just hurt yourself and your friend.|`|0bbb6ebb0f56ad3ed24c2d4089883fe3aa	You only have to do one thing; MAKE A DECISION!!! Do you really want to stay with someone who doesn't care about you? Be honest and tell your mate that the relationship is not going to work.
2e004fce7dc732498502fb65874a5701aa	you need to sit down in a neutral place with him and discuss the situation in person.  perhaps the relationship can be salvageable, but are games really what you want to play?  honestly, just talk to him and stop playing the games - both of you (ie: throwing things around, him calling exes, etc.).    on a side note, your parents usually don't like a boyfriend for a reason.  most parents know what is good for you so you should at least consider, if not follow their advice carefully.  my mom has always been right...|`|fe27e112941a1bcfa5129d17e5336cf1aa	well i think its about its time|`|AA11213749	YOU NEED HELP, ONCE YOU HAVE SEEK THAT HELP LET HIM GO, IF HE HAS TO CALL HIS EX TO MAKE YOU P.U.O THEN HE'S A LOSER GO ON A DATE THAT WILL BURN HIS ***.

AA11725008	Yes I am afraid so. It can seem like the two of you are made for each other but on the other hand not. He or she can be the greatest person but sometimes they can also make you very unhappy.|`|AA11396296	Be true to yourself and happy with what you have...|`|4c997890ed94edba3cf6c1a7d4bf678eaa	yep i think its possible...i love my hubby but his job makes me so unhappy|`|0f4865b19aaf7c608f89d5c9f4e51ebdaa	YES|`|88a9f90034d031ae7e6363f1b6148a23aa	Yes, because your marriage is just one part of your life.

AA11228809	If same sex couples want to have a baby together, then they will have to adopt one. It's not possible to have a natural birth between a couple of the same sex (male or female). However for 2 women, they do have a second option - they can go to a sperm bank and get in-vitro fertilization. The one woman who wanted to be pregnant of the two would then receive the treatments.|`|AA11561316	well with a two girls  they would have to discuss that situation together  either adopt or have one of them get pregnant  with a guy  its kinda obvious all you can do is adopt|`|7809bf7e0958c832981903141df5c63caa	Search me.

Come on, it's a case-by-case question.|`|AA11854574	YES|`|1190744edba8a74899a99a51c34e60f2aa	I believe most women are.  I think that there are those that just want to know by feedback from other women who have experienced being with another girl and not necessarily want to do anything physically.

I think that there is a spectrum that we all fall on and  that the ends are extreme heterosexual and homosexual.  These are the ones who have complexes but I think that men and women have thought about the opposite.
