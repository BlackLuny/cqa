As soon as I throw away the naked tupperware container, I find the lid that's been lost for a month.      Do you put lids on containers before putting them away?  Or do you stack the bowls together and the lids together?  Or do you use a whole separate drawer for lids?  Or have you given up and gone back to foil?

20090223074317AAnrdEz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why does my stepson lie?	I really don't know what to do. My 8 yr old stepson lies about me all the time. We have joint custody of him and whenever we pick him up he'll go back and tell his mother all these things about me that aren't true. For instance, he just told his mom that I spanked him and yelled at him (I didn't). We seem to get along find while he's with me. We go to the park together (sometimes without his dad) and have other outings and we both have fun, but when he gets back to his mom we always get a call or a note asking why I treat HER child so horribly. His father has talked to him about the lies, but it doesn't seem to change anything. I have asked him why but he always says "I don't know" and starts crying. Then he told his dad that I yelled at him and called him a dirty liar. I'm getting so frustrated I'm to the point that I don't want to be around him unless someone else can corroborate what happened.

20090223075047AA2T7M2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Im only just coming to terms with what happened..?	Last september i had unprotected sex when i was very drunk., the next day i was at my friends, and we both got very very drunk and i ended up telling her about the night before.. basicaly i just sat on her bathroom floor for about an hour hitting my stomach crying.    Over the next few weeks i just forgot about it and was just waiting to come on my period, and on the weekends i was getting very drunk with friends. One night i stayed at my brothers girlfriends and had a chat with her about having babies at a young age (she was 17) then i realised i still hadn't got my period so i was worrying... and drinking.      Then the week after that i ended up getting paraletic after drinking a bottle of vodka and got taken to hospital. This made me realise that i needed to stop drinking.. so i did.       But a couple of days after that i rember being in bed just pushing hard on my stomach. About 4 o'clock that morning i woke up crying in pain, it felt like all of my insides were just being tangled up and i couldn't even move i was in so much pain, i just curled up into a ball and cried. I passed out for about an hour then woke up and was bleeding, but it was brown/redish and it was just like clumps. I tried to forget about it and class it of as a bad period. It was a miscarriage im sure. I kept it quiet for over a year but one day i just started crying about it thinking about how i've fcked my life up so much and i told my best friend (guy) and he helped me out a bit.   But now i just cannot stop thinking about it, it's making me upset all the time thinking about the fact i could have a child and its my fault that it sufferd because i was drinking excesively and deleberatly hurting my stomach, i was just a stupid childish girl and i feel like now is the time im paying for it.       What can i do about it now? Its as if a year and a half later is the time i've started to realise and un-block it out of my memory.   I was only 14 at the time, im 16 now.

This morning I almost keeled over at work with terrible stomach pains and have had a bloody discharge for the past few days. I was only 20 minutes into my shift but I couldn't stay for the required half for it to not be classed as an absence. I went to the doctor this morning as soon as I left work (they actually took me in a taxi along with a first aider) and was advised by the doctor this is a threatened miscarriage and immediately booked me in for an emergency scan tomorrow morning. But the fact I am on a final warning is forever on my mind. How can I prove this is pregnancy related, I know for a fact it is, and I could be on the verge of having a miscarriage, but how do work know? Everything is so black and white with them I'm incredibly worried they are going to say I could not prove it was pregnancy related and sack me when I go back. Can somebody please help me this is unnecessary stress I need in my current situation but I can't help but worry!!!!!xx xxx

20090223080010AA71mbc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	I think this is a disgrace?	A disabled CBeebies presenter has been the victim of a disturbing campaign after parents complained that she was scaring toddlers. They claimed that host Cerrie Burnell - who was born with one arm - is not suitable to appear on the digital children's channel.      Miss Burnell and co-presenter Alex Winters took over the popular Do and Discover slot and The Bedtime Hour programme last month. But the decision to hire her has prompted a flurry of complaints to the BBC and on parenting message boards, with some of the posts on the CBeebies website becoming so vicious that they had to be removed.      One father said he wanted to ban his daughter from watching the channel because he feared it would give her nightmares. Others claimed that they were forced to discuss difficult issues with their young children before they were ready. One blogger wrote: 'Is it just me, or does anyone else think the new woman presenter on CBeebies may scare the kids because of her disability? 'I didn't want to let my children watch the filler bits on The Bedtime Hour last night because I know it would have played on my eldest daughter's mind and possibly caused sleep problems. And yes, this is a serious post.'       Some even accused the BBC of hiring Miss Burnell, 29, because of 'political correctness' and solely to meet employment quotas.       One notice board comment read: 'What is scary is the BBC's determination to show " minorities" on CBeebies at every available opportunity! 'This new presenter is c*** - face facts - but because she has a disability then she was given a job. [It is] positive discrimination in my books.'      A BBC spokesman said the broadcaster had received nine formal complaints about Miss Burnell. But she insisted the new presenter had also received messages of support and that many parents were keen to have a range of people on screen.      Yesterday, Miss Burnell - who has a four-month-old daughter - hit back at her critics, branding them 'small minded' and their remarks 'terrible'. Admitting she was upset by the comments, she added: 'It can only be a good thing that parents are using me as a chance to talk about disability with their children. 'It just goes to show how important it is to have positive disabled role models on CBeebies and television in general.'      Michael Carrington, controller of CBeebies, said: 'It's a big ask to entertain millions of children every day. 'Cerrie is warm and natural and we think that in time all mums and dads and children will love her as much as we do.'      Originally from Eastbourne, Miss Burnell studied drama in Manchester and won plaudits for her theatre work before landing small roles in EastEnders, The Bill and Grange Hill. She also works as a teaching assistant at a special needs school in London.      Disability groups have fiercely defended her and the BBC. John Knight, of charity Leonard Cheshire Disability, said: 'Disabled people experience disadvantage and discrimination like this every day, largely through ignorance. This needs to change.    'Understanding disability all comes down to familiarity. The bottom line is that seeing disabled people on television should be the norm, not the exception.'       From the Daily Mail.      What do you think about this? Let us know your views.         i think its totally unacceptable to make complaints about her just because she only has 1 full arm

I don't understand why my test came out negative yesterday morning, I thought for sure 100% that it would be positive and it was such a let down. I am planning on taking the other hpt on Wednesday and if that comes out negative and still have not period then I'm going to call my doctor to get a blood test done. Do you think there's a chance I could be pregnant still even the test came out negative or do you think my body is going through something right now. I'm not overly stressed in fact things have been extremely less stressful lately now that my daughter has gotten back to a daily schedule. Also, when I tested when I was pregnant with my daughter the hpt came out positive right away, when I went tot he doctor to confirm the results they said I was only 4 weeks along and all 3 of the hpt came out with clear positives. I know every pregnancy is different but I'm having a hard time trying to figure this out. Please let me know what you think. Thanks for the help.      P.S. I just want to make sure it's clear that people know I'm not asking on whether or not I'm pregnant, I'm asking what you think. Some people on here have answered me rudely before because they msot think I'm dense enough to think that because one person types that they think I'm pregnant then that means it's 100% true.

I have heard a lot of women complain about the mirena and I am starting to wonder if its causing mine! I had a baby aug 29th... from then till about mid november when I got mirena inserted i lost majority of the weight and was doing pretty good. A few weeks after I got it I started gaining weight. I haven't changed my diet. I am pretty active you never really catch me sitting on the couch. Since I got the thing put in I have gained about 20 lbs. I have absolutely no idea of any way this could have happened because I exercise and eat healthy and like I said Im generally active. I have never gained weight like that before. I didn't even gain 20 lbs while I was pregnant. Its really upsetting me. I am also getting acne.. but not like regular pimples.. they feel like they start out that way but they never come to a head it just feels like a painful cyst and they usually dont go away for 2-3 weeks. I have never gotten those before. I don't ever want to have sex anymore. The moodiness has dropped off some but for a few months I was so miserable. I overlooked these things for a little while till one day it occured to me that maybe it could be the mirena. I asked my doctor when I was getting the mirena if it caused weight gain and he said no because it is localized but Ive heard a lot of other women gained weight. What are some thoughts?

He can say 20 words which is what the "things your toddler should be doing " sheet said he should be able to do but the ped. said that we are the only ones that can understand his speech and that she is afraid he will fall further behind by 2.

I found this on a website:      'You can only adopt a child if you are Hindu (including Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism) If you are of another religion you can only take a child under guardianship'      Is this accurate?

20090223080706AAhO6mU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do you handle criticism?	We were at my partners parents house Y/D for his birthday, and his mother made a comment about his jumper being new, which it wasn't. but it lead on to a convo about washing, and how all his jumpers shrink. it was of course all my fault. i don't do the washing right. despite the fact nothing else shrinks, and i do it perfectly well.       i then get told at dinner that my son shouldn't be eating the way he eats. he is almost 11mos, and he feeds himself. he isn't a picky eater, and eats anything (was eating some raw red onion). he coughed, and my MIL jumped up, and ran round the table to get him out of his high chair, turns to me and said "SEE! he could have choked!" he coughed fro goodness sake, and the only reason he coughed was because iu coughed, and he copies.      how do you handle criticism, and being told how to raise your child?

She's always used a sleep positioner, but in the past week she's been able to rip the adjustable side off of it in her sleep and get in wierd positions. It scares me that she might get in a bad position and suffocate or something. Are there bigger sleep positioners? Or should we just take it away? and if taking it away is the answer, how do I get her to adjust to sleeping without it? We tried this one night and she wouldn't settle...

20090223081917AAJoiOb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Mothers, your opinion/reaction?	I'm a retail manager for a girl's clothing store. We have 2 sets of fitting rooms, one is in the middle of the store and the other is in a hallway toward the back of the store.      Yesterday, a grandmother approached my part time associate and told her she found it inappropriate for a teenage boy to be standing near the dressing room in the middle of the store. So my part timer came to me and told me about the complaint. I realized she was talking about a boy and his father who were bringing outfits to the boy's sister who was in the dressing room. I had been helping this dad while he was looking.. he had asked my opinion on things and proceeded to tell me his wife had passed away years ago and his daughter is 7 and loves clothes.       I assured my part timer that everything was fine, they had a legitimate reason to be near the dressing rooms and they were not a threat. So she returned to the grandmother who was getting ready to check out and told her what I said.       The grandmother was furious. She screamed at my part timer which is completely unacceptable in my store. These girls are 16/17 years old and do not deserve to be treated like that. I went to the desk to excuse the part timer and finish checking out the grandmother. She told me again that it was inappropriate for that boy to be there.. I again told her that he was helping his sister, She said no male should be allowed near our dressing rooms, that he was making her granddaughter uncomfortable, etc.etc... I apologized for the way her granddaughter felt but explained that I cannot ask someone not to stand somewhere simply b/c of that. and that I would have been more than happy to move them to the back dressing rooms which are a little more private.. She went on to tell me I wasn't doing my job, I wasn't protecting her granddaughter and that the little boy was a pervert... Her husband decided to jump in and tell me its the same as letting a boy in a girl's bathroom.       Honestly, I just don't get why they overreacted. I understand that she may have been uncomfortable. But our dressing room curtains cannot be seen through when closed and the room she was in was in the middle of the store. Again, she could have moved. I don't feel like I should have asked that dad and brother to stop helping the little girl just b/c another customer didn't like them being there. And the couple didn't help their case when they started throwing the money thing around, the famous speech - "I spend thousands of dollars in here.. yadda yadda yadda"  (we hear that alllllllll the time people, no difference to me).... and the fact that when they left, my other part time associate heard them say that the boy was a dirty little mexican.. which made me laugh b/c he was clearly not mexican. he was barely italian.       sorry so long! but I just want to know how mothers on here would handle that situation, if you were in the grandmother's shoes and my shoes. Thanks!!!

All day it was very light, it was between colors, sometimes light pink, then brownish red, then sometimes red but never heavy. I'm using a pantie liner and that only gets a few drops here and there, mostly right after I use the bathroom, When I check my cervix my finger comes out with brownish red.

My husband and I have planned an anniversary trip to Mexico, and we are planning to leave our daughter with his parents. I was fine with this idea until their visit this weekend. Now I am a little worried.      Our daughter is 9 months old. We have started her on solids, but haven't introduced everything yet. Anyway, my MIL was really excited to know that she was starting to eat finger foods now. I give my daughter things like sliced up banana, whole wheat toast, apple, cheese...stuff like that. I also feed her fresh or frozen vegetables, yogurt, broiled meat, fresh fruit, egg yolk, cereal, etc. Anyway, we never add sugar or salt to her food, and don't feed her anything that is not fresh or frozen (i.e. no preservatives). This weekend, my MIL was insisting on things like adding jam to her toast, giving her iced cream and pieces of cupcake, and asking why I don't feed her canned peas, corn, etc. She also suggested that I should add some salt to her meat if she refuses to eat it. I am worried that if I leave my daughter with the in-laws for a week, she is going to pump her full of things like white bread, sugar, and salt. How can I stop worrying?

20090223085058AAQMH2B	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Chest pain while pregnant. Could it be my gallbladder or is it just heartburn?	I'm 25 weeks pregnant(tomorrow) and I have been having terrible chest pain right below my breast bone mostly in the center of my chest/abdomen and on the right side. I feel it in my back and arms and it sorta just radiates all over. It comes and goes when it wants and not just after I have eaten. I used to only get it now and then, but it seems it comes at least twice a day now. I've tried TUMS, Prilosec, Zantac, and the doctor prescribed me Tagamet. None of it helps at all. There is a history of gallbladder problems in my family especially during pregnancy. I've talked to the doctor, but he sorta blows me off and says its just heartburn. Before pregnancy I can't remember ever having heartburn so honestly I don't know what it feels like, but wouldn't it be more on the left side if it was heartburn? Does this sound like heartburn to you or possibly a problem with my gallbladder? If gallbladder does it sound sensible to just go to the ER since my doctor isn't taking me seriously or is it not that serious of a problem? It gets so bad lately I end up in tears over the pain. I just don't know how to handle this.

20090223084921AAxUubG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	So..... You are shopping and all of a sudden you can't find your child.  Has it happened to you?	My heart is still barely beating...  it all ended up ok but.    HOLY CRAAAAAP!!!!        First I'll tell you that my girls are 11 and 12 years old.  Not so little anymore.        I was shopping yesterday. My girls wanted to go into the dollar store  I told them to go ahead I would be  next door and see them in a few minutes.  Well wouldn't you know, My husband shows up at the same store I am in. (small town)   So anyway my girls finished, and joined us.  When we are finished shopping,  my husband said he is going to head home.   Just as my husband is yelling to me across the parking lot that HE will stop and pick up the milk,  I was telling my daughter to get something I needed from his truck, and I would meet her in the dollar store.    ~we were both talking at the same time~.      I headed to the dollar store with daughter #2, after a few minutes I realized that daughter #1 isn't in there yet.  I thought she must have been confused so I checked the store next door,      NOT THERE!  WHERE IS SHE!!   I grabbed my phone to call my husband...............no answer............call again............ no answer.  give the phone to #2 tell her to keep calling Dad until I get back and STAY IN THE STORE!     I looked everywhere,  check in with #2 to see if she got a hold of her Dad.  she didn't.      tic, toc tic toc.....       All kinds of horrible thought are flying through my brain......      What do I do,  I can't leave.  I cant stay I HAVE TO FIND HER!!!    I told #2 to STAY THERE  incase #1 came back.  I got in the car and drove like mad to the grocery store hoping my husband was still there.  He was.  and SO WAS #1.   He could see the tears running down my face and realized what had happened.  He had turned the ringer off on his phone during church and forgot to turn it back on.        This made me think of all of the people who lose their children and never see them again.  It breaks my heart!!  This entire episode was over in 15 minutes........ seemed like 6 hours!  It was just a simple case of miscomunication but I think I aged 20 years in those 15 minutes.         I will always take time to study the faces on those missing children posters. I just can't imagine living day to day wondering about my child.      **God Bless the families of missing children and let their children come home!!**

20090223084443AA4TOKJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does this sound like implantation to you? What else could it be?	I got my period on 2.14( that's when I noticed the first spotting) I got blood the next morning or over night. it was over on 2.19 On 2.20 I had my normal brown spotting "old blood day" Then my CM went to normal CM the next day. My boyfriend and I baby dance all the time throughout the month, and that's how its been for years so that wouldn't case this. I know that it is unlikely to get pregnant, right before, on or, right after ur period, but I also know ppl that have. On 2.22 when I woke up to use the bathroom I wiped I noticed light pink on the T.P so then I checked my cervix and there was reddish brown blood on my finger. Not enough to use a tampon though. All yesterday it was really light and between colors, light pink, reddish brown. When I would check my cervix that's when I would notice it the most.   Last night we baby danced and right after the spotting turned a dark red. but only lasted for a few min then went away, I got up this morning still only light spotting, I used the bathroom for number 2 sry TMI i know!!! But as I was using the bathroom I was pushed ah im so sorry, and I noticed it in the toilet when i wiped it was brownish red. Does this sound like implantation? Like i said I understand it doesn't happen often but this has never happened to me before, I was pregnant once and I did get implantation bleeding but I cant remember what it was like I thought it was my period though and I was using tampons.

I usually cramp about a week before my period is due and then very bad cramps for the first few days of period.      At 6 days past ovulation I had cramps, lasted about 2-3 days, my thighs were aching, just uncomfortable really...went to bed and slept it off.      Then at about 12 days past ovulation I got the cramps again, lasted all that evening, most of the next morning also.      I am now 14 days past ovulation and cramps are here again, lower backache too....just really annoying...      I have had a few other symptoms like slightly tender breasts, underarms especially and just feeling tired and "Off" I have had some waves of nausea too but I do get that about a week before af is due.      I don't want to get my hopes up but all of these signs are leading me to think I may be pregnant but it's been so long since I have been pregnant I have forgotten what it feels like lol.    I have also had this wet feeling down there and I have read you are supposed to be dry right before af...not sure about that.      Why am I cramping so much can anyone help? I don't want to test until I have missed my period for a few days as I hate being disappointed and it is due on or around the 26th Feb....      Thanks guys

20090223085033AAHBemD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	15 dpo! still any chance? anyone else on the 2 week wait?? need your thoughts?	I have been trying very hard to get my cycles back to normal after birth control. After 4 months i finally got my period in december, though it was light and then finally on january 20th. I am assuming my cycle is 32-36 days long. I dont temp. My period it lasted for about 1 week and was light, with on and off spotting. We have been actively TTC, i got ovulation pains on  CD20 ( i used to get these before the BC , i was on them for 2 years), then i also got some spotting on , the same week of when i think i was ovulating.      I have not had any major symptoms, except feeling midly crampish and my left breast is sore. I keep thinking AF will be on its way soon, but she is a no show and today is CD35. I tested (for what i think i am is 15dpo) and got a negative this morning with a First Response.      Should i give up on this cycle?   i hate the 2ww!!! :(

I havent had any pregnancy symptoms until the last couple of days, which are occassional twinges in my breasts, very light cramping and started to feel nausea (but no vomiting) last night and today.       Normaly when i do have AF I dont tend to get any cramping or sore breasts, so these feelings are out of the ordinary! Also (really sorry if it TMI!) about a week and a half after my last period I had a very light pinkish/brownish stringy spotting, but only saw it when I wiped and it lasted for a day.      I have an appoitment for the doctor in 3 days but in the meantime I could really use some words of wisdom from people who have/are going through this!       Really appriciate the help as I really hope I will be getting that BFP! Kaz
20090223082421AAfpTU6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Signs of being pregnant...?	I have the nuva ring, and last month i kept it in too long, but i did what they said and just continued as normal...but i'm not sure if the next month i was fully protected.  I had what i'm assuming was my period but i'm not really sure now, because lately i have been getting a lot of headaches and back aches.  I never ever ever get headaches either like really rarely.  Everyone says I'll know if i'm pregnant if I have morning sickness, such as throwing up, but I haven't thrown up since i was in the fourth grade ages ago haha! But i do get cramps and gassy (sorry for the awkward details..but i need help haha) and I have been well...getting diarrhea a little, and if not that i'm for sure using the bathroom and it's always just in the morning...maybe that's my bodies way of throwing up? anyway now that i've rambled on for ever...please let me know if i'm just sick or if I possibly am pregnant, I would go buy a test but i don't want to if it isn't even worth it! Thank you :)

20090223082757AAoidcz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Trouble With Mirena IUD ?	I have an Appt. for an ultrasound 2/24 But, I was just wondering if anyone else has gone threw this ? Severe uterus cramping,Pain on the right side,Sore breasts, sensitivity to smells,urinary freq. Etc. I basically feel like I'm pregnant, I've looked it up online and it says that this can happen. I had spotting non stop since i had the iud put in 5 months it finally stopped about 2 weeks ago. I had My annual pap at that time and told the midwife about the pain, She said i could have thrown an egg, Or it could be scar tissue pain. I really dont think that is the case because with my 1st pregnancy My Dr. really did some damage and i was always in pain until with my 2nd c-seaction when My new Dr. fixed everything, This pain does not feel the same. Anyway i guess i want to know if anyone else has experianced this, My Dr. would like to know if i want the iud removed. I'm not sure what to do. & they dont tell u what u should do. PS. I took a First Resp. Test Sunday and it was neg.
20090223082355AAlOBYm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Question about OPK (Answer brand)?	I have been using Answer brand OPK for a lil over a week. (This is my first time using an OPK) TTC for 6 months, early m/c in Nov).. My LMP was on 02/09 and my cycles are pretty short (23-24 days). I started using the OPK on CD7 and got dark control lines with light test lines (which means neg). On CD12 and 13 I got DARK test lines, but lighter control lines. I know it says if the test lines are darker then the control lines that means +, but why are the control lines lighter then when I began? We bd'd anyway just in case but do you think that means ovulation or do the control lines have to be real dark regardless? Any info is appreciated!

I have been breast feeding her up until this point.  I work full time, so I need to pump while I am at work.  For the last 3 weeks I am struggling to pump much of anything.  (i have tried pumping more to make more, I have tried taking several different supplements, nothing helping...)  I am quickly going through my frozen supply.  I am worried that I may only make it another month at most if my supply doesn't pick back up.  Can I start her on whole milk at 11 months, if I can't pump enough for her?  I will ask her doctor this, but I wanted some other thoughts as well.  I just don't see the point in switching her to formula for a month and then switching to whole milk.

I believe i ovulated sat morning, and did the baby dance every day for the last week. I am not naive i know it is way to early to tell, and i am just getting my hopes up by asking this.    SO here is the deal. My prenatals always make me sneeze (every pill does that to me) and some times make me nauseated, but never enough to up, and it always goes away after i sneeze. But today i took them, and ran to the bathroom to vomit them up, and still feel very nauseated. I have not vomited in years, so now my mind is wondering. Just a coincidence? Did anyone else ever vomit so early? I am afraid to mention this so my hubby because he wants a baby as much as i do, and i do not want to get his hopes up as well.   Baby dust to every one.

20090223094843AAoFDuf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	26 weeks pregnant and having some pain in an unusual place?	I am 26 weeks pregnant and for the past 2 days I have been having some pain in my anal area.  It is not pressure.  It is just a pain that feels like it has been stretched.  I haven't had sex in like 2 weeks (hubby is afraid and freaked out by it), and I have NEVER had anal sex.  I have not taken an enormously large poo either.  LOL!!  I mean seriously though, could it be from the baby and the uterus getting bigger and I am stretching?     Oh and I don't know if this has anything to do with it or not, but I do have yet another yeast infection and going to get medicine today.     Thanks!! :)  Hope all you pregnant women feel wonderful today!  :)

Honestly I've never felt so horrible in my life!        I'm so stressed out too - I owe my ob/gyn like 200 dollars - I lost my job so I lost my insurance too.

20090223094054AAyN93o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	If YOU had implantation bleeding, what was it like?	Yesterday morning I noticed light pink on the toliet paper. The spotting last all day. But light, I used a pantie liner and there was spots here and there. Last night We baby danced and right after the spotting was red for about 5 min then went away when I woke up this morning there was no spotting on my underwear, but when i wiped there was brownish red blood. Also I check my cervix and I have been doing that both yesterday and today and both days my finger comes out with brownish reddish blood on it.   If you had implantation bleeding what was it like in color, and how long did it last?   Also I know that it can not be my period. & my boyfriend and I baby dance all through-out the month.

I've met young parents who sound very mature, cool-headed, informative, etc. And I've met the total opposites.

20090223094204AAC89VP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Teen girl confirms pregnancy at MY house - did I overstep my boundaries?	My daughter has a friend who is 14, in the 8th grade, and has just found out she is pregnant but would not tell her mom.  I'd over heard her talking with my daughter as they were trying to find a place to discard the pregnancy kit that she could have become pregnant this last October.      Rather than just hanging out around the corner... I made my presence known and took the kit from her and saw for myself the bright red plus sign.  (sigh).  She's just a baby, herself.  Both girls were in a bit of a panic.  What was I going to do... say?        We'd sat to chat about it for a bit and she'd been terrified that her mom might kill her but I expressed how important it is for her mom too know.  I told her to call her mom and I'd take over the conversation after she dialed.      I invited her mom over and she and I talked first.  She'd been angry with me and told me I had no business buying HER daughter a pregnancy kit and then try to hide the information from her.  I'd done NO such thing except care enough about her daughter to make her mom aware of it so that she can now get the care she needs.      I think I did the right thing.. I hope I did the right thing... is there anything I might have or could have done differently?  I worry about this young girl though she's not my own.  She's a really good friend of my daughters and my daughter is being the best friend she can be in return.

20090223095503AAv7YHE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I'm a bad mom i really need help, 3yr old stress?	Ok this is going to sound bad and you can judge me if you want i really don't care i need help and i refuss to label my son as just being crazy or having a medical problem. Ok my son has a temper problem and he's 2 about to be 3 and i know you'll saying it's normal he's terriable 2's, But this is serious he's hurting my 10mos old son. And i did everything I could to prevent the whole new brother/baby thing. I let him help me with the baby, I spend alone time with him. But as I look I at him I think it's anger problems which is crazy cause he so young. But it's true he snaps some times and for no reason like when his toy breaks. As far as the hitting he's been ok i mean he still snaps sometimes and fights the kids but i been controling him. And the only real bad fighting issue with the baby was when my baby was 1st born like a month after he hit him with a toy and i took him to the er cause he left a knot on his head. So the doctors told me it was sibleing revealing and told me to stop crying it happens alot and i just have to watch him more carefully which i have.         Ok this is where it gets bad like i said he been good latley the baby 10mos now and they been sleeping in the room with us in there  own bed for the past month while there room is getting painted, And supid me put them in the bed together i thought because he was older it would be ok. But last night i dont know what happen my baby been teething so he been crying for the past 2 wks for hrs at a time so when he was crying last nigh, I get up pat him and lay back down long story short when i woke up this morning my baby had marks all over his face my oldest son was scartching him and i didnt know it. I mean i cut the night on and everything and i didnt see no marks last night(but i never thought my son would do anything this bad). And it looks bad. And it's my fault he did this right next to me but we just thought he was kicking him we kept telling him to stop and watching him making sure he laying down and not messing with the baby. I just can't believe he got that mad and did that. We went to the doctor and i was telling her i was worried about his temper she told me that he could be stress and thats how he releases his anger, there seeing it alot more now in babies. She refered me to another doctor and I'm waiting for them to call me back now so they can test him for arthtism or ADD. But I'm i the only one that thinks this is crazy. I have a fear it's me i been working two job latley trying to get a better place for us. And it's been hard my hubby (there father) just found out he has lupus and has been out of work now for a year because of this so it's all on me. This is my fault and i'm not blameing no one i'm just trying to fix this. How can i channel my son anger in a good way. Should i try sports? and is he to young for this. Please help!!!! And not we hit him we do spank him sometimes And i know some people don't believe in that and thats ok but i think there's a difference between spanking and beatings so please don't write a whole comment on how thats wrong i don't want to hear that. I'm here to change my self for the better for my kids. So if your not here to help me then don't comment.

She just started drinking from sippy cups like 2 days ago because it took me forever to find one she liked. This morning instead of her bottle, I tried offering her milk in her sippy and she freaked out and pushed away and threw a tantrum until I finally gave in and gave her the bottle. I can tell this is going to be a long hard battle. I guess my question is, do you really think bottles should be taken away at 12 months, and if so how did you do it?

I'm 13 and sexually active but I'm not stupid enough to get myself pregnant. I use protection and I'm on BC. I told my sister (who's 17 and who I trust) that I lost my virginity and she seems to be disgusted with me. A cousin of ours got pregnant at 14 and I think she's afraid I might end up pregnant too. A lot of people in the Adolescent section seems to be harsh with teens who have sex and teen mothers too. I'm sure nobody plans to get preggo as a teen. I think people should stop being so judgemental! Not all teens who have sex as a teen are whores! I'm not! It p*sses me off when people call me a whore!   Why do so many people look down upon and judge teens who have sex?

I had some brownish red bleeding for a couple days and she sent me to my OBGYN- He gave me a Trans vaginal ultra-sound but there was no embryo? So later that day i got blood work done to to see my HCG levels then 2 days later i had my blood HCG taken again. That day i went to the ER because of gall stones (gall bladder disease) and i actually started to bleed a bit dark reddish blood kind of thick.. not heavy though (and yes ive been monitoring with a pad) some very tiny almost un recognizable blood clots too. but no cramping. So he took a look and said that it was a threaten miscarriage (and ive had one b4 but it was much quicker found out one day next it was gone) So the next day i got another trans vaginal done to rule out tubular or ectopic.. and once again nothing appeared. Im starting to get nervous but on the good side he told me my hormone levels are high and rising :) but im so confused on what to think. he also said if it was a miscarriage he's see it by now. so he thinks its either too early or a belightned ovum? ugg.., i dont know. now i have to wait 3 days to see wats going on.. and my bleeding has seemed to be reducing

So my question is will the surgery have something to do with me miscarrying if indeed I'm pregnant?
20090223090830AADvq4U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Might be having really early pregnancy symptoms and DR thought he saw a polyp.?	I have always had really light periods and rarely have cramping, always very mild if any.      Last period I had severe cramping on day 2 with vomiting that lasted about 1 hour.      Then just a regular but slightly heavier period.      I never checked when I ovulate but my husband and I had sex on day 5 or 6 of my cycle. The day after my period was over.      Since then I have had trouble eating and have had cramps, nausea and just in the last 3-4 days (now on day 21 of my cycle) my breasts have become very sore and I am constipated which has never happened. I also have been sleeping in which I never have done before I always wake up at 6.      I went and had an ultrasound today Day 21 of my cycle due to the severe pain of the last period.  DR says he may see a polyp but isn't sure. Could he be wrong and this is just very early pregnancy he is seeing?      I know it would be weird if anyone else had this happen but thought I would take my chances.
20090223090936AAbEF8K	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is my boyfriends 10 year old daughter attracted to him?	I've been with this gentleman for 2 1/2 years and recently my two kids and his three have consolidated households. I've spent a lot of time with his 10 year old daughter and feel she is WAY advanced in a lot of areas. I think he is a great father and she was always Daddy's girl that got away with everything until I came along.  I get along great with her, but when she's with me and  him she's always watching our hands and if we kiss in front of her she always looks at his genital area. She barges into the bedroom to use the restroom but she like side eyes to see what were doing. Then she made a comment to my 14 year old son about seeing my hand in her dads underwear while we were sleeping and that she wondered if her dad had a big ***(penis)? My son was more was more disgusted with the fact that she was so interested. I feel grossed out and I need to know if I should tell my boyfriend??

20090223093158AAIjUaW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Pregnancy After D&C Vacuum?	I had a surgical abortion 3.5 weeks ago. I was pregnant with twins and lost them, so they used a vacuum to remove the babies. Worst day of my life! Anyways, I've been bleeding very lightly ever since the procedure. First few days were normal with a few clots and such, but still very light bleeding. I've been cramping for the past week, but no full on period. We want to be pregnant and want to try again. We started trying again two weeks after the procedure...so here's the question. If I was to be pregnant, would I stop bleeding right away? I took a pregnancy test the other day and it was still positive. I'm sure that's still from the twins though. I heard I can bleed for up to 4 - 6 weeks. I guess I expect a normal period here in the next few days. Strange that a few things I feel remind me of when I first found out I was pregnant. My follow-up appointment isn't until 6 weeks after the procedure.

My son was sleeping through the night at 1 month old, around 2 months we moved and then at 3 to 4 months the sleep ended, he now wakes up 2 or 3 times a night, we live with my mother-in law and my husband has to get up at 4 in the morning to go to work, so baisicly i do anything i can to keep him from crying and wakeing the whole house up. I realized the other day that i haven't had a full nights sleep in over a year, yes he is ten months old but towards the end of my pregnancy i was up several times during the night. My husband says that i shouldn't let him nap durring the day because thats why he thinks he doesn't sleep at night, but he has two naps at around 10 and then at 2 if he misses them he is the CRABBIEST baby i have met!!!! I am also worried that in two months i will be takeing away the bottle and this is the only way i can get him to go to bed and back to bed, during the day i have got him to take a certain sippy cup for naps but he is not haveing that at all at bed time, he just throws the cup across the room and stands there and screams.

20090223100415AAKVBrZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How can I stop feeling like a failed mother?	I answered a questionnaire a few weeks ago regarding my 2 yr old son’s overall development. Today a woman called me back regarding his results and said he passed his social/emotional but had some concerns regarding his developmental and sensory areas.       He’s going to be further evaluated next week. But this whole thing is eating me up. I feel like I failed as a parent or that I didn’t do something right. And especially because it felt like a slap in the face since I’ve never had ANY concerns with his development. Nor has his pediatrician. I’m not saying he has nothing wrong with him, because if he does, I’d like to get it fixed sooner than later. But still, I can’t help with these inner feelings that I have. And to top it off, my husband gets almost angry because he thinks that our son is fine. So it’s a double whammy!      I know I didn’t DO anything wrong persay, but how can I stop feeling this way?? I just got the call a little bit ago and it’s all I can think about. I just feel like a bad mother/failed mother.

20090223092931AA0EN4G	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Please help me, I am really scared due to previous miscarriage?	ok so i had a miscarriage in early 2007. I had started spotting brown discharge at around 11 weeks pregnant. i went to the doctors and they tried to check for a heartbeat but they didnt find one so they sent me to get an ultrasound and discovered that my baby had stopped growing at 8 weeks. shortly after having the miscarriage (about 6 weeks) i was able to get pregnant again. I now have a beautiful 14 month old little girl. Early january II found out i was pregnant again. I didnt know how far along because i had been having irregular periods. So i called the doctor and she sent me to get an ultrasound. They said that the ultrasound showed that i was still very early in pregnancy around 4 weeks because all they could see was a sac. Well that doctor said she would call me back to make a followup appointment but she never has called me back. Not only that she is not able to see me on wednesdays because those are her days off and since my husband doesnt work on wed he wants me to chedule the appts for that day of the week so he can join me at the check ups. So I called the doctor who did my 1st delivery and asked her to reffer someone to me (my previous del doc opened her own private practice so she is only in gynocology, unable to do deliveries) so she gave me a docs name and ive called her but she wont see me until i am 11 weeks. which is 2 weeks away. i am very worried. about 2 weeks ago i had terrible morning sickness, bloating, nausea, sore breat, fatigue and now nothing all that is gone. all i have now is some nausea but its from the prenatal vitamins i am taking. i am also experiencing sharp cramping along my vaginal wall and around my uterus. I am afraid i had a miscarriage again because this is exactly what happened with the miscarriage i experienced. I called the doctor to see if they could see and they wont chage my appointment regardless of my concerns. I tried calling other doctors but they wont see me till 11-12 weeks and i would like to see if the doc who doesnt work on wed will see me but my husband says he wants me to see a doc that will be available on wed. Gosh, when he said that to me i wanted to scream "yeah, just because your not the one worrying and because its not your body" he keeps telling me to not worry but I cant help it. I would just like to know everything is fine. What should I do? I am so worried. I wish I could just think for the better and stop worrying but I cant.

Anyone else have a similar experience?  How long until you went into actual labor?  I just hope this won't last for much longer....the pain is only a 2 on a 10 scale and I'm not dialated any more than I was last week which is why it's considered false labor BTW.

20090223100720AAHS9eE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	New mom-to-be needs flat-fold diaper help!!?	Hello, I just found out that we're going to have a baby! We've always planned on using cloth diapers since they are more affordable, better for the environment and of course, make for a much happier baby butt. Ive been looking into different kinds of diapers and have chosen to go with flat-folds. Ive priced all of the cloth diapers on the  market and in the long run, flat-folds are the most affordable option since you dont have to buy new sizes every few months. I have read that when it comes to leaks, you can double up on the diaper, fold the second diaper into a doubler or use a pre-purchased doubler. Moms, which method of "doubling" do you prefer and why? Also, do you prefer old-fashioned pins or snappis? Do you always use a diaper cover? If so, do you have to use one diaper cover per incident or can you re-use a diaper cover? We're trying to figure out how many of what items we will need for our baby. We want to try to stick with the "one-size" items to limit having to buy all new stuff as our baby grows. Does anyone know of any affordable, quality one-size diaper covers? Any good cloth diapering websites would also be helpful. Thanks everyone!

20090223100551AAijPKH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	My son missed a lot of school from allergy issues?	He will be sick with seasonal allergies at least once every other week and I've taken him to the doctor 3 times in the past 2 months for this issue. His sinus cold never goes away this time of year and he's 6. Well, I took him to urgent care center last night because he had gotten an earache from all the sinus stuff. The doctors there told me he should be seen by an allergist and gave me the number and everything but I call my doctor to get a referral and the doctor said over the phone that he doesn't see the need for it, but I think he needs to be seen and I think I'm going to switch doctors because I can't see an allergist without a referral. Every other week the kid is missing a day of school because of a simple sinus cold and you know they can only miss so many days before you end up in court. He doesn't like to miss school either. He's the only kid so far and he's 6 yrs old. He enjoys seeing his friends everyday. He seems to have had a cold for the past 3 wks now. Am I right to be ticked off and switch doctors? We live in Georgia so it's already nice springtime weather here. This is his 1st yr in school and before it was okay to give him benadryl and let him lay passed out on the couch but I can't keep letting him stay home, right?

20090223095306AAmBc2T	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby falls & bumps head on floor?	Ok, I know that baby's fall every day and they bump their heads on the floor, a coffe table, a toy, etc... I'm just wondering how hard of a fall is too hard.      Last night my 7.5 month baby was standing at the coffe table. I had my hand out to help her balance, but I moved my hand momentarily (without thinking) and she twirled around and fell backwards hitting her head on the floor. There was a loud thump and she started to cry.      I picked her up to comfort her & checked the back of her head, but saw no noticeable bump, redness or injury. She stopped crying for a moment and it was almost as if her eyes rolled to the back of her head and she seemed lethargic for about 10 seconds.       This scared the crap out of me because I understand that a baby's brain is as fragile as an egg yolk. This is the second time she has fallen & bumped her head and had this reaction.      She began to cry again and I rubbed the back of her head & her tummy and held her in my arms to comfort her. About 20 minutes later she fell asleep and I held my hand on her chest to feel the rise & fall of her breathing & feel her heart beating. I checked her pupils prior to her falling asleep & they were equal & reactive. When she awoke about an hour later, she was fine.      I love my baby so much & I would be devastated if something happened to her. I take really good care of her and I know I can not prevent every fall & bump, but I am having a really hard time forgiving myself and my Hubby doesn't make me feel any better and makes me feel as though he doesn't think I take good enough care of her.  :-(      I need some encouraging & helpful words of advice. Thank you!            Mother of 4 beautiful children with Twins due in Sept.

My husbands friends girlfriend is due with their baby in 8 weeks and no one has organised her a baby shower.

20090223081020AAbWBvI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My mom sprayed her house for fleas right before I came to visit. I was in my 2nd trimester?	My mom has a Golden retriever who is apparently riddled with fleas right now (she walks him down by marshes, and he goes to dog parks so who knows where he picked them up.)      Anyway, we went to visit for a few days some months ago. We spent a lot of time curled up on the couch. One day I was feeling sick I put my face to the back of the couch and lay there for hours.       Mom just informed me that she sprayed the house with chemicals the vet gave her before we got there. She said "not to worry, she researched it and it was safe." I don't know how she researched it, but knowing my mom she probably just asked a friend of hers who knew nothing about it. The house was really infested apparently, and I worry because those are strong chemicals and I know you have to spray all soft surfaces- like beds and furniture and rugs.       I'm mad that she didn't even tell me. Especially since she hasn't come down to visit once this entire pregnancy (I'm 38.5 weeks pregnant) so we had to travel eight hours to go see her. My mother in law threw me a shower last month, and we travelled 7 hours to get there, it's an hour away from where mom lives, and she couldn't even make the time to come.       I'm worried about my baby- I've been SO careful this pregnancy- eating healthy, haven't even taken a Tylenol for my sciatica, etc., etc., and she goes and does this and doesn't even let me make the decision whether or not I want to go.             I don't know what chemicals she used...I'm afraid to ask...         This all came out when she accidentally let it slip that her dog was suffering with fleas. I told her I should have my dog checked too, then, since he was with us when we visited. She said that wasn't possible and when I pressed her she admitted she had sprayed the dog and the whole house.      Do you think everything is going to be okay?

20090223094121AA8Glfe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant and being asked for a doctor's note for refusal to run errands out of the office, on foot.?	Last summer I volunteered to run errands for our office. It sort of became my job after that. I kind of enjoy it so I didn't mind.   Now that I am heavily pregnant (29 weeks) and it is icy out (in Canada), I told my boss I was no longer going to do these grocery store runs. To my surprise, she was argumentative and totally not understanding. I still can't believe it. She said "Someone has to do it and it's part of your job."   Wow. Thanks for the office courtesy...      She is now asking me for a Dr.'s note stating what I can and cannot do at my desk job.   I don't understand what my doctor is supposed to say about it. I haven't slacked on any of my duties. I work at a desk. There is nothing strenuous about it. The only I'm requesting is to no longer go out gallivanting on foot, buying kitchen and office supples.   My doctor is not the one telling me not to run these errands, it's ME who doesn't want to do it anymore. The weather is bad, my ankles are swollen, I have no balance and it takes me 10 mins to lace up my boots.   What do you guys think of this? I have a call in to HR about it. I will get the note, but I'm not sure what to have my doctor say in it.

With my daughter she was right along with all milestones and I'm thinking that my son is a little behind (normal for boys I have heard), but that small paranoid feeling is telling me that maybe he should be doing a little more about this age.

20090223090939AAFYT9c	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could it have been implantation bleeding?	my last period was jan 30th, i think i ovulated on feb 13th. we had sex on the 13th and 14th. on the 15th, i had a little spotting, only there when i wiped, not even enough to wear a pantyliner. could i have just ovulated a couple days late and that was ovulation bleeding or could that have been implantation bleeding? i have heard that implantation bleeding would occur closer to when you are supposed to get your period. to my knowledge, i have never bled when i was ovulating so i dont know what it was. would it have been too soon after sex to be implantation bleeding? we have been trying now for a year and a half and are hoping it was implantation bleeding but my period isnt due til this friday so im waiting til i actually miss my period before i take a test.

20090223100001AAgrpGR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	White patches on baby's skin?	My 10 week old has some strange white patches of skin, one around his belly button, about 2 inches long, and on his back (right above his butt), and just a very slight one on his chest. The skin is not dry, it is just a lighter pigment. He's not dark to begin with, but the white patches are very light that you can definitely see them. He did not have these when he was born, and I noticed them around 3-4 weeks ago. We were just at the Doctors last Monday and I asked about them, his pediatrician didn't know so she referred us to a Pediatric Dermatologist.  We called and the earliest they could get us in was in 2 months. So till then, I was wondering if anybody knew what the white patches of skin could be? Should I be worried?

I live with my husband, and I am on the Pill, but lately I have been feeling really queasy on and off for the last week or so.  I really started thinking about it yesterday when he was making breakfast and the smell of the bacon made me have to go outside before I actually was ill.  I have never been averse to this smell before, and at first I thought I might have just eaten something that did not agree with me.  I have been really sore and stiff for a few days, and insanely tired.  To be honest I have never had children before, and everything I look at online seems to have different information.  Can anyone who has had experience with this give me a clue.      Thanks.

In November'08 I had terrible cramping, I was light headed, dizzy, my breast were swollen, I started gaining weight and my period was 2 days late(usually get it on Wednesday or Thursday, it came Saturday), then in December I was 2 days late again (spotted on Saturday and started fully on Sunday) and same with January. I figured that my body was changing especially after several negative pregnancy tests and speaking with my gyno. I stopped taking my birth control 4 weeks ago. I plan on starting it again this month but the problem is now that it's Monday and I still haven't gotten my period. So for 6yrs I got my period on the Wednesday or Thursday of my "sugar"pills. Then over the last 3 months it has changed to Saturday. Now it isn't coming and it's MONDAY. I have taken 2 pregnancy test at home and one at the doctors they all came up negative. Many websites say that it could be wrong because my hormone levels might not be high enough. I don't want to be pregnant but what else explains what's going on? Any help?!

What are the skills you've mastered that you never thought you'd need before you had a baby? I mean those crazy things books don't mention. For instance I have mastered:   Diapering while baby is standing up!   Making any object seem like a desirable toy to distract my son from the dangerous object he really wants.   Nursing while standing, showering, shopping, walking, eating, cooking.   Learning ten variations of the word "no" so I don't sound so redundant.

20090223065329AAS8tYg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Percentile graph Q - baby off the graph?	Ok, so my daughter was born 8lb 6oz, which placed her just above the 75th line, she stayed on this line until 12wks, then gradually not immediately moved up to the 99.6th line (the top line) from 22wks until the last time she was weighed at 40 wks. I had her weighed last wk, (14months) and she was just over the graph.    Her length at 2wks old (first time measured) was on the 91st line, it went up to the 90's very quickly, last time she was measured she was 40wks and in btween the last two red lines. Then last wk she went down to the 75th line.      Is it possible for her to have fallen 25% in height in 5 months? The health visitor was concerned about my daughers weight and has arranged to come and see me in March (she was very rude actually). But I am not too concerned about my daughter weight as she has always been high up on the graph, she is a chubby baby but I am in no way concerned that she is 'fat.' I explained what she ate and the HV replied it must be the amount then.. I do not over feed her and she doesnt eat very much at all, infact I was concerned she was under-eating!      So my q is should I be concerned about her weight and also is it possible for her to of dropped that much in height or do could the measurements be wrong? (as they have been before)

20090223073442AASLmXP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How long do you let your partner struggle to comfort your baby without intervening?	Since my son was about 4 months old, my husband and I have had a standing agreement that on Saturday nights and Sundays before a holiday he has off, he'll get up for any night wakings so I can sleep. (I don't actually sleep when the baby is crying, but that's besides the point.)      However, my husband is simply not as good at comforting my son as I am at night.  During the day he's fine.  Part of the issue is that my husband is very slow to wake up completely.  He can stand in my son's room holding him but sort of still be asleep and jiggling him in a zombie-like fashion.  Part of the issue is that he simply doesn't do it enough.  I can frequently comfort my son back to sleep by leaving him in his crib and stroking his hair for a few minutes.  My husband cannot.      He's been sleeping through, but he recently had a cold and broke two teeth (8 months) so he's been up again at night.  Last weekend I got up anyway, because he was sick and really needed his mama.  This weekend he's feeling better and I let my husband try.      On Saturday I lay in bed for about a half an hour listening to my fussing baby being comforted by my frustrated husband. (Not angry-frustrated, more like helpless-frustrated.)      I eventually went in a soothed the baby, mildly irritating my husband.      Does anyone else have this problem?  Obviously my husband needs more practice, but at what point is "practice" pointless?  Obviously if I was nursing I might not have the "Saturday night off" option, but as we are bottle-feeding, the option does exist.  Your thoughts?

20090223101732AA5KhPI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Brestfeeding moms, during night feeds, do you just lay next to your baby and let them feed while laying down?	If so, does any milk ever leak out of their mouths?  The reason I ask is, I formula feed, and at night I lay with Tresa next to me in my bed, and give her the bottle.  I usually prop it on some blankets, and lay there and watch her until she falls asleep then I take the bottle away.  She always seems to leak milk out of her mouth.  Sometimes even if I am holding her.  i'm just wondering if breastfeeding moms have this problem as well. If so, what do you do about it?  Is there anything you can do about it?  Let me just state again, that it happens even when I am holding her sometimes also.  I am not looking for any heated answers.  Basically I am just looking for some common ground or similarities between what breastfeeding moms experience, and formula feeding moms experience.

20090223062119AAnFxcJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it ok to feed a newborn breast milk at room temperature?	Just wondering if I should always be warming up expressed breast milk until a certain age, or if it's okay to feed it at room temperature.       I like to give it freshly pumped, but sometimes it's not time to feed and it cools to room temp. My husband thinks we should always warm it up. I've read it's okay at room temp... But then I thought isn't he  too young not to warm it up? He is 8 days old.

20090223102908AAQeF0w	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Starting cereal but waiting on jar food?	I have been reading previous answers on starting solids, and I noticed that a lot of people have said that they started rice cereal at 4 mos and waited until 6 mos for jarred baby food? What is the reasoning behind this? My son is almost 5 mos and just had some carrots the other day and a mashed banana yesterday. He has had some rice cereal here and there since his 4 month drs appt because that's what his dr said to do. He said to start rice cereal and then move into fruits and veggies. So is it normal to wait so long to start jarred food? What did you do/or what did your dr tell you to do?   FYI: My son is almost an unsupported sitter, moves the food to the back of his mouth and swallows without pushing it out with his tongue, and LOVES his rice cereal. (He grabs my hand to shove the spoon into his mouth and gets anxious if I don't feed him as fast as he would like me to)

20090223072855AANJmwM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I feel so guilty - my toddler seems to love his own company?	Maybe I shouldn't complain, but my 17 month old can sit and play by himself for hours on end. Every once in a while he'll "cry" for me to go fetch him and play with him for a little while, but after 30 minutes or so he goes into his playpen by himself and sits and play there for an hour or more at a time. I say sit, but he's up and down trying to climb up, running around throwing his toys, etc. It's a big playpen, so he has plenty of room to move around. I only have it, because my house is full of electronics (we work from home), and it's not easy to baby proof the entire house.      He's very sociable, makes friends easily, shares his toys when his friends visit, is starting to draw and color, kick balls, etc. so I think he's on track with development... the only thing that bothers me is that his speech is a little behind. He only has about 40 words and he'll sometimes put two together for small sentences, and I'm wondering if it is because I don't spend enough time with him.      Is it normal for a toddler to be this content with his own company? Sometimes I'll join him in the living room where he plays, and he'll just run around playing by himself or bringing me toys or giving me imaginary food from his mouth.      He's an only child, if it matters... and if we have friends over, he's happy to play with the other children - in fact, he's often the one who'll go and make friends with them.      I'm just wondering if I give him enough attention? We can't go outside every day, because it's been raining almost non stop for 3 weeks now, but I do try to get him to play outside whenever it's not raining.
20090223102148AAKWHiK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How likely am I to be pregnant?	I ovulated on the weekend of the 14th.

20090223102850AAHZRPp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What could be wrong with this kid?	My best friend's son is 2 1/2. Recently his fiancee and I have been talking about this kid, Collin, trying to figure out whats wrong.      First thing that makes his mom nervous is the fact that he is almost 3 and doesn't speak in complete sentences. He has a very small vocabulary and rarely speaks. And when he speaks he'll use one word and then hand gestures so you can understand them. He can hear though because he responds to directions very well.      also, he has a severe anger problem. what REALLY freaks us out, is the kid will scream die like 5 times really loud right before he wails on you with biting, kicking, pinching, and punching. I know most kids in their terrible twos do stuff like that, but Collin always has a really weird look on his face.      is this stuff kind of normal for a young kid? we're thinking it's not. I've been looking into stuff like autism, but I'm no expert so I can't really tell if the signs are there.

My wife played basketball very well, and it would be cool to see him play that as well. I know it should all be up to him and what he likes, and I'd leave it up to him, but would it be wrong to nudge him in a certain direction? Also, I don't think I'd be able to sit through a soccer game, but I'd feel bad if I didn't. That would just be a lose/lose haha.
20090223101312AAeYX08	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anyone else losing patience extra quickly since you have been pregnant?	I was just wondering if it was just me. I just flipped out over the stupidest thing. I came downstairs this morning and rolled my shades back up to let the sun in. All day long the one shade seemed to be creeping down. I kept fixing it just to find it falling a few minutes later again. I climbed on the back of the couch to reroll it and when I hung it up it unrolled completely. I must have redid this 3 or 4 times before I just got so mad that I ripped it down and smashed it on the floor until it broke, stomped all over it and threw it in the back yard. Now that I have calmed down I think it is pretty funny. I have had issues with the shades before but I never "lost it" before.       Does anyone else have any stories like this? Can I just blame it on pregnancy hormones?

And I realised that since I had my eldest kids (now aged 6), my husband and I haven't spent a night alone.       I would love to do that! I have four kids aged 6, 6, 4 and 10 weeks. My husband and I have been talking of going to Venice for a weekend (Friday to Sunday). The problem is that I don't want to leave my 10 week old baby alone. We are also planning to have one more baby, and are planning to start TTC in about a month's time.    So basically I can't leave my baby now, but if I wait for her to get older then I may be pregnant again soon.       I was thinking of taking my young baby with me. Because I am breastfeeding her so I can't leave her. Has anyone done that before? Did it disrupt your romantic weekend too much?

I know that all of this isn't the baby since the baby is about 1/2 an inch. I try to suck in and nothing! I know I am not farther along that I thought b/c i have ultrasounds every week since I have a subchorionic hematoma and the way my uterus is postioned the dr wants to keep monitoring it.

20090223090756AAq4tKn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Question for working moms?	Amanda/Mandy/Barrys Mommy just posted a question asking if all moms should be SAHMS (didn't take it seriously). Some the answers surprised me-Some said that the only reason a mom would work is because she can't afford to stay home, and that all women wished they could stay home. I found this really upsetting and judgmental. There are plenty of women who's husbands make enough for them to stay home, but they choose to work anyways. Not all women are cut out for the life of a SAHM, nor do all women WANT to stay home.       Please tell me there are other working moms out there who work because they like what they do and have little desire to be SAHM? I know it's not just me. I'm feeling a little down now thinking that other mothers could be assuming I hate working, that I am stuck working out side the home, that my husband must not make enough money to support our family, that I'm a "slave" who hates what I do, etc.

20090223105223AANqDTA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anyone have implantation bleeding that was like a light period?	I've been TTC for a while now. I just finished my period 4 days ago. I always get the normal "old blood day" the day after my period and this month I did and then it went to normal CM like every month. This yesterday I woke up and there was light pink on the T.P I didn't think much of it, I used a pantie liner just in case, throughout the day the color changed from light pink to brownish red to red. then back to brownish red. My boyfriend and I had sex last night and after sex There was bright red on the t.p it only lasted 5 mins or so. I had a little spotting when I got up this morning. Then it turned to a little more, more of a VERY light period. and it's still like that. Does this sound like implantation to you? I don't know what else it could be?! I'm still using a pantie liner and there are some spots here and there, Also I used the bathroom..number 2 (sry TMI) and the "blood" dripped out of me. only small drops, but i was pushing.    Listen I know that it is unlikely for someone to get pregnant, right before, on or right after there period but I do know it happens. I'm not asking for ovulation times and what the norm is, I'm asking about Implantation bleeding only.Thanks!!!!! :)

My breast are sore.. like the underneath of them and they feel weird.. my nipples are a little sore too.

(Also a long time ago when my parents didn't have much money, not that many people did, that if something happened to dad, she would be out on her butt poor and have no home.)

Is there any way to make sure that it gets balanced out or for my x to at least be made to maintain a job just like I am being told that I should so that then it would be fair whatever the payments that is directed to me for my first child are.

20090223090600AAbKwxc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What to do? My  mom wants to watch my baby during the day but they are heavy smokers!?	My husband and I are planning on trying to get pregnant soon. I am a worrier and like to have everything planned out in advance, so I've been thinking a lot about what we'll do with the baby when it's born since both of us work full-time jobs (and absolutely cannot afford for myself to stay home).      My mom lives 2 houses down from me and does not work. It sounds perfect, right? Free daycare with someone who I trust! Except she and my step-dad are heavy, HEAVY smokers....since they were teenagers. I see no chance of them quitting. Everytime I walk in the house, even for a second, I reek of smoke and it disgusts me...on top of getting an excruciating headache. My husband and I both hate cigarette smoke so much and do not want our child around it and exposed to second-hand smoke as well as the sickening smell.      I mean, I lived 18 years of my life with it and I'M FINE (I think...who knows what my lungs look like!), but my main concern is the smell.      My mom has already said "No worries! I WILL watch the baby when you're at work!" but she does not know my feelings about it. I am afraid to tell her because I know she will take a lot of offense and try and convince me that it's no big deal.       We just cannot afford to spend hundreds of dollars a month on daycare. There is no one else really to do it though that I know.... I would never ASK anyone to, like my aunts, grandma or friends. I would much rather someone offer than me put them in that position & have them feel guilty.      What do I do? Suck it up and let my kid stay with his grandma and deal with the smoke? Or find some way to get extra money every month for a daycare?

20090223102432AA9eZEv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents was my sister right to defend herself in this situation?	My little sister Amy whose 16 was at school Friday and a 14 year old guy grabbed her bum under her skirt. Well she turned round and hauled off and kicked him hard in the testicles she had heavy shoes on as she is a goth.       Anyway the guy fell down and cried. Amy then shouted at him calling him a little perv and told him that she hoped his balls popped. The teacher see this and pulled her into the office by which time the lad was puking on the floor.       My parents went to the school today (Monday). The principle decided that the one week suspension for Amy is appropriate, however the boy is also going to have a one week suspension put on his record although he is unlikely to be able to return to school during the weeks suspension due to the extent of his injuries.       The boy had surgery friday and the doctors repaired his left testicle that had been ruptured, although due to the damage sustained the testicle will not be able to produce any sperm. The boys right testicle had to be removed due to it having multiple ruptures.       The boys mother and my parents have agreed that this should be the end of the matter. Amy is not happy at being suspended as she feels that it was self defense and their were people who saw the incident that backed her story up.      I do agree with Amy in the respect that the boys injuries are as a direct result of his actions and that she should nt be held responsable for injuries he suffered.      1. Do you think she did the right thing?   2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage?   3. What would you have done?   4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do?   5. Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved?   6. How would you feel if it was your daughter in this situation?   7. How would you feel if it was your son in this situation?

He tries to climb everything, pull himself up on everything and move a lot faster than his body lets him.      His favorite lately has been trying to cruise the kitchen table chairs.       He has done so many face plants (even crawling because he gets going so fast the rest of his body doesn't catch up and blam!) His forehead has little bruises all the way across it. My first was a busy baby but he never bumped his head as much as Dane does. (Or maybe he did and it has been so long I can't remember anymore LOL!)      Anyone else have a little dare devil?

20090223111742AAHiSsK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	It's quite difficult for me to understand about love?	Hello!   I hope I can make the story short and quick for you to read!    I'm 15.   Right, I am starting to fall in love with a teacher in my previous school. We met in july and she emailed me in September. It was about inviting me to a family evening. I decided to go there because I wanted to know more about people. (Well, deaf people - i'm deaf so yeah.)   I did not have any feelings for her but i feel that I started falling in love with her when we kept emailing each other in a half term (holiday.) She has to work in an office block because it is where she works when children were not in school due to holidays.   She has said many nice things and my friends said it is not my fault, i can't help with it, because she is really nice to me. She is quite professional and i like her smile a lot. That's what made me fall in love with her.   I have told my head teacher of year 11 (I'm in year 11) because i was crying at the time over that teacher. I found out that she emailed other teacher on the day she did not email me. (I know, waste of time crying over that! ha ha.) He has given me a lot of advices and helped me feel better.      I was in love with another teacher for 3 years. (She's a female.) When i got out of love with her, i felt great! But now i am in love with that teacher now, it upsets me sometime because she sent me short emails then long emails, THEN short emails.    I do like most of females! especially teachers in my school, most of them look hot! :)         Do you think it is just a crush? Experiencing love? Have you fallen in love with any one who is in same sex as you?    Sorry for any grammar mistakes, I have that problem due to deafness.

20090223111858AAKFzfp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TTC for 3 years.. found out we're not ovulating..?	We have been TTC for 3 years and due to maritial status and age doctors did not want to take us on and help us. I finally found a doctor that listened and want's nothing more but for us to concieve. I went and seen her in January and she sent me home with BBT charts and told me to start charting every morning and also to start taking prenatal vitamins. I have done as ordered. Today I called her to go over this months chart because I have yet to have a temperature over 98.1 and she informed me that if I am seeing a "wave" that I am not ovulating and I shared my chart with her and she determined that indeed we are not ovulating.. HMM! what a bummer.. So anyways, I have a follow up appt. with her in April and I am to continue charting until then and she told me today that she will then start me on Clomid. We are also going to do OPK's in March and in April, just as a back up and another peice of evidence..       I have heard alot of good and some bad stories about Clomid..      Do you think Clomid is a good medicine to start a womens ovulation process again and to help them conceive? Also what is the success rate of a couple that cannot conceive and then start to take Clomid and conceive?      I am so bummed and so desperatly want to end this journey with a happy ending..          To all of you TTC- keep your head up high.. There is hope and one way or another our determination will end in success..         Here is a link to my chart if you would like to take a look:-    http://babymed.com/Tools/Fertility/Ferti...

I went back to dc's today and it came back negative again. They then drew blood and said they would get back with me tomorrow or the next day. Hoping for the best. Have been trying for 9 months now with one chemical pregnancy that I know of. I have taken in total- 11 hpt, all kinds of different brands: 2 diff brands from Dollar Gener, clear blue easy digital, equate, and answer brand.

20090223111018AA9WuZK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why would my boyfriend try to get me pregnant?	My boyfriend may be trying to get me pregnant.  I am on the pill, but recently we have been having sex without a condom and without pulling out(not that it matters, but this just started).  He jokes about me being pregnant everyday. Puts his hand on my stomach and says oh there's a baby in there etc..  I want to know if and why he is trying to get me pregnant, or if this is just a way for him to let me know that he would be there if I did become pregnant.  Also when we were drinking one night he asked me what I would do if I got pregnant and I said "I'd get over it :)" I asked what he would do and he said "I uh, I can't tell you."  I said "what?" He said "I would be fine with it because I know that I want to be with you forever, and I would be there for you."  He probably would have asked me to marry him a while ago but he knows I'm not ready yet.  So what do you think?
20090223111421AAJIUFL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm currently pregnant with my first?	I just turned 20, I'm due on July 14th (so far) and I am just nervous as anything! The whole birthing process has got my heart and mind racing and I try and try not to think about it because I know I'll just end up dwelling on it and freaking myself out.      I go online a lot and try to find out more and more and try to find out a lot about the actual birthing process but one thing that I haven't found is WHAT BIRTH IS REALLY LIKE. Especially natural birth because that's what I'm going to do. No drugs for me.      All I've really heard is that it's going to be the most pain I've ever felt in my life... but that doesn't really help me at all. What I would like to learn is step-by-step what this process feels like. What does it feel like when your water breaks? What do the contractions actually feel like? Can you feel the dilation? What does it feel like when you're pushing the baby out? What does it feel like when they "clean you up" (the placenta and all that good stuff) I've tried finding thorough answers but nobody seems to want to share...      I hope maybe someone will come across this topic and be able to give me their experience in full HD lol.      Thanks for the time and consideration :)

20090223112001AAHxO6z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I have questions and concerns about being charged with child interference with visitation, can anyone help?	My sister and nephew are currently going through a tough and rough ordeal. My nephews dad came in to his life when he was 8 years old and now wants him to go with him on his weekends. My nephew just hates going and has now started refusing to go. The last two times he has called the cops on my sister. The first time the cops were really nice and understood that my nephew didn't want to and documented it as him not wanting to go and not as my sister keeping him from them. The second time the cop was a total jerk and accused my sister of keeping my nephew from his biological dad and documented it as that. Even though it is a total lie!! He told my 11 year old nephew that my sister is a suspect. What kind person does that? The next day a cop called my sister informing her that the biological dad filed a child interference with visitation claim against her. They told her is she receives six of them it could or does become a felony with jail time. We need some desperate help or advice or direction. This is tearing our family up. Our hearts are aching. We have tried to encourage him to go for his weekends but how can we force him to go to a family that he doesn't want or like or even want to be a part of. At first he did go but now he just hates it. It is sad because he can not even be a child, every other weekend he is there worrying about what he knows is about to happen when he comes and demands that he goes with him. Can anyone please help or direct me where I can get info for my sister? The cop informed her to get a lawyer. She is having a tough time as it is, is there anywheres she can go for legal advice that will work with her on payments. We are in the Texas area.

I don't know why this started all of the sudden...but I am 22 weeks pregnant, and every time I sit down, lay on my side, etc, I'm scared I'm making my uterus too thin/squished and having the amniotic fluid not be enough for my baby.       I guess the best way to put it, is you know how when you bring home some fish from the store, in the bag, if you don't keep it upright, it has a chance of thinning out and your fish can essentially die (because the water isn't covering them).  I know your uterus is full, while the "fish bag" isn't, but still...somebody help me calm my fears!  :)
