20090223155213AAzN8js	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Give Me Your Ideas Please?	Full Story if you want to read it:      Im 18 and was a playa before i met this girl but shes the one shes 20 and has a fiancee who treats her like crap - hits her, takes her phone off her, stops her from leaving the house, stops her from doing what she wants, wont let her talk to other guys. She goes to work sometimes to avoid him. This guy though lives with her mum and has been with her for 6 years.      I asked her a month ago did she like me she said she didnt know. I asked if i had a chance she said not at the moment i then asked was it because of x she said yes.      We text everyday and if we dont the next two days she will be like you fallen of the planet or something, we meet up like once a week or whenever we get time. Ive told her i want her, i want to take her away from it, i want the best for her that i want her to be mine and that i get so worried and upset when he goes mental at her etc. We had a big argument and i told her never to text or talk to me again she said ok vice versa and go and fcuk yourself, anyways the other day she apoligised.      She hasnt told her bf that we are talking again as she said he'd skitz on her although she said hes changed because hes trying because he knows that i like her so hes trying to keep her. I told her to have a nice weekend and all i got back was im guessing thats the last text i get from you this weekend so i text her today and she just ignored it.      Even though last week was all good and fine, i don't know what goes through her head shes shown my photo to her mum and told her all about me.      Whats she thinking? Do I give up or keep on going?      NOW how do i get to meet up with her again, espcially as i got a free house this weekend and its the perfect time to tell her everything how i feel.

20090223155308AAOIlW9	Family & Relationships;Family	Issues with mother re: my son?	I am a 23 year old woman with a 15 month old son. My mother really dislikes my partner due to some harsh words exchanged by email a few years back. She has always been very critical of me, and I would frequently end up crying after talking to her. He had enough and told her off. Maybe not a good technique, but now she refuses to so much as acknowledge his presence.       Since my son has been born, she has not visited him. He is 15 months now. She wants me to take him on a 17 hour long Greyhound ride when she is a stay-at-home mom with her own car and no young children to worry about. I am a full-time college student with a heavy course load and a lot on my plate and no car. I don't see why I have to bring my little guy on such a long bus ride. But she has made every excuse against coming here, one being that she is mad at my husband still. That happened 2 years ago, and he has many times said that she can't hold her anger at him when it's her grandson that's being affected. Tony (my partner) had similar issues with his mother and their relationship as me and mine have had, but she buried the hatchet right away and focused on being a good grandmother.      I want my son to have my mother in his life. I'm tired of her excuses. I'm tired of her not seeming to care about him. What I want to do is give her an ultimatum: come see him by this date, or don't even bother. But what CAN I do? I want her to see my son, and I want her to drop this pety stuff with Tony. He has offered not to even be in the apartment when she comes, but it's not good enough. Not only that but she's claiming to still be mad at me because I wrote in a note to a friend when I was 16 that I hated my mother... I was 16. She keeps holding these silly grudges and I don't know what to do anymore.       What the heck should I say or do? Tony is a great father and is very good to me. He has made mistakes before, but so have I. What the heck am I supposed to do about this mess?

20090223155513AAXVwOW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I deal with my lying husband?	He's very loving and caring, but lies to me ALL the time. It's not necessarily about "major" things, but he still lies to me. When I catch him, it naturally makes me question every thing he says. I'm to the point that I doubt everything. I've talked to him about it so many times, but it's like talking to my door. It just comes natural to him and he doesn't even hesitiate. I told him he had to see a counselor over it. but, he's not being very respondant to that. What am I supposed to do!?!?

20090223155712AAMLhcc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	UGHH What is he thinking...........????!?	It's a long story but I'll try to make it short!      Last year, he liked me, I didn't like him like that. Over the summer, he asked me out, I said yes (because then I did like him), we never ended up going out because we were so busy.      This year started up and it's been off and on, but in the end we were always good friends, he told me a huge secret he's only told two other people, his ex-girlfriends... and me. He was always flirting with me, texting me, blablabla.      Now this all started not too long ago, he was like "I love you! So i said I love you too!" Then he was like, Let's get married! So I said okay, (obviously were not really married.. just kind of an inside joke). Now about 5 days ago, he came to school, all emo, he wouldn't talk to anyone, he sulked around, and ran to class just so he could shove his face in his arms on his desk. So, I texted him and said "hey are you okay?" He never replied, and he still hasn't. That whole day he would just stare at me like I broke his heart or something. The next day, was a little better, he wasn't AS depressed but still questionable. He still hasn't replied.      Now today, a new week, he never looked at me, I don't get it. He looked at me once, and as soon as he did, he made this sad little face and sat there and stared at the ground...what is going on?!?? I like him, a lot, and I thought he liked me too..?

20090223160010AA5UgMp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The more he loves me, the more I freak out!?	This guy I'm dating for two weeks now had crush on me for a year & was always looking forward to talk to me and date me. He's 8 yrs younger than me I'm 26,he's 18 but he look older, mature, caring and as well as a nice person. He said he was always dreaming to be with me and can't believe I'm next to him. For Valentines day, he did a lot for me and I got really surprised since I didn't expect him as we were just started dating but he said I'm worth it..& so on. Due to his age he had lots of experiences.      I know he's very young for me but there's a good connection & chemistry. He absolutely enjoys every single thing about me and I'm getting feeling for him too. I don't see our relationship based on sex only. I can see a pure love in here but I don't think this relationship will go anywhere   My concern is since he's 18, he has a long way to go & what if he changes his mind & feelings for me someday. Can I really count on his feelings as he's telling me he loves me so much but he's too young for real love? I'm really worried about future cause I don't wanna hurt

20090223155740AA3oEAo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	No love after 50 years?	At age 50, after about 35 years of trying, I've decided I'm a freak/mutant of nature. With the exception of a few short physical relationships in my twenties, I cannot have a healthy long-term relationship. No normal/healthy woman wants me. I've done everything to make my self as successful and attractive as possible but no one wants me. I do not find life worth the effort any more. I can't solve it, God can't solve it, and no one can do it for me. It stinks. Dreams do not come true.

20090223160057AA4zwh3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why am i so mad that my boyfriend communicates with his ex?	My current boyfriend of 1 year, works with his ex tht he dated 2 years ago for four years. she is a very nice girl. Her and i have spoken many of times. However, i dont like that he works with her. It REALLY bothers me. ALOT. i cant even stress how much. Him and i spoke about it and he got rid of her. For about 3 weeks and brought her back into the work place because he said he couldnt do that to her. So my question is: if i like her and acknowledge that she is a good person and i trust my boyfriend 100% then why so i care so much that they work together? This is ruining our relationship.

20090223160430AAES5o8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What can a person do with your info if you give them a copy of your ID signed with a notary stamp on it?	The reason why I am asking is because in December my husband told me he wanted a divorce. He told me I could either sign divorce papers or I could give him a copy of my state issued ID signed with my signature and let it have a notary stamp on it. I have been trying to find answers for months. Everyone I know has told me that this isn't a procedure for divorce and that my husband may have been planning to use my ID for fraudulent activities. Any help would be appreciated. Also, please let me know what one could do if they had this information from you.
20090223160436AAwtYHe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about this?	Back ground:   I am going out with this boy named Tyler, and i have this guy friend named Michael. They are both friends too.      A few days ago Michael tells me that he talked to Tyler and Tyler said "i am only going out with her for her body. I will most likely break up with her in two weeks". So i asked Tyler If he was only going out with me for my body and he said no.       The next day Michael tells me that Tyler punch him in the back and said you are ruining my life.      Well today Michael says that he talked to Tyler again and he said the same thing he said before. Micheal then said But don't go talk to him again.      I don't know who to believe. They are both really close to me and i trust them fully.      I have came up with some ideas of what to do:      A. I could just blow it off and what happens happens.      B. I could test Tyler and tell him not to touch me or hug me or anything, and if he breaks up with me then i know he will only be in it for my body.      C. I could talk to them both together and see if one of them tells me the truth.      or       D. I could talk to Tyler and see if what he says about it and trust him.      What should i do??    I really like Tyler and Michael has been there for me so i really don't wanna lose them. I just got out of a relationship where the guy was lying to me and i can't stand having people lie to me.       If you have any other ideas on what to do please tell me.

20090223160848AAfNxyu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm Addicted to Him But He's Addicted.?	We're in grade ten. I like him a lot but am too shy to talk to him. I'm scared that I'll never get a chance to talk to him because he's always around his friends. He also does drugs- I just found out. It's so hard trying to forget him and I wish we could talk and I want to help him. What should I do?
20090223161412AA4UFZZ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How do i tell my maid of honor she is not doing what i need her to do?	she's 22, this is her first wedding...and i have otehr bridesmaid who are more willing and able to organize, etc what needs to get done...i was thinking of saying "Hey I'm going to have XXX and XXX help you out with the bridesmaid duties"...how does that sound?
20090223161352AA64lfM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Its really long but i reallllly need your help.?	ive been with this guy on and off for two yearss. we know so much about eachother and have been through soo much together. in the beggining of december we ended things cause it got too hard. (the only reason we end things is when too much is going on it our lives or distnace reasons) hes the type of guy that runs away from his problems so to get him to talk about it i came off very pushy.       i gave him his space until new years when he saw i was with another guy and flipped. we got in the biggest fight EVER. said a lot of things we didnt mean and told eachother to stay out of our lives. once again i came off very pushy and needy. i know immature and terrible of me i know.       i gave him his space since then and didnt talk to him since. a few weeks ago at a party one of his friends was trying to get with me. i said no because its wrong of both of us to do that. he wouldnt take no for an answer and he texted my ex and asked if it was okay and he didnt answer which right there shows he wasnt okay with it he was just in a bad position to answer. he finally answered the phone and when he asked hte question my ex went dead on the phone and was just like uhhhhhhh and hung up. his friend kept telling me that my ex hated me and has a new girl and all this mean stuff which in my opinion was all lies just to get me to hook up with him but im not sure. if my ex had a new girl i dont think he wouldve hesitated on the phone so i really dont know.      i texted my ex and told him i needed to talk to him but he had school the next day and was already asleep. i said i respect you want no part of me i jsut want to tell you something. (i was going to explain what happend cause i didnt want him to think i actually hooked up with his friend) well he texted me back the next day and said sorry i fell asleep.       then that night i find out he almost faught some kid that talks to me because we talk and told him to stop talking to me and if we ever went out he would make his life hell and stuff.       all this is so random to me cause i thought he really did hate me.    im so confused and i really dont know what to think or whats going on.   do you think he still loves me and cares about me?       i texted him after like 3 months of not talking today. it was during school so we couldnt text that much. i kept it casual and friendly. i said hey stranger. you could tell he was surprised cause he texted me and was like uhh but then without me answering, 10 minutes later he was like heyy so you could tell he wanted to talk. i told him how i was getting surgery and caught up very little with him. but then i texted him and said are we cool or do you still want no part of me, but he didnt answer. i know i put him on the spot. i dont know what to think i just really miss him.
20090223162336AAh65mR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is my husband so mean?	I feel like I am walking on eggshells every time I talk to him or when I am around him. We have been together for 5 years & it only seems like it is getting worse. It just feels like every time I say something to him I say something "wrong" & he becomes really mean & mad & talks really hateful to me. For example, I call him at 7pm tonight (he works out of town 5 days a week & is at home on the weekend) & I said "try to eat lite for dinner, & by lite I mean cheap b/c we dont have much money this week" he says "dont ever F*#$@ say that to me again" so I said "okay, bye". That was the complete conversation right there. I just dont know what to do, it keeps getting worse as time goes on. Any ideas?

He isn't in any of my classes either. But, whenever I see him between classes or during lunch he sort of peeks at me, and I can see him from the corner of my eye. When I make eye contact with him he looks at me for a second and then just starts talking to his friends again?I used to walk past him during my way to some classes- and now he stopped walking that way!!! Whats that supposed to mean?? Do I like scare him or something?? How can he hate someone he doesn't even know?? But, I don't want to look to desperate if I become friends with him either. My friend has p.e. the same period as him - can she do anything about it??? Please help- I have no idea what the deal is!?

20090223160933AAZUFbM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	RELATIONSHIP CRISIS! What can I do!?	My boyfriend has two best friends, Matt and Jessica. Him and Jessica used to be friends with benefits, but decided to go back to being friends. The three of them are inseparable though, and hang out whenever they have a free moment, which is basically all the time. But Jessica got a boyfriend just as me and my boyfriend started dating, two months ago. She started ditching Matt and my boyfriend all the time, and eventually I sort of took her place in a way. Matt and I are like best friends and the three of us hang out every Friday together.       But today, Jessica and her boyfriend broke up... It's going to change EVERYTHING. She is going to want to hang out with them all the time. I wouldn't normally have a problem with that, except for the fact that she has been a complete b*tch to me from day one. I feel like she will do anything to get me away from my boyfriend, and she is so manipulative and nasty that it may just work... Before she had a boyfriend they would hang out everyday, now that she doesn't anymore, she's probably expecting to go back to the way it was. I'm so scared, I don't want to lose him. So what can I do? I'm not going to tell him to not be friends with her... but I feel so stuck. Any advice?

20090223161022AAIzhO4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What to do when there are problems with a friend with benefits?	So there is this guy and he used to like me this summer and we hooked up and then my best friend started talking to him and they became a thing. She cut it off when he asked for head. That was in December. Now in the end of January we were hanging out and he kept telling me I looked great and lifting my skirt. We eventually got away from the group and hooked up. After we came back we decided not to tell anyone and we kept making eye contact and laughing, etc... Then as we were texting the next day we determined that Friends with Benefits was the best idea. He told me about a week later that he "just wasn't feelin it.. sorry" but then two hours later said "but i still might have to lift that skirt on saturday". Sure enough we hooked up satuday and then he came over the next day and we hung out again. He kept texting me, telling me how much he enjoyed it and that he loved my...body... aka vj... But now he's ignoring me again! It's really frustrating and I don't know if i should just wait and see what happens or just drop him? But the hard part is I hang out with him and another guy as just friends, so I can't just make him not exist. I don't know what to do. I just want him to be consistent! I hate that I'm always there for him when he's horny, but when I am he could care less.

20090223162352AAHVK6W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Did This Happen?!?!?	This guy I met about 4 months ago through a friend lives about an hour away from me. We talked on MSN every day for hours, and got to know everything about each other, and we had so much in common, down to our favourite TV show and colour. We really seemed to hit it off, and he even broke up with the girl he was casually seeing because he wanted to be with me. He would tell me things like "you always make me happy even when it seems impossible, you're literally amazing", he called me babe, told me he loved me a little while ago, and even said he could see us being together and having kids and getting married!! He was a dream come true, and I could safely say I was I love with him, and were perfect for each other. The problem is that he always seemed to have a (justified) excuse why he couldn't come visit me, like a car accident and death in the family which I confirmed through our mutual friend. Everything else seemed to be going well, until I just discovered today that he deleted me off MSN, Skype and Facebook without a single warning. I'm 20 and he's 22, and he it never seemed like he was the type of guy to shy away from commitment, through he would always say he found it hard to believe that I cared so much about him.      My question is why did this happen, did I do something wrong, did he freak out or is there a more in-depth reason to this? And what should I do now? Help me, I'm dying.

Ok, i have been dating this really sweet guy for about 4 weeks now. he took me to the movies on my b-day for our first date, and then on V-day, he took me ice skating....thats when he first kissed me. but im not counting it because is lasted for maybe 2 seconds and was kinda wet and just.....awkward and bad. but this guy sits with all my girlfriends at lunch, and walks me to my bus everyday! so I know he's into me (i hope). I asked him just now why dont we ever kiss (over I.M.) and he said " cause im bad at it." so then, we just changed the subject. Whats going on? do we just not have the chemistry or something?   p.s. im WAY too shy, so making the first move is out of the option....   and...when he walks me to my bus, to say goodbye, he hugs me and kisses the top of my head....he really is a sweetie :)   so wat do u guys think? do we just not 'have it'?    im in high school btw

20090223161409AAB6nEu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do in this situation...? I really like him!?	There is this guy...(lets call him James) and ive known him for about 5 years and i started liking him for about 3 but i never told him and he never knew. About 5 months ago he told me that he liked me and we started talking for a while. One day he just acted like he had a problem with and he left me by myself after school one day and walked away with walking me like he always does. He's goes to my church so i always see him every week. In December we had to go to a Christmas party and he was there, but as we talked with people and stuff we talked around each other never speaking a word. He even started flirting with this girl on purpose ( i think to make me jealous....) so every sunday even though we saw each other we never spoke a word. Until this sunday (yesterday) i walked out of the chapel into the lobby and i was just standing there for no reason and he came out and walked past me. He came back around and said 'hey wassup' and i said 'nothing' and then he walked away he then came back and asked me for a pen in which i told him i didnt have one and he left again. He then came back for a third time and started asking me how i was doing and stuff and asked me if i had a boyfriend (inferring that, that day in November, we actually did break up) and i told him no and he was like 'thats wassup' he then started talking to me and we made conversation and he was like 'you look good' ( i was sooo happy to hear him say that!!!!) and he asked me if i wanted to walk around and idk why but i told him no. (i think i said that bc i was hurt still from what he did in november and how he ignored me for like 3 months) he looked kinda down and then he was like he'll talk to me later. I really do want get back with him but i dont feel like i should be the one to tell him that. Should I? and also Any ideas why he was mad at me in the first place and ignored me for 3 months? and also what should i do? I just really need some advice bc i really like him and i really want to get back with him it's just i dont understand why we stopped talking in the first place.      thank you soo much!      also any advice on what i should do next time i see him??      thanks!

20090223162335AA0yw5m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Over the "gushy" phase of a rellationship normal?	Ok so my wonderful boyfriend and I have been together for 1 year.I'm not saying our relationship is boring, but it's like almost like all the "magic" and the cute little things are gone. things have been really stressful lately and since my boyfriend is pretty much my best friend in the whole world I talk to him about EVERYTHING, and he shares some of my stress  burden. We've also been arguing  more lately. He's just so blunt sometimes!, haha.      Well I think we're past the phase of falling in love and learning about eachother and all that. I think now we're feeling more steady and we're considering spending our lives together.   I think this is normal, do you agree? and has anyone else gone through this or in this?      And well let's not lie men aren't always the best romantics, haha. So what could I do to bring back those cute warm memories and feelings between eachother everynow and then?      thanks!
20090223162354AAaYRuV	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to do when you may have been a bad friend?	The other night I got into it with my friends husband.... and now she is refusing to talk to me....      Let me tell you about the situation:       Her husband is a stay at home husband (and has been for 5 years).  His mother lives with them and pays half the rent and does all of the cooking and cleaning.  My friend (the wife) goes to work full-time and overtime.  Her parents bought her a really nice truck (her "dream" car) right before she got married.  About 18months ago my friend got pregnant and her (deadbeat) husband insisted on trading in her truck for an evolution (a 4 door turbo charged car)... she was pregnant.  He ended up stressing her out so bad that she agreed to sign over her truck so that he could get a car.  After her son was born, he decided that he didnt want that car anymore and traded it in for a different one.        The other night he was saying that it was his car, and she could just take a razor scooter to work (for all he cares)   I got pissed off and pretty much told him off.....      Now both him and her have refused to have anything to do with me.... she told my husband thatI lost a friendship because I was butting in when it was none of my business....      I know she is right--the way her husband treats her is none of my business....   I just want to know.... was I really being that bad of a friend???   I truly feel like I was defending my friend as her husband was completely disrespecting her in front of our group of friends.      Should I just let this friendship go... or should I apologize??? I really dont know how to fix this problem....
20090223162917AAFAr31	Family & Relationships;Friends	What Do You Think I Should Do - I'm Really Scared?	My boyfriend told me yesterday that he was really upset and stressed out from work. He told me when he had the chance, he would call me and talk to me about it. But we got into an arguement after that, and he never called.    I kept trying to talk to him online, and when he FINALLY responded he told me he would call me tomorrow (which is today).      He's not online right now, and he's not picking up his phone.   I'm getting really nervous and worried about him...I want to go to his house tomorrow, but I'm afraid his parents will be there, and I'm scared my boyfriend will be even more angry that I visited him while his parents were home.   They do not have a house phone, what do you think I should do?      **He also used to do drugs whenever he was depressed, so I'm scared he's going to go back to them**      Should I go to his house tomorrow if he doesn't call?

When we broke up he said "school is kicking my BEEP" . So, that led me to belive that i wwasn'ta priority for him, i was just an option. So, i sstoppedtalking to him for months. He's now in a relationship and im happy for him because i have a heart and i want people to be happy. So, llatelyive been getting A LOT of text msgs from him saying: he misses me, he wants tto hangout, catch up with my life and just start talking again. He's also flirting a lot. Just today i got a text saying       him: "Your not very talkative anymore:P....."         i for one don'tknow what to say to that. I feel like its not nesccary for him to talk to me since he has a gf. Why is he flirting with me? and what should i respond to that?      BTW:   to be honest with you i miss him alot, but i want to see him happy even if that means i have to get hurt.

In my science class we have to pick a group for a lab project by Thursday.

20090223163459AAM5Xyb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just forget about all of them?	First boy: Brent. We have been talking online for a few months. We finally met and went to the movies this past weekend. We did stuff, but I'm starting to regret it, because we don't talk nearly as much, and he doesn't seem as interested in talking to me.      Second boy: Justin. We went out for a couple months and he ended up breaking up with me. He just recently said he wanted to get back together with me, but I'm not sure if I'm entirely over him or not.      Third boy: Ethan. We went out about a year ago for a couple months. We always fought and it got annoying, so we broke up, but always kept in touch, and we talked on the phone for a couple hours last night.            So my question is,   Should I put all these boys in the past?   Or should I keep going on with one, and which one?

20060718234341AA3u71f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i wait and see what happens, or do i just break up now?	I've been going out with this guy, and we've been together on and off. I broke up w/ him, then he wanted to get back with me, and i said yes. Then it happened again. And for some reason, we always seem better and im always content when we're friends. bu t i have to admit i feel kinda sorry for him. sometimes i feel i ruin his days....the first time i broke up w/ him, he cried!! i regreted it so much, but i dont want to stay w/ him for pity....yet if he turns out to be the guy im looking for, i dont want to lose him. it's too selfish to be taking him for granted. now we're together, but i dont really know how everything's going b/c we haven't seen eachother. he has summer school and i can't see him. i've sent him messages and he returns 1 out of every 3...i dont understand him.it seems kinda weird considering that he's the one always begging me, so im not sure what's going on and i need to know what to do!! i need general help.

20090223163936AAuNF0m	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Getting a divorce, who should stay in the house?	so, my friends husband hit her daughter, I mean punched her and hurt her really bad.  She didn't press charges on him, but he is out of the house.  Now, he is saying that he has every right to be there because it's both he and my friends house.  She says...no you aren't coming back here because you are a threat to us and we aren't living in fear.  So far, he hasn't come back.  But, what are his rights, if any?  I told her she can press charges at any time for the assault and she can hold that over his head.  Any advice would be appreciated.  This guy is a real a hole to her and her kids and has no perception of reality.  He lost his job for a year, got a new one to be fired in three weeks, smokes weed, doesn't do anything around the house, and is a mean son of a *****.  He says to her... I'm down, good time to bail on me!  Can you believe that, like she chose the time.  She supported him for one year while he did nothing, but collect unemployment!  LOSER!

20090223163522AADKL1R	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to deal with a loved ones death that you know is coming?	Well basically my dad is dying he could save himself but he doesnt listen to the doctors & wont take his pills or stop drinking. I dont see him much i really want to because i know this is going to happen soon but me & him never really got along.      So basically my question is if your father who put you through the worst things ever as a child was dying but you still loved him would you try to see him more? or just keep seeing him as often as you normally do which isnt very often.      And dont say im a terrible person and all that you have no idea wat the hole story behind this is

20090223163251AAZG1eK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you deal with a liar?	I should have known on our first date when he told me he was almost 28 (he wasn't even 27 1/2) that he thought nothing of lying, but I was a couple of years older than him, and thought he just wanted to appear older.       Five years later and married, his lies have continued. I don't want to divorce him..it's not that, I just don't know how to deal with this. He lies about things that are little and big. I hear people say "once a liar always a liar" and I don't want to believe this is true, but more and more I am starting to think so . I feel so pathetic becuase he sees he can do this to me and get away with it. What should I do?

20090223163625AAwuMnl	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Has anyone been married to a man with Narcisissm?	Although my spouse has not been formally diagnosed I see the traits in him after 17 years of marriage.  I studied Psychology before becoming an RN and I am working on my Masters now.  At first I thought it was the wine we were drinking at night that made him so verbally abusive towards me but now I m sure its NPD.  Now after I have threatened divorce and have the money he says he is going to change.  I have read this personality disorder is a tough one to correct.  We have had 2 counseling appointments so far and would like to be hopeful.  Has anyone out there had success with this type of mate?  Did the verbal abuse come back?  To me it feels like a constant rollar coaster ride and we are in the honey moon stage.

20090223163835AAjBomU	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I cope with a loved ones death?	Someone Very close to me died yesterday. I don't know how to deal with it. There was so much I wanted to do with him, so much I was going to ask him. He was always there and thought so highly of me. He went paraplegic 2 years ago after a 6-month coma. Just a few months ago, I started trying better myself to show some accomplishment. My grades were going up and I was just waiting to show him the 4.0 I felt so close to finally getting this quarter. I was planning on trying out for wrestling next year so I tried to get in shape. I even was thinking about applying to his old College. Now I feel its all just gone.I love him as much as my own grandparents and don't know what to do anymore. The rest of my family seems to be moving along alright though.      I've turned to God and it helps a little. I try to stay strong for my little brother and sister. What is there to do?

The whole time all my friends would tell me he was just using me and it would never progress into a real relationship. Well finally I listened to them and told him I dont want anymore contact w him. I avoid the gym now at the times I know he might be there and in general avoid the places I think he might be. When me and him were talking, he would never talk to me on his cell or text me BC he got caught by his wife and I used to drive around looking for him in places and I would never ever see him out around town. Well now that I am away from him and I dont want anymore contact w him, I see him and his wife every week it seems. Last week I saw her 2 diff days and today I was sitting at a stop light and he pulled up next to me. I just cant believe how I am seeing him everywhere and trying to avoid him so much. I was just wondering if you think there is some reason for it... as in maybe if I see him, then it will help me get over him more and more???? I really dont know but its bugging me. I get so freaked out when I see him BC I really had true feelings for him and loved him very much. I know I am stupid but its the truth and I am still getting over it. Seeing him or his wife is not helping. What should I do or act next time I see him around town?

Why do we do it? i mean u know u love someone more than life itself but yet u continue to do dumb shyt , This is my case i had the most beautifulest woman in my life each and everyday from sun up till sun down but never understood the things i was doing to hurt our relationship .I remember times when she would complain and i just took it as she was just being bitchy it always seem like it wasn't that important or it was nothing to complain about to me !.Now dont get me wrong at the time i did change the problems but it always seemed to return because i allowed the doors to stay open for bullshyt so this being said there continued to be problems that me being a man thought would just go away or be replaced with other problems ,yea at times i might have been the best boyfriend in the world but that means nothing when u continue to fuckup i know this now but it seems to fall on deaf ears so i decided hey theres nothing in this world worth losing my baby over so i changed my# that i had for bout 7 years cutting off any and everyone that might be an issue im getting rid of the porn and pictures of ex's and old memories so that we can focus on the future and not the past and also i vowed to her never to lie to her bout anything ever again because it just aint worth it because every minute ,every hour of each day i feel like dying because she isnt here it feel like i cant breath i cant think straight meaning i think about her so much theres no room or time for anything else i have started looking to god to ease the pain and it helps me sleep at night sometimes .Now dont get me wrong i know i have ****** up but god knows I WOULD NEVER FUCKUP AGAIN!!!!! Like i told u when u asked why im willing to give it all up now well imagine if u knew JESUS was coming tomorrow and u had one last chance to repint u would do any and everything to make sure u was in Gods good graces before u never had the chance again that is how i feel baby i love u and dont wanna lose my last chance to make it all right before i lose u forever .With all this being said these are the things i vow to u baby    1.

20090223163427AAplhBN	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do about my "friends" ?	I have been friends with this group of girls for about 4 years now, almost 5 (I'm 15). We always used to hang out together and go places together and if something was wrong, the other would call the other one or be a shoulder to cry on.  Recently, my friends have been leaving me out and going places without me :( they talk about all the places they have been to together especially when I am sitting right there and at lunch I sat on the far end of the table now, and talk about their boyfriends.  This hurts because they never told me they had boyfriends.. we were so close, is there anything I can do? I have some friends in my class but they are the girls that sorta just hang around with us.  I can't make new friends because I always know most of the girls in my school (it's really small) :( I haven't changed at all, why are they doing this to me?

20090223164444AAnmS8h	Family & Relationships;Friends	GUYS: My guy friend is a flirt, he almost seems gay?	Okay so i have this guy friend (we're not very close at all), he's definitely not a normal guy. At least 5 or 6 girls have asked him out this year, He's turned all of them down. Usually he's very flirty with the girl until she asks him out. Then he like starts ignoring them. He's such a flirt to girls.          The other day, he comes over to me and picks me up because I was paying attention to this other guy.He was trying to get my attention I guess, so he wraps his arms around my legs and just carries me to another room and puts me down. Then I get mad and storm back into the other room.      Today he comes over to me and puts his head on my shoulder and acts all tired. Then i was sitting on a chair and he comes over and like pushes me to the side a little so he shares half the seat with me. And then he was reading the back of my shirt and he like touches my back and it was all tingled. I don't even like him!!!      His little brother is the sweetest little thing, and i like hanging around his brother and talking to his brother (who is normal). But whenever I'm talking to his brother, he always pops up and like says or does something.      The thing is he doesn't act this way with just me. With a couple of other girls too, some a little, some a lot. And lately i've been noticing he seems to do it with everyone! At play practice today he was like fooling around with a guy, pulling the guys hoody off every 5 seconds, and like pulling this guy by his shirt and everything.(something he would do to a girl) I've never seen a guy act this way before, i am confused.      He is just a flirt and obviously a player type, its just freaky hes always doing something really really freaking touching people or like doing something or whatever. I dont really think he has any normal guy friends either.. seriously what is wrong with him? it may seem mean, but trust me if you knew this guy you would be creeped put as well.    im in 8th grade btw      So if you are a   GIRL: tell me you opinion of him   BOY: tell me why you might that he acts this way (a guys point of view)      SORRY THIS IS EXTRA LONG

I would like to share what I have learned and I would appreciate any advise on my observations and experiences I've had. I would also appreciate to hear from women and any feed back would be great.      This is what I now want to say to women I may date:      1. Because I am male and have a good job don't assume my pockets are deep and endless.      2. Please don't say on our 1st date: I can't wait for you to meet my parents...how do you know we will go out again.      3.Just because I ask you out don't assume this will lead to marriage.   4. Don't hold me responsible for YOUR expectations!   5. Don't ask me to give up a weekend with my kids because you want me to take you on a trip.   6. When you offer to go on an expensive trip, don't forget to say: I'll pay for my half!   7. When I don't call you after a first date...take the hint, don't get angry with me and trash my name because I am not interested in you.

20070115150547AADBnSS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm lonely right now, I need a woman in my life... should I do this or do that?	I've heard people say "Don't worry you'll find someone, she will come around." Meaning the right woman will come around for you eventually. I know you're lonely just be patient and you'll find someone in your life that you truly love. If you don't feel like waiting and want to just go out and look for the special someone because you've been waiting forever. Which sometimes going out looking is not such a good idea. At the same time a man needs to be outgoing and look for single females and get involved. What should I do wait for the right woman to come along, or go out to the malls, stores, and wherever and start talking to the ladies to find out what each female is about. What's the wisest way to go about this when trying to have a woman in your life? Be patient and wait or get out there and be outgoing and increase my choices?

We had wonderful communication and he treated me like I was his world although I didn’t always return the favor. There wasn’t anything that he’d allow me to want or need for. Eventually the relationship soured and he either cheated or found someone really quickly because two days after the break up there was someone new. I just recently found out that he went to the army and he’s still w/her-but for some reason I would just like closure. It’s been almost a year. What should I do?

20070315221414AAMYfmO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I say this to the girl I miss? (I turned 17 a month ago) What do I get for her 17th b-day in two weeks?	The reason I liked her in the first place is because she said she liked me online after two weeks of us talking, then I was excited because I felt good that someone finally liked me. I asked her how she felt about me the next day, then she said she didn't really know, she had too many boys in her life and didn't know how to handle it. After a month she told me she didn't liked me but I still liked her. So I kept talking to her hoping she would eventually change her mind and give me a chance. After a while I noticed she was everything I've looked for in a girl and I fell in love with her. After 4 months of us talking she told me she was falling in love with someone else, whom she gave a chance and not me, and that a couple of her friends were falling in love too. I implied to her that I was falling in love with her and she kept asking me who. Then she asked if it was with her, but I felt I shouldn't say so online so I changed the subject and found out we were unknowingly both watching
20070327124919AAlB2pZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	An old friend wants me to come visit not sure if I should go or not?	I dated this guy on an off all through high school.  In my jr year I had to move.  We kept in touch on and off ever since.  Now ten years later we are both devorced and currently single.  We recently started talking again every day and I still enjoy talking to him just as much now as I did then.    He says he really wants to see me and be apart of my life.  He keeps telling me how much I have always meant to him.  Part of me would like to see him, then again part of me wants to play it safe.  He says that he has had me in his mind every day for the past ten years and thinks if I could just find it to give him a chacne then it would be good.  I find it hard to trust anyone.  And as he said I know him better than anyone, besides his mom, which makes me want to be even more careful.  Part of me have always wonder what would have happened if I had not moved or if I could see him again.  We are both 27 and sigle so what would it hurt?

Voilà j'ai 21 ans je regarde ma vie affective et je me pose cette question : est-il possible de ne pas pouvoir être aimée?  Je veux dire, est-il possible que je n'attire que des personnes intéressées par le sexe alors que je recherche sincèrement une relation longue durée?      Mon attitude n'est pas séductrice ni vulgaire, chais pas ?a doit être mes phéromones qui sont ultra puissantes...  Les hommes que je rencontre c'est une chose, encore ?a peut être flatteur.  Mais depuis que j'ai rompu mes fiancailles avec mon ex les gar?ons que je pensais être mes amis me sollicitent sans aucun tact et puis me nient parce que je refuse leur invitation.      Dois-je me résoudre à être la ma?tresse, le plan pur plaisir, la fille avec qui on s'affiche pour se faire de la publicité?

20070110112626AAesaB2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this love impossible?	I'm in love with a 24 years old woman, I am 25. Maybe I am wrong, but I think there is a good possibility she likes me too. Yesterday, while chatting with her, I expressed myself telling her that I like the way she is. She told me that the feeling was mutual. Normally, it would express my feelings, but the case is that she currently has a relationship already for 8 years now. So, I doubt if it is ok to express my feeling for her. Would you?       Secondly, I heard she has some kind of decease that will eventually affect her. She would be in a wheel chair by then. I am not sure I would like that. But I do not dare to ask her all the details about it.      Please tell me what to do!

20070204082427AADo7Fm	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I say to my friend?	I used to be very close to my friend, Erin.  We have known each other for sixteen years and she was a bridesmaid in my wedding. Anyway, about 5 years ago she started getting really self-centered and would dominate all conversation talking about her life.  I still talked to her and hung out with her b/c I thought it might be a passing phase.  She started getting pretty bad about calling back or answering emails.  One day, I got a vmail message in which she said, "Please call me right away.  It is an emergency."  So I called her right back and got her vmail.  I called all week and emailed and was getting worried.  Basically, I tried to reach her on a weekly basis for almost a year and she never responded.  I know her phone was in service and her email is correct.  After a year I gave up and decided to write her off.  So THREE YEARS later, she is sending me email messages saying, "What's up?" like nothing ever happened.  What should I do?  Also, I know I did nothing to hurt her.

I know a guy in my school who seems not to be very interested in girls no matter how sexy or beautiful they are. He sometimes even looks down on those guys who are always hanging out with girls and looking for more girlfriends.... Is he too shy to look at them?or is he too arrogant?       He is pretty quiet, serious and cool all the time. but he doesn't seem to act like a cool guy like most guys nowadays who sometimes flirt with others and put gel on their hair(to look cool n handsome)   He is a smart and intelligent guy. i think he does not have a girlfriend at all.       What do you think of this weird guy? Do you think girls like him?

20060923222100AARbAe2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Inexperienced?	ok, so I'm 18 and I've had a few boyfriends, but all of my relationships have been really short lived and really casual. I've never had a REAL kiss, just little pecks, and I'm a virgin (obviously). I get hit on a lot by guys but I'm usually too shy/nervous to have it go anywhere.   so my problem is that theres this guy who I've been kind of seeing, like we've gone out a few times but technically we're just friends. the thing is that he's had a number of very serious girl friends, and he's a lot more experienced then me with relationships in general. I think he's still a virgin, but I wouldn't be terribly surprised if he wasn't.   I'm worried that my inexperience will ruin the whole thing. does it work if one person is experienced and the other isn't? what if I'm a terrible kisser? i don't know how to be a good girlfriend.   sorry, this question is so long, I just really don't want to mess this up because I really like this guy.   Any advice/thoughts?

20061128064904AAYxugx	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need some advice.?	There's a girl I used to know named Lisa Popielaski. I met her through my friend Donald. I used to go over her house all the time, hanging out with her and her boyfriend Jay, smoking weed, listening to music... just hanging out. Eventually I started falling for her. Everytime I found out Donald was going over her house, I would try my best to go just to see her. The one moment I remember the most is when Jay's sister came over. They were in the kitchen and Lisa and I were in the living room. I told her how I felt and we shared our first kiss. I still remember how she tastes. For the next few weeks after that, we would sneak kisses whenever we could. I was the happiest when I was with her. Then one day, Jay went to BK to get some food and he came back and my arm was around Lisa. He told me to stay away, and I did, and I regretted it ever since. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about her. What I need advice on is how to get over her. Any advice I'll happily take.

My Sikh friend had a girlfriend who is a Muslim, they are both age 17 from the UK. They were keeping their relationship quiet from their parents but then the muslim girls brothers found out and were threatening my friend, he wanted me to sort them out which i had no intention of doing. i tried telling my friend to end the relationship but he wouldnt, i also told him there is many other girls out there better than her. The girl has a terrible attitude problem for example- forcing him to stop smoking, threatening to kill herself if he dont do certian things, looking at other men in front of him and commenting on them...etc. She was cheating on him at the time with someone he knew and he didn't care.   After this the girl stopped speaking to him and he has changed  alot and is going mad over her. He wont stop trying to ger her back and i think he is going mental now. I have tried my best persuading him but i havent had any luck.

20070106025031AA9C4ir	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need advice about the girl i'm crazy about?	I can't seem to figure out what to do about a girl. She drives me absolutely insane, she embodies exactly what I want in a girl, she's smart, shares my sense of humor, and on top of that she has the most amazing smile. I hate to sound like a 8th grade  girl here, but I just cant get her out of my head. Anyway, as I've gotten to know her, she's always given me little hints: putting her head on my shoulder, sitting in my lap, etc... but she'll never lean in her 10% for a kiss (and i cant bring myself to force anything on her, that's just wrong)...      Anyway, I'm not even sure if I should continue with this all, as I've been acquainted with her past boyfriends, i know she has a tendency to use people, so i try not to overextend myself as i will subsequently lose the power in the relationship, and i don't want to be used.
20070110124325AAUnZOD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are divorced women so interested in me?	For some reason, I seem to keep attracting divorced, recently divorced and soon-to-be divorced women in their 30's (some with kids, others, not)...and I can't figure out why, although I have an idea. I am a 34 year-old man who is by, all accounts, average. I am of average height, weight, build and appearance.  I do exercise moderately, but am by no means athletic. I consider my looks "average"...but such things are quite subjective, I know. I am widely regarded by friends, family & co-workers as being a "nice guy."  I am a practicing Catholic, but am by no means a saint.  I am college-educated, and am employed in the technical field. My income range is between $30-$40K...so I am by no means rich or even "well-off."  I have never been married, have no kids and am actively dating and looking forward to marriage someday.  Are these women attracted to me because I offer a "fresh start": with no ex or kids to deal with other than theirs?

20070115161057AAVPOun	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Low Sex Drive...only 21 years old!?	Now am in a relationship that may last a very long time. My boyfriend is not pressuring me for sex, he says we will do it when am ready. On friday, we had sex for the first time, he disvirgined me, but there was no pleasure in it, it was only pain! I hated it really, it hurt like hell! The thing is he always like to cuddle and make out but I never feel like it. Also, I dont feel anything when he touches or carresses my boobs. Its like he is touching my head! When he fingers me I get aroused a bit but it quickly fades away. When he like eats me (u know down there...) I like it but that quickly fades away. Its like I get bored too quickly and turned off. Last night he tried to cuddle, which we did for a minute, then I got turned of and wanted to sleep cos I had work the next day, then he said "your too stiff!" and was kinda upset. What do I do? I am too young to be having a low sexual drive, right? I have experimented with a girl before I liked it, but not enough to do it again though!

My friend wanted to go out with this guy but his friend was visiting from out of town and he had to bring him. So I went as his date and we double-dated.      So before we went out, when they met us at my friend's house, my friend and I went to the other room right after we greeted them just to get something. And so as we were walking to the other room from them I heard my date say to the other guy    "h o l y s h i t, man"    so does that mean that he liked how i looked or he didn't?? he said it in a surprised way so it could go either way, but we did have a good time on the date.

20070117211633AACN51v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	First dating at 24?	To make a long story short, I'm 24 and I've never dated before. Basically, girls were interested, but I never pursued anything(mostly because I wanted to find a career and go after my interests.)       Now I'm kind of feeling out of place and also I really want to date. I guess my question is, how should a 24 year old guy with absolutely no experience go about this? Walking into a bar and hitting on a random girl seems a bit extreme, but it's probably either that or online dating.      And no, I don't really have any women friends right now that I could ask(to set me up on a date.) There's my friend Kelly who I've known for years, but she doesn't have many female friends(other than one girl that I really wasn't interested in.)

20070124065324AAkvCHI	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I deal with an arrogant college roommate?	Before i first moved in, he said he was a neat freak and likes working. After a few months, he was doing what he said. He had food stamps and he kept the room cleaned. We both did our part in keeping food in the dorm and kept the room cleaned. He was like the coolest roommate around.       Then a few months later after that, hell broke loose, but quietly. The food stamps stopped and he had to get new jobs. He started to put his whole checks into his car note, and none on food. He got into it with this girl sexual and now thats all he talks about. He starts to defend for himself and care more about himself. When I ask him for a ride to work because I'm a little late, or go somewhere important to me and not to him, ill even offer gas, and he would take his good o time and sit on the computer.

My manager locked the doors and told them they can talk to my co-worker later. They got pissed walked and made a sharp right not going towards their car but the office parking lot. About two minutes later I see them go back to their car. I was curious so when I walked out they bolted. Walked by my car and my whole driver side and the top of my trunk was keyed down to the metal, another employee's car next to mine was keyed on the trunk. We know who did this and my co-worker whose drama this is acts like it is not her problem. I am very upset and I do not know what to do. Should I ask her for the deductible amount needed to get it fixed before it starts to rust or should I wait for the cops to try and get them which could take months who knows. I feel in a way this is ALL her fault and she should offer this and she should wait on the cops! HELP!!!

I cried all the time so I changed the password for his voicemail so that i could check it.  he got pissed, changed his number and didn't contact me during christmas or new years.  We went a month without contacting each other.  During this time I would cry constantly.  I got his new number and everything was eating me up so i called.  then we started being in contact again. He has a girlfriend of about 3 months now. And i have a boyfriend. He called me randomly on valentines day to say happy v-day. we talk frequently on the phone for long periods of time now,We read sappy poems about each other to each other, But he constantly brings up how much he's starting to love his girlfriend. i feel that it's kinda fake...a part of me thinks that he just wants to be friends but the way our conversations go and the things we say to each other it's like something is still there...what do you think?

20070316142313AAdOzzw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm confused about this guy?	so I thought this guy had been looking at me for a while at school, so I added him to facebook and sent him a msg just saying who I was.  He never msged me, although I didn't ask any questions. so I assumed he wasnt interested.  Like 2 days later I see him on the bus and he sits like 2 seats away from and it seemed as if he was staring at me the whole time. I was too embarrassed to look at him because he never replied to my msg and I felt like a moron. He never moved after more seats were available so I dont get it. if I wasnt interested in someone who sent me a msg I would sit away from them not stare at them. I would try to get as far away from them as possible.

20070325090440AArEXqe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have decided to move on. But, If my ex calls me, what should I do?	My ex wrote me this letter, recently. I still love him, but I don't like his attitude. What should I do if/when he does call?   I don't want to have to feel like I have to call you because I feel forced. Our conversations don't feel the same way to me as before. I feel strained. This is partly because it is not important to me, I find myself running out of minutes. Maybe I am being heavy handed, but I cannot give you the time you want and the ability to say I can call you at this time. I would rather say, let me get back to you when I feel comfortable, rather than, tomorrow, because I know tomorrow I am going to be busy. There is no rush, either, to do anything, and if there was a rush, I would really need a good explanation...   I do not want the responsibility of being the reason you are visiting NYC. What do you want now, out of our conversations? Be clear. Right now I feel there is nothing to be had except our history. I know what I want. I want to feel good when I talk to you.

20070624231503AA4eKQi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend's old highschool crush is calling/PMing him a lot suddenly... how do I deal?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half, and we have not had any problems, unless you count to small squabbles about a TV show or something. Nothing major. I'm twenty, he is twenty-four.      I guess you can say gradually a girl that he used to be friends with, and used to have a major crush on in his high school has been calling him lately and maybe even hinting that she wants him with things like "Don't you ever wish you could go back in time and change things in high school? I wish I had not dated people I did, and one I should have" or something to that degree. She also brought up a kiss they shared. It's freaking him out and he's worried that she's trying to "find someone to take care of her child" as his mother puts it (She's divorced with a child) and that it's going to tear us apart. I trust him and I don't think he'll make any moves, as he tells me he's "invested too much into this relationship to ruin what I have with you" But I've never been in this situation.

I am determined to quit smoking because i can feel it taking its toll on me. I hate the fact that my boyfriend smokes and we are moving in together soon.

I thought it was bad enough ignoring the complaining, whining, simmpering, feable bodied , idiodic, dramatic, stupid (did I say whining or complaining) women that I work with that have a problem with their Menstrual Cycle.

20070810121534AAgTXSX	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do you think he will miss me?	My ex was the biggest geek, I've ever known. He is about as big around as he is tall, horrible and inexperienced in bed, he walks like a penguin, most of the time his butt crack showing over the top of his pants. He is rather unattractive, during sex he would squash me with his weight, he had a 2" penis, and I think that was due to size. I felt so sorry for him at first when I befriended him. We were suppose to get married, until I found out he was into the devil worshipping crowd and was trying to cheat on me (the girls rejected him over and over, quite rudely), but he spent all kinds of money on them. I broke up with him when I discovered this secret life and he agreed to go to Church. I caught him in several more lies and have no trust. I ended the engagement and his only reply was a satanic text message. I am an attractive, ambitious, loving and caring person. At work they begged me to dump him. I bothers me, but do you think he at least misses me?

Es un poco  timida pero linda.Se lleva bien con todos y inspira confianza.      b)mujer facil que no piensas en tener una relacion seria sino nada mas besarse etc... Es linda te puedes reir con ella y puedes tener tambien una conversacion seria.      Las dos opciones son casi iguales. Pregunto esto porque me he dado cuenta que las personas como la opcion b son las preferidas pero nada mas las usan mientras que la opcion a casi nunca las buscan. Quisiera saber que es lo que prefieren de la opcion b y que cambiarian de la opcion a. Y si podrian sentirse atraidos hacia la opcion a.

20070730163016AABWj55	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Communicating issues!?	I suck at answering questions.  I always use 1 of 2 responses: I don't know  or  I don't care.  It is starting to bother my boyfriend.  He wants to do what I want to do but I never give him a direct answer and I let him do all of the deciding in our relationship.  I never make the first move...mostly because I am scared that if I tell him what I really think, he won't like my answer and get mad at me.  (fyi: I feel this way because I grew up in a home where if you said the wrong answer, you would get "punished")  How do I change into someone who has an opinion instead of always going with whatever answer i get? How do I become less afraid of the reaction I get from my boyfriend?

20070710162320AAbcvGA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get over someone who you had the best chemistry with in the world.. but has a girlfriend?	The attraction was immediate. I found out he had a girlfriend so I figured nothing would ever happen between us . I am not the kind of girl who goes after men who are taken because I've been cheated on and I know how it feels. I still had a crush on him.  He was like my fantasy guy.  Soon we became great friends . We greatly enjoyed each others company.   Then one day we kissed and things started happening between us.  I knew this was wrong but being with him was the best feeling I have ever had with a guy in my life.  We had perfect chemistry it was extrodinary.  Later he moved away but we still kept in touch and saw each other whenever we could.  He even bought the girl a ring but this still didnt stop us.  We discussed maybe one day just being friends but we weren't ready for that yet because we agreed that being together is amazing. Now I havent seen him for a year so you would think I would be able to get over him but no man since compares to him

Then he said he could never have a girlfriend ever and i would have to grow up and accept him as he was. we talked a bit over the next couple months, now he asked me to a movie this week, we went and it was amazing, then my feelings came back. he mentioned other guys i hd been with since him descreetly but as if it bothered him. We went to another movie on friday, i can feel we both are in love but we are both afraid. should i take what he said before seriosuly and just forget about it or give him the benefit of the doubt that he is afraid? We are both so afriad to make a move on each other, but i kno we want to. what should i do next..

20070415000949AAsAJHB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need advice from someone who has walked a mile in my shoes.?	As of this coming Monday, my husband of 12 years in filing divorce papers. We have been seperated now going on three years. (I know, "Why did you wait so long!") the thing is, that I still have alot of feelings left for him, and I am finding myself thinking of him more often thn usual. We didnt split on bad term. We had gotten married at a young age, and I think as we grew up, we grew apart. We had three children together. About a year ago, we happened to be in a room, just the two of us, and he kissed me, and told me if I didnt feel the same way, to not kiss him back. Well, I didnt pull away. We sat and talked for a while and concidered maybe trying it again. A year has went by, and we have moved on with our lives. My question is, will these feeling ever go away, and if so, when will I feel some relief.

20070428053801AAuL9mV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys--- would you cuddle/ kiss a girl after having sex if you didn't have feelings for her?	My guy friend and I had a tryst last night which ended up 3 hours of great sex, lots of naked cuddling during, between, and after sex, and a nice kiss on the lips before he left for the night. He spent a lot of time telling me my hair and skin were "so soft " and looking into my eyes while we were being intimate. We cuddled on the sofa watching a movie afterwards and he put his arm around me and played with my hair.  Could this mean he's got feelings for me ( which I wouldn't mind at al), or is this just part of the way guys are after/ during sex that is supposedly emotion-free? Can you guys give me your honest opinions?

20070509084218AATcGbC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i let this go....its been almost a year?	Ok so heres what happened….Yes, it has been almost a year but trust was broken so much that it is just hard to forget. Last year when the fair was on in town I asked my boyfriend to go with me for just one of the events. He said he didn’t like fairs and that they were stupid. Non the less it was in the town he grew up in and he said he would probably just end up seeing someone he didn’t want to see and get in a fight or something. So I left it at that. Then come to find out on the last day before the weekend he tells me while I am at work that he has to help his dad with livestock and he would be leaving soon and not sure when he would get back. That’s not uncommon. BUT there was just something about this story I didn’t quite believe. Well at that point I couldn’t say he was lying. So later in the night I called him and he answered I could hear tons of talking in the background and knew exactly what he did. Instead of telling me he wanted to do something with his friends he lied and went to the fair and kept lying about it throughout the night. It would have been ok but I knew he was drinking. He finally got home and knew I was mad so he threw a fit. The next day we talked about it and he supposedly wont do it again. But its fair season here almost and its just hard to trust that he wont. Any suggestions?
20070731080214AAocmV4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship Advise Please?	Things have been a mess lately. I am unhappy with my current job and I know I have been driving my bf nuts over it. We have talked about it, but its never a serious conversation so I just get more irritated. He knows right now what I want to do but yet invites over a friend and they end up doing the things I want to do with him. I usually don’t mind but with all this stress its really getting to me. He gets mad at me for talking about my job and for a while I just dropped it and didn’t talk to anyone about it. I get mad at him for having this friend over 2 or three days and nights a week right now with the way I feel. Then hes mad at me for being mad at him about his friend. He just doesn’t understand anything and doesn’t listen. So we were both mad last night and he actually took my phone and hung up on a gf that I was talking to. Me I don’t just sit and be quiet. I was mad and we ended up fighting for real on the floor. I ended up with a nice bruise on my arm. This morning I am so embarrassed about it since his friend was there, im sure hes not but after the way he acted he really should be. Wouldn’t you know that he had had about a 6 pack before it all. We have got to talk. Any advise?
20070723094309AAPCqy4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this could work? Advise please!?	I have been working my job for 4 years now and you know how it goes you get kinda tired of it. Well last week it was depressing me even to come in. I talked to my boyfriend, his mom and my mom about it. They just changed a lot of things and i am unhappy about them. First longer hours when i want a part time job, my lunch was an hour and they want to shorten it to half an hour and on some days they even want me to stay later. I know for some that would be perfect but not for me. I enjoyed my own schedule. I have gotten a bit of advice from everyone i have talked to but yesterday i was upset again about my job. And my boy asked what was wrong so i told him and he suggested that i work this week and if im still unhappy then i can work with him. He cares for and deals livestock. I have been around them my whole life and love the freedom of that job i do it when ever i can. I am also planning to do a side part time job for some extra money. Anyone ever worked with their gf or bf? Didit work

I've been kinda flirting with this girl recently, nothing serious, no "snogging" as some might say but I think she likes me, she always wants to hang around with me e.g. hugs, arms around shoulders and stuff like that, we mess about togther, i've been reading some "how to tell if they like you" tutorials and stuff on the internet and some of the facts and information on there was the same as this relationship e.g. she calls me a name(not a curse), she makes eye contact, she hugs me and stuff, my mates say she trys to kiss me or she likes me, on instant messaging she always talks to me, she almost instantly talks to me when she/i sign in.      I'm 16.   She's 16.   Oh she also likes this other guy which i'm sure of, she doesn't really hug him and stuff when i'm around though, and if I ask her about her about hearts and stuff in her personal message she just says it isn't for him.      Thanks

Since we're poor my aunt and uncle supported my studies and I've lived with them for more than 10 years and fortunately I finished my studies had a college degree and eventually landed my first job away from our hometown, I wanted the job because I wanted to be independent. Anyway, my stepfather is the  laziest person I've ever met in my entire life. I was only 9 then but I didn't want my mother to marry the guy, two weeks after they were married they started fighting until the fightings were physical already, my stepfather didn't have a regular job and he's a drunkard and everytime he came home drunk he starts a fight with my mom, my brother and I witnessed how he hit our mother and we just cried and felt hopeless because we were kids.

20070607175700AAUQ5Mk	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I get over this?	Hi people. Got a problem. I need advice please as I am going nuts over this.      I am very deeply in love with someone, but we can never be together. The reason being that he is married - to his childhood sweetheart, just to make it worse. They've been together since they started high school 16 years ago. They have 2 young kids and I'm certain that they have a happy home.      He and I are close friends, and we spend a lot of time together as we work together. Emotionally we have a very strong bond, to the point where each of us usually knows exactly what the other is thinking. If we're apart and something bad happens to one of us, the other knows. We both understand one another in a way that nobody else ever has. We both feel like we are soulmates in some weird way.      I know he feels the same way as I do, we have both made it obvious, although it is unspoken. It is getting more difficult to hide, and people have started to notice how close we've become.

However, he just got out of a long term relationship, and keeps saying he's not ready, which i told him i was cool with. But then he tells me how he's going out with her and how he has had a crush on her for a while, but then we'll go out, and it seems like he likes me, i know he's not after a booty call, cause he doesnt want sex till he's in a relationship, but he keeps breaking my heart one day and making me feel loved the next..   His frends told me he's socialy unsure with women, but this seems alittle weird.   I dont know if he's messing with me or if he's just stupid when it comes to my feelings...

Looks arent a problem for me, i keep my self looking as best as possible, so i would repel girls.      Now any tips on flirtaciously hooking up with some ladies would be greatly appreciated.    I can say Hi without a problem even to the hottest of girls, but continuing to talk is a problem.      I also know when the time is right to approach as i get sexy glances from them, with a smile following that.   Tips on what TO SAY after the initial approach would be Awsome.    I am willing to spend time at local places and practise on whatever u provide (By local i mean the mall, movies etc.)      Hopefully i dont sound arrogant to u, as i am not. Any INTELIGENT tips/answers  would help.

20070728151502AAiZz2Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy like me?	I have just finished my first week at my new job as a security officer. One of the warehouse staff trainer's from day one, has always said hello to me in a sort of flirty way and asking if I was ok. Then there was an occasion where I had to do a search and he was the person I had to search. Anyway almost all the guys I searched during the week, stood at least two feet away, yet this guy decides to stand about half a foot away, and decides to make a flirty comment regarding the wand, used for searches. Everytime I sit in the reception, I obviously have people go back and forth and everytime he does he say hi and smiles at me, and once during those points he gave me this hand gesture(maybe someone can tell me what it means), he extended his thumb, index finger, and little finger while the middle and ring finger touch the palm.   Another situation was where it was breakfast time at the canteen and I decided to get something, he was in front of me and he winked at me. What do you guys think

20070828232246AApRbkK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think I need a new best friend?	My BF (best friend) and I occasionally have fun talking. Other times, it's boring b/c we're really different with no similarities. I don't feel comfortable asking her for advice because she's never sympathetic, sweet, or anything like that (I've never seen her cry & she never asks me for advice). But we've been best friends w/o fighting since kindergarten, & I'm in 8th grade next week. So I can go beyond my usual shyness around her & not care. With other friends, it's somehow never the same. We share many memories together. But I feel like I need someone a more similar. The problem is, I feel like we're joined @ the hip since we always walk around school together. & even if I tried, I'm afraid I will never find anyone I can get as close to my BF. Did I mention she can be a bad influence (nothing TOO bad)? I have other friends I can talk to, but they will never be the same. I tried to make friends in 7th grade, but I wasn't close enough to them. :(   Thanks for helping me. =]

He doesn't seem like the type of guy that would like me, lol. He's like..pretty popular, and has a lot of friends, and a lot of girls like him. And me? Well, i just hang out with a small group of people, i don't wear makeup, and I'm really really shy/reserved with people I don't know well, or feel uncomfortable around. I've never had a boyfriend, either. It's not that I don't get asked out or anything, though. Today at that fair thingy some random guy asked for my # 0__o lol, totally a WTF moment. hahahaha      There was also a slide thingy and he was going up the stairs as i was sliding down, and he held his hand out, which i later realized was that he wanted me to slap it or something? IDK. hahaha. I can't flirt for my life. 0__o seriously. xDD      Mind you, he does things like this all the time...one time, he brought over a CUP back to my house. 0__o hahaha.

20080505103535AAPh2rC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship question?	soo..I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years.   and sometimes..it seems like we just arent excited to see or talk to eachother anymore.   when i call him after a long day at work we may be like "oh, hi". some part of me feels like we are so much different than we were over 2 years ago. we are juniors in high school and i have always believed i am going to spend my life with him. thru the thick and thin we always got thru everything. i just want some advice from people who are in a long term relationship (preferrably either in high school or telling about one from high school). i am a negative person a lot of the time (my boyfriend tells me this is why we dont always get along) , but I just wish we had more excitement in our relationship and were more excited to talk to eachother. We arent falling apart right?

So I met this guy online, we had hours of great phone conversation, then we met in person, totally clicked and wound up (despite my best intentions) in bed together. The sex was great, don't get me wrong, but there is something awkward about the whole thing because he's really really skinny, wheras I am average size but very curvaceous. I'm just wondering if this is anything anyone else has gone through, and whether I should keep going with it, hoping at some point it doesn't feel so weird, or if I'm always going to be kind of freaked out by his skinniness. He spoke of gaining weight, but I certainly don't expect anyone to change for me. Even if I lost weight I think my bones weigh more than he does. He has a cute face, he's very strong, what weight he does have is all pure muscle, he seems very smitten with me, he has a decent job and a good family, all the things I normally look for, its just that I feel a little weird being so much bigger than him, like those weird couples on Maury!
20081107095733AAOp2jv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Long distance issues?	If I am an a long distance thing that maybe might be a relationship or may not, and I feel like he's pulling back, any suggestions to maybe let him know I'm still interested. Or if he's stopped contacting me, is it time to just accept he's not all that interested? We used to email every day, now its been a few days with no response. Also, I asked him a few messages back about when he might like to come down (we live 2.5 hours apart) and got no response? Do I just drop it, or should I make it clear to him that I am interested in this developing in to something? Ideas, suggestions, etc...

One of my best friends got his gf pregnant.   Do you rely on your lover for bc? Girls will   say they are "alergic" to latex or lamb skin.   What a bunch of bs! They will say they also   are on the pill. Keep your johnson bagged!   NOT just for bc but for std's!    And don't permit your lover to control your condoms.   Keep them in a safe place yourself!
20080430185400AA0ATjS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Solution to a teenage crisis?	My friend is currently freaking out over a note she found in her locker. She doesn't know what to do about it and won't take any advice I give her. She dispises secrets and is afriad it's just her friends playing a trick on her. It was a short poem obviously adressed to her without a signature. It was handwritten.  I told her to let it blow over because I don't think her friends would do it again and maybe she'll get another note, but she really can't stand waiting.

20070921041909AAwGhCu	Family & Relationships;Friends	Cual es para ti el sentido de la vida ??	Quizás tú sientes que el dinero, el poder, o encontrar a tu pareja puede ser el sentido de tu vida.      O quizás buscas el sentido de tu vida en las opiniones y en la búsqueda de aprobación de tus amigos, tus padres, etc., pero siempre acabas sintiéndote igual: con una sensación interior de desesperanza y vacío.      Pero lo más interesante, es que el sentido de tu vida lo sientes, por primera vez, cuando sufres un gran estremecimiento emocional o está en peligro tu vida.      Es, en esos momentos, cuando todo aparece tan claro como si, después de una tarde con neblina, esta se disipara y apareciera el sol, reluciente, ante tus sorprendidos ojos.      ?Haz hecho alguna vez el experimento de visualizarte en tu propio funeral? ?De imaginarte el recuerdo que deseas dejar en tus amigos y tu familia?      Si no lo has hecho… imagínate por un instante, que hay una tumba, que estás asistiendo a un funeral… y que abres la tapa, para ver a la persona que está dentro… ?y para tu sorpresa… ?eres tú mismo!      Es tu propio funeral.      ?Por qué deseas que te recuerden las personas que están asistiendo a tu funeral?... piensa por un instante…      Ahora, ?Qué te hubiera gustado haber logrado? ?Haber experimentado?... piensa por unos instantes…

20070907131614AAPn2sb	Family & Relationships;Friends	Qué es para ti enamorarse ?	Enamorarse es un estado emocional de alegría y felicidad que sentimos cuando nos encontramos fuertemente atraídos por otra persona, a la que idealizamos y le atribuimos toda una serie de cualidades que en la mayoría de los casos magnificamos.      En cada persona el enamoramiento surge por causas diferentes y específicas. Vemos en esa persona a un ser encantador que nos cautiva por una serie de cualidades que nos gustan y nos atraen, su manera de ser, comportarse, moverse, belleza, inteligencia, etc. Incluso a veces no encontramos una causa objetiva y concreta que justifique los sentimientos que experimentamos.      Cuando la persona enamorada es correspondida, siente un deseo irresistible de estar con la otra persona, de conocerla y de ahondar en su vida. Pero cuando esto no es así y el enamorado no es correspondido, experimenta un sentimiento de tristeza y frustración que tendrá que ir superando para salir de este estado.       http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=lmziuy9syY... 
20081021124255AAEOrZ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do people in boarding schools tend to get into relationships with eachother or hookup or do things outside?	Like this boarding school has only 500 people (half of them don't speak English) and everyone lives there 24-7.

Rarley talk.  But I've always been so interested in him because he's so mysterious and hardly ever talks to girls... at all.  He's a basketball player, and very smart.  Totally does not fit into your sterotype about blacks.      And well a couple days I talked to him online.. about homework.  And it was weird because usually i would ask him for homework and hed answer and we would be done.  However this time he persues a conversation.  And the next day I promised him to let him see my notes, which when I went to find him he asks if i needed them and I did.  So we parted.. only to find each other right outside school.. and I shyed away...      after that not much has happened.  though he sitts behind me in class.. and i feel him listening to my conversations...      what should I do?  Sometimes I dont think hes interested in me thats why he doenst talk. I'm asian, hardworking, and lacking a bit of confidence  boys just dont come to me
20080429164508AAsfM55	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have a right to be concerned about this or am I being irrational?	I'm a 23 year old woman.  I'm dating a 25 year old man.  He was in a relationship with this other girl during highschool, college for a year and they broke up about 3 years ago because she cheated on him.  What gets me is that after what she did to him and after all this time he still kept in touch with her.  Like calling every day almost.  For a few months straight before we started dating.  The first time I went to his place there was a picture of this girl up on his mirror.  I didn't know who it was, but the next time I went it was taken down.  Then we went out to supper this one day.  She called and was complaining about her knee and he said "aww baby" I got really mad and he said it was an accident because he was used to talking to me and saying that.  I tried to just blow it off.  Then I noticed that he used to visit her two hours away.  She is engaged.  Her fiance allowed that?!  I also found a couple of text messages from her, he had bought hair products from where she worked

20081006015055AAkwfFk	Family & Relationships;Family	Has my mum ruined her life?	My mum got married last year really quickly, after only knowing the guy for a few months. I didn't want her to go through with it but she did. The thing is before when she was single she had friends, hobbies and a life i love to have if i was forty. Now all she does is sit at home ordering her new husband around, and he loves to do it, and she has o life anymore, and has absolutely no confidence and eats so much more and she has depression anyway and wont work, and neither will her new husband. personally he gives me the creeps and i tried giving him a chance but he just wont try to talk to me. Its like he is trying to get me away from mum by telling her what an awful daughter i am, which i am not, i love My mum to bits but its like he is trying to take her away from me, so he can have her all to himself. He has schizophrenia . Earlier this year i had serious depression and was considering suicide and my mum wasn't there for me at all, she was too busy with her new husband, buying him gifts all the time, expensive things even though she cannot afford it, she isn't working. What should i do? I love mum so much but i am so angry that she wasn't there for me, she didn't ring me for months and i was so sad back then, though i am much happier now, and her new husband seems to be trying to separate us, she hasn't got a life any more. what should i do?

20080116152442AAB2RhH	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm stressed, and need help!?	I used to be the kind of girl who never gets stressed, doesn't cry, etc.  But lately, i fell like i'm always stressed, and I cry myself to sleep alot and people always are asking if i'm okay because they say I look stressed and tired.      I'm a senior and I graudate in 5 months, and i'm stressed about college applications and everything.      I'm stressed about getting them in on time, and for getting enough service hours to graduate with honors.        My biggest problem is that my parents, mostly my mom, doesn't trust me staying after school.  And I have no idea why.      I've never gotten in trouble, have been getting A's and B's (in AP classes), never done drugs, smoked, drinked, and I dont even date.  My younger sister who's in 10th grade however, has been caught doing some of those things, and so they don't trust her and automatically assume i'm going to end up like her if I stay after school.      What should I do?  I've tried telling my parents but they keep saying "it's for the best."

20081103164502AAQN6Gi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help dealing with my ex's behavior?	know this is a long read, so I'll give lots of points for the best answer!      I am a 17 year old girl, my ex and I broke up 6 months ago.Although I've been in a lot of relationships for my age, ours was the deepest and most romantic relationship I've been in so far. We were totally devoted to each other but there was lots of jealousy because LOTS of girls wanted him and LOTS of guys wanted me.(not to sound conceited) After we broke up he continued to try and make me jealous. One thing lead to another and we ended up in a physical fight between me, him, his friend, and 2 of my guy friends. My friends were about to fight him but I jumped in and slammed him against the locker until the cops came.Thus, it ended very dramatically and everyone knew about it, so we stopped talking for 5 months. During that time, he got people to try and get information from me on myspace, and he started telling mutual friends that I was having sex with one of my guy friends.(Not true) He got a new girlfriend, who he makes call him by his last name?? and he uses the same nicknames that WE made up for each other on her.& I got a new boyfriend but I broke up with him after a few weeks. He still is dating his girlfriend, but he's playing her, he kisses and touches other girls in public and talks about it to all his friends, which he DIDN'T do with me. He might have cheated when he went out of town, but I honestly don't think he did. He was smitten with me. So 3 weeks ago, we finally talked again, and we both apologized for everything that happened between us. But I figured he still wanted to pretend like we weren't talking in public to keep up his "image"(He doesn't want people to think that he still has feelings for the girl who whopped him). Nevertheless I would notice him getting closer to me when we sat near each other, and he would stare at me like he was waiting for me to say something and then turn away looking hurt. After that, he's stopped looking at me at all.   Anyways, at first I thought I had the upper hand, but I'm afraid he still has a piece of my heart because I can't seem to stop thinking about him which is the worst feeling in the world.   My question is, WHAT is/was he trying to do?   & I know our relationship seems extreme but we really do care about each other and I want to know how I can get him to open up to me again?

20071213210520AAw3c8K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he not like me at all now or something?	this guy that is like MY best GUY friend and im not HIS best GIRL friend, but he wont reply to me on myspace, we barely talk anymore, we ride the same bus and he wont even look at me. i didnt do anything to him. but im afraid to ask him whats wrong cuz im in 8th grade and hes a freshman and i dont want to be like the annoying younger girl that wont leave him alone, cuz i know i wouldnt like that. so what can i do or say to him that wont make me sound annoying. or should i just leave him a lone for a while and see if he comes to me? idk what to do cuz i really didnt do anything to him, all i did was be nice! i like him like a little bit. not much. please help and he liked me last year so could there BE A SLIM SMALL CHANCE THAT maybe he likes me too? but i doubt it. im confused.

20080608070344AA0et37	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does all this mean?	I'm 17 and i like this girl (for a while) from school, I don't know her well, we have had a few convos on MSN, some of which she started, she shows signs which either suggest that she likes me, or she thinks i like her and isn't interested back and doesn't know how to act.   here are the signs   -gives me sideways glances sometimes, and when i'm speaking to the class she looks at me. (sometimes smiling)   -Seems a bit nervous around me, but at times doesn't seem nervous   -smiles at me when we pass.   -speaks in a kinder, softer voice than what she uses for others   -When shes sitting she faces me, and her legs are crossed and pointed in my direction   - some days she doesn't seem very aware that i'm in the room, she chats a lot to other guys.and doesn't look at me much, thats bad   - something else bad, she put "i don't need a man :) " as her MSN name, this is the point that really confused me   -She has never made that much of an effort to speak a lot to me, both at school and MSN      She seems a nice person, i don't know how shy she is.      If she does like me, she must be unsure about how i feel about her, does this explain some things      What do you think, anything you say will help

20070910125039AArTdQK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this girl nuts?	Last night I made plans with this girl I work with, that we would go to a movie.       I woke up this morning feeling nauseous, and I eventually threw up a couple of times. I told her I couldn't make it today, and she got pissed off with the answer       "If you didn't want to hang out with me, you shouldn't have asked."       Seriously, I don't think a good first impression would be me possibly getting sick at a movie.      Is she nuts or is she right?

20080206013536AAXpALX	Family & Relationships;Family	Chicos necesito ayudar a mi hermana. Los suegros no la aceptan y ella se siente mal. Qué me podrían aconsejar?	Chicos, necesito que me ayuden.-   Mi hermana es muy buena mina, es muy sencilla, es muy responsable, es muy inteligente, es muy seria, etc., etc. Muchos padres dicen que les gustaría que sus hijos varones tengan una novia como ella.-   Bueno, con esto no le quiero hacer propaganda a mi hermana. El problema que ella tiene, es que se puso de novia hace unos 7 meses y sus suegros no la aprecian mucho porque dicen que tiene actitudes como de chiquilina y ella no es así. Tal vez es porque ella es un poco tímida y le cuesta relacionarse con ellos, pero ella se siente muy mal y no sabe que hacer.-   Mi pregunta es ?Cómo puedo hacer para ayudarla? ?Me podrían dar algún consejo para que ella pueda actuar y/o cambiar alguna conducta que ella tenga?   Desde ya, les agradezco muchísimo su participación. Espero que tengan un buen día. Saludos. Federico.-

20081103183134AAFhePo	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Did you elope? how do you feel about your decision?	I haven't talked this over with my boyfriend yet, but after he proposes, I am thinking I would like to elope. My reasons are this:   1. He has a dysfunctional family, i don't want drama ruining things   2. Way cheaper to elope   3. I don't like being the center of attention   4. No planning stress, and we don't have to wait a year to get married      My doubts are:   1. I want to have pictures/memories of the day that include my friends/family   2. No presents, and I have bought A LOT of presents for my friends (I know this sounds greedy, but seriously, I have spent $1000s on all my friends showers, bachelorette, and wedding presents-I feel a bit entitled)   3. Our families might be hurt by this decision      So my question is, if you have eloped, or had a wedding with just the two of you....are you happy with your decision, or regret it?

20071104215750AAia7WB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Transition from one job to another Blues...?	My boyfriend seems finding it hard adjust with the transition from his old job to the new one. He took this initiative after being in a 2-yr sales job that he loves (male company, fun, friendship, nature of the job, interaction) except that the pay is low and he feels he will not be moving up the ladder that's why he transferred to another company. This new one pays well but he is sitting all day (boring), female dominated, no-fun and he is still building up confidence so to speak. He feels really down every morning!!! But as the day goes, he will be alright. It's just the morning blues... it is persistent and he really misses the old job. But he said he cannot go back. I really felt I cannot help him with how he feels on this.. What do you think?

We were friends throughout college, but the last year, we've gotten to know each other very well and have developed a close relationship. we've talked to each other about our relationship and stuff, and lately, it seems like I can't get her out of my mind. I think I love this girl, yet she does not have the same feelings for me. She just wants to stay friends, but of course, I do not. She does have a boyfriend, but I think we hang out more than she does with him. The other day, I talked to her about this and I suggested the best way was to maybe just go our own separate ways. I can't seem to stop thinking about her and this kills me inside, knowing that she doesn't have the same feelings for me. I don't want to stop being friends because our friendship is that great, but at the same time, I'm an emotional disaster because of her. I don't know what to do. I'm scared at the prospect of losing her. Is that the best possible solution for me? Any suggestions on what I should do? Thanks..

20071029102038AAn0elf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which guy to choose?	So I am in a situation...and I'm not sure which guy to be with.      Guy # 1 -- I have known him for 6 years (high school and college sweethearts), we have been on and off throughout those years.  He is not ready to totally commit yet.  He doesn't know if he want kids, and I do (we might not have a future together?) I am comfortable with him, love him, and would be happy with him had this other guy not come into the picture.  I think he does take me for granted.      Guy # 2 -- He is older and ready to settle down.  He wants kids and is intriguing to me.  He has been through alot in his life and I know he would treat me well.  However, I am not that comfortable with him yet (but that should come with time).        Guy # 1 said it would be ok for me to go on a date with guy # 2 (he doesn't see him as a threat) so I did and I had a lot of fun. I think I want to try with guy # 2 but I don't want to hurt guy # 1.

20071022201748AAzd4ky	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	No "spark" when he kisses me?	Ok, so I have been with my boyfriend for a long time now.  I am still attracted to him. We still have sex and make out and stuff, but I was wondering if it is ok/normal to not feel that spark when we kiss anymore?  It feels kind of boring in a way, although I do enjoy it (I am not repulsed or anything).  I just thought of this--I wonder if we are physical because we love eachother--even though there are real sparks/butterflies in the stomach things between us anymore.  We definitely have love for eachother and attraction--I mean we aren't totally lustful after eachother anymore--but we do love to make eachother feel good which is why I think the sex is still great.  So my question is, is it normal to not have the "spark" but still have an attraction after a few years of dating?  Should I be feeling more "into" it?

I have a small crush on this really sweet, really shy guy, the kinda guy you KNOW will not make a first move. he has a g/f and I'm also involved with someone else.   We're really close, but he does things that make me wonder...   -we text all night, everynight and study together everyday   -he always sits next to me or finds someway to include me in whatever he's doing.   -he's brought pancakes into school for me to taste and he's lent me his Ipod and CDs overnight and his jacket when I get cold.   -A few months ago I was talking about how holding hands with someone helps when I have a panic attack and he responds with "let's insite a panic attack" what did that mean? Did he want to hold my hand?   -Today we're trying to study and he's being stupid so I said "Let's get back to work or I'm gonna get all Hermione on your ***" (meaning I was going to get serious and study) and he says, "oohh can I be Ron?" it sounds stupid, but it's obvious that Hermione and Ron get together -

20070905212827AAtQqaS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Tall or short?	okay, so here's the thing. now I know that this is horrible, completely horrible, but I could never go out with a guy who's shorter than me. it would drive me insane, since I'm already self-conscious about being pretty tall in the first place. Now, I'm wondering if most guys who date girls taller than them feel awkward, or if they're comfortable in their own skin. . . . .

20070911185518AAbulvm	Family & Relationships;Family	I moved away w/ a LT boyfriend, broke up w/ him, and decided to stay here.  How can I tell my family?	The break-up was so traumatic, I had nobody to turn to in this strange, new place so of course I called on my mother.  She's wanted me to come back home ever since I left.  But time has passed and I really don't want to move back home after all; I want to try and make it out here on my own.  I know it'll be hard, but there's so much opportunity here compared to where I've moved from.  My family misses me, and I feel so bad that I've had them thinking up to this point that I was moving back home.        What's the best way to tell my mother I want to stay here without hurting her?

Ok tonight I met this guy that is INCREDIBLY sweet. He told me I was beautifull and a ton of other stuff. At first I wasn't sure if he was sincere, and I kinda hinted about it and he told me he wasn't that kind of guy. He used to be really bad, but he has changed his ways now. He has turned to God. One problem.....he's almost 28 and I'm 15. I feel like this is a guy I could fall in love with but I can't because of the age difference. He's even going to write me a poem. He said it would be really hard to write it because they're arn't any words to describe me. My parents would NOT go for this! What should I do?

It's to the point where my parents are asking me why i don't have a girlfriend, and that feels really bad.  I need a change.  I want to meet someone special.  So, i am going to try and come out of my shell and go out to places like the super market and bookstores and try to strike up conversations with women.  Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? does anyone think this is a silly idea?

20081018190702AAe81S9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend help what's up with this?	gotdammit...i'm mad or retarded.  My boyfriend got mad at me the other day for, a million reasons, and once he's mad I have a hard time talking him out of it.  I get to see him about twice a week.  He thought I cut him off on the phone so he decided he didn't want to see me that day text read "Maybe today isn't a great day."  Then he calls to say "Can you drop off that box?" a box that's his in my car.  WOW!  You tell me you can't see me ( I drove an hour to look for jobs near where he lives to be closer to him)...Which maybe is a mistake looking at what's happening now...then he wants me to swing by, without seeing him before I head home.  Breathe easily.  Well, I told him sure, and had just stepped to an interview room and said ok, gotta go bye.  He then proceeded to text me that he was sooo mad.  I'm like ok...i told him no big deal.  I tell him later i'm dropping off the box and he passes me as  i leave his house.  Driving like a maniac.  Then he tells me he saw me.  I wanted to stay but I was thinking that would make the situation worse.  I'm so good at that though.  I tell him later I miss him.  Send him sweet, sexy texts that are all true to how I feel, he then tells me basically he's hot for me, and wants me to come the next day.  Well, I made plans to volunteer for my goddaughter's school.  I told him that I thought that would be an awful thing for me to do.  He said I'm telling you...I'm not asking.  Now, okay... the thing is that I had to stand my ground I told him at first kinda snarky i thought it was pretty selfish to put me in that position, then told him I loved him and I understood he missed me and APOLOGIZED for being obligated.  He then told me to stop texting and he would call when he could.  Then he said "U will have plenty of *Jerry free time"...i'm like that's not what i want...then i call him that night maybe twice, then I call today. Three times today but only left one message very loving, once in the morning, noon, and night.  Text maybe twice.  Then I lost it.  Started crying and called twice more leaving message b/c i'm genuinely heart broken over this.  Don't worry i'm done now.  I mean what should I do?  Is this a game?  He never wanted to play games before and I'm not good at them!  Help!  I'm angry and I don't want to lose my temper (anger control issues), and I'm hurt.  Help me.

20081028193009AARLoXA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will he call me???!!?10 points!?	I made out with my ex-boyfriend last weekend at a party. Later that night he dropped me off at my house and said he wanted to hang out more. And then i said that i didn't want to go out with him, that i wanted to be friends with benefits. He agreed, but now I'm worried he won't call to hang out again. Do guys like having friends with benefits as much as having girlfriends? And do you think he'll call to hang out again?
20080520094945AAQDNZN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, how do you respond to dirty talk?	This is a serious question.  Women claim that they don't like men who talk dirty to them.  However, women like sex too, just as much as men if not more.   Because of this, I understand that women have sexual desires and fantasies too.   Talking dirty helps women release their sexual side however, i am wondering when and where is the best place to do it.        Don't say the bedroom either because everyone knows that the dirty talk starts before you hit the bed.
20080520095858AAKjFGh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, what is the wussiest thing you see in males?	I understand that women do not like men who can be walked upon.  However, women I would like you to list the social feature you find most unattractive about a man.  Example, maybe his voice tone, etc.
20080520100415AA7HQqb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, what is the biggest turn off you see in a man when he starts talking to you?	Many men get approach anxiety simply because some women will not give him the time of day. I am sure many women here have brushed a dude off the minute he trys to start a conversation.  I am wondering, what sparked the innitial turn off?  Is it primarily because of his looks or is it deeper?  I don't think all women are shallow, but there has to be some reason why some women will instantly reject one guy and not another.       PS.  Being drunk is not an answer.   I don't blame you for rejecting a drunk fool.

Finding means, you approach men at any time even without make up or being dressed up.  Waiting for one is the opposite.  Try to doll yourself up and wait for men to approach you.

20080519104034AAm2ISb	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Guy in my life?	I just wanted to see what others thoughts were on this.  I have a guy in my life and two young teens.  I let him stay the night and after the kids went to school.  He was up for the day, and when I got up and went in to the bedroom he came out of my sons room.  He did not know I seen him and he acted like he was coming from the living room into the hall way to say hi.  Some times he seems a bit to nice to kids.  And I worry, why did he lie about being in my sons room?  What was he doing, it was not resting.  He said he was just watching a movie in the living room.  But I knew he was not.  I think I should worry and not have him around me and my sons any more.  What do you think about this and should I ask him?
20080608070540AA5srJU	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is it so hard to make real friendships when you're an adult?	The most you could get is some co-worker who says hi to you everyday, but it's really superficial, and they're not really your friend.

I would like to get married someday, but I want to make sure that I choose the right woman, who is well-adjusted and mature and intelligent.      There are some though, who think that just because you are single, that you are fair game to be paired off with ANYONE. They have this attitude that just because someone walks upright and has a pulse, then they are dateable.      If she has 17 tattoos, is missing most of her teeth, smokes 4 packs a day, and flunked the 4th grade three times, then I don't want to date her.      Does that somehow make me picky or a bad person?

Okay So Theres this girl I really like. She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT).. In Class if the teacher calls my name she will turn around look at me and smile. Sometimes she tells me she loves me but im not sure if shes serious because her friends say it to. We talk mostly on msn and barely at school, but her and her friends always get excited when i show up. We are both going on 17,& recently without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends   who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im getting confused. (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating, eventually she removed the nicknameshe has even called me bro. Now she has a Bf but I dont really think she likes him that much because her msn name is just her name and her friend and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling me she misses me, so does she like and do i still got a chance??? Recently She started saying Hi to me less but 2day in gym I saw her looking at me quite a few times but i Personally thought she liked me but was playing hard 2 get. and recently when she says hi she makes her friends say it to, but Now i think its over:@

20081026220918AAYFtcl	Family & Relationships;Friends	Serious roomate ISsue!!!?	I am a junior in college. I have decided to get an apt this year. My friend is this girl ive known since freshman yr wanted to be my roomate. Problem is I know this girl very well. she is a very good friend. Like when i need her shes always there for me. However..I think that she can be very childish at times. and im really trying to shy away from ppl who act like that. like if me and her have an issue regarding us finding an apt shell talk about it with our mutual friends. and i dont like that because its between us. further more we recently viewed  a 3 bedroom apt. the master bdrm was marvelous so we decided to flip a coin. best of 3. I won the coin toss. then this chick decides she wants to occupy a portion of my room to make it fair since my room is big. blablabla. and I told her no. If you want extra space use the 3rd bedroom. she made a big deal out of it. of course because its definetly her nature. and now she doesnt want to live there anymore. i offered to share that section of my bedroom just to make to shut her up. because shes driving me crazy and we really need to move in asap. and she still didnt want it. now that shes done this im really having a hard time wanting to live with her. i dnt even want to tlak to her because i dont like or appreciate the way she handles ANY situation. And Im in college. and Biology major and I dont have time for the bullshit. I cant find a new roomate because all of my friends are already situated. Im not living with a stranger. and im not renting a "room"..i live in ny. you can just rent a room weekly. but no thanks. a 1 bedroom would be streching my money kinda tight. so the option of me living with her still exhists its just hard because i dont like her attitude and im not in the mood to deal with it. i know for a fact it will ruin our friendship if we move in together. for a fact. shes wayy too bossy and controling and spoiled. and i dont have time to cater to anyone. what should i do? Stick it out with her? or just rough it and get a 1 bedroom. a 1 bedroom is around 1,000.00 and thats really really looking hard. so please any mature insight would be appreciated...      Stressed out in Bklyn.

I have to come up with something good that "I" can make. I am not a horrible cook but I am not an expert either. I don't want to feed him food from a box, I need something simple yet delicious that doesn't take longer than an hour. Any ideas?

20081113215314AAXWf7X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Is the best way to get over somebody you are absolutely crazy about but they don't care about you?	This guy and me were dating for 3 months and our relationship was perfect for the most part. After our three month anniversary, he found out that during the first week of our relationship I had kissed my ex-boyfriend. That was the only "cheating" that I had done throughout the course of our relationship. He dumped me right after I confessed it to him, but we got back together the next week. When we got back together, our relationship was the same. . .it picked up right where we left off. Now, it is a month later and I find out that he has been talking to his ex throughout our whole relationship trying to get her to take him back and she finally agreed. So now they are totally in love and I am soooo brokenhearted. I know that our whole relationship was based on a lie, but I miss him to death and I need to move on but it is too hard. He blames his cheating on my cheating but he cheated first. I feel really bad and I want to hate him but I still like him and I need to move on ASAP

20081115065238AAjvglO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im in love with my teacher who's the same sex?	I'm 18 and shes 45 it's a stupid thing to fall in love with her and i know shes old enough to be my mom. Well i don't know if im in love or if it's just an infatuation. She has recently resigned her post as my r.s teacher and i know longer see her except when i go to her office. I am always talking about her to my friends about how amazing she is. I never realized i had feelings for her until we went on a residential together and the group of us went to a restaurant where she sat with us. She talked about her life and how she had never been in love, shes single but has a son which you can tell she adores. I was heartbroken when she got rid of our class as she hadn't got rid of any of her others. I have to see her or i go mad and shes always in my mind. It's stupid and i shouldn't feel like this but im drawn to her and i know she doesn't feel the same even though i wish she did but i trust her more than anyone else in the college. I have another chance to go to another residential with her should i?any advice?

She isnt a virgin but, she won't sleep with me. we've been together for 1 month and she says its too early. I thought about breaking it off but, my brother and my best friend really like her and tell me that shes a classy girl and if your gonna leave her because of that then, you dont deserve her.

20081216080128AAu8oUA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I divorce my husband?	We've been married 16 years and we have 2 children.  I love him but 2 years ago I found out he had a drug problem.  He started smoking crack with a friend and it nearly bankrupted us.  I found out because I accidentally came home early from work one day and caught them.  I was so upset that I started hitting him and when the police came they arrested me.  Instead of getting me out of jail, he stayed and smoked more crack.  After my parents got me out, my husband went to the hospital to get cleaned up because he didn't want me to leave him.      I agreed to stay married but I am still having a hard time to forgive him.  I am afraid because he still shows alot of the same red flags.  He goes on binges on things like money, food or alcohol. Sometimes he goes shopping without paying the bills, or he eats 25 candy bars in a row, or drinks too much.  He promises me he is not using drugs.      This is so sad.  I feel he loves me, but I think he is sick.  He refuses to go to counseling.  When I try to talk he gets angry and defensive and accuses me of never trusting him.  He watches the clock the moment I start speaking instead of listening.  Now he started sleeping way too much.  The truth is I don't trust him and I'm so afraid and very sad.  I don't know how to fix this, so I think I should just leave.  I tried so hard to keep my family and home together.

20090223141812AA32kBq	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why does my friend lie to me so much?	we started high school this year, and she's met this guy that she REALLY likes, but he's turned her down, twice :/      i personally think that deep down the guy likes her, but he's too scared to date her, because they act like they're bf/gf, just without the official title.      anyways, the other day, she came up and told me about how the guy told her that there were rumors about him getting her pregnant, which he didn't. so we started laughing about it, and i nominated myself to me the godmother of the baby! so then, we walk up to the guy in the hall, and i was like, "hey, guess who the godmother of your baby is!" and he looked at me like he was confused, and she looked at me and said, "shh, be quiet!" and looked back at him and was like, "oh, i forget to tell you that people have been saying you got me pregnant!"      but she had told me, that he was the one who told her! so wouldn't he know that he had told her? i've caught her in so many lies like this, that it's not even funny! and the thing is, there were no rumors about her at school, because honestly, half the school doesn't even know who she is!      it frustrates me soooo bad that she has to lie about the stupidest stuff to make herself seem more important than she really is! i mean, why would a person do that?
20090223141757AAgcZ1e	Family & Relationships;Friends	I cannot stand his friend! Advice needed.?	My boyfriend and I have been dating exclusively for some time now. Most of his friends and family are delightful, fun, and interesting people. They are reflective of the person I see him as, worldly, funny, easy going, and intelligent.       I recently met one of his friends from from college--that was none of these things. He speaks in slangs. He is kind of rude. He prefers to have my boyfriend to himself when he is in town and has said this.        Being a "guys girl" I am a strong believer of guys night out without interference. Initially my boyfriend had invited me along and I declined the offer. (This is before  ets call him "Steve" arrived).       Steve want my boyfriend to himself, and said so. How do I know?       In the 3 days Steve visited from out of town...he kept my boyfriends company to the point he could not have private phone calls. One night as I thought I was privately talking to my boyfriend. And as he was explaining we should meet tomorrow to give Steve and I a chance to know each other, Steve was so close he grabbed the phone.    And proceed to talk about very personal an uncomfortable subject matter.       As my boyfriend regain the telephone, I asked for a moment of his time---to be informed that would be rude to Steve.  ( I really wanted to tell him that was out of line in private but Steve was not going any where.)       For the rest of the weekend, they missed appointments to meet for lunch (they overslepted).  I could not call my boyfriend without Steve being in the background...and when I made note of it--I was made to feel like the rude one because Steve was in town so infrequently.       I am not just annoyed. I am slightly disgusted. If I saw this side of my boyfriend when I met him I would have kept going.       Please give me advice. I am about to meet him in two hours. And this is the first time I have seen him since Steve arrived. Yes! Steve just left Monday. (What weekend guest doesn't leave Monday morning the latest but hangs out until Monday mid afternoon.)

A few days ago, a guy I know from a class and hadn't spoken to in months sent me a message out of the blue telling me he wanted to have sex with me. What should I do? Should I just go for it or play hard to get so that he doesn't think I'm a slut? I know this sounds like a dumb question but I would really like the feeling of a man and I would really like to get laid. It's been a while. I just don't want to come off a slut and be disrespected.

Neither of us want a relationship as we have just gotten out of long relationships. Before we had sex he wanted to be together when we are ready- I said I don't know. Then we have sex- and he changed his mind, he doesn't want to think about the future.   So fine, we agreed to be in an open relationship. Then like 3 days later I changed my mind, and just wanted to be friends- and if sometimes we have sex- fine. Then we had sex again, and I changed my mind again, and we agreed to just be sex-free friends. Now I want to have sex with him again. What the eff do I want?!? Or should we just remain as sex-free friends?      The friendship works GREAT.

20081216055752AAIDtoY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you believe in True fated love/ soulmates?	Ive always longed for a love of two inspired individuals, fatefully drawn to each other and ready to risk their lives for the other person’s sake - in essence, Romeo and Juliet. Do you believe that this truly exists? I know we can all feel like this in the beginning of a relationship...as I have as well. Then the reality sets in, and years later, that love turns to a "friendship" love or a "committed" love and changes. Is this the way you believe love is? Whats your meaning of true love and do you believe in the fairytale love? And Im not talking about the love of a child. I mean romantically. Thanks :)

20090211124858AAXfRN1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you have lunch with someone and lead them to think you were single?	I know a guy that is contracted throughugh my company. We talk on the  about work related things but lately he would flirt and say things like you look great or put in babe and sexy in the conversation. Last week he asked me if i wanted to go to lunch. So today we went out, he was upset he was 10min late, he bought, we ate and talked about our family, where we have lived and such, I ask if he has kids and he said yes 3 (which is fine b/c i have one too) then i asked if he was divorced and he said no i'm married. (8years). WTF. so didn't want to make a big deal about it but he totally led me on. after i called him and i asked him about it and he said he was sorry but im so beautiful and blah blah. he said i hope this doesn't mess things up i had a great time and want to meet up again. why would he lead me on like that?
20090223135812AAFC86G	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is he manipulating me again?	I have a son whom I believe is an addict.  Not that he has admitted to it.  He is homeless some of the time and doesn't keep a job.  I no longer help him out when he needs it.  I know that he lies, manipulates and uses people to get them to take care of him.  I have been keeping tabs on him by looking at his Myspace page.  In this last week and a half I have stopped doing that as well. Since I no longer keep tabs on him, he has texted me 3 different times.  Once to tell me that he had found clothes behind the Salvation Army and was getting ready to bed down outside. (Kansas is very cold in the winter), the 2nd text was to tell me he had been roughed up my an ex-friend, and this last one (all on different days) was to tell me he had 15 teeth extracted at a free dental fair.  This last thing upset me the most.  I don't know whether he is testing the waters or what is going on.  It doesn't seem like this could be true.  What dentist would do that?  Why would my son lie?  I will know the next time I see him, if he lied.  I live out of state.  So, do you think he's pulling my strings?
20081122100440AAITuMI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy problems... HELP!?	so about 3 weeks ago i asked this question to c if other ppl thought he liked me.      Does he like me even after homecoming, which was last sat?   im a junior in hs and this guy, Lets say his name is bob, asked me to homecoming by giving me a dozen roses, a rose balloon and a box of chocolates. we went to homecoming and had a great time. he was definitely putting some moves on me. we grinded and held hands a lot and we aren't dating but were kinda acting like it. and so i like him and i thought me might ask me out. but he is acting like nothing ever happened between us. he acts the same in math class like he did before homecoming. what happened??      i definitely made sure he knew i had a great time at homecoming and i even asked him what he was doing this weekend.      NOW that its been 3 weeks still nothing has happened. a few weeks ago he asked me what i was doing over the weekend and i had soccer tournaments for the next 2 weekends then when those were over he went to michigan to visit his sister at college that following weekend. NOW this weekend he asked me if i wanted to hang out so i texted him to see what he wanted to do and he said he didn't know. and i still dont know if he likes me so idk if he wants to hang out in a group or with just me. and just because that was frustrating me i asked him in a text but he never responded. im so confused help!

20081121114143AABLMli	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he cheated?	My ex boyfriend (W.) isn't admitting to me that he cheated, however I heard otherwise. He is with a girl right now (B.) and he says he just started seeing after we broke up. I was fine with this. Her ex (R.) messaged me the other day and said that I was cheated on for about 2 months and until we broke up, and he knows because he was cheated on too with my ex. I was totally shocked, called my ex and was like did this happen. He denied it - texting, talking, messaging, calling, or doing anything physical (even kissing). I dropped it and believed my ex. Long story short, B. (my ex's current girlfriend) messages me and says that in fact yes they did sleep together while him and I were together. I call my ex and am like, what! she told me herself. He still denies it, stating that her ex (R.) must have logged into her account and sent me those messages. He's saying that R. is manipulative etc and is lying to me and HE is the one taking advantage of me. Obviously someone is lying to me. I asked if I could talk to B. herself to find out the truth he said he didnt know, he'd call me back. He called me back and said she would be ok with it, but me manipulated me to the point that i didn't even get her number - he manipulated me to even question why was I even wanting to talk to her anyway. After this, R. messaged me with B's number and said you can talk to her, she actually wants to talk to you. I called B. and she told me everything - said they had been together. She said she had messaged me earlier and actually told me exactly what she said in the message. Granted, I know she could definitely lie. She did say though that he didn't want to tell me (about them being together) because he wanted to protect me and not hurt me (which I know is something he would say even though it doesn't make logical sense because it's not like that makes lying right). After we talked, she messaged me and said that she told W. that we had talked and that he may actually be honest with me now. I just don't know what to think. Obviously there is a big flaw in his story - that R. was making everything up (because when I talked to B. on the phone she told me everything that Richard said and more). I just wish I could hear it from her mouth and wonder if I ever will. Do you think he cheated on me? 
20090216172943AA4ZUAq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Songs about being with someone and no one wants you to be together?	So.. I am with my boyfriend and no one really wants to see us together. I am from a rich family and he is from a broken home. I love the way he treats me and he loves the way I treat him. The only problem is our families. His family thinks I am snobby (because I have more money I think) and my mom thinks I could do better (and should find someone who could financially support me). What are some good songs like this? Romeo and Juliet type songs. I already know "Bleeding Love" and "Don't Matter" by Akon...any other ideas? THANKS!
20090208111123AAL6mSi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Best friend mad about me and her ex?	About a year ago, one of my best friends went out with our guy best friend and they went out for like two weeks.   Recently for like 2 months he's been saying cute things to me and I really like him now. Just last night there was a Vday dance and he was my date. The week before, he "told" my best friend that he just wanted to be friends with me. But last night he kissed me a lot and now I think my friend is mad at me because ive been thinking that shes not over him. She hasnt told me anything about it so I cant change what happened or how I feel about him now.    Also right before she went out with him last year, my other two best friends had gone out with him.       Now she's telling me that I should've checked with her first and I know i should have but she never did for our other two friends.      And shes telling all of our friends and probably him about all this so my friends will hate me and he will probably say that we shouldnt go out because of this.      What am I supposed to do??
20081221123940AADiqcy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When will i stop HATING my ex boyfriend?	OMG, this is a doosie!  He breaks up with me for a variety of reasons, all of which I understand, we fight.  I want my things back and he says I ruin his day when I call, and I say well, just tell me when I can have my things and I'll leave you alone, then he's like "**** you" i'm blocking your number.  He says I don't care what you do!  I say "well if you care about if i call you care about what I do."  He tells me I'm a goner, I say I just want my things, he says that's my problem b/c I'm insane I can't have them back. I positively HATE him right now, and I can't remember wanting to be more insane.  I have the urge to do terrible things to him.  I want to be violent.  He called me asking to talk and I said I was busy.  Now he's saying stop calling me, your stalking me, but I'm like you're just mad I couldn't come to meet you for "closure" that day.  I just need some advice from someone who has loved someone with every fiber of their being, even thought about marriage to being told that they were the biggest mistake ever and posting passive aggressive things on myspace.

I have no reason (good OR bad) for getting a girlfriend, but I still do. This bothers me. I'm not a very emotional person and don't think that it would do me any good to find someone to whom I could relate my feelings, even if I somehow was able to. I'm not governed by my hormones, so it's certainly not about the physical side of things. I don't want to have power over someone else, so it's not that. I don't know if I would want to have to stay in close contact with someone on a day-to-day basis. Most girls don't interest me anyways because they don't live up to my high moral standards; in fact, I refuse to date 99% of girls out there because they're not good enough for me. Why, then, might I still want to find a girlfriend?

20081216062605AAesVGt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Preacher Husband looking at porn? ?	I'm a newlywed, My husband and I have been together total for just over a year now, and have been married for 6 months of that time. He's my everything and treats me like I'm the queen of the world. I do however have one issue, it is about porn. Now, just to set a few things straight, I don't believe its ok, and I've read some similar posts and some answers were like well, would you rather him looking at porn, or going to pick up a chick? I would appreciate not getting these responses because honestly, neither one is acceptable to me. So that kind of answer is irrelavant.    Here's the deal. We're both Christians, he's in a christian music ministry, and completely devoted.    I was in bed one night and he was up looking for videos on youtube of a band he used to play in. I verified this, because I checked all of the history, and I being a computer geek, and knowing computers inside out, still found the history of everything that was done even though he had erased the "browser history". Anyhow, on the videos that came up in the "related videos" was a man "lotioning up" a playboy girl...He says he wanted to check it out to see why it was related to the band's videos, and this I do believe. You'd just have to know my pc illiterate naive little husband. The problem is after he watched it and realized that it had nothing to do with the band, he got the girl's name off the video and looked up more videos with her. The next morning, I had no intentions of spying on him, because I'd never have believed he'd have done anything like this in the first place, but I was looking for something else, and came across the history of these videos and ask him about them. He lied to me. The first time in our relationship that he's lied to me. I knew it immediately, because he and I are the only ones with access to this pc, and I most certainly hadn't searched for and watched the videos. This was on a Sunday morning and suddenly I didn't feel like going to church with him, after I realized that he'd done this and then lied to me. (background info: he at one time in the past, NOT during our relationship but while he was single had a problem with porn, but he has told me on numerous occasions how he had felt so convicted about it and prayed for God to help him out of this "addiction" and shortly there after we started going out, so he's always told me I was his "answer". ) So anyways, when he gets home from church, he breaks down and admits that it was him, and that he lied to me. He said that all through church he couldn't quit thinking about it and felt so terrible for doing that, and then lying, because NEVER lying to me was always something he had been proud of.      A while back we had actually discussed porn, and how it was completely against everything the bible stood for, and how hypocritical it was to be in church and watch these types of things, and I even mentioned to him how degrading it was, and how much it destroyed the woman. Thats one of my biggest problems in this whole situation.       Now that you know all the history, heres why I'm here. I know what he done was wrong, and I know that he is truly sorry. He has definitely made up for it over and over again. But, in my own mind I still can't get over it. I know I need to forgive him and move on, and I try not to bring it up to him, but its completely destroyed my self image. The fact that he talks about how nasty girls are that would do anything like that, and he would still look at those girls when I was laying in the next room. It's given me some trust issues with him too. I've always had trust issues with everyone, but not him, because he has completely proven to me that I could trust him, until this incident. I know he's a man and he's human, so I'm not so much mad at him, as I'm just taking it out on myself. It's left me with this feeling of not being good enough to keep him happy, and when we make love now, I can't help but wonder if he'd rather be with one of those girls. I cry when he's not around from thinking about it. I don't feel pretty anymore, because if I were pretty enough he'd be able to get all that he needs from me. The worst part is that I don't eat anymore, and I've even started doing the stupid things like throwing up after I HAVE to eat. I can feel myself becoming more and more unattractive as I eat, and every time I do eat, I just remember how much prettier those women are than myself. Now I'm just 21, I've played sports my whole life, and I've always been in good shape, though I have in the last year or 2 gained some weight, but I never felt ugly, not like I do now. He's 35, and I try so hard to be perfect for him. I guess I just feel like this has shown me that I'm not, and I cant stand the fact that I can't be good enough for him. We even discussed the whole Biblical standpoint on whether it was cheating or not. Jesus says that who so ever shall look upon another woman and lust after her has committed adultery already in his heart. Now I'm not

20081220143431AANebXy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Am I So Nerves To Do Sexual Things With My Girlfriend??????????????????	Hello         Well me and my girlfriend have been dating for a year and 5 days (since december 16) well i have been to her house and i have fingered her once.       Im in high school and all the time i get so much crap like " You've been dating for a year and you ain't hit that?!" like that's all i hear. ( i am a  freshman) and so many other kids have done so much more and i'm 16 and their like 15 and it amazes me at times.      Like yes i love my girlfriend with all my heart and i would do anything for her, but whenever i think about having sex with her or eating her out or something sexual i get so nervous why?      I think a main thing for me is that i don't want to look like an idiot and mess up or something, and i don't want that at all. she is a virgin and so am i so we don't really know anything.      How come with any other sexy girl i could see myself doing things to them but not things with her because im nervous? Like i can just see that with myself, like theres this girl kristen the most sexiest girl ever i wouldn't date her and i don't love her i could just do things to her but not my current girlfriend.      Tell me why about all this!   Please   Thank You!!!      =]

20081220163628AA2FGsL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my girlfriend so upset over the death of my father?	My dad passed away suddenly a few months ago after being very sick. I have accepted it slightly, but my girlfriend hasn't. Her mom was killed by her dad when she was young, so she grew up with her grandparents. She always told me and my dad that, my dad was the closest thing she has ever had to a dad. They were close, but not extremely close. He would cry in front of her, hug her, comfort her, like a dad.      We were supposed to get married in February, but now were aren't. She said "I just can't get married right now, it wouldn't be right with your dad not being there." She was supposed to walk down the aile with my dad, and doesn't want to walk with anyone else. She has also started crying because he won't be there to see his first grandchild, and that is a special moment for her.      Why is she getting so upset over the death of my father, what can I do to help her? We are both 21 if it helps. There is nothing wrong with getting married at 21. My parents were married when they were 18. Me and my girlfriend have been going out for 7 years.

20090118181517AAwOYkl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a man be just friends with a woman that he has romantic feeling for?	I went on a date with a man that I really like.  I decided that I didn't want to be romantic with him but I really want to be his friend.  We didn't see each other for over a month but finally made plans to get together.  We had a great time together and it was really nice to have a guy to hang out with and not have any romantic pressure.        At the end of the night he got all gushy and romantic on me.  He kissed me  and it was really hard for me because I don't want to go there with him.  I explained that I wont be able to see him if he can't hold it together and respect the fact that I don't want to date him.      He's a great guy and I don't want to lose him as a friend.  I will never date him because there are certain aspects of his life that I just don't agree with.        Is it likely that he wont be able to just be friends with me?

20090223101932AAtopWP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Complacent. I dont know what to do. I dont know how I feel. I dont know if he cares.?	I feel like me and my husband have gotten to a complacent stage in our marriage. We have been married for 2 years, and together for 4 years.      He has always been the un-romantic type. And he is just not that into sex. Once or twice a week is good for him, when I like more. It sometimes causes a lot of fights because I need more physical stuff from him- romantic dates, nice strokes or etc. Sometimes I just feel like he gets me off because it his job.      Or relationship side is good- but no great. We dont fight, we have fun, we enjoy our life. We are both young (21, and 24). We dont have financial problems, and everything gets done around the house, and dont fight at all about that stuff.       The only thing we do fight about is the sex thing (which is more of a discussion) which I have tried over the past 4 years to talk to him calmly, go to counseling, we have tried everything on that aspect, but it just doesnt getter better. no changes.       The other thing I have feelings about is the closeness. Sometimes I feel like his best friend, but that I dont have any importance. Like I just dont feel close- like a romantic connection. Sometimes I just feel like we are best friends that hang out and talk and chill together all the time      What should I do? I have talked to him, discussed things, gave him time, helped him, gave hints about stuff, and etc. I try my best not to nag about the issue, and thats why we have done so well. I use to nag about it, but it got me no where, and would just make us fight more, so I stopped. I have written him a nice letter, texts, etc. Everything. it just honestly never changes on his part.      Since its been so long, I kinda give up. I kinda realize maybe this is the way it will be, but it still upsets me, and makes me down a lot.       Im not sure If I should feel a different way or try something different.       Anything will help thanks.

20090223151132AANL5Du	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married living with friends, in law and kids Helppppp?	My wife and I got married 2 and a half years go. We have a single male friend coming to live with us for like a few months before he takes up a job in China. Then we have one of our girlfriends who cant pay her rent wanting to move in 2 months time with her 4 yr old daughter. Then my wifes sister will be moving in, in  two months with her 4 year old son. I am not lying, I am not looking fwd to this arrangement. I dont know hot propose to my wife that her sister and her son( whom i both love) would be best with her parents. My sis in law will be in extensive college for 2 years full time with no time for work. But I just cant even imagine coming home to my wife and her sister and our female friend and their kids. I love cooking, will I have to now cook for wife n me n two females n their kids? Or do i just stop cooking all together? I couldnt stand in the kitchen n make myself n wife something to eat n not make anyone else especially the kids something to eat. I enjoy my privacy of coming home and walking naked or just spoiling my wife with my culinery skills. I dont want to have to fogure out what 3 women n 2 kids r gonna eat. I dont want to feel like a man with 3 wives and 2 children. Or am i just being insensitive? I like coming in and watching what i wanna watch on Tv. How about coming home to find 3 women watching female shows? How about 3 women on pms? When my other sister in law was living with us, her dad( dad in law) had said he would like her to move out and go live with him and her mom. I think he was of the view that a marriage needs privacy to thrive. I dont know how to handle this situation. I want to do it diplomaticaly. I never see a need to ruffle feathers. Has anyone ever been in this situation before and how did they handle it?
20090223152221AALUl5Y	Family & Relationships;Friends	Big issue in our friendship?	I have a really close friend who is amazing and i love her to bits, the problem is she has a lot going on in her life and tends to be really depressed most of the time. I have a lot goin on too and having her around me doesn't help because it makes me feel worse that a close friend is upset too.      I tried to avoid her a bit but its really hard, when I'm at school that when I can take my mind off my problems, but for my friend school is where quite a few of her problems are so she will always be upset and it really brings me down and I can never be truly happy when I'm with her.      I would tell her all this but there's a glitch my friend has attempted suicide before, stepping out into the road when a car comes, drowning herself in the bath, overdoseing on tablets and she self harm. One of the things she often says to me is "your one of the main things keeping me in this world" how can I tell her I don't want to be friends when she says this?
