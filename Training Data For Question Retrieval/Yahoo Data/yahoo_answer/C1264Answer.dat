Ue5NoJOgaa	Be careful with this question, many dominant genes are weeded out of the population, for instance 6 fingers (five fingers and a thumb) is actually dominant to the four fingers and a thumb system we are all used to.  So just because something is "rare" doesn't mean it isn't dominant.|`|a187a1dd7cba35d08c7640222ef780c1aa	You have two copies of each gene, one from your mom, one from your dad. A dominant gene means even if you only have one copy from one parent, it will exert its effects. For recessive genes, you have to have both copies to get an effect.|`|pwE4ZVn6aa	For most genes, you have two copies of each gene. A dominant allele (allele=a particular version of a gene) is one where you only need one copy of that version to cause some kind of effect.  If its recessive, then you need two copies of that version to show the effect.  So, lethal recessive genes can "hide" in some generations - if you only have one copy, nothing happens to you, and you could pass that gene on to your children and so on.  If the lethal gene is dominant, it has no place to hide - one copy and you are dead, no chance to pass it on to your children.  Therefore, lethal dominant alleles get cleared out of the population much faster than lethal recessives.|`|SwAfXzaraa	Lethal dominant genes are nearly impossible to find because then having one of the gene kills you. And when an organism dies from its lethal gene, it cannot reproduce and pass the gene onto its kin. However, recessive genes exist because they can be passed down if they are found in a person carrying both the recessive and dominant gene. <br>  <br>  D is a dominant lethal gene.

YB6shxezaa	Many people have unusual and distinct experiences of different realities at some point in their lives, without being impaired or even distressed by these experiences. For example, many people have experienced visions of some kind, and some have even found inspiration or religious revelation in them. As a result, it has been argued that psychosis is not fundamentally separate from normal consciousness, but rather, is on a continuum with normal consciousness.In this view, people who are clinically found to be psychotic may simply be having particularly intense or distressing experiences|`|BjQcwGSLaa	I see, you mean this kind of wind...|`|AA10631668	Beans and cabbage have been known to cause a person's wind.Controling it can sometimes be difficult.I'm not sure if one can cause trees to dance in their wind though.It must get quite stuffy controling your wind sitting in your room.|`|24H5tznkaa	You're not controlling the wind.

SvmZlLdaaa	The tiger is the largest and strongest of all cats, weighing up to 660lb. Lions are the second largest cats, weighing up to 550lb. However, a battle between a lion and a tiger could go either way. There are numerous records of fights between these species, since many people in the past have wanted the answer to this question and tried to settle it by cruelly pitting tigers and lions against each other. In some cases the tiger wins, in some cases the lion. The outcome of such a fight depends on the individuals involved - their age, size, sex, health, experience, temperament, etc. Tigers are larger and stronger, but size and strength are not the only determining factors - a large but timid tiger would be likely to lose to a small but aggressive lion, even though it was stronger. Lions generally have more fighting experience - they often clash with other prides, whereas tigers tend to avoid conflict whenever possible.<br>  <br>  Just for the record, male lions DO hunt - they sometimes join the females, especially when hunting large prey like buffalo, and young males who have left their natal pride but not yet taken over one of their own have no choice but to hunt for themselves. The main reason the females do most of the hunting is that the role of the male is to defend the pride from invading males - he must save his strength for fighting. So the fact that lionesses do most of the hunting, whilst male tigers must hunt for themselves, does not put the male lion at a disadvantage in a fight with a tiger. If anything, it gives him an advantage.<br>  <br>  Also, a single lion, male or female, is quite capable of hunting by itself. Lions hunt in groups because they are more likely to be successful that way, and it also means they can take down bigger prey - for example, giraffes and even elephants on occasion.<br>  <br>  The tiger has the advantage of size and strength, whilst the lion has the advantage of (generally) greater fighting experience and, in the case of the male, the protection afforded by his mane. Both animals have about the same speed and agility, and razor-sharp claws. The tiger's jaws are a little stronger, and its teeth a little larger, but this doesn't make much of a difference, since a bite in a vital area would mean death to either animal. As I said, it really depends on the individuals involved.|`|SWxnbKyyaa	Interms of jaw power both have equal power of 1000pounds per square inch....but the tiger due to its larger size and muscle power gets stronger than the lion|`|EgPpkdXQaa	if we are talking flat out male tiger vs. male lion, prime of their lives, I would say the tiger is stronger, because male lions are not needed so much for strength and speed as for weight. The male lion will come in during a pride hunt and deliver the killing blow to a buffalo or baby elephant, but otherwise he just lazes around and has the lionesses do his hunting. Tigers have to hunt for themselves, and even though they tend to go after the easy kill, they are likely in better condition than the lion.<br>  Moot point anyway. There isn't much of a genetic difference between the two anyway, they can interbreed to make lygers.|`|xJ2HwTdyaa	It's a difficult question.<br>  <br>  Tigers are slightly bigger.  On the other hand, the tiger focuses on hunting prey, while the male lion largely defends the pride from other lions (and sometimes hyenas).

RgSCstkAaa	I am sure you feel much better for that little rant, which, if I understand it aright, implies that nobody is responsible for any of their actions, which are determined entirely by their body chemistry. If that is what you believe, then you will be when understanding when I come and burn your house down because that is in my body chemistry.<br>  <br>  In fact society has evolved through an understanding of appropriate relationships between its members (understanding the concepts of right and wrong confers a benefit on the members, even at the expense of a limitation of freedom). I will happily give up the freedom to murder you for the benefit that you no longer have the freedom to murder me.<br>  <br>  Society now has to deal with those who transgress the rules. We can separate out the ill from the merely deviant, an important classification, because we can pass the ill persons to a process of treatment, and the otherwise deviant to a process of justice. The fact that medical treatment sometimes fails does not disturb this philosophy. This is where classification comes in. If the medical profession says "Yes, you are sick, and yes, we can help" then that is excellent. Sometimes it is "Yes, you are sick, but we don't know how to cure". This is less satisfactory, but it is not a failure of the principle that if you can classify correctly, you are more likely to devise an appropriate management.<br>  <br>  I am not an expert on paedophilia, but if the experts in mental health  do not classify it as an illness, then I, along with the rest of society,  will accept that opinion as being the best available. The fact that we have not achieved a consensus on foetal development (or the existence of life on other planets) is an irrelevance.<br>  <br>  I note your demand for "conclusive studies". I hate to say this, but do you have a sufficient understanding of the scientific process? Yes evolution is a theory, but the experimental evidence is such that it has  a probability of more than 99.99% of being the truth. If you don't understand the degrees of probability, then you have to rely on someone else's understanding.

WkWedRnoaa	The real reason is that putting people into space is an extremely dangerous and risky task which will probably remain so for another century.  The space shuttles used by the United States are large, complex machines made up of millions of parts with thousands of possible points of failure that could lead to the loss of the vehicle or the death of the astronauts aboard.  Compared with the capsules that the Soviets/Russians have used to orbit their cosmonauts, and the capsules used by the US in the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs, the space shuttles expose the astronauts to a much greater risk because the shuttles are massively more complex than the capsules.  We use the shuttles because politically and financially we've been stuck with them since the decision in the early 70's to develop and fly them.  They were a wonderful idea ("space truck") whose creation, development, and flights have been a constant juggling act between safety and mission success.  The original estimates of flying 25 shuttle flights a year at a cost of $25 million  USD each was never realized.  Five or six flights a year at a cost of half a billion dollars has become the norm.<br>  <br>  The blame for the disaster can be put on NASA administrators, engineers, technicians, suppliers, or on bureaucracy, bad luck, karma, or "the odds".  But what it comes down to is that mounting an extremely complex machine onto a bottle loaded with millions of gallons of explosive fuel, strapping on a pair of giant roman candles, lighting it up and having it go from 0 to 100 in 8 seconds, then through a buffetting atmosphere at speeds 10 times those of a rifle bullet, orbiting at 17000 miles per hour in a vacuum, then smashing back into an increasingly dense atmosphere that heats the shuttle to 5000 degrees, imposing deceleration of several gravities, and putting extreme atmospheric pressure on the whole thing, is now and always will be an extremely dangerous task being performed by faulty people doing the best job they can to preserve the lives of people they know well personally and call friends.<br>  <br>  As Forrest Gump says, "..it happens".|`|QPWjtDzcaa	You are asking about the Space Shuttle  Columbia disaster.<br>  <br>  Here's a very abbreviated version:<br>  <br>  During take-off, a piece of insulating foam hit and damaged a wing on the craft.  <br>  <br>  Since foam break offs had occurred before, the risk analysis team didn't put enough concern into this detail.<br>  <br>  The damage was extensive enough, however, that during reentry, the extensive heat created quckly dismantled the wing, and the shuttle was torn apart.<br>  <br>  For a more detailed explaination:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shutt...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/foia/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/foia/index....</a>|`|5fcM3HLsaa	Why are you suspicious of the official explanation?

The chloroplast/ chlorophyll is the pigment. It absorbs the sunlight generating sugar molecules.|`|qozdiWpIaa	Photosynthesis occurs in plant / tree leaves. From light (say Sun) photons (say "hv") are absorbed by the chlorophyll substance on the sun-ward side of leaves. CO2 (carbon dioxide) from air is breathed into the plant / tree leaves by the cells on their bottom. Water (H2O) is brought from streams in the earth by the roots and is passed through stem to the leaves by osmotic pressure. When sun shines or when light falls from any source on chlorophyll of the leaves, water and Carbon dioxide combine together in presence of light energy to form Carbohydrates and release oxygen (O2) into the air. So the Photosynthesis is a process of the production of food for biosphere and of oxygen for the atmosphere. This is the natural factory that God made on earth to sustain and maintain life on earth. In fact the amount of CO2 is reduced and amount of O2 is increased by Photosynthesis process.|`|I1yZIBrQaa	Chloroplasts|`|Gi2XpTygaa	In the photo shop.|`|dV9aJC0kaa	in plant cells

X4EBNoNUaa	assuming the acid is monoprotic ( contains only one acidic hydrogen ) <br>  then place a known volume of the acid solution  in a flask add an indicator like phenolphthalein and then from a burette add slowly a sodium hydroxide solution of known concentration ( such as 0.1 N or M) until there is a permanent pink in the solution. The indicator phenolphthalein will change from colorless to pink at pH ~ 8.2 and is uite red at pH 9. The first permanent pink tells you that you are very near the equivalence point..that is the place at which the amount of added base is exactly equal to the amount of acid present.<br>  <br>  Then determine the concentration this way<br>  <br>  vol base x N(M) base = mmoles of base<br>  <br>  at equivalence point ( the indicator assessed point ) mmoles of acid =<br>  mmoles of base  so let's say you used 18 mL of 0.1 N(M) NaOH to get the pink and you had 50 mL of the acid solution..the number of mmoles of acid present = 18(0.1 )= 1.8 mmoles    mmoles /mL = moles /liter = M  sooo 1.8 mmoles /50 mL = O.036 M<br>  <br>  Proof  Vol base X N(M) base = Vol acid x N(M) acid<br>  <br>  18 X 0.1 = 50 X 0.036 = 1.8 mmoles<br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE   the NaOH for the titration can be "standardized , i.e. its concentration determined by using the same technique as above with the acid being a WEIGHED amount of a crystalline acid like potassium acid phthlate ( KHPH)...make a solution of ~ 0.1 N(M) NaOH by dissolving 4 grams of NaOH in ~ 800 mL of boiled and cooled DI water in a volumetric flask( to remove CO2 ) add the 4 grams, swirl..allow to cool ( NaOH will heat the water a bit.). Dilute to the mark. Using this solution in the burette add it slowly to a solution of a known weighed amount of KHPH containing phenolphthalein indicator until you get the first permanent pink.<br>  <br>  then the concentration of the NaOH can be determined by<br>  <br>  mmoles of KHPH = Vol base x N(M) base  so if for instance you use<br>  a weighed sample of KHPH of 0.288 grams and it took 14.88 mL of NaOH to get to the pink then the NaOH N(M) = 0.288 / 14.88 mL x 0.20423 ( the mmolecular weight of KHPH) = 0.0948 N(M) for the NaOH|`|Ad1qvQtuaa	use an indicator like universal indicator... then compare the resultant colour change of the acid + indicator to the colour chart, which will give you its pH level.

4f234d5b9bdc58fdad5bc1df7ffadcd7aa	The 2 parts of the particle theory of matter are;<br>  1. Photoelectric Effect, and<br>  2. The Compton effect.<br>         In the photoelectric effect, it was shown that when light falls on a metal surface, electrons are emitted from the surface. Similarly when X-ray is allowed to fall on the surface of thin sheet of metal like gold, the X-ray not only produces diffraction pattern but also acting like particles they may collide with atoms of the metal and eject electrons as in the photoelectric effect.<br>       In the compton effect when a single X-ray photon collides with a free electron, the electron recoils off as though it were a perfectly elastic sphere. This is the compton effect. In this effect, the scattered photon has a slightly lower frequency than the incident X-ray photon. In this phenomenon, matter in form of X-rays is show to behave as a particle. The recoiling photon and electron are able to conserve energy and momemtum.
AA12187933	Charles Babbage (26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English mathematician, philosopher, mechanical engineer and (proto-) computer scientist who originated the idea of a programmable computer. Parts of his uncompleted mechanisms are on display in the London Science Museum. In 1991, working from Babbage's original plans, a difference engine was completed, and functioned perfectly. Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked. Nine years later, the Science Museum completed the printer Babbage had designed for the difference engine; it featured astonishing complexity for a 19th century device.|`|9575d31c42a42e99f35b6103c766c7bcaa	The Arithmetic Engine.

3369d2be7aa68e24e1d5a8097d378f3daa	Maggots are fly larvae. Flies land on the body, lay eggs, and the larvae feed until they hatch. The the cycle repeats itself.  Maggots also appear in open wounds and can actually heal the wound in<br>  some cases.<br>  <br>  If a person dies in a  special kind of sealed clean room, maggots would not appear unless the fly larvae were already there. If they died outside the room and were brought in, the eggs were already laid. Worms only appear in a corpse if it is outside and has been lying on the ground for a long time and they have just crawled in. The botlfly is the worst kind and gets under the skin of live pets and causes diseases that even humans contract from them or from rubbish left in the garden that begins to rot where maggots can be found.   <br>  <br>  Maggots eat flesh, bad flesh, good flesh, red flesh, blue flesh. They do not know when to stop eating, the buffet never closes as far as they are concerned. In order to stop the process of tissue removal, the maggots have to be washed out with a sterile fluid. The British Army has, in its manual for special forces, espoused the method of flushing the wound with a fresh stream of urine when clean, red blood and flesh appear, to get the maggots out. I suspect hospitals use a saline solution or something like that. Generally,maggots take longer to turn into flies than is neccessary for the wound to be cleaned, and if they did, they'd leave behind shells which would infect the wound further, so No, they don't just turn into flies and fly away. In summary, flies are attracted by the smell of rotting flesh, which is why they lay their eggs there. However, if the rotting flesh is on a still- living being, the maggots will still gestate and begin eating, being oblivious to the fact that their dinner is still alive.<br>  <br>  Sounds so horrible! - hope I have helped though?.|`|1f835a30228542e4408502a88775ab95aa	It comes from your dead flesh and stuff|`|38db473bba518929aa6f9e4e794fa8e3aa	flies lay eggs on the body. the eggs hatch into maggots|`|76012b31c36b2d5220ec455db988431aaa	Interesting you bring that up.  Before Louis Pasteur discovered the process of pasteurisation, people did indeed believe in a theory called "spontaneous generation", the belief that dead organisms transmorphed into simpler organisms like worms and maggots.  He disproved that through his discoveries, trying to make high bacteria dairy products last longer in limited refrigeration.  <br>  <br>  But maggots do appear in live bodies as well.  The scent and moisture of open exposed wounds invites flies to lay eggs, especially when there is little to sterilise a wound, such as the open desert, or in tropical regions.  The invalid elderly often develop bed sores, and sick animals may have maggots on their wounds or infected areas, yet they may still heal and live on depending on their defense systems.  <br>  <br>  The "flesh eating" virus is simply a hyperreaction of a body's underactive immune system to a simple wound where the streptococcal bacteria has found an environment that allows it to flourish.|`|8dedf73a5dc093b4154f8532636b4ed6aa	When there is a dead body,the Blowfly,usually shows up first,sometimes within 15 minutes of death to feed on decaying tissue.<br>  Females lay eggs-hundreds of them -in the body's natural orifices and in any wounds present.<br>  In each egg a maggot begins to form.Depending on temperature,it can take 8 to 10 hours for the eggs to hatch,maggots emerge.Eventually,the maggots practically take over.Maggots can consume 60% of a corpse in less than a week.<br>  Once they are done feeding,they move away from the body,bury<br>  into the ground and pupate,in that stage they develop crusty shells along the lines of a silk moth making a cocoon called <br>  puparia.After 10 to 20 days a fly is born.|`|c8661ff71bac5ddef0af0177c307fe75aa	maggots are the larvae of flies.<br>  <br>  Flies land on dead meat and lay their eggs.|`|818a1f2782a8ccb3de8ae3568c7fb663aa	The blue-green iridescent fly.

Die Spannungs?nderungen wiederum erm?glichen die Steuerung aller Prozesse, die auf Zellebene ablaufen.<br>  <br>  Auch das Nervensystem und seine Informationsübertragung basieren auf dem Austausch und der Konzentrations?nderung von Ionen zwischen Zellinnenraum (Intrazellul?rraum) und Extrazellul?rraum. Die Regulation des Wasserhaushalts funktioniert über Ionentransporte und ist mit dem Elektrolythaushalt eng verknüpft.<br>  <br>  Ein so immens wichtiger Teilbereich wie der Elektrolythaushalt wird daher auch von vielen Systemen überwacht und beeinflusst. Verschiedene Hormone, die vor allem im Gehirn, in der Schilddrüse und in der Nebenniere gebildet werden, regeln die Ionenkonzentration im Extrazellul?rraum und indirekt damit auch die Konzentration innerhalb der Zellen.<br>  <br>  Unterschiedliche Vorg?nge und Krankheiten nehmen Einfluss auf die Ionenkonzentration im K?rper. Hierzu z?hlen Schwitzen, Erbrechen, Durchfall und Nierenerkrankungen.<br>  <br>  Normalerweise gibt es im K?rper genauso viele Anionen wie Kationen, das hei?t, es besteht elektrische Neutralit?t. ?ndert sich auf irgendeine Weise die Elektrolytzusammensetzung, so verschieben sich die anderen Elektrolyte insofern, als die Konzentration der gesamten Anionen genauso gro? bleibt wie die Konzentration der gesamten Kationen.<br>  <br>  Die alte chemische Ma?einheit ist das Gramm?quivalent (mval/l):<br>  Molekulargewicht / Wertigkeit = val<br>  <br>  <br>  Die neue SI-Einheit gibt die molare Konzentration an (mmol/l). Da fast alle relevanten Kationen und Anionen einwertig sind, ist der Betrag der beiden Ma?einheiten fast immer gleich.|`|1725118e553d8b7372f0c591223f1186aa	@ Darling851:<br>  <br>  Wer nach dem Prinzip "Copy - Paste" vorgeht sollte doch wenigstens seine Quelle angeben...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.netdoktor.de/laborwerte/fakten/elektrolyte/elektrolyte.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdoktor.de/laborwerte/fakte...</a>|`|8594c2f53657f257662e12a69a2e0c85aa	eine reine erfindung, gibts nicht.|`|e665ecbdeb4c12e72e9118db62553912aa	Ein Elektrolyt ist ein Stoff, z.B.

I will leave it up to you to refresh yourself on either of those methods of dividing polynomials, but this one is fine for synthetic which is easier.  You put -1 in the "box" and 1 and 0 for your row of numbers representing the coefficients.  Your resulting row is 1 and -1, which represents the linear term and the remainder.  Hence 1 - 1/(x+1).

Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines. <br>  No. Intelligence involves mechanisms, and AI research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others.

The upper management is depending on middle, middle depending on entry, and it all comes down hill, but the numbers run uphill and by the time they get to the top, no one knows if they are right or wrong, as in hardly any organization does one person know the business from bottom to top and reverse anymore. I firmly believe most people only know their deparment and as the numbers are sent around, there isn't one person who can catch a mistake these days. We are so dependent on the "numbers" from the computers, no one knows if they are correct or not. Try calling a company and reaching someone, most people aren't even trained as to where to send you if you don't know yourself. I see this growing each time I try to take care of some business. From the doctor to the lawyer to the Indian Chief. It's so sad, as their are so many talented people out there working, putting all of themselves into a broken system. I do believe the problem started when we first went to computers and a few of the people believed you just put the information in and the computer spit out the correct information via reports. But no one is checking the data from department to department. My husband works for a National company and constantly comes home and tells me of thousands of dollars he has found in overpayments to companies that even the Controller in the corporate office doesn't find. He fights hard to get the money back, but the sad part is, no one is minding the store. He is only in one department of a very large company, so on the small scale he is working at, think of the thousands lost in the whole company. We both believe if people don't quit spending their time sending personal emails, spending days in meetings and don't get back to their work, learning the business from top to bottom, bottom to top, our corporate world will fall like the Roman Empire.

AGI is when the machine's 'intelligence' is equal to or greater than the intelligence of the people who built the machine.

Wasser hat seine typische Eigenschaft, denn:<br>  <br>  1) Es ist flüssig, weil es H2O im zweiten Aggregatzustand ist.<br>  <br>  2) Da es als Flüssigkeit leicht verschiebbare Moleküle hat, kann es andere Dinge, wenn sie por?s sind, nass machen. Es dringt in kleineren Mengen z.B. zwischen den F?den eines Gewebes ein und macht es nass.<br>  <br>  2) Vor manchen anderen Flüssigkeiten zeichnet es sich durch die F?higkeit der Adh?sion aus - Tropfen bleiben an der Haut h?ngen. Quecksilber dagegen würde nur abperlen.<br>  <br>  All dies sind typische Wasser-Eigenschaften, sie h?ngen mit den Eigenschaften seiner Moleküle zusammen. Und die Summe davon wird als "nass" definiert". So haben wir es von unseren Eltern gelernt. Es ist also eine Definitionsfrage, und die kann man schlecht hinterfragen, daher reagiert man auf die Frage, weshalb Wasser nass sei, verst?ndlicherweise eher unwillig. <br>  <br>  übrigens hat Wasser noch andere bemerkenswerte Eigenschaften. Normalerweise dehnen sich Stoffe je nach Temperatur linear aus bzw. schrumpfen zusammen, je k?lter es wird; nicht so das Wasser. Zwar schrumpft es, wenn es k?lter wird, aber schon bevor es gefriert, dehnt es sich wieder aus. Daher k?nnen Fische am Boden eines Sees überleben, obwohl sich über ihnen bereits eine Eisdecke bildet. Ohne diese Anomalie müsste der See vom Grund her zufrieren und die Fische würden schlie?lich ganz oben herumzappeln. Ich wei? von keiner anderen Flüssigkeit, die sich so verh?lt.|`|wncC3YAsaa	Du kannst fragen warum der Himmel blau ist weil es gibt auch andere Dinge die blau sind.<br>  <br>  Aber warum Wasser nass ist kannst du nicht fragen, weil das ist das einzige was nass ist.|`|sU1ZsL4eaa	Also ich finde tinky_winky_198 hat deine Frage schon perfekt beantwortet!

YyWhUkDYaa	I have heard of them....they have like a special core|`|bg86ji6naa	if you make them out of diamond|`|4fWZL4TRaa	The spacing and thickness of the bars makes it harder work. One method is to have a strong inner steel rod for each bar with an outer tube over it that is of hardened steel material, and rolls around the inner rod when you apply the hacksaw. Some grades of stainless steel are hard enough that a hacksaw cannot cut them readily. The roller has to be made so it is not easily jammed by a lump of wood levered against it. Close spacing again. A hacksaw is only one thing to defend against. Bolt cutters are another. Lots of thick bars, close together so the jaws won't fit through, hard materials. If they have an Oxyacetylene torch, or escalate to a thermal lance, well you can't guard against everything.<br>  <br>  A crowbar, or worse a chain tied to the bars with a truck pulling it could be used - making it stronger to resist this just leads to greater damage. One thing to consider is fire. If you have strong security it could be a fire trap. Consider that fire is much quicker than we think. Give yourself one minute, that's all.<br>  <br>  The door may be the weak spot, a jemmy or crow bar can easily break most wooden doors, steel is much more difficult, even a few strategic steel plates might help. The roof - just taking a few screws out etc.. Even brick walls succumb to a large hammer.<br>  <br>  The point is that security is a deterrent, particularly against opportunists, but a determined intruder can find a way. If someone is walking along the street, and your house is easier than the others, or has an obvious defect, it becomes a point of interest.<br>  <br>  Alarms, security guards, dogs. It seems to me that a suitable alarm system can detect any intruder reliably. If that then brings a guard in short time, problem solved. What I have seen in some places is a compound with a high security fence, spikes or razor wire etc. That is the first line of defence. That was not in Africa though, so the needs might be different. Sort of detracts from the idea of a dream home.<br>  <br>  Considering the cost of a house, and the cost of security measures, I would use a consultant - perhaps an architect etc. with local experience, to see what they think is a reasonable approach, or at least so you have a range of advice, and see what others are doing. You need to understand the local attitude. For example, if you do something too extreme, they see that as unfair, and harassment starts.

Além disto:<br>  <br>  O objeto é disparado abruptamente para cima, ou seja, ele sairá com uma velocidade enorme da arma...<br>  <br>  Maaaas, na hora da volta, ele parte da velocidade 0 (momento em que ele pára no ar) e vai adquirindo velocidade lentamente. <br>  <br>  Ele irá atingir a velocidade máxima, também chamada de velocidade terminal do projétil. Esta velocidade terminal fica em torno de 20 m/s, diferente dos 100 a 300 m/s de velocidade quando o objeto é disparado pela arma de fogo.<br>  <br>  Pior ainda vai ficar se parte da energia for gasta com rota??o, ou seja, o objeto come?ar a girar em torno do seu próprio eixo no ar. Esta instabilidade fará o projétil perder mais velocidade ainda. <br>  <br>  Se esta bala acertar alguém, vai dar no máximo, uma dorzinha de cabe?a.|`|8dbf0037d421fb9259d21a2a17cbbfb2aa	Creio que n?o pois a energia que a bala gastou para subir(vencer a gravidade) <br>  ela vai recuperar quando descer (com o auxílio da gravidade). <br>  Mas a resistência causada pelo ar é um elemento que ocorre tanto na descida quanto na subida e portanto desacelera a bala nos dois momentos.

Primeiramente n?o tem nada haver com velocidade. Toda bala possui uma ponta. A 1a fun??o da ponta eh perfurar um corpo. Essa ponta NUNCA será a primeira a tocar um corpo. Ou a bala tocara o corpo de lado ou do lado liso (sem a ponta). Por quê? Simples: A ponta é a parte mais leve. Numa queda livre, a parte mais pesada vai na frente. Por isso a bala nunca cairá de ponta e se n?o cai de ponta n?o vai conseguir perfurar um corpo, mesmo que tenha velocidade. <br>  <br>  A bala só vai cair de frente se for impulsionada como por exemplo por uma arma.|`|2nm7WjThaa	Se o tiro for reto, o projétil vai subir até determinada altura, após o que, durante alguma fra??o de segundo ele vai parar, a velocidade vai ser ZERO. Em seguida, sob a press?o atmosférica, o projetil vai cair e sua velocidade vai aumentando progressivamente de acordo com a distancia até atingir o alvo.<br>  <br>  Possivelmente, o estrago vai ser maior.|`|1Ogftn2Qaa	De jeito nenhum.

xPkTDJM5aa	La teoria dell'evoluzione è meravigliosa, e non credo abbia punti deboli. Anzi, più si approfondisce lo studio e si va avanti nella ricerca, più appare sensata e senza lacune. <br>  <br>  Condivido con te l'idea che spesso chi muove delle accuse alla teoria è ignorante in materia. il primo punto che hai segnalato è il rapporto filogenetico fra uomo e scimmia, e hai fatto notare una cosa assai intelligente. La specie Homo non deriva dallo scimpanzè, ma da antenati loro comuni. Io e lo scimpanzè siamo "cugini" più che "nonno-nipote", allo stesso modo i pesci non sono gli antenati degli Anfibi, i pesci moderni hanno seguito un cammino evolutivo indipendente da questi ultimi.<br>  <br>  Punto due: questione della comparsa della vita sulla terra. E' ampiamente dimostrato da decennni che in ambiente simile a quello primordiale gli atomi si dispongono a formare molecole organiche semplici come aminoacidi e nucleotidi Questi ultimi si dispongono in catene che hanno la capacità di autoreplicarsi. Da qua in poi la teoria dell'evoluzione non fa una piega. Prima la comparsa di queste molecole si giustifica con la chimica semplice, e la fisica. <br>  <br>  Cosa non spiega la teoria dell'evoluzione? mi spiace non rispondere alla tua domanda, ma io punti deboli non ne vedo. Se questa teoria fosse insegnata sul serio, e non come un margine dei corsi di biologia, tutti noi avremmo una mente più aperta e sapremmo guardare con più giudizio ciò che ci circonda. Darwin (e con lui tutti quelli che vi hanno contribuito) hanno donato all'umanità qualcosa di affascinante, se solo la gente se ne rendesse conto...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PS: per robyscottà= e perchè mai uomo e scimmia avrebbero dovuto seguire lo stesso cammino evolutivo? Colonizzare ambienti diversi significa andare incontro ad esigenze diverse, con la selezione naturale che non premia le stesse caratteristiche. Uno scimpanzè che vive nella foresta tropicale è perfettamente adattato al suo ambiente, perchè mai la selezione naturale avrebbe dovuto premiare in questa specia caratteristiche "più umane"?<br>  <br>  x robyscottà= tu parli di una mutazione che "fa parlare". Peccato che un processo complicato come quello di sviluppo di un apparato vocale adatto ad una fonazione complessa ed intelletivo come per un linguaggio sia un processo evolutivo di migliaia di anni. Perchè mai una scimmia che vive in un ambiente nel quale queste caratteristiche non servono avrebbe dovuto riprodursi più di altre e quindi avere fitness maggiore? ragazzi, non scherziamo con la teoria dell'evoluzione, conosciamola prima di criticarla.|`|D8SjkyCvaa	@robyscottà. Primo: anche la teoria della relatività si chiama teoria, ma non significa che non sia stata supportata da prove "certe", quindi eviterei conclusioni fuorvianti.<br>  Secondo: nelle scienze (ti sembrerà strano, ma è così) nessuna teoria è dimostrabile, ma solo supportabile da continui risultati sperimentali. Ma anche dopo migliaia di conferme ci potrebbe essere anche un solo esperimento che invalida la teoria (o meglio, la teoria restringerebbe il suo ambito di validità: l'esempio classico è quello della dinamica newtoniana, validissima a livello macroscopico e per velocità basse rispetto a quella della luce, ma non più valida agli estremi di velocità e dimensioni (in piccolo)).<br>  Terzo: se secondo te le scimmie non dovrebbero esistere perché si sarebbero tutte dovute evolvere nella specie umana, allora implicitamente dici (è una conseguenza logica della tua ipotesi) che nel mondo dovrebbe esistere un'unica specie animale al posto tutta la biodiversità, in quanto non ammetti ramificazioni. Cosa che ovviamente è falsa.<br>  <br>  Tornando alla domanda, se vogliamo trovare dei punti deboli alla teoria darwiniana, che è considerata una delle teorie più belle (e valide) esistenti, potrei dire che difetta un po' nell'aspetto matematico. Nel senso che è quasi impossibile fare previsioni precise secondo un modello matematico appunto (ma delle previsioni si possono cmq fare), mentre spesso (o sempre) in fisica le teorie vengono valutate proprio verificando la validità dei modelli previsionali: se è vera la teoria X, allora si deve verificare Y. Se Y non si verifica, e se non ho sbagliato niente, allora X è falsa.<br>  <br>  Ma c'è un motivo: solitamente la fisica opera su oggetti "semplici", come atomi, elettroni, pianeti, onde elettromagnetiche, e può permettersi di formulare modelli descrittivi matematici piuttosto accurati; mentre la biologia si occupa di oggetti molto ma molto più complessi: cellule, organismi, popolazioni, comunità, ecosistemi, e ciascuno di essi è composto da un' infinità di atomi e molecole.<br>  <br>  Ciononostante, esistono esempi di leggi matematiche applicate alla teoria darwiniana. Ad esempio in genetica di popolazioni c'è la legge di Hardy-Weinberg.|`|Gw0m0Rivaa	Forse l'unico punto debole per la teoria dell'evoluzione di Darwin è proprio l'uomo, egli ha spazzato via centinaia di specie molto più evolute per resistenza al freddo, dimensioni enormi, ghiandole velenifere, autorigenerazione del sistema nervoso centrale e lo ha fatto deliberatamente e con l'unico scopo di uccidere malvagiamente e stupidamente, guardiamo ad esempio i bisonti in America, fatti fuori al solo scopo di divertirsi nel cacciarli. Se Darwin avesse ragione e il pianeta è un'unica grande ricerca di adattamento alla sopravivvenza e all'evoluzione mi chiedo come mai un animale così stupido come l'uomo, sia stato lasciato libero di agire per qualche centinaio di anni e temo che la risposta faccia ulteriormente rabbrividire, perchè il pianeta ha dei tempi per reagire e noi, scimmie impazzite, abbiamo fatto tutto in un millesimo di secondo, facendo ammalare il sistema rigenerativo stesso del pianeta, bruciando gas, modificandone temperatura, produttività e capacità di recupero e temo inoltre che se l'uomo non andasse in controcorrente dall'attuale atteggiamento nei confronti del pianeta, presto il pianeta troverà un modo per fermarlo, con o senza l'aiuto degli altri esseri viventi. L'evoluzione della specie si fermerà quindi tra un batterio e un alga verde, dmostrando quindi che ne Darwin e ne il creazionismo avevano ragione.|`|HqLHVVRZaa	l'antenato comune era una scimmia, quindi l'uomo discende dalla scimmia.<br>  questa più che una controprova è un'affermazione che coinvolge così tanto i sentimenti umani da bastare per sbeffeggiare una teoria unificante e generale come quella di darwin.<br>  il darwinismo puro, così come formulato da charles, è stato tuttavia più volte criticato anche dai biologi evoluzionisti, soprattutto perché lui lo intendeva come centrato sulla popolazione anziché sull'individuo o sul gene (variante che sta prendendo campo negli ultimi decenni). inoltre non considerò che la pressione ambientale potesse variare, nè che questa potesse colpire il fenotipo (povero, non conosceva il dna!)<br>  si può discutere il darwinismo, ma non l'evoluzionismo...quello che resta è una verità universale e inconfutabile, già accennata da molti ma mai fino ad allora oggetto centrale di pubblicazioni scientifiche. <br>  il punto debole dell'evoluzionismo attualmente è come sia potuta iniziare la trascrizione del rna, ma questo non intacca la validità generale della teoria.<br>  dagli scettici sentirai critiche del tipo: gli equilibri della natura sono così perfetti che non possono venire che da una mente superiore. mi domando come si possa nel 2000 essere creazionisti, ma se vai in altre sezioni di answers trovi esempi del genere.|`|erwR5UPmaa	Io sono un sostenitore della teoria di Darwin, quindi non ho punti per mettere in difficoltà questa teoria.<br>  La fragatura è che gli scienziati non hanno ancora trovato l'anello mancante tra un ominide che si assomigliava alla scimmia e noi.<br>  Col tempo lo troveranno!<br>  Purtroppo ci sono molti ignoranti e non conoscono la teoria o credono che ci sia un solo passo evolutivo tra la scimmia e noi, non vedono l'evoluzione in scala millenaria!|`|uDuYbyOxaa	a dir la verità secondo me la seguente teoria non fa pieghe. senz'altro l'evoluzone è una cosa esistente e ke continuerà ad esistere|`|d6c8796efaaa359d5f26a20592e65f16aa	teoria dell'evoluzione di Darwin<br>  <br>  proprio perché viene detta ancora oggi "TEORIA" significa che non é suffragata da prove certe che possano far affermare che Darwin abbia enunciato una "LEGGE GENERALE" valida in modo universale.<br>  <br>  -

f1beDbKIaa	Exit pupil is easy to calculate.  It's the size of the aperture divided by the power.  So 7x35 binoculars, it's 35 mm / 7 = 5 mm. <br>  <br>  How big is the pupil of your eyes?  Well, during the day, they're quite small.  Perhaps 2 mm.  At night, when your eyes are adapted to the dark, they might be anywhere from 5 mm to 8 mm, depending on how dark it really is, and how old you are.  So how do you find out?  One way is to get a metric set of hex wrenches.  Go out on a clear moonless night as much as possible away from light pollution.  Find a star, and hold a small hex wrench in front of and horizontally across one eye.  I'd try 4 mm first.  Move it up and down a bit.  If your pupil has dilated to larger than 4 mm, you should see two images - one above and one below the hex wrench.  If you can see both, then move up to your next size.  When you can no longer see two images of the star, you're done.  That's your pupil size.<br>  <br>  What does it mean?  Well, if the exit pupil of your binoculars (or scope) is larger than your pupil, some of the light falls outside the pupil, and is not detected by your retina.  The image will be dimmer than it might otherwise be.  It's OK if the exit pupil of your binoculars are smaller.<br>  <br>  Let's say that you're on a boat at night.  You've measured your pupils, and they're 5 mm.  And you have 7x35 binoculars.  The exit pupil is 5 mm, just like your eyes.  Everything is great, right?  However, on a bouncing boat, it's tough to keep the full circle of the exit pupil registered exactly on your pupils.  It can be easier to keep 7x21 binoculars pointing at your eyes because the 3 mm exit pupil can wander around a bit and still be within your 5 mm pupils.<br>  <br>  So why should some people have 5 mm and others have 8 mm dark adapted pupils?  Mostly, it's age.  Really young people have smaller eyes - they're still growing.  By your late teens, they're adult sized.  But, you're still reasonably young, and they can dilate to their maximum, probably closer to 8 mm.  As you get older, they may only dilate out to 5 mm.  There's no formula, you have to measure them.<br>  <br>  But you still might choose an eyepiece for a telescope for low magnification that has an exit pupil bigger than your own pupil.  I can think of two reasons.  First, you may be an old guy with 5 mm pupils, and you want to show younger folk with larger pupils.  Second, you often go with low power for wide fields of view, rather than for maximum brightness.  And, the view may not be noticeably dimmer with a slightly too large exit pupil - and the extra field of view may be desirable.<br>  <br>  Astronomical binoculars often have higher power as well as larger aperture.  For example, Celestron 25x100 binoculars have a 4 mm exit pupil.  Vixen makes binoculars with replaceable eyepieces, meaning the exit pupil can be anything.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~category_id=binocular_astronomy/~pcategory=binoculars/~product_id=09119" rel="nofollow">http://www.telescope.com/control/product...</a><br>  <br>  Not to simply be contrary.  My 10 mm telescope eyepiece has 6.3 mm eye relief.  I like it.  In particular, it means my eye is close enough to the eyepiece to limit stray light from my surroundings.  And, my eyelashes can be used to gauge the distance easily so that i can hold my head steady.  I wear glasses, but not while observing.  While eye relief can be important from a comfort level, it's more at matter of personal preference than most people let on.|`|AA10880755	Exit pupil is less important than eye relief.  All binoculars have an exit pupil that is well within reasonable range (see more below).  A 10x50 binoculars have a 5 mm exit pupil which is just perfect.  A 7x50 will have a 7 mm exit pupil which is also very good.  You can calculate the exit pupil by dividing the aperture by the magnification.<br>  <br>  Now, about eye relief.  Around 20 mm is a comfortable eye relief.  Short eye relief (less then 13-15 mm) makes it hard for people with glasses to see the full field of view.  Less then 10 mm is uncomfortable for anybody (with or without glasses).  Very long eye relief (more than 25 mm) makes it difficult for some people to center the image and can introduce other artifacts such as "kidney bean" distortion.  You don't say which model you are planning to buy, but I am sure that their eye relief will be well within the comfortable range (most likely between 15 and 23 mm).<br>  <br>  Going back to exit pupil.  Too big exit pupil (more that 7 mm) means that some of the light will be "wasted" because it won't fit within your eye's pupil (which typically is 7 mm for young people, and decreases to about 5 mm  with age).  Too small exit pupil (less then 1 mm) amplifies the effect of the shadows that dead cells floating inside the eye project on the retina.  Young people don't have this problem, but it can be quite noticeable for people over 50.  But this is only relevant for telescope eyepieces - binocular exit pupils don't get even close to this lower limit.
f1beDbKIaa	For bird watching, i use 8x21 binoculars.  For astronomy, i use 8x21 binoculars, despite the availability of 8x42 and 10x50.<br>  <br>  For me, 8x21 binoculars have these features:  They fit in my pocket.  Especially in winter, when i've got one of those huge winter coats, 8x21 binoculars can be parked in a coat pocket, so i always have them.  They're light weight, so i can hold them longer.  I find that 8x is not so powerful that i can't hold them steady.  I find 10x to be very difficult to hand hold, and need a tripod (which i have).  YMMV.  For day time use, 8x and 21 mm is plenty of power and light.  And, i have a 22x60 spotting scope on a very sturdy tripod if i need more.  At night, i use my 8x21 binoculars to find objects that just aren't visible naked eye.  I have enough field of view to navigate, and i get two magnitudes of dimmer objects than naked eye, allowing me to see many more field stars.  And, when i want more light and power, i have a 240x254 monocular (10" telescope).<br>  <br>  If you're going to have a tripod, and i mean a really good sturdy tripod, then go with larger binoculars.<br>  <br>  But i went with really cheap binoculars this last time around.  $25 at a sporting goods store.  They're more fragile than expensive binoculars.  But if you treat them like glass artwork, they'll last decades.  Cheap binoculars may not have very good close focus.  That matters if you want to do butterfly watching.  I've never seen it as a problem for bird watching.  And for astronomy, close focus is, by definition, irrelevant.<br>  <br>  While i have binoculars and a spotting scope on a tripod, i find them quite awkward for astronomy.  In astronomy the best views are straight up, so you're looking through the least amount of atmosphere.  But straight through binoculars require that you get your head directly beneath the eyepiece for that.  So binoculars with a 45 degree or 90 degree bend are better.  If you can lie down on your back and hold them steady, straight through binoculars are fine.  And i use them that way when otherwise doing a meteor watch.|`|AA10259042	16 is too much magnification for hand held binoculars.  The image will jiggle like mad.  8 power is for many people the maximum that can be comfortably hand held.  10 power is also an option but some people think there is too much jiggle. I have both 8 and 10 power.  I quite honestly can not tell the magnification difference between the two.  The 8 power has a much wider field of view in general, but it does vary between models.  The wider field of view comes in very handy in nature views because you see more in the field so it is easier to find what you are looking for.  Although 50 mm will prove an advantage for dim sky objects, you will find that the extra weight will become burdensome after a while of holding them up.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	For astronomy, even 10x50 binoculars will be shaky.  If you can, get a pair of binoculars that can be mounted on a tripod (either with a threaded fitting or an optional mounting plate).  Depending on your budget, another option is a pair of image-stabilized binoculars.  The objective sizes are usually smaller (often 25-30 mm instead of 50 mm), so objects won't appear as bright, but many people find that the steadier image is more important than the loss of brightness.|`|AA10880755	10x50 is probably your best option.  16x50 are too shaky if you use them without a tripod.  Some people can handle 12x50, but I find 10x50 to be more versatile.  The small gain in magnification between 12x50 vs. 10x50 does not justify the loss of field of view and image stability.<br>  <br>  Actually, personally I prefer 7x50, but I have a couple of telescopes that I use for higher magnification views.<br>  <br>  Regardless of which binoculars you buy, Nikon is a good choice.  Just make sure that you buy waterproof (nitrogen filled) binoculars.

It helps to use the proper technique: put your hands on the objective end of the binicular, not on the main body (here the prisms are), and tuck your elbows into your chest, making a triangular support. I also use a chaise longue a lot while observing with binoculars. Its back adjusts to the right angle, and I can rest my elbows on the arm rests, again making for a solid support.<br>  <br>  My own 10x50s are Celestron Pro's (actually probably made by Vixen in Japan), now discontinued, very similar to Orion UltraViews:<br>  <a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/product/~category_id=binocular_standard/~pcategory=binoculars/~product_id=09351" rel="nofollow">http://www.telescope.com/control/product...</a><br>  <br>  Nikon products are generally excellent.

xopIi2Vfaa	I suggest you read a lot more about the issue before you write your essay. I don't think you have collected enough information yet. Use google and spend a few hours reading first before writing.. <br>  You first should establish what you mean by cloning. Humans have cloned plants for a long time. Did you know that the banana you eat comes from a clone? Whenever you take a part of a plant and get it to sprout roots and grow into a new plant you have performed cloning. <br>  Then you have to consider the advantages, disadvantages and ethical issues from cloning as nuclear transfer - the DNA of one cell is put into an egg cell. <br>  First read up how many embryos had to be generated for one sheep to be successfully cloned. Also read up on the further life and health of the first cloned sheep Dolly. Doing this should give you a lot of ideas what to discuss.<br>  <br>  And no, animals are not cloned because there are not enough animals. Breeding animals in the normal way is much, much cheaper and has a much higher success rate.|`|FD8I4zthaa	Cloned animals help with understanding how genetics works, and might help in curing diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimers and Parkinsons.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you want to make it illegal.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would write your persuasive essay the other way round. Try and persuade ignorant people why cloning is a good thing.|`|gf0tOrcpaa	No.  Cloning is really not that bad of a thing and I don't understand why you say it should be illegal?  Its unethical to clone animals just for eating Yes, but its not that it should be illegal.  Cloning on animals is not as bad of a process as you think, its not some mad scientist in a lab with a machine that takes in a sheep and two come out.  Its a natural thing, all we do as scientists is put sperm with egg and implant.  As for the genomics of this we may play around with genes at early stages (IE before fertilization) to make the sheep bigger, or more meaty (but this isn't cloning, it's called genetic engineering, so maybe you mean that that should be illegal?)  As for something going wrong with the animal I believe what you mean is early death.  As it stands right now we can't take the nucleus of a cell from a living sheep and make a baby sheep that lives the full life of a sheep.  This is because when you take the nucleus of a living thing it has a certain biological age.  It will pass this age from cell to cell.  When you start an organism at  a certain age, it already is older then normal.  So therefore it won't live as long.|`|23hPHjOqaa	No, so you have nothing to work with and secondly animals are not cloned for meat, cloning is a long and expensive process I hardly think farmers have the time and money for this.<br>  <br>  Cloning should not be illegal (within certain restraints such as mixing a cow and a dog together) however human organ cloning should be top priority at the moment.|`|5vFGO57Kaa	No

This would not have been nearly such a big deal if it hadn't been for the History Channel and its unconscionable programming decision to air that abysmal documentary -- not once, but several times.<br>  <br>  Nothing that has been rumored about some disaster or the end of the world in 2012 is true. There will be no galactic "alignment." The sun appears to cross the galactic equator on December 21, EVERY year and it does not, and will not, cross the galactic center. And even if it did, there would be absolutely no effect from it.<br>  <br>  The Mayans did not predict or imply the end of the world. And even if they did, so what? Various people or groups claiming some special insight have predicted the end of the world numerous times, just within my own lifetime and we're all still here. Some claim this was predicted by Nostradamus, the Bible, the Aztecs, the I Ching, etc., and every one of those claims is bogus. No, I don't just mean the predictions are wrong; I mean those people never even MADE any such predictions. Again, this is the result of liars and frauds who post things to the Internet or who manage to write a book or get their faces in front of a camera. Some television networks will air anything they think will get more viewers to see their commercials. It's all about making money from their sponsors.<br>  <br>  Other claims people make are equally bogus. There is NO planet Nibiru. The earth's magnetic poles will NOT flip in one particular day -- or year -- or century. That process takes thousands of years. And the earth's axial poles, don't EVER flip. People who talk about this Planet X are equally ill-informed and need to learn which sources of information are reliable. There is no such planet. That hypothesis was ruled out over a decade ago. If such a long term planet existed and it was due to be close to us in 2012, it would be inside the orbit of Saturn by now. Astronomers everywhere, even amateurs, would know about it. But there isn't a single one who claims the existence of this object. Again, this comes from people who post to the Internet without having a clue what they're talking about.<br>  <br>  There is NO computer program which can predict the end of the world and the creep who says he wrote such a program is also a liar and a fraud. And no, none of these claimed sources ever predicted 9-11 like their advocates say they did.<br>  <br>  There is no cyclical event which is due to recur in 2012, except for a solar maximum. These happen about every 11 years and there is no reason to believe this upcoming one will be any more harmful than any of the previous ones.<br>  <br>  This bunk is being pushed by unprincipled people looking for a profit, (like the History Channel), or out to scare kids or terrorize people back into church, (like St. Birgitta, on Youtube.)<br>  <br>  I can't imagine what kind of preparation there would be, but this isn't going to happen anyway.

3ZPYB7nxaa	//////////////////// here are the facts //////////////////////////<br>  <br>  Electromagnetism is the best understood of the 5 fundamental forces in physics. Faraday was the first to propose there were invisible lines of force influencing the motion of a compass needle around a wire carrying electricity. He then took these observations and created the world's first electric motor.<br>  <br>  Electric motors are one of the fundamental uses of electromagnetism. There are many motor designs, but they all have rotors surrounded by some sort of case which generates an electromagnetic field. Ordinary magnets illustrate how electric motors work. Opposite poles of each magnet attract one another, while the same poles repel one another. In an electric motor, magnetic fields are generated electrically. The rotor is drawn to a patch of magnetism in the case. Either the case and/or the rotor can generate magnetic fields by passing current through a coiled loop of wire. Opposite magnetic fields link the rotor and case, turning the rotor. The fields reverse direction and this pulls the rotor around and the twisting force generated is called torque. This design not only generates power, but the magnetic fields can generate electricity as well. If the rotor is turned by an outside force, electrical energy flows out of the motor instead of in to it. This device is called a dynamo and is where nearly all electricity is produced. The exception is solar electricity. The power source is most often a steam engine fired by burning coal. The engine is called a turbine and is linked to the rotor. Another source of power is running water. Hydroelectricity replaces the steam engine with a turbine driven by water flowing out the bottom of a dam.<br>  <br>  Faraday was the first to propose light itself was a form of electromagnetism. During most of his life, Faraday's ideas were met with conciderable skepticism, since scientists at the time found it hard to believe in things they could not see. Many decades later, Maxwell developed a set of mathematical equations which proved Faraday was correct, and most importantly were the tools needed to predict the amount of electrical power a magnetic field could generate. Just as there are static electrical fields, there are static magnetic fields. Again, magnets are examples of static fields. However, if the field changes in strength or direction, it produces electromagnetic waves. The amount of change is called flux. The electromagnetic spectrum is based on the wavelength of what this magnetic flux produces. The longest waves are known as radio waves. These waves of magnetic flux can set up a corresponding electrical flux in a loop of wire. This phenomenon is the basis of electronic "wireless" telecommunication. <br>  <br>  In the late 19th century, electricity was already being used to communicate. The American telegraph system used two electromagnetic devices directly connected by a pair of wires. The device consisted of a lever which the user could press to tap out a coded message. This code was known as Morse code and is still used today. The wires connecting the telegraph devices could be enormously long. There was a trans-atlantic cable, for example. <br>  <br>  The disadvantage of cable was that if it became disconnected, the signal was lost. "Wireless" communication solved this problem since radio waves were pure energy. However, the only signal which could be sent was the clicks of Morse code. Human voices were too complex for the first wireless devices. Then the original circuit was re-invented into a sophisticated filter called the superheterodyne receiver. This allowed voices, music and eventually motion picture signals to be broadcast.<br>  <br>  The telephone is another device which worked like the telegraph did. Its inventor found a reciever consisting of a pad of carbon granules allowed voice communication over a pair of wires. AT&T (Atlantic Telegraph and Telephone) was the industry which developed from this hard wired form of telecommunication. Modern telecommunication relies on radio waves and microwaves and is "wireless" or at least partially so. These waves are generated by electromagnetic induction however.<br>  <br>  ///////////////////////////<br>  <br>  Now, it's up to you to imagine what life would be without electric motors, telephones , telegraph , radio or television. Be aware of the fact that electromagnetically induced telecommunication is being rapidly replaced by digital communication. Digital signals are not the direct result of electromagnetism. However, they are converted into them at the end of the reciever (speakers and microphones are electromagnets).

This means that the rate of current flow through all devices is the same. The voltage across each device depends on its impedance/resistance of each device and the current flowing through the circuit. When adding more components in a series circuit, the current flow decreases, if the applied voltage remains constant. <br>  <br>  In a parallel circuit, each device is directly connected to the power source. This means that each device receives the same voltage. The amount of current flowing through each device is dependent on the impedance/resistance of that particular device. If devices are added to the power source in a parallel configuration, the current demand/flow from the power source increases.

Then you calculate Earth's orbital speed which now is 365 days approximately, then start counting backwards.  There maybe some variances due to the shifting of Earth's orbits as the planet was formed, but with the large number of years involved you can round a little bit and basically all you have to do is count backwards to that point and you will come to a figure of approximately 4.4 billion times + or - 500 million.

Les volcans crachaient sans cesse des gaz toxiques et de la vapeur d'eau.

Cent millions d'années de ce régime suffirent pour saler définitivement mers et océans. <br>  <br>  Mais si le salage de l'eau de mer est le résultat du ruissellement des pluies primordiales, alors pourquoi y a-t-il de l'eau douce ? <br>  J'étais s?r que vous alliez poser la question ! <br>  <br>  L'eau des lacs, fleuves et rivières contient tous les éléments qui pourraient la rendre salée.

Invece, dopo questi insuccessi colossali, spunta fuori l'esperimento 10.001, e come al solito milioni di persone ti cominceranno a dire che la profezia è vera e il mondo finirà.

La galassia come ogni altro corpo celeste compie delle rotazioni attorno al suo centro di gravità e quello della nostra galassia è un ciclo di 25.000 anni circa.<br>  I Maya non parlano da nessuna parte di fine del mondo, parlano di cambiamenti di ordine spirituale, cosa normale per qualsiasi popolo antico, superstizioso.|`|bc36b61d2d52736e5fc860ad6561ef54aa	P<br>  ..E<br>  ....R<br>  .I<br>  ..N<br>  ...E<br>  .....R<br>  .......Z<br>  ..........I<br>  ...........A|`|OxOxiCdIaa	io sinceramente nn vedo il motivo per cui dovrebbe finire...cioè in che modo finira la terra? con un asteroide o di colpo puff spariremo tutti???<br>  <br>  ho capito...questa è come la storia che nell'anno 1000 doveva arrivare la fine del mondo e nn è successo, o nel 2000 che i computer nn ricordo cosa doveva succerdergli e invece nemmono qui è successo nulla...<br>  è solo una credenza che pero ora sta finendo in una catastrofe inesistente...il mondo nn finira!|`|Film5JeHaa	fantasia pura|`|OYUjVt0Daa	Infatti i Maya non dissero che il mondo finirà, solo che entreremo in un nuovo anno galattico (mi pare) con conseguenti cambiamenti sociali. Io non sono un matematico ma, ti giuro, che ho un forte "sentire" che queste cose accadranno, nel senso che non ci saranno, forse, catastrofi ambientali, ma credo che la società cambierà diventando più "spirituale"!

Gli anziani Maya sono furibondi per questo; il mondo non finirà, sarà trasformato. Sono gli indigeni - non altri - a possedere i calendari ed a sapere come interpretarli correttamente<br>  All'alba del 21 dicembre 2012 - per la prima volta dopo 26.000 anni - il Sole nascente coinciderà con l'intersezione della Via Lattea e del piano dell'eclittica; questa intersezione cosmica viene considerata l'espressione del Sacro Albero, l'Albero della Vita - un albero presente in tutte le tradizioni spirituali del mondo. Alcuni osservatori sostengono che nel 2012 questo allineamento con il centro della galassia aprirà un canale che farà fluire energia cosmica attraverso la Terra, purificando il pianeta e tutti i suoi abitanti, portando tutto ad un più elevato livello di vibrazione. <br>  I poli sud e nord si stanno sfaldando, il livello delle acque oceaniche salirà ma, al contempo, lo faranno anche delle terre oceaniche, in particolare nella zona di Cuba. <br>   La data specificata dai calendari - il solstizio d'inverno dl 2012 - non indica la fine del mondo. Molti stranieri che si occupano dei calendari Maya fanno un gran baccano.<br>   L'umanità andrà avanti, ma in un modo diverso. Le strutture materiali cambieranno e da questo avremo l'opportunità di essere più umani.<br>  <br>  <br>  POI............NON FACCIAMOLA PESANTE!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .

In general in the animal kingdom, the females select which male they wish to mate with.  In some cases such as with deer and elk and some other mammal species, the males sort of fight it out to see which is top dog and then round up all the females and then begin passing on his genes. Birds are an interesting species. Generally if not exclusively the females pick which males they wish to mate with.  With some species of birds, the males all line up and do a dance, and the female picks the best dancer as with Prairie Chickens and Grouses. In other species of birds as in the Bower birds the males attempt to impress the females with their elaborate and colorful constructions.  In several others it is a territorial possession thing.  The males possess a territory and the females then pick the males with in their opinion the nicest territory. Instinct? Perhaps?  After all those species that did not have the instinct to mate are no longer with us.|`|L9Cx70gtaa	From watching my female cats, they do seem to have preferences, and mine seem to like polite male cats.<br>  I used to take in ferals and semi-strays.  I brought in a calico female and I thought.. I bet my Bubba-type cat (named Bushy for his fluffiness) will bug the hell out of her.  I introduced them and she hissed and ran him off. Surprised me.  Yet there was a timid stray cat that she would practically sing to while he sat across from our parking lot.<br>  My current cat would hiss at the black cat here, but there's a neighbor's cat that she kind of likes. He'll come to the door and meow for her.  It's cute.<br>  It's kind of interesting how animals can actually have a form of etiquette amongst themselves with sharing, non-aggression, etc.  There was a series on orangutans, Orangutan Island, that showed the same thing.. a sort of structured culture within the colony.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	They pick the strongest, healthiest mate to ensure that their offspring have the best chance of survival.<br>  <br>  It is just instinct, but it's also a way of determining who's best to breed with i.e who will produce the strongest offspring in terms of genes which may present them with an advantage.

6erm3Iagaa	On been possible, it will be a new challenge more than landing on the Moon because you have to take in account the atmosphere (11 km high) and meteorology events in Mars. This is something I'm working on to see if we can pull it off, but it will be expensive to pull off a rescue mission to Mars. The gravity pull of Mars is 3.71 Newtons in contrast of 9.8 Newtons on Earth. The escape velocity of Mars is:<br>  <br>  v = √[ (2GM) / r ]<br>  v = escape velocity<br>  G = gravitational constant<br>  M = mass of the planet<br>  r = radius of the planet<br>  <br>  By using this formula, the escape velocity of Mars is about 5.02 km/s or 11,226.7 mph. In order to to shorten the time span to Mars, it will be best to launch when Mars is close to the Earth. We will need to construct the rocket to go to Mars on Earth's orbit or on the Moon because to get off Earth and into orbit, a 2 stage rocket is required. The rocket can be constructed in stages on the ISS, if possible. This is the part where it is going to be expensive for the US to achieve such a program unless it cooperates with other nations.<br>  <br>  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br>  <br>  The mean distance from Mars to the Earth is about 78,000,000 km, but if the Moon is align with Mars, the mean distance will be 77,616,000 km. It will be best to launch the rocket on the Moon when its align with Mars making the trip more shorter. So if the rocket goes at Mach 20 (20 times speed of sound) then:<br>  t = d / v<br>  t = time<br>  d = distance<br>  v = velocity<br>  <br>  d = 77,616,000 km<br>  v = 20(330 m/s)<br>  <br>  t =  77,616,000,000 m / [20(330 m/s)]<br>  t = 11,760,000 seconds<br>  t = 136.11 days<br>  <br>  The engines the rocket is going to use to get to Mars, are the new engines been developed for the Ares V which will produce about 3.1 MN of thrust more than one SSME. That will accelerate the rocket to a trajectory towards Mars in less time. The engines will be used in burst to conserve fuel until reaching Mars where the rocket will be jettison. The second stage of the rocket will a space station similar to Salyut 4 with two engines in order to achieve escape velocity when coming back to Earth. <br>  <br>  Descending to Mars surface is another challenge in the mission to Mars. Unlike the Moon were you only needed a small craft to land and ascend back to the CSM with engines that delivered less than 100 kN of thrust, landing on Mars will require a 2 stage rocket to asend back to the orbiter. The lander will have to be equipped with a heat shield for entry into Mars atmosphere with parachutes to soften the lander's landing. The lander will be composed of 2 stages; the first stage will propel the crew were the second stage will then propel the crew into an orbit to roevouze with the orbiter. The orbiter will then fire its two engines to achieve an escape velocity to come back to Earth or back to the Moon. The engines will also be used in bursts to conserve fuel and still accelerate the ship. When the ship gets close to Earth, it will fire it engines once more to obtain orbital velocity. The plan is to dock with the ISS and then use a re-entry vehicle to get back to Earth. This will make parts of the project reusable saving millions or billions of dollars. <br>  <br>  The fuel for the first stage of the rocket to send the astronauts towards Mars will use Liquid Hydrogen with Liquid Oxygen. The rest of the rocket will be fueled by Nitrogen Tetroxide & Aerozine 50, propellants used for space probes. It would of make more sense if I could draw out the plan in further detail, but unfortunately I can't. This is something that US will have to cooperate with other nations, just like the ISS to achive this new goal.<br>  <br>  Note: I'm still missing factores for this strategy to work.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	How about to woman a mission to Mars also?|`|BGOPARrTaa	that would be unbeleiveable! if someone goes there.. it would cost a lot of money and also it prob. will take them 3 years to get there!! i really want to go and see our whole universe but 3 years man thats really long!|`|nYirFGvqaa	In theory, it is very possible to man a mission to mars although it would cost an unbelievable amount of money to fund such a mission. The biggest problem wouldnt be getting there, as much as it would be getting back. The closest Earth ever gets to Mars, is 100 million Km....so it would take a long time to get there, considering during apollo missions, it took 2 days for astronauts to travel to the moon, which is only 250000 miles away.  Seems like the most realistic idea, is to plan some sort of 1 man, 1 way mission....he(she)who goes, never returns type deal. This may take a toll on humans...with the lack of gravity, human encounter, etc. <br>  <br>  We probably wont see any such mission in our lifetime...but it sure would be great.|`|p5F2LtmNaa	It is very possible.

mrVgl6HDaa	Beh, se sapessimo ripsondere anche a una sola di queste domande saremmo un passo avanti! Alla faccia del "mettiamo in chiaro le cose"...<br>  <br>  Che io sappia non c'è nessuna teoria che spieghi la nascita dell' universo, intendo dire, ciò che vi è stato prima del big bang. Si ipotizza solo che inizialmente le quattro energie fondamentali (energia nucleare forte e debole, energia elettro-magnetica mi pare) fossero raggruppate in un'unica energia unita...ma non si sa da che cosa si sia formata ne come si sia espansa.<br>  <br>  Potremmo essere la cellula di un organismo superiore e così via dall' infinitesimamente grande all'infinitesimante piccolo...Di sicuro, se così fosse, vuol dire che l' universo come lo intendiamo è un subcomponente di ciò che compone gli atomi. Se così fosse, sarebbe plausibile che dentro ogni nostro atomo ci siano svariati universi...<br>  <br>  IL multiverso? Il multiverso presupporrebbe la presenza di un universo per ogni variabile possibile di ciò che esiste. Un universo per il mondo con 7.345.567 abitanti, uno per il mondo con 7.345.568, ogni universo per ogni disposizione atomica differente. Non è impossibile che ci sia ma una teoria dei viaggi nel tempo lo utilizza per spiegare la possiblità di viaggiare nel passato..ma come farebbe a crearsi nuova materia se noi modificassimo il passato? Se modifichiamo il passato, cambiamo lo status delle cose, e si forma un universo con i cambiamenti da noi apportati...ma la materia non si crea dal nulla, quindi o non è possibile il viaggio nel passato, o non è possibile il viaggio nel tempo.<br>  <br>  Secondo me, nemmeno l'eterno ritorno spiega il tutto..anzi, a me non risolve molti dubbi. <br>  <br>  Beh, la vita esiste e noi esistiamo, i pianeti e le galassie esistono. Non è un' illusione, perchè se pensiamo siamo...Se dal nulla non sicrea nulla allora, vuol dire che c'è sempre stato qualcosa, o che non è vero che dal nulla non si crea nulla.<br>  <br>  Credo che sia impossible immaginare che un qualcosa inglobi l'universo. Se immaginiamo questo, ci verrà da chiedere..ma allora, c'è qualcosa che ingloba quel qualcosa che ingloba l' universo? Forse c'è e c'è per infiniti strati, o forse l' universo è infinito e non ha bisogno di essere inglobato.<br>  <br>  Rimane la figura di Dio, che tu non hai citato, ma l'ha fatto un'altro utente. L' unico posto che, una persona informata di fatti e prove scientifiche, può riservare a un ipotetico Dio, è quello che sta prima del big bang (chiamalo poco!!). L'esitenza di ciò che viene dopo è parzialmente spiegata ( i dubbi sono tanti, ma i fatti sono di più), ma prima del big bang nulla è spiegato. Forse è li che risiede un Dio? Io personalmente non ci credo, ma non lo posso nemmeno escludere...forse Dio è un principio primo sempre esistito, o forse è quel nulla da cui qualcosa ha potuto formarsi...affascinante pensare che Dio non esiste, ma ha fatto esistere tutto.|`|MzoMAIKJaa	chi lo sa... e ql che c'è è solo teoria niente di pratico|`|6q7zMjWVaa	<a href="http://www.tabaccheria21.net/UNIVERSO.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.tabaccheria21.net/UNIVERSO.HT...</a>|`|ZOTRanZWaa	Quando le mettete poi in chiaro fatemi un fischio, che cosi' me le spiegate.<br>  <br>  Grazie.|`|cXRzO28Raa	Una volta ad una trasmissione televisiva ho sentito la celebre astrofisica Margherita Hack dire: "Per quanto ne sappiamo noi oggi è possibile che la materia sia sempre esistita, e che nessuno l'abbia creata".|`|e5554ee972a9e70ca446d90d601225ceaa	Ci sono un sacco di teorie.

The bag has a very low mass and high drag factor, which means it will be slowed down by the remaining atmosphere up there very quickly.

The term refers to the amount of energy required to change something from the liquid state to the gaseous state.<br>  <br>  For example.  It takes 1 calorie to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Centigrade.  It takes 16 calories to change 1 gram of water at 100 degrees Centigrade to steam at 100 degrees Centigrade.<br>  <br>  When evaporation of water occurs, it still requires 16 calories per gram to make the state change so it takes the heat out of the surrounding environment.|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	water requires a certain amount of energy to break the hydrogen bonds in it's liquid state, because the energy is transferred to the water from our bodies or the surrounding environment, we experience a cooling effect from say...sweating.

Personally as a physicist and a scientist, I can tell you that every 15,000 years the earth changes it's spin axis 120 degrees off present equator rotated from a point in Minsk,Russia...and the earth's core speeds up once again for a new cycle after passing through the VanAllen belt.

It has one of the longest liquid ranges of any metal and has a low vapour pressure even at high temperatures.<br>  <br>  Ultra-pure gallium has a beautiful, silvery appearance, and the solid metal exhibits a conchoidal fracture similar to glass. The metal expands on solidifying; therefore, it should not be stored in glass or metal containers, as they may break as the metal solidifies.<br>  <br>  High-purity gallium is attacked only slowly by mineral acids. Gallium arsenide is capable of converting electricity directly into coherent light and gallium arsenide is a key component of LEDs (light emitting diodes). In the 1990s gallium nitride (GaN) was discovered to emit blue light in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). As red and green LEDs were already known, this meant that red green, and blue LEDS could be used in full-colour LED displays while white LEDs and blue laser devices became possible as well.<br>  <br>  gallium is normally a byproduct of the manufacture of aluminium. The purification of bauxite by the Bayer process results in concentration of gallium in the alkaline solutions from an aluminium:gallum ratio from 5000 to 300. Electrolysis using a mercury electrode gives a further concentration and further electrolysis using a stainless steel cathode of the resulting sodium gallate affords liquid gallium metal.<br>  <br>  Very pure gallium requires a number of further processes ending with zone refining to make very pure gallium metal.<br>  <br>  see Gallium picture in<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webelements.com/_media/elements/element_pictures/Ga.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.webelements.com/_media/elemen...</a>

82NcoV7Saa	The food source of animals in high waters, comes from the sun. It gives energy to photosynthetic lifeforms (Plants and anything that can make food from sunlight) These autotrophs give food to heterotrophs (animals that eat other life forms, like cows eating grass, or a fox eating a rabbit) The energy from the sun trickles out. Here however, the sun is not there, so they rely on a much different food source.<br>  <br>  Here, there are heat vents, leading to undersea volcanoes. Certain organisms can break down the materials from these vents to make food. From there, life can just trickle up.<br>  <br>  Another way is that animals in those waters eat the remains of other organisms in the water that float down into their area. A whale, when it dies, leaves a cycle of life for the animals that decompose and eat the whales remains.<br>  <br>  That's about it, except for those animals in the dark sections of waters who just eat the animals in higher waters and return to their dark abyss afterwards.|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	These are chemotrophs or at least their nutrient system is structured that way.

k5Ece8BTaa	The Big Bang theory was initially one of many theories of the origin of the universe but upon the discovery of the background radiation permeating all of space it was realized the universe used to be very hot... and due to the conservation of energy that means all the matter in the universe must have been very close and has expanded outward ever since. Thus the Big Bang theory became mainstream and provided one of the most prolific examples of a a scientific theory being proven through observation.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, the Big Bang theory states that 13.7 billion years ago the universe was a super dense super uniform cloud of energy. At this time all the forces we know today (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong force, weak force) were one unified "super force". For some unknown reason space began to expand thinning the super dense cloud. This wasn't an explosion because the matter wasn't flying apart... it was the space in between matter getting bigger and increasing distances between individual particles. Over time, for another unknown reason, the once uniform universe became clumpy producing galaxies.<br>  <br>  And a lot of people say the Big Bang was the beginning of everything but in reality we don't know what came before it. I have a good analogy to why we don't know what it was like before the Big Bang:<br>  <br>  Imagine the universe is a sheet of origami paper in the shape of a crane. If I unfold and refold the paper into a turtle a smart observant person would be able to tell it was once in the shape of a crane by the fold marks on the side. This is just like how humans know what the past was like by observing the evidence (the folds) around us. However, if I unfolded the paper, ripped it up, burnt it, reconstituted the pieces into another sheet, and then folded it into another shape no one no matter how observant would be able to tell what the paper had originally looked like. This is like the Big Bang. It was such an extreme event we have no clues to what the universe was like prior to it and scientists never jumping to ANY assumptions admit there is a possibility nothing came before the Big Bang.|`|AA11564934	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang</a>|`|PMAkQPotaa	.It is theory that suggests the origin of the Cosmos.<br>  The Big Bang theory predicts that the universe came out of a very known explosion or eruption of energy of whose particles got separated from each other due to explosion and formed the stars ,planets,nebulae,etc .<br>  This theory also suggests that the universe is continuously expanding which was proved true by Edwin Hubble.|`|ldl8y9i2aa	We know the universe is expanding.<br>  If you run it backward in time, it would be contracting.<br>  Going back 13.7 billion years it would contract to a point volume.<br>  Now play it forward and you have the big bang.<br>  <br>  The point volume exploded - big bang - and the universe is still expanding.|`|uaYDfH2Qaa	It is a bunch of hogwash that so called "scientists" have dreamed up because they refuse to believe in the fact that God created all things - including the scientists !!!|`|p5F2LtmNaa	An excuse to try and deny the fact that there is a creator.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Q: Why do plants contain alkaloids? Is it merely to prevent fungi and bacterial infection? <br>  <br>  A: This is one of the greatest mysteries in biology. Nobody knows why plants contain alkaloids. There are many theories though. One is that alkaloids are defense mechanisms. They make plants taste bad or have poisonous effects, which may keep animals from eating them. They may help kill bacteria. Other possibilities are that alkaloids may actually encourage animals to eat certain parts of the plant, to help spread seeds - for example the opium poppy produces its alkaloids primarily in the seed pods. <br>  <br>  Nobody has found any internal use of alkaloids by plants, but this doesn't mean that they don't serve a purpose in the plant's metabolism or other life processes - it just means we don't know of any such purposes. In all likelihood, whatever caused their initial evolution, alkaloids probably now serve different purposes in different plants. For now, however, nobody really knows what alkaloids do or why they exist. Let's just be glad that they do!

z7BiMSWmaa	Onions go through a process called `bulbing' to produce the onion bulb. Bulbing is affected by amount of daylight, not by plant age. Daylight necessary to initiate bulbing depends on the variety of onion and can range from 12 hours for early maturing types to 15 hours for late maturing types. Mature onion bulb size is highly correlated to the size of the onion plant at the time bulb formation begins. Thus, bulb size is influenced by the same factors which influenced plant growth prior to the beginning of bulbing, plus environmental conditions during the completion of bulbing and maturity. Factors affecting large bulb formation include early planting, space per plant, soil moisture, weed competition early in the growing season, and damage from blowing soil particles, insects and pests.

Each Voyager carries a gold-plated audio-visual disc in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by intelligent aliens.

1Vgg8aL8aa	This is another example of Newton's 3rd law.<br>  When A exerts a force on B, then B exerts an equal (but opposite) force on A. <br>  ie equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.<br>  <br>  Examples.<br>  1. I poke you in the eye with a force of 7N. Your eye pushes back on my finger ....  also with 7N.<br>  <br>  2. The earth pulls down on my body with a force of 800N (we call this my weight of course). My body pulls on the earth, upwards from my point of view, with a force of 800N. Remember up and down are not really relevant. Gravitational attraction is a mutual force between any two objects. The direction is along the line joining their centres of mass.<br>  <br>  3.My motor-cycle wheel exerts a force on the road/earth. The roar/earth exerts an equal but opposite force on my wheel..... propelling me forward.<br>  <br>  4. There are millions of examples.... in factevery time a force acts, there inevitably must be an equal and opposite force SOMEWHERE on ANOTHER OBJECT.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question...... well you now know the answer I hope.<br>  <br>  Remember Force is a vector.so your answer needs magnitude (size) and direction.

RxiBpUUuaa	OK, so first thing is to understand traits. Words used in science have distinct definitions. According to my research, all humanity is one genus and species. That explains how we can breed or produce offspring with people of geographically distinct origins. Not as close as siblings, yet closely related. <br>  Traits in common shared by legally unrelated people are many and varied; blue eyes, or  ear lobe shape, for examples. <br>  Why is this? Apparently due to the short time we humans have differentiated generationally. There could be many observable similarities in people that are legally unrelated. While individual hair colors and textures are really unique, plenty are similar enough to be nearly identical.

Believe it or not, we aren't really looking.  There is simply too much sky to survey to find all the "dangerous" (near-earth) asteroids/objects.  We think we've found a good deal of the largest ones (since they're the brightest), but not even close to finding the small-medium sized ones (like the one that nearly hit Earth yesterday).  However, those asteroids would only destroy a city and nothing more (if they made a direct hit).  <br>  <br>  It sometimes bothers people that we aren't looking.  Most asteroids are found "serendipitously", meaning we were looking at some distant object and the asteroid went zooming through our field of view.  After movies like "Deep Impact" and "Armegeaddon", this is strange for people to hear, but it's just not feasible to search the entire sky with the current equipment.  All current telescopes and instruments are/were designed to study distant objects, which subtend relatively small fields.  A large telescope with an enormous field-of-view, simply doesn't exist.  It's not that we can't build it (there are plans for a telescope called Large Synoptic Survey Telescope LSST) but it's still a long way off.  The financial support from the gov't is just not there to  fund projects like all-sky surveys with multiple passes to identify moving targets.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	The number is not really known.

AA11513203	I think your analysis is sound.  You are correct to separate the physical sensation from the cultural associations, but there are a couple of steps you miss.   Lets break it down.<br>  <br>  First, we start out by assuming that all human beings have the same visual *equipment* ... and we verify this using straight category experiments.   You and I can't really compare our *physical* sensation of "blue" ... but we can both point to a bunch of things that we normally put in the category "blue" and find that we agree.   So all that tells us is that our visual system is close enough that we can learn what the word "blue" means.   We can meet a person from Spain who applies the word "azul" to the same objects ... and so we recognize that "azul" is just the Spanish word for "blue" so our color categories are not affected by the name we give to that category.<br>  <br>  So far so good.<br>  <br>  But pretty early in our lives we start to develop additional *emotional* associations with different colors.   Some colors or *combinations* of colors make us feel calm, others alarmed, others may remind us of mom's apron, or others remind of us that scary picture we saw on a wall on the way to school one morning.   We may not be aware of those associations, but they're there.<br>  <br>  And beyond that, there are (as you say) *cultural* associations that different cultures have to certain colors or color combinations.   In western cultures, white is the color of purity, while in some asian colors red is.   So that will also affect the *emotional* associations you attach to those colors.<br>  <br>  So by the time we're talking about an adult ... it's really hard to separate the *physical* sensation with the *emotional* and *cultural* associations we have learned to attach to those sensations.   <br>  <br>  It is difficult to imagine an experiment where we take my "consciousness" and transplant it into your brain to see if I experience the same sensations.   Consciousness is the result of the particular configuration of brain cells, the associations (this color combination triggers the association with mom's apron in that part of the memory centers) that are hard-wired.    There is no place where "perception" ends and "consciousness" begins.  <br>  <br>  And that's the bottom line of why these thought experiments are so useful and interesting.   They remind us that, even though we use words like "perception" and "consciousness" as if they are separate things ... they are not *really* separate.   They are intertwined ... and define who we are.|`|RNNsvSh9aa	I agree with you to some degree. We might never know how the world looks like in another persons mind and it could well be that different brains have "mapped" colours in different ways.<br>  <br>  But<br>  1) I hope you are aware that your "idea" is not a theory in the strict scientific sense of the word. Lets not confuse the poor creationists OK? ;)<br>  <br>  2) Your "idea" doesnt make the case of “one person perceiving a colour differently to another person”. It just states that there is this faint possibility that this "could" be.<br>  Therefore Im afraid its nothing more than a thought experiment (yet an interesting one).|`|MUWy20NVaa	Sight actually happens in the brain.  It is quite possible that two people may 'see' blue differently.  For instance, when you take a photo under fluorescent lights, the colors in the photo look funny even though the scene looked normal to your eye.  This is because your brain has a built-in color balancing circuit.  if the brain can adjust color perception, then it's quite possible that people all perceive the color that they have been taught to call 'Blue' differently.<br>  <br>  I've always thought it was interesting that the Japanese have no general word for the color range we call 'green.'  They have one word,(aoui) which covers blue and green, and another word (midori) for a particular shade of green.  One wonders if this is merely a linguistic curiosity or indicates an underlying difference in perception?
WkWedRnoaa	Since the Sun does not "move" relative to the rest of the solar system, sunrises and sunsets are created by either the movement of the Earth or the movement of astronauts around the earth while in orbit.  An astronaut could see the sun "rise" and "set" in a 90 minute cycle.<br>  <br>  But for those of us, less fortunate, with feet on the ground of good ole Mother Earth, we have to wait for the rotation of the Earth on its axis to generate our sunrises and sunsets.  There, you may have a way of saying that you've seen "two" sunsets in "one" day.<br>  <br>  After the summer solstice in June (northern hemisphere) or in December (southern hemisphere) the days begin to get shorter and the amount of daylight less.  This continues until the winter solstices when days begin to get longer.  While the days are shortening, sunsets (and sunrises) begin to take LESS than 24 hours to happen.  For instance, in November, where I live, sunset occurred at 5:13pm.  Each day afterward, for the next week, the sun set about a minute earlier or 23 hours and 59 minutes later.  Technically, that could be considered two sunsets in one "day" of 24 hours, but on the non-technical side, you'll never see the sun set at 10am, rise at noon, then set again at 5pm.  That would require some motion in the Earth that will never happen naturally.|`|OGw6Upv8aa	by definition, no.|`|f3399027b56ee13ae52644ed29eca245aa	The sun sets many times in a day, at different locations.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	You can't actually see the Sun set, rise and set again all in a few minutes, unless at some point in that time interval you are traveling around the Earth very fast towards the west. There has never been recorded any such thing as a 'phenomenon that caused the Earth's orbit to reverse'; not only would it have practically no effect on the setting Sun (because the day's length is determined almost entirely by the Earth's rotation period, not its orbital period), but the energy of such an event would easily have completely destroyed human civilization and probably blown at least several kilometers of the Earth's crust off into space. If the radio channels you listen to actually feed you this kind of bullcrap, then it's time you stopped listening to them.|`|4RJKl1aKaa	It can happen in the polar regions.  The reference is for sunrise and sunset at McMurdo Sound, Antartica.  On Feb 24 this year you will see that sunset was at both 12:05 AM and 11:52 PM.

You have to separate t^2*e^-t into two separate functions. set t^2=f and e^-t=g ' . Then the integral of v(t)=f*g-?(f ' *g)dt. (I use ? as the integral symbol, sorry for the confusion).

30XHbV35aa	Specific discharge q = ki from Darcy's law. i = hydraulic gradient which you will need to convert in to ft/ft or m/m. Who uses feet per kilometre? Your specific discharge will then be in the same units as your hydraulic conductivity (Darcy permeability) i.e. usually in m/s of ft/s. You don't specify the units for k: is this a hydraulic conductivity units of (length / time) or an intrinsic permeability (units of length)? If the latter, you'll need to convert to a hydraulic conductivity.<br>  <br>  n_e would then be used to get the pore fluid velocity v_f = v/n_e, which accounts for the fact that water flows through the effective pore space only.

But actually the calendar is a circle and starts back over when it ends. This is because they were measuring astronomical cycles.

The surgical tubing pulls in the plugs into the pipe ends sealing the pipe and trapping a quantity of water inside.|`|ii0hMr0caa	Try the KISS method, a weighted rope with containers attached at every fathom? Fix a one way valve that lets water in but not out so when you pull the rope back up, the sample remains trapped in the containers. Old water bottles would be good for this. You know from which depth the sample has been collected by it's position on the rope. Keep It Simple S.

4c2daec05f4f88483fd1490ee194945aaa	The part of this dream that's very real and practical (but still very expensive) with today's technology is called virtual reality.  Even without holographic projection, high quality, realistic, real-time rendering of images based on your position and perspective do a very good job of making you feel like you are really there.  You can get a small scale sample of this by using Google Earth to explore the Grand Canyon, flying through it as if in a helicopter.<br>  <br>  It need not be based on reality.  You could as easily 'fly' through simulated molecules, and observe how things might change if the electric force were slightly stronger or weaker than it actually is.  Immersive video games take this concept to the extreme.
ii0hMr0caa	In the UK we are now working with the I.E.E. Regs 17th edition. BS 3871 MC B's now just called CB's are the older type and may no longer be recognized in the operating characteristic graphs in the Regs or in the tables showing maximum values of earth fault loop impedance (Zs). This means that when designing a circuit you cannot predict the correct operation of the device, you can't say how quickly it will clear a fault under specified conditions.<br>  BS EN (British Standard European Norm) 60898 are the currently available types and in most cases will directly replace 3871 types (subject to re design calculations for the circuit) All data required will be found in the 17th edition or in manufacturers data sheets.
AA12329845	Females are born with a finite number of primordial follicles (Hirshfield, 1997). Some of these follicles mature to the antral stage and release eggs for fertilization during the reproductive years. The majority of the follicles (greater than 99%), however, undergo atresia (Byskov, 1978). The process of ovarian atresia is an apoptotic process that is regulated by highly conserved factors, including members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins (Choi et al., 2004; Gosden and Spears, 1997; Hsu and Hsueh, 2000). Two important family members that regulate ovarian atresia are Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic factor, and Bax, a pro-apoptotic factor (Choi et al., 2004; Flaws et al., 2001; Gosden and Spears, 1997; Hsu et al., 1996; Hsu and Hsueh, 2000). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/88/1/213" rel="nofollow">http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/con...</a>|`|CYtMRC4eaa	If you are referring to FOLLICULAR atresia, it is the breakdown and reabsorption of immature follicules in the ovary.

mH1Tnv5Naa	The technical answer would be D, as the air there is less dense, thus there are fewer gas molecules for a given volume as opposed to sea level.|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	There are actually several reasons.  B is correct, the air is thinner up there.<br>  <br>  But the column of air above the mountain top is shorter than above sea level.  That means there is simply more air mass in the column of air above sea level than above the top.  This results because the mass varies with the height of the column.  And as W = mg, more mass in the column means more air weight W and therefore W/A = P more pressure on an area A.<br>  <br>  You should be aware that saying the air is "thinner" meaning less dense is the same as saying "fewer gas molecules."  My point is that B and D are the same answer, but using different words.<br>  <br>  This was not a well thought out question.

There are only about a dozen zoos outside of china which are allowed to keep pandas, at the cost of $1 million a year to do so. <br>  <br>  In every way, keeping a panda at home is not an option.
