Do2zfA8daa	there's lots of things you can do. but really, it will take time to see changes if youre doing it right. first of all, make sure youre eating healthy and your body itself is healthy. intake lots of protein. get enough sleep every night. then work out your lower body. you should work out your calves alot. if your calves are strong then you will be faster and you will be able to jump higher. do multiple sprints like running across a basketball court back and fourth several times at a steady jog. then do the same thing except sprint as fast as you can. then go back to a jog and so on. but remember to strech before and after doing a workout. that is the most important thing|`|yzbG8823aa	Figure out how to work out your thigh flexors. These are the main muscles for running since it lifts your legs up and the faster you lift your legs up, the faster you run. Working out your quads is also a good idea. And if you can concentrate on creating fast twitch mucles. A good sprinter usually has 70 percent fast twitch and 30 percent slow twitch muscles. For upcoming competitions, slow down your work out routine a week prior to the competition and you'll notice a big difference.

600005cfc0fe06122483a58ce26e360faa	Main points. You must stay parallel with your opponent (ignored by most players). And the away team has to put their stick down first.|`|C1aFhbUMaa	Cheeks has it pretty well covered but I would add if in the opinion of the zebra with the puck you are trying to get an illegal edge he can bannish you from the circle for this drop and someone else from your team then must try.|`|DfHFMEfraa	The rules are that both teams must line up for the faceoff and wait until the referee drops the puck before making a motion to clear the puck.  The away team must put their stick down first in the circle, then the home team puts theirs down.  If one of the players moves before the referee drops the puck, then that player is waived out and another player takes the faceoff.  If THAT person moves early too, then that team receives a 2 minute penalty for delay of game.<br>  <br>  Thats why when one team has a player thrown out of a faceoff, they usually just lose the faceoff so they dont risk taking a penalty|`|b2n2KLxLaa	A faceoff is the method used to begin play in ice hockey. The two teams line up in opposition to each other, and the opposing centres attempt to gain control of the puck after it is dropped between their sticks by an official.<br>  <br>  Faceoffs are typically conducted at designated places marked on the ice called faceoff spots or dots. There are nine such spots: two in each attacking zone, two on each end of the neutral zone, and one in the centre of the rink. Faceoffs do not always take place at the marked faceoff spots. If a puck leaves the playing surface, for example, the faceoff will take place wherever the puck was last played. However, all faceoffs other than those centre ice take place on one of the two imaginary lines parallel to the side boards extending from one end zone faceoff spot to the other.<br>  <br>  An official may eject a centre from the faceoff if he or any of the players on his team violates the rules in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage during the faceoff. In this case, one of his teammates that is on the ice must switch positions with the centre and take the faceoff. Common faceoff violations include moving the stick before the puck is dropped and not placing the body square to the faceoff spot. In the NHL, a visiting team's centre's hockey stick must touch the ice before the home team's centre does.|`|jDBCti6saa	Just to add to other comments.<br>  <br>  If one of the other players tries to jump the faceoff, their centre can also be thrown out. I have only seen it twice and both times it was after the player had done it multiple times in prior faceoffs.<br>  <br>  I don't mean the usual creeping in. I mean "start skating into the circle before the puck is dropped".

f7fb4038fb42556f85cea2ec65dfd073aa	Ok... so lets break this down.... there are 8 teams who make it to the playoffs in the Eastern Confrence and 8 different teams who make it to the Western Confrence.<br>  <br>  Round 1<br>  Seed #1 (Pistons) vs Seed #8 (Magic) Best of 7 Series<br>  Seed #2 (Cavs) vs Seed #7(Wizards) Best of 7 Series<br>  Seed #3(Raptors) vs Seed #6(Nets) Best of 7 Series<br>  Seed #4(Heat) vs Seed #5(Bulls) Best of 7 Series<br>  <br>  Round 2<br>  Game 1) Seed #1/8 vs Seed #4/5 Best of 7 Series<br>  Game 2) Seed #2/7 vs Seed #3/6 Best of 7 Series<br>  <br>  Round 3<br>  Winner of Game 1 vs Winner of Game 2 Best of 7 Series<br>  <br>  Every team plays in the playoffs plays a team according to their seed. Since the Pistons won, they are in the Second Round.  So, the Pistons will play the winner of Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls since that is the 4th Seed vs 5th Seed matchup. If the Pistons go on to win that game, they will be in the Eastern Confrence Finals which is like the semi-finals. <br>  <br>  And no... i do not think that the Nuggets have a chance to win it all. They might have a chance at getting past the Spurs, but nothing else. They are going to lose to the winner of the Suns/Lakers series.|`|50CFdI8Maa	One question at a time bro...<br>  See, there are 4 rounds in the playoffs, first round, semi finals, conference finals, and NBA finals, east vs. west.<br>  The championship will be given to the one who wins all 4 rounds of the playoffs.<br>  It does not matter whether you had all game sevens in all your rounds, so long as you win 16 games in the playoffs, you are the champion.<br>  Detroit has a big chance to win because of their fab 5. Hehe|`|bylvLGvRaa	There is always a possibilty they might win|`|e26e379c5016ba3a08d40ca9508effaeaa	There are 4 rounds. The 1st rounds has 16 teams, 8 from each conference. So there are 8 pairs of teams who will compete. Whoever in each pair reaches 4 wins will advance to the next round. So in the conference semi-finals (the 2nd round), there will be 4 pairs. Then again whoever in each pair wins 4 game advance to the conference finals (The 3rd round, only 2 pairs). Then, again, whoever wins 4 games in each pair will go to the NBA finals. Whoever wins 4 games in the NBA finals will be the NBA champions.

It is a best of 7 series. The pistons will have to beat a total of 3 teams on the East and the champion from the west to win the finals, all best of 7. The pistons will probably play the bulls, and i bet the winner of that series will make it to the championship and win.

lKD9zokRaa	In early newspaper accounts of Alabama football, the team was simply listed as the "varsity" or the "Crimson White" after the school colors. <br>       The first nickname to become popular and used by headline writers was the "Thin Red Line." The nickname was used until 1906. <br>       The name "Crimson Tide" is supposed to have first been used by Hugh Roberts, former sports editor of the Birmingham Age-Herald. He used "Crimson Tide" in describing an Alabama-Auburn game played in Birmingham in 1907, the last football contest between the two schools until 1948 when the series was resumed. The game was played in a sea of mud and Auburn was a heavy favorite to win. <br>       But, evidently, the "Thin Red Line" played a great game in the red mud and held Auburn to a 6-6 tie, thus gaining the name "Crimson Tide." Zipp Newman, former sports editor of the Birmingham News, probably popularized the name more than any other writer. <br>  <br>  I have seen a few sites that all claim the same story. Here is a link.|`|31454845585b0ad216ed0ec3ad08bba6aa	Well, the meaning has changed over the years. <br>  <br>  For instance, now it refers to the blood of all the coaches who have been lynched there by halfwit Alabama fans because they are not the Bear.|`|Ro48v78Haa	Crimson Tide comes from the Confederate soldiers from Alabama that when they fought on the battle field they looked like a crimson tidle wave.That said yall are right about when the nickname came about but that is when exactly what it means.|`|AA11728372	These two guys above me are correct, but they left out the famous newspaper line that coined the nickname. Alabama is their red jerseys were hitting hard against Auburn, and the line read "Alabama pounded on the Auburn team like a Crimson Tide." And thus, a legend was made.|`|AA11165010	The nickname "Crimson Tide" originated with the 1907 Iron Bowl, which occurred during or shortly after a particularly rainy day. Auburn, heavily favored to win, was forced to accept a tie with Alabama after a hard-fought game. Describing the game, one sportswriter described the offensive line as a "Crimson Tide", in reference to their crimson jerseys as they moved down field in the rain.
lKD9zokRaa	Grandslam refers to one athlete winning all 4 majors in a calender year (Jan-Dec). So the 4 major tournaments have come to be known as "Grandslam" events because of this. As to why those specific places were chosen I cannot say. Like in other sports, some cities or venues (stadiums) are far superior when it comes to hosting an event (and don't forget monetary backing), that they rise above and distinguish themselves from the rest of the field. The better an event, the more prestigious it becomes. The more fans it attracts the more money it makes and can payout to the atheletes. It could also have to do with various playing surfaces. Playing on Grass, Clay, and regular hard courts, all require specific skill sets, and test the athletes more than 4 events on the same type of surface would.|`|AA11599299	Australia - Australion Open (Jan)<br>  France - French Open or Rolland Garros (June)<br>  England - Wimbledon (June)<br>  US - US Open (Aug)
lKD9zokRaa	That is up to the discretion of the game's official scorer. If it was evident that the runner was likely going to be safe at first, I would definately score this as a base hit, and RBI. But if it was the reverse, and the runner would have been clearly out had the fielder decided to make a play to first, I would rule it as a fielder's choice, RBI.|`|065b430f4b4b9a58a8c14fa3b764d8c1aa	The fielder chose to go to the plate instead of taking the probable out at first.  That makes it a fielders choice.  <br>  <br>  If the shortstop had tried to go to first and the throw was late, that would have been an infield single.<br>  <br>  BTW, the runner scores on E2.|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	fielder's choice.  Scorer's discretion about an error on cathcer for dropping ball.  RBI can only be scored if no error is charged.<br>  <br>  Fielder's choice does not always have to generate an out -- it is just that the fielder chose to play on R1 at the plate.|`|I5yY4Styaa	It's a judgement call for the official scorer.  If he determines the runner would of been safe on a throw to first its a base hit.  If not its a fielders choice.  Either way the guy gets credit for an RBI.  As was said above the result of the play at home doesn't mean anything here because it wasn't a force play.  If it had been a force an out at home means no base hit and a fielders choice.|`|c253d89fae7f0e14cf95bdc87dc56764aa	It's a fielder's choice since the SS threw home, not to first. It doesn't matter whether an out was made [at the plate]. For scoring purposes, it is not a plate appearance.|`|f7a7e95fadcbcf9d7fcf81a7e2dfe958aa	its a hit|`|hTppjBMeaa	Up to your official scorer, but because it was hit in the hole, there was no guarantee the runner would be out at first.  I probably would score it as an infield hit and an error on the catcher for dropping the ball, (therefore no rbi) although I would have to see the play.|`|zy3ObrVRaa	you got it right, Fielders choice,  Error on the catcher and no rbi, It`s a unearned run.

lKD9zokRaa	The schedule is made by a company called Sports Scheduling Group. I was just reading this report on espn.com that talks about the subject. Here you go:|`|AjFpVBNBaa	Every team plays 18-19 games against each team in their division.  They also play 6-9 games against all other teams in their league (outside their division).  Finally, there are 18 (I think) interleague games for each team.  The interleague matchups rotate every year, ie: NL EAST teams play AL EAST one year, then AL CENTRAL the next, then AL WEST.  Also, there is always the interleague rivalries (Mets-Yankees) that are scheduled every year.  I think every team has this, I'm not sure.|`|AwPDcpuzaa	I wish I knew because it seems like every time I turn on ESPN it's always the Yankees vs. Redsox. I mean I love the rivalry and everything but talk about wearing something out. There's 162 games in a season and I think the Yankees and Redsox play each other 161 times.

If anyone was qualified to replace Nelson - AJ is just the guy. The Magic will be fine they are under the direction of a vet. Who also has a nicer shot than Jameer.

But each player has an agent, and any agent will try to negotiate the best contract possible for their client. Some players that were expected to be drafted very high have actually been passed over by many teams because they thought that the player would be difficult to sign (read demand more money than they were willing to offer) or wanted to go to college first.|`|47m48UAUaa	Several years ago MLB established a system of recommended signing bonuses to each pick in the first 10 rounds of the draft. Obviously the higher you go in the draft the higher the recommended bonus. There is no set $$ amount for first rounders and no amateur player drafted has ever received a $15m bonus - that's crazy! The highest bonus ever given to a draftee was in '05 to Justin Uptin at about $6m.
4WvWA0Jsaa	Truck width makes a difference if you are doing lots of flip tricks (the narrower, the easier) and when you're doing 50-50s, which i like to do a lot myself. I recently switched to a longer truck hanger to see how that affected my ride. What I found was that it takes a bit more precision in landing on rails, coping and ledges with narrower widths. That fact is pretty obvious, but what I'm saying that it's a give & take situation. It'll be easier for your trucks to connect on tricks, but you will sacrifice "flipability" and weight.<br>  <br>  OR you can just change the bushings on your current pair of trucks. I like my trucks pretty tight so I ride hard bushings. I'm not sure how you like yours, but keep in mind, the harder the tighter. I ride Shorty's Doh-Dohs. They've lasted as long as I've owned my trucks (2 years so far).<br>  <br>  About the Tensors.. You won't be able to tell if the kingpin will stick out after you adjust them from looking at them on the shelf or from a picture. New trucks, no matter what the brand, will always adjust the kingpin tightness only enough to ride. If you are worried about the kingpin sticking out on a new pair of Tensors, just switch out the stock bushing with hard(er) ones. You won't have to crank down on them too much to achieve rigidity and then the kingpin won't get in your way.|`|AA10239127	The only part of this question that I can answer is the difference between truck and board with. The wider the trucks, the less turning you'll have, but more stability, and vice-versa. so choose, turning or stability. you flip better with smaller trucks, and manual better with wider.|`|Nd43h1Lsaa	well i've been skateboarding for awhile and i didn't think the width even made a difference.  I would go with tensors though.  They are SICK!!! Get the Rodney Mullen's or Daewon Song's! thats what i would recommend|`|f9a62c794700e1f19ccd7f0649c6e421aa	I have always thought that the truck width needs to match your deck width but its really your choice and you can always tighten your trucks unless your bushings are bad or you need a new kingpin.|`|wI38dytRaa	you can tighten up your trucks you currently have
lKD9zokRaa	Why not? He never filed any retirement papers with the MLB offices. He simply took his time about DECIDING whether or not his was going to return for another season or officially retire. In the leagues I am in he was available in our draft in March and was taken in every league, except one, which is a keeper league. In that league, the owner was so sure Rocket would return, that he used a keeper spot to retain him so that no one else could pick him in our "free agent" draft. His decision to play is almost the same as an injured player missing the first 2 months of the season and someone realizing he's still on the waiver wire and picking him up right before he is activated. I see no difference.|`|ya1eDp9Haa	No he just made his decision known this weekend. Most leagues have already drafted and had to go by his last team which was NL.|`|a4778e09f64b00673a4e002289a9f490aa	Absolutely yes.<br>  <br>  Calculated gambles on draft day are allowed. I've also been in leagues where retired players were drafted by the scrubby managers in the late rounds...<br>  <br>  Everyone knew Clemens would play this year, it was just a matter of when and where.
lKD9zokRaa	Horticulture, Some agriculture degrees, Sports turf management. Most are available in both 2 year AA degrees and 4 year bachelor's degree. Most degrees in that field will provide you with a solid base to begin with. Most of those courses will teach you about grasses, weed identification, how to identify various plant diseases, as well as insect indentification. From there experience is the next step. Apply for an internship or seasonal job when available. One thing those courses teach very little of, if any, is how to take care of the skin, or infiled dirt. That is where an internship or part-time work can help. From ther it's just time until you gain enough experience to move up in position and potentially become the head groundskeeper if that's what you want to do.
lKD9zokRaa	Warren Moon - 161<br>  He also has the most fumbles recovered - 56|`|2ed2a5f177bc3aa5fd99ed0ef98c6924aa	Warren Moon.  QB for the Oilers, Vikings, Seahawks, and Chiefs|`|c9e0ff96009ccb260c4d7700325e32f3aa	Warren Moon at 161.  Moon passed Dave Krieg, who had 153.  Lot of QBs on the career fumbles list.  And the QBs that had the longest careers are the guys with the most fumbles.  Just the Law of Averages at work.  If you get hit 40-60 times a game, the guy in the most games is going to drop a few more than the short-career guy.
0234a5919425f2503a2245af18fde971aa	If the Sabres play like they did the last two games in NYR, then they will win it all. If not, then it's the Sens. Detriot vs Buffalo has that great Hasek story line. I think it comes down to goaltending and who has the better power plays.|`|JIvuToXVaa	Bring it home, Ottawa.<br>  <br>  Ottawa over Buffalo in 7 (it will be one he\_\_ of a series)<br>  <br>  Ottawa over Detroit in 7 (it will be one even he\_\_er of a series)<br>  <br>  That's right.  I said H-E-double-hockey-sticks.  Twice.|`|3Mm52vUZaa	Detroit Red Wings.<br>  <br>  Great goaltending, outstanding defense, and they have 4 lines that can score you goals.<br>  <br>  Not to mention the addition of Todd Bertuzzi has given the Red Wings some strength that they lacked from recent playoff years.<br>  <br>  If Dominik Hasek could play the rest of the playoffs like he did in Game 6 against the San Jose Sharks, I dont think any team would be able to beat them.|`|46c672e68876dc947a049383fdea25e0aa	since my Sharks choose not to participate in the final four I am going with Anaheim has much as that hurts to say, but the western teams are superior over the eastern teams this seasons|`|DfHFMEfraa	Ottawa...And why does this question get asked 30 times a day?|`|HuLfkeJeaa	Ottawa or Anahiem .... go with Ottawa this year.|`|CuCi91Joaa	Sabres because they are healthy and they have great depth, and scorers, amazing defence and good goalteanding<br>  not to mention the kids they have waiting for if someone gets hurt. <br>  They have great chemestry, momentum, and hatred for the other teams<br>  theyll take ottawa in 6<br>  and then the other team in 6 or 7|`|GvFMQ9Hbaa	Glad to see this question asked for the ninth time. Anyway, Sabres in 7 over Detroit. I live in Detroit but I think the Sabres have to much depth and Chris Drury is Mr Intangible!|`|e30170e5d503578cb8209dca293d0297aa	The team that wins eight more games will win the Cup, because that is the number of games required.  I think any of the four teams is good enough to win it.  Buffalo has the most depth and solid goaltending.  Ottawa has the best line in hockey right now, is playing well and is being the most physical.  Emery is due to lapse soon but he's been solid.  Anaheim has the best goaltending so far, although they've hardly been tested, and they have Neidermeyer and Pronger, which means they always have a stud on defense.  Detroit is winning and as long as none of their geriatrics break a hip or die of old age on the ice, they could win but that we be the biggest surprise.  This should be great hockey, especially Buffalo and Ottawa who are so fast and deep, it could be the kind of hockey the NHL has been wanting for two years.   Here's to seven solid games.

Don't use like coloring paint, it needs to be like wall paint because of the gritty dry. Coloring paint is to glossy.|`|rvE7gyuUaa	Honestly, I would not recommend painting your wheels.  If any get into the bearings it would be a disaster.  Remember, they aren't going to remember your wheels, just the fact that you just scored on them.

39cDZ7Nvaa	go to the doctor and get an x ray to make sure nothing is broken or fractured then they will give you a brace and medications|`|u8GHTJEEaa	First of all, the sciatic is not a muscle. It's a nerve which runs through the lower back (the lumbar and sacral areas) and branches out into the legs (this is the radial part of the diagnosis). Yours may be getting pinched or you may have an inflammmation. Take a pain pill and stay off your feet (lying on your back is best) for a few days. That, hopefully, will ease if not end the pain. It may return at some point, if so your physician can prescribe a stronger analgesic.     One more thing, even after the pain subsides, do NOT do any heavy lifting, as this will aggravate the condition.|`|M0eyMvqlaa	If your doctor told you what it is already, why are you asking us, shouldn't you be seeking some attention for it ? Peace!|`|geih5vR8aa	Vicodin, or something stronger, which you can get from your doctor.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Go to another doctor who will give you something for it.

AA10124856	People across the nation probably look at the hawks record as a whole and think things are fine. A   4 seed currently, but they've won only around 6 games since New Year's. I thought they've been playing just to be happy where they are. Woodson made a point though, teams gear up to slow down Joe, and get the ball out of his hands, so we'll see. Joe had been avergering under 20 pts a game all of Janurary so maybe some rest will do him good.   I thought the Hawks may lose anyway since they still have problems winning on the road and the Wolves have been on a roll.|`|95NYsIXUaa	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|`|YhfMrppSaa	Injuires really kills a team.

I think Hawks will be healthy to make a second half surge after the break. Right now they need to scrap and get wins the ugly way. I think the top seeds fear the Hawks slipping, more than you should. Hawks are a dangerous team and every team knows you are getting a top 4 seed in the first round if they were to slip and none of the other top seeds wants the Hawks in 1st rd.    With Minnesota coming off a road game the tonight, I will take the Hawks who will have lots of rest while Minnesota plays back to back. Hawks win 91-84 @ Minnesota.|`|C1tlS1GTaa	True it will hurt but don't fret.

Two, just show her what you can do, try getting involved in an exhibition or a tryout just one time and show her that you can take it.

BiMkowVMaa	Magic Johnson, my favorite player ever couldn't play D or dunk like Mike. Bird barely played defense and couldn't dunk or block shots. Kareem Abdul Jabbar couldn't hit a three pointer to save his life. Wilt is one of the all time worse free throw shooter ever. Bill Russell was not a good offensive player and couldn't hit three's. Duncan is a shaky free throw shooter and not a factor from three point line. MJ wasn't a real three point threat either... it was also not a part of his game. Oscar Robertson could do everything and he won only one ring.    They're all champs though. I didn't even cover all their weakness.    This is what...? LeBron 6th season?

LeBlowJob is overrated|`|EKF2HdZKaa	ur comparing lebron to michael jordan......pretty biased if u ask me  lebron is the 2nd best in the nba,but ur treating his shooting like he was shaq or something  labron isnt a clutch shooter yet,agreed but he is a decent shooter  plus hes still young and only 24,many great players werent clutch shooters at their youth (including kobe,mike)  seriously this overrated thing is getting old,some people are optimistic about him,that doesnt mean he is overrated  as for ur explanation u are pretty accurate,but ur comparin lebron to the g.o.a.t,and lebron is still a great player,a lay up counts for the same amount of points as a 17 foot jumper.  --------------------------------------...  im stating the truth.....both are worth 2 points|`|N8AJnAbuaa	hes is overrated     LeBron James. he never was and never will be. LeBron's career was a creation hyped by the media, including his scoring titles. the 2007 Finals exposed LeBron as what he truly is, a choke artist and a crybaby. without Big Z, LeBron will be another Vince Carter, flashy dunks zero rings. the best player right now is a tie between Dwayne Wade and Kobe Bryant.    LeBron James    ZERO NBA Titles AS A SIDEKICK(GIBSON CARRIED IN 2006!)  ZERO NBA TITLES AS PRIMARY LEADER  0 MVP Awards  0 Finals MVP        EDIT:     I forgot to mention he travels alot   0 Defensive Player of the Year  0 All Defensive 1st team  0 All Defensive 2nd team  0 Eighty One point games  0 Most Improved Player Honors  0 Steal Titles  0 Assist Titles  0 Seasons above 80% FT  0 NBA Finals Records Broken Or Set  0 Sixty Point Games  0 Forty Point NBA Final Games  0 Thirty Point NBA Final Games  9 Turnovers in a Half(Cavalier record)  1 Olympic Gold Medal(Heavily Assisted by Kobe Bryant&Dwyane Wade)  0 Games won in the NBA Finals    2007 NBA Finals: LeBron James was MANHANDLED by Bruce "Lee" Bowen, scoring an NBA Finals LOW OF 14 POINTS IN THEIR GAME 1 LOSS 76-85, on 4-for-16 shooting, and SIX turnovers!    Game 3: LeBron James was MANHANDLED once again by Bruce "Lee" Bowen, missing the potential game-tying 3 pointer attempt where he goes to the referee and WHINES THAT HE GOT FOULED BY BOWEN!  PROOF(CHOKE!):http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q9KJA6ON...    FG%age:LeBron James was MANHANDLED by Bruce "Lee" Bowen during the 4 game series, shooting just 36%.      i mean c'mon, king of what? what has he won? Kobe has 3 rings, Wade has 1, Lebron has zero, and that makes him the King? Kings are supposed to be conquerors, i haven't seen Lebron conquer anything except maybe ESPN and all the other media outlets overhyping him.    that is why i like Wade way more. he's earned his hype. no one talked about Wade when he came into the league, and yet he made his name for himself. Lebron was made way before he even played an NBA pre-season game, which is ridiculous. not that i'm saying Lebron sucks, i'm sure he can earn his own legacy, but the way media outlets are shoving Lebron down our throats you don't really feel any of this attention is real because no matter what Lebron does, they sing his praises, which i think is totally wrong.    a good example, ESPN on their website highlight videos, has Lebron's post-game interview up after they lost. LEBRON OVER-HYPED! let him earn something for once    oh, by the way, Lebron is a shoe-in for league MVP this season. the media outlets have made up their mind BEFORE THE SEASON STARTED. really, they just wanted to give Kobe one as a formality so they did that last seaeson. believe me, in Stern's office there's a 2008-09 MVP trophy with Lebron's name already engraved on it. its all a conspiracy. everything is handed to him.|`|39cDZ7Nvaa	yes i do i dont really like his attitude and hes to cocky to me i mean hes a great player but as good as he is he still gets shut down by like kobe and bruce bowen|`|GBGcI509aa	LBJ is the best in the leuge.|`|zFlfIOQwaa	absolutley not. he is perfectly rated and if you dont beleive me i will prove it right now.  Ok come on we all know that the top 3 players in the NBA are(not in any order):  LeBron  D-Wade  and Kobe   compare them on www.NBA.com just go to players,then look for lets say LeBron and to the right of his picture there is a sign that says compare and u should know what 2 do from there. compare him to kobe and wade and u tell me if he is overrated.  HE IS NOT OVERRATED!!!LOOK AT HOW MANY MVP'S HE HAS GOTTEN ALREADY?!?!?HE BROUGHT HIS TEAM BY HIM SELF LAST YEAR ALLLLLLL THE WAY TO THE CONFERENCE FINALS AND ALMOST BEAT THE CELTICS ALL BY HIMSELF!!!!NOW,,,IS THAT OVERRATED TO YOU?|`|pNzlwHkOaa	True lebron doesnt have a consistent shot, but he's a streaky shooter... When he's hot, he can stroke it from everywhere... Just as good as anyone else in the league... Also, remember Kobe didnt always have a nice shot all his career either, for a long time he was airballing 3's...    And the whole argument about layups and dunks.... That just shows that Lebron is more capable of scoring than Kobe is... Dont you think everyone would get to the hole everytime if they could? Those are the easiest and safest shots, players mostly only take jumpers when they are forced to settle for them..... LeBron can score at will, which is why, like u said, almost 80% of his points come from layups/dunks...    Another thing, the AST totals.... Kobe didnt always play in the triangle, remember when Rudy coached him? His assists numbers then still werent higher than LBJ's, so you cant blame the triangle.... Also, regardless of the triangle, Kobe is in control of the ball more than any other Laker... Which is why some games you see him have 10+ assists... He's just not as willing a passer as lebron...    I give Kobe his credit...His stroke is alot more consistent than LBJ's, but who needs that when you can get the easy 2 going to the basket, maybe even the And 1?    EDIT: Didnt LeBron just hit a game winning shot not too long ago?     I admit Kobe is more polished than LeBron, but LeBron is a better all around player.... You should admit the same....|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	yeah he can make lay ups but the thing is he creates them with his good dribbling and his power to get to the hole that power no forward ever has had. also he sets his players up all the time and yes he can hit a jumper and he isn't horrible at 3's just not good and he is a forward what can you expect? also FT last time i checked 79% wasn't bad for the NBA|`|NvDtr9gzaa	He can shoot jumpers and 3-pointers, he's just not consistent.|`|FWKEw2jCaa	Until Lebron can shoot 3s and long 2s consistently, he is not going to be better than Kobe..|`|nJJUEY8Waa	It's hard to overrate a great player, like lebron, he is great, by the way.  But, he might be one of the most overrated players ever.  Steve Nash is still  1, though.  Kobe is still clearly the best in the league.  It's amazing, but Kobe should have the last 5 MVPs, so, I guess he would be way underrated.  All those awards are politics.  Everyone knows, the only person who can stop Kobe is Kobe.  Sure, if you double team him every possession, he won't kill you, but he'll find the open man, and that guy has to knock down an open shot, just like with any other team.  Jordan rarely shot 3s, partially because he didn't need to, but neither does kobe, but jordan isn't even close to as good as a 3 pt. shooter as kobe.  If kobe was a spot up shooter like vujacic or korver, he would be well over 40%.  It's no secret lebron can't shoot well and that he travels/carries the ball almost every possession, but they rarely call the violation on him.  In the lakers' system, kobe isn't required to dominate the ball.  In the cavs system, lebron does that most of the time, thus, lebron's stats will usually look better, misleading others into thinking that he's better than kobe.  Kobe is still better offensively and defensively than lebron, lebron wins with intangibles, but kobe dominates him when it's crunch time.|`|7E7HzYrRaa	lmao a little. i mean he is 6'8 270 lbs. thats just not fair :)
qyATAaeXaa	Here's the link to the PA Ski Area Association webpage.  http://www.skipa.com/indexwinter0809w.ht...    That link will take to to all of the ski areas' pages in PA. Each one has some sort of deal, package plan, or special. If you can go midweek instead of on a weekend you will save a bunch.     Seven Springs is out west in PA and not close to you. Liberty, Round Top, Ski Denton, and Sawmill are not in the Poconos either and are probably not worth driving to from the NJ/NY area. Camelback, Jack Frost, and Blue Mountain are probably your best bang-for-the-buck. Elk Mountain is the best place in PA in my opinion. It's a bit more out of the way, but usually not as crowded as the other Pocono resorts.    You don't have many choices in NJ. Mountain Creek is just as costly as the larger Pocono resorts.    Just like PA, NY State has a website for all of its resorts too.  http://www.skiandrideny.com/    I'm pretty sure Gore Mtn is doing the 1/2 price lift tickets on Wednesdays again this year if you bring a Coke can to the ticket booth. If you visit a local ski shop they might have coupons or know of some specific deals they can clue you in on. I unfortunately can't give you a lot of specific deal info because due to my industry connections and ski patrol membership I usually just call someone I know at a resort and ski for free or get a massive discount, so I don't even really pay too much attention to posters and coupons anymore. I bet someone at a ski shop near you will have some specific deal info.    While you are at the ski shop, inquire with them about their rentals. Usually you can get rentals from a ski shop cheaper than you can at the mountain. Likewise, you can usually get demonstration skis and boots for the same price as resort rentals. These are almost always better quality goods than resort rentals.     Best of luck.|`|7lTIiL60aa	most def i can help im a teler from pa we know all the spots ok so here is the deal ski denton pa has 15 lift ticktet and 15 rentels on thrusday ski sawmill has tue 12.50 for lift 12.50 for rentels pluse cheap cabbins big boulder in the poconos has a half of ski day i think its wed if u need directions or any outher info on sking email me|`|DhEZj9cKaa	No
8jViRw5qaa	I think the SD title might change, the only reason why not, because Vickie will probably make Edge enter last. And it's a no DQ match with gives advantage to him.     WQ 2: His other title reigns had him feuding with the royal rumble winner.  This time the royal Rumble winner(Orton) isn't feuding with Cena, so Orton is in the main event. Also we're are seeing one of the best storylines in years with the JBL-HBK storyline.|`|vPpiHZSSaa	I don't think any titles will change.    Cena's reign is better than the last one. The last one was boring to me, not that I hate him. I'm glad of this new gimmick the writers are giving John Cena. The Blue and Black H.L.R. gimmick. This gimmick reminds me of his old aggressive days as having his word life gimmick. It really seems like the bookers are letting him use a lot of his moves again which is really cool.|`|WK6vrkdKaa	I hope so because IMO its a repeat of 2 years ago..Cena and Edge as the champions..so its time for something new...    WQ2:Because Cena sells merchandise and WWE now-a-days only go by how many toys or shirts you sell..|`|dcNT65mTaa	I think Jeff will win his title back.    If you're face too long, ppl get tired of u. If you're heel too long, ppl get irritated with u. He needs to change things up. Ppl are getting tired of his superman style, always saving the day, always winning but mainly its cuz he really doesn't have a feud right now. He needs a good feud. Swagger beating Hardy was huge, and then Matt screwing Jeff outta da WWE title is even bigger right now.|`|1MdaqyL2aa	i dont think the World Heavyweight championship will change until wrestlemania.       The WWE championship might change hands but since the main storyline right ow doesnt involve the championship it may not.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	i don`t think there will be title changes. Just to close to mainia.    Its because they have other interesting storylines going. The infamous reign was pretty much just cena.

Y2tr5XDPaa	Before you think about meeting with coaches, make sure your son has played a good amount of USTA tournaments and has an impressive ranking.  If you want him to get a scholarship, he needs to play Division 1, meaning he basically needs a national ranking to even be considered.  If so, I would make a tennis video of highlights and send it to some coaches his sophomore year.      Another option is Division 3 NESCAC schools, which is considered the best D3 tennis conference in the country.  All the schools are also academically superb (Williams, Amherst, Bowdoin, etc...)

pWnvpLyCaa	It looks like you probably could, but the question is why?  Unless you already own one or both of these units, there are much better options available.  The Magellan 315 is a 10 year old design, and there have been major improvements in receiver sensitivity and accuracy since then.  The Garmin III is better suited to use in an automobile, but on the other hand I seem to remember someone years ago using one for caching, so if my memory's correct it can be done.  Again though you are dealing with an obsolete GPS with more modern options available.  The current GPS of choice for serious cachers remains the Garmin 60CSx, although the Oregon units are making inroads.  Also, DeLorme has a new unit, the PN-40, which shows promise, but I can't recommend it yet  - it seems a work in progress.|`|tGw60KJUaa	These two model is a old model and not popular in present.    Now the best GPS for Geocaching, I am suggestion a Garmin GPSMap 60CSx  or a Garmin eTrex Vista HCx :  Garmin 60CS just got a whole lot better. The 7.5-ounce GPSMap 60CSx now features an insanely accurate, high-sensitivity GPS receiver by SiRF that tracks your position even in tree cover and canyons. Plus, you get a bright, sunlight-readable color TFT display and an included a 64 MB microSD card for storage of optional map detail. Add all that to the 60CSx's integrated barometric altimeter and electronic compass, and you've got a unit that is ready to take you anywhere on land or sea.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSO...

brd6l4MAaa	Best: Dec 11th. Hurricanes/Flyers. After being down 5-1 going into the third period, the Flyers made an unbelievable comeback to win the game 6-5 in the shootout. Scott Hartnell got a hat trick that night.    Worst: Jan 31st. Flyers/Blues. The Flyers not only lost to the Last-in-the-West Blues in St. Louis, but were shut out 4-0. They didn't look good at all.|`|d9329ea0bdca3de02039a3f70fc57a5faa	Rangers fan    Best: It varies    It could be the first time we played penguins where we were down 2-0 in third period and then tied it with 7 SECONDS LEFT with a goal by Nikolai Zherdev and won it in overtime.     Or it could be the second Blackhawks game when we took 11 PENALTIES (half of them not being penalties) and only gave up one PP goal and we went on to win it in overtime.    Worst: Probably when Valiquette gave up 5 goals in the last 10 minutes of the Leafs-Rangers game and we lost 5-4 when we had a 4-0 lead after the first period against the Caps before Christmas.    Best game while still losing: Last game against Bruins. We gave up only one goal and got a lot of shot against BOSTON BRUINS, one of the best teams in the NHL.|`|1035b561c3cc75bd52fa0a1ec4ef8d3caa	Omg like every game in the 8 game devil winning streak that went to overtime because i wanted the streak to live and they did it without brodeur     Everybody was scoring, it was truly a team winning effort.    The Worst would be today Devils vs Washington, because of a crappy call that should of been a devils powerplay the devils lost ending the streak.    Also because granted first 10 mins of the game Devils were shaky, but they played their hearts out losing 3 - 0 to come back all the way to 3 - 2 Rupp about to make it 3 -3  and a crappy call, heart breaking i wanted to cry on the way home     Sorry if i ruined the game for anybody|`|wSq80V1xaa	Pittsburgh Penguins    Best: Many good games, but we haven't had a GREAT game.    Worst: Loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning.  That's self-explanatory.  I was at that game too.|`|DvBPLP4saa	Best: (Though goaltending wasn't so hot) Back in November when the Penguins visited the Joe. The Red Wings were winning 5-2, but the Penguins refused to give up. Something inside of all them sparked. I don't know what it was........maybe it was the fact all of them wanted to show Hossa why he should still want to be here, or maybe they didn't want to be embarrassed by the Red Wings again.....who knows? But Jordan Staal got a hat trick in the third period and Ruslan Fedotenko got the OT winner to win the game for the Pens 7-6. Like I said goaltending wasn't that great, but all the forwards worked together as a team to find a way to win. And that's what good teams do.....find a way to win.    Worst game: Oh God. With the season the Pens have had this year there's a lot.    Oct. 28th vs. San Jose (in San Jose) - If I remember right the Pens only had 11 shots on goal. >:O 2-1 Sharks. (Goaltending for the Pens was outstanding though)    Dec. 20th vs the Leafs (in Pittsburgh) - The Penguins lost 7-3. You should never lose 7-3 to the Leafs.|`|Xl7UHNB1aa	best most entertaining game this season red wings vs. sharks @ san jose sharks win 6-5.    worst   loss to chicago 4-2 =P|`|YTwnVAtdaa	the best was at a Devils game.

Then we scored two more and we ended up kicking the rangers as$ 8-5!!  THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	Best Game(s): Every Game Pittsburgh Penguins lost.  Worst Game(s): Every Game Pittsburgh Penguins won.|`|tR0YwMzMaa	Pitt Penguins.     Worst- Penguins vs. Devils a week ago. we were winning 3-1 with a minute left in the game. ended up loosing 4-3 in overtime.   best- well, this season i don't think they've played great very often, so i can't answer that question yet.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	best: any game that the hurricanes shut out teams, but no one game that was that good  worst: the game where we lost 6-4 against toronto was bad, but we shut them out the next game we played them|`|hHXG8ef6aa	Sens: ALL WORST HORRIBLE GAMES! no best|`|UoUaO52taa	Best: 1-14, W 5-4 SO at Dallas Stars  Great comeback from 3-0 to win in a 6rd shooutout.    Worst: 12-1, L 2-0 vs. Nashville  Ahn ugly game all around. Shutout at home by the Preds and PEKKA RINNE. We just sucked|`|NJCd95W0aa	Oilers.    Best games - 7-2 W against Columbus, and 3-1 W against Minnesota (very important divisional + conference game, as well as next game after a 10-2 L)    Worst games - 9-2 L against Chicago and 10-2 L against Buffalo. Don't think I need to explain why. >_>|`|XI2iylR4aa	Islanders    Best game: Tonight was pretty good, except when they got lazy and unfocused in the last period.    Worst: Uhhh, almost every other game.  Embarrassing.  Maybe next year they'll be good.  It seems like we say that every year.|`|m9eySP2Paa	devils vs. penguins    langenbrunner in overtime was so amazing!!!!!!|`|3KD1wCs5aa	BEST: Kings v Ducks 4-3 W  Awesome because we beat the Ducks and any good Kings fan knows we hate them.  To add insult to injury, they got a hat trick and we still won.  Awesome.    WORST, but also BEST: Kings v Red Wings 0-4 L  Well, we got shut out, so that was pretty lame; however, we got shut out by an awesome team.  It was amazing to see the wings, not to mention all of the wings fans in LA.  It was half red in the staples center.    P.S. Jack Johnson shortly returned after and things are looking a little brighter :)|`|BrWVhd9naa	For Sharks         Best game 7 to 1 over Tampa Bay (I went to that game)  Worst game 0 to 6 loss to detroit red wings|`|EpCOXauLaa	The best game was Calgary vs Vancouver only because they won really bad and I had my friends over to watch the game.   And the worse was the last time Calgary played the sharks and we lost really bad. Just a shame. The sharks are so good with great stats this year it would have been nice to win.|`|SCiY5JESaa	The Flames all season so far but they lost to nashville last night the only complaint|`|e3hVn0LZaa	Maybe the November 15th win in the SO over the caps. The games was great and amazing and the Clemmenson poke check on Boyd was amazing. Started to turn around the season after Marty went down, started Clemmers season too. Great game.    Worst was the highly embarrassing loss to the Thrashers at home 4-0, no need to explain. but fortunately i had forgotten about it because of the 8 gm win streak.|`|XrNVTTnTaa	Best Game: DEVILS VS. Penguines on Doc Emeric Night   Amazing games =)   Worst: Game vs. Rangers never should let them tie it or get the ranger's fans hopes up. Even though we still won i think that i never should of happened, or the Game that Marty went down (btw hes expected to be back Feb. 26th according to http://njmg.typepad.com/devilsblog/2009/...|`|Wd6kAQvKaa	Canucks: Best: 6-0 win over the Flames               Worst: the past 9 games. FIRE AV NOW!!|`|9jNBcvYmaa	Detroit Redwings: either Winter Classic vs Chicago or beating San Jose 6-0. Winter Classic was extrememly special on national tv and san jose is an elite team. Worst has to be letting Rick Nash getting a hatrick and a shorty when Datsyuk and Lidstrom were out.

Vy2L7Xopaa	Yeah ok maybe MJ won it all but he had it all including other players that can score!  Kobe basically got his team into the playoffs by himself!! If any of you kobe haters seen him the only thing you would say to him would be "Can I have your autograph?" Yeah  thats right you know its true so give him some respect!<br>  <br>  This guy is right! stats dont change so give it up!!!|`|2LUFVPrAaa	Tell me where you got your Source<br>  anyone can put up numbers like that|`|Ae9cxzTKaa	Well, anyone can trot out stats that only favor their case. <br>  <br>  The Bulls team you mentioned attempted 6.9% more FGs than Baby Kryant's 2006-07 LALers.<br>  MJ took 25.7% of his team's FG attempts; Kryant, 26.3%.<br>  MJ made 53.9% of FGA versus 46.3% by Baby Kryant.<br>  Baby Kryant also turned the ball over about 25% more than MJ (255-202), blowing several more chances to chuck wild shots.<br>  <br>  Addressing the ballhog bit, yes, Baby Kryant outperforms MJ by a considerable amount. MJ took fewer of his team's shots than Baby Kryant, who would have gunned even more but for his generous lead in turnovers.<br>  <br>  Baby Kryant will always fail to stack up in comparisons to MJ. I'm glad I am disinclined to tout Baby Kryant's greatness, because the argument has so many holes in it.<br>  <br>  One other statistical category where Baby Kryant outperforms the great and classy MJ is in whining. Season averages, career totals, you name it--Baby Kryant outwhines MJ by a very large margin.<br>  <br>  Add notes: Of COURSE it doesn't matter who won if the answer doesn't aid your case!<br>  <br>  Some idiot letterwriter thinks I cannot spell Baby Kryant's name correctly, calling it a misspelling. Too much a moron to understand that it is a NICKname, but has nothing else to try and shred like the pertinent numbers I have graciously supplied. Wow, this one has no sense whatsoever. <br>  <br>  "SurpriZed"? LMAO at God's gift to spellers!!!|`|NaIiT2Zoaa	look at the % difference.  that says a lot.|`|Vt7MbHm7aa	those stats are nice,,,didnt the bulls win the championship that year,,i cant remember oh yeah the lakers won one game in the playoffs...kobe is no jordan,,just an above average allstar on a really bad team,,,anyone who truly knows and understands basketball would never put kobe anywhere near mj..|`|0CnW95saaa	Kobe isn't a ball hog...he's just colorblind and doesn't know anyone's on his team.|`|ARvEqb5saa	kobe isnt a ball hog hes a scorer its just alot of kobe haters looking to knock him from every angle they can.

These kittys love to win when nothing's on the line, but when it counts, they get smacked by those guys in Black & Gold.<br>  The Ravens: No offense to speak of, can't understand how Mc Nair stays alive & yes, their defense is not what it once was, age wise or talent wise. Lewis should either be in prison or a psych ward & is not even the best LB on his own  team. These guys do not have the players on the roster to continue at last year's pace.<br>  And last, but not least, The Steelers: Everyone's in a panic about a new coach & losing Alan Faneca. Hate to see #66 leave, but he's just looking for the $$$ that his skill can demand. Too bad his age is against him. The Steelers have a habit of losing top notch players that go elsewhere for big money & are rarely as effective as they were with the Steelers: Kirkland, Lloyd,Harris, Dawson, K.Greene, Hope , Randal El,etc. And as to a new coach, remember that the Steelers went to the play-offs with some first year head coach that no one had ever heard of (Cowher) & have done OK since. TheSteelers have a habit of being their own worst enemy, but really putting things together when it counts. Even last season, for as lousy as they played at times, the managed to rally the last part of the season & again ruin the post season for a few teams (notably the Bungals!)<br>   Yes the Steelers can easily win the division as long as they stay reasonably healthy.|`|3823d01aa0a1b3df6709ae71a987ea49aa	Nope, this division belongs to the Ravens in 08. The Ravens now have a good RB to run behind a strong O-Line and they have a QB waiting in the wings. Bengals will finish 2nd, mainly because of their usual strong offense. Then the Steelers and Browns are both gonna be weak this year. Interesting to see how the Steelers act with Tomlin as coach, since he's nowhere close to as tough as Cowher, and if the Browns can find put it together since they have young talent but they're making simple mistakes.|`|7e448491a6c2b7f20e6d586f5e4f2701aa	Ravens & Bengals will battle for the division champs. Pittsburgh will come in a distant 3rd with Cleveland in the basement (again) with another 4-12 season|`|k2Eso8XDaa	Well for 2008 (the next season after this upcoming one), i'd say they have an above average shot to win the division.<br>  <br>  The Ravens are very good on Defense, but if you look closely, some of their key starters are getting past 30: Ray Lewis (32) Chris McCaslister (31) Trevor Pryce (33) and Samari Rolle (30). So by 2008 age might be catching up with them, maybe mabye not, well see. Also Steve Mcnair is getting up in years too (34) so by 2008 they might have to start looking for a new QB cause with McNair's type of play, i say 2-3 years top left in him.<br>  <br>  The Browns....there going to take a while, maybe by 2008 they'll be good enough to chase a wild card berth, but not the Division<br>  <br>  The Bengals are loaded on offense for years to come, but that defense is still a liability and until they fix it (and keep people out of jail) there going to have a hard time even getting into the playoffs.<br>  <br>  Bottom Line: The Steelers are a good team, but in order to win the division, they need to stay productive on offense (especially with Alan Faneca, their best gaurd, leaving after 07), find a replacement for Joey Porter on Defense unless Lawrence Timmons is good by then, and hope Age catches up with the Ravens.|`|2309e4a811335d9cc0c1ff7a7b6d5bb8aa	i hardly see the steelers going anywhere. Big ben could still be recovering from his motorcycle/car crash is mid July next year, they didnt re-sign Ken Wisenhunt, which was(and is) a great head coach for my cards in Arizona. The steeleers have never really had a passing game next to Hines Ward, and O.J. Simpson. Bettis is gone, so there go scaring the defense out of thier jerseys.Also, letting Joey Porter go to Miami was a huge mistake. They only drafted one linebacker in the draft, who was Lawerence Timmons, thier 1s round pick. Due to Porter leaving Pits, Miami has one of the best defenses out there. He will be playing amongst Zach Tomas, Channing Crowder (who had a great rookie year), and Jason Taylor.|`|3r1rX2AHaa	The steelers can win the AFC North. With their new coach who I think can do them wellwill have a major impact. If Ben is healthyhe has a lot of targets he can go to. The Bengals and Ravens will compete vigorously and both also have the weapons to win the division.|`|87wpvTTVaa	Um, I dont think so.<br>  <br>  1) Rothelisbergr - after the car accident, hes seemed a little on edge with his on the fly calls, which makes him alot more conservative than he was in the super bowl year<br>  <br>  2) You don't have a stable running game - With out Bettis, you don't have that "Holy crap here he comes" kind of running game, from watching the steelers play, they are more of a power running schematic team, now this is my opinion i may be wrong however<br>  <br>  3) Your Division - Despite your analysis of your division rivals, You have quite alot of talent to face, especially with the Johnsons in Cincinnati, a consistent defense in Baltimore, and a fresh new offense in Cleveland.<br>  <br>  So in conclusion, call the steelers owner, tell him to hire a new offensive coordinator, and cross your fingers|`|8fc54b11f244823721f457e1e239bfccaa	yes - ravens lost adalius thomas<br>  steelers only lost porter<br>  <br>  pats for super bowl|`|AA10484455	I agree if they don't have a season like the last one the Ravens should be the only competition and the Bengals will be in there also.|`|MOl7cIAGaa	The Steelers will compete with the Bengals for the division.  Baltimore doesn't have a qb or receivers to win.  Does the guy who said the Steelers don't have a running gane ever hear of Willie Parker.  Check the stats from last year he is near the top in rushing.|`|SPCyHAFLaa	It will be tough but with all of the players that the browns and ravens have picked up through the draft it will probably be tight.|`|jpWtZUEqaa	The only team that can be eliminated now is the Browns. The Bengals have a scary good offense and Lewis is a defensive guy so its only a matter of time before he whips that D into shape. The Ravens D will always be good regardless of age as someone mentioned earlier because they are one of the best at replacing players on defense. I also think their offense is going to be better then most people think, now that Jamal Lewis has carried his 3 yard butt to Cleveland. With that said as a Ravens fan the Steelers always scare me, so although I dont think they will win it, I will admit that they have a good chance.|`|kbpAiH8Maa	ur right and because im a die-hard steelers fan i believe the black and gold will come through|`|nNK9xWS1aa	Yes. Hopefully Ben will become his old self again, and we should be fine.|`|AA12076287	Well the Bengals had a great last yr so they cant be too bad this year.

L'unica cosa su cui potrebbero competere è il tocco di palla, proprio per la minor potenza hanno più sensibilità nei colpi, il problema è che a forza di racchettate alle palline si tende a perdere ache quella in parte.<br>  E tu pensa che la differenza si accentua ulteriormente sul veloce (cemento, erba, sintetico).<br>  <br>  Per fare un paragone è come se Ian Thorpe nuotasse i 200 stile contro un bambino di 10 anni, lo doppierebbe una ventina di volte. Il limite atletico femminile nel tennis purtroppo è molto inferiore a quello maschile. E non si può modificare con l'allenamento, infatti anche riuscendo a far aumentare la potenza delle atlete perderebbero l'elasticità necessaria a giocare i colpi e quindi alla fine giocherebbero peggio.|`|S9KLx5C2aa	Vorrei vederti contro una delle venus...<br>  non avresti speranze|`|zBE86xwpaa	be la sharapova è la seconda del mondo quindi non puoi dire che non è brava, e se cmq fosse una pippa meriterebbe lo stesso dato che è una f.i..g.a della madonna
8qNgdbA9aa	Maradona il 37, baggio il 38. Nei loro numeri piccoli di scarpe si racchiude la loro fortuna. Infatti un piede minuto riesce a colpire il pallone esattamente di collo o di esterno.

DFMcDa6Kaa	crawford is a beast. However the team he is playing for is just not good. If he were on any other team he would be a superstar like an A-rod or Big Papi. As far as outfielders go he is in the top 10 easily. I don't know if he ever is out of form but I think as the season goes he will get stronger. I would expect him to have a break out second half. Or he will be top in the Al for steals again|`|64f99dfac1ffafe334558c70f04684f7aa	He is on a really bad team, I've been wondering the same thing because I have him on my team.  Unfortunately, he has very little trade value from what I can tell, so our best bet seems to be holding onto him. I was also reading an article that there have been rumors of a trade in the area. I can't remember where that was, somewhere on ESPN i think.  I would love to see him go somewhere with a contending team, but then again that is probably just wishful thinking. G Luck|`|0pLcEgU1aa	I think u should keep him.  He a great ball player.  He'll get out of the slump.  He will give u alot of points from his stolen bases

WWE needs to start pushing better wrestlers anyone besides Cena.|`|P4wdjPO7aa	Well, when you have a character like Undertaker he doesn't have to be involved in a title match to be a must-see line. In his early years Hogan, Ric Flair, and those were more established superstars. Undertaker was more a "character". Yet, he is a 5 time champion. The days of 16-time champions (Ric Flair) are long gone. There are more superstars to share titles with, so everyone is going to get a piece of the title less often.<br>  <br>  As for the rest of the comment, I don't think a merry-go-round of title holders would be good for the show in the long run. I am against Cena being the guy though.<br>  <br>  However, has anyone else noticed after watching Friday Night Smackdown that RAW heavyweights look much much smaller?<br>  <br>  P.S. Undertaker only lost the title so soon because of a legit injury to his arm. He is not retiring he is out 6-8 months. Perhaps a surprise attack on Edge?

HE WON'T COS HE IS A COWARD|`|805a76b8f5c2c8cc13c121d74753809aaa	it will definitely affects his performance, and i bet this will be a major excuse if floyd doesnt perform well.    he can still win a fight, but ranked fighters are A-rank level and he will have trouble especially with a conditioned fighter. more likely that he will lose. practice and sparring are all different from competition. what he need is a tune up game to pre conditioned not only the body but also the mind.    with all due respect...its easier to grab a ball then shoot it anywhere in the court than having your face being punch. even with god given talent...floyd and michael are all in a different world. floyd is on his own when he step into the ring while jordan has 4 other pals he can depend to.

AA12089021	There are a number of factors involved with the Canadian teams moving south.  Some of the other answers touched on these reasons.  The bottom line for all of these reasons is money though.<br>  <br>  One of the biggest issues has been the strength of the Canadian dollar compared to the American dollar.  This means that if a Canadian team earns $100 and an American team earns $100 the Canadian team is actually earning less money.  Essentially, the Canadian teams were not on an equal playing field.  As salaries and operating expenses grew, it became more and more difficult for Canadian teams to afford their more talented players.  This played a larger factor than population.  For example, Quebec actually has a larger population (682K) than Denver (554K) where the Nordiques moved to.  Phoenix (1.3M) on the other hand has a larger population than Winnipeg (650K) so in some cases that was a factor.<br>  <br>  A major factor with franchises being awarded to Phoenix, Nashville, Tampa, Florida and Atlanta is Gary Bettman's plan to bring hockey to the masses.  He felt that he could bring the sport to the US and it would flourish, which to this point appears to be rather short sighted.  Hockey is, and most likely always will be, a regional sport.  This compounded with the $80 million dollar franchise fee made it a bit too much for the owners to turn down which is why we have two Florida teams, Nashville and Atlanta.  It is supported in the places it is played and there has been tremendous growth in youth hockey in the areas the NHL has expanded to.  California and Florida teams have won USA Hockey national championships in recent years.  However it still remains the 4th sport in the vast majority of areas of the US.  <br>  <br>  With the new Collective Bargaining Agreement, the salary cap and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, things are looking up for the possibility of teams returning to Canada.  The playing field has been leveled for the most part.  As US teams in cities such as Nashville struggle, there will be a push to move them to Canadian cities where the general population grew up with and are passionate about the game.|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Population.  Canada has a population less than California's... and over half live in the Windsor, Quebec City Corridor.  <br>  <br>  So if you think of the popularity of hockey in the country... California has a couple million more people than Canada, it has 3 teams.  Canada has less of a population, has 6 teams, and used to have 8 teams until they were sold and moved to larger US cities.<br>  <br>  I think population just has everything to do with it.  The NHL is a business, it'll go to who'll buy it the most.|`|C1aFhbUMaa	A number of issues besides the larger markets played into the movement of teams.  Bettman's desire for a national tv contract made putting franchises in the US his one true priority.<br>  There were also underlying economic factors.  At one time the Canadian dollar was worth 80 cents US which meant money lost in exchange because teams in Canada collected in money in Canadian dollars but paid their players in American dollars.  The other issue was salary expenses that were out of control made it even harder to compete for the Canadian teams.  The cap has fixed that.|`|AA10794249	When salaries started escalating, it killed professional teams in Canada. At the time, our dollar was low. Canadian teams couldn't afford to pay huge salaries which are in american dollars. Because of our low dollar, our teams made less from ticket sales than American teams even though we sold drastically more tickets. Because of these factors, the smaller market teams in Canada closed and were relocated to the US. It isn't just small market Canadian teams this happened to. Hartford and Minnestota also lost teams, and they are great hockey cities.<br>  <br>  Canadian hockey fans were angry at all this....seeing our teams leave and go to places where people couldn't care less about hockey. Last year Carolina won the Stanley Cup, a lot of people (most?) in the state didn't even know they had a team. <br>  <br>  It angered Canadian hockey fans that the NHL placed a higher importance on acquiring new American fans than retaining existing Canadian ones. Its nothing at all against Americans, just frustration directed towards the league.<br>  <br>  Good question....hopefully this answered it for you.|`|DfHFMEfraa	the States have bigger markets and can make more money...outside the major Canadian cities, there arent large markets like the U.S has, so they dont make as much money.  Take a team like Nashville and compare it to Winnipeg and the City of Nashville has a higher population and higer income per capita, which means more rich people going ot games.<br>  <br>  In Nashville's case though those people arent going to the games, which is why the team got sold...|`|HuLfkeJeaa	It is all about Money.|`|ZeZqk5C7aa	bah......the brandon wheat kings are still here|`|BJwTRPR8aa	Money..for all the reasons previously stated.<br>  <br>  I do take issue though with one opinion expressed that Quebec (city, i presume) had a larger population than Denver.  firstly, they are essentially identical and the Avalanche would be pulling fans from the denver-aurora-boulder metropolitan areas which is somewhere around 3 million with a better income per capita I am guessing.  Colorado allegedly possesses 10 of the 100 richest counties in the US.<br>  <br>  Strangely though, i liked the Nordiques better than the avalanche even though it was the same team|`|mdNkDc1saa	Because a few years ago the Canadian teams couldnt compete because the dollar was so much stronger (used to be 60%)  so the teams couldnt pay the players contracts that were in US dollars--and they couldnt charge the season ticket holder more for the tickets.
r7TnaIHGaa	I would do it in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  1. The three hitters you mentioned should easily cover for the loss of Vlad Guerrero (A-Rod could probably do it alone)<br>  <br>  2. Delmon Young was a highly touted individual who is sure to pick up the pace sometime soon<br>  <br>  3. You are getting the #1 pitcher in fantasy baseball.  Even if you decide to toss Santana, you can get a ton of value out of him|`|48sMJkIoaa	After viewing your pitching staff I would do it.  You have A-Rod, Berkman and Dunn to cover for the loss of Vlad's power numbers.|`|fb6673ae4d70f1126e72b638e1f9511caa	I would do it without Delmon Young so with him yes. Santana usually has a weak April and then goes lights out after that. Your outfielders and other hitters will definitely cover you. Santana basically can help you win strikeouts, era and whip because of how deep in games he goes. The guy is an absolute stud.|`|XRzQzWGvaa	Yeah make the trade since it looks like you need a good pitcher.
0XBVbGRKaa	shaq is not going anywhere. he will end his career in Miami. what Dallas needs is dirk to grow a pair of testicles. the guy is as soft as a cupcake and should no longer be considered an elite player.<br>  <br>  elite players are able to put their teams on their back and will them to victory. did dirk do that ? no of course not, he complained and deferred to his LESSER teammates.<br>  <br>  until he can step up Dallas will always be a paper champion.|`|frxaOujLaa	I think Shaq would add to their problems.  I think they need to get a center with defensive presence, and utilize Dirk as a power forward...however in order to do that you also need a defensive minded 2 or 3 that can rebound if Dirk is taking outside shots.  <br>  <br>  Harris/ Terry/ Howard/ Nowitzki/ Diop isnt bad, but adding someone like Al Jefferson or Samuel Dalembert would put them over the top|`|XRzQzWGvaa	If Shaq came to Dallas then Dirk would be gone because there would be no way Miami would trade Shaq and not get a player of caliber like Dirk.  It would be a great lineup but it would seem impossible that this scenario would happen.|`|sfXTRJWcaa	like u said the mavs dont have a bench to win a championship u need to be a team with depth at every position.
bXqGa139aa	Yes, many. That is not as odd a combination as you might think. Sprinters and short to mid distance runners are often also weight lifters and due to the time spent running, they don’t usually weigh very much. One of the men I train with weighs 150-160 pounds and benches approx. 300 pounds and averages just under 7 min. in the 5Ks we run and slightly slower in 10K runs and he’s not what I would consider “avid” at either. A better question might be whether marathon runners or tri athletes that can bench press twice their weight. That percentage would be extremely low or non-existent.
DYltvTYWaa	John David Booty will win the Heisman.  <br>  <br>  People may disagree, but it comes down to a few basic "rules" about the heisman.  <br>  <br>  1) Need to be on a winning team.  This will rule out McFadden.  he may be the most tlaneted player, but the Razorbacks are in such chaos this year, that not even Ricky Williams in his prime would be able to salvage them.  USC is so stacked on both sides of the ball that they will most likely be in the NC game.<br>  <br>  2) Play in a big conference.  This works in McFaddens favor, but guys like Ian Johnson (who is a stud), and Colt Brennan (a passing machine), will get slightly overlooked becasue of the level of competition they play against.<br>  <br>  3) Need to play in the "Glamour Positions" ie. RB or QB<br>  <br>  so lets look at the winners since 1990:<br>  1990 Ty Detmer Brigham Young QB** (miss on rule 2)<br>  1991 Desmond Howard Michigan WR** (Miss on rule 3)<br>  1992 Gino Torretta Miami (Fla) QB <br>  1993 Charlie Ward Florida State QB <br>  1994 Rashaan Salaam Colorado RB<br>  1995 Eddie George Ohio State RB <br>  1996 Danny Wuerffel Florida QB <br>  1997 Charles Woodson Michigan CB ** (Miss on rule 3)<br>  1998 Ricky Williams Texas RB <br>  1999 Ron Dayne Wisconsin RB <br>  2000 Chris Weinke Florida State QB <br>  2001 Eric Crouch Nebraska QB <br>  2002 Carson Palmer USC QB<br>  2003 Jason White Oklahoma QB <br>  2004 Matt Leinart USC QB <br>  2005 Reggie Bush USC RB <br>  2006 Troy Smith Ohio State QB<br>  <br>  **So with 3 exceptions in the last 17 years, the "rules" apply, and those 3 really stood out.<br>  <br>  Finally, don't let emotions get in the way.  Henne is a good QB, but doesn't win the big games, and the voters will notice.  Hart is a beast of a running back, but if you look at the types of RB's that win, they are the shock and awe types of backs.  Hart is great, don't get me wrong, but he doesn't move like Bush, Dayne, Williams, or George, and they are the last 4 to win.<br>  <br>  John David Booty fills all the "rules" and will win the Heisman.|`|AA10399154	If a lineman could win this award than Jake Long of Michigan deserves it hands down. But, no one ever votes for linemans (or rarely does) so here's my reasoning with a quick rundown.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Mike Hart, RB (Michigan)<br>  <br>  Has the fewest fumbles by a starting runningback and is one of the biggest (No pun intended) targets on the team.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Chad Henne, QB (Michigan)<br>  <br>  Probably one of the best signalcallers in the NCAA and a very smart and quick player.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Darren McFadden, RB (Arkansas)<br>  <br>  A powerfull and explosive back who well be a first-round pick.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Brian brohm, QB (Louisville)<br>  <br>  Amazing athlete and has a good arm.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Colt Brenan, QB (Hawaii)<br>  <br>  Has the best stats in the NCAA but drawbacks are his weight, he's only 190-Lbs. but who cares?<br>  <br>  <br>  Most Heismans have been busts so, which one of these well break that record????|`|AA11433419	McFadden|`|4b1ceaa46aa120eb6b53d8602b81f757aa	The one who always get's overlooked, will be the first QB taken in next year's draft and would have been the first QB in this year's draft, and who has the best numbers of any QB in college football, is Brian Brohm of Louisville.|`|HpSZbQaoaa	Mcfadden... logical pick<br>  <br>  I say Colt Brennan if he has anything near the year he had last year (he does not need to break his own records) then I could definitely see him winning it with a solid team in the WAC with weak opponents and Boise St not as strong.|`|ad8ae0beb2658b0fc1163597e0dbaf4faa	Darren McFadden is an early pick to win but if Boise State can do well again this year behind Ian Johnson then Johnson has a good shot at it|`|bXqGa139aa	This season’s got a few early choices, as the same names come up. Ill offer a player to watch for 2008 or 2009. Colt McCoy at Texas. This kid is so skilled and so young. I follow quarterbacks more than the other positions, and this kid has got game. His athleticism will continue to improve, but his understanding of the game and his leadership is already as good or better than the names thrown out a 2007 candidates.|`|AA10165212	Ian Johnson!

Each team has adapted to the Sabres. The Rangers learned from the Islanders and the Senators learned from them both. Now Ottawa which has a better team than either of the NY teams can used that info, their superior players and a little bit of the trap to shut them down. Its so disappointing, they were so great this year but ultimately they are going to really let down the city of Buffalo and its surronding areas. I cant believe its happening.|`|AA10789965	time will tell..laugh now..cry later..|`|AA11674745	I think it's the overwhelming fumes from the polish they use on the President's Trophy.

All the while Emery is melting and the commentators are claiming it is due to the lack of action infront of the Ottawa net early in the series and suddenly we're in game 7 and the third OT and Ottawa is generating chance after chance around the Buffalo net but not putting the puck past Miller when a hard shot caroms off the end boards resulting in a 2-1 for Buffalo who scores on their first shot of OT.
AA10789965	i agree..one game at a time..|`|DfHFMEfraa	I say both, Ottawa seems to have gotten off their game, and Buffalo is playing desperate, I think Ottawa will get back to basics next game and get down to business and eliminate the Sabre's.<br>  <br>  The same thing happened last year, Buffalo was up 3-0 and Ottawa took game 4 because they were desperate.  But you cant play 4 straight games desperate, its like trying to sprint a marathon...|`|sjv1kCvLaa	Always believing but, they are playing alot better now!  It may be too late but dont stop believing!  I think Ottawa got too comfortable!<br>  <br>  If the Sabres win tonight Sabres fan please dont litter the board talking crap we have a long way to go against an excellent team!

UoJZnZbKaa	I play second base for my high school team and while my glove is a little over $100 it is made by Mizuno...any Mizuno infield glove i have found is great.  They have nice pockets, easy to break in (i do it without the oil.)  They have gloves that are under $100 that are great for second base as well.  But anything you can find that is about 11 inches or so would be suitable for second base.|`|OBwMIVwhaa	There isn't a specific glove for second base. Catchers and first baseman have specific gloves. You don't want to get one that's too big. Anything over 13 in. would be over kill for that position. I use a 13 in. Louisville TPS. Infield gloves are generally smaller than those used in the outfield. I recommend something 13in or smaller. Louisville makes a great glove!|`|bc5526f5d78a19c2314d3fe83f783455aa	Just go to walmart and buy a glove for about $20.  Who cares what it looks like..its all doing the same thing (catching the ball).|`|PqcxdR3Vaa	I play second base for my school's JV Team. I recomend the Mizuno Ballpark Series.

7oZ6Z57qaa	No offense, but that first answer isn't all that good.  As a goalie and coach, I can tell you that the best corner kicks are driven, not too high--around the waist.  Aim for the PK spot if it's an inswinging kick, or just outside the PK spot if its an outswinging kick.  That will draw the Keeper out of position because it's tough to judge a ball that's traveling away from you.  Another good one is knee high and hard to the near post, but you have to have guys running on to it.  This works best if the opposition has their keeper playing back towards the far post and has a lot of traffic out front, or if the GK plays agressive in going to get kicks that are put in the middle.  <br>  <br>  The most important thing is to drive it into the box.  If it's got any air under it a good keeper will gobble it up.   Plus most teams have their tallest players as defenders, making it tough to win headballs for forwards.|`|428af0611017082721b89716252c273aaa	hahaha|`|AeFrpwZkaa	Aim for the line of the goalie box and make sure to kick the ball high and try to curve it towards the goal.

However the commish should put it to a vote to see what the rest of the league does.  <br>  <br>  I personally dont think that it should be changed midseason because u joined the league under  certain circumstances and now to change it undermines it.

I was in a league where the commish took off the veto but for good reason. There was a group who were vetoing all trades but their own, just to be doing it.  If he is doing it for that reason I can see why. Trades can seem fair to some and not fair to others. Unless it is a superstar for a benchwarmer, that's just the way it goes. If someone is helping someone else win, it's wrong but you can't do anything about it except quit playing or try to win.|`|MOl7cIAGaa	They shouldn't be able to do that if you are able to vote on the website.  You need to get out of that league.  The commish and his friends are just trying to take advantage of the rest of the league.  My friend is in a league where the commish gave himself the first pick in the draft since he organized the league.
oWvvH83aaa	Offside<br>  <br>  <br>  There is in ice hockey, as in many other sports, a rule called offside.<br>  <br>  A player is offside if:<br>  <br>  - The player receives the puck from behind the opposing blue line, while being in front of the blue line.<br>  <br>  It is worth noting that the players stick may be across the blue line, and they can still receive the puck, as long as both their skates are behind the blue line.<br>  <br>  - The player is behind the blue line on the opponents side of the rink, and a member of the same team brings the puck over that line into the opponents zone.<br>  <br>  - The player is standing in the opponents end of the rink, with both skates over the centre red line, and receives a puck that has been passed from behind that players own blue line.<br>  <br>  The player can only enter a zone if the puck is in front of them, or they are in control of the puck.<br>  <br>  An offside decision can be invalidated if:<br>  <br>  - The defending team passes or carries the puck into the neutral zone.<br>  <br>  - All attacking players in that zone for the offside, leave that zone.<br>  <br>  As with most sports, there is a difference between being offside and being in an offside position. As long as a player does not take part in the game, by receiving the puck or interfering with play until they are in an on-side position, the offside penalties do not apply.<br>  <br>  After an offside decision, play is restarted by a face-off on one of the face-off spots or circles closest to the offending teams attacking zone.|`|SPCyHAFLaa	Offsides is when the player with the puck is the first player to cross the opponents blue line except for break away situations.|`|HuLfkeJeaa	Player crossing the offensive blue line prior to the puck.|`|MOl7cIAGaa	The player crosses the blue line before the puck does.|`|MoNoYVj8aa	Offsides happen when an offensive player moves into the offensive zone (crosses the blue line) before the puck is in the zone. By rule, the puck must precede any offensive player in crossing the blue line, or offsides is called, and there is a face off in the opposite end of the rink.|`|g4W9StYKaa	A player is over the blue line before the pucks crosses.  However they have to be completely over the blueline.  Many players leave a skate on the other side of the blueline until the puck crosses, and that is legal.  Also if you do not leave the zone when the puck crosses back over the blueline you are offsides, however, then you have the chance to "tag up"...which means if it re-enters the zone, you stay away from the puck and get to the other side of the blueline and then back again.

He may have been able to get a true running back and tight end either in a trade or off of the fantasy waiver wires but still needed wide receiver help that he didn't have to give anything up for.|`|9edf5d40c71316153bd15164c8e8f7a4aa	do you have a man crush on Fuston? how many times / ways are you going to ask this question?|`|MOl7cIAGaa	I don't think it would be fair to switch in the middle of the season.  Most website did have him as a WR.  Yahoo's league you can use him as a WR or TE.  Once a player is drafted (Colston probably wasn't) or picked up you can't change his position.|`|an6avVWiaa	I don't know what if anything Colston being listed as a TE last year has to do with Brandon Funston.  However, Yahoo! NEVER changes the position eligibility of players midseason, it wouldn't be fair to those who drafted him thinking he could play TE.  He wont be eligible at the TE spot this year, and the guy that had him in my main league last year came in 7th...

3oHTV9Mtaa	better go for hits  because most big tourneys have homerun limits these days.|`|AE6rBMUQaa	Base hits are definitely the best. Long-balls could just lead to a long out.

Load up those bases, and with zero or one out, then go for the big shots. It makes no sense to waste base runs, so if you find yourself with runners on and two outs, play it safe - go for the base hits. Good luck.|`|n6lhLSSaaa	i would say base hits!

Kobe is a great player that alienates his teammates.<br>  <br>  LeBron has been criticized for not having Kobe's killer instinct, but SOMEONE from the Cavs always steps up out of nowhere and wins the game (Hughes in Washington, Marshall in NJ and Gibson/Gooden last night) because LeBron is basketball smart and finds the hot hand.<br>  <br>  Tim Duncan is the "Big Fundamental" for a reason...incredibly efficient, doesn't get too emotional...no wasted steps...uses the glass...outstanding passer for a big man...also basketball brilliant.<br>  <br>  Basketball is a team sport.

I don't think either Nash or Nowitzki (sp?) deserved the MVP awards, especially considering Dirk's pathetic first round this year.  The Suns and Mavs would have reached the playoffs without Dirk and Nash.  LeBron, though, doesn't deserve it in my eyes yet, either.  I would argue for Kobe or Tim Duncan - probably Tim Duncan because he's such a good guy and should be the face of the NBA, and he brings it every night in every way.  LeBron needs to develop the clutch ability and the multi-faceted game to deserve the MVP award, and he doesn't have either yet, honestly.|`|znQ4RmLJaa	duncan

f3fe43fa9748930356995dd131ca37fdaa	According to the help page of yahoo fantasy football, it will go live on Monday, June 4. However, it does not say what exact time.|`|MOl7cIAGaa	Registration starts next week.  They didn't say the exact date so I'm guessing Sunday or Monday.|`|VF7gWWZ4aa	According to Yahoo!, sometime this summer.  I would guess Early to mid July is when the leagues will open.
M8nkfdcyaa	No, but Lebron is THAT good. Im not a fan of the Cavs, or of Lebron. But what i saw last night was just ridiculous.|`|0CnW95saaa	I'm a Cavs fan...so in a way I hope that Detroit isn't overrated otherwise it brings down the series a lot.<br>  <br>  This Detroit team has been fabulous for 5 years...with at least one ring to prove it.<br>  <br>  Sheed is a worthy adversary with a warrior/poets heart.  He wears his emotions on his sleeve.  When he's focused, he can be deadly....or a timebomb.<br>  <br>  Billups and Rip?  Multi-time all-star pair.<br>  <br>  Tayshawn has to have the biggest wingspan I've ever seen for his size.  He's sort of a freak, but also a great compliment defensively.<br>  <br>  Webber, to me, is sort of a shell of what he used to be... but that doesn't detract from the fact he is a smart and experienced ball player.<br>  <br>  Overrated?  No...losing a step?  maybe...deep and experienced?  no question...worthy adversaries?  no question.<br>  <br>  Again, I'm a Cavs fan and I'm still stinging from being ahead 3-2 LAST year and losing.  It could happen again and invalidate game 5.  I just hope that doesn't happen.<br>  <br>  The Cavs will win at home in game 6.|`|HIfs0vgzaa	not really....i'm not a fan of the pistons and sometimes pissed off at them because of their attitude but let's face it....the pistons are doing great and here's why they are being rated as they are right now:<br>  <br>  > they have good chemistry and balance....<br>  <br>  > they know how to win even in the playoffs....<br>  <br>  > they are experienced and have won titles before....<br>  <br>  > billups does great in the clutch and it's amazing to see hamilton always running around the court and getting open looks....<br>  <br>  > t-prince role playing is really great....he brings what's needed from him by the team....<br>  <br>  >plus the addtion of webber gives them more passing and spacing in the court....<br>  <br>  the pistons do great and the GM did a good job on putting the right pieces together....but they already had their rings....it's more interesting to see the lebron and the cavs try and get theirs....<br>  <br>  oh and by the way, game 5 was awesome....what a game!|`|AA10753308	Yes they are overrated! All this hype on them how great they are..blah blah... Cavs have proved in double overtime that they are better. Beating a team at their home court is sweet!!|`|Fjz9rGyraa	Absolutely not! This is a great team with great players that has made it to the Eastern Conference Finals in the last 5 years, 2 NBA finals and 1 championship. The fact they're down 3 to 2 against Cleveland doesn not mean that they aren't a great team anymore. They were in the same situation last year and they yet pass Cleveland. Lebron is in a momentum right now and he's playing the best basketball of his career, but he will have to play the same way on Saturday in order to beat the Pistons which I don't think it will happen based on past performances. I cannot give him the credit yet of being a clutch player for just being clutch in the last two games. How about all the other ones that he came up short? The bottom line is that the Detroit Pistons have the heart of a champion and I'm sure that Lebron does too, but does the rest of the team has it? I don't think so.|`|wgMXtO5aaa	No, but they are getting older, and Cavs are young and<br>  gaining exprience.|`|sdFPPCQhaa	Absolutely not.  This is something called KARMA.  The talked junk on The King and said he was overrated, and last night he made them look silly.  This is what happens when you have great chemestry in the locker room, it's called a TEAM, and it's a TEAM with that so called "hunger".  What a great player Labron is and team leader.  I'm glad he's at where he's at!!!!

SJ0tzbyGaa	Westbrook, Smith, Johnson, and Rivers. All studs.|`|1850e321d748d4e098c92c3678c6378faa	Westbrook always looks good until he gets hurt. Steve Smith is money, but is undersized and tends to get banged up along the way also. Defenses are on to him and without someone on the other side, he'll have trouble producing solid numbers again. Johnson has done well so far for someone without a QB. He is also a guy who needs more help from his supporting cast and could take a step back if he isn't "tuned in" with the new QB. Jacobs and Lewis are guys that have potential for a bunch of goalline carries(especially Jacobs) but neither are "elite" RB's.<br>    Rivers seems like the safest pick at keeper. Depending on what you get with QB's . He also has the best skilled position players around him, and there is also no one behind him vying for reps.|`|zYsTUIL6aa	Steve Smith as long as you have confidence in Carolina's QB.  I had Delhomme last year and he was awful.  Brandon Jacobs is good especially for touchdowns and he'll get more carries with Tiki Barber retired.  Philip Rivers because he has Gates and LT.  It almost doesn't matter who the WR's are.  Lewis is over the hill and Cleveland never scores rushing TD's so not him.  I would pick Johnson over Westbrook due purely to durability issues.  Westbrook seems to have nagging injuries while Johnson have been a primary target and comes through year after year despite being Houston's only offensive option.|`|AA11323589	westbrook<br>  smith<br>  rivers<br>  jacobs|`|DFMcDa6Kaa	B. Westbrook (he is a beast)<br>  P. Rivers ( great numbers)<br>  A. Johnson (jump on the A train)<br>  S.

3OduDersaa	3 REASONS<br>  BROKEN NOSE/CHEEK BONE<br>  LUCK<br>  AND HE SAYS IT IS HIS CHARACTER NOW|`|0CnW95saaa	Not true.<br>  <br>  In reality he caught an elbow to the face and nursed a cracked cheekbone for a long while.<br>  <br>  There was something about nose cartilage...probably did break it, but I think the whole-face mask was because of the cheekbone.<br>  <br>  Imagine how a broken nose and cracked cheekbone feels...so he wore the mask as it healed.  During that time, he felt he was more focused during games and hasn't taken it off since.   Now it's sort of a good luck item.|`|AA11791796	In order to prevent his nose from being broken and/or protect his face from further injury as well.|`|Cwwaf0M3aa	because he broke his nose a while ago and he is trying to prevent it from happening again.|`|G2wq2Degaa	He did break his nose twice I believe.  And if you break your nose too many times, you won't have any more cartilage left in it.<br>  <br>  He originally started wearing a mask so he could come back early from his broken nose injury and play ball.  But now, he wears it more out of comfort.  In interviews, he has said he likes wearing it.<br>  <br>  "After fracturing his nose three times in the 2003-04 season, Hamilton began wearing a protective mask in the 2004 NBA Playoffs. He has continued to wear the mask, reportedly because three reconstructive surgeries have left him without nose cartilage and vulnerable to a career-ending injury. He also told ESPN reporters that he wears the mask for good luck."|`|UUHgf72naa	He fractured his nose before.  He played well with it on, so he kept it.|`|a68a2e85228bdd68fab827e81e6c5b53aa	he is afraid to show his ugly face|`|c035931dd7ab5a1f6e7202d0f0f80dbaaa	because he broke his nose years ago|`|hoWpd6I6aa	he broke his nose so many timess|`|kXktOK1taa	He originally wore it because his nose was not ready to even have slight contact but his reasoning for wearing it now is not because of the off chance of it breaking or because his nose is to weak, it is because of his superstitions which is what he said on espn when he continued to wear the mask months after it was to be fully healed.|`|mx18hOPcaa	hes broken his nose so many times that its really fragile and it protects it in case he gets hit... its solid molded so its rigid|`|zmwKZNygaa	He broke his nose in 04 and since they won a title that year he feels it is lucky

Or a nice dip of SKOAL if that's more your style.
0CnW95saaa	The most important point about a shooting stroke is that it is repeatable.<br>  <br>  Some people tell you to just use your stroke and not worry about mechanics...I don't agree.<br>  <br>  Every jumpshot that Reggie Miller took was the exact same in length, quickness and arc.<br>  <br>  If you can repeat a stroke over and over again, it becomes easier to 'feel' when your stroke is off and becomes easier to mechanically fix it.<br>  <br>  A good way to start is to shoot one handed free throws.  It forces you to keep your elbow in front of you.  Remeber that the other hand is only there as a guide.  If your shot is good and repeateable, you actually don't need the second hand.<br>  <br>  Lastly, let it roll naturally off your hands.  Don't try to adjust a forward or side spin.  If it rolls of your hands nicely, it will create the perfect back spin that takes all the 'weight' off a shot no matter how long you shoot it.<br>  <br>  Ever notice how some guys fire off a 3 and it bounces on the rim 3 or 4 times?  Soft touch = good backspin on their shot.<br>  <br>  Other guys hit the rim and it bounces 15 feet in any random direction...not so soft touch.<br>  <br>  Also...if you start to miss the same way all the time..THAT'S A GOOD THING...that means you are developing a shot and have a mechanical problem that causes the same issue all the time.  THAT is a bonus to using a repeatable shot.<br>  <br>  If it's always to the left...or always on the front rim...those are fixable things.<br>  <br>  If you're like Shaq and any one of 50 things can happen during your shot...it's not fixable.<br>  <br>  When you get to the point where you can actually shoot free throws one-handed and get it to bounce on the rim 2 or 3 times the exact same way ON PURPOSE...then you have a repeateable shot that you can rely upon.|`|fKlZdoPHaa	dont worry about any stance or position. just do in the most comfortable manner. start closer to the basket, make a lots of them, and move one step away, make tons of shots, then move one step away, shoot, keep doing it . keep shooting as much as u can. and keep yourself hydrated!|`|29449a8f40a90c057a20613f1839409aaa	keep ur elbow tucked him, keep ur eyes on the basket, and when u shoot, follow through|`|3BSmDGGvaa	Its a mental block. you can teach the mechnic and the form all you want when you come down to it.

4MjHzR1Zaa	Spencer Hawes suits best with Pistons' passing game, but it needs a quite a bit of lucks to see him falling to #14. He may not be the best defender, but offensively, he can knock out 15- to 20-foot J's and 3-pointers. (Brad Miller in the making?). If he isn't available, I suppose Pistons can settle with Jason Smith. At any rate, a big man is a must. For pick #25, I expect Pistons to take a combo of F-G, who can cover both Rip and Tay. Delfino is a rather disappointment I think this year, escpecially on the defensive end, and I am not so certain how much he can improve. Marcus Williams or Alando Tucker.|`|5rdThwYpaa	I f he is there, I really like Nick Young out of USC,good hands, good defender, can create his own shot. The Pistons need size, but I think he would be too good to pass up.|`|Ldva4fwCaa	With the 14th pick, they will probably draft a big man such as Aaron Gray from Pitt or Jason Smith from CSU. I think that Smith goes more with their offense, a good shooter who can gather up some boards. I don't think that they really need a post presence now that they have Webber, their offense doesn't really call for it. The problem with both Gray and Smith is that they're not very good defenders, and that's one of the biggest things that the Pistons pride themselves on. Either of the two would be a good pick. I think Jason Smith has better potential for the NBA.|`|YZpSZZVAaa	I was also hoping for Gray, I think he'd be a great fit and ultimately help to fit the void that Wallace left.  Webber obviously won't be a long term fix and now that Sheed may be gone too, there'll be a real need for a big man.  Let's just hope that Joakim Noah doesn't fall that low!<br>  <br>  Have you been to Rootzoo..com yet?

RXJzJNqfaa	Nuca reparie isso ?, mas a arbitragem erra sempre a favor dos times d maiores repulta?oes, times caricacas e paulistas principalmente contra times mineiros e gauchos. Em quanto as federa?oes de arbitragem ? derem conta de seus trabalhos e ? punir arbitros por repeti?oes de erros ou por falta de preparo fisico vai ser sempre assim. Lembrando q o inter foi roubado no Brasileiro daquela confusao toda e quem foi punido?

Se vc observar bem estamos passando no "sufoco", pois, por pouco ou por um penalti<br>  que o juiz praticamente "facilitou" para nossa sele??o estamos na final.

O Brasil pode perder posi??es importantes<br>  no ranking da fifa se continuar assim. O Dunga deve abrir o olho para essa sele??o e chamar jogadores melhores.<br>  Por exemplo esse goleiro Doni n?o me tem  convencido em nada e essa defesa n?o consegue marcar ninguém.<br>  <br>  Mas n?o vamos deixar de ser torcedores fiéis brasileiros né kasandra e vamos torcer para a vitória sobre a <br>  "toda poderosa" Argentina!

zu0J4V4Qaa	Richard Cohen !<br>  Cohen fue cinco veces campeón nacional de esgrima de Inglaterra y miembro del equipo olímpico británico en cuatro oportunidades.Pero su pasión por el arte de la espada corre pareja a la que profesa por el mundo del libro. Ha sido director editorial de Hutchinson y Holdder & Stoughton hasta que acabó fundando su propia casa editora, Richard Cohen Books. A los 56 a?os, el editor continúa entrenando al sable dos veces a la semana y compite, con cierto éxito, en esporádicos torneos para veteranos. ?Pero cuando combato con un joven, se frota las manso saboreando por anticipado la victoria?, reconoce el autor.<br>  <br>  Blandir la espada es una amena y erudita historia de la esgrima desde que la espada hizo su a parición en el a?o 1500 a.C. hasta los actuales campeones olímpico. Este largo recorrido da cabida, por supuesto, a los hitos memorables del arte de la espada, desde los orígenes de la práctica disciplinada en el antiguo Egipto, pasando por los gladiadores romanos, los mosqueteros y el rito sagrado de los samuráis hasta los célebres espadachines de celuloide.No se echan de menos las grandes figuras míticas o reales que dedicaron su vida a la espada, ni tampoco las curiosidades históricas, como el día en que Hitler se debatió en duelo con un campeón judío durante los juegos olímpicos de 1936 o la fascinante historia del equipo de esgrima húngaro que escapó de los nazis por milagro.Sin embargo, Blandir la espada se puede leer también como una historia social, o de las costumbres, alternativa a través del prisma de la espada. ?Al final de la redacción de la obra me di cuenta que desarrollaba un tema alternativo: cómo distintas personas en diferentes épocas y culturas habían tratado la cuestión del honor tanto en la esfera pública como la privada?, explica Cohen, que despliega similar destreza en el manejo de la pluma que del florete. Su estilo es elegante y preciso como un esgrimista en acción.<br>  <br>  Al preguntarle por el mejor espadachín de todos los tiempos, Cohen se emociona y titubea: ?Seguramente fue Rolando pero no tenemos información fiable. El mejor que yo he visto en acción es el polaco Jerzy Pawlowski?, asegura el escritor que ha entrenado a estrellas como Madonna para las escenas de esgrima de la serie James Bond, Die another day. ?Mi entrenador de los a?os 50 había entrenado a Errol Flynn. El me invitó a participar en la película, Y ahí comenzó mi relación íntima con Madonna ?, bromea Cohen.|`|TnhlVaQ7aa	De que país sos!!!??? Como queres que te demos consejos si ni siquieras sabemos si vivís en México , Uruguay o Cucamonga!!!!<br>  Acaso no se te ocurrió eso al escribir la pregunta.<br>  Si sos de Argentina , dirigite al Club Gimnasia y Esgrima<br>  Y si no, meteteen el buscador que se encuentra arriba de todo en la pagina que estas leyendo y pone "esgrima asociaciones clubes historia campeones" y después clickeas el icono " buscar en la Web" y entonces si, si no encontras nada ( lo dudo) podes volver a hacer la pregunta acá, mientras tanto no nos hagas perdes el tiempo!!<br>  Ta claro?

ysbjYfKYaa	10 being best, I would rate this draft about a 6.5.  WR are solid but you should not count on Berrian b/c of his QB.  Also, Portis is overrated w/ Betts coming in, and your QB are not big time point scorers-in fantasy terms.  Defense solid, kickers good, RB are injury-prone and kickers are good.|`|Sw3sgcEQaa	its ok. not as good as one of the two i have. if want another chance join this league also<br>  <br>  hey if you want to play go to yahoo sports then fantasy football. join a league and here is the information you will need<br>  <br>  <br>  room is called patriots fans<br>  id number is 44173<br>  password is comeonin<br>  <br>  or come on in with no spaces.thanks.everyone plz i have the maximum number of teams at 20 so fell free to join. the draft will be saturday june 16. at 7:45 eastern time. if you want to play you will get all that information when you join. everyone is welcome.|`|TVoNS0zwaa	horrible choice for QB, vince is losing his best teammates so he is going to suck this year... other than that it looks pretty good|`|nceGH7mMaa	Not too bad, you might want to check the match-ups for your QB's for the first few weeks until one emerges from the pack, but not bad. Watch the injuries for your running backs, I would drop a receiver and get a more stable back-up or at least trade for one.|`|xRE2xFaSaa	Not bad, but you need depth at RB.  Taylor was healthy all last year, so odds are he'll go down this year.  Trade him in the first couple weeks while you can get some value for him!<br>  Good thing you grabbed Romo, too, in case Young struggles.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	Your WR corp is gonna keep you from contending.

75fGnRzWaa	The 90s Cowboys may end up with more Hall of Famers on one unit than any other offensive unit, so I'd put them up there.  They had the great trio of Aikman, Emmitt, and Irvin, and they also had a terrific tight end in Novacek and a good fullback in Moose Johnston.  And their O-Line is one of the all time greats with Allen, Newton, Tuinei, etc.  They put up over 100 points (with the help of the Bills' offense--another all time great offense, by the way) in back to back Super Bowls.  The other offenses you mentioned were definitely great, but all were pass first offenses, whereas the Cowboys had much more balance and could just line up and play "smash mouth" if they had to.|`|2jrCeEVUaa	all very good ones and heres another<br>  Warren Moon, Drew Hill, Ernest Givins, Haywood Jeffires, and Lorenzo White|`|68f1085a2e6212e8ade4276e46e44b50aa	steelers of the 70's with 4 hall of famers.....Bradshaw,Franco Harris,Lynn swann,john stallworth,.....and rocky blier to boot!|`|9c9bbbc4431418bb2896eaeb7f594d18aa	It's the niners man.

Emmitt Smith... and that big mouth reciever?, ... the moose...their are a bunch more, can't recall I'm not a Cowboy fan!|`|CnBp4FxOaa	I say the '99 Rams. They had huge numbers and won a ring. They put up the best numbers while winning the SuperBowl. The 84 Dolphins are #2,because they had the 2nd greatest success and numbers.<br>  Combining winning and numbers, 1st is the Warner led Rams and 2nd is the Marino led 'phins. All others that put up better numbers did not win the ring or consistently threaten to!! Singling out the single years of 84 ('phins) and 99 (Rams).|`|M4GDh560aa	Gotta go with the Vikes. Moss and Carter were primetime receiver, Cunningham was a Micheal Vick that could throw and Smith was a solid back.|`|SbE0yOhIaa	Marino, Duper and Clayton. By a landslide.|`|pzRXINWTaa	the colts tthe year peyton broke the record|`|q75AjQ52aa	I agree with mojo, Steelers of the 70's.|`|so5F4sixaa	definitely (Terry Bradshaw,Franco Harris,Lynn Swann, and John Stallworth)|`|Ar54Tylsaa	The Rams' Greatest Show on Turf offense from 1999-2001 - Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk, Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt, Az-Zahir Hakim, and Ricky Proehl were the big names on that offense.|`|70d3ccf4f58fa9385ff69c54074252b3aa	THE GREATEST SHOW ON TURF!!!!!!!!!!!! Rams 99-01. Deffinatly!|`|ewQ0mLxsaa	Montana, Craig, Rice, Taylor.. lol maybe or Cunningham Smith, Moss ,n Carter...thats just my oppinion|`|jpWtZUEqaa	For now I am going with Montana/ Rice 49ers but in about 10 years it maybe Manning/ Harrison Colts.|`|q5IYgHmOaa	The '98 Vikes put up the best numbers ever so you gotta say theyre the best. Anyone who gives me any b.s. about an easy schedule is dumb. They were the most talented offense ever and showed it. And anyone who says that the Rams were better... well youre partially right. But only on a consistency basis. Even though the '98 Vikes only had 1 unbelievable year, it was still statistically better than any Rams year.
MOl7cIAGaa	That's a tough call.  Can you wait until you see some preseason games?  With the new coaches you never know how they are going to do.  I think Atlanta is going to run the ball more with Norwood.  Parcels liked Barber more than Jones but the new coach might not.|`|75fGnRzWaa	Keep Dunn as he's still the workhorse in ATL, while Jones splits time and doesn't get the carries around the goal line.  Of course, both have new coaches, so you never know if they are going to have the same philosophies as their predecessors.|`|MYcSX8Hraa	I would drop Dunn.  I do not see Atlanta being a very strong team this year.  They may be forced to run more due to all the trouble Vick may be in and his back up gone, but other teams will know that and stop the run.  I think that Jones is on a very good, well rounded cowboys team and I see him thriving much more.|`|dZWEqBZBaa	Drop Dunn.  Jones was promised more touches earlier in the offseason.  Dunn has Jerius Noorwood creeping up on him real quick
MUvZ5CAtaa	Yeah the tuck rule sucks, but I hate both those teams, so... oh well.|`|cdQryr7paa	I don't care what the "tuck rule" says, that was a fumble.<br>  Just another reason ........................<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  THE PATRIOTS SHOULD CRASH AND BURN!!!|`|6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	I am against the tuck rule since it pretty much says that it is a forward pass attempt, but is not counted in the statistical analysis.  Furthermore, since the QB is not on the ground nor did the ground cause the QB to lose control of the football, it should be a ruled a fumble.  This rule may have been in the books, but it was not even brought up until the famous tuck rule incident.  It isn't fair that all of the other games previous to that never made a case for that rule and does add to the conspracist's theory of how the NFL began the push for the Patriots.<br>  <br>  Personally, the rule is a cop-out for the QB if a good defense gets the better of him and pours pressure on him during a game.  If the QB loses the ball in any way, regardless of forward motion of the throwing arm, it is the QB's fault for lack of protection and should be ruled a fumble against the offense.|`|CS0y6rYFaa	im against the tuck rule cuz the raiders should have won and maibe if the raiders would have won they would have been better from 04 to 06|`|MOl7cIAGaa	That was a fumble.  The tuck rule needs modified.|`|zVyWLaU9aa	I think it's a nice rule to have in the NFL guidelines.  There are a lot of calls out there that just don't make sense and seem to favor some teams at times but I believe this one is just one of those rules thats pretty clear cut, theres not getting around it like some fumbles and incomplete passes.|`|CtA8ShX7aa	I think all those gay rules should be taken out. They are taking away from the game of football. Like how much the quarterback is protected, so people cant use there helmets when they hit them. What is that? Or the cant hit an unprotected recievier rule. The game of football should go back to the way it was back in the good oll days|`|KgejZSasaa	boooooo to the tuck rule boooooooo|`|UZu7qkVdaa	i dont see any reason they should keep it around|`|ufDkz4KXaa	The rule was in place before that game it was just little known and seldom called... I am for the rule because they have been consistent in calling it since that game and as long as it doesnt favor one side. Each team has the chance to be hindered or helped by it so it is a fair rule.|`|zlTTH4V2aa	the tuck rule was setup to stop the turnovers by qb it is a rule that if it want there every1 would say they need to have a tuck rule
9xeFu2gwaa	This is easy: Sebastian Telfair.<br>  <br>  Who else could leverage mediocre talent, a suspect legal history, below average height, and no track record of success into a multi-million dollar career?<br>  <br>  He is truly a "player."|`|AA10215715	steve nash 2 time mvp<br>  <br>  <br>  go SUNS!|`|AA11669050	That's tough to answer, you can go by the stats, but how did they receive those numbers. All players are great just the ones who can finish the play gets the top numbers.|`|M0rjeC5naa	I would have to say Tony Parker. After watching the playoffs, he tore through every defense that was put against him. he shredded every team they faced. It was just sick. The way he torched cleveland is enough merit for him. I mean he did get finals MVP.

jusF0hcVaa	is worth 50￠ because if is not signed by him is worth nothing.|`|zNedebAlaa	It is priceless! I would hold on to it and never let it go, actually I would stop going outside for fear of it being taken, hide in a cave and covet it and call it "My Precious" and wait till someone gives you an offer yo ucan't refuse, but be afraid, you might not be able to part with it, it could become too precious and you will have to end up killing the person who offered it. You will be in a huge mess then, in all honesty burn it now, trust me it is worth it. I'm sorry I couldn't stop myself. It really isn't significant unless it is signed or a rookie or a rare card. If you can find a card shop anymore I think there are still publications which have the prices for every card. Good luck.
zNedebAlaa	I think they are set on Wilson Chandler, SF from DePaul, and when the Knicks are set they seem to stay put with Their pick. They also seem to reach a lot, Chandler is supposed to be a second rounder but we'll see. Last year they stretched with Balkman, but he turned out OK. It seems like the Knicks have been drafting well so they should do pretty good. Good Luck, and can't wait till Thursday!|`|YKDhstvkaa	your mother|`|WXpPZDRmaa	they aint gonna get anyone bro

That was apparent when the Reds took 6 out of 7 this year from their weak rotation.  Keep Smoltz, Hud, James, and clean up the back end of the rotation.  Some free agent possibilities are Bartolo Colon, Livan Hernandez, Kenny Rogers, Curt Schilling, Kyle Lohse....there are a few more out there but most are basically 4-5 guys.<br>  <br>  GO REDS!!
RmHbNjtlaa	depends on what position, but just to be safe i say get an 11 or 12 inch glove.|`|PqcxdR3Vaa	12 inches, positive.|`|ZCNEm9hTaa	Outfielders need 12 - 12? inch gloves with deeper pockets <br>  <br>  Infielders need smaller gloves (10? - 11? inch) with shallower pockets for better control and quicker ball transfer <br>  <br>  Pitchers can go with a slightly larger than infielders but still need a small enough glove for fielding and throwing quickly
3i4Zkyjhaa	I'll give it a 6. (Only use 1 QB and 2 RB, BTW.)<br>  <br>  Look at Donovan McNabb the past 2 years.l He hasn't played a full season. I would probably drop Eli and pick up someone else. (J.P. Lossman's my sleeper.) RBs aren't bad. Gore is a solid choice, and Juslius is not that bad. VERY Solid WRs. When someone have Calvin Johnson as there 3rd String, then you know they'll do good. TE is good, a lot of speed in Vernon. K is alright, but don't worry, they don't usually get a lot of points. DEF is good. Ravens, I think, are either the 1st or 2nd rated DEF.|`|4BQWk2hYaa	i dont know what the hell the other people are thinkin but i think that your team will do quite well.  the other people are dumb *** shits.  they will be suckin  elis weinner win you win thank and i out ill be in the shits.  i give you a 8.5 because of the defense.|`|XZUW7mIeaa	8.5|`|adubadCRaa	7|`|mvu0yrF8aa	6.5|`|b48f2f2c3c698450e4a6f517fc498969aa	6. The best move you made was handcuffing the DAL rb's. DMac injury concerns, F.Gore injury concerns, Galloway Injury concerns, S. Smith offensive run oriented approach this year, C. Johnson rookie, V. Davis good pick if he stays healthy, and you probably took Bal. defense too early.  If everyone stays healthy and Johnson and Davis have breakout years you could have a very good year, but that's a big 'if'.
l9v9I6z2aa	It's really hard to say, but could it just be cramps?  2 gallons of water a day almost sounds like too much.  Either way, I don't think that sounds particularly normal.|`|n6HY8P3aaa	ask a doctor or physician.|`|PqcxdR3Vaa	you might be building stomach muscles which is why it hurts but it is only temporary.|`|QKofcVXCaa	You can strain your stomach muscles. If you do and continue your everday routine for practice then your not allowing it time to heal. Drinking that much water too is also not good for you. About 6 8oz glasses a day is enough. If you need to drink during practice then I suggest you a) drink small amounts slowly or b) swish it in your mouth like mouthwash and spit. Also don't eat heavy about 2 hrs before practice. I find a Milkyway or Snickers is enough till I get home from practice. Eating heavy and drinking excessive amounts of water can also be the cause of your stomach problems from practice.|`|eCJvbzdPaa	u probally f up ur stomach when u dive for balls|`|zcpdD9oiaa	Pending on how long you have been playing ball and if you are still in good shape or not and pending how long you have been exercising and if you havent been then , yes your stomach will be sore and evently it will get better all you are doing is just excising muscle in your stomach that you didnt think you had ,just take some time off and let the muscle relax a little and then go at it again

RIsNmubSaa	The thing that annoys me is Orton played more consistently the 15 games he played when Rex was out two seasons ago and the Chicago fans wanted his head on a platter. But Rex can do no wrong.  He is weak and they should admit it.<br>  <br>  Also, you can not compare Rex's first full season to Manning's first full season. Manning's first full season was as a TRUE rookie and with no defense, Rex had 8 NFL games under his belt, 3 years of practicing with an NFL team, and a better defense.  I understand he had injuries keeping him down, but it's a weak argument, please stop making it.|`|4cehW3S9aa	That was very well put.  Grossmann is bad, inconsistent, and he looks like a middle school boy going through puberty.<br>  <br>  Young or not, he is never going to make  a name for himself in the NFL.  He screws up way too often and has some of the lowest passing percentages ever.  Yes, the Bears went to the Superbowl last year, but it didn't have anything to do with the QB.  Everyone else stepped up their game while Grossman did what he always did....faulter.<br>  <br>  Oh by the way, one player can't lead a team to the Super bowl.  Urlacher isn't a super hero that has all the  power in his hands.  Urlacher is good but definitely not that good to lead an entire team into a super bowl.|`|8af09e2c2aa27e6e5e1a1e6221287b2eaa	As a Bears fan I can say that I wish Rex was a LOT more consistent, but last year was his first full season and he still had 7 games with OVER 100 for a QB rating.  The Bears still scored the 2nd most points in the NFL (tied with Indy BTW).  That's not ALL that bad for a first year starter.  He will be better than last year, hopefully more consistent too but to put him in the same sentence as Hutchinson and McNown is just plain ignorance.  He averaged 205 yards per game last year even with those nasty performances he had, that's 14th in the league overall...middle of the road which OBVIOUSLY is all the Bears need to make it to the Super Bowl and with any luck this year he'll have a 100+ QB rating in AZ.  He was also 8th in the league in TD passes with 24, and threw for 3281 yards, again middle of the road.  <br>  <br>  When he's on he's great, when he's off he's terrible, overall it averages out to an OK QB which is all the Bears need.|`|Kej0WbA5aa	he actually did better in his first full season then Peyton Manning did in his first full season.|`|PXRMVCRpaa	Ha i hope he makes you eat those words this year!!|`|vXKVWhYBaa	There in denile.Rex cant even handle the ball at the snap.|`|H7UUP7aRaa	I think he has 1-2 weeks and if they are not performing he's riding the pine.|`|wD56H6s7aa	It's not that he's bad... He's just really inconsistent.  If he could become consistent, then I could see him becoming much better and leading his team to the Super Bowl instead of letting Urlacher do it.
UloQYBiJaa	Coaches don't give a damn on your background as long as you got skills. Get of you *** and go play alot of ball  right now!! if you want. If you don't want to make the team do not go  play basketball but rather sit here looking at a computer. But if you decide to take the course of hard work... Work on Fundamentals until your arms fall off, run suicides till your lungs say uncle, and just play hard, smart, and show some heart during tryouts and you  will make the team and who knows if you work hard enough well see you in the NBA. Good luck man.|`|UIJZCWPIaa	God I hope not...  if you can make your JV squad having never played and being able to admit that your NOT VERY GOOD than your school is seriously lacking in talent.|`|Vi8JdDEVaa	It depends on what you bring to the table, it could be quickness or height.  But starting at JV without much experience or knowledge of organized basketball is rare.  It can be done don't get me wrong, but you will have to progress fast at whatever position you are trying to play.|`|nvx8RoQMaa	yes, i didn't make my middle school teams or travel teams or anything but the summer before high school i worked sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... hard and i made JV. you gotta have the right mindset though.|`|oqy1EEngaa	start actually practicing for an organized game rather than a street ball game.|`|rNUYqmQPaa	I think it's possible but you will have to learn the hard way.

sd8UJv7Gaa	Do not make this trade. Even though Bedard has not struck out many yet he will. Greinke may look good, but you have to remember what team he plays for. The royals will not get him that many wins, and he doesn't strike out a ton. As for maddux, he should retire after he gets win # 350.|`|5194a9ffd76de84729bb9dfdcf2d81e3aa	Don't make this trade.  Bedard will come around, he struggled in the beginning of last year and ended up being a top pitcher at the end of the season.  He will get more wins this year because SEA has better bats to back him up.  Keep him, don't be foolish!!  I have Bedard too and wouldn't trade him at all right now.|`|Yb8RLwLRaa	NOOOOOOOOOOO|`|28ezfSMhaa	You can't judge Bedard on two games. Keep him. At least wait 2 weeks and see how he does. If you give him up, it could be one of those trades you'll just end up kicking for at the end of the season. <br>  Greinke's cold so far, and he's had a lot more time than Bedard to show his stuff this year. Maddux looks like he's about to kick the bucket. Keep Bedard.|`|b48f2f2c3c698450e4a6f517fc498969aa	Tough one.  I'd go with it.  This could be the 'sell high' point for both Bedard and Greinke this year.  Bedard is more established but Id rather go vs. the bats in the west than the Yanks and Sox.  To me Maddux is only worth starting in every other start.

1d9b5228edfe6d8363220570ff4e828caa	honest answer fudgie...he's a good manager, but some fans wont accept him as he's not "celtic minded" ie he's not a catholic...we've got bigots tae you know...the man's won 3 in a row so he's no an idiot<br>  <br>  * edit - geez a wee text haha!!!|`|5Agn35EKaa	Yes he is a good manager, if he wasn't then he would not have been able to land three titles on a team of dross players and the meagre transfer allowance he has had to manage on. The man has the determination to do his job to the best of his ability with little or no help from the Celtic Board. Gordon Strachan could have walked away at any time, with all the flak he gets from fans and the Media alike I think he shows tremendous strength of mind and will to stay. Without the backing of the fans how can he be expected to improve on what he has done, sometimes I think the fans and Media underestimate him and his abilities.|`|LkpWUUwmaa	Well he hasnt done so far! Strachan is a Scottish legend he has proved it at the top level as a player and as a manager. Ask the Everton supporters of there take on Smith, better than that check out the toffee's web site it will tell you about Smiths time there. Bizzare team selections, and a shocking tactical awareness, dont believe me though check it out yourself.|`|K1ZXTtn4aa	yes, he's managed to win the league 3 years out of 3 and last 16 2 out of 3 on a budget.<br>  <br>  Georgiebob, being celtic minded has nothing to do with being a catholic. Jock Stein was Celtic Minded and he was a protestant|`|f8cYTPflaa	I'd say he is, but I think he's wasted in Scotland, especially at Parkhead. But I still don't think he'll lead Celtic to the title this season....unless he brings his boots out of storage!|`|3fOFbz5Taa	A good manager !!!!|`|V1RsWiAAaa	good enough for 4 in a row<br>  <br>  hail ! hail !<br>  <br>  ho ho ho ho|`|AA12055870	Well the three consecutive championships would prove testament to his abilities.<br>  <br>  As to Wally showing him up, no I don't think so. <br>  <br>  McLeish, Le Guen and now Wally will fall under Chesney's sword.<br>  <br>  4 in a row; 3 managers in a row.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Strachan has won 3 in a row, scottish cup, last 16 of the champs league last 2 years running, what do you think?<br>  <br>  Don't you think "sir" wanker has had enough time to stop him|`|BdiQPKn0aa	Sir Walter will probably show him up <br>  <br>  does this seasons away games in the champions league not tell you how good he is? <br>  <br>  oh aye Davie it's been in the uefa cup they won away i forgot about that|`|exARv7Bmaa	He's too good for Parkhead but whether or not the scum win the league won't make him any better or worse a manager....there's a lot more to it than that.|`|fQgaQx4baa	of course he is he is going for four in a row how long since u heard a rangers manager say that|`|2sxiHRvzaa	i will phone u wi my answer.oh no i canny.oh dear oh dear oh dear

7EuVbDAYaa	like i said in a thread the other day. lovenkrands wasent that bad.. he was played out of postion all the time he was at gers. he was played as a winger, when he said himself he doesent like that postion, he is a striker. and he scored a good few goals(about 18 i think) when big eck finaly played him as a striker. he was gers highest scorer intill boyd came in and over took him, then he was sold<br>  <br>  so if he is played as a striker he is a decent player. and if there not paying for him(just wages) then why not take the boy back.|`|8kpvTUQaaa	Apparently he is according the BBC...but then Beckham trained for a few weeks with Arsenal....and ended up at the San Siro!

He's training there cos he has a family home in Glasgow. He has offered his services to rangers for a token salary whatever that means?? He was on 40k a week at Shalke so wouldnt think you would want to pay even a quarter of that? Was a good player when he could be arsed which wasnt very often.|`|S0LSmJ9haa	yes i heard it Bb..but i think it's cos he is without a club right now they have offered him somewhere to train as his house is in Glasgow?<br>  his agent dismissed any thoughts of him returning yet others say he is prepared to take a wage cut to re-sign.<br>  god only knows to be honest...Boyd out, lovenkrands in?|`|57rbgBw2aa	Ffs' talk about brass necking it, he's a natural hun that wee creep no shame whatsoever.

nH4TOhGVaa	lol no i wont miss him but thanks for showing concern|`|m2zXOREJaa	It's blooming great when you've got AC Milan interested eh Blue,the creme of Italy and what do you gers get Birmingham and Wolves least not forget Spurs.hahahaha<br>   It would be nice for him to play as clubs like that see something Strachan does'nt.i wonder what that is,maybe a Gattuso in the mould or perhaps a Pato or Kaka.<br>  SORRY FOR THE HAHA BIT-you know it makes sense lol|`|lsXcvlTbaa	The much maligned Massimo. Nice guy, decent player, bit of a character but just not up to speed with the Scottish game. As Linzi said, he played well this season before breaking his foot but now the midfield are back fit, he is unlikely to get a look in so good luck to him.|`|57rbgBw2aa	I wouldn't let ma dug wipe it's r'se with that ranker rag let alone read it..Haha|`|5Agn35EKaa	Of course I will miss him like I would miss any player that left. Donati is out of favour at the moment but needs to leave as he so desperately needs to play football on a regular basis and quite rightly so. His highlights were scoring the crucial injury time winner against Shakhtar in the Champions League last season and playing in the game against Dundee United on the final night last season when Celtic won their 3 in a row.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Donati got into the team regularly just before he broke his toe and has been out injured for a wee bit but i thought he was playing ok.  As long as Crosas stays we'll have plenty of cover in midfield though.<br>  How are you the day Bluebell, happy that your man has not agreed personal terms?<br>  Aye, now that an offer has been accepted, others have shown interest.

I don't think Batista is better than him. I think WWE is making Cena lose b/c like you said, they have realized that the fans don't like Superman Cena. I think the creative team wants to get Cena over with the fans by giving him a losing streak. I think Cena will lose until he gets over with the fans again|`|2WAZyjV4aa	well i waz rootin for batista.<br>  Cena Needs A diva or sumtin cause ever since he lost to HHH at Night Of Champions He Loses At Pay-Per-Views<br>  Example<br>  Night Of Champions(HHH Def. John Cena)<br>  The Great American BASH(JBL Def. John Cena)<br>  SummerSlam(Batista Def. John Cena)<br>  He needs to think of sumtin to help him win or its dayjavough at unforgiven|`|Vi5oBm9naa	I was hoping cena wud win but i suppose cena can come back and prob beat batista in a re-match were-as batista wud'nt be able to come back after losin 2 cena they'll prob have a re-match on raw 2nite n cena will win|`|810onUEjaa	I want to see a losing streak like tatanka and Cena turns around and becomes a heel.|`|voDpSabcaa	If they think hes superman then change his gimmick to superman and dress him up as superman |`|cw9QSSDUaa	Go Batista!|`|J5vjhmA2aa	I didn't really care for either but if I had to choose I would go with Cena I geuss.|`|kbRS80xxaa	i wanted either but if cena does not start winning i think he may get sacked|`|8wwPUow9aa	either|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I wanted Batista to win. Either way though i won in the end haha. I was very happy with the outcome of the match. I cant wait for raw tonight. <br>  Cena will have more losses. he will also go back to a good winning streak. we just have to see how things play out from here. |`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	I liked how it went. They had to make Cena lose at one point and make Batista finally win at a PPV after several losses. But I think that Cena will put up with a few losses in the future still. But I think that some fatal four way or triple threat match is coming up on Unforgiven.
JCf5jSJLaa	you could always try the sports cafe on the strand, they show loads of sport hence the name lol, its not like a dingy old bar its a proper cool looking place, anyway im 100% sure they will show the race and there is bound to be quite a few people in there so your gonna get an atmosphere, sorry if you were'nt looking for anything in the slightest like a pub lol but this is all i can think of|`|shXjyJWBaa	On a tv in your living room on ITV that's the 3 on your remote.

02ebed155e445123423a1be7f1f23d68aa	I totaly agree with you. I grew up on WWF....this whole WWE with the "modern" way of wrestling is more like a soap opera then sports entertainment. I watch the pay per views on occasion but I rarely tune in to the weekly stuff anymore ... just not worth the headache and diminished IQ points.|`|a3951c187dff712309ec86c499ff166baa	Ken Kenndey is incredibly NOT boring.  I'm not quite sure what it is that you consider entertaining in wrestling, but that guy's got "future champion" written all over him.  The fact that you're talking about things that are boring, and this question is NOT about John Cena, makes me wonder.<br>  <br>  It's not the wrestlers that are boring, it's the WWE style of wrestling that's boring.|`|78d46de82dc8976af0d65d2e281b1206aa	exactly and a good point proven. what is happening to wwe? the wwe we used to love where anything could happen and hardcore title would be defeneded all the time. if wcw was still in business i would watch wcw more. but atleast we get to see undertaker and chris beniot and the divas and extreme rules matches in ecw but it isnt the same. it isnt as good as it used to be.|`|0ad40eccbb17ba100de4456578ca9aa3aa	Vince let Maven go. They are boring cause they do the same moves every match.|`|AA12213679	So true that's why I watch TNA now Sting is over there along with Angle and a few others from WWE!!|`|AA12340278	I think Mr Kennedy has got a good wrestling future in WWE because he has the attitude but the rest suck.The WWE creative team have rushed people like Cena and Batista to the top too fast but there again WWE haven't got wrestlers like Stone Cold and The Rock anymore.People like Triple H took years to get as many title reigns as they have now but Cena has been Champ about 3 ties this year alone(he wins and wins the title..he loses and loses the title)he's like Triple H because they both like hogging the Championship.|`|2e5906dfe7d04649700c6454a8f2156eaa	well, some of the up n' coming stars have yet to prove themselves. so far, Ken Kennedy is making a name for himself. i was pretty impressed by his talent during his debut. his rolling samoan drop off the top rope was a pretty impressive finisher, and he cracks me up too. MVP, however, sucks to high hell. he's like Jonathan Coachman's younger brother, who does a poor variation of the people's elbow (which he showed during his recent SmackDown no-DQ match with Kane).|`|3dcdcc112dfa974c64928304c1cd29acaa	Its not the so much the wrestlers that are boring, its the garbage that Vince and his buttkissing writers write for them that make it boring. Not only boring , but corny , ridiculous , and non-beleivable. The wrestlers only do what they're told and most of them will never reach they're full potential in the wwe because Vince won't let them create they're own characters and write they're own promos. WWE has some very talented performers that can make it big and turn the wwe back into the media powerhouse that it once was but they have to be used the right way. My personal favorites are guys that are not only great wresters but are great actors, promo cutters and storytellers. I would try to build raw around DX right now because they are veterans and they can get the young guys over but the story has to be right, i mean c'mon vince where's the creativity? Thow  a couple of young members in like cryme time or carlito, get some titles involved and find the right foes to make people want to watch. Edge is the over-rated superstar and Orton's lack of charisma and in-ring ability will never draw a big crowd.<br>     Smackdown is different, unlike raw they have very little talent on they're roster. But without a doubt, the Undertaker should be holding that championship belt and leading the way. Kennedy has charisma but lacks the in-ring skills to ever be great, MVP is still too unexperienced, Lashley and batista are nothing more then big stong juiced up guys who would have been stars in the eighties but this is the year 2006 and the fans prefer more charisma and wrestling skill from the champion. King Booker should go back to being Booker-T, how stupid is his gimmick? what a waste of a great talent. Anyways, like i said Undertaker should carry the belt and guys like Kane, Benoit, Matt Hardy and Booker-T (not king booker) should be the guys trying to take it from him.That would be a start in the right direction as long as the stories are interesting, intense and beleivable.|`|77541d09453978c4f7995ce2dfd3e4ccaa	Vince wanted the good pros to work harder and not pay them more for the work and most of the old wrestlers cant handle the punishmient it takes so they have to retire and  most of the good ones now have jumped ship to acting or TNA.|`|81671fe5a708f5d48a4ba05ca505cc23aa	Vince is all about change and trying to reach younger generations in a particular era. (I heard him say something like this on Howard Stern's show 2 years ago) He's not targeting people now who watched the WWE 10-20 years ago. He mostly has guys who are trying to find out what young people (I say from 11 yrs old - 26 yrs old) are in to, and he adapts it into the entertainment on his show for that time period. He needs more and more viewers to watch and pay to see the show, and he believes that sticking with old ideas will drive today's youth away from it.|`|aae8e0dad7c9ee4a2a1ed53857b87ce9aa	Storylines are boring because there is no competition!!! The best days of wrestling were when WCW was in business and the two companies tried to outdo each other every week. Until TNA gets a Monday night timeslot across from RAW................continue watching boring wrestling.

2cb3153c313f04e3810e6bc6151a9494aa	Toyota made a choice to remain on dry tires in hopes of moving up the finishing order.  Had they pitted when Vettel and Hamilton did, they would have come out behind them, though been capable of a greater pace... but they were not close to this battle before and it's unlikely they would have somehow gained 10+ seconds since Hamilton didn't stall while in the pits getting the intermediate tires.<br>  <br>  With Glock staying out, he was now ahead of Hamilton, which then made the Hamilton/Vettel battle important... if you recall prior to the rain, it wasn't an issue and had Vettel moved up quicker, Hamilton probably would've just let him pass for 4th place.<br>  <br>  By the last lap the track was quite wet and Glock would be spending more time simply trying to keep the car on the road rather than being able to keep pace or protect his line (and with the difference in pace, there really was nothing he could do to protect his line against Hamilton and Vettel).<br>  <br>  Given how much the extra points would've meant to both Glock and Toyota, it's silly to even think he'd of slowed down more than he needed to in order to give Hamilton a chance.  If he had pitted and had intermediates, yes, he'd of had more pace and been able to defend his line... but he would've already been behind Hamilton!<br>  <br>  The fact is this was a great race, and all of the key players mentioned in this did everything right:<br>  <br>  Massa - he drove a great race and did everything possible to put himself in a position to claim a title.  Kimi did his part too with a good pace and kept ahead of the Mclarens (and possibly even slowing down some in the middle of the race in an attempt to goad Hamilton into racing him).<br>  <br>  Hamilton - kept his head about him and kept sight of the big picture!  He dominated his last win to set this up, and followed up with doing exactly what he needed to secure a title!<br>  <br>  Glock - while his pace was much slower at the end, he did manage to effectively gain a few seconds in terms of overall track position by remaining on dry tires, and came very close to netting extra points as a result (and making it a very different championship).  If the rain came half a lap later, this stategy would've worked perfectly... and a half lap earlier it would've lost him huge chunks of time.  A good gamble that almost paid off.|`|XXm2yCHiaa	Nope.|`|7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	Nope, glock gamble on staying on groove tires, and it didnt pay off. It became too wet<br>  <br>  But he was still pathetic. He did not even attempt to defend. He moved aside faster than a lapped car<br>  <br>  He did not did it on purpose, there's no reason for that. But he could have at least try defending it. Not a good driver IMO.|`|dUN468v3aa	I did wonder that myself, but he was still on dry tyres and struggling badly throughout the final lap. When I watched the replay of the finish, he had barely made the pit lane entrance as Hamilton was crossing the line. The other thing that makes me doubt it is his total lack of motivation to do so. He had nothing to gain or lose by dropping back to allow Hamilton into 5th place.<br>  <br>  I think that Toyota took a gamble that he'd lose more time changing to wet tyres than keeping him out there on dry tyres, especially as it wasn't raining all that hard at the time. He was a long way up the field so they gambled on him not being passed too many times and getting a good finishing position as a result. Unfortunately it would seem that the track conditions on the last lap were worse than anticipated.<br>  <br>  **EDIT**<br>  <br>  I'm not sure why people think Glock only messed up on the last couple of corners. He didn't. His entire last lap was shot to bits. I can only assume that some folk didn't see the race or failed to understand what was happening.<br>  <br>  Glock was a country mile ahead of Hamilton who was doing all he could to get back at Vettel, but he was already way off the pace and falling back into their clutches anyway. All Vettel and Hamilton had to do was go fast enough to make sure they caught him before he reached the chequered flag. Any attempt by Glock to defend his position was going to be completely futile because he just had no grip at all. The last two corners are all about getting the power down to slingshot up the hill and that was the one thing he just couldn't do. If he'd gone anywhere near the throttle pedal the car would have just swapped ends and he wouldn't even have finished. The only choice he had was to decide whether to stay on the racing line and allow them to pass him on his left or move off it so they could pass him on his right.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Nope, Glock stayed out on slick tires (taking a chance that the rain wouldn't last) when Hamilton changed his tyres to intermediates. It was a mistake by Glock which meant he had virtually no control over his car. Hamilton on the other hand had tyres that were suited to the weather conditions which allowed him to absolutely blow Glock out of the water on the second to last corner. That is how he won the championship!|`|cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	No. Toyota gambled and kept the dry tyres on when it started to rain when all the other teams changed theirs, and unfortunately the gamble didn't pay off and both the cars were barely able to stay on the track in the last lap.|`|8Uy59oqIaa	no he didn't !!!<br>  <br>  glock = dry tyres when it was wet<br>  <br>  lewis = wet tyres<br>  <br>  can you see now ???|`|JNs2qOVsaa	I was desperately rooting for Massa but even i don't believe all this conspiracy crap. The fact was, Glock kept his dry tyres on to try and leapfrog all the drivers in the pits and hoping the rain would wear off, it didn't it got worse and he was on dry tyres on an anything but dry track, its not a surprise he had to slow down to a crawling pace just to keep it on the track. Believe me i was SO annoyed at Glock, i was rotting for him the entire race to overtake Hamilton and then that happens! but ah well, it wasn't intentional. |`|AA10889612	No! <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: The world is full of mean minded people especially it would appears those of hispanic origins.<br>  <br>  Why do some people not give credit where credit is due. Lewis Hamilton showed tenancity and guts leave the man alone and say 'Well done Lewis and here's to the next time !|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Of course not and if you think so, you're an idiot.  Glock had the same final lap time as his teammate.  And why would Glock want to give up a position for McLaren?  Everything in this world just has to be a conspiracy, doesn't it?!|`|pbpMH3ZGaa	Better still do you think that Kimi pulled over ( very blatantly) a couple of races ago to let his team mate pass, mmmm and Glock aint even a team mate of Hamilton so you tell me clever clogs just why would he do that ?????|`|bqpdjkRoaa	Why would he? what would be the reason? did he want to let Vettel pass also? he was on dry tyres and struggled for the whole of the last lap, the gamble did not pay off, if the rain had eased, it would have done.|`|KTxxd700aa	Sigh, YES it was lucky for Hamilton BUT if Glock had pitted for wet tyres like everyone else, he would of been being Hamilton anyway|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	He was was just lucky that Glock was on slicks when the rain started to pour down and it must have been like driving on ice.|`|efwciT9Yaa	Yes|`|wOwHliwjaa	OH MY GOD! Listen to the crap being dished out by the conspiracy theorists. Hamilton won the world championship. That is the end of story. Glock was on dry tyres. F1 does not revolve around Ferrari. There are other teams out there. This year McLaren won the drivers championship even though Ferrari had by far the superior car. Massa or Kimi should of had the title wrapped up 3 or 4 races ago. But neither of them are good drivers so the cars were wasted on them. If Hamilton is crap what does that make kovalienon? If Massa was any good he would not of lived in the shadow of Schumacher. Hamilton was expected to be number 2 at Mclaren but was having none of it comfortably out performing Alonso on numerous occasions. Admittandly Pound for pound Alsonso is probably the best driver around. But to say Glock gave the race to Hamilton is a big pile of Bullshit. Also remember the world championship started 16 races ago not in Brazil.|`|cU3dgYVkaa	Of course!  Anyone with any F-1 common sense knows that you just don't slow down like that!  He was doing fine until the last curve? hahah what a joke!  This without a doubt proves that F-1 is a ridiculous game of who can out cheat the others...McLaren should be investigated again for this...Once a cheater, always a...<br>  <br>  Even with the engine blow out with 3 laps left in Hungary, the Pit mess up by the Ferrari crew in Singapore, Massa was in contention and to me he proved he is the superior driver by dominating the Qualifying, turning in the fastest laps over and over again and dominating the final race from start to finish.  What did Hamilton do the entire race? He almost spun 3 or 4 times, couldn't even get past Vettel and had to count on Timo Glock letting him by to secure 5th place! haha I'm sorry, but he is not as good as people say he is.  <br>  <br>  It's about money and status. The Brits were dying to have another as world champion. Hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing and product sales, etc depended on him being champion. There was no way the British mafia behind McLaren would have allowed LH to leave Brazil without the championship...they were determined to do whatever it took to win, including cheating... <br>  <br>  Ah just another day in F-1...|`|bX6492hvaa	yep. I knew he was on dry tires and i still think that he gave it away. McLaren mmust have payed them to give them fifth place. how far can McLaren go before they get banned from the sport however. What's so special about Hamilton anyway. Look at Vettel and he didn't go straight into a McLaren did he. Someone crash into hamilton. See his reaction. And show the reality of Formula 1. Alonso should make him crash. That would be funny|`|CVG8n5m6aa	No, Glocks lap was faster on the final lap than the other guy on dry (Trulli) (who was 9th). Surely if he slowed down to let Hamilton win he wouldve had the slowest last lap out of everyone.|`|441d1a7b10ddf0bb4fda6250fc56881caa	So  it was okay to let Vettel go past but NOT OKAY to let Lewis go past as well ?  Are you forgetting that both drivers gained places because of Glock ? |`|aKKrJy0Faa	I was reckoning it....but later learned that he was on dry weather .....so surely he didnt gift that place to hammy....|`|JJyQvTQmaa	I don't think so. Who Hamilton think he is? What's Glock point by given the 5th place to Hamilton? Glock was just messed up. If Only rain never fall down..|`|UzsR1W3Kaa	Probably yesterday Glock was sleeping with All pussycat Dolls as the bribe .... included nicole . |`|rQu179CCaa	LMAO AT PPL WHO SAYS "NO" IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS THAT GLOCK GIFTED THE FIFTH PLACE TO HAMILTON<br>  <br>  PPL THESE DAYZ|`|XpwqNXcDaa	TBH It did seem a bit coincidental that Glock messed up.|`|CyIbg8zAaa	NO

mSZoMKD6aa	Goram or was it the Michelin man, wisnae sure sometimes when Rangers played, Goram had so much bandages and padding on.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Blinkers off - Goram by a country mile|`|2sxiHRvzaa	goram.im honest enuff to admit it|`|9MtS42oWaa	Id go with Goram (As it stands) However if you thought Boruc lacked class, Goram was a hundred times worse, as he recently revealed calling P.V.H. a Black Fenien Bastard. And he battered his Missus.|`|m2zXOREJaa	 Golam by far,as trying to score against him was Blue Mordor|`|wkJ8E4qEaa	none|`|nH4TOhGVaa	goram but just shows u genius has its flaws|`|cTTmHn9paa	I was too young to remember Goram, but what videos i've seen of Goram, I would say playing their best on the day Boruc is just as good as Goram.  All those Boruc compilations are not on youtube for nothing, the ability is there, but his head is not!|`|lsXcvlTbaa	Goram played for more seasons so at the moment I would say him but Boruc is a superb keeper who is off form and has achieved more at international level than the flying pig did|`|57rbgBw2aa	It's Boruc by a mile, Goram only ever played great games against Celtic and I'm sure that was more hate filled than skillful|`|c97e18e356f8c6c65740d12fc018416baa	Would say Anne Marie is bang on,took me a while with Goram to realise how hard you have to practise to get that lucky.|`|MPqO1Qayaa	Goram by a mile.<br>  <br>  he's also the best British keeper iv saw in my years, in my opinion|`|DpfJfK6Baa	mcalpine...  oh ok then, goram.  |`|1d9b5228edfe6d8363220570ff4e828caa	gorum at the moment imho...|`|b378fc3361a04779c15bf427c58b87afaa	Goram, (the mad shagger of the caravan) but unfortunately he is a bigoted piece of turd who runs about with loyalists in northern Ireland thinking he matters.  Blinkers are essential for the flying pig, his birds compared to Arturs are nowhere near them, total care in the community cases, Artur, super model material..|`|K1ZXTtn4aa	its Boruc due to the fact hes been recognised all over europe as one of the top keepers. Goram was only good in Scotland.<br>  <br>  ok i'll try to answer properly now, both at their best and against world class opposition Boruc would also come out on top as he has the experience and a proven track record at the top<br>  <br>  both at their best in scotland, neither would loose any goals so it would possibly be a draw so i guess thats 3-1 to Boruc|`|7KkrXlalaa	As a bhoy i hate to admit it,but Goram was absolutely world class and a keeper any fan would have loved to see playing for them.For a fat bloke he covered the goals brilliantly and was a 1st class shot stopper.<br>  Therefore,Goram takes it for me.|`|5Agn35EKaa	At his peak Andy Goram was a difficult man to score against, Boruc at his peak is almost a match for Goram. I said almost but not quite.|`|AA11691112	Goram.  |`|yNln23Ifaa	Close call but i have to goram, better shot stopper and less accident prone

You should think about going fishing coz when you dangle the bait they all bite.|`|5itGC9XYaa	well I certainly had a giggle at it,very good indeed.|`|8qs1l3zVaa	17 dollars too thats sad...thats only about 8 quid here :(|`|2sxiHRvzaa	excellent stuff caine.bill.have a star|`|ePFdhsCYaa	You would have to be a right diddy to sit and write that stuff. Celtic fans crawling all over it per usual lol!!!!
S0LSmJ9haa	thought of the day from the great impartial me!!<br>  <br>  they disagreed on personal terms..I guess that means he wanted higher wages, now that there is a chance he will be staying at Rangers will this prove to be his downfall?, if Minty wanted to sell him to balance the books and Boyd refused the wages will he be punished?..or in another respect will Boyd feel the same loyalty to Rangers knowing they tried to sell him? if they can't sell another top player to balance the books will they make it impossible for him to stay..leaving him on the bench etc?<br>  maybe i should have asked my own questions!!|`|7EuVbDAYaa	because brum are a championship side and cant afford any more. <br>  and it was personal details that stopped the move. so mayby they would pay more if gers held out.<br>  <br>  and saying that why would a prem team not go in for him is just stupid. why are prem teams not going in for scott mcdonald. why they not going in for henry why not david villa??????<br>  <br>  there are plenty of players up for sale. so why not buy them?? it dont work that way you fool <br>  <br>  caine your a muppper|`|bzwSCm6taa	lol.....he is worth that to us..pretty damn obvious he is where most of our goals come from..anyway where have i missed the 8 million plus bid for the roly poly....plus on the downside i would have to change my pretty avie....:-(<br>  <br>  oh silly me......AVATAR..slap my hand!!!!!!|`|fQgaQx4baa	if he was that good surely a premiership team would have bid for him as there a few premiership teams on the lookout for a striker|`|8qs1l3zVaa	IDK maybe couldn't afford 4 million quid Birmingham are not that great of clubs...no offence to rangers fans but it isn't hardly Chelsea or Liverpool|`|GkFlzMHMaa	That's right caine your learning. Sky Sports is the place for info, wonder who put that idea in your head eh? <br>  <br>  <br>  As for Boyd, he is a bit of a ********, got a nice talent there, but he is one moody self-fish prick. I'm sure if Rangers were not as desperate to sell him, they could get more than 4 Million for him, but first come first serve, and since Birmingham probably cannot afford to give more than 4 Million, there is your reasons..<br>  <br>  <br>  Now for your next lesson. Since YOU claim that Boruc is worth double, why don't you prove this, cannot make claims with-out prove, because it kind of makes self-proclaimed Celtic fans stupid..Now off you go and find me a link...|`|5Agn35EKaa	Boyd got too greedy and Mc Leish knows he wasn't worth it or he would have paid the piper. Bet it was a slap in the face of Boyd to find out he isn't rated that highly by his ex-boss.|`|ZvlLmDlgaa	Should i change my "avvie" too ?|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Birmingham are only a Chmpionship side, i can't see them spending above that on ne player.<br>  <br>  There has been a 9million pound deal apparently been done between Celtic and i think was Stuttgart for Boruc.  It's apparently signed sealed and delivered but you know what rumours are like<br>  <br>  It was just a gossip site i read it on, so i don't know if there is any truth in it
9MtS42oWaa	Caine i will never forget that Mild Spring Thursday evening, my missus came in from work and my house was awash with Green, White and Gold inside and out. She wasn't best pleased with the Garden decorations that evening but it was my night and i Loved it.|`|lsXcvlTbaa	It was one of the best feelings ever. Only bettered by stopping the 10. Getting a fourth title will be an amazing achievement and I will looking forward to celebrating. |`|fQgaQx4baa	whatever makes the bluenoses unhappy makes me happy<br>  <br>  matty who me ????|`|EsTAylwIaa	already thinking of 5IAR caine |`|mSZoMKD6aa	First of all to the prick above me, I hope you have a long and painful death ya sick bastard.<br>  <br>  Charlie, as to your question, I think Rangers fans have been living in denial for 4 years now. I mean lets look at last year, how they actually thought they were gonna win the Quadruple HaHaHa, so part of this denialititis they have probably forgotten last season already and how for the past 3 seasons the flag has flew at Celtic |`|c97e18e356f8c6c65740d12fc018416baa	Slappy just because you steal a car don't make it yours(not unless you know the right people anyway) and let me say the thing that makes me happy and never fails to give me a wee grin is when i think or hear the word quadruple,i think i will enjoy it more each passing year when the realisation sinks in about the massive financial gulf between Celtic and The Rank Rotten Mob they better get used to getting the odd cup ,because that's going to be about the size of it for a while.|`|K1ZXTtn4aa	I do remember. I think only 9 in a row n then 10 in a row will feel that good but I'm hardly gona be disappointed at our team with all these crap player the huns keep going on about win the league by 10-20 points. If it does go to the last day again the feeling might be close though I doubt that'll happen.<br>  <br>  I agree with AnnMarie aboout stopping the ten but that feeling was over the next day when Wim left. I'm still buzzing coz of last seasons finish....We saved the makers of rocky millions as they dont need to make rocky 7 now|`|5Agn35EKaa	Course it will be better, I will be ecstatic,jumping for joy as I have been for the last three years.Its the one part of the year I can happily shout "who erra people" and no-one answers me.|`|HCpNcT9qaa	Sure do! Was the best birthday a ever had! :) Might be a bit happier this year though as we didn't celebrate a lot coz of the death of Tommy Burns. :(|`|V1RsWiAAaa	I will be over the moon but will be happier when we win 5 in a row|`|qhPQvwzGaa	yeah i remember and will be very happy when we win again this season :)|`|3fOFbz5Taa	Ha Ha Gers will have this years title  !!!!|`|0xBPshK9aa	happier than I was last year. what celtic fan wouldn't be.. rangers fan's on the other hand will be______ ______ ______ lol  your all lucky you can celebrate I'll be stuck with a dour faced hun bf LOL|`|AA12055870	Well I was in this pub in Shawlands, and walked in with my mate and stood in the doorway in shock (before the matches started) after being told they were showing both games.<br>  <br>  A wee nyaff said "Celtic game at the back" with a jerk of his thumb. So off we trotted to the back, cramped and only two screens dedicated in this "neutral" bar.<br>  <br>  What we at the back couldn't understand was how the commentary didn't match the action. Then we found out they were running the Rangers commentary only.<br>  <br>  By this time half pi$hed and miffed at the bias of the "neutrality", I asked who made the choice for single commentary. The manager pointed to the Rangers fans.<br>  <br>  Oh the delicious irony of this, when the first Aberdeen goal went in. The front of the pub was silent.<br>  <br>  When Vinegar Strokes scored, the front of the pub emptied and the party began, and when Aberdeen scored again, well needless to say the gloating smile I gave the barman was plain to see.<br>  <br>  But winning it this year would be even better.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	The more we win, the better it gets
7Tw7s6HSaa	Lol, what's Timmy's problem?<br>  <br>  The Hokey Cokey, why don't you go and get a life like all the other Rangers fans who were deluded into thinking we care one bit about it, lol - we'd have to have a very sad life to let something as pathetic as that annoy us.   Do you sing it cos you're banned from singing everything else, LOL.<br>  <br>  FQ - I don't understand what is going on at Rangers|`|bzwSCm6taa	well there must be something in the water today cos i agree with tatty again....i really did think he would have been a star for us..sadly not the case....so 8 grand a week will do for now i suppose<br>  <br>  i said the sources were not objective...lol|`|7EuVbDAYaa	he was never given a decent chance under walter smith<br>  <br>  when big eck was here wee burke and steven smith (LB) were top class.<br>  but both got injured and especially stevie smith were not given a chance under walter smith.<br>  <br>  its a shame really because they could have been big players for us. and thomas buffel comes under that as well|`|57rbgBw2aa	Somebody stamp on that cockroach the thing's disgusting.. Hell mend that wee traitor he caused his family nothing but grieff,  out the same mould as that other selfish midget Maureen Johnstone... 2nd raters that couldn't attract Celtic scouts when younger..|`|5itGC9XYaa	They have got themselves a bargain,even if they had paid the ￡150,000 he was worth a lot more than that.|`|nH4TOhGVaa	lol maybe they need to cut corners|`|lKdLsRPDaa	I rated Burke when he came on the scene, thought he was a great wee exciting winger, reminiscent of days of old, but through injuries and drop in form and consistency he just no cut the mustard. <br>  <br>  Not that his sale is going to sort Rangers finances out, but he just does not merit an ￡8,000 a week wage, for the part he plays. and in the current climate, ￡416,000 a year, is ￡416,000 a year, Rangers really need tae get rid off.|`|GkFlzMHMaa	I wonder if i should Violate Linz, like she does to me and others for completely flanking the Question, and attacking others opinions?<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW Timmy watch your -self around here, i think i know who you are but never mind. They will gang up on you ( expect all your answers to get the itchy finger crew) Your not allowed to say any-thing bad about there club or them, but remember there allowed to do it to you....|`|8tnKpZcoaa	Your postings reveal a lot about you, a gloating underachieving unlikeable snakelike coward, whose warped mind displays an unhappy<br>  childhood, in all probability been abused, yet will not face reality and wishes misfortune on others in an effort to generate self comfort,unfortunately for you this condition is usually untreatable and it will compound itself the longer your pitiful existence continues, I would wish you well in the future but I won`t as I detest you,get a new little green jerkin you cretin as the one you wear is hoaching with lice.|`|5Agn35EKaa	With a name like Timmy Cockroach it is laughable for him to say anyone is hoaching with lice. Sounds like the wee cockroach is two sandwiches short of a picnic.|`|TV56G9qTaa	was a good player but just didn't make it.

OpL8P99naa	I prefer a wetsuit over 68 degrees (minimum). I only lasted 18 minutes at 65 degrees in a 3/5, hood, booties, and gloves. You'll lose a lot more body heat a lot faster in the wetsuit. If there are "critters" in the water where you are going, and you are sensitive to them, a dry suit will keep them away from your skin as well (just something else to consider). Over 75 degrees, I don't think I'd be too comfortable in a dry suit, are you?|`|eXz0xCXOaa	there's a difference?|`|ynj5po8maa	I prefer wetsuits because they are much easier to put on. Also, they are cheaper. And rember, wetsuits will be WET and drysuits will be DRY when you wear them.

Gj8JTJGRaa	No only now and then.<br>  <br>  im a boxer myself and i`ve been taught that weights make you stiff and if you want to box that isn`t a good thing.<br>  <br>  things like push ups and sit ups are good and of course running is the best.|`|zHs8Cd6caa	they do a lot of ab workouts so they don't get destroyed by body shots. punching all day with those gloves on gives them muscles. the lighter weight boxers don't really lift weights but the big boys do so they can throw those haymakers|`|aVcxc9ykaa	yes but light weights and high reps.  If you notice, boxers are not bulky like pro wrestlers are or linebackers.  People that want to bulk will do heavy weight and less reps.|`|zMD0VeOmaa	of course. they have to. if you were a boxer you would want to be in the best shape possible to avoid getting hurt more. If they don't lift weights they won't be able to punch with enough force to hurt the other fighter.
h5P4H4SHaa	yes|`|AA11307224	They can, but they won't.  Tennessee has the best running game in the league going against a defense that is 28th in the league against the run.  Add to that the fact that Bob Sanders is out, and Indy's defense will not be able to stop the run.<br>  <br>  On offense, the Colts run game is suffering with Addai out due to injury.  This kills their play action passing game because the defense will not respect the threat of Dominic Rhodes.  And since Indy's front 5 are still banged up going against the Titans dominant d-line, I think it will be a long night for the Colts.  <br>  <br>  Tennessee will win the game based on time of possession and ball control.  Titans win 24-14.|`|5tuWA7S2aa	Yes they can, only if Manning can keep is composure. They also need to tighten up the rushing defense.|`|jn7hxEA7aa	Depends on what Manning come out there tonight.  If the Peyton we all now comes out there with a W on his mind then yes the Colts will win.  I say tonight Titans streak ends Colts wins 28-24|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Titans will win at home.|`|QW3tkVt7aa	Can the Colts defense, without Sanders, stop Lendale White and Chris Johnson?  No.  <br>  <br>  Jeff Fisher's plan is always the same: dominate on defense and control the clock when your offense is on the field.  Defensively, I doubt they will have many problems with the Colts.  Fisher's Cover-2 scheme is pretty effective against the Colts when Manning *is* playing good.  Without being able to stop the Titans' ground game, the Colts will find it difficult to stay in this game.  |`|9iB1AiQlaa	Yes they can. the Colts have the talent to do it. Its whether or not they show up to play. I am curious to see if Peyton and the rest of the crew get in sync with each other. Indy's D is horrible, which is a surprise because having Tony Dungy as your coach, they should be a lot better even though historically Indy never has a top ten D.|`|XuGFt3boaa	Well, the Colts got banged up last week against Green Bay.  If their offensive line can stop the Titans defensive line, they might have a shot.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	I'm certainly hoping so!

bf85fc1fa1e258360c2abd654d161748aa	Because over the course of the Formula One Season he amassed more points than his rivals. You get 10 points for winning a race, 8  for 2nd, 6 for 3rd, then 5-4-3-2-1. |`|X4hz3a9haa	i am not either, i think it works on a points system.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Lewis had enough points in the bag over the whole season  that meant Massa could only overtake him (in terms of points) if Massa came 1st and Hamilton came lower than fifth. As Hamilton (just) managed to get the place he needed & the points he required. He stayed ahead of Massa in the drivers championship by one point & therefor got the title.|`|Go8LfupAaa	He came fifth in the Brazilian GP  but they accumulate points all season from all their grand prix. Hamilton only needed the fifth place points to have more points than everyone else.|`|qqeLsAUTaa	yeah... unfortuly he get on the last curve he and Vettel get from 5 and 6th places for 4th and 5th places...

Similar as in football, a football club can still win overall even if they have the highest points.|`|fi3A6NZmaa	It's all the points over the course of the season, just cause he didn't do as well in this one, he still was in front after the points had been added up.|`|C8VuzOCjaa	Its all done on points, you get more points the higher you come.<br>  lewis was leading on points and could only lose if he came sixth or lower.<br>  Thats all lol|`|082c52d49d24cf249ff2b1bcab72a8f7aa	positonal points count .. making him the overall winner.<br>  <br>  yeh, what Gilly said..

I say Go for it. If you hve faith in your abilities then that is all you need. What college do you attend right now? You should ask their athletic director about walk-ons! Best of luck to you, I really hope you make it, how exciting :)|`|OeSZZ3UBaa	Most colleges allow walk-ons.  Walk-ons (if they do not make the team) usually make up the practice squad.  <br>  You should pick a college by what you want academically, not by playing football.<br>  With your size, I think you should be able to find a spot on a small school team.  You will have to learn the basics, but if you are athletic, you should have a very good chance.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10677310	Go to a JC (Junior college) and show them what you can do.

qTZCWlXBaa	for the same reason your can of beans have lids.  So they stay airtight so they are fresh when you first open them.  They put the three new fuzzy balls in the can (freshly inflated) and they seal it tight with that metal part (the can lid in your words).  Now, no air can get out from the balls and no air can come into the can so the balls stay clean and unaffected by the natural elements such as air and water.  You will notice that the cans have alot of pressure inside them.  Enough pressure that the plastic lid just cannot handle.  Some cans may need to be on the shelf for a long time and have to travel long distances to get to your tennis court.<br>  <br>  maybe the cans are inflated so when they are transported, because the can will not crush easily, it protects the balls from being bumped or crushed and you should know that anytime a tennis ball is hit or bounces on the ground that a little bit of air comes out of it.  again to keep that air in the can so it pushes out against the inside walls of the can needs to stay in there and we can only accomplish that with a can lid that is sealed tightly.<br>  <br>  the main reason for the can lid is, again to keep the pressure in the can, but not for freshness, but so you can remove the plastic lid, throw the can up as high in the air as you can and....BOOM! what you have is a great warm up exercise of "reacting to all three balls flying in the air and catching them as fast as you can"|`|gnRiLwSxaa	Most of these answers are not clear at all.   The metal lid is there to keep the air pressure in the container until it is opened.   Tennis balls have air pressure higher than normal air pressure, because it makes them bounce better.  A week or two after the cans are opened, the balls lose so much pressure that they are almost unplayable..|`|3b64d55f38714d4b534a070ab26f5d48aa	Too expensive to use cotton.|`|PH32ZB4Haa	ya know that sound when you open the ball???? the sound like air coming out???? thats because there is air in the can to keep the balls fresh and new. Thats why at junior tournaments they wait until your about to go on the court to open the can of balls...to keep them new and fresh!!!! so that they bounce better! =D|`|KtdlJbrOaa	So the balls don't fall out!|`|lKPbVcIxaa	so they can stay fresh and bounce well|`|VnRFRfQ4aa	so they don't fall out|`|AA10110101	Whew! What a variety of answers.<br>  Clearly, the plastic lid has nothing to do with maintaining air pressure. That is accomplished by sealing the tube with the metal lid. Once the tube or can is opened, the plastic lid will not keep in the pressure.<br>  This leaves the lid as having one major function. After the tube is opened, the lid serves to keep the balls in the tube if you choose to save the balls for later use. <br>  There is also a second function served by the lid, although it is undoubtedly a minor one. Before the can is opened, the lid covers the opening ring and prevents intentional (as in the stores) or accidental opening of the can before it is ready to be used. But this is a minor function compared to that of keeping the opened balls in the can.hooked the opening ring.<br>  <br>  |`|AqBwyqGXaa	well the plastic lid is to keep in the can<br>  but the tin part of the can is to seal the balls so they don't get old, like when you leave a ball outside for a long time. This way they don't get old or flat just sitting in the store|`|ZG0IjkTRaa	It is a manufacturer design to stabilize the plastic material of the can in the manufacturing process. Along the production line, a clamp hold on on to the lid, which is the more solid part of the can,  as the can being filled with balls.|`|G3ZRzmOKaa	So the balls will stay in the can. This is a dumb question.|`|167a92d2c026384386d6e492d84f8cf7aa	So that the balls will stay in place and not fall out.|`|J5lbOn4Paa	"You can't be serious!!!"|`|pIZeUxDjaa	so the tennis balls don't flatten out before you us it!:]|`|SjYIHj99aa	of course they do so they dont fall out!!!!!!!111
xhPKkkELaa	When you feel too cold! Then you either pack it in for the winter, or buy a full wetsuit.|`|Op1WIwyPaa	I would wear a spring suit until the water hits under 60F. However it is a personal preference.<br>  <br>  The Surfboard Man<br>  <a href="http://www.thesurfboardman.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesurfboardman.com/</a>|`|WRpkUGcHaa	Kim is pretty much right. i would usually start wearing a springsuit in early Oct, a 3/2 late Oct/early Nov, then booties, then thicker suits, etc. i have to admit--i usually break out my suits a touch earlier than most....i hate cold. i worked in 2 surf shops in VB and that's pretty much what we told the people that asked that question. |`|955cd4c5b601f9a08d8fd8e5ebbaf7ffaa	It depends on the person really, If you are pretty comfortable in a spring suit in the winter then your fine but you will be able to tell if it gets to cold for you. <br>  I live S. Cal and I can't even wear a spring suit the water here is nearly freezing year long. |`|ynj5po8maa	A spring suit would be adaquate in 60/70 degree water for most surfers. Also keep in mind that springsuits allow you to move more freely than fullsuits. If I were you, I would just try it once before you move to a fullsuit.|`|r1FX4xfMaa	some people feel comfortable in spring suits in the middle of wither. when ever you feel cold / not comfortable, then that's when its time to get a full wetsuit. i like to wear the full suit like most people at about 60 F water temp.|`|IB3vgqwzaa	its up to you really.. I went out in malibu on wed wearing a full 3/2 and booties and was freezing (its about 60 degrees now)  and then some old dude paddles by me wearing just boardshorts and having a blast...<br>  <br>  id say mid-high 60s is time for a full wetsuit unless you have a pretty strong tolerance for the cold.  |`|xal0P1rNaa	You've probably got another couple weeks or so before you really need a full suit.  It really depends upon the air temp though.  I've surfed in a spring suit in VB on Thanksgiving but it was a really warm day. The water will stay in the 60's until early Dec.  <br>  <br>  That said, I wore a full suit today at Croatan, but it was a little chilly out.

hceQURVZaa	Go to a local pool store.  There is a lot more than chlorine thats important.  You need the right amount of calcium, pH, alkalinity, chlorine (or bromine).  You will also want to know how much stabilizer is there.  You get it with stabilized chlorine but too much is bad.  You will probably also want to shock it with chlorine every week or so.  Your pool store should be very helpful.  Chlorine consumption is also affected by water temperature and amount of sunlight.|`|ynj5po8maa	It depends on what type of chlorine and the concentration of the chlorine.|`|iUODWm9Eaa	It depends on the chlorine, if your using liquid chlorine (sodium hypochlorite) its 200 ml/10,000 litres so in your case you would need to add 400mls of liquid chlorine, <br>  If your using granulated chlorine (calcium hypochlorite) its 80grams/ 10,000 litres so for your size pool you will need approx 160 grams of chlorine.<br>  <br>  Buy yourself a test kit and check the P.h. level and keep it around 7.2 with hydrochloric acid if it is too high and sodium bicarbonate (bi-carb soda) if its to low.<br>  <br>  That is all you need to keep the pool clean and safe, But vacuum the pool and keep it leaf and debri free.
ynj5po8maa	An abalone shell is not even on the bottom, so when they suck onto a flat rock, there is a crevice. You stick an abalone iron into the crevice and pull. If you don't get it out on the first try, it will suck onto the rock and it will never come off.

Image knows some wrestling, I mean he does come from a long line of wrestlers (he is cousin to the Rock, Yokozuna, Rikishi, etc.) but he isn't much in tactical wrestling skills. Randy would win because he can handle big guys (he is 6'5) and knows how to slow down and focus on a part of an opponent. You might not know this, but the reason he does so many headlocks and any move that is centered around the head and neck area, is because he is getting (or pretending to be getting) that area of the body primed and ready for his RKO, so that when he finally does hit it they won't get up. Randy will win because he can handle the outside interference and he will be able to outlast the Samoan by tiring him down. Alot of you newbie pro wrestling fans (not talking about you questioner) need to learn that it isn't always the beefy ones that win the match. Sure Batista, Image, Cena, and Lashley look strong but when it comes to tactics, submission, focusing on areas of the body, and so forth they are severely lacking.|`|AA11377900	umaga|`|0c438ab7a48ff501fc6db967b1f4593aaa	Umaga, no brainer|`|1d5b47df8c1a3c7d1cd767eabacdb0dbaa	randy lol omga|`|2e5906dfe7d04649700c6454a8f2156eaa	i'm gonna have to vote for Umaga. Armando Alejandro Estrada at ringside gives Umaga an edge over Randy. and although Randy continues to impress me, even as a heel, by defeating his opponents with minimal dirty tactics (usually without any dirty tactics whatsoever), Umaga has equally impressed me as well with his quick power moves such as his mid-air samoan drop, and his samoan spike that can counter almost any move, whether airborne or ground based. although Randy's RKO can seemingly come from nowhere, Umaga's Samoan Spike can counter the RKO 2 out of 3 times (perhaps even 3 out of 3 times with Estrada's assistance).|`|44fc65e5ac40e0573065800b92972bdaaa	Well little man, I think Umaga would win.

The doctors I have spoken with all agree that the holes in the ears will not close for that 1 hour of play. <br>  However if they insist, I do not make them remove them, but I also do not allow them on the field. <br>  This is from the FIFA laws of the Game, IFAB decision 4.3 on Jewelry.<br>  "All items of jewelry are normally considered dangerous; however, referees should consider carefully any item of clothing or jewelry that is clearly religious or medical in nature and permit it to be worn if it is not dangerous and not likely to provide the player with an unfair advantage. Players may not tape, cover up, or otherwise hide prohibited items. The player must still be prevented from participating in the match if the prohibited item continues to be worn. The willful refusal by a player to remove illegal equipment (including items of jewelry), having been previously warned that such equipment cannot be worn on the field yet continuing to do so, is considered unsporting behavior."|`|fb03370e839bd6ac927376a4c8f976ddaa	Usually in contact sports they make you remove all body jewelry, and don't let you have anything back in, so I'm gonna go with no.|`|dce830be4810349f8c87e0739deb3598aa	soccer players dont wear lip rings only poofs do

c8a7fccbc3a3ba10bf5fd61b819bb9aaaa	The British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith was married to Diana Hart in 1984 & later was divorced from her in 2000. They did have two children: Harry, who is now a professional wrestler, & Georgia.  Sadly, The British Bulldog passed away on May 18, 2002 at the age of 39 in British Columbia. He suffered a heart attack while he was vacationing & according to an autopsy report, it was revealed that past anabolic steroid use<br>  played a part in his death, however no certain reason was ever given. It was apparent that stress, serious injuries, & the use of drugs took its toll on him & before his death, he was training in making a comeback to the ring & resuming his wrestling career. He was born in Golborne, Warrington ( which is now in the Borough of Wigan) England on November 27, 1962.|`|AA10064315	Who cares.

FR9ReZC7aa	Well, i guess it depends on whether or not you are playing fastpitch or slowpitch.  I cant help you out on slowpitch but i can on fastpitch.  In softball the ball is 12 inches big and it thrown underhand to the batter.  The mound is only 40 feet away from homeplate and is flat on the ground.  When the pitcher pitches it she/he starts on the mound and jumps off while swinging the arm with the ball in a circular motion to get momentum.  She/he releases the ball at the hip to go straight over the plate.  Hitting is the same as baseball.  All of the positions are the same but the bases are a shorter distance from home plate.  I am not exactly sure on how much shorter.  The infield is dirt and that is pretty much the basics of softball.  I hope that helps but if you are playing slowpitch then totally disregard this answer.|`|61d1877e50417ccecdab7a953df65181aa	softball is for girls.|`|r75iE7iVaa	you have a bat and a big ball thats called a soft ball. you have a small diamond with 4 bases if you want a lot of action play short stop thats where most girls hit not all though

fb03370e839bd6ac927376a4c8f976ddaa	Armando Benitez has been going down hill, and SF has Tim Lincecum waiting in the wings for that closer chair. Valverde is streaky, but he'll probably be Arizona's guy. David Weathers has no business closing, I don't think he'll hold the chair. I would try and trade Clemens to some sucker for a closer if possible, otherwise, get what you can. I like Jeremy Sowers. I would dump Benitez for Lincecum (if possible), and I would keep an eye on the Cincinnati closer situation and try and get a better closer, or whoever wins that dogfight.|`|1PJvrJSraa	Benitez - hold onto him for now as he is the closer and can be a decent one <br>  <br>  Valverde - hold onto him as well since he is the closer for a new and improved D'backs rotation<br>  <br>  Weathers - get rid of him... he won't hold that job for long and he has never been any good to begin with and he pitches in a hitters ballpark<br>  <br>  Clemens - hold onto him because when he comes back and plays this year he will be one of the top pitchers in the league<br>  <br>  Sowers - get rid of him because there will be about 30 pitchers or so that emerge this year who will be comparable to or better than Sowers...|`|AA11578234	Benitez has the closer job to lose, and he probably will lose it. Valverde is decent, maybe low-30s in saves. Weathers is getting old, Bill Bray will take his job soon. Clemens is a free agent, he may not pitch much this season. Sowers is the AL's Rich Hill in my opinion. I'd keep Valverde and Sowers, maybe Weathers and Benitez, and dump Clemens.|`|UZA4GBr8aa	Valverde:  He's being drafted in the upper 190's.  He went with the 10.10 pick in my 16-team H2H league.  He'll probably save between 20-25 games this season.  The D-backs could keep him on a short leash with a once-successful closer in Jorge Julio on the roster.  The D-backs are an improving, young team with a decent rotation (Johnson, Webb, Davis) so the save opportunities could be many.<br>  <br>  Weathers:  He's a little "weathered" and the Reds may have trouble winning games this season.  I like Valverde a little better than Weathers.  He's going in the low 300s in drafts.  He went at 15.09 in my 16-team league.  I'd guess he saves between 15-20 games.  Todd Coffey is being groomed as the closer of the future, and solid reliever Mike Stanton could also close out games.<br>  <br>  Benitez:  He's also a little long in the tooth but the Giants really have no other options.  I haven't heard any reports of Benitez being shopped.  I know that was the case at the end of last season, but not here in the start to this season.  He went with the 14.07 pick and is going on average in the 260's.  He'll probably save at least 20 games for the Giants.  <br>  <br>  Clemens:  I think you have to keep him on your roster.  If he does come back, he'll be putting up top-5 pitching numbers.  Perhaps you try shopping him around to see if you can find an owner that is off to a slow start.  They may panic and accept an offer for Clemens even if he's not signed yet.  <br>  <br>  Sowers:  He's being drafted in the 270's, and went at 16.01 in my 16-team league.  As the third starter for a Cleveland team that should win some games, you gotta figure he'll win 10-15 games.  If that works for you, and there's nothing better on your wire, keep him.<br>  <br>  Depending on the size of your league, it looks like it's probably rather large if the best player is Pelfrey.  I would keep all of those players, as they certainly have large-league value.|`|ik2QKnioaa	Benitez, Valverde, and Sower all seem to be decent risks to hold on to (definitely a high risk/ high reward situation).  I would hold onto them until they either breakout or flop, by a month into the season you'll know which side you're getting and can replace them if necessary (and should be able to get from the FA pool approximately what you'd get in trade for them now).<br>  <br>  I put David Weathers and Roger Clemens in a different boat for separate reasons. <br>  <br>  Clemens has done nothing to get ready for this season and during the NYY-CIN game last week came onto the broadcast and explained how he was nowhere near the level of preparation he was this time last year. From that interview and other things he has said I seriously doubt he will put on a uniform this year.  I would shop him around, but you're likely to find no takers. If you can't trade him by mid-late April and the word hasn't changed I'd drop him for a FA.<br>  <br>  Weathers on the other hand is going to suit up, but he's probably one of the most insecure closers you can have. Coffee, Bray, and Stanton are all in the running for his job, Dustin Hermanson (2005 Closer for the CWS) is in camp and healthy, and Eddie Guardado is slated to return sometime mid-season.  I would try and get something for him, otherwise hold onto him or scour the wavier wire/FA for another closer.

2a94e7935d0d7794a0d1ced7626b5067aa	This question is sooooooooo dumb, and old!  The only reason he is such a threat as a runner is because he has the ball and is allowed to throw it.  Therefore the defense must cover the recievers, where as if he were a running back he couldn't throw it and would get swarmed by the D and couldn't make the magnificent plays he does now as a QB.  You also have to remember he dominated and took the Falcons to their conference championship game his first year.  Then dumb Mora Jr. came and put in a West Coast offense and screwed Vick, now the offense is back to what it was, he will be unstoppable this season, MARK MY WORDS!!!!!|`|CZpWPCP0aa	If he is gonna stay in the NFL he needs to remain at QB, he does not have the durability to go head up with a defender 10-20 times a game and he is so selfish I dought we would do any backfield blocking for the QB that took his job.|`|TwP56Rhsaa	They should keep him at QB.  They also should help him re-focus on the game of football and not the life of Mike Vick.|`|mcSiBz1taa	michael vick should be a qb. he put up decent numbers last year and should improve under petrino. however, if he doesn't improve a lot this season and the falcons dont' make the playoffs his days are numbered. i'd give it two more season before they get rid of him if he's not productive. also look at how many dropped passed and how much the receivers in atlants sucked last year. the defense was also pretty bad. not all of it was vick's fault.|`|99fc975d98e89b65ad7e9528766ccf42aa	Yes, he's fast. Does that mean he should be a running back? No. He's not big enough, not strong enough, and could not take the hits some running backs take. He is injury prone as it is...and he would not last as a Running Back. Keep him at QB.|`|HvuvH6vSaa	He wouldnt make a very good RB. The only way I could see that working out is if they used him like Reggie Bush. He would be good for trick plays, screens, and a few running plays. I dont think he can hold up though he already has had problems with injuries.|`|mMRGtHnUaa	he needs to be a WR hes fast he has quick feet he would dominate in the slot pos.|`|wa5wOaqtaa	in a perfect world vick would be kicked out of nfl|`|c0409627d09f8c2f38561958fd52a476aa	You Falcons fans sure are hard on the guy. He got it into his receivers' hands last year. It's just that getting the ball in their hands is not the same as completing a pass. This year, maybe they'll put in a hook-and-ladder play, so he can pass the ball and then go down-field and catch it.
OA0Z3l8Gaa	Im a chargers fan, you're not the only one but i agree that Norv Turner is going to ruin their chance on going back to the playoffs.|`|TSEqHvS4aa	there's a CHARGER fan in hawaii. we're a rare breed out here. besides my son(5) and my pittsburgh-steeler-fan friend's son(8) that i got to be a CHARGER fan, i only know about a handful of us. as far as norv turner goes, give the man a chance. his record as a head coach may not be something to proud of, but look where he was coaching. he installed the offense that the bolts are running now and he has even more talent on the team then he ever had before. before the start of last season, how many of us thought the CHARGERS were going to be 14-2 under "rookie" quarterback Philip Rivers? GO BOLTS!!!!|`|6wq1slwJaa	I'm not a chargers fan but I agree 100% with you about Norve Turner--HUGE mistake bringing him on as Head coach.  What were they thinking, Marty takes them to the conference championship and has a record of 14-2 and they can him; please tell me why.  14-2 when did that become a record that could justify canning  your head coach?  They won't know the damage and mistake that they made until the season is over this upcoming year and they won't even be in the playoff picture.  I would love to see them go 2-14 just for Marty's sake, sorry ; I know your a fan and that won't make you happy.  Norve Turner will totally ruin the San Diego Chargers , you are correct on that!!!!!!|`|365031f4ae29289add6d978784478b47aa	My wifes a SD fan living on the East Coast.  So they are two of you.  <br>  <br>  Even Turner can't screw up the Chargers they are too talented.  You're right he is not a good head coach, but he is a good when it comes to the offense.  So hopefully he lets Cottrell run the Defense.|`|TwP56Rhsaa	Well, I live in San Diego, and the feeling around here is that Norv may not screw up the chargers, as much as the fact that they have 6 new coaches on staff including Turner.  So we will see, but seriously it's a running game anyway, hand off to LT and score touchdowns.|`|iccJJGseaa	i live in Nj but i LOVE the charagers. The chargers should let A.J.

He's the mastermind of the whole Charger organziation.|`|Q8dTVuiHaa	i agree... im not a charger fan, but im from waco where ladainian is from so i always root for them...

SxcRIVcMaa	I love soccer and so i have a few tips for you. Easiest ones to do are the ball touches ( you just keep touching the ball with the tips of your feet) this helps your foot eye co-ordination and puts you in shape. Also, riding a bike is a great way to get your legs going without actually running. Start running nightly, but do this, run a lap then walk a lap. Also, LOTS OF WATER!!! A good goalie drill is to just have someone throw a ball at you in different directions so you can practice diving and staying on your feet. And a few basics that might come in handy are the dribling drills and start passing with a buddy. Passing is a key thing to master. Purchase cheap cones at your dollar store so you can practice your dribbling. Well if you want more ideas just let me know. Hope this helps and good luck with your team! p.s. always keep your eye on the ball! =] oh one more thing......start running with high knees ( high knees=puting your knees high when you are running)|`|Qemwpzwzaa	come and play with me and my mates at weekend..<br>  it will be laugh,<br>  don't worry we wont blast the ball too hard!<br>  <br>  its fun goin in goal..<br>  even though i play outfied, i enjoy diving around in the net tryna save all the hard shots..|`|60c600aaa29f6c3994fd852bbf22f913aa	Ok first thing you have to do is practice how to dive for the ball and protect the goal at all time never slack off and dont play around<br>  <br>  Next is how to jump high so the ball wont get in when its a highball!!<br>  <br>  now for some drills do the ladder it helps you become faster with your running then practice your volley kicks make them hard but not too hard so it wont go out.<br>  <br>  Then your throwing of the ball must be hard enough to reach the selected team member you want to throw it to that throw should be high fast and hard enough not to make your opponent get it!!<br>  <br>  And remember have fun and dont let anyone score a goal through you!!<br>  <br>  Trust me im a team captain in 3 different varsity soccer teams so i know what im talkingabout.
UoT86gbiaa	Dan Johnson and Eric Byrnes are historically streaky.  Wait for them to go cold, and plug both in... and since they've had hot streaks, they'll almost certainly be available.<br>  <br>  Bobby Abreu has been horrid all season.  Just be careful of him turning it around.  JD Drew is awful and shows little hope of improving.  Mike Piazza was ice cold before going on the DL, and may not be 100% coming back.  Adam Everett is still starting in Houston, despite very little production for several years.  Jason Kendall is below the Mendoza line for the season.  Adam Kennedy, reigning World Series MVP, is hitting about .222.  That should be a good start.|`|fb03370e839bd6ac927376a4c8f976ddaa	Draft Josh Barfield, get a lot of KC Royals pitchers, Nationals field players, and Jarrod Saltalamacchia (just because of his name, he's a backup though).

Ne ho visti tanti di talenti perdersi per delle mancanze nel carattere. Nel caso di Giovinco, non lo so, vedremo col tempo.

Recomendaría ir al NFL.com|`|7d619e60dfcd934f887f49289e999f99aa	La neta encontrar chamarras de la NFL aqui en Mexico esta ca?on, y si las encuentras quiza no sean tan variadas en cuanto a equipos y modelos, pero algunos lugares donde puedes encontrar es en las tiendas donde venden todo para el americano, NERIAS es una buena opcion si vives al sur del D.F., aunq tambien hay una tienda en PLAZA GALERIAS, junto a las tiendas de computo, donde encuentras buenas cosas aparte de chamarras. <br>  <br>  Pero para ser sinceros te recomiendo que hagas tu compra en la pagina de tu equipo favorito ya que en estos lugares son muy caras las cosas, te digo porq yo he comprado sudaderas en E.U. y cuando las he visto aqui en Mexico, si es que las encuentro, estan a mas del doble que yo las compré.<br>  <br>  Ademas que si compras en internet, si es cierto que tendras que pagar el envio, pero tendras una prenda original y reciente.<br>  <br>  Espero te sirva este consejo y mucha suerte!!

Pour ces deux types de billard c'est la même queue qu'il te faut. Je te parle avec mes connaissances que l'on m'a donné ( C'est à dire en grande partie grace à ce fameux mistermo ) ...alors le diamèter de ton procédé ( le bout de la queue si tu préfère ) entre 8 et 9.5 mm max...perso j'ai une 9 mm et ?a va très bien...il te faut une queue 3/4, c'est à dire qu'elle se coupe en 2 parties (une faisant un quart de ta queue ( le fut) et l'autre 3 quart (la flèche ) ).<br>  Ensuite pour des conseils de site..les deux principaux : kozoom et supréme...se sont les meilleur site ou tu pourras trouver ton bonheur au niveau du billard...que se soit pour les queues, billard, accessoires etc...<br>  Donc voilà ensuite pour se qui est de l'américain et du francais... les procédés sont bien plus gros : entre 11 et 13 mm en général donc il y a quand même des différences...ensuite pour le prix je pense qu'à partir de 40-50 euro tu commence à avoir une certaine qualité en tant que débutant je pense que c'est pas mal .....<br>  Voilà en espérant t'avoir aidé !!!<br>  <br>  Bon billard !!!!|`|6bMAh1ESaa	Il faut que tu choisisses bien ton bois, trop sec ou trop vert ?a tiendra pas en main et manquera de précisions pour viser le bon endroit, mais le tout est une question de doigté|`|S6X9uwLnaa	Soigne qu'elle tienne bien en mains et ne pas trop l'agiter parce qu'alors, bonjour les dégas|`|ehnSfPAAaa	On a tous (et toutes) ses habitudes, tout depend de la stratégie.....Que cherche t'on à faire et comment?<br>  Personnellement je suis pour essayer des tailles différentes lorsque je ne joue pas en compétition.

zBlA2SwNaa	Pues la vaina esta como que muy re?ida, mi oponion no es basada en fanatismo hacia algun equipo.<br>  <br>  Los lakers son un excelente equipo y mas aun con Gasol, fisher y Binum al lado de Kobe, pero yo creo que les falta mas trayectoria para poder ganar los playoffs.<br>  <br>  Mi postulado es San Antonio, si, no tienen un juego vistoso péro si efectivo y complementado en equipo, pero tampoco la tendran nda facil por New Orleans y si es el caso contra Boston.<br>  <br>  Yo soy muy aficionado de los Nuggets, ojalá lleguen por lo menos a finales de conferencia, aunque no apuesto mucho por ellos porque los Lakers los pueden eliminar facilmente.|`|780871ef1c3e3b2805e8a78a3d32fc4faa	san antonio|`|DDp3tw5Taa	lakers,lakers,lakers|`|HaZr5O2Waa	PSRS MI LA FINAL VA A SER LAKERS VS CELTICS<br>  <br>  NOES Q A MI NO MEGUSTEN LOS LAKERS<br>  ES MAS SON MI 2o EQUIPO PREFERIDO<br>  PERO EL PRIMERO SON LOS BOSTON<br>  ASI Q<br>  <br>  KOBE 4 MVP<br>  <br>  CELTICS 4 CHAMPS|`|MdlRKt0zaa	la verda que gane S.A.<br>  suerte XD|`|ykMDT5BMaa	mmmm no c yo dsolo kiero vr celtics lakers en la final y voi a qedar muy satisfecho si no es esa la final no lo vere|`|MsCm6t3qaa	Los Lakers precisamente.|`|99e98f91bf10f7c81dc5881c812e64bdaa	lakers|`|5ab58c48ca9fcbe0070f54562f5c75f9aa	Ay mi ni?a...no sabes de basquet tampoco<br>  <br>  Boston será<br>  =)|`|MVnD5nIPaa	100% Lakers!!!!!!!!!!!! no hay mejor!|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Le voy a los Lakers!|`|SeUFPFazaa	Los Campeones de la NBA: San Antonio Spurs.
