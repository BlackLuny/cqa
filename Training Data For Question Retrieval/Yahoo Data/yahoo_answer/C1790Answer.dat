8yE2sYGeaa	A lot of people were afraid that Bush was going to invade Iran. Even the president of iran was on the alert for that|`|vHQsz8HHaa	no one cares about what that filthy war criminal says anymore.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	I wasn't one of them. By the time He got around to thinking about it, the Economy was shot, & no one supported him anymore... So He didn't have a leg to stand on...|`|PVfV1a8Kaa	Thank God he didn't!|`|i7oHTo9haa	I never heard Bush say that.     Iran is definitely a problem.  Nobody wants to upset the status quo in the Middle East so caution is exerted.  Eventually we are going to have to act and act fiercely.  There is no person in their right mind that would allow Iran to have nukes.  Even half the Middle East doesn't want Iran to have nukes so it really isn't just a US-Israel Euro issue.  The West just has to plan carefully what to do.  Give Obama a chance to sweet talk and set up the timing perfectly.|`|LWzrCu5caa	The comment was he was going to take out Iran's nuclear assets,  not invade.   He did neither.    So he left it to Obama,  who will do nothing.   In 3-4 years Iran will have a nuke.  And Obama's response is that we have to give them what they want so they do not use it.  But use it they will.   They call Israel the Little Satan and the USA the Big Satan.   One or the other is going to be a target.|`|plA56SWqaa	dude bush is old news.|`|WNB4Vojsaa	he is on his way now.|`|qdep99QWaa	bush is a *** he is what led us to this bad economy|`|uFiJaR7vaa	Is Obama doing a bait and switch on Americans, the same way Bush did?

Notice how the rhetoric hit a peak, then quickly died?    That is because people far smarter then Bush and his nation building finally told him the truth.    Peace  Jim    .|`|7J1D1IyRaa	It was the economy. Had he done so, gas prices would have sky rocketed and we would be in worse condition that we are in now.|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	Well, there was never any plan to invade Iran, but an attack on Iran was certainly threatened.    Probably because sanity prevailed. We were already bogged down in two wars, one of which (Iraq) was very vulnerable to Iranian attack. They could have fired thousands of rockets at US bases in Iraq. And disruption of oil in the Persian Gulf could have caused all sorts of horrible problems.    If there's any one reason the attack was called off, it was the mess in Georgia. There is good reason to believe that Israel in particular had arranged to use Georgian airbases for an attack on Iran, the Russians called our bluff during the crisis and made it clear they had drawn a line. Since they had already said that they would consider an attack on Iran (Iran has observer status in the SCO, the Chinese Russian alliance) to be an attack on Iran, an attack on Iran wasn't worth risking a war with Russia.    Us peasants will never really know though, finding out why governments do what they do often takes decades to be revealed (if ever.) Maybe someone high in the Bush administration will reveal how why decided not to attack in their memoirs decades from now, but at the moment it's all speculation.|`|PTObqYcMaa	hmmm idk never heard that|`|y43XQwUuaa	OH WELL.|`|WKdGhRYcaa	***** please|`|HvAuNK46aa	nopeies oppies ope|`|ifVqaPsxaa	i dont think so...|`|UwhyTsCKaa	Actually obama said that he would be willing to invade Iran in a debate with McCain.

If you wish that Arabs had chosen the way of non-violence in resisting, then why are you here fomenting this. You are trying to say that Jew do not belong there? When we all know and you know this too, Israel belongs to the Jews not the Arabs. Like Gandhi said, England to the English, France to the French and now I add Israel to the Jews, and sorry but Palestine is a city within Israel, the Romans changed it's name after destroying the last temple in Israel in an attempt to erase anything that had to do with Judea.|`|zlMsi7zhaa	If Arabs lay down their weapons, there will be peace in the region,  if Israelis lay down their weapons, there will be no Israel.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	jews inhabited the areas disputed for thousands of years.jerusalem was until recently mainly jewish.  israel is a legally established democratic country formed after the 2nd world war by the league of nations.  the arabs supported hitler and still attempt to follow his lead.  it is the palestinians who should join their natural homelands of jordan and egypt as the jews are absolutely entitled to their homeland.  As was seen in 200/1 when arafat refused a sate and chose terror instead (intifada).peace i not wanted , the palestinians are merely pawns to garner more   the only thing radicals and the brainwashed want is the elimination of israel altogether.  only lunatics support this view. why is there RESISTENCE against Israel, who are they threatening, like iran.   leave the jews alone and the arabs may also begin to prosper instead of waging perpetual war with a country that offers only peace.  shadow of the british gun, GIVE me a break. ghandi was a little biased, no?  even Obama will not get terrorists to change their myopic destructive ways.  in the meantime the people of gaza suffer and live in fear of hamas  and their miserable lives.|`|cNVTtkgmaa	Ghandi was wrong.|`|NI0cNU22aa	He said it in 1938, genius.

The cartoon is implying that the high price of oil gave the Russians the strength to threaten NATO while they rolled over Georgia. It's a simplistic one-sided take on the crisis, since it puts the onus of the aggression on Russia, when it was the ill advised Georgian attack (Not to mention the USA's foolish attempt to get Georgia into NATO) that started the whole mess.|`|JaTjoLNlaa	there not fighting over oil. there fighting cause Georgia attacked south ossetia, witch is under russias protection since they're russian citizens do to passports handed out a while ago.     ukraine armed georgia cause they also wanna be part of nato. nato isn;t falling apart, but there on edge with stupid decisions and negotiations.     nato wanted to put anti missile barriers in poland and russia said "if you do that we'll nuke the sh*t out of them"     and if that happens then nato will have to fight russia, and most nato aligned countries will back down cause they don't want ww3 on there soil.   so yeah.. cool little thing going on between them.

So, yes, if there is peace, terrorists would have no reason to keep fighting and they will have no support. .|`|emJ79qagaa	Israelis are the terrorists in the Palestine/Israel conflict. Remember, Hamas is the breed of this occupation that has been going on for about 7 decades now. When people are oppressed they are like a lid on hot boiling water, it fuses over. Israel came in, Israel took their homes, land, and stopped their businesses, Israel forced them out into Jordan, Syria, Egypt, European countries, etc. If they are not lucky to have escaped they would have been forced into Gaza or the West Bank with horrible conditions. Israel killed over 3,000,000 Palestinians, They are committing their own little Genocide. Its sick. So when you blame Hamas for being terrorists, remember, we would have done the same thing. Israel is not too innocent either.|`|i7oHTo9haa	There isn't going to be peace anytime soon until some other issues are addressed.  One cannot just make 2 men shake hands and sign a paper and so okay I love you. The terrorists are never going to give up their cause unless they are defeated. They never learned how to love, 94% of Palestinian children are victims of domestic violence in their own homes, 77.69% Palestinians voted in a terroristic regime that wants to destroy Israel, Europe and Both Americas, and 84% of Palestinians favor killing innocent civilians and danced in the streets after it occured (Yeshiva Massacre, 9/11)  You think one would be able to reason with Bin Laden?  No, they have no reasoning capability except in their own sick minds and that sickness has affected the general Palestinian population.    This war on terrorism isn't just between Israel and the Palestinians.  Syria is the dominant force between the whole conflict since day one.  Syria invented the PLO.  The PLO was designed to regain former "Greater Syrian Empire" land. They are doing what Saddam did with Kuwait, trying to make his empire Mesopotamia. Syria wants Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel.    You cannot have peace with Palestinians until the Syrian-Iranian issue is resolved.  Palestinians have major violence issues that is inherent in their culture it will not be solved by getting two men to shake hands and sign a paper.  Just keep the Palestinians in "check" until the other issues are resolved.     PLO was kicked out of Jordan and Lebanon already.  Arafat said the road to Palestine is thru Joniah (Lebanon) They used a Jordanian soldier's head as soccer practice and tried to assassinate King Hussein. Nothing but mega war with these PLO terrorists when will the world realize what's going on and stop blaming Israel?  When will the world realize it isn't about Gaza strip, WB and the pre-determination of a Palestinian people?  These people were birthed by Syria to fight wars.  They are Syrians not Palestinians. They are warriors that one can never have peace with.    Iran fuels the flames because he is the spearhead of the Islamic Revolution that started in 1979.  He wants total instability in the Middle East so Syria (his ally) can gain control and together they can spread their Islamofascist regimes.  Iran wants nukes, supports Hamas and Syria and these radicals have already requested a nuclear suicide bomber.    You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967.

h25jWi35aa	I prefer to get my news online, specifically from    http://www.dailysource.org    I go to this website because it is easy to use and understand, I am able to get news from all around the world and the biggest/ most important stories are the first things you see.    I like getting recommendations for a trustworthy news source. If someone recommends it then I am likely to check it out and then will determine my own opinion. I expect news sources to be up to date and have news that is important to me. Which I find all that at The Daily Source.    Its hard to say if news sources are more credible these days then in the years past. On one side, we have more access to information and are able to get more quicker but at the same time, these days some news stations and sites generally make their personal opinions clear.

See below.    http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/23/news/eco...    However, the Senate could alter this or pass a different bill that could once again be changed in a joint conference committee. Although there has been no active talk of a tax rebate, this is unlikely at this point because there is a political debate in Congress as to whether tax rebates actually stimulate the economy (when people use the money to pay down debt versus buying things).|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Yup... -But only Half-way.

64SObnr5aa	The supply of money is being radically increased with all the huge bailouts.    The natural order of events, since money is becoming less scarce is for prices to go up.  It really has more to do with supply and demand.  The economy is being saturated with money.    If the FED continues to print more money and put it into our fractional reserve system, and if it becomes to saturated, then we could go into hyper inflation, where a hamburger costs $100.  You may end up making $200,000 a year, but so will everyone else, so you really gain nothing except we can no longer compete in the global economy because the whole house of cards that has been created by our money system has come tumbliing down and the world has said, phuk the dollar standard, we're going over to the Yuan, or Euro, or whatever currency is stable.    So who makes our money?  Well, it ain't the federal government  Then who is it?  As close as the money in your pocket.    Look at the back of a dollar bill  It says Federal Reserve System  How many of you know that system is privately owned?  How many of you know that the Federal Reserve System is controlled by a few banks and a handful of very rich people?  How many of you know that the chairman of the Federal Reserve System is probably the most powerful man on the planet?    The Federal Reserve System controls our money supply  Prints our money  Controls our Interest rates  encourages you to be in debt  lends money to our government while you the tax payer are paying interest on that debt.  That our money is not backed by anything tangible, such as gold or silver, but only backed with a promise.    In short, they control just about every aspect of your life, your money, your credit cards, your mortgage, your car loan, student loans, your retirment, etc.  Including having their hands in getting us involved in money making wars.    The smartest thing I ever did was chose to live debt free about 20 years ago.  It is amazing how much of our money is eaten up by the Federal Reserve System, and how much more disposable income I had because I made the right choice.    And more information about the federal reserve system:  http://www.apfn.org/apfn/reserve.htm  And this audio from Congressman Ron Paul  http://www.apfn.net/pogo/M001I0604251938...

AA10487691	Depends on which war you want to learn about. General media sources like CNN or The New York Times will tell you about world events. If you want to learn about specific wars, maybe try English-language websites of regional newspapers. For instance, if you wanted to learn about the recent conflict in the Middle East, you could try going to the website of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
EOz7Et9iaa	Obama does NOT support late term abortions.  Check out the link below.  However, I would mention to your parents that your Civics teacher is discussing abortion in the wrong class.  School is not a podium for personal belief.|`|PkBMMvqTaa	I think you mean the eighth month. 3rd trimester. Yes, He even said that if a baby who was aborted, actually lives, then we should not do anything to help it. It is to be left to die.....|`|0hT85XLzaa	No, it's not true.     Look it up and embarras your stupid teacher and make her look dumb when you present her the facts|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	Yes he does.  But Obama's record on abortion is extreme. He opposed the ban on partial-birth abortion --|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	ya he does and that is totally brutal and wrong.|`|AA12337052	Yes, he does. It is hard to find info on it because the media will try to hide that info as much as they can.    Here is some info I found:  Obama's record on abortion is extreme. He opposed the ban on partial-birth abortion -- a practice a fellow Democrat, the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, once called "too close to infanticide." Obama strongly criticized the Supreme Court decision upholding the partial-birth ban. In the Illinois state Senate, he opposed a bill similar to the Born Alive Infant Protection Act, which prevents the killing of infants mistakenly left alive by abortion. And now Obama has oddly claimed he would not want his daughters to be "punished with a baby" because of a crisis pregnancy -- hardly a welcoming attitude toward new life.  There is additional info at the link below|`|cDpu1Dxyaa	there is no such thing as an eighth trimester (a trimester means three...)    if you mean 8th month abortions, then no. nobody in the world would support that and still be looked upon favorably, not even the president.|`|1cL06jyTaa	i have no idea  but 8th grade teachers   are often full of c.rap|`|VG8IVkB4aa	gObama!   8th grade sucks @$$ D:|`|7823c88a25415e1b637f82bb9e175c56aa	There is no "8th trimester" of a pregnancy...just 3.  Try doing your search under partial birth abortion...advanced pregnancy abortion|`|RbOkdnLeaa	if u did not find anything it is not true|`|fRcmDyxMaa	Well, I don't know if there is a such thing as 8th trimester abortions, but I do know that he supports late term abortions and has even signed a bill to allow FEDERAL FUNDS our tax dollars, to support the funding of planned parenthood... Your eight grade civic teacher has all the right to discuss this with the class because she is sharing public events and history, so don't let anyone tell you she doesn't have the right to discuss this...it is your right to know what the president does...I suggest your parents watch the news from Fox or  BBC America they take the liberal slant off the news that many others use..

You should just get off your mighty high horse and do your own homework.. It takes about 20 minutes to watch his speech on youtube, or if you are deaf you can look at the text of his speech. Stop trying to get everyone else to do your work for you and start doing your own work. You should be old enough that you can look it up for yourself. My opinion is not the same opinion as yours. it may be different issues that his speech raised for me.|`|xSu5A4eYaa	emotional and awesome!!|`|3SJGGOORaa	I though it was great.|`|HkHYd6ndaa	i thought it sucked|`|oWAUn0leaa	Frankly it made my feel turned on. His wife was hot. In terms of things he raised? well the first answer answers this question too. The greatest challenge for him is the same one for every american: eat right and live a healthy lifestyle.  I think the most important issue for me is his stance on the issues. Issues that I care about.|`|6f99a7973a2e8b7b15ef800cf6e14fefaa	Well , I  thought  the  speach  was  really  great  . It  really  touched  me    and  Obama  seems  like  a  great  Pressident .  Still it  made  me  wonder  if  he  can  really  remain the  good  president  over  time  and  he  won't  be  corrupted  by  power  like  the  other  Presidents  . He  hust  seems  too nice  . The  greatest  Challence  , will probably  be  fixing  the  crisis  America is  in  now  .  I  just  hope  he's  going  to  prove  himself  by  his  actions  , as  the  great  President  he  seems  to  be  and  talks about  being .
AA10274297	Any stimulus payment this year is unlikely to be in the form of a single check like last year.    President Obama has indicated that he would prefer to spread out any stimulus payments by reducing the amount of tax withholding, rather than sending out lump-sum checks. So instead of getting a check for $500, you might see your paycheck go up by $42 per month because less tax will be deducted.|`|igYM91eRaa	I would rather have one lump sum!

What else can they do.  Too bad the media is biased and only shows what Israel is doing.|`|7geUgdqaaa	Even GANDHI, who dedicated his whole life to non-violent resistence, SUPPORTED the ARAB RESISTENCE. He said in 1938: "Palestine (which includes present-day "Israel") belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs. What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any moral code of conduct.     Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home. It is wrong for the Jews to enter Palestine under the shadow of the British gun. A religious act cannot be performed with the aid of the bayonet or the bomb.     I wish the Arabs had chosen the way of non-violence in resisting what they rightly regarded as an unwarrantable encroachment upon their country. But according to the accepted canons of right and wrong, NOTHING CAN BE SAID AGAINST THE ARAB RESISTENCE IN THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING ODDS."    http://www.kamat.com/mmgandhi/mideast.ht...    ALBERT EINSTEIN and BERTRAND RUSSELL (one of 20th century's top ranking mathematician, philosopher, historian and social-activist) stated: Israel is an illegitimate, Fascist, Terrorist state. http://www.newdemocracyworld.org/Einstei... For Russell's statement go to http://www.corax.com/bookshelf/page.html Click Russell's "Various Writings" Then click "On Israel and Bombing"    In short:    Russell: "Israel has expanded by force of arms. After every stage in this expansion Israel has appealed to "reason" and has suggested "negotiations". This is the traditional role of the imperial power, because it wishes to consolidate with the least difficulty what it has already taken by violence. The aggression committed by Israel must be condemned because every expansion is an experiment to discover how much more aggression the world will tolerate.    The tragedy of the people of Palestine is that their country was "given" by a foreign Power to another people for the creation of a new State. How much longer is the world willing to endure this spectacle of wanton cruelty? It is abundantly clear that the refugees have every right to the homeland from which they were driven, and the denial of this right is at the heart of the continuing conflict. No people anywhere in the world would accept being expelled en masse from their own country; how can anyone require the people of Palestine to accept a punishment which nobody else would tolerate?    We are frequently told, "We must sympathize with Israel because of the suffering of the Jews in Europe at the hands of the Nazis." What Israel is doing today cannot be condoned, and to invoke the horrors of the past to justify those of the present is gross hypocrisy."     Albert Einstein and other prominent Jews wrote a letter to the New York Times, December 4, 1948, denouncing Menachem Begin, a future prime minister of Israel as a FASCIST, who is highly regarded by many contemporary Israelis, including those in the Government. They wrote:     "Among the most disturbing political phenomena of our times is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the "Freedom Party" (Tnuat Haherut), a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal, to the NAZI and FASCIST parties. It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a TERRORIST, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.     The current visit of Menachem Begin, leader of this ("Freedom") party, to the United States is obviously calculated to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States.   Today they speak of freedom, democracy and anti-imperialism, whereas until recently they openly preached the doctrine of the FASCIST STATE. It is in its actions that the TERRORIST PARTY portrays its real character; from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future.     A shocking example was their behavior in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. This village, off the main roads and surrounded by Jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off Arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. On April 9 (The New York Times), TERRORIST BANDS attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants - 240 men, women, and children - and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem."     To read the whole letter please go to newdemocracyworld.org/Einstein.htm     Albert Einstein said in 1920: "It has been clearly proclaimed that we are not seeking to create a political society, but our aim is a cultural one in the widest sense of the word."

Obama does not like being criticized and he wants to shut up Rush and Hannity.   I think he will try to use the old "fairness doctrine" to do it.    A civilian security force as powerful as the US military. Obama said it and I think he will try it.   The question is,  will they wear uniforms like the SS or go plain clothes like the KGB or Gestapo?

On June 20, 2008, Congress's biggest telecom disability rights advocate introduced new legislation that would, among other provisions, extend close captioning to some Internet video. Edward Markey's (D-MA) "21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2008" (H.R. 6320) covers about a dozen areas.      The law says that 18 months after its enactment, the Federal Communications Commission must set up regulations that include "an appropriate schedule of deadlines for the provision of closed captioning of video programming distributed to the public over the Internet."   http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/...|`|AA10796494	I have wondered that same thing for a long time.

8kek6Nqpaa	nope, sorry|`|JSjBecVHaa	10 Reasons to Whack Obama's Stimulus Plan  January 27, 2009 02:10 PM ET | James Pethokoukis | Permanent Link | Print   Some people are going to oppose President Obama's ginormous stimulus package just because they're on a different political team. But when you look at the economic evidence, it sure seems like an economic recovery package that's heavy on government spending and light on tax cuts is just the opposite of what we should be doing right now. Try this closing argument on for size:    1) A 2005 study by Andrew Mountford and Harald Uhlig "analyzed three types of policy shocks: a deficit-financed spending increase, a balanced budget spending increase (financed with higher taxes) and a deficit-financed tax cut, in which revenues increase but government spending stays unchanged. We found that a deficit-spending shock stimulates the economy for the first 4 quarters but only weakly compared to that for a deficit-financed tax cut." In other words, FDR vs. Clinton vs. Reagan, Reagan wins.    2) Harvard economist Robert Barro looked at the multiplier effect of World War II military spending -- supposedly the Mother of All Stimulus Plans and found that "wartime production siphoned off resources from other economic uses  there was a dampener, rather than a multiplier." Barro prefers eliminating the corporate income tax to massive government spending.    3) Alberto Alesina of Harvard and Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago want to adress the fear and confidence issue by creating "the incentive for people to take more risk and move their savings from government bonds to risky assets. There is no better way to encourage this than a temporary elimination of the capital-gains tax for all the investments begun during 2009 and held for at least two years."    4) An initial CBO analysis found that a mere $26 billion out of $274 billion in infrastructure spending, just 7 percent, would be delivered into the economy by next fall. An update determined that just 64 percent of the stimulus would reach the economy by 2011.    5) University of Chicago economist and Nobel laureate Gary Becker doubts whether all this stimulus spending will do much to lower unemployment: "For one thing, the true value of these government programs may be limited because they will be put together hastily, and are likely to contain a lot of political pork and other inefficiencies. For another thing, with unemployment at 7% to 8% of the labor force, it is impossible to target effective spending programs that primarily utilize unemployed workers, or underemployed capital. Spending on infrastructure, and especially on health, energy, and education, will mainly attract employed persons from other activities to the activities stimulated by the government spending. The net job creation from these and related spending is likely to be rather small. In addition, if the private activities crowded out are more valuable than the activities hastily stimulated by this plan, the value of the increase in employment and GDP could be very small, even negative."    6) Christina Romer, the new head of the Council of Economic Advisers, coauthored a paper in which the following was written about taxes: "Tax increases appear to have a very large, sustained, and highly significant negative impact on output. Since most of our exogenous tax changes are in fact reductions, the more intuitive way to express this result is that tax cuts have very large and persistent positive output effects." And former Bush economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey tack on this addendum: "The macroeconomic benefits of tax cuts can be two to three times larger than common estimates of the benefits related to spending increases. The relative advantage of tax cuts over spending is even clearer when the recession is centered on the household balance sheet."    7) Economists Susan Woodward and Robert Hall find that the multiplier effect from infrastructure spending maybe just 1-for-1, less than that 3-to-1 ratio for tax cuts that Romer found: "We believe that the one-for-one rule derived from wartime increases in military spending would also apply to increases in infrastructure spending in a stimulus package. We should not count on any inducement of higher consumption from the infrastructure stimulus."    8) Economist John Taylor thinks it better to let the Federal Reserve deal with the short-term problems in the economy, while fiscal policy should attend to long-term issues: "In the current context of the U.S. economy, it seems best to let fiscal policy have its main countercyclical impact through the automatic stabilizer ... It seems hard to improve on this performance with a more active discretionary fiscal policy, and an activist discretionary fiscal policy might even make the job of monetary authorities more difficult. It would be appropriate in the present American context, for discretionary fiscal policy to be saved explicitly for longer-term issues, requiring less frequent changes. Exam    9) Massive stimulus didn't work in the Great Depression. As this Heritage Foundation study notes: "After the stock market collapse in 1929, the Hoover Administration increased federal spending by 47 percent over the following three years. As a result, federal spending increased from 3.4 percent of GDP in 1930 to 6.9 percent in 1932 and reached 9.8 percent by 1940. That same year-- 10 years into the Great Depression--America's unemployment rate stood at 14.6 percent." Same goes for Japan and its Great Stagnation of the 1990s.    10) Olivier Blanchard, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, coauthored a paper which found "that both increases in taxes and increases in government spending have a strong negative effect on private investment spending."|`|tbb2W1eNaa	talk about using Yahoo Answers, and discuss any responses you get.

After every stage in this expansion Israel has appealed to "reason" and has suggested "negotiations". This is the traditional role of the imperial power, because it wishes to consolidate with the least difficulty what it has already taken by violence. The aggression committed by Israel must be condemned because every expansion is an experiment to discover how much more aggression the world will tolerate.    The tragedy of the people of Palestine is that their country was "given" by a foreign Power to another people for the creation of a new State. How much longer is the world willing to endure this spectacle of wanton cruelty? It is abundantly clear that the refugees have every right to the homeland from which they were driven, and the denial of this right is at the heart of the continuing conflict. No people anywhere in the world would accept being expelled en masse from their own country; how can anyone require the people of Palestine to accept a punishment which nobody else would tolerate?    We are frequently told, "We must sympathize with Israel because of the suffering of the Jews in Europe at the hands of the Nazis." What Israel is doing today cannot be condoned, and to invoke the horrors of the past to justify those of the present is gross hypocrisy."     For the entire statement go to http://www.corax.com/bookshelf/page.html Click Russell's "Various Writings" Then click "On Israel and Bombing"    Albert Einstein and other prominent Jews wrote a letter to the New York Times, December 4, 1948, denouncing Menachem Begin, a future prime minister of Israel as a FASCIST, who is highly regarded by many contemporary Israelis, including those in the Government. They wrote:     "Among the most disturbing political phenomena of our times is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the "Freedom Party" (Tnuat Haherut), a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal, to the NAZI and FASCIST parties. It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a TERRORIST, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.     The current visit of Menachem Begin, leader of this ("Freedom") party, to the United States is obviously calculated to cement political ties with conservative Zionist elements in the United States.     Today they speak of freedom, democracy and anti-imperialism, whereas until recently they openly preached the doctrine of the FASCIST STATE. It is in its actions that the TERRORIST PARTY portrays its real character; from its past actions we can judge what it may be expected to do in the future.     A shocking example was their behavior in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. This village, off the main roads and surrounded by Jewish lands, had taken no part in the war, and had even fought off Arab bands who wanted to use the village as their base. On April 9 (The New York Times), TERRORIST BANDS attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants - 240 men, women, and children - and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem."     To read the whole letter please go to newdemocracyworld.org/Einstein.htm     Albert Einstein said in 1920: "It has been clearly proclaimed that we are not seeking to create a political society, but our aim is a cultural one in the widest sense of the word." Book: Ideas and Opinions, Section title: Addresses on Reconstruction in Palestine.     Einstein was a Zionist ONLY WHEN Zionism was not political. In January, 1946, in a reply to the question of whether refugee settlement in Palestine demanded a Jewish state, Einstein told the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry: "The State idea is not according to my heart. I cannot understand why it is needed. It is connected with narrow-minded and economic obstacles. I believe it is bad. I have always been against it."     The Zionists have fabricated Pro-Israeli statements and attributed them to Einstein and Russell, saying that towards the end of their lives their views changed and they started thinking that a Jewish State was needed. If they didn't think that a Jewish State is needed in 1948 when the condition of Jews was pathetic, and in 1970, then why will their views change after 1970 by when Israel had given even more glaring evidence of its fascism? Be highly cautious because the Zionists are doing their best to distort facts and rewrite history.    The head of the political bureau of Hamas: Khalid Mishal said in 2006: "Hamas is extending a hand of peace to those who are truly interested in a peace based on justice." - U.K. newspaper "The Guardian"
VHNyiARCaa	I advise them both to forget the past and focus on their common enemy Israel|`|cNVTtkgmaa	Hamas|`|7geUgdqaaa	Fatah, unlike Hamas, is not democratically elected. It gained power by a coup with Israel's help. Fatah is Israel's puppet, like many other Arab governments. Fatah destroyed all offices of Hamas in the West Bank. But let me add that a few members of Fatah are corrupt, not all.    What Palestinians, who are represented by Hamas, really want is the ONE STATE SOLUTION (like what happened in South Africa), where Gaza, West Bank, and Israel become one state in which Arabs are equal citizens with voting rights. Here's Hamas's official Statement of Purpose: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jan... Israel is not allowing that because it wants to keep treating Arabs as sub-humans.

Abbas offered early elections, Hamas decided they would be better off if they claim that Fatah was abducting and killing Hamas members (funny claim, given that that was the tactics Hamas had started to apply first). As a result - over 600 dead Palestinians.|`|mrI8mfFpaa	YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW THAT???  JUST SEE: http://hamas-tactics.blogspot.com/  THEN YOU WILL KNOW!!!
