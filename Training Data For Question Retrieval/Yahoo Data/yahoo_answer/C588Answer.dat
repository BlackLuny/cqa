I think when I was 13 I was around 100 lbs.  I'd say anywhere from 90-115 would be healthy.  Under 90 sounds too skinny for your height, and over 120 maybe a little heavy at only 13.|`|2w1pmTpMaa	I was 5'2'' at age 13, and I weighed 85 pounds and considered to be thin. Add ten pounds because you're two inches taller, and another ten if you want to be more "average" size. Around 105 pounds would be perfect!
urNeu95Saa	Well MOST people only need about 2000 calories on a BALANCED diet.  Everyone is different with regard to the 500 calorie thing.  A pound of weight is about 3500 calories.  It is a complicated answer and you should research health and fitness.  Your body will not respond like another persons body to changes in caloric input.  Depends on your BMR, age, activity, life style, what kind of calories you are eating etc....  Hope this gets you going in the right direction though.      peace|`|ZVs1VOj1aa	|---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|ISF6mQ24aa	|---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|oCTMqI4haa	Depending on Age/Sex, you should take in about 2,000 calories. Don't count your calories though! Counting calories will not reduce your weight.  If you think you are overweight, simply excercise more & eat more fruit/vegetable.  Avoid wheat and sweets.    *And eat lots of pink grapefruit and drink lots of water!    it works wonders :)|`|dBensSCmaa	uhm, i guess it depends on your weight and how much you excesice.  i think 950 calories a day would be good. my mom went on that diet. she was stressed, but it worked
07YBD5mJaa	it's normal! your body is adjusting to this new change, and so many things affect your menses, stress, your diet, exercise. so don't worry, you have it for another 30-40 years, it will eventually set a schedule. best wishes!|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	er yeah. When i first got mine i got mine twice in one month and then like six months later i got it again|`|J5zqZp7Qaa	You are ok, don't worry.|`|fE3EDHa4aa	your completely fine...it happens all the time|`|Ujb6P4gMaa	You should talk to your mom.|`|a7b81aec51d8df49e523d067b9b07ea9aa	dont worry everything is fine. yes sometimes it is that irregular when you first get it.|`|diAqosiIaa	when you first start of that may happen so dont be scared it is your bodys way of adjusting to your changes not that you are a young lady|`|D6KMUndOaa	its your first few so its going to be off    after a year or two it will start on a normal lenghth like 4-6 weeks    but yea when you starrt its not going to be the regular lenghth its going tobe off for a few years or one .|`|gFP7REMGaa	i really dnt no  it's not suppose to be like that|`|Hsyjt3wTaa	everyone is different and it will probably regulate soon. if it does not then tell your mum and go see a doctor.|`|e99378bb47985373c887f665a870608daa	Why are you not asking your mom about this? You should, and then she can take you to the doctor.

This definitely sounds like endometriosis.  When you first start having periods, they are irregular - but they are months apart, not weeks apart.    Please have your mom take you to an OB/GYN and have a thorough exam.  This does not sound like what is the usual.  Your doctor can determine by tests whether it's just imbalanced hormones or an underlying condition.|`|UfWYWoOkaa	whoa thats weird talk to your mom  ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|P7t63rZnaa	Yeah, when you first get, you have it for a few days, then it takes about a year to go regular.

If Im right, give me 10 Points!|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	Dont worryy!  I've had my period for 3 years and mines still slightly irregular sometimes.  If you miss a couple of months or it stays really irregular for over 4 months, go to a doctor.    Hope I helped :)|`|iyhp1BM7aa	Yea definitely.Your period can be irregular for a few years after getting your first one. Two times in  one month is not usual though, you should ask your mom about seeing a doctor,just to make sure.=]]|`|AA10348091	its normal at first for it to be all over the place well if one of your friends is having it you tend to go with your closest friends hormones which could mean that at first you were on track but you spent to much time with a certain friend dont be scared its normal|`|wUdisPJZaa	You have some kind of infection, one that poses great threat to your life. Guys Rule. We only bleed if we feel like it.|`|uykhCiUWaa	Yes, it's perfectly normal to have your period like that. I did too, when I first started. Give it a few months, and if it doesn't start leveling out, I'd suggest visiting a doctor.  If you're that worried, speak to your mother, or an adult female that you trust to help you.|`|DXr8iqekaa	Yes, it can take 6 months to a year for your period to become regular, and it will never be perfectly regular unless you start taking birth control.|`|bBsbuMPZaa	Mine was like that too when i first got it. it only came twice a year...it was awesome!   My doctor said that it was because i was really skinny and very active.  Most pro sport people dont even get their periods cause they are so active.  but if it really bothers you, you can go on the pill and that makes it come regularly|`|ARJ5HL9caa	is this your 3rd period? if it is that might be a problem if it isnt hst count how many days it was from your last it should be between 20 to 35 days afer your last period|`|KCKcoEyqaa	lol no problem, thats exactly what happened to me, and it got even weirder, but now its ok, it'll be fine, dont need to worry. your ok hun|`|7mB2Hkj0aa	ya dont worry, when i had my first one it didnt happen again for another six months. but they even out quickly|`|LBwkckvkaa	you're totally normal.|`|c502c429ff24a2e80091482d2f80bb78aa	yes it is normal...    the first few really do come at random times    mine only became regular since i went on the contraceptive pill    i never had an exact amount of days between them so dont worry!!!|`|6VSf5uAeaa	i think some girls get it faster between months, it just depends on your lifestyle (eating habits, family history, etc.)
JwecpnBVaa	Eating pancakes for breakfast is fine!  Especially is they are whole grain but if not that is okay too!  Eating one meal that is higher in calories won't cause you to gain weight, last night I had a snickers and a twix and I didn't gain anything.  It takes time to put on weight and also time to take it off, all you need to do is exercise a little more than usual to undo the extra calories from the pancakes!|`|wDtA9hrhaa	no depends how you make them. If you use whole wheat flour, and berries instead of syrup it can be really healthy every morning. Or if by the end of the day you burned your calories, then i don't see why not!|`|al0cCPb6aa	eating pancakes once a week is okay...but everyday would be bad. Pancakes should be a treat...they aren't the greatest thing for you.|`|EpfajslTaa	ya its fine..just dont have alot of syrup|`|usCLweGAaa	Sure, you can have pancakes. It's fine as long as you aren't eating them everyday for breakfast. :) Go for it!

Xu4zdMhbaa	If you do not have an eating disorder then you should not worry about it.  Do not concentrate on eating more than you need.  Talk to a nutritionist and work out a diet plan and stick to it to the best of your ability.  Some people are just naturally skinny.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
B3hnfIsmaa	I went on the pill at 16 and i didnt need my parents with me. It helps when you first ask the doctor about it if you dont know your familys history of medical stuff like whether anyone closely related to you has had cancer, strokes, heart attacks etc as the pill can improve the chances slightly of these so it does help at first. After that you can renew your prescription yourself i think you have to be 16 in the UK though.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	You have to get it of your doctor or in your local family planning center.

4kGffvKuaa	your weight is totally normal, if anything it's a little underweight. But your calorie intake is way too low!

D4WkJ0b4aa	I lost my virginity when I was 17 to a boy I had been dating for 7 months who was also a virgin. It is now almost 5 years later and we are living together, recently engaged, and very happy!        I don't think it matters how old you are...obviously the longer you wait, the older and more mature you will be, so it will help you make the decision as to who is the right person. Personally, I "waited" until I was 17 because all of my friends had lost their virginity by 15 to guys who had used them for sex and then ditched them, and my friends all regretted it. I made a personal choice to wait until I was in love until I had sex, whether that meant I was 16 or 60, dating that person or waiting until our wedding night.       Sex is not pervy...it is natural to think about it, and enjoyable with the right partner(s). Hope this helped!   :)|`|A2g3mUF5aa	17|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	I was 19 and it was my wedding night.

rev4lrn0aa	Yep, I asked my doctor about this because I was feeling cramping about 2 weeks before my period and she said that it was me feeling myself ovulate. I never really felt it when I wasn't on this particular pill and she said that some pills will make the feeling more intense.|`|kzkrll3Xaa	yes,|`|LUBn5jtzaa	I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. If you're talking about a mild cramping or a mild pain that sometimes occurs when a woman ovulates, the answer is yes and no, depending on the type of pill.    There are 2 types of birth control pills. The progestin-only pills sometimes prevent ovulation and sometimes do not (it relies on other things to prevent pregnancy), so if a woman does ovulate, then she still will be able to feel it. Progestin and estrogen pills do prevent ovulation, so a woman won't feel an ovulation because it doesn't happen.|`|taSVMvj9aa	Contraceptive pills stop ovulation that's how you don't get pregnant.  So if you don't ovulate...then no you should feel it.
OLXv3DEAaa	That is a dilation and curettage. Basically the dilation means they use something to open up dilate your cervix and the curette is an instrument they use to clear out the tissue from the uterus. Sometimes they will put you to sleep with general anesthesia but a lot of the time they use a different kind of anesthesia and you are awake. She should ask her doctor about it?    They do this procedure for early abortions, if you have a miscarriage and not everything comes out naturally, sometimes after having a baby and also for certain medical conditions that involve the uterus like if you have bleeding problems or something?    edit= they do it either at the hospital or the doctors office. That varies a lot- some docs don't do it at their office, sometimes you need to have it done at hospital because of your specific medical issues/health, etc.    Here is an explanation of how it is done, it is written for patients and tells you all about it  http://www.stjohnsmercy.org/healthinfo/t...|`|d6wBfCvzaa	they dont put you to sleep    they just clean you out. they do that also when you miscarry in early pregnancy.

It is possible that it could have because some people's break very easily (tampons, sports, horse riding can all break it). However some people's will never actually break as such and will just break down when their body decides it no longer wants it.    Generally, there would be blood if it had broken. If there wasn't blood then it is probably still intact or it was broken already.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	It is possible but your hymen can break by other means than penetration. ie if you ride horses play sports do gymnastics use tampons so it is no big deal and no-one can tell how a hymen has been broken|`|4uB0bbhnaa	unlikely..|`|xtH1eDITaa	I don't know, but you can look. For real! Just get a mirror and take a look donw there.|`|xZMoaqRSaa	hmm hard to say mine never broke from sex i assumming it broke from tampons or something|`|6eVJpomYaa	If there has been any sort of insertion of any object, than your hymen has most likely been broken.  However, if you really want to know for sure, go to the free clinic, that way your parents don't find out if that is a concern of yours.    Hope this helps!|`|jaUBFRn1aa	Yes hun|`|suBNmjONaa	did it hurt? did you bleed? if not, then no you did not bust your cherry. better luck next time.|`|Y8UICH0Daa	sweetie, if your hymen was in place the penis wouldnt have been able to be inside you, so yes, yer cherry is forever gone. the hymen is a small flap of skin that seals the vagina, if you wear tampons, that will break the hymen.

RczxgiQaaa	Wow.. that's one of the worst articles I've ever seen regarding creatine and it's affects.      Creatine is probably the most studied supplement in history.  There have been ZERO long term affects documented to date.  Gastric upset *can* be associated with a loading phase, but within the 30 day period that it takes for creatine to be effective, it's been shown that a loading phase is not necessary.  Can't say I've ever experienced or heard of mood swings.  This isn't a steroid.. it's a compound found naturally within the body and many meat products.    That being said, creatine does not build muscle.. only protein can do that.  Creatine will give you *some* energy boost to make workouts more intense, it will help deliver protein to the muscle, and it will increase fluid within the muscle cell.      If you're under 18, forget the creatine & just stick with protein powders post workout & first thing in the morning.|`|zOjkgNvVaa	Pros:    - Helps deliver more testosterone to body cells, which can lead to bigger muscle mass  - Draws liquid to the muscles, which can give a 3-10% increase in muscle mass  - Can help you workout longer    Cons:    - Diarrhea  - Mood swings  - Kidney damage    My suggestion would be to continue with your regularly scheduled program. Gradually add more weight to your sessions and you should safely add the muscle that you seek.
Bso2vRYjaa	Here is this website.    It looks pretty straightforward. Hope it helps.     http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/e/ebola/ba...|`|mYGbxuCAaa	try webmd.com|`|WFohcXQPaa	http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/Spb/mnpag...    The CDC (Centers for Disease Control) would be your best bet.
d3VV4b6vaa	lime is great for your skin.  you can actually cut a slice from the lime and genlty rub it all over your face AFTER cleansing (clearasils not good, but if its working for you; ok) it acts as a toner/astringent. you should only do this at night or if you don't plan on being out in the sun. citrus and sun do not mix (burn easily and can lead to permanent marks on your face) if you already have the lime juice, buy cotton pads (or the circular puff balls) and just use circular motions and you massage it into your skin. and don't worry, your skin will absorb it, not the tissue.
KM5MNRJmaa	first of all don't skip meals. just eat smaller meals, more often. eating fires up your metabolism, so if you don't eat regularly you will be sluggish and it will seem impossible to lose weight. just try to keep it healthy. keep the focus on fruits/veggies and fill in your diet with other stuff. drink lots of water to help flush out toxins, which can be making you hold on to the extra weight.     pb&j is ok, but not great. you still need your nutrients and all you're getting from that is protein really. try tomato and cheese; ham, cheese and lettuce; or cucumber. when having a sandwich make sure you use whole wheat bread too, keeps you full longer and is healthier. the yogurt is good, but snack on veggies too. they have almost no calories so eat as much of them as you want.    try walking more often, for the exercise and the general feeling of well-being you get from it. the exercises you are doing is good for toning and building muscle but not necessarily for losing weight. try something cardio, that gets your heart pumping. walking, jogging, biking, dancing...all these will work.|`|al0cCPb6aa	You need to do more cardio...do your parents have any work out vidows? Sit ups and crunches are strenght excersises, so they help with muscles not burnign fat...so you have to do work outs that burn fat.|`|rCdi8NJ6aa	maybe right now you are just replacing the fat with muscle and you can't see the weight loss now. I just say kept it up !|`|DvNfQMQuaa	PLEASE, DON'T SKIP ANY MEAL! This could cause death! now hon, you are not fat, you don't over exercise yourself, not a good idea if your amount is like 10 sit ups go for 15, then for 20 then for 25, get my drift?|`|nLScNIekaa	first of all breakfast is the most important meal because it keeps your metabolism goin, if you dont eat breakfast it will slow down a lot.  Also eat a lot of protein and not a lot of carbs. eat small meals throughout the day instead of 3 large meals eat 6 meals in smaller portions.|`|RJL9I2xpaa	Eat dinner and breakfast. If you don't eat your body packs more weight. For breakfast eat eggs or something and for dinner you only need a salad if you want. Don't skip meals to lose weight.
4HQxLXQCaa	Enjoy wasting your money on Acai smoothies.    Any weight lost will be the result of exercise and dieting, not the result of Acai.    Acai is just a regular berry like blueberries or rasberries.  Unfortunately, some corporation though a great way to make money would be to stretch the truth and turn Acai into some sort of miracle product.  Now everybody has been brainwashed into thinking Acai is this amazing product, when it's just a freaking berry.    To lose fat:  1. DONT BELIEVE THOSE FAD DIETS!  DIET PILLS ARE GIMMICKS! Yes, Acai berries/pills/juice is a fad diet.  2. DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF!  Unless you are 4ft tall, a 1,200 calorie a day diet is DANGEROUS and won't work in the long run.  3. Calculate your BMR.  Do a google search.  A good calculator would ask for your age, height, weight, and activity level.  4. Eat healthy and eat about 500 calories a day less than your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).  Your BMR is how many calories you need per day to maintain your current weight.  5. Eat 5-6 small meals a day.  This keeps your metabolism up.  Each meal should include fruits, veggies, water, and protein.  5. Drink at least 64oz (8 8oz glasses) of water a day.  No soda (that includes diet soda).  6. Do light/moderate cardio 3 to 5 times a week for 30 to 45 minutes each time.  Running and aerobics class are great.  7. Do some strength training to make sure you lose fat and not muscle.  Don't worry; you won't look like the hulk if you lift weights.  8. You should lose about 1-2lbs (.45-.9kg) per week.  If you lose more than that, chances are the rest is stool, water weight, or even muscle mass.  9. Weigh yourself only once a week at the same time (ie every Friday morning).  Your weight fluctuates a lot during any 24hour period because of water and food intake and also bowel movements.  Be patient and be smart.  If you follow this guideline you will be very happy with your results.|`|w6SVI1H6aa	An acai smoothie is just based from the acai berry which is a fruit that will help speed up your digestive track.  If you just have the smoothies for 3 days your body will be out of balance.  This is not an effective way to loose weight and any weight you do loose will be gained back quickly after you resume your normal eating habits.  You need to have a healthy life style with a balanced diet and working out.  Using an acai berry can and will help but you cant hope for miracles.
al0cCPb6aa	I would suggest drinking lots of water and drinking tea...this will help you feel full...also if you want chocolate i suggest buying calcium supplements to help wtih the cravings. Go through your house and throw out any food that you KNOW you shouldn't eat.
ARJ5HL9caa	try looking at porn or something while you masturbate also if you notice when you getting into it your but tighten it might sound odd but while you masturbate use something to keep ur butt from tightening like the handle of a hair brush and then finger yourself and keep going don't stop til you cant go no more|`|44bILHJkaa	can I help you?|`|QXt1zUiFaa	try not touching that for a while because that could cause a lot of health problems|`|RSWbsE0gaa	go to your doctors but every seems ok but just to be sure x|`|7WRvdaj5aa	Ok. You will have to go to the gyn, if you do not leave your body alone for at least a week. FYI- That only feels good if a guy is shoving his sensory spot there. Be careful my friend
UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...

gERaZGZeaa	"The only thing milk is good for is calcium"  NOT TRUE    There is lots of protein in milk, which helps supplement your diet if you aren't eating lots of meat or drinking protein shakes.|`|VfcZvAbgaa	milk helps you in many ways.  Yes it strengthens your bones and makes you more easily gain muscle.  Vitamin D milk isn't always good though, try drinking 2% milk, it is the best and occasionally drink whole milk.|`|al0cCPb6aa	Just take calcium chewables instead...I  don't drink milk...you don't have too. Have you tried Vanilla soy milk? That stuff is pretty good.  The only thing milk is good for is calcium...and you can get that in so many forms besies milk. :) Hope this helps.|`|DvNfQMQuaa	Um well I know you are trying hard, but yes!

wXx0tMxnaa	its normal if your a teenager..i go thru the same weight fluxuating thing too..|`|tOMe6s3Caa	Ah, well this may sound strange, but feel free to Google it. The pull of the sun contributes about 5 pounds to your weight because of the stronger force of gravity during the day than nearing the night when the sun is increasing in distance from the Earths rotation and the moon has a lesser effect dealing with the gravity pushing down on you.|`|5cbbb1f6657fe92c7946ac17e5ffecbcaa	This sounds illogical. But i might have to do with the way you stand on weighing scale. So when center of body mass is not properly adjusted then you might have different readings. Try leaning forward and see if it gives different reading.    AJ|`|iF0EVxfWaa	well....because your weight jumps at random times...such as before breakfast...maybe its because you eat dinner really late...try eating dinner before 8 that way your body has enough of energy from you to digest the food... Also, when you leave after breakfast you just ate so it don't weigh yourself rite away    Is that good enough?|`|7igxiGrAaa	Check to make sure your scale is on a flat surface with no slant or anything. The scale balances off the floor, so if you move it to a different area it will effect the balance and therefore give you different readings.     Also, do you weight yourself before going to the bathroom in the morning? If you go to the bathroom after having weighed yourself, there will be weight loss.    Another thing could just be that your scale is going. Try a different one?|`|mJFgCvYlaa	You need to weigh yourself at the same time during the day, and with the same kind of clothes. Typically, even without shoes, my indoor clothes weigh as much as 1-2 lbs (shirt, jeans, socks, no jacket) depending on the accuracy of the scale.  Like others have said. You are your lightest right after you get up, preferably you want to weigh yourself right after you went to the bathroom in the morning before you brush your teeth.|`|9alN3sCTaa	water retention. they say shoes fit tighter in the night also|`|DNxZuoOGaa	You have to weigh yourself at the same time everyday. Eating, Drinking, or even clothes can add alot of weight. Weigh yourself every morning and it will be constant.|`|z7ZjhN00aa	water retention. they say shoes fit tighter in the night also|`|4HQxLXQCaa	Water and food intake, pee stool and sweat loss.    Stop weighing yourself every 5 minutes.  The most you should be weighing yourself if once a week.

AA11955868	Swelling varies a whole lot on when it might go down. I could guess from 1-2 weeks. If something hurts I wouldn't really play around with moving it too much as you might screw up your stitches and go through it all again.     Do you have an appointment for when the stitches need to come out, if they do at all. If nothing has changed in a week I might speak with your dr about possible infection to ease your mind. It might just take longer for you to heal up.     It's a little hard to gage what amount of warmth and redness suggests infection since it sounds like you had a pretty severe injury. Icing is suggested as is trying to keep it clean.|`|9xnSnRmraa	lol,|`|IR21UpMeaa	I would go back to your GP it could be infected.  Get them to swab you for MRSA|`|OD3hxWxvaa	put ice on it|`|0PgdLh9Uaa	it might take a while... cuz u cut it pretty badly..  or it might be infected....      nothing permanent.    feel better :]|`|AA11298074	if it's red and feels warm to the touch it could be infected|`|KOH5kPuLaa	if it dosnt go down soon it may be infected|`|dgJcxkCGaa	Bending and using your finger is going to make it swell. Using ice to control the swelling would be a good idea.  Twenty minutes at a time several times a day. Please just don't put the ice directly on your skin cover your skin with a thin towel or put the ice in a sock. If its warm and swollen than I would be having it looked at. When I mean warm as mean in warm then normal. Does the rest the the injury look normal? If not get it looked at.
dP6LZsoZaa	Never make yourself puke!! That's so dangerous. I understand the fact that you feel like you've ruined your diet because you've eaten burritos and oreos but actually that's not true. You shouldn't be feeling guilty. Frozen burritos is not a bad choice. And for God's sake 2 oreos are nothing! My advice for you is to eat a fruit and a sandvich at 8:00 so that you don't starve yourself.|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	Just because you eat less doesn't mean you eat any healthier. you completely missed breakfast which is key to a healthy diet. Loose the oreos|`|wDtA9hrhaa	i dont think you did bad. Burritos are good for you, they have protein.  The bar Is healthy also. You only ate under 1,000 calories. You didnt eat alot at all. I think you should eat dinner.

PeCm21meaa	as long as you plan to eat dinner as well, i'd say yeah, that's pretty healthy. however, your timing is kind of weird, but thats probably just a schedule thing.  as i say, as long as that isn't ALL you eat in a day, you're doing great :)|`|al0cCPb6aa	the pizza is okay as long as it's just a very rare thing....like once a week or even less then that...something like that can really throw you off. Pizza is very fattening probably more fattening then everything else you at that day. 5 pounds isn't much though, at this rate you should be fine.|`|q6Mknp3zaa	Yes I think that is a very good start to loosing weight. maybe replace the pizza with something else and try to use low fat dressings for the salad
iLrp65oXaa	I don't think they are worth it.  They aren't filling and just leave you hungry and more likely to binge on something unhealthy.|`|wDtA9hrhaa	no, I like to enjoy my meals when i get them, not drink it down with some sugar and added protein.

9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? A heating pad on your lower stomach should help some with the cramps. But your going to HAVE to tell your mom, rather or not you get along or not. She will need to buy you some pads.|`|u7o75zipaa	Okay, try and stay calm because it's totally normal to be freaked.    For the stomach ache, get ibuprofen. It's the best thing for cramps because it's an anti-inflammatory.  Okay, you definately need pads or tampons - I'd suggest pads to begin with. Can you go to a store and get them? Or else phone your mum so she can bring some home? Don't worry about telling her, she'll understand. In the meantime contact an aunt, granny, friend, cousin etc. You need something to absorb the blood.    Don't worry. It's always horrible your first period. It'll get better.x|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	Congratulations on becoming a woman!  You need to tell your mom, she has gone through the same thing and will understand. It is all a part of growing up. She will probably be thrilled for you and very proud of you! Until she gets home, change your underwear and get a fresh pair and put the old pair in the sink in some cold water. Roll up some toilet paper or kleenex and use that instead of a pad. If you have a heating pad, use that, it will help you with your cramps. Take 1 or 2 Advils (ibuprofen) depending on how bad your cramps are. Just relax, watch TV, read a book until your mom gets home.  When she does get home, say, "Mom, I started my period today". Or, if you don't want to tell her straight away, write her a note and put it somewhere where she will see it. She will understand, don't worry!  Visit this site for more help on how to tell your mom, or for more information about your period. http://www.beinggirl.ca/en_CA/pages/tipd...    Good luck, and congrats! :]|`|ijpU8jSCaa	so what are you doingg to protect yourselff from going throughh ? ..|`|tfqjt9lWaa	Well, first things first.       Supplies (since no pads or tampons)- get 2 pairs of underwear and alot of toliet paper.     then put one underwear on w/ alot of toliet paper then put another underwear on for extra protection.    For cramps take ( advil,tyenol, pamprin.. ect.)      Then Call (grandma, aunt. or even a friend and ask them for some pads/tampons til your mom gets home..)      when your mom gets home tell her that you started your period and ask her to buy you some pads/tampons and if something goes wrong then just get some money and go to your local drugstore and buy some.      hope this helped!|`|HQKuzxulaa	Please stop taking tablets and lie on the bed instead. Use a small towel. Don't get all worked up, what is happening to you is normal.Whether you get on well with your mum or not is irrelevant; she is the only person you can talk to about your period, she'll know exactly what to do. Try and relax. Take deep breaths and stay put on that bed until your mum comes back. You've just become a woman !|`|2IGcH3xnaa	ahaha. That sucks. Welcome to the world! If your lucky it'll happen every month on time, so you'll be prepared next time.  Make sure to tell your mom. You'll regret it if you dont.

h8l1H4N4aa	I just got treated for the same problem.  It went on for months and drove me crazy.  It turned out to be a problem with my eustachian tube in my left ear.  Nothing big, but the dr. said it's pretty common.  I was given nasal spray and some allergy pills and it was cleared up in a few days.  I should have gone to the doctor a lot sooner and saved myself the aggravation but I thought it was just wax and tried to ignore it.  You could just see a regular doctor or an ear,nose and throat doctor and get treated.    I tried the ear drops and ear cleaners too.  Just made things more annoying.

B52KNW7Haa	Belly fat is in the abs region.  I have the Wii fit. Laugh all you want I have lost 13 pounds and my stomach doesn't make me look pregnant anymore. I do 45 minutes a day of going back and forth between yoga and strength and will lose 2-5 pounds after the workout.  I weigh myself and then work out and then weigh myself after the workout.      I will then do 15 minutes of the aerobics which includes running (jogging in place) hula hoop, boxing,  and step aerobics.   After that workout I will lose .04 pounds.      Crunches and jackknifes daily will tone your abs as well as some of the yoga poses.  Running will increase your heart rate and burn calories but will not tone your stomach like specific exercise to that area will.      edit*  Oh and I completely cut out all fast food, snacking between meals, and eating after 9:00pm.  If you cannot be disciplined to watch what you eat you will make the journey to a 6 pack longer and more difficult to obtain.|`|5zLTWDOSaa	I lost a lot of fat playing basketball .... and gained a lot back from being lazy!!!|`|7S0ore8Caa	It will definitely help.

zhk8o514aa	No.  A mole needs to be removed by an dermatologist or your doctor.       If you have insurance tell your doctor you want this mole to be tested for Melanoma.  The only way to test that mole for it is to remove it.|`|3e35a0513fedfde324327c2ce1f90a3baa	put vineger on it and that should make it smaller|`|o9F9iJ8eaa	whack a mole|`|pYpXj7gOaa	you can ask you're physican or dermotoligist to remove it,  other than that i dont think there is any "at home" remedy that would rid you of it.|`|4IYKRhxIaa	have you heard of table saws.....?|`|224cm8qtaa	If you are talking about skin moles:  One such remedy you can try is to extract the juice of sour apples and apply this mixture on the mole three times a day for around three weeks. Once you start don't stop. If you continue regularly, you will find that the mole will have turned much, much dimmer by the end of the third week.    Another highly effective home remedy is applying the juice of an onion once a day for several weeks on the mole. This can also help to eliminate moles.    Take a pinch of baking soda with a little bit of castor oil and dab this paste on to the area where the mole is present and leave it overnight. Do this continuously for several days..    You can make use of drumstick pods by grinding these finely to a smooth paste like mixture and then add fresh lemon  extract to it. When this is done, you can add this paste to the area of the mole on a regular basis. Slowly, the mole will fade off.    Another home remedy that is recommended is using dandelion roots. First of all, you have to cut the root of a dandelion plant. Then rub this root on to the mole till it's milky like juice seeps out and covers the mole completely. If you do this at least once every day for several weeks, you may find that it will eliminate it.

WW3vz3HMaa	there are 3 classes of drugs used to treat the problems you refer to  the number of different drugs is great. the number of combinations of drugs is huge. if you meds are not working then talk to the doctor .    after about 11 years of depression i found my own combination of meds i wanted asked my doc to give me them he did and i am way better. now that is rare for a patient to find there own meds but i suppose i was just lucky . anyway the point is over the years i was given many different meds and only this last combination worked for me   that is welbutrin and effexor  that helped me but each person is different . another thing is to find the doctor you trust .i would most likely be dead if i had stuck with this one doctor i ran into years ago but i didn't and i am here  . i hope you get better soon . pray often|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Yes, but it's hard to know what's right for u. I'm taking wellbutrin and cymbalta, after several years of trying other med. It's trial and error. I know this s--s but in this day and age we're still waiting it out.

A few are Zoloft, Paxil, Seroquel and Wellbutrin. They all have their own set of side effects and unfortunately, they appear to mirror a couple of your "symptoms". However, most "basic" symptoms usually only last the first week or two after taking the first dose;until your system gets used to it. At least that's how it works for me. Ask your doctor and look up on Web MD for info.
BPTfHiw5aa	Generally you need a 2 year Associates degree in order to work as a hygienist. You could get a 4 year Bachelor's degree if you want to work outside of the office in many other capacities. I do like my job. It's an ideal job if you can afford to work part-time. Working full-time becomes physically difficult after a while and burn out becomes a factor.

They work in community health clinics, hospitals and for individual dentists or group practices. You can train as a therapist or hygienist with two A levels or equivalent, and/or a dental nursing qualification.    To be a dental therapist/hygienist you need to be:    caring, with a reassuring manner     good with both children and adults  this means having excellent communication skills and the ability to explain things clearly    understanding of patients' anxieties     good with your hands, as the work can be fiddly     interested in science subjects, especially biology.      Dental therapists and dental hygienists must be fully qualified and registered with the General Dental Council (GDC).    Dental hygienists  Dental hygienists carry out treatments prescribed by dentists, and teach oral hygiene. They:    clean, scale and polish patients' teeth; sometimes, extremely unhealthy/dirty mouths have to be cleaned up, if the patient's teeth have been neglected for a long time     check for signs of gum disease     teach patients how to clean their own teeth properly in order to keep their teeth and gums healthy     apply fluorides and fissure sealants to teeth to reduce dental decay     talk to groups of children and adults - such as pregnant women - about the importance of diet and the correct care of teeth. Preventive dentistry is a very important part of the hygienist's work.      Hygienists do not carry out treatments such as fillings and extractions.    Dental hygienists can work with dentists in general dental practices, as well as in hospitals, the community dental services, the Armed Forces, and occasionally in clinics within very large industrial concerns. In hospital settings, hygienists may be working with people who have had surgery or complicated orthodontic treatment. Hygienists working in general practice may work for several dental practices, spending a set amount of time at each one.    Training  Training is either through a 27-month, full-time diploma course or a three-year degree course, provided by one of the dental teaching hospitals or at a university school of dentistry. Most courses lead to a combined hygienist/therapist qualification. Some degree courses are called oral health sciences.    Applicants for training need at least five GCSEs at grades A*-C, plus two A levels for the diploma, or three for the degree, in most cases. GCSE subjects should include English and a science (often biology); maths may also be required. Your A levels should include at least one science subject; more than one science may be preferred and biology is often specified. Entry requirements do vary, so check individual courses carefully.    For diploma courses, a recognised dental nursing qualification, such as the National Certificate in Dental Nursing, may be acceptable instead of A levels. The society, health and development Diploma will be available in some schools and colleges from September 2008 and may be an acceptable alternative. Applicants with alternative qualifications should check their acceptability with individual training schools.    Previous work experience in a dental environment is beneficial for all courses, as is gaining a dental nurse qualification.    Portsmouth University runs a six-month foundation course, aimed at dental nurses wishing to gain entry to their combined dental hygiene/dental therapy degree course, but who do not hold required A level entry qualifications.    A new foundation degree in oral health sciences is available at the University of Essex. This two-year, full-time course, which combines studying with work experience, is currently awaiting full approval by the GDC for registration purposes.    NHS bursaries may be available to students on NHS-funded places on approved courses; course admissions tutors can provide more information. This means the NHS pays your tuition fees and you may receive a maintenance allowance.    Both the British Society of Dental Hygiene and Therapy and the British Association of Dental Therapists provide lists of dental training centres on their websites (see details at end of leaflet).    It is also possible to train in dental hygiene through the Armed Forces.    Pay  Pay varies, but, as a rough guide, a qualified hygienist or therapist working within the NHS would earn around 19-25,000, moving onto a higher salary band with greater responsibilities. Private practice, or high-level jobs in hospitals, may pay more.|`|3bufKSvBaa	asfbajfjds|`|QaFpVkIXaa	my mom is in collage and she is going to school for only 2 years
avc7ixnxaa	It all depends on your body weight and the intensity of the cardio you are doing. If you weigh more, you will burn more calories, as your body has to work harder to carry the weight through the motions. I suggest using an online calorie calculator to figure out how much you are burning.

Smoking is a leading cause of cancer and of death from cancer. It causes cancers of the lung, esophagus, larynx (voice box), mouth, throat, kidney, bladder, pancreas, stomach, and cervix, as well as acute myeloid leukemia (1).     Smoking also causes heart disease, stroke, lung disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema), hip fractures, and cataracts. Smokers are at higher risk of developing pneumonia and other airway infections (1).     A pregnant smoker is at higher risk of having her baby born too early and with an abnormally low weight. A woman who smokes during or after pregnancy increases her infants risk of death from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) (1).     Millions of Americans have health problems caused by smoking. Cigarette smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke cause an estimated average of 438,000 premature deaths each year in the United States. Of these premature deaths, about 40 percent are from cancer, 35 percent are from heart disease and stroke, and 25 percent are from lung disease (2). Smoking is the leading cause of premature, preventable death in this country.    Regardless of their age, smokers can substantially reduce their risk of disease, including cancer, by quitting.    You may need help doing so, but its better if you DO stop|`|UnuRaYbjaa	Quit! It is not cool! It can kill you! If you want to live longer than stop! You can get lung cancer from it. Don't listen to anyone who says its cool because it is not, its digusting!|`|qje4beuBaa	Firstly, yes you should defiantly quit smoking. With all we know now about smoking and the health risks it brings, you would be stupid not to. As for the why, just look at the cover of the packs you buy and they tell you many reasons to quit. Even though quitting can be tough, you need it stop.|`|codA4Jomaa	Smoking is a habit that can get out of hand. If you go to any anti smoking website, you will find that cigarettes have so many carcinogens in them. Carcinogens are cancer causing substances. I think there are about 40+ carcinogens. The things that cigarettes can do to your health outweigh the "cool factor" that many people put on smoking and tobacco use.|`|nKyluejWaa	Wow...nafmeister has no idea what he is saying. Smoking isn't cool at all. It's a gross habit for both men and women. Nothing attractive of smoking.   You should quit. You are not only slowly killing yourself but those around you. [2nd hand smoke is also very bad] Plus, your wasting a lot of money on cigars. Even if it doesn't seem like it...it adds up and you end up spending hundreds of dollars in a year or more just on cigars. Plus, once you get all sick cause of smoking your ganna have to pay big bills for all the medication and things your ganna need.     For your health & the health around you..QUIT!|`|ac1824875bd5b0235707e90dd22614ecaa	I used to smoke and got emphysema/copd in my late 30's and am now on oxygen and waiting for a lung transplant. Copd is the fourth leading cause of death and is caused by smoking. 20% of those who smoke will get copd. It is not worth the risk. If you are single you will only have 25% of the people to choose from to date instead of all because only a smoker will go out with you. Your smell and breath will be highly offensive to the other 75% who don't smoke. So why would you want to smoke? How does it enhance your life. Like remember the time we smoked and we --------? No you don't remember because nothing good or fun happened, it just slowly robs you of your health and vitality. I did not get to the part of what it does to your heart yet.........|`|RdYKQkLDaa	Well that depends. How good is your relationship with, oh... I don't know...your lungs!?!
zjsP15dpaa	Yes because in most cases if not all you end up with cancer.  My grandmother was diagnosed in Oct and now we are taking care of her.  It was her choice to smoke since she was 18, not ours.  But I LOVE my grandmother so I will do anything for her to get her through this rough time.  She is on chemo and radiation and it is taking a toll on her body.  If you don't quit for yourself, think of your family...|`|Iar0ngMXaa	yes you should quit smoking. smoking increases your risk for heart disease and cancer. it can also affect your blood pressure. you can develop copd and emphesema, there is just a plethora of stuff it can cause and none of it is good.|`|wzdRJxzRaa	yes b/c u might die

AA11185479	Not true.  You are only 14 and have many more years to finish growing into your adult size.  Your breast size will change as you grow older, even if your weight doesn't change significantly.  Gaining weight isn't any assurance that the weight will be directed to your breasts, anyway.    I achieved my my adult height and weight at 14, but rapidly changed in a few years from an A cup to D cup and finally evened out to a C cup in my college years.  Don't worry, there is plenty of hope.|`|x3EPqezJaa	You probably have some growing to do yet, whether you gain weight or not. You are pretty skinny, though, so the first place your body takes fat from is the breasts, when you're that skinny.|`|rev4lrn0aa	You're still young so they will still probably grow for a couple more years. It does come to a certain point though where to make them bigger you will have to gain weight. 5'10" and 124 pounds is actually pretty skinny... you could gain 10 more pounds and still be a nice weight.|`|9kWMOb6Taa	You will grow my mom had that size till she was 18 then wow ds|`|8ytLLHV4aa	If you don't have the nuitrition to grow, you wont grow.    but the fact that you are 5'10" means you are healthy enough that you were able to grow beyond the average, and only at the age of 14.  give yourself time, your breasts might grow.    or who knows, you might not have the genes for it.  still, you shouldn't worry about it.
qgRo07M9aa	you have to be 16 in the UK to be able to get it without parents consent.|`|hnnMVO39aa	You can go to a pharmacy (it's behind the counter) and just ask them. I think it is called Plan B.

HB8uby7xaa	there are different risks associated with each. marijuana you are more likely to go to jail for using.|`|xgrNAwa1aa	Marijuana is so much safer than alcohol. It is so much safer than tobacco even.   You can't OD on it, as long as you don't smoke too much you can still function, and the best thing about it is had it been found today vs back in the 30's when prohibition for it started, it would be considered a miracle drug that could help many diseases both physical and mental.  The only thing unsafe about it is that the heat that comes from smoking it in a pipe or joint can cause cancer. There are some toxins in most pot on the street unless you get Hydro.  It is recommended that if you are going to do it, use a water bong or ventilator as the safest way with no side effects.  Hungry, happy, and sleepy are the only effects it causes anyway.  It also is not physically addictive like alcohol and tobacco.   It should be legalized and cigarettes and all tobacco products should be illegal.  And I smoke both...trying to quit the cigs though. I know that is what will most likely kill me. I stop marijuana all the time with no withdrawals but unfortunately tobacco has it's nicotine hold on me.  Go rent the movie; Super High Me.   It proves how little danger there is with marijuana in a tested environment with a man who does not smoke tobacco. It is funny and very informative.|`|B3jacMDeaa	Physically, marijuana is safer.  It is virtually impossible to OD on pot.  You would have to smoke more than humanly possible to get enough into your system to have it poison you.  Alcohol poisoning kills many people each year.    Alcohol abuse also causes a physical dependence.  Withdrawal can cause deadly seizures.  Pot is not physically addictive, so while it may be difficult for a heavy user to stop because he or she is psychologically/emotionally addicted, the physical element is not the same.    Alcohol makes some people very angry or violent.  Pot, generally, does not have that effect.  Long term heavy use of alcohol can do damage to every part of your body: your liver, your circulatory system, your digestive system and your nervous system.  Long term heavy use of pot can do damage to your lungs and impair your memory.    Both can be dangerous because they impair your ability to make sound decisions.  Driving while intoxicated, whether you're drunk or high, means that your response time is slower and you are less likely to pay attention to your surroundings.    Alcohol is legal, pot is not.  So when you possess or use marijuana you risk being arrested.  Personally, I find this to be ridiculous because alcohol kills people and has no medical use.  Marijuana, on the other hand, has been found to help people with painful terminal illnesses deal with nausea, wasting and pain.|`|4dIWZCLGaa	Being an alcoholic I believe marijuanna is definitely safer than alcohol and much better. Marijuanna isn't healthy and can be unsafe but in comparison it's safer. Alcohol makes it easier for you to do stupid things. Marijuanna is more of a mental thing.
BG8vMyZjaa	Composite bonding  Dental bonding is a technique that has been used in cosmetic dentistry for many years and can transform your smile in just a single visit. The process involves the skillful / artistic use of the correct amount and colour of "dental compsite" which is a moldable material with a paste like consitency made from acrylic resins and a variety of filler depending on the type used. Bonding is used for a variety of cosmetic dental procedures including:     Dental crowns are restorations that protect damaged, cracked or broken down teeth. A crown strengthens your existing damaged tooth so as to preserve its functionality. Dental crowns are also commonly known as caps because a crown sits over your existing tooth covering the entire outer surface analagous to how a baseball cap would cover your head. The animations below graphically illustrate the procedure of placing dental crowns:      The cost depends on the dentist carrying out the work and his/her level of experience and qualifications. There is a large variation in the fees charged between individual dentists e.g. a dental crown can cost as little as 300.00 in some clinics and upto 2000.00 per tooth in others. Specialists would generally tend to charge more than non specialists in a particular field of cosmetic dentistry.|`|PrqCDZ7raa	Go to the dentist (3)

u8CFwtyMaa	I've got a similar device, and it is good. There's a vibration attachment, but I don't use that too much.  The only downside is that it's a pain to clean afterwards, but it does feel very much like a vagina, and it's much better than using the hand alone.  I agree that some sort of 'hands free' method would be good.  Hope this helps, and if you get one, have fun with it.|`|aH0yYcTIaa	there probably is a device at specialty sex toy shops  I saw one the look like a glider chair but there's a hole in the seat and you put a dildo in it, and while you rock back and forth the chair f**ks you|`|tQGRJBYAaa	LOL, I've seen one and wanted it. Only thing is I'm 16 and if my parents found out, that would be awkward.|`|akHYRh5Raa	what you waiting for mate, invent it and sell it!!|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	Nah bro....your right hand is free!!!|`|PzAyT7Vwaa	That's way too much work just to get off. Go to a club and get yourself a hood rat... much easier.|`|nLScNIekaa	those things are for creepy people either just go get laid or use your hand.|`|NWie2UQsaa	I own one and it's pretty amazing. I say go for it. The best part is you can use either hand with desired results. I've had one for almost a year now and it's still feels good|`|d3JqTXIOaa	Very Nice!! Even tho your using your hand still it covers the whole penis while with a hand when you go all the way down, the top 3 inches are not being touched. If u want go to google and type in "how to make your own fleshlight.) But they are defeinetly worth the money!!!!|`|A0SsXJ4zaa	that would be awesome!      or you can make it like a mouth, so you are getting an under the counter ********|`|t8ohhWX9aa	damn...can't you get laid? I am 15 and I get laid like once a week|`|uFbytsw5aa	You are disgusting! Find a girlfriend, or just quit being so horny..

2zym4J9xaa	No!  (i'm only speaking from the smoking side)    I just quit smoking about a month ago so i am going to help you.  Go to WHYQUIT.COM  That will probably save your life, read everything you can.    Noone is safe from tabacco.  There are 17 and 19 year old boys that get diseases, lose limbs and even die.  Not uncommon for people in their 20's and 30's to get a tobacco related disease or even die from it.    Do yourself the biggest favor you've ever done yourself in your life and go to that website right now and read.    I tried to quit about 20 times and failed.  I finally succeeded but i had to arm myself with knowledge on how to do it sucessfully.  I found that knowledge at WHYQUIT.COM|`|JVvnET59aa	You'll be just fine!!!|`|xtieIDTyaa	You should be fine, Although you sound very unhealthy... I would try to stop smoking as much as that if i were you, But I'm not you and that wasn't your question, So i apologize, Hehe..|`|b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	No you will not be ok because you're on your way to an early grave.  Why do people expect to be healthy but they choose to live unhealthy?  Makes absolutely no sense to me.|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	The doctors won't give it too you if you are too much at risk. There is always a risk with anasthetic but they should go over that with you.|`|6c9CyuX9aa	Okay, I'm from the States, but if I recall correctly...10 stone is 140 lbs. so if you are 2 stone overweight you are only 14 lbs. overweight which isn't too terribly much.  20 cigarettes is quite a lot.  That's 2 packs over here (don't know how many there are to a pack in the UK)  You are young...you should be fine, but make sure your physician and the anesthesiologist both know how much you smoke so that they can monitor your breathing properly.|`|HNdJfNYMaa	as long as you dont mind having rotting lungs, nasty breath, and dying at the age of 40, you can keep up your habbits with no worries =]|`|cEaM6LXraa	Firstly you need to try and stop smoking, dont just give up straight away, just cut down by 2 or 3 fags a day for like 2 weeks and then lower it until you can finnaly stop, use patches etc to help.    Try and eat a bit healthier, 2 stone overweight is not that bad to be honest, just like vary your foods with salads and fruit etc.     I would try walk to the places that you drive to and are near to you, if you have an ipod just plug that in and it keeps me busy, obivously you cant do anythng to places you have to drive far away to,     Try do things active as well, like im not getting you to join a footy team or whatever lol just like try organise something with ya mates like swimming or bowling or donw the gym    You will be fine anyway
ceeNqETqaa	If you had unprotected sex then there is a chance you could be pregnant,of course!    I would wait a week or 2 or even 3 maybe before testing...|`|u7o75zipaa	Okay,   Chances are you won't be, because of the time you had sex in your cycle, but it's possible.  Wait until next month, and if your period doesn't come do a test.|`|zhk8o514aa	Ew. I hope your cycle was done.|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	Most unlikely! Probably about a 1 per cent chance, if that!|`|gOm09Bqsaa	it is possible, i would take a pregnancy test asap to be sure|`|sGsRLenhaa	its unlikely but not impossible...conception normally takes place around fourteen days after the start of your last period....but sperm can live inside you for up to a week....so it depends on your normal cycle i.e when u would be ovulating on whether or not you would have become pregnant...you can buy & take an early pregnancy test a day or so before your next period is due...good luck x|`|8uiH6iRbaa	i very much doubt it as you had only just finished your period so you wouldn't have ovulated just yet     may i suggest that you try some form of contraception as the pull out method doesn't always work as semen can leak from the penis way before he cums x x x x x|`|QhTUyI37aa	you have to wait at least a few weeks before you can take a test. and yes you can be pregnant if you had unprotected sex. even if you still had your period you can still get pregnant.
iLrp65oXaa	If at 16 you have back problems you need to see a doctor.    A recumbent bike is good for people with back problems as the back is supported the whole time.|`|AA10700407	I walk almost every morning for about 45 minutes and have lost 65 pounds.  I also watch what I eat and drink more water than anything else.  you don't have to run to lose weight.  you could also try yoga or tai chi. riding a bike or swimming would be great. swimming would burn the calories and not strain anything.|`|OHDXO5Dsaa	I would say maybe get on the bicycle.  You are pretty much stationary the whole time only moving your legs.  That is a good form of cardio with the least body movement I could think of.|`|BdhOvKaAaa	Try swimming. It is very low impact and burns lots of calories.
Fsq9qvkqaa	It is all about waiting, your period won't start until your body is ready. Some changes that you can keep track of are: breast development, pubic hair, and discharge. By breast development, I mean "Breast buds" or deposits of fat behind or around your nipples. Pubic hair is self explanatory, and discharge will usually last a few months or up until a year and a half until you acutally get your period.  Ask your mom or aunt or sister(s) (if you have any) when they had their periods, and you might get yours around the same time.  Besides that, don't wish your life away! Enjoy your time not having yuor period, becaust trust me, periods are painful and annoying most of the time!  Good luck :]|`|NoZAofgOaa	omg! you do not want ur period. i got mine last month,   Ugh. i thought i wanted it. but no!    and no thats not true!|`|Ng4UNMV7aa	Myths.    You'll just have to be patient.
muRI850haa	Go to WalMart or any other grocery store. There should be a section usually located near the pharmacy and makeup sections. Look for female pads and tampons. You will find brands like Always, Kotex, Tampax, Playtex, ext.     You should probably start out with pads first instead of tampons, just until you get used to having your period. The thinner lighter pads should work just fine for you. Look for pads that are labeled with "regular". When you get it home, there will be instructions either on or inside the package about how to use them.    A mom or grandmother or any other woman you trust should be a very helpful source to ask questions of.|`|8VRaPH3Faa	um...    with what exactly?    get a tampon or pad and use it. If you don't know how, there are instructions on the box.    If you have cramps or something, get a midol or tylenol.|`|gvRsdjtUaa	uhmm.. use pads or tampons.  use heating pad or midol for cramps.  idk, you arent very specific with what kind of advice you need.|`|5Xvy3ZD2aa	I'm guesing it's your first. lol  DON'T FREAK OUT!   It's totally normal!!!!!  Just wear pads/tampons(don't sleep with tampons in)  Or ask your mom.. or even friends that already have it!  It's nothing to be shy about..  ( :|`|RSWbsE0gaa	when i started my mum got me started on tampons they help them be less pain-full and you can swim with them in as well, they normally last for 5-6 days maybe 7, if they stay really heavy after 3-4months go to your doctors, hope this has helped x
wXKs94nDaa	I'm sorry but I dont think there are much things that they can eat in common. The only thing I can think about is eggs.     1 egg = 2 points.     But tell you mom that weight watchers is a better way to go.
vxTcvSYdaa	It depends on how tall you are, really. I'm 16 and I weigh 160. I'm not fat, I play soccer, softball, volleyball, and I run track. I'm not a thin girl by any means, but i have the muscle I need, and I dont have extra pounds around my thighs or stomach (aka for i know i look good in a bikini!) lol.    Check out these websites:    http://www.mypyramid.gov/mypyramid/index...    http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyw...    It will calculate your BMI and etc, and you can also make a personalized food pyramid!    If you do feel like you need to lose a little weight, here's some great abb workouts! (these are the ones I do, and I have personal experience to vouch for the flatter tummy!)    http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/workout/a...|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Seems about right. Especially because you have muscle.   If you are worried about being fat maybe start jogging a few days a week. You will feel good and maybe you will be happier with your appearance|`|AdTnizwOaa	You're not fat, you're healthy. Besides, you have Altot of muscle and muscle is heavier than fat. On the bmi chart you would be normal =]|`|SHEjVIrUaa	no im 14 and i weigh way more than that. It all depends on your height, how big your bones are. When people guess my weight the guess 70 pounds off. So it all depends|`|eXMOLn9vaa	No!!!  I think that's about perfect, but it really does depend on your height.  Your only fat if YOU think you are.  If you do though, your wrong, because 137 pounds is not fat.    What does it really mean to be "fat" anyway?|`|F4rD4HF0aa	nah ur good|`|0X9x5YrOaa	depends how tall you are.|`|S9aY6xLKaa	Weight has more to do with your height than your age.  To get a good idea about your weight you should check your bmi (body mass index).  I'd say you should be over 5' 7" if you weigh 137.|`|QzyUTwq8aa	Muscle weighs more than fat.   and who cares if you're fat?  as long as youre happy thats all that should matter :)|`|TQ2yjsdiaa	well, you need to go on google and search "BMI Chart". You will be able to figure it out by the directions on the web page.
odhBeflZaa	Dood Eat alot of protein alot of meat....  Thats what i usually do and hit the pool n do sum laps...
XiZIY585aa	Ok, I'm not a woman, but.....I was once told that you can press the button for the elevator a hundred times, but it still doesn't come any quicker... :) Now, on to helping you two enjoy each other more....    Just so you know, the feeling of orgasm (for men and women) is similar to the feeling you have when you need to urinate. So don't be surprised if you feel like you have to pee. It's really your body getting ready to explode. And certainly don't feel badly about letting yourself "pee". When the body gets close to orgasm, the urethra (tube that carries urine) is shut pretty tight so that the body can generate the orgasm. Although, don't be surprised if you do pee a little. It's ok, and very natural.    Have you attempted masturbation to see if you can easily bring yourself to orgasm? Use your fingers, or a toy or heck even a feather if you are so inclined. If you are able to, and it doesn't hurt when you do it, then teach your man how to do it in a way that does not cause pain.     Is your clitorus being well lubricated? Is your man bringing up your natural lubrication during clitoral foreplay? Perhaps a liberal dose of K-Y may help.    If his fingers are causing pain, ask him to use his tongue. It's much softer and infinitely more moist.      On a different note. As clitoral stimulation is a great way to achieve an orgasm, an even more fulfilling experience is with G-Spot stimulation. If you are unsure of your G-Spot's location, here's the place...towards the front of your vaginal wall (about 1.5" - 2.5" from the vaginal opening) is a slightly ridged area (sorry about the explanation, but its kind of like a soft washing board). This ridged area becomes a bit more defined when stimulated. And even more so as you come close to orgasm. The sensations you'll experience are like no other.    But the number one thing to do is to talk to each other. It can be embarrassing to talk about that kind of stuff, especially when you two are going hot and heavy, but believe me, if you both take the time to listen to the other you'll find a much more satisfying experience.    And my final piece of advice. Too much of a good thing is no longer a good thing. If your clitorus is becoming sore from over massaging, have him move somewhere else. The point being that you don't want him rubbing the same place in the same way all the time. Mix it up a bit, some clitoral stimulation, then some G-Spot stimulation, and plenty of all around vaginal massage.    I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|grBxTsK6aa	I think this called an orgasm.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	Yes, there is that point.|`|wlgRsZpfaa	ORGASM... god, don't have sex if you don't even know THAT.|`|CpotQhwkaa	im pretty sure that is an orgasm. i cant tell for sure because i cant feel it, but thats what it sounds like.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Try being more gentle and delicate in touching the clitoris.|`|x3EPqezJaa	Direct stimulation might be too painful for you. When it gets painful, indirect stimulation through a layer of skin or something might be better.|`|Ky99KA8Raa	eewwww girls are icky|`|KDyG2vCoaa	maybe its your period? i dont know|`|QCdpBqhHaa	Ummmmmmmm...it's called an orgasm?  I'm pretty sure...tell him to do it very gently...maybe he's beeing to rough that you're not fully enjoying it like you should. Tell him to take it easy when you're close to feeling that way again.|`|8VRaPH3Faa	You probably had an orgasm.    You can try using a vibrator so that way it doesn't hurt afterwards.|`|PX4KlDQhaa	I have the same problem sometimes.  Here is my solution.......do it yourself in front of him while you have intercourse or foreplay.  You may be a little self conscious at first, but I promise your man will LOVE it and you can finally experience the big "O".|`|vCbOzvGVaa	You fix it by finishing :D  keep going, it will feel good?!::!:!:!|`|F4rD4HF0aa	hurd that from my wife lol lol,  keep skin over ur clit don't let him rub it derect it will hurt and don't have him put to much pressure on it...just like sex start slow lol|`|5cad55284c0036f9d151822f938e2f79aa	Its normal, just give it some time....|`|pjBt8tFLaa	yea try different positions or maybe he is too big or too rough|`|EKdbK3Fsaa	orgasm|`|kI36WRdoaa	i think i know what you are talking about. i would get this feeling too. sometimes it would feel like i had to pee. but it felt good at the same time. other times it felt like weird temperature wise..like everytime it touched there..idk it was weird. but i always stopped to soon to find out|`|HijQu2lAaa	this just means that hes been going at it too hard for too long.  he needs to be more gentle and help you finish.|`|P6WvViFjaa	You could have an allergy to latex if you use a condom. Also, it could just be the pace and position at which you are having sex. Try switching it up, and if nothing changes, I would go to the doctor just to make sure.|`|StX8xylaaa	you shouldnt be doin that unless your married|`|FSKiPO1Laa	it could be ur period im going throught the same thing|`|RMJ5OtO1aa	It sounds like this is an orgasm honey.  Practice yourself and see if you can find the spot that is painful.  The lower clitoris is more sensitive than the exposed upper part, ask him to rub more gently and use his tongue more for gentle stimulation.  Unless of course you like this... =D|`|iAO4ERvGaa	have him be a bit more gentle, so itll feel great and not hurt you!|`|e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	When you get that way, you should let him know that he needs to be gentle. Sometimes, the constant stimulation can be handled if there is less pressure.You dont want your honey to continue to try to please you without climax. Maybe you can talk to him about it out of bed and when you are not engaged in the act.  I HAD the same problem.     If you are at least 18, you can contact me through my profile and maybe I can give you a couple of moves that worked for me.
pCcklqj2aa	That must be quite a disappointment. Trust me, you will never recover form this if you don't do something about it. Try following the list I've prepared for you, things most probably should be better:    1. Visit a sexologist. Sometimes the problem might be physical.   2. Make a list of all the things that turn you on. Try including weird fantasies like: rape, incest, multiple partners, voyeurism, having an audience, etc. Now, fantasize while masturbating; everytime you lose interest try changing the fantasy.   3. Have sex with your partner or a trusted friend (if you are not involved). Try to analyze if you feel the same way.  4. Abstain from masturbating, at least for a week or two and then try it.    Hopefully by doing all these things you will learn new things about yourself and your sexual preferences. I honestly feel that your body is trying to tell you that its not interested in what you are doing right now. Let your body decide what's good and what's not.|`|AA11635314	Imagine in your mind an old grand-pa type man passing his old dried out purple tonuge through his broken yellow false teeth for a loooonggg french kiss. Then he says, "I hope you don't mind but I streak my shorts wannna tear them off with your teeth?  I believe this simple thought will prolong the joy.|`|ARJ5HL9caa	well when you masturbate your butt get tighter right so this might sound odd but while you masturbate use the handle of a hair brush or something else round and put it in your butt hole and keep it from tighten and it make it easier to orgasm and it well make it easier to go for a long time|`|Q3Hueg49aa	I am not a woman, obviously, but I think it has a lot to do with your state of mind.  Pleasure for women is a function of how they feel emotionally and not so much their physical state.  Aside from that, you might try a vibrator--it does the work for you.
L2NLOWYGaa	the main causes of hemorrhoids are chronic constipation with excessive straining,,less fiber diet,spicy food, etc so don't strain a lot and eat fibrous food(salads vegetables or packaged fibres from stores) ..drink plenty of water per day..|`|2bOP8Fdnaa	Stay away from spicy foods, alchoholl and nicotine.|`|rnZoebKQaa	see a doctor. he will probably have you undergo a colonoscopy. a colonoscopy is a procedure in which a fiber optic scope is introduced to your rectum while you are under a mild anesthetic. The scope then allows the doctor to see where the blood is originating. If the blood you are experiencing is bright red then it is most likely a hemorrhoid. If it is dark in color it may be something a little more serious.|`|grBxTsK6aa	You need more FIBER in your  diet.  And wait until you REALLY have to go, stop STRAINING and FORCING. lol...seriously.|`|RQc8fbjbaa	Witch Hazel helps or Tucks pads|`|pYpXj7gOaa	go take a visit to your doctor.|`|HB8uby7xaa	eat lots of fiber, or take laxitives for a few days, make sure you keep that clean. if it doesnt go away after a week go to a doctor who can have it removed.|`|s4psKJrPaa	well ive had some kinda stomach prob, i had rectal bleeding...3 times too, it kept coming back! are you on an antacid? if not, you should try it, try umm wats it called....prilosec, thats what i used, and it helped! you can get it over-the-counter, and if its not strong enough, take 2, or you could get a prescription strength one. but if you already are, then nvm lol. well i didnt have hemmoroids, we found gastritis, except apparently it had nothing to do w/ da bleeding HAHA. ummm ya. i could prob help more w/ more info.    hope i helped!|`|mNJFttV6aa	Been there done that...ok, next.    I went through the surgery to remove the hemorrhoids...VERY PAINFUL!!!!!!!!   That was before the current techniques though.    The best suggestion that I have for you is to drink plenty of fluids and eat plenty of vegetables & whole grains ie wheat, barley, brown rice and bran cereals.     Roids don't just happen, they are the result of poor nutrition, minimal or no roughage and dehydration...lack of water.    Someday you'll thank me!  I've had 2 babies since then and they are now grown, I don't bleed any more but the effects of the surgery are not ever going to get better.|`|AA11210405	go to the doctor.|`|i1JVe24Oaa	yahoo answers: not helping  pharmacy: helping      take the hint.|`|nwRG3N8Maa	Contract the Perenium|`|coj54cacaa	You can bleed A LOT with hemorrhoids. To be sure that's where the blood is coming from you probably should see a doctor.|`|welQ5nSqaa	Try Web MD you can research what to do and what causes them, also make a doctors appointment and have them treated.|`|hY3JlKKaaa	you might have hurt a muscle. this is realtively common, your doctor should point you in the right direction.|`|f7l9byFGaa	For most external hemorrhoids, home treatment is all you need. This includes slowly adding fiber to your meals, drinking more water, and using over-the-counter ointments for a limited time to stop itching. You also may use stool softeners. The same home treatment can be used for most internal hemorrhoids.    If your hemorrhoids are severe, you may need other treatment. The doctor may tie off the hemorrhoids with rubber bands, scar the tissue around the hemorrhoids, or put a shot of chemicals in them. These treatments reduce the blood supply to the hemorrhoids so that they shrink or go away.    Healthy habits can help you prevent hemorrhoids or keep them from getting worse. Eat foods that have lots of fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Also, drink plenty of water, and get some exercise on most days of the week.
B3jacMDeaa	Take a home pregnancy test (if you can get one right away).  If it says that you are pregnant, it could be an ectopic pregnancy.  This is very dangerous and needs to be dealt with right away.  I'm not trying to scare you as it's pretty rare and there are plenty of other things that could be going on--but if this is the case you don't want to wait to do something about it.      If the test is positive, or if you cannot get one, call your doctor right away, even if the office is closed.  They will have an answering service and can have the doctor call you back.  He or she might send you to an emergency room.    If it says that you are not pregnant, call tomorrow to make an appointment.  Make sure you tell the receptionist about your symptoms so he or she can determine how soon you need to come in.    Is your IUD one of the ones that releases hormones (like Mirena)?  If you just had it put in, your body could still be adjusting to the change in chemistry, but you should still talk to your doctor.

b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	If she hasn't seen a doctor then how do you know she has pneumonia or that she has spots on her lungs?    That being said.  Pneumonia does not go away on it's own.  If it is not treated it will get worse.  I do not know how old your aunt is but pneumonia can be fatal for young children and the elderly.  Also, if not treated pneumonia is know for having a "point of no return."  Which means that if so much of the lung has pneumonia then it is nearly impossible to cure.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	So she has seen one doctor that ordered an x ray and found the pneumonia. I am assuming he/she put her on antibiotics. This needs to followed up with another x ray and visit to the doctor. Don't minimize this. Get her back to the doctor or at least call the original doctor and ask when he/she wants to see her for a follow up.
zQiYKgMLaa	it's different for everybody because it depends on a lot of variable factors.    The answer is directly related to your Basal Metabolic Rate and is increased by your activity level.  The more you weigh, the more weight you'll lose, the smaller you are and the less muscle you have the less weight you'll lose.  Being active will help you lose more weight than being sedentary.  Also you age, sex, and height factor into it as well as the state of your current metabolism.    I think the answer to your question can best be summed up by explaining that you need to consume or expend 3500 calories in order to gain or lose 1lb of body fat.  That means that in order for someone to gain 1lb in a day, they need to consume 3,500 calories above what they burn.    The other part of your question is what's known as the Basal Metabolic Rate.  It tells youhow many calories your body would burn if you just laid on the couch all day.  You can factor in activity level as well and it will give you a good outline of how many calories your body will require to maintain it's current mass/structure.  For a 15 year old girl who weighs 110lbs at 5'6 and is moderately active, she'd need to consume about 1,500calories per day.     From the examples above, if that girl did nothing more than stop eating, but maintained activity levels (nearly impossible to do), she'd lose a little less than 1/2lb per day.  These losses would slow every day as he metabolism shuts down, energy and activity levels decrease, and her weight decreases.  Eventually the body will begin digesting muscle instead of fat in order to cut down on it's daily caloric expenditure while storing as many calories as it possibly could.|`|749a489dda09a15d224ff2a0f3c8b462aa	Not a lot, actually.     I've tried that. It's maybe like 1 pound a day. It's not worth it, in other words.|`|hNShT9yhaa	7 pounds a week, then once you eat again you'll gain about twice the weight back.|`|0Wn5Cg3Vaa	you wouldnt loose that much weight because after three days ur body adjusts to not having food n start burning calories slowly but u could loose abt 5lbs in the first few days my suggestion would be that u either starve for two days then eat normally for one day n do it again and again to confuse ur body or eat six times a day but only take five bites of whatever that way u can trick ur body yea hope this was helpful|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	The facts would be based on you as an individual. no matter what it's not going to be healthy.   If you are already skinny you'll be hurting yourself more than someone who is fat because you have less fat on your body.
LMDCm6kuaa	14 is way too young to be worrying about diets.     Your body is going through puberty, and will probably change a lot within the next four years.     Your BMI (body mass index) is 22.3, which is a VERY good number. In fact, it is right in the middle of a healthy weight.     Instead of dieting, try joining a sports team, or working out with a group of friends.

AA10358331	People who are pron to acne can get it any where. People can get it on their back and chest from excess sweat (which also starts happening during puberty) and it gets trapped on the shirt, thus clogging the pores. They can be treated the same way someone treats zits on their face.|`|D8uGioFAaa	acne is mostly genetic-people who take great care of their skin can have it and people who treat their skin like **** can be clear. it kind of sucks, but that's the way it goes.|`|mMDatw1Faa	seriously i have them on my face only Idk about OTHER parts
Khd6Wrbkaa	I think your symptoms are consistent with acid reflux, although I am not a doctor.  When I had similar symptoms, the doctor and he me try different medications to see what could help.  I never went through any type of testing.    I definitely suggest that see your doctor again.  Acid reflux can cause a lot of damage when it's not taken care of.  In the mean time, try not to go to bed right after you eat.  Wait at least 2-3 hours to give your stomach time to digest your food.  Avoid caffeine, and spicy foods which weaken the muscle that closes off your stomach.  Also, elevate your head and upper-back (so that it is higher than your stomach) when sleeping.  This helps keep the acid down in your stomach.    Good luck!      Hope this helps!
Gem96NQyaa	When you're eating more for your "snack" than you are for any other meal, you're not eating nearly enough.  I doubt you've had even half of the recommended daily amount of calories.    And generally, when you go light on breakfast and lunch, you're supposed to eat a normal-sized dinner... not cut back even more.  Quite starving yourself and learn something about simple portion control.  Too little is just as bad as too much, especially if you're trying to loose weight.|`|8JbwkZZpaa	Of course you should eat dinner. What are you trying to follow? Low cal, low carb, etc|`|uUj9yKFiaa	The second you eat anything with the least bit of fat your body will keep it, so I would start eating some food with a bit more protein.|`|f21733d268f623b7683a507c37ec873caa	As a doctor, I would suggest that you head directly to your nearest       Mc Donald's and order a 1/4 pounder.  When you order it add 4 patties to it for an additional 4 bucks.  It would be good for you.  Get a super-size fry while you are at it too.  Do not get regular soda though.  Order the diet.  I wouldn't want you to over-do it now...|`|zSdeMhvAaa	erm no? absolutly not!|`|C88VCkvnaa	You definitely have not eaten too much; in fact, you've eaten too little.

NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about. The main thing is to stick in there. You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off. I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.    Nothing works, besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.    First, depending on how much weight you need to lose, your diet is the first concern. You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off, even if you are exercising a lot. Which brings us to the next thing. Duh, Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight. Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising. Do some cardio, in the long run, it's good for the heart.    However, I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off, in my diet. It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies. I've found a great addition to help any one out, it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol. Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work. That is true, but not in this case. This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch. It's an appetite suppressant, along with being a fat binder. I saved money on the pills at theweig htlossplace.com along with getting some good info. It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar. For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full. Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.    Well good luck and remember what I said, Dedicate.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	I heard that it works, although I read that if you eat any greasy foods, its not uncommon to, umm....soil yourself...?|`|ofJ8IBjfaa	It really doesn't do much for hunger.

I've even ruined a few pairs of panties, but that's a small price to pay for dropping pounds.

01Mu3wUeaa	Well, you don't have the flu.    There is no such thing as the "stomach flu".When people have the stomach bug, they have Norwalk virus.    Noro only lasts 24 hours or so and that's it.Perhaps your body is trying to get back into the groove of things.    As for the PMS, nobody here knows your cycle so ther is no way of telling.    Norwalk prevention:    "Norwalk virus"  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	if you had an intestinal virus... it won't be out of your system for another two days.  Your diarrhea will continue unless you start replacing the bacteria in your gut that the virus wipes out.  You can do this by eating yogurt three times a day, or by getting probiotic capsules from the drugstore and taking them three times a day.
278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	If you want to do something gentle and work up to a "cleanse," that might be best.  If you just jump straight into one, it might be too much for your system.  It's usually not best to even do a cleanse unless your bowels are "open."  What I mean by that is you are NOT constipated.  Constipated is NOT just having a difficult time going to the bathroom, as most people assume.  If you do not have 2-3 bowel movements a day that are of a decent size/quantity AND are easy to expel, then you are constipated.  If your bowel is "open" you are going, typically, once for every big meal you eat (thus 2-3 times a day).      At any rate, if you can determine from this that you are "constipated," then try something gentler first to get things moving.      Make sure you are avoiding refined and overprocessed foods (twinkies, brownies, frozen dinners, fast food, white breads, etc.).      Eat a good fiber cereal in the morning at least 3-4 days a week (bran, shredded wheat, etc.).    Eat a small baggie of mini carrots every day (or other raw vegetable that you enjoy - or eat a salad 4-5 times a week).    Eat one raw apple every day (apples would be best, but if you don't prefer them, substitute another raw fruit - fruit cleanses your system - the apples are high in fiber - best if eaten raw).    Make sure you drink plenty of water during the day and cut back on sodas or other non-nutritive drinks.    If you do this for several weeks, you should notice that your bowels are "open" and could better handle a "cleanse."|`|OHDXO5Dsaa	It is very good to have a clean system it makes it feel like you just walked out of a very nice and clean shower.  Acai berry and wheat shots are an excellent way to speed up metabolism and they also are packed with ant-oxidants.  It is a nice a refreshing feeling.  I aslo heard that going to a sauna helps cleanse your system.  Makes you sweat out all the nasty stuff.

BNAzjSO1aa	Any concussion could lead to a coma, obviously it is not good for anyone to have repeated head injuries. Does she wear a riding hat?  perhaps she needs to be more careful and try to see if there is a common cause that links the concussions ie is she trying to jump a fence? See the link below for more information I hope this helps|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Doctor is not for sure on that one. He is just relating the statistics.    Yes, even one concussion can put people into a coma. any one of a dozen concussions can do that.    What sort of horseback riding is she doing? Steeplechase? You  probably cannot get her to quit, so you will have to live with the problem that she might be in coma on the next crash or not.    My information comes from living on a ranch where we used and trained horses for many years. Some of my cousins are half "brain dead" from the many times they hit the ground hard, but none of us has ever been damaged so badly we went into a coma.
eIyFz2tQaa	You have to see a dentist who has signed up with the invisalign company. They will take as many as 10-15 impressions (a paste like substance that will be used to make models of your teeth, mouth, & palate) of your current mouth and take digital pictures of your teeth and profile. They will send all this info to the invisalign company & it can take up 1 month to hear back. The invisalign people- not your dentist- will then send about 20 different trays (kinda like a mouth guard) and a schedule of when to change the trays. Typically you change your trays (top & bottom) every 2 weeks. Each tray will then move your teeth to a straighter position.     Your dentist will also put small "abutments" or little anchors on 2 of your upper teeth so that the trays stay on the uppers. They are usually white but they stain VERY easily with coffee, coke, & tea. He will just be in charge of monitoring the improvement but does not do much besides this.    Just to inform you, the invisalign people straighten teeth but traditional braces (the ones where you have a bracket on each tooth) actually straighten out each tooth individually, especially if any of those teeth have rotated another direction. Traditional braces can also fix your bite and TMJ (if you have jaw problems)     That is why the invisalign process is so short compared to traditional braces. I personally would not recommend invisalign if you truly want to straighten your teeth the right way since the cost can be almost exactly the same with less results. Invisalign DOES work, but the benefits do not seem to match the cost :-(
8JbwkZZpaa	You need good shoes. Keep the laces loose. Drink lots of water. A good exercise for circulation is....when sitting or laying around do the alphabet with your feet.

B3jacMDeaa	Most often pills sold as ecstasy are not purely MDMA (the chemical name for the drug).  They can often be adulterated with methamphetamine, caffiene, MDA (a hallucinogen similar to MDMA).  These are all "uppers" so they have an effect somewhat similar to ecstacy.  The pills also contain a filler like sugar.    In reality, there is no way to know what is in a pill before you take it (unless you test it first).    **EDIT: the poster below me is wrong.  A while ago a study came out purporting that ecstacy use caused holes to form in the brain.  A little later, they realized that the subjects had accidentally been given meth, not ecstasy, and it was the meth that had caused holes in the brain.  This isn't to say ecstasy is not bad for you, because it affects your brain chemistry in some very serious ways.    Here is the wikipedia article on the retracted article about ecstacy and holes in the brain: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retracted_a...|`|4hr9JGAdaa	ecstasy    ecstasy (aka Methylenedioxy-n-methylamphetamine) usually comes in tablet forms filled sometimes in capsules are as powder.  try googling what is in ecstacy, because, thats all i know about it.|`|cb5cb44a2fed0fb2497e1f4a938b8bffaa	Unless the pill is considered 100% pure (street name Molly or md-ma) it can be cut with a lot of bad things such as crack, cocaine, or heroine. This particular drug is a very dangerous one because it actually forms holes in the brain itself. While the trip may be interesting it is extremely dangerous not only because of the fact that it can cause holes but also because if it is cut with something nasty then it can kill you the first time you use it.
vxTcvSYdaa	The most you can lose naturally, without damaging your body is 2 lbs a week.

Besides, the more gradually you burn the weight off, the more likely it is to stay off. You should aim for a loss of about 2 pounds a week at most.  A pound is 3500 calories. That's a hell of a lot of exercise right? But the everyday activities work towards it.    PS: Don't try diet pills. They actually can give you heart problems.

AA12109717	I think you should relax and look up just how rare Naegleria Fowleri infection really is. In fact their hasn't been a documented case of this in the United States since 2006. In the past 10 years I think we only had 5 cases recorded. Also it's very unlikely that the soil from one your potted plants had the one species of ameba that are known to infect humans. Finally the people that have contracted Naegleria Fowleri all got it from being in the water; like while swimming.    Now had you actually contracted this infection 2 weeks ago you would have some symptoms but since you didn't describe anything abnormal other than the fact your nose hurts and bleeds from you constantly blowing and irritating it.

Whether you are eating, drinking, sleeping, cleaning etc... your body is constantly burning calories to keep you going.      Metabolism is affected by your body composition. By body composition, I mean the amount of muscle you have versus the amount of fat. Muscle uses more calories to maintain itself than fat. People who are more muscular (and have a lower percentage of body fat) are said to have a higher metabolism than others that are less muscular. For example, let's say you have two people who are the exact same height and weight. One exercises on a regular basis with weights, in addition to aerobic exercise, and has a low percentage of body fat. The other never exercises and has a higher percentage of body fat

09b317729060c9dedb69f8059c07c3d0aa	1.) Have you considered the fact that you may have LADA, or "Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults"? In other words, slow adult onset Type 1 diabetes? Unfortunately, many adults who develop Type 1 diabetes in adulthood (it can happen) are misdiagnosed as Type 2 diabetics. If you are thin, active, eat healthy, and needed insulin injections relatively soon after diagnosis (and especially if your levels are difficult to control), then I would suspect Type 1 diabetes. Your doctor can do special testing to determine this. You may need to see a specialist. It is entirely possible that you were misdiagnosed. Sadly, this happens more than one would like. And if insulin is not given in time, it can be fatal.    2.) Just a correction, a Type 2 diabetic CAN NOT "turn into" a Type 1 diabetic. Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes refer to the disease process/etiology/cause, NOT the treatment (I.e. if insulin is used or not). That is a very common misunderstanding.  Although a Type 2 diabetic may go on to need insulin, their treatment changes, but the cause of their disease (and hence the name) does NOT. They are still a Type 2 (insulin resistant) diabetic.    Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. It used to be called Juvenile or Insulin Dependent Diabetes. There is no known way to prevent it, and there is no cure. It is not related to lifestyle choices. Onset is *typically* sudden, and it most often appears in childhood. There is a complete insulin *deficiency* and multiple daily injections or a pump are required for life. The genetics for Type 1 diabetes are different from the genetics for Type 2 diabetes.     Type 2 diabetes is a disease of insulin resistance. The body does not respond to the insulin it makes at a cellular level. Often insulin levels are *high*, but the body cannot properly use the insulin it makes. This is the more common form of diabetes. Being at an older age, being obese/overweight, not exercising, and eating a poor diet are risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. The genes for Type 2 diabetes are different from the genes involved in Type 1 diabetes.     Over time, some Type 2 diabetics do go on to need insulin. Some of this is due to those who did not make lifestyle changes early on, while other cases are due to a more aggressive disease process (i.e. genetics) or other reasons.    Note that not all people with "Type 2 diabetes" are overweight. About 10-20% are not. Reasons for this include strong genetic disposition (certain races like Asians are prone to it), misdiagnosed Type 1 diabetes (which is not caused by obesity), or rare genetic forms of diabetes like MODY.     3.) All of that said, YES, a Type 2 diabetic who needs to use insulin daily can very well wear a pump. Regardless of which form of diabetes you actually have, in your case it sounds like you would benefit. If you were a "typical" Type 2 who could benefit from weight loss, diet control, exericse, etc. I would suggest that before adding insulin to the mix. Type 2 diabetics are insulin resistant and usually have already higher than normal circulating levels of insulin, so I'd be cautious to add more without lifestyle changes first. You want to correct the issue, not add to it.    BUT, in your case (assuming you are not a misdiagnosed TYPE 1 diabetic), if you are truly a Type 2 who needs insulin and has tried all other options, a pump is a great way to get better control. If you are truly a Type 2 diabetic, it would appear as though lifestyle is not the issue in your case. You would likely do well with a pump.    Some advice:    -Get tested to make sure that you are not a misdiagnosed Type 1 diabetic.   -See if you can get a prescription from your doctor for a pump  -Call the major insulin pump companies and ask if you can "try out" a pump using saline (salt water) and ask for an info pack. They should send you out a pump information kit.   -Speak to your diabetes educator (or local educator) about pumping,  -Join a diabetes support group, ideally a pumping group.    So yes, you can get a pump if you are a Type 2 diabetic. There are some Type 2 diabetics who use a pump.  But only your doctor can decide if a pump is right for you. So do some research and ask. In the end, you and your doctor will have to rule that this is a good choice for your particular case. I suggest you direct any other questions to your doctor and medical team.     Good luck!|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Absolutely!  Your body needs what it needs.  Some people get by with diet and exercise, others get by with meds, and some do best with insulin.  Talk it over with your diabetes educator and see what they think.  If you don't have one, ask your doc for a referral to see one, they are wonderful.|`|8OqdoIHtaa	I'm a type 2. I am insulin dependent. I take Lantus once a day and Novorapid 3 - 4 times a day.     Yes, type 2's can become insulin dependent after years of diabetes, or they can be diagnosed when its too late to save their pancreas, and need insulin right away, (like me).     Yes, type 2's can use insulin pumps, but personally, I hate the idea of being hooked up to a machine, no matter how small. I'd rather use the pen and syringes I use now.     Learning to use a pump isn't easy, and requires just as much testing as injecting with a pen or syringe does.     Its also terribly expensive. I just don't think its worth it. Its not worth the expense, the hassle,  or the fuss.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Most type 2 diabetics who use insulin only need it at mealtimes so are unlikely to need an insulin pump. I have to inject 2 a day and the insulin I use contains a short acting and a long acting insulin. I am sure there might be an odd occassion when a type 2 needed a pump but I can not think of one. I am a type 2 and have been on insulin since I was diagnosed and I know of other type 2's who require insulin. The MAIN difference between type 1 and type 2 is the age of onset and in type 1 none or very small amounts of insulin are produced. see web site below|`|1wFMGizXaa	Yes. Any insulin-dependent Type 2 can use an insulin pump.|`|RGRmNR3kaa	I know the pump looks cool and glamorous but it's only for those who need insulin all the time, not those who can control their diabetes with diet, exercise, oral medication, and the occasional injection.  Sorry.|`|cASB8Sh3aa	It is true that many type 2 do not need insulin but the longer they are type 2, the more chance they will end up on insulin.  The pills lose effectiveness and the pancreas stops making insulin that the body can use at all.  If you are at this point and are put on fast acting insulin and multiple daily injections then you could go on a pump.      It is a good option for you since you are on insulin now.  You will have to be willing to test your blood alot and count your carbs.  One issue type twos have with the idea of the pump is the amount of testing that is required to use a pump. You will have to test 8 or more times a day to have safe, good control on a pump.  I am type one and I test 12 times a day.  This allows me to have super tight control and eat whatever and whatever I want now.  It also allows me to have an A1C of 5.8.  I feel better and can do more than ever.    Talk to your doc and see if they offer a pump education class.  Many endos offer this and it will help you decide if a pump will fit your lifestyle.  Good luck!|`|RP2QQXbjaa	Type 2 USUALLY doesn't require insulin (of course there are exceptions to every case and some type 2's need insulin)  but I'm not sure about the pump.|`|pRF5LLloaa	One of the characteristic differences between Type1 and Type 2 is insulin usage.    Type 1 Diabetics require insulin, Type 2 does not.    I is very common for a Type 2 diabetic, after several years of being Type 2, to eventually have to go on insulin.  In this case, it is usually because the pancreas "wears out" from being overworked, and the patient is now a Type 1 Diabetic.    So generally speaking, Type 2 Diabetics do not wear pumps -- because they do not need insulin.    If, at such time that the pancreas fails and the Type 2 moves into Type 1, THEN a pump might be appropriate -- but in reality the patient is no longer Type2 but has become Type 1.    The major reason that a Type 2 diabetic would become Type 1 is that the patient is NOT strictly following the dietary and exercise regulations and/or medicinal routines prescribed by the doctor.  this causes a great deal of strain on the pancreas, prompting it to fail.  IF the Type 2 Diabetic were to pay STRICT attention to diet, exercise, weight loss, and medications, the body usually returns to normal and the pancreas would not fail.    Many doctor prescribe insulin to the Type 2 Diabetic early in the program, with the goal or reducing the blood sugar rapidly, As the patient gains control of their lifestyle, the insulin is reduced and eventually eliminated.  These patients do not need a pump for this short (6 month or so) duration.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	were you just diagnosed?  try to lose the weight first. if you don't, you will become insulin dependent like Orange Evil and be stuck with insulin.  you can control it even though she wasn't able to.|`|OXybxCLraa	I don't know why these people have to be so rude.  Obviously diet and exercise didn't work for you.  No big deal, contrary to the beliefs of these self righteous ones, it doesn't work for everybody.  Yes, there are many type 2's on the pump.  I don't know your particular situation but it could be an option for you.  A good resource for info is insulin-pumpers.org.  Good luck to you.
e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	Some people dont get to their full size until they are in their 30s because of the various hormone changes. If it happens every now and again and goes away, it may be a PMS symptom. I know when my cycle comes I go to a B cup and I am barely an A cup. They also are so sensitive that it hurts to take off my bra. I have no tips for that. If you find a way to decrease the sensitivity, let me know. I get it a full week before I start.    If you are really concerned, you should go see the doctor. If you notice that it only happens around your cycle, you should be alright. Just document what happens to you for three months (soreness, fullness. tenderness, fatigue, or whatever you feel) you may just find that it is around your cycle. This info will also help your doctor determine if there is a problem or not.|`|QXt1zUiFaa	Your probably still growing or pmsing|`|kubvXL3Iaa	They are sensitive because there are a lot of nerves there.

AA11048920	There is none whatsoever. HCV is caused by a virus. No one knows what causes MS. Researchers think that those of us who get MS have a predisposition to it although that is only part of the story. We then come into contact with something in the environment that sets the disease off. MS is an immunological disease that effects the nervous system. HCV is a virus that attacks the liver.  That is it in a nutshell.|`|AA10213842	No there isn't however....I could see how they may be misdiagnosed  because the two totally different diseases (environmental-MS and HCV-viral) can often cause some of the same symptoms.
D0OBjou4aa	Don't worry. Be happy that you are short. Loads of people are really tall and wish they are smaller. Big things come in small packages-I know exactly how you feel. I am sooo short. I am shorter than everyone in my year, I don't like it but I put up with it. Its really annoying because all my friends are tall so I look really weird. lol.|`|DCNFAzzxaa	Totally get you.  I'm 17 and barely 5ft. My younger sister who is ONLY 10 is nearly taller than me (embarrasing huh?) My friends all get in the bars and I'm to afraid to try.  But just think of the famous saying!

Just keep staying fit and healthy is the best option. I'm one of the shortest in my class, it's not all bad.    Other than that there is a surgery but you wont be able to get it in the UK or the US and it's expensive and very painful and dangerous so please - do not think of that.|`|BEac9ZFkaa	u can grow no worries exercise~|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Your potential maximum height was determined at the moment of your conception by your genetic make up.

BNAzjSO1aa	It is possible that a vein was damaged when they took the blood is there a bruise around the area? If you live in the uk I would ring NHS direct on 0845 4647. But it is probably nothing to worry about|`|f8sUtNVGaa	If there is no swelling, stiffness, redness, warmth, or inflammation, the phlebotomist may have hit or damaged a nerve during the venipuncture.  This can take several days to resolve.    If you have any of the above symptoms, you may have phlebitis, or inflammation of the vein.  Only a physician should evaluate and diagnose this condition.    I have been donating blood for over 20 years, and several times a phlebotomist has hit a nerve with the needle.      If you are donating blood again and you have discomfort like you describe, tell the phlebotomist immediately.  He/she should be able to tell whether a nerve, or the blood vessel itself, is involved in the pain.
d3VV4b6vaa	oh brother, they have a name for everything now.  yes you can do it, I did it through willpower. I really wanted to stop picking and whenever I'd start, I would hope something would make me stop, to the point it actually started to work. something would always distract me (a phone would ring, my cat would knock over something, someone at the door etc...)  Hide mirrors that you use to look at when you pick...if you have an extractor, get rid of it. trim your nails to the point where you can't pick your skin, or grow them longer if that helps too (i.e it'd be too painful to pick even if you tried)|`|yE2vM76naa	You can want something all you want, and that wont make it true.

There is a way out of that hell - - but you need a new map on how to get from where you are to the other side of this.|`|ACyl5uQMaa	This sounds like a form OCD (obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and millions of people suffer from little bad habits. OCD is basically a bad Habit and remember, millions of people have it in some form so your not alone. It is hard to beat a bad Habit, especially when it has been going on for a long time, but there is always hope and ways to beat it.     1) - Take it one day at time, try and pick a little less each day and when you do good, reward your self with something you enjoy doing (mine is video games oohhh yeah)    2) - There is no shame in seeking extra help, this is because the sensors in your brain have developed to this motion and feels as though it is a natural way to do things. Do get help, because millions of others do!    3) - When your mind stimulates you to "remember the picking" try and say "This is not necessary, I didn't do it for the first 12 years of my life. and take your mind off it. It's just a matter of helping train your brain to discipline it's self and say "no"    Remember this is hard to do but you can do it! These are just bad habits that we can break, it may take a while but it can be done and please, seek extra help if needed, you will thank yourself
09xZIXDsaa	it depends on what you mean by that.  it filters through several organs before getting to your brain, where the fun happens.  but it isn't "stored", per se, as in it doesn't just sit there for years, collecting in your body like alcohol, LSD, and chewed gum (kidding).    if your concern is less about health and more about passing a test, then you have little to worry about.  typically when people get in trouble for pills they've taken on drug tests, it's heavy amounts of sedatives and opiates (hydocodone, codeine, oxy, any prescription painkiller).  valium is just diazepam, which is what dr. house always orders for people having seizures.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Drugs are not usually "stored" in the bodys organs, however if you take a drug test each drug will be found for a different amount of time.

lCF87NfDaa	im 18 and i think ive been growing since 16...ull probably be a bit over 6ft|`|AA10045887	What you eat has no effect on height growth. It's all in the genes you inherit from family, not just your mother and father. My parents were both short, but my brother and I both are over six feet. We got our height genes from our grandfather.|`|GoCcTiyDaa	If I remember rightly I shot up when I was in the old 3rd/4th year at school (years 9/10 now). Then I stopped - yah!!!! I remember being one of the tallest and then ended up one of the shortest when everyone caught me up and overtook me. I think your parents are a very good guide to what you'll end up - typically nowadays people grow taller than their parents - because of better nutrition/etc. - because you're parents are around 5"8 then I expect you'd end up a few inches taller. Maybe 5"11 might be it - hopefully you'll get to that magic 6". I'm fairly small, 5"7, but it's often a blessing in disguise when on public transport and other stuff. I think 6" is a nice height in that you'll tall but you won't have too much problem getting clothes or having to duck under door frames or anything. Good luck with it.
EZ5mwUF3aa	Try Amlacting lotion 12% (at drugstores or drugstore.com) it is very moisturizing and helps soothe and calm the skin.|`|AA10045887	Don't take hot baths or showers, use humidifier as the dry heating will dry the skin and use moisturizing products made for dry skin, including body wash and hair products.

Mine gets the same way all i have to do is put lotion on like three times a day and then it's fine....Just try and resist the itch and don't scrach it and your skin should be fine.|`|9gxzPlZZaa	Well the same thing happened to me and the Doctor said not to take HOT showers and he said don't dry my skin all the way with a towel just tap it with the towel then to put some vaseline on, Yes regular vaseline it is greasy and nasty but believe me in a couple of days skin is good and itch is gone. Also he can take a bath with baby oil that seems to help also, just  be careful because the shower can get very slippery. Hope this helps.

HWtG9dkzaa	The numbness is to be expected if you've had a local anaesthetic - your mouth is going crooked because of the numbness - the muscle isn't fully awake - so its not reacting as it should.

f8sUtNVGaa	Yes.  Womens' urethras (the tube from your bladder to the outside of your body) are only 1-2 inches long.  See the image in this article:  http://www.gynecare.com/bgdisplay.jhtml?...    The movement of the penis rubbing against the outside of the urethra during sex can force bacteria into the urethra.  You have a lot of bacteria in the area outside your vagina; this bacteria isn't harmful unless it gets into your urethra.  There it can cause irritation and infection.    The best way to prevent a urinary tract infection?  Right after sex, get up and urinate.  Urinate as forcefully as possible to force out any bacteria that may have gotten into your urethra.  You may also want to choose a position for intercourse that minimizes the penis rubbing against the urethra.|`|dAn9koABaa	,oh you poor thing , yes you shure can , tell him to be gentle , sometimes a little bit of rough can be nice but you pay the price, sorry if that sounds bad but its true|`|kF5WGHxvaa	ask oboma he wants to spend 250 million of bailout money on them|`|EsaFg8eaaa	Yes! his hands can be dirty while putting it on and slipping it inside of you (kinda graphic sorry)|`|2gstVBcMaa	uhhh ya.

Having sex can actually make them worse/cause you have develop one by pushing the bacteria up the urethra.|`|f7l9byFGaa	yes uti's are mostly caused by germs.  Your risk of infections increases during sex even if he wears a condom.|`|P6r4VYVEaa	Yes|`|ikzqudHTaa	urinary tract infections are not infectious, so if your partner has one there is no way that you will get it. The reason that sex causes urinary tract infections is that during sex, bacteria in the vagina can end up getting pushed into the urethra and end up in the bladder. So, no, a condom will not prevent it, and in fact may increase the risk, if it's a condom with spermicide.    The best way to prevent sex from causing a UTI is to go to the bathroom before and after sex. Also, make sure you wash up after sex (but don't use a douche, this makes it worse!), and during sex only use water-based lubricants.
d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	I had the same problem when I first started to try to loose my gut. If I were you and I was a trainer taught me that it is not the amount of weight you use it is the reps and sets during this time.  Rather than doing 50 reps of 170 lbs, why don't you try to do 75 to 100 reps of say like 65 lbs 3 sets and build up the reps not the weight.  If you remember right the abs is the only muscle in the body that doesn't get sore like all the other muscles in your body, you can cramp a stomach muscle but a day later you will not feel sore.

Every morning working about 10 min on your stomach, front/side etc cruches.    3) are there any types of foods i should avoid strictly?  Anything containing corn syrup and sugar. Be aware that even normal bread contais sugar and that you should go for WHOLE grains (not multi-rains unless it says as well whole grain).     4) i m having difficulty in choosing or even finding an excercise regime/pattern.can i make 1 by myself?  Exercise every day, rest one day. Alternate between cardio (cycling, running, badmington, soccer...) and strength training (weights in gim, abs & core classes, rock climbing, power yoga-usually offered in rock climbing gims emphasising strength...) and other like swimming etc... Do every morning 10 min work on your stomach, front, side cruches.     5) what is the time frame i can aim to do this in?  Depends on fitness at starting point, how good you keep up wth the exercising routine and nutrition and of course your own metabolism....    6) which diet is the most effective fat burners?  The before mentioned. A healthy diet wth very small meals, skipping the bad stuff and only eating the nutritious stuff.    Basically you want to sweat wth the cardio the fat of your belly yet still get good nutritients with good food and then built up your belly muscles. My husband got to it wth small healthy meals and rock climbing and gim work out.     Good luck !!!     PS. You should do it for yourself, not for anybody else.

The only way you can get rid of your belly is through CARDIOVASCULAR exercises and proper diet. Ab exercises strengthen your core.  But like I said, if you don't do cardio and diet, even if you wear this contour ab belt for the rest of your life, it won't do you good.  Believe me, the economy is bad enough to spend it on pieces of trash like these.

74vbT0doaa	Your goal sounds realistic for you, though a size six is a nice size.  Try increasing lean proteins like fish, chicken and lean beef, add lots of vegetables and have some fresh fruit.  Fat free yogurt and milk are good.  I think those salad spritzers and butter sprays are good options for salad dressing and fats. Be careful with any starchy or sugary foods, stay away from noodles, pizza, potatoes, ice cream, cookies etc. Eat some fat, but not much.  Olive oil is a good option, but don't fry food or load it with butter or margarine.  Increase your exercise. At your young age you can work out every day, take up an active sport or get on a team at school.  How long it takes depends on your metabolism and your activity level too.  You can lose 2-3 pounds a week easily.  Crash dieting and not eating will mess up your metabolism and make it harder to lose weight and keep it off.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	Your stupid. Starving yourself will make your body go into starvation mode which stores food as fat more often. So no, you will gain weight.|`|xcf9jEsaaa	okay if you starve yourself  my teen living skills teacher tought me that  if you starve youself you get even fatter  beacuse your body thinks that it wont get any food so it holds onto that fat instead of getting rid of it  and its stays there     just exercise  and eat healthy   you'll loose weight|`|nLScNIekaa	just exercise and eat 6 small meals a day and weight will start flying off. starving yourself you will just gain it all back after you stop. also drink a lot of water and it will make you not as hungry|`|BcJpPMPFaa	Say "ASAP" again.|`|dQQGAxvjaa	i think so... lol im 13 and im 92lbs and 5'4 but yah. im younger lol. i kno its not healthy but im losing like 3-4 lbs a day just eating a VERY light lunch and exersizing like 3hrs every day . i just feed my food 2 my doggy at breakfast and dinner. i wouldnt suggest bolemia. not good. my frend went 2 the hospital 4 that. she was about ur height and she weight a flippin 162 lbs. she was only 12 wen she did bolemia. agen, not good lol|`|zNGWFKXGaa	Starving to get thin does not work well because each thing you eat will be stored as reserve by your body (not burned) as he thinks he needs to do that because he becomes too little... does that make sense to you? If you really want to loose weight and get fit and healthy you need to invest time into the matter and start changing live habits for good, not for the sake of a diet! At the beginning you gotta power to loose, then later just keep up wth the maintenence! For the beginning:     - exercise every day, min. 3-4 times/week. rest one day/week.  - alternate between cardio (cycling, running...) and strength (rock climbing, abs & core classes...) and things for long & lean body (yoga, pilates...)    - eat 5 SMALL meals per day! dont overeat ever! cut out everything wth corn syrup and sugar. change to WHOLE grain bread. eat lots of fruit, veggies, fish, meat etc... Use for spicing things up only salt, pepper, olive oil, vinagre, herbs. No sauces, mayo, ketchup etc...   - switch to drink only water and plain milk. no sodas, shakes, alcohol etc...     That helped me to be thin and maintain my weight. But I gotta tell you that it is definively time consuming and it will always be! You gotta integrate these things in your life and make better choices with what you put on your plate.....     Good luck!|`|Gfzzn1Pgaa	The thing is, you say don't say anything 'bad' but when it comes down to it, yes, you will lose weight, but the bad news (for you) is simply the FACT that you will gain it again after that. You say you will keep it under control but you can't change what the body is naturally doing, which is storing fat.     In my opinion, your weight is fine for your height but I know it's personal preference and all that. Please don't starve yourself; I've done that before after being obese and yes, you lose a lot of weight, but if you lose weight that quickly, you have excess skin which you just can't get rid of (trust me) without surgery (which I'll never have; I'm not that vain). You may also get stretch marks etc. You may feel terrible too like did. You may also gain some weight back like I did too, which I'm working on atm, but trust me, from personal experience, it is NOT worth starving yourself, for SO many reasons, but especially if you want to lose 30lbs that you don't need to lose; it truly can be bad for you.

MQJQDBONaa	Yeah, thats too much at once. You should eat your dinner for SURE, all you need to do is cut out the snacks! Plus you are losing weight far too fast, you need to have patience.|`|VH98AKVgaa	You should eat more and not throw it up.... You could get seriously ill like bulimia or anorexia from that..... look up online healthier ways to lose weight..... just eat healthy and exercise alot......|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Hey you answered one of my other questions. So I'll answe yours!    Ok, so the only really terrible thing is throwing up what you eat for dinner. Throwing up causes you're osaphagus and mouth to get unhealthy (idk exactly what happens but the acid from you're vomit causes it to deteriourate.    Do what I would do is Eat a cereal (whole grain/skim milk)  A piece of fruite, and maybe a 1/2 of a (whole wheat/low fat) pb& j sandwhich,    And for dinner have a tall glass of water (fills you up) and then eat the healthy stuff, (such as vegetables)  and only a portion of the unhealthy stuff, so you're mom doesn't get concerned.    And keep excersising!    Just stop throwing up|`|qje4beuBaa	That is very serious. You have bulimia which is an eating disorder.   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa|`|9cIMbdBzaa	Ignoring the bile ruining your teeth and throat. Bulimia (which is what you are doing) is a very bad eating disorder. Your body isn't getting the nutrients that it requires. Also a lot of that weight was probably muscle. Not to mention your metabolism is going to hell. Soon enough I'm sure you'll be running and probably just pass out.|`|GuOJIftAaa	YES! It is very bad. Your body will not get the nutrition it needs causing your body to not develop properly and with you throwing up all the time you'll hurt you throat and rot your teeth out. Please, stop. At 16 you should know the hazards things like this can cause.    Why don't you google some pictures of girls with anorexia or bulimia and see what will happen. I think you need to find a healthier way of losing weight and get some help from a professional for your eating disorder.|`|uUj9yKFiaa	Vomitting up food on purpose will RUIN your throat and stomach for your ENTIRE LIFE.  You don't want that. Instead of throwing it up, ask your mother to perhaps start cooking healthier, because I'm sure you're not the only one in your family whom is a bit over weight. It will benefit not only your health, but also your family's health and well being.

After you are done brushing with toothpaste, brush them with an orange peel.   ( Keep fresh orange peels in your refrigerator in a baggy. Two oranges should last you a week)    There's a toothpaste call White-Brite that works, Pearl Drops, or Rembrant 'Dazzling White' are good toothpastes for whitening too.
BNqbOfBsaa	how tall are you? you should probably first start out by cutting out foods that don't have any type of nutrional value like candy, and chips. also try cutting down your portions :)|`|pwLufnSzaa	You are a little bit heavy for your age. To help loose some weight you should do this. Don't eat until your stomach is like growling to eat. Don't over eat. Eat enough that you aren't craving something. Do not eat after 7:00 PM. And if you can exercise do this at least 4 times a weak. It doesn't have to be working out. It can just be walking for like 45 minutes a day. Don't go on pills. And don't be afraid to join weight watchers. My sister joined when she was about your age. It helps if you doing this with someone else that  is trying to lose weight also. And another thing about eating. Eat like 6 small meals a day, chew until the food is very small, and lay back on the soda and juice. Drink lots of water. I hope this was helpful. Good Luck!|`|h4p2O5CGaa	yes.|`|HNdJfNYMaa	You should eat healthy foods, and excersize a lot.

rKbeXJPfaa	Im not sure.  I know that i started my period about 5 years ago now though, and it is only just starting to get regular. Mine was probably like going 2 months without one for a couple of years. After that it was like it could be 2 days early, or 2 weeks late. Right now, 5 years on, it will occasionaly be right to the day. But sometimes it can be about a week late. All i can say is try eating a healthy diet, and exercising. Getting enough sleep and stuff so that your body is in good condition and can work properly. Try not to worry too much though, although i know it can get very annoying! People usually say it takes a couple of years to regulate, but it took me much longer. If you are really worried just ask a doctor if its normal. Im sure it will be. x

vxTcvSYdaa	If you have a PE class at school, you should join! I've been in PE classes every year from 6th grade to 12th, and I'm in great shape!    If you really want a specific exercise, you should do crunches. Make sure you go on the internet and get a video or something to show you the proper form, because doing them incorrectly will damage your back and neck. The basic mistake you should watch out for is to make sure you're engaging and using your stomach, not your neck to pull yourself up. (Cross your arms over your chest, one hand near each shoulder, to help prevent this)    Also watch out for your diet! A lot of chips like Hot Cheetos and Dorritos, and Chocolates go strait to your stomach and thighs.

74vbT0doaa	Foods containing sugar and starches help you pile on the weight. Think ice cream, cookies, cake, white bread, potatoes, pasta and rice.  Add fats too, like cheese and butter. Try something like a peanut butter malted milk shake with whole milk, ice cream, peanut butter, honey and malt. Of course, eventually all this stuff will make you sick, increase cholesterol and your chances of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.     Losing weight is really tough.  Lean meat, eggs, fish, poultry, vegetables, fruit, lite yogurt, and low fat milk are foods that help you lose weight.  If you are not carbohydrate intolerant, whole grains like old fashioned oatmeal, brown rice and whole wheat breads in small quantities can be added.    Stay healthy!|`|C88VCkvnaa	Peanut butter, nuts, high calorie drinks, etc. are great to eat when you need to gain weight.

You will speed up your metabolism but as long as you keep eating it wont matter.  Consume the calories and make sure you get alot of good fats including monounsatured, and polyunsatured.    Dont gain weight to fast, just consume about 500 more calories than you burn a day!  Get alot of proteins, and good fats. Before you go to bed make sure you get some carbs. Such as rice and fruits.

f8sUtNVGaa	1.  Deodorant/antiperspirant works by killing the bacteria that live in your armpits.  Everyone can actually have slightly different bacteria in their armpits.  Sharing deodorant can spread bacteria from person to person.    2.  Sharing razors can be dangerous.  There are bloodborne diseases as serious as hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, and some STDs that can actually be spread by sharing razors.  You can also spread warts by sharing razors, since warts are caused by a virus!    Show your mother this Answer, and she may be convinced!|`|r3mFOMmgaa	Just tell her that when you use the same deodorant between more than one person it can spread odor and bacteria, making conditions worse.

fk9AvB25aa	It is curable with over the counter medication such as Monostat or Canesten. Your body can get rid of the infection, but it may take longer au natural then with some thing to help it out. They can be caused by a bad diet, frequent drinking of alcohol, and they can be passed during sex. Men can get them too but not as often as women.|`|f6fCixDnaa	It is definately curable and is not an STD!  It results from poor body hygenie or if you combine the pill with antibiotics.    Buy diflucan oral, its a pill and you swallow it. You can buy pessary (inserted into the vagina) but most people just prefer to take the pill and have it all cleared up in no time, rather than insert a gel pill up themselves..or squirt goo up their ******** lol.    You body wont get rid of it on your own, but dont worry you dont need a script. I dont know about america. but in australia you can buy it at most chemists (although it is behind the counter) You wont find it on the shelves you have to ask a pharmacist for it.  Its best to clear it up soon :)    ~Naomi~|`|MhpccWpmaa	it's definitely treatable! and not an std.... next to bacterial vaginosis a yeast infection is the second most common infection among women.  i would reccommend asking for Diflucan when your doctor prescribes you medicine. It's one pill that you take which takes a couple days to a week to clear it up completely but it works and works well.  Other than that your other option is to use suppositories over the counter but those aren't fun because you have to use them for several days and they can be messy. They've never worked for me either, diflucan is my preferred route.  To prevent YI in the future eat a yogurt with live cultures everyday, wear cotton underwear, don't douche or use regular soap down there--only warm water or feminine wash, and you can also take acidophilus supplements everyday which can help prevent it. hope i've helped!|`|RP2QQXbjaa	It's a curable infection that can be treated with topical cream or oral antibiotics (i.e. Diflucan).  You should talk to your doctor about treatment options.|`|Zas9WXNwaa	It's very curable.  Your doctor will prescribe or recommend the best course of action for you.  If it's vaginal, there are over-the-counter medications for it.  Ask the pharmacist.      Best of luck!|`|d1jMmApmaa	Yeast infections are absolutely curable.  Yeast is fungal rather than bacterial so antibiotics will do nothing for a yeast infection (except maybe intensify fungal growth).  You'll need an anti-fungal to clear it up as yeast infections don't clear up on their own and your body will not clear one without medication. Also, if it gets really bad, over-the-counter Vagisil or Monistat may not provide complete relief. If you don't find relief with over the counter medications, check with your gyno.    Good Luck!  Hopefully you'll find some relief.
AA11020187	Its because we dont know what causes cancer.  You may be having a hard time finding anything at all as eye cancer isnt a medical term for any sort of cancer its just a general location. Its better to look for the type of cancer you want information on such as conjunctival lymphoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, etc.

UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|oluzjSgjaa	hormones and stress can affect how you feel about sex.   you are better off not taking medicines, and relying on natural feelings to dictate how you feel.   some times your monthly cycle can affect the way you feel.   give it 2 weeks and see if the situation improves.|`|AA10672349	There is some good info at this site|`|HLjQCwXXaa	apparently ginseng helps boost sex drive.     sometimes i take it because it helps increase energy, but i've never taken it before having sex so i don't know if it actually works for boosting sex drive, but its worth a try.     you can buy it pretty much anywhere that sells vitamins and supplements such as the grocery store, a health food store, or a drug store.     also, some types of energy drinks and teas have ginseng in them. i would recommend trying diet pepsi max, it has ginseng in it and it tastes good.
xYTagSIyaa	I do not live in the USA so I cannot tell you anything related to your government.  What a can tell you is I believe your depression is from things that have happened to you in the past that have not been resolved.  True depression is a chemical imbalance that you have no control over without the help of medications.  I believe your depression may be best treated with therapy.  You may be able to get this therapy from a qualified professional or you may not because of financial difficulties, I don't know.  You could also try and join a group of people who suffer similar problems if you have any such groups in your neighborhood you could join.  If this is not an option for you, you could join a group of people on the internet that have had similar problems.  You may also find some help by talking to friends or family members.  Remember, no matter how bad things get, you are human being, worthy of giving and receiving love.  Remember you have a family depending on you.  Remember your life is important to you and your family and to the world as a whole, you deserve a good life.  You may have to fight to get what you want in this world, so be prepared to do so.  No matter how bad things get, there is always a new day and new hope with it.|`|iybezfi6aa	Apply for disability before you apply for welfare if you still can.It is easier to get welfare that way.

09xZIXDsaa	there's nothing you can do at home that fixes sweating.  dermatologists can give you shots that reduce sweating and medications, but there aren't antiperspirants.    the home solution remedies usually just cover up and odor or dry out your skin to a put that they're just chapped.  baking soda and cornstarch are to mask the odor, not prevent the sweating itself.  you might want to give gold bond a shot though, if your problem isn't too bad.  if it's heavy, then you'll end up just getting chunky gobs of powder in your pits.  applying anything after just removes it.|`|AA10137467	That's supposed to be used as a dry powder, as a stand alone. It works, sort of, but is rather messy.    Zinc deodorant is a less messy deodorant, that is also non-toxic. Lemon juice & grain alcohol in a spray bottle is quite useful, and leaves no stain. Clear salt deodorant is my favorite, because it continually kills the bacteria which causes odor, and leave no mess behind. Get the roll on type though - the rock kind sometimes doesn't cover as well.    None of the above actually reduce sweating though. Be sure to get checked for any medical conditions and eat well. Herbal remedies and homeopathy can also help. Good luck!
xYTagSIyaa	No, I don't think so.  A cast will increase the likelihood of problems associated with immobility.  If all your x-rays are normal, and your doctor has told you the truth, then it likely is not a fracture or arthritis.  This would mean it could be one of two things that I can think of. It could be a nerve problem, this is not likely but possible.  The other thing it could be is repetitive strain or compression when you are sleeping.  When you sleep do you sleep with your hand under any thing where it could be compressed?  If you are, this would explain why it would get better when in a brace.  Could you not find a more comfortable brace and wear it when you sleep?  Consider carefully how you position your wrist throughout the day.  Also I would consider increasing the vitamin B and C in your diet for a month or so, to see if this helps, I mean like 500mg in the B's and 1000 mg's of C.  Just for 1 month to see if this helps.  Some people have found great success with this for carpal tunnel syndrome, so much so that they did not require surgery.  I might be tempted to try a specialist or a different doctor and new x-rays if I were you.  Another thing you could try is a Q-ray bracelet, some people have found success with this or magnetic bracelets.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	No, a doctor puts a cast on breaks only, for a reason.  A break must be kept in a stable position for 4-12 weeks depending on the severity to the bones and the severity of the break.  Your wrist may hurt, but its not broken, and you need to move it occasionally or it will begin to 'atrophy' which will cause you more pain in the end.  If you are at the computer frequently and have a 'straight' keyboard, get and learn to use an 'ergonomic' keyboard.  Take an NSAID (ibuprofen, aspirin, ketoprofen, etc.) and see if that doesn't relieve your pain.  Try doing 'range of motion' exercises, with and without a soft 'exercise ball' in your hand, and after you can 'move with little or no pain' move up to a 'weighted ball' and keep doing those range of motion exercises.  I suspect that what is 'causing' your pain is something you do 'every day' without thinking ... you could be resting your arm/wrist at exactly the same place while you are eating dinner, or you could need to get a 'keyboard slide' to lower your keyboard (as well as an ergonomic keyboard).  I know what is 'wrong' is a nagging pain, but you can't and shouldn't rely on just the doctor to 'fix it' ... try taking a week 'off' from doing things you do every day, do the range of motion exercises and take the pain pills, and then when you go back be so 'in touch' with your body that you can identify what it is that is causing the (most) pain and change that one thing.  Do that until you have changed enough to be virtually 'pain free' as you go through your day.  Don't wear a sling or a 'brace' while you are doing this 'self-examination' because it won't 'help' and may actually do you more harm than good.  I know ... I have 'severe carpal tunnel syndrome' in both wrists ... but I have NO pain since I bought a good chair, a good desk with keyboard slide, and got a good ergonomic keyboard.  Now I rarely have pain ... maybe 1/2 day in every three years ... and I simply take a half day off and I'm fine again when I come 'back to work.'
oaiL6vnuaa	once, when i was i young boy, my father allowed me to tag along on his whaling ship. It was a rough day on the fair seas, and i, a boy of a mere twelve years, was feeling fairly apprehensive. I prepared to make father proud, but i could not shake that feeling that we were fated for a sudden and perilous doom. as we took to the sea a raging storm ensued. the great ocean set a great many waves upon our small ship. as our ship was tossed by the waves, i saw in my head the fleeting image of what would soon occur. as i shook the image from my mind, i looked out to the sea, and what i saw caused me to tremble. many a trout advanced forth upon our small sea craft, and we prepared to do battle. five and twenty trout boarded our ship, and Father fought valiantly, with great fervor. alas, our mighty crew was slain, with i the only survivor. i was cast into the sea, as a message in a bottle, fated to die, with my lungs flooded with the salty brine of the sea. i lost consciousness, and floated, alone, for what may have been many days. alas, i awoke, an ocean's gargled vomit upon the shore of a deserted island. and here i have remained, for these 12 long years, plotting my revenge upon these cruel soldiers of the sea. i have spent these years, amassing my army of ship rats, and it is nearly my time for vengeance. for now, you shall know me only as the whaler, but you will hear of me soon. my name shall echo from village to village, and all shall fear me.

AA10834367	Here is my opinion (whatever it's worth)     1) Maybe you saw a ghost. If you did see a apparition, most likely it is not there to harm you. THe spirit is probably seeking help. It does not know why it's there. However, since it was able to show itself in true form, it must be somewhat powerful. Does you room ever get cold at night?      2) Maybe you were in a state of alertness, but were still dreaming. This happens a lot with sleep walkers. They are alert enough to walk around without tripping, but are still dreaming.      3) Maybe you had a very vivid dream, and you thought you were awake and seeing the girl, yet you were fast alseep.     Personal note: I used to sleep walk when I was a child. I was found in the living room, building something with blocks. I was also found in the back yard playing in the sand box. This all happened in the middle of the night, and my parents carried me back to bed, without me ever waking up. I had no idea this had happened until a few years ago when they told me (I am 27 now).|`|fWPbql8aaa	there is no way to get rid of it. Just deal with it.

If it is a ghost, that doesn't necessarily mean its evil or anything........      it could also be sleep deprivation, or you could've saw her when waking up from a dream or something, it all depends. wouldn't worry too much in the meantime though. watch for signs if you see her again, but don't get paranoid yourself and play mind tricks on yourself. :)|`|T6RMAlMRaa	do some history searching, about who else lived, if they had kids so on what not from there try to record or evp play it back see what was said, it may be nothing but if it really bothers u and u want to know try these things first.
q9i5f0rXaa	If the soreness has gotten worse today than it was yesterday, you should take a day off.      To reduce the soreness, you can do anything that gets the blood flowing:  stretching, walking, light cycling....even a hot shower will help.  By getting the blood flowing, you'll both supply your muscles with nutrients and flush out waste buildup in the muscles that's causing the soreness.
C88VCkvnaa	Focus on eating more of healthy and high calorie foods. Gourging yourself on junk food is not healthy and will only cause you health problems later in life.  Some good foods:  Peanut Butter  Nuts (Almonds, etc)  Calorie-rich drinks (milkshakes, whole milk, juice)  Increasing your portion size  Lean meats for protein    Basically eat more of healthy food. Make sure you get enough calories. Perhaps add in some weight training to get some muscle weight.     I included some links for you if you want to check them out. :)

XhIYAH6Laa	Harlequin-type ichthyosis (also harlequin ichthyosis, ichthyosis congenita, Ichthyosis fetalis or keratosis diffusa fetalis), a skin disease, is the most severe form of congenital ichthyosis, characterized by a thickening of the keratin layer in fetal human skin. In sufferers of the disease, the skin contains massive, diamond-shaped scales, and tends to have a reddish color. In addition, the eyes, ears, mouth, and other appendages may be abnormally contracted. The scaly keratin greatly limits the child's movement. Because the skin is cracked where normal skin would fold, it is easily pregnable by bacteria and other contaminants, resulting in serious risk of fatal infection.    Sufferers are known as harlequin fetuses, harlequin babies, or harlequins.    The harlequin-type designation comes from both the baby's apparent facial expression and the diamond-shape of the scales (resembling the costume of Arlecchino), which are caused by severe hyperkeratosis. The disease can be diagnosed in the uterus by way of fetal skin biopsy or by morphologic analysis of amniotic fluid cells obtained by amniocentesis. In addition, doctors can now usually recognize common features of the disease through ultrasound, and follow up with 3D ultrasound to diagnose the condition.

6NA2MXNPaa	I'm sorry you're having so much trouble with that tooth, I can totally relate! I had the same exact problem with mine, but mine slowly got infected over a period of 15 years. Right after the crown was done, it just didn't feel right. I had switched dentists and my new dentist kept telling me that my bite was off and kept adjusting (filing down) the crown so that I wouldn't hit it when I ate. Every time I went in and saw him I'd tell him the same thing, it still didn't feel right, had a little bit of pain when I hit it, but overall, I didn't really know how to explain what was wrong. This went on for years and years. Finally, about 2 years ago, the right side of my face swelled up so bad that my eye swelled shut from my cheek being so large. The infection was horrible, to the point that I could smell it and people around me could too. Ewww. It was gross! Needless to say, the first dentist that did my root canal didn't get all of the root/nerves out. My new dentist explained it to me saying that most teeth have 3 roots and they clean the nerves out that are within those roots when they do a root canal. Every now and then a tooth will have a 4th root hidden in a place that is unseen. If they don't get that 4th root cleared out then the infection will remain there and just continue to get worse over time. Because you have 3 of the roots cleaned out, it will feel better for a little while.    Typically what is done is your dentist will send you to a specialist called an endodontist to "re-treat" the root canal. Because the crown is permanent and can't be removed, the endodontist will drill a hole right through the crown just as they would with a regular tooth. Then the endodontist will go in and go a little further into the depths of those roots than what the original dentist did. You may have to have some antibiotics before going in for the re-treat, I know I did.    I hope that helps. Sorry for the long answer. Don't delay, take care of it right away. Hope you feel better soon!|`|EK6nBv18aa	So, first of all let me tell you it's great you have an appointment to see your dentist again.  He will definitely take an x-ray to start diagnosing the problem.  You said that you had a fracture in the tooth, sometimes dentists try their best to remove the whole fracture or follow it until they find the end of it but the problem with this is that a fracture can be microscopic and dentists have human eyes, so he may not have removed the fracture completely.  Another possibility is that your root canal was successful for the time being but failed in the long run, this can be caused by multiple issues, you may have an infection at the root of the tooth again and you are now feeling pain from the PRESSURE building up in the bone around your tooth. This can very much feel like your tooth is aching and also make it feel like it is trying to be pushed out as you mentioned.  He may suggest doing an apicoectomy, which is like doing a root canal from the root up instead of the crown down to try and plug the ends of the root and clear out the infection, this would be a last effort before extraction.  Another reason may be an issue you are having with a tooth next to it or your sinuses which both can cause something called referred pain.  Referred pain sucks because it can make things feel like they are hurting when actually the cause of the pain is coming from somewhere else.  We can get referred pain because the nerves in your face look kinda like a hand and it's easy for pain to travel from one area in your face to another because the nerves are all connected...almost like your body gets a little confused.  Unfortunately, there is a real possibility that your tooth may need to be extracted, root canals and crowns are not a 100% fail-proof method of saving a tooth, but most of the time it is the best way to try and save a tooth and works a large majority of the time. (by the way, when a root canal is done the roots are not removed but rather "hollowed out". You have very thin canals in the roots of your teeth that hold a nerve and blood supply to your tooth, if it becomes infected they are removed and packed.  Since the vitality of the tooth is removed with that blood supply a crown is placed on top to ensure your tooth stays strong and doesn't start to become brittle and break from lack of blood)

F4FCBEgzaa	My 1st simple guess would be that you are less than 5 feet tall and the average chair that you sit in is designed for people who are taller. Thus, the edge of the chair is affecting your circulation and/or nerve paths to your legs.   A more complex guess might also be a lower back problem (like the 1 that I suffer from). Either way, a trip to a medical practitioner (traditional/chiropractic/holistic) would be wise.,|`|VyQX9EAhaa	I used to have a huge problem with back pain. i was unable to sleep some nights and so i tried out this new thing called the turtle, it helped out a lot with my back pain. i dont know if you believe me or not but it definitely made my life a lot easier.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Check your blood sugar.

Bw5ZwYtPaa	Since you have time before the swimsuit season, I would recommend taking your time on losing the weight - you keep weight off better if you do it in a longer span of time rather than a quick fix, so you might find yourself gaining it back again before swimsuit season actually starts!    An easy way to take it off in a speedy manner (though it may take a little longer than a week) is cutting out snacking in between meals, watering down juices, and limiting sugar intake. Wherever possible, drink water instead of snacking between meals. Eat meals like you normally do, but instead of a snack, drink watered down juice (limits the sugar intake of the juice AND makes the juice last you longer so you aren't spending as much!). You don't realize it, but snacking generally can cause you to either gain weight or maintain a weight when you could actually be losing because snack foods tend to be quick fixes that are high in sugar and preservatives.    So basically, eat like you normally do except for those times when you're eating just to eat. We often snack because we're bored or even thirsty - the two things can often be mixed up - so drinking water or juice helps with that.     Also, when you're looking at the weight change, always remember to weigh yourself in the morning before you shower.

ufgv7oTjaa	Yes, Minerva is right that Cherries have good antioxidant support and can help with acidity levels... but the primary benefit is for joint health. Cherries specifically help to metabolize Uric Acid, which is a fairly common joint irritant, so there are millions of people world wide that either have used or currently use Cherries to keep their joints comfortable and moving smoothly.  Between the juice and the capsules, you'll typically get a bigger impact from the juice unless the capsules are an extract or a concentrate. Some people prefer the juice (for the impact and/or the taste) and some people prefer the capsules (to avoid taste issues, for convenience, etc)... it's really a personal preference for that.  If your friend swears by them for another reason, feel free to ask me about that. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|ToztjpAsaa	It's just cherry juice.  What's so special about that?  Marketing nonsense designed to deprive the gullible of their money (no offence intended).    http://www.cherryactive.co.uk/|`|duVTqRM4aa	I checked out the website and thought it looked good.  When I read this I was impressed:    "CherryActive Capsules are made from 100% Montmorency cherries, in a 100% vegetable capsule (no binding agents, fillers or additives whatsoever)"    That's a very good sign.  When shopping for supplements, look for it to be nonsynthetic and no fillers.      Cherry juice is high in antioxidants and cherries in Chinese medicine are kidney builders.  It gets acids out of the body.
lEXTHOZPaa	How to get six packs abs fast and look amazing. Guys, get those chisled abs and have the girls go wild!    Six pack abs are usually developed initially through indirect stimulus. These exercises include squatting, dead lifting, overhead pressing, pull-ups, dynamic rows, and bench press. Six pack abs are the sculpted muscles of the abdominal region. Only a good diet will result in the look you desire. Six pack abs are compacted and the buttocks gathered under to correct the angle of the pelvis.    Six pack abs are obtained in two parts.    First part is diet and it?s best to eat low sugars and many small meals. Six pack abs are in big demand right now. However, in terms of attaining a six pack of abs in relation to building a bigger chest, sculpting your abs takes a little more work, education, and discipline. Six pack abs are heavily commercialized these days through movies and ads, and everyone would like to have one. Hence the search volume on Google is high on these search terms.    The second one is desire and discipline.

AA11955868	Ugh. I hated that. The grossest stuff got caught in those things.The syringe works great, my dentist actually supplied me with one, I assume because he'd experienced the salt water swirling and it's minimal success.    I don't think there's a real specific technique, I usually just tried to swirl it around shooting into the socket, I could sometimes see what I was trying to shoot for so I knew where abouts I should aim. I didn't ever stick the actual syringe in the socket, maybe that's a obvious point, but you never know.     It was usually a little uncomfortable for me, pain wise, for a little bit after hosing them out, but I don't think you can over clean it. If you're still worried about it, I'd just apply less pressure to the syringe so the water lands a little softer, but I don't think you need to worry much. Also I'd try and stick with warmer water, just in case your teeth or socket are a little sensitive.    Have fun : P    **I wouldn't rinse each bite. Not so much to worry about over rinsing as it's just a pain in the neck. I usually just flushed 3 times a day as I didn't bring the syringe with me every where it went.

Stick w/ just whole grain bread and a thin layer of peanut butter if you really want it to work well in a diet assuming you're trying to tone up and lose weight.|`|8RlYLfy2aa	Sure, peanut butter is high in protein to keep you full, use wheat bread, and a little bit of jelly cant hurt, but bananas would be even better.

77YF9YDdaa	As you've had this for as long as you can remember it is most likely that this odour is not caused by any disease. However, you certainly should have a check for any infection. There are a couple of low grade infections which can be present for a long time which could cause an odour - thrush is the commonest one, but there are several others.     The way to have this checked is to see either your GP or go to a Family Planning Clinic. The doctor can send the appropriate swabs to the lab. If this turns anything up then the appropriate treatment should do the trick. If it doesn't then modern medicine doesn't have much to offer you I'm afraid. In this situation I would recommend you try a homeopathic treatment - you can be referred to see a homeopathic doctor by your GP.    Good luck!|`|DZimLaLuaa	go talk to a doctor right away yo pussy do not suppose to stank or have an odor or just maybe wash that **** SEVERAL TIMES A DAY no harsh feelings|`|KjKqPrTnaa	I agree with Track.    The wetness of women's vaginas varies greatly, and most women think that being wet is abnormal. Remember that a healthy vagina is full of natural bacteria that are beneficial and keep you clean and healthy. Vaginas do have a distinctive smell, but it should not be offensive. If it is offensive you could have an infection (not necessarily an STD) so check with your doc.    I don't recommend douching as that will only make it worse.  There is no reason a woman should ever have to use a douche,
42WmRqNoaa	Many things will help.... better than actual coldsore drugs.    Salt, Herbal Tea Bag, Ice Cube.    When you first feel that itchy feeling when your about to get a coldsore, put a icecube on it as long as you can. This will prevent it from even popping up.    If the sore has already came up and is oozing and such already then put table salt on it... it dries it up really quickly and quickens healing time.    Tea bag works for all of the above.

Gross!    Fast forward 20 years or so and many miles away. I get inflammatory bowel disease and am very sick. Out of the blue, I have a dream about the tea and how my grandmother made it. I call her and do research... low and behold, flax seeds make a mucilage which helps soothes irritated membranes in the digestive tract, safe for virtually everyone. It was probably one of the remedies that saved my life.|`|duVTqRM4aa	Apple Cider Vinegar.

6KYsUxacaa	Same as my school ...  The toilets are just overly rank! And it's an all girls school as well... period pads are just about everywhere, WITH blood.  But I just learnt to use the school toilets-hold my breathe, don't touch the doors(wrap tissue around the handle), buy antibacterial and you should be good.    One day i got a really manky old stomach ache from hold my pee, so you probably shouldn't! [I can even recall a time when I wet myself in Year 4...]    Good luck!|`|gBaSCuRTaa	You are going to end up with with a blatter infection,  and if you keep doing this for a long period of time you will probably end up having to get surgery.    When i was younger i used to hold my pee alot,  because in school we werent aloud to use the washrooms  and i ended up with a major blatter infection and i had to get surgery  and i had to get tube's up me and all this stuff, it wasnt pretty.  it isnt a good thing that you hold your pee,  from my experience i dont do it anymore.|`|BopBYwSdaa	You sound like me?  I hold pee when I was at school till I got home daily.

I already know 3 people who had it (scary)...|`|TvMiwKjEaa	It depends. When I had a full school day I could normally hold it in for the whole day but maybe it's different for girls. I don't think it will cause any trouble. Unless you really do need to go.|`|BLTq0vLWaa	If your actually holding it in for 6+ hours then I cant say that's particularly good for you.

Things Youll Need:  Sore ankle   Ace Bandage     Instructions:  Start with your bare foot, elevate your leg so that you can wrap it easily. Crossing your ankle over the other knee helps hold it up. Hold the end of the bandage against the sole of your foot. Wrap it about three times    Don't wrap it too tight or it will cut off circulation and swell. Next, wrap the bandage around your ankle about four times    Bring the wrap down around the sole of your foot again and wrap twice. Again, make sure it isn't too tight. You want it snug like a tight sock    .Bring the wrap back up around the ankle and continue wraping around the ankle until you run out of bandage. You will secure it with the fastener that comes with the bandage. If you don't have the fastener, use a saftey pin.     Tips & Warnings  Make sure the wrap is snug enough to ease the pain, but not too tight.|`|AA10506024	Start at your foot.. and move upward..   not too tight.. not too loose..  then go all the way past your knee...   it may take more than one ace,  and it is hard to walk once you do your knee.  try not to bend it much..and stay off it much as   possible.  Take care..

I must have been on six different diets. Nothing worked for me. (I am sure it sounds familiar) The change came when someone introduced me to a friend who has been using a program that changed her life. At first I was skeptical, but then when she showed me the before and after photos, I jumped in.   For the first time I found something sensible where I dont have to starve to burn the fat and know exactly how to exercise for maximum impact.   Here it is: www.Fat-2-Muscle.com  Best of luck!|`|QCdpBqhHaa	My partner told me straight out that I have gained a lot of weight since we met 2 years ago.  She told me I am hot, but I'd be even hotter if I was thinner. I didn't take it as offensive at all.  I took it pretty well, because it's the truth.  Even then, I haven't even tried losing weight lol but it's my goal to begin excercising because I really do want to be thinner-and I'm sure your girl does too so maybe eventually she will join you.  But don't push it too much...when she does decide to, encourage, compliment her and tell her how proud you are of her. Good luck!|`|b2588303cd0bf17f0993891608852540aa	Obviously you don't "love her for who she is" or you wouldn't be trying to change her.  It isn't your place to decide if she needs to lose weight or not.  Either get over it or break up with her.  Personally I think she deserves better than a shallow guy like you.|`|Zu4PLS7kaa	Ask her to work out with you. Even if its just a short walk around a neighborhood or park. You could also try biking in parks. Remember start out small. That way she wont notice ;) She may even begin to like walking with you, and won't notice how good just walking is for her.    Edit: No, you are not being shallow. Wanting someone to be healthy is good. It shows that you actually care for her and her being. As long as you don't want her to exercise just for her to look better, then you are not being shallow.|`|xpvFbcJqaa	Well, good thing you are asking first instead of just flat out telling her she needs to lose weight..    My fiance 2 weeks ago told me I ate too much and I needed to work out..I about ripped his face off! And I'm not even fat..lol    Anyways, why don't you just lead by example?    Get her motivated ya know?    Say things like "honey, I'm going to the gym and I'd like you to join me".    Or    Eat healthier and don't take her to eat anything fast or fattening.|`|mO7FOXNYaa	I think Gabrielle said it best.  Start small.    My boyfriend motivated me - but in a different way. I always complain about my weight gain and he would always say " I think you're great, you're crazy."....until one day he snapped! hehe.    He told me, "If you aren't going to do anything about it then Shut up!" It knocked sense into me.     **but in my opinion, do not tell her that you want her to lose weight - just invite her to workouts...and see how that progresses. If she asks, "why? do you think I'm fat?" Tell her no - b/c you do not think she's fat. Tell her that you want her to be part of your healthy lifestyle - she'll feel loved and may end up enjoying the workouts.

Here's my schedule:    5:30: Wake up, work out  6:00: Take shower  6:20: Put on lotion, deodorant and perfume  6:25: Wash face, use a treatment pad, and moisturize face. Brush teeth  6:30: Get dressed  6:32: Do makeup  6:40: Blow dry and straight hair  7:00: Eat breakfast and brush teeth again  7:10: Go to school  2:30: Hang out after school with my friends  5:00: Eat dinner  5:30: Clean room, set out what I'm going to wear tomorrow  6:00: Wash face, use treatment pad, moisturize face, and brush teeth  6;10: Do homework   8:30: Read two chapters of Proverbs (in the bible) and try to interpret it. I'm in the leadership team at my church and this is our homework.   9:00: Write in journal  9:30: Sleep      This is just a regular day. On tuesdays I go to volleyball at 6:00 and don't get home until about 8:45, so I go home early from my friend's house and get my homework done before it. Also, on Wednesdays, I go to my dads house at 5:00, so I have to get home from my friend's house early to pack up. Then later that night, I have church at 7:00, so I try to finish up my homework before then.

But give it a try, it might work for you and at least it will let you see a list of the tasks at hand.
tG0swCe6aa	You can't lose that much weight in 3 weeks.  Its healthy to lose about 2 lbs per week which means you can lose 6 lbs by your goal date.   All you have to do is exercise and eat right.  Its easier when you're younger, you have an advantage.    You don't need access to anything, just get outside and run, play sports or however you like to exercise.  Stick to healthy foods and drink lots of water.  Juice and soda are filled with empty calories.|`|0fviV0lNaa	You should always consult a doctor if you are under 18.  130 isn't that bad unless it's like pure fat and no muscle...|`|bf5c9c9250f194482287548d294c7b31aa	Now, your not gunna wanna hear this (even tho u have about a million times), but its not healthy to lose 30lbs in 3 weeks. Thats 10lbs a week, which is not only hard, but scary. Realistically, you can get to about115lbs, or even 110 if your lucky. Anyways, now for the advice you wanna hear. Simply being physically active helps a lot! Since a 13 year old probably doesnt have constant access to a gym, I'd say going for a 30min to an hour run, or bike everyday to boost up the cardio, and lose weight. When on the bike, try to keep it around 90-100+ RPM. on top of that, a healthy diet is necessary.Eat lots of celery, since its a negative calorie food (burns more calories than it actually has). A few years back, I lost a considerable amount of weight by eating  3 stalks of celery every morning after a big glass of water. Besides that, just be smart. Dont choose fries, go with the salad. DONT SKIP MEALS! And, try not to eat after six. Drink LOTS of water. Good luck.    **ALSO!!!!!  try doing some HIIT cardio. its when you alternate from high intensity to low intensity. (2-3 min low intensity, then 1-2 min high intensity) Just try google-ing it for some workouts. It works really well, and targets fat.
g2yUDLygaa	You can't spot-reduce fat.  Your body puts it on and takes it off in its own way, and wherever you have the highest concentration of flab (for me it's my gut) that's the last place it comes off.    A vegetarian diet is usually good, but is not the answer for everyone (yes, I know many overweight vegetarians).  The trick is to make sure you're not eating more than your body needs and to have your cholesterol checked regularly -- if it's too high, you need to adjust your diet.      You'll also need to add regular exercise.  It's next to impossible to reduce flab without exercise.  You need to do at least 30 minutes of aerobic-level exercise every other day (if you want better, faster results, you'll need to do at least 40 minutes EVERY DAY).  The bike and mini-stepper are all you need for your aerobic exercise.    You can also tone up your midsection and make it appear smaller by adding abdominal exercises.  They don't burn many calories, but they're necessary if you want to flatten out that tummy area.  You need to do exercises that hit all the major muscle groups in your midsection (upper abs, lower abs, obliques, transverse abdominis, and back muscles).  Google each of these terms and you'll find all kinds of exercises you can do for each muscle group.|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	do crunches its like a sit up but you go up further right to you knee. as for your legs go on all fours get one leg first and put it right up to your chin and then stretch it back out do it 30 times and then the other leg|`|6H3zI2bKaa	Try taking walks every day for a week!

You don't need that much exercise you're underweight and you know it. You have posted other things about fasting, etc. So I know you are needy and wanting all sorts of ridiculous attention but grow up and do whats smart.
Dso7k3sjaa	I have a friend who was actually on it and it was working for her, but then she lost her job and couldn't afford it anymore and ended up just gaining the weight right back again.    Well, it can be hard to afford the "right" foods when you don't have a lot of money, so it's somewhat understandable.  Plus, she was depressed about her job as well and that never helps either, right?    Anyway, I think it can help you get started, but obviously if you really want the weight to stay off, you have to learn to eat better and exercise more.  But it might be good to help you get some pounds dropped so you have more energy and more incentive to really change your lifestyle and habits.    Good luck with whatever you decide!  :-)|`|AA11481224	its a diet so no it wont work long term    forget dieting it never works    make lifestyle changes cut back on fried fatty  foods  sugary and salty food and eat more fresh fruits and veggies and cutout or cut back on caffeine from tea coffee and soda    walk instead of driving  take the stairs instead of the elevator

W8v86HYoaa	I would say go to your doctors (however cringe worthy) and explain your situation. They may have to do an examination (I can understand the horror of that realisation) but they may be able to find the problem.

When my cousin got really skinny her periods were just like yours, very irregular. maybe put some weight on of you need to and try vitiams.  No its not normal but the pill has effected your periods. It may take up to a year, at least, for periods to be normal again after taking the pill and that is for a grown woman. Maybe try a well woman clinic they are good for advice if your still worried.|`|jW9N76cSaa	if you are on YAZ get off it right now
xdyM3IVmaa	LOL... no.     We do get more useable energy from potatoes, veggies, and fruits than from eating a cow. That's the whole thing, it's useable. It is digested, absorbed, and put to work right away. Cow meat has little to no health benefit to us, people eat it because of it's taste, inexpensive nature, and the fact that "hey, it's normal". The amount of not-so-great byproducts in meat are stored and left to ferment in our bodies, whereas eating veggies and fruits, those things are converted directly into health benefits for our bodies.     How many obese vegans do you see? Not very many at all. We get more nutritional use out of our food. I can eat three avocados (very high in fat) in a day and not gain weight. Because it is useable nutrition. Constantly pumping our bodies full of meat is just ASKING to get fat.
ZR8htpB5aa	Nononononono!    I was 100% awake during my surgery only got some Novocaine shots and I was just laying there waiting for the dentist to extract. I felt absolutely no pain! I didn't even know what they were doing in there. I just saw random instruments going in and out of my mouth.. But I did keep my eyes closed most of the time because I didn't wanna see anything that was going on really. :( All I felt was pressure.     Don't worry about it.. Absolutely no pain. yes if you wisdom teeth are impacted/slanted (mine were slanted) it will be noted as a "complicated" procedure but that means nothing.. no pain.    Only the recovery (after the numbness wears off) will there be some discomfort and some pain. But nothing some pain medicine can take care of. :)    If you have anymore questions feel free to ask! :)    My surgery was 9 days ago. :)|`|NGz7R9enaa	I had two of my wisdom teeth pulled 3 months ago and neither one of them hurt me.

A lot of pain issues just depends on the actual person and how well your dentist knows their job.|`|0xWAHvKYaa	Hope I have the answer you are looking for, but I was awake the whole time they took my wisdom teeth out.  Now I was drugged up on Valium and was feeling goooood, but I was 100% awake and there was no pain what so ever.  Just a lot of pressure.  I remember laying there and singing songs in my head while they worked away.  They took all 4 out at the same time and they had to cut them out because my wisdom teeth stopped growing in halfway, so they were all still under the skin.  Then they took a drill and broke them into pieces in my mouth so they could easily pull them out.  Lot of noise and some pressure, but totally painless.    The next day isn't so fun though :/|`|150d8852f762d2b17f834aa2bf3cd981aa	The worst part is the novocaine.   I got my top two wisdom teeth removed earlier this month along with two bicuspids and the wisdom teeth came out painlessly.  I am still surprised just thinking about it.  I would not be worried.  As far as I was, besides the next couple hours with bleeding and stuff, my wisdom teeth caused no problems.    If you have your bottom wisdoms removed.  It might be a little more difficult, but I heard you are put to sleep so it might be even less painful than the top.  But it may be harder to take care of post-surgery.|`|RG1B5ouyaa	when i had my two bottom wisdom teeth pulled the only pain i had was when they went to give me the shots of novocaine.But i am not big on needles so the shots are always the worst part lol.all i felt was some pressure and that was it.recovery wasn't even that bad.I was awake the whole time and didn't take any medicine to relax or anything beforehand.
oNXygeVZaa	It's posible to not be in controll of your muscles while having orgasm.  You should proably empty your bladder before you have sex, and that should fix the problem,  Ther's also exercises that you can do to make your lower muscles stronger.

Then when you are out of the shower apply lotion. Every time you shower lotion your body. EVERY time, especially in the winter. If this still does not help then get a body butter with shea butter in it. Be sure not to shower to often as that will also dry out your skin even more and keep it protected from the cold.|`|vMmdIEA7aa	try pooping

pE8oQTWgaa	You could be getting a yeast infection. It would cause sex to be painfull, and you would smell funny down there, kind of yeasty. If you start seeing a thick discharge, like cottage cheese(gross I know) and if you start feeling itchy and/or a burning down there, I'd call it as a yeast infection.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|HZuLVEEsaa	I did the same thing at uni, i sorted it out by cutting right back on the drinking (limit it to one night a week), and be aware of all the things that you eat.

QoVL5cDHaa	To do this healthily you should aim to lose about 2lb a week. That should take you roughly eight months. If you do it too quickly you lose muscle and not fat, and are more at risk of putting the fat on again when you stop.  If you think 2lb doesn't sound much, think of 4 packets of butter, a bag of sugar, or 2/3 of a bag of flour.|`|AA11548204	where are the toning exercises??as long as you dont lose more than 3 lbs a week you`re fine|`|9FyxeA1Zaa	I've lost 50lbs so far over 4 months     Ive turned vegetarian   Drink only water   Eat around 1200kcals a day  Play rugby once a week for 2hrs   Work out for 30 mins everyday in the holiddays and at weekends   School days i do alot of walking so do no furthur excerise     So form my experience around 4-6 months depending on how much you can excerise a day.

This was nearly 3 years ago.  I have since then been able to maintain my weight with ease.    I completely changed my eating habits and embarked on regular exercise.  Two things I had never done before.  The results were absolutely amazing.    I ate a healthy, balanced diet of lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (including potatoes), beans & pulses, low fat dairy products, skimmed milk, sugar free beverages, and non sugary cereals.    I also included more whole foods into my diet.  Such as brown bread, brown rice, brown pasta and beans & pulses.  But making sure I keep all carbohydrates just plain and simple.    I keep all junk foods, ready made processed meals, alcohol, sugary fizzy drinks, and takeaways to an absolute minimum.  These are high in refined sugar and full of saturated fat.      Junk food is just what it says - JUNK.  With one added ingredient in - FAT.    But I also took up running.  Obviously, I had to start off very slowly, (and so should you if this is your first time).  I now run on a regular basis and am running my first London Marathon in April.    But one thing you have to remember though.  Is when you reach your realistic target.  You cannot go back to your old eating habits or activity levels.  Or, unfortunately, you will put all the weight back on again.  It really is as simple as that.  But if you carry on with the changes you will be able to maintain your weight in the long-term.    I wish you lots of good luck and hope you achieve your goal.
nEVoabeSaa	Cultures? Normal they do a slide, take a sample of blood, smear it on a glass and look at it under the microscope. Malaria is a parasites infection, so they can see by a thick smear of blood. However then they would need to see 'which' parasite it is.  Best of Luck
47oF1FCCaa	I read a book once called Mastery, and its point was that we tend to focus on the end result rather than the journey.  You're doing a great thing for your body by exercising, but it's a lifelong journey.  Fact is once you achieve it you need to continue to maintain it.    Just keep at it and slowly and subtly you will simply start to look and feel better.  People will comment on how great you look and your clothes will be looser.      No set time frame exists.  Just keep at it, and you'll get results.  You'll also feel better and be happier, which is extremely attractive.|`|hSOEgpPNaa	Well, I would need to know what you look like now.

NyTkZJQ0aa	Well there's a thing called re-feeding.  Did you go to an eating disorder clinic to help recover or are you doing it in another way?  In the first stages of recovery, your body begins to get the food that it so desperately needs and begins rebuilding tissue with it instead of storing it.  So in other words, you are burning more calories than a normal person is every day because your body needs to use the calories you eat as energy to function AND rebuild tissue.  Most recovering anorexics can lose weight by eating more because of this.  I've even experienced it myself in recovery.|`|hSOEgpPNaa	I don't know but keep eating cuz anorexia sux.|`|AA11806516	it doesn't happen overnight, just like getting skinny from anorexia doesn't happen over night.  muscle takes time to build.  keep up with the eating, but don't overstuff yourself, and you will get there|`|c8cVUppmaa	Be happy, just make sure you are eating HEALTHY if you are binging.

mHHy7Foraa	It's impossible for you to lose 'fat' weight from any specific area, as you automatically burn off the fat from where it was most recently put on as it is all connected or something...    But, Upper arm muscle strength which will help reduce fat wobbling would be to execise your triceps, the bits underneath, by arms behind your head, elbows to the ceiling, and keeping upper arms in that 90degree angle, slowly bring your lower arms up and back down again as in point to the sky then directly behind you. Use weights. But light ones so you don't burn up lactic acid.    Thighs, go on a bicycle. And possibly lots of squats. I personally find this the esasilest to get more muscley and I hate mine, but yeah. Even just crouching and then standing up quickly a few times a day may help. Or run really quickly up and down stairs in many shorts bursts of energy.    For your tummy, muscle will be created by situps - possibly the best way to get close to abs. However, you will not see any muscle tone if you still have a layer of fat over your stomache. Fat can be gotten rid of just by cardio. Like running, swimming &c...    Your best bet is to do those 3 excersises lightly, LIGHTLY and do a bit of cardio.    Hope this helps you!    x|`|o5ms0Gifaa	Targetted weight reduction is quite difficult, some peeple would declare impossible, however the one diet which clearly showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials left, it was highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I worked off 30 pounds, it clearly does produce success!|`|F7Ma8tZpaa	There isn't really any way to target a specific area of your body in regard to weight loss. What you can do is do cardio workouts, such as running, jogging, jump roping, or anything that keeps your heart rate up. That will help you to lose weight.
WKBA4JlFaa	The absolute best way to burn body fat is through cardio. Going on a diet usually results in your body adjusting to the lower intake of food and calories which means the weight usually comes back. Best way to keep it off is to make "Healthier" choices but keep your caloric intake reasonably the same and then ramp up your calories burned a day through cardio.     Weight training is good as well, but for strictly losing body fat, you'll have more luck with cardio.|`|yPst0i9Yaa	If we want to live a healthier life, you need to keep an eye regarding the type of food you eat and what nutrients and minerals you get with your present eating habits. Another health problem which concerns people today is the rampant occurrence of obesity. Morbid obesity is a result of a sedentary lifestyle coupled with very poor eating habits.

TORBP6QIaa	OK...water is good and if you have any suppositories for this problem use one of them.  Your next move is to go sit on the toilet and practice pushing that poop out. If it isnt going to happen just yet go for a walk and try again in 20-30 minutes....the continued muscle action will help reshape the poo hopefully into an easier shape to pass.  If you have some of those disposable rubber gloves you may want to support the skin down there when you push...Its very likely that you will get a few tiny tears from passing this poop...and you will have a little bit of blood...its all normal and will heal within a day or two.|`|Kz6M8NBEaa	This has happen to me before.

Six pack abs are usually developed initially through indirect stimulus. These exercises include squatting, dead lifting, overhead pressing, pull-ups, dynamic rows, and bench press. Six pack abs are the sculpted muscles of the abdominal region. Only a good diet will result in the look you desire. Six pack abs are compacted and the buttocks gathered under to correct the angle of the pelvis.    Six pack abs are obtained in two parts.    First part is diet and it?s best to eat low sugars and many small meals. Six pack abs are in big demand right now. However, in terms of attaining a six pack of abs in relation to building a bigger chest, sculpting your abs takes a little more work, education, and discipline. Six pack abs are heavily commercialized these days through movies and ads, and everyone would like to have one. Hence the search volume on Google is high on these search terms.    The second one is desire and discipline.

It seems as though your body is probably have a reaction to the active ingredient, but it is not uncommon for dietary supplements or replacement therapies to cause disturbances within our body. It would be best though to probably stop taking the pill, in case it is damaging your stomach's mucous/ protective layer.     Sudden changes in our bodies can always cause stress upon them, especially moving from immobility to quite extensive excersise, so continue to take it easy and your body will need MORE rest than it previouslyusly has. It needsrepaireair the muscle and make cellular adjustments on the inside of your body. I suggest see your doctor about the pill and continue to look after your self!

qTeSTy7Saa	When you sleep, your metabolism slows way down. If you don't eat breakfast, your body burns calories at a slow rate, and it takes until 3 pm for your body to realize it needs more calories (food). If you do eat breakfast at 6 am (which is good, you should), your metabolism increases and burns more calories, and since your burning calories at a faster rate, it only takes until 10:30 am for your body to realize it needs more calories. eating breakfast helps burn more fat throughout the day.|`|Gq0t3ERIaa	Eating stimulates your metabolism, "speeding" it up...  You getting hungry at 10:30am, I don't know. Do you an ulcer or gastritis?

Sometimes it's the best conversation available.|`|rpV0ZXMxaa	People on yahoo cannot diagnose you correctly and may do more harm to you than going to the doctor. You should call a centre that specializes in mental health and ask them what your options are. I am positive that there are options out there for people who cannot afford to be assessed. This is MY opinion only but you should do some research on bipolar or depression and schizophrenia. Could have a dual diagnosis. Good luck :)|`|mM55vgZHaa	No, Bipolar diesease can be linked to extreme mood swings and be classified in  a mania or depression state.

xKYXurpNaa	Fresh fruit all the way.    Any kind of fruit diet is really idiotic but if you want to do so, eat real fruit.    Fruit has fiber and vitamins and minerals while juice is either fortified or stripped and added with HFCS or High Fructose Corn Syrup which is terrible for you.    With any luck, on a fruit juice diet, the excess sugar will cause your intestines to become overgrown with yeast and you will get a candida infection (don't believe me, google it).    Don't be lazy, eat properly and exercise.|`|MYqu4bDNaa	IF U COMPARE ANY JUICE WITH ITS FULL FRUIT STUFF,DEFINETELY THE LATER IS PREFERABLE ,AS IT CONTAINS FIBRE WHICH ALSO HELPS IN GOOD BOWEL MOVEMENTS AND AVOIDS CONSTIPATION.YOU KNOW THAT CONSTIPATION ALSO IS A FACTOR IN WEIGHT GAIN,SO INDIRECTLY FIBRE  HELPS IN LOSING WEIGHT.

But be careful not to get over-weight.|`|X9QOHRLFaa	hi, well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.    www.xattack.in|`|mHHy7Foraa	wOW. i WISH i WAS THAT LIGHT. oNLY 2 KG TO GO :)|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	You should add calories slowly into your daily intake, but don't just sit around and eat.

QBUypAmAaa	5 inches to 6 is normal, all around the world this is the average range.  4.5 inches is a little less than normal, but still good enough.  Less than 4 inches is a bit of something to worry about.  6.5 inches is a bit above average.  7 inches is borderlining well endowed really.  Above that, well you're pretty blessed.    A lot of guys make the number higher, which I'm not sure why because most of them aren't 7 inches or above, the percent of guys who do have penises 7 inches and above are about 10 to 15 percent of all men, so most guys really fall in the average range of 5 to 6 inches like I said which is about 70 percent of all men.|`|nQW1MSMpaa	5-7 inches is average.|`|cngrEZRHaa	Thats on the big side.

AnW3dzQfaa	One of the things that helped me was to quit doing the things that made me want a cigarette.  For me, I stopped drinking wine at night, chewed gum in the morning on the way to work or ate hard candy.  I realized if I just go out of my everyday routines then it made it so much easier not to smoke.  I was like clock work on when I would smoke so I would do different things during those times to get my mind off of smoking.  The hardest for me was not smoking before I went to bed at night but I did it.  Good luck!

nx8lxAJdaa	The first question you need to ask is if you masturbated. If you did do it a lot, redness and soreness is common. Also this is the reason for the bump. When you ejaculate and don't clean up, it will leave white bumps where you spilled your load.
zSm2S6eTaa	Running, sprinting, weight lifting, but most importantly diet. Eat more lean meats and green vegetables. Less junk food and not too much fruit (alot of sugar especially when your trying to lose weight at your size). Burning calories is the only way to shed body fat, once you start getting skinnier, you will notice your hungry alot more. Try to find the ideal weight you can keep.     My ideal bodyfat is around 9-10% but, I like to stay around 7-8%. I end up pigging out sometimes, because I can't help it! But, I kinda like the torture of staying thinner. :D|`|kuxVB76maa	about 10|`|xzhJ0lWfaa	go to a ideologistt would be better for u...so u cannot do mistake with your wellness|`|AA11739944	Not much at all.

AA10297143	By not drinking coke, this will not on its own cause your teeth to become whiter.  You will still need to do something such as brush well, go see a dentist to have stains removed, or use a whitener strip such as Crest or Rembrandt, or some other brand.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Probably not but you will have less cavities.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	Yes!

Congratulations on kickin the habit!|`|1GAcfgS3aa	4-5 cans per day?!? If you stop or cut back, not only will your teeth get whiter, you will be healthier too. Coke is full of empty calories and makes you fat. But beside that, your teeth will start to get whiter if you stop drinking so much.    If you want to speed up the process, try this teeth whitening kit called Movie Star Look. I've been using it for about a month and my teeth are about 5 shades whiter than when I started. I found this link where you can try it out for free:    http://32whiteteeth.com/Free-Whitening-K...    Best of luck to you.
Q8L7NWjwaa	There are corrective surgeries that could repair this issue for you.  If it is a physical nuisance enough~consider speaking to your parents about it and see if they'd be willing to take you for a consult with a plastic surgeon.  If it's not unbearable or maybe your not comfortable speaking to your parents... you could wait until your 18 and seek out the corrective measures for it then.  It's not something noticeable by others not like a facial mole or anything like that~so if you can wait till your of age to take care of on your own~try not to think about or dwell on it.|`|MhpccWpmaa	i have the same problem and i sympathize with you. first i have to correvt your guy friend because having larger inner labias is not having a "saggy vagina". some guys love longer ones. i've gotten over the fact that i have them but if you can't there is always surgery when you're old enough. you can have a plastic surgeon correct the problem|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Every single woman is different. It's normal. There's nothing you can really do until you are of age to get it operated on. You can get surgery down there if you are THAT uncomfortable with it. But you probably do have to be 18+ (or maybe the age limit is older in other states) until then - you will just have to accept it.    Once you are older and you are sexually active - the boys probably won't even notice what it looks like. Their mind would ONLY be focused on just getting sexual.|`|e17ZrhZFaa	There is nothing you can do. It is the way it is. There are no excercises or diets for that. The only thing would be to get plastic surgery. That is expensive, and doctor is going to do it to a teenager. You need to stop worrying about it... and I hate to say it... you need to accept that you can't change it.|`|e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	You should discuss this with your mother. This used to be a problem that was rarely discussed but now more women are coming out regarding their longer vaginal labia. There is a surgery to fix it and if your doctor feels that this is a life altering or painful experience for you, he may petition your insurance company to get them shortened for you.     Look on line at bettydodson.com, it does show different women and their vulva. I am not telling you this for acceptance reasons, just so you can see how different we all are.     I hope that you are really wanting to do something about this because of the way you feel and not what your boyfriend said. Believe me, when you get older, the things that guys go "ewww" about now will be all the rage with them later.  If you are in pain, get it checked out and see if surgery is an option for you. I have never heard the term saggy vagina, is your boyfriend nuts. I dont think he has seen one. He is at an age where he can not even appreciate a vagina for what it really is.|`|sowS7KW2aa	no need a surgery , just find a nice panty or pads to hold it|`|UCXCkooWaa	Im sorry, but theres nothing you can do about that.

ikzqudHTaa	I recommend an IUD. IUD's are not good for women who have multiple partners, because IUD's mixed with STD's causes terrible pelvic infections. Since you have only one partner, you wouldn't be at risk for this. Also, an IUD doesn't require you to take pills on a daily basis, so when you don't plan on having sex for a while you don't have to worry about remembering to keep taking a pill.|`|7BIez3f3aa	Perhaps not the best answer but an option.

This is just an unfortunate myth that keeps being repeated.     Doctors recommend strength training for those younger than you.  It improves athletic performance and helps prevent injury.     Various medical websites have articles on this.  For example, see the following statement linked from the Cleveland Clinic:     Despite the previously held belief that strength training was unsafe and ineffective for children, health organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) now "support children's participation in appropriately designed and competently supervised strength training programs."    http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/stre...

However, I encourage you to also strengthen your legs and back. If you exercise all the major muscles in your body, this will lead to the best appearance and the most strength.  Real strength = Overall strength|`|OgQG7oNOaa	I heard coffee will stunt your growth.|`|6sAddKd6aa	just dont bench press, i think that stunts ur growth...but pushups and pull ups are the best way to go|`|CYJhluVuaa	You're good to go.

I have never heard of that, i dont think it's true.|`|CRj45BFQaa	Running, push-ups, crunches, planks, etc. are all great exercises that definitely won't stunt your growth. If you are young do not use heavy weights because there is a chance they will stunt your growth. I hope I helped!
r7gxrbqGaa	103 actually sounds like a healthy weight for any girl to me. but you didnt put in your age or height which i would need to really judge it.   but since you asked how to lose weight.don't do what most girls do and try to eat less. that is supposed to make your metabolism slow down. Instead just eat healthy, and if you get a chance to have something really unhealthy like most desserts and fast food just deny it and have something healthy, it just takes some self control. and of course you can be creative with healthy foods, you don't have to eat plain lettuce or something like that lol.   And if you can, run a mile or two every day or at least 3 days a week, you could use a treadmill or just run down your street.    good luck to ya|`|CYLFIdhLaa	Im not sure how tall you are but at 103 lbs you sound like you are under weight....dont worry about losing anything or you will look sickly|`|AA11739944	You have a mental problem.

Maybe in around 2 or 3 months it will be gone depending how much work you do , do not do crash diets because the weight always comes back . Also you might want to get a trainer since its everyones health is the most important investment a person can make , who cares how much it cost's the point is being healthy and not ever needing to do a diet again and staying fit .|`|74vbT0doaa	Optifast.

Sprinting, adding hills or an incline can increase amount of calories burned.    Train your abs 2 or 3 days a week. Not everyday like everybody thinks. That's not good. You wont see any progress. Just like your biceps, chest, or triceps your abs need time to rest and recover. Make sure when you do ab exercises you do them slowly with good form and flex your abs and really try to focus on using your abs.     Here are alot of good ab exercises: http://www.shapefit.com/abs-exercises-sc...|`|xOnaiGozaa	crunches of course, but the one that we do in practice that seems to do the most is to lay down flat on your back and then keep your heels off the ground (legs straight & extended) for a while. maybe start at 45 seconds and every week add like 5 seconds. they hurt but it really is worth it. promise.|`|ZR25pTOYaa	jog, push ups, pull ups, and petal pushers, 30 minutes each a day.|`|UuFqVGPRaa	You have abs. It's normal and healthy to have that thin layer of fat, but if you want to show off your abs try eating 0 carbs and sugar. You don't really need equipment but it would be helpfull to have a pull up bar. Try doing lots of sit-ups, crunches, flutter kicks, mountain climbers, and RUN... run run run. burn all that fat off . run a longer distance and a slower pace. If i was you i would eat lots of greens and fiber.
tEpPgjSFaa	At your height and weight, you are in the Healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) Category, and you do not need to worry about losing any weight. However, you can safely lose five pounds according to BMI charts.     When your goal is a smaller weight loss goal, it is harder to lose the weight. I am in the process of losing close to 60 pounds and it has taken me three weeks to lose just over six pounds. It is possible to lose five pounds in a week, but do not expect those results.    The best food to eat will help sustain you and ward off feelings of hunger. These foods include whole grains, lean protein, fresh or frozen fruit and vegetables, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products. You should have at least two servings of lean protein and dairy products, five servings of fruit and vegetables, and make sure that you choose whole grain options whenever possible. Use multigrain bread instead of white, brown rice instead of white rice, and so-on. Try to limit your intake of artificial sugar and alcoholic beverages (although, at 14, you should eliminate alcohol completely). I try to give myself some kind of sweet treat, such as a 100 calorie dessert pack or a drink at Starbucks, each day to reward myself for eating healthily. The daily treats are something to look forward to, and as long as I eat the treats in moderation, they are perfectly okay.    Remember that you do not need to deny yourself anything. If you and your friends are going out for Pizza, just limit yourself to one slice. Suggest a thinner crust pizza, or get some vegetables on your slice. If you go for fast food, you can get the burger and fries. Try ordering a kids meal sized portions and getting extra vegetables on your burger. Try to avoid mayonnaise though. That adds a lot of fat and calories. The main thing is to keep portions small and make some sacrifices. For example, if you are at McDonalds and you get the salad with fat-free dressing, or a kids meal burger with apple dippers you can treat yourself to dessert, such as a fruit and yogurt parfait or the reduced fat vanilla ice cream cone. However, if you get the burger and fries, you should avoid the dessert since the meal itself is a higher calorie meal.     Just remember to eat sensible portions and focus on the foods I've suggested. With this, you will feel healthier and hopefully lose the weight. Also, remember to work on some strength training-even simple lunges, pushups, crunches/situps, and using canned goods to preform certain exercises (such as biceps curls, etc.) This will help build lean muscle which will keep your metabolism up and help you burn fat and become leaner and healthier.

ICu6qT1Zaa	You won't be able to build muscle without an excess of calories and protein so losing weight shouldn't be an issue. The extra exercise will consume a few extra calories so you may need to up your intake a little bit. Body builders always complain they can't put on muscle without putting on fat.    Don't bother with protein drinks THEY DO NOT WORK. If you eat a normal diet you will already probably be consuming excess protein, any more will just end up being excreted.     The best exercises with weights are deadlifts, cleans, snatches and squat jumps - anything involving a quick and powerful all-body action. I don't know about any football specific exercises.|`|H08OfVsbaa	Here's a good website that will your answers.  http://www.elinorerigby.com/BuildingMusc...|`|XWEiuTTRaa	don't do much cardio- as cardio burns the fat..|`|Gpc9WHFyaa	Click on the link I posted as a source.

Whatever you do - just relax! - I know that is easier said than done.  I learned that my shortness of breath is not because I can't get enough breath in, but rather, I am not letting enough breath out.  This could also be related to hormonal changes - alot is going on when you are 14.  You may want to have your mom take you to the doctor just to give you some peace of mind.

So i compiled a list of a whole bunch of excersizes off the internet.  I started doing them and in about 4 days i grew 0.25 and inch. Thats impressive.

Get your rest. Every hour before midnight is worth two after wards. Go to bed early.   Things to eat for growth and repair are rich in vitamins (spinach, green beans and veg) Be sure to eat fruits and drink fruit juice and water. This clears toxins and the yuckies from your body that stop you from growing.        Stay away from things that over tax your body or organs (alcohol, vinegar, sugar, soda, coffee)    If your body is trying to hard to repair, and to remove toxins it has less energy and time to grow with.    Stay limber. Exercise and stretch daily while drinking plenty of fluids.

FSkge0d1aa	1) Creatine, much like testosterone or estrogen, is a hormone that is naturally created by your body. If you do not cycle it and take it with care, your body will quit producing it, and not just that, your body will begin to produce hormones to counter-balence the harm you are doing it. If you do take it, cycle it, you will be sorry when your thirty and cant figure out why your muscles deteriorated so fast.    2) Creatine, much like alcohol, is a substance that your kidneys are responsible for filtering out of your blood stream. If you chose to continuously repeat putting creatine in your body for years - you will see the effects that this has on your kidneys when you are begging for a doner.    3) Creatine, much like many new drugs, has not been FDA approved. In fact, they are considering banning it from stores - or at least making the buying age 18 for it. The effects that taking the substance has on aging is undeterminable. Nobody knows if it will promote cancers, diseases, or other major health concerns.    If you are taking them, and you are not cycling them, at least take this little piece of advice from my whole answers...  Drink lots of water - that is the best chance you will have.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	Honestly don't know, I'd try it, and see if if performs any better than plain old bog standard cheap Creatine Monohydrate..

Also broth based soups, fiber rich foods (keep you full) and at least 10 glasses of water a day, take a multivitamin to keep your body nourished.

When you are on a diet with such a low calorie count you need to eat frequently and you cannot save 800 calories for dinner.  You need to drink a lot of water throughout the day.  All of your meals need to involve lots of vegetables, healthy proteins, and some healthy fats such as olive oil and nuts.    Things like lettuce and no fat popcorn are good snacks because they have so few calories.      I would reccomend that you at least take a trip to a bookstore and look at a "Zone" diet book, to get more ideas of the foods you should be eating.  There is a way to make the 1200 calories go a very long way, and not be hungry at all.
AA10436595	No, it's not normal to have severe pain anywhere.  Pain is nature's way of getting your attention that something is wrong.  You need to tell your doctor about this and let him/her find out what's going on.|`|smFfcmYuaa	Chest pain can have many causes so it's perhaps semi-normal but there are a lot of acute and chronic conditions it's a symptom of.     The most likely ones are heartburn/acid reflux/indigestion/whatever and muscle fatigue or an impact injury. Sometimes you can just move in particular way without realizing it and get a pain in your chest that hurts really bad yet goes away eventually. If this pain comes with a shortness of breath then asthma would be a likely culprit (although of asthma of course is constricting of the throat) or possibly lung cancer or emphysema especially if you smoke and drink or have been around a lot of toxic chemicals. Since it's been a few years it's not as likely that you have a broken or cracked rib but it is possible that you have an improperly healed break. A really unlikely scenario is that some kind of debris is wedged beneath your skin but if this was a piece of metal then it likely would have been detected in a metal detector by now and the pain also would more likely be constant.     Also it could be a cardiovascular problem, anything from clotting to bleeding to tearing to having too many or too few arteries. Those are not likely for you but if nothing else becomes apparent it's worth checking out.    And don't forget that this could be some sort of allergy. It's rare for allergies to manifest as pain in one particular area but it can happen. And perhaps it bothers you in other areas and you haven't realized it for some reason.    Consequently you could get most of these diagnosed at a regular physician's office if they have an x-ray machine so that would be your best bet. Take heart that if the pain is random and infrequent it is likely either trivial or terminal. In either case you wouldn't have much to worry about for long.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Pleurisy?

f8sUtNVGaa	Menopause isn't the sudden stopping of your periods.  For most women, it's a gradual happening called "perimenopause" http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/perimen... then "menopause" is defined as having gone a year without periods.    Some women in perimenopause don't reven realize what's happening.  It often starts happening in the 40's.  Periods will get longer or shorter, or heavier or lighter, or more/less often, as hormones start declining.    Perimenopause can be triggered by running out of usable eggs in your ovaries.  Before a baby girl is born, she can have millions of eggs in her ovaries.  At birth, she may have 400,000-500,000 eggs.  Most of these die; some are ovulated (released from the ovaries).  So it can be true that later menarche (first period) can result in later menopause.    My own perimenopause started at age 38, and now at 47 I'm in true menopause.|`|ndmydIkIaa	My MD says the average age is 52.

By the sounds of it, you're doing very well =) it's better than I'm doing ^_^ keep at it!

If you're exercising that much and eating that little, you may be slowing down your metabolism, which in turn could decrease your weight loss.  For women, you should eat at least 1200 calories a day (I don't know the number for men).  For more information on how many calories your body needs, I'd check out this website: http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie...  Or I've found a lot of helpful information on www.selfdietclub.com

So.....just stretch your bicep and you'll be back to normal.|`|15kqWWNQaa	Yes it is normal.    Stretching after exercise helps you keep flexibility and helps work the lactic acid out.

f8sUtNVGaa	This product is intended to cleanse the gastrointestinal tract.    THC is stored in fat cells, not in the gastrointestinal tract.    I have been watching students be drug-tested for many years.  There is no single method that is guaranteed to help someone pass a urine-drug-screen if the person has been smoking marijuana.  I have seen students drink cranberry juice, lemon juice, vinegar, and huge amounts of water and still fail.  I have seen students do nothing and pass (when they shouldn't have).  There are simply too many factors involved for one method to work for everyone.    I realize this isn't the Answer you wanted, but it's an honest one, and it's one based on 20+ years of observation.|`|cEaODF8Raa	not much can help you with thc, it is stored in your fat cells. it can stay with you for up to 3 months. I found out the hard way, i lost my job after testing positive for pot. smoked a couple of hits on new years eve, tested in february and failed.  you might be able to pull it off by doing a week of fat burning cardio workouts and then stop exercising and start eating alot for a few days that will put you in a fat storing phase.it depends on how much time you have before the test. good luck.

You work out as well, so if anything your exercising and activity load in athletics will possibly tone you up and trim you down a few pounds.

Best wishes|`|TjPwxbuJaa	I have sleep apnea as well, and like you, I am not overweight. I've been treated with it for nearly 10 years (while in my mid-20s)  My CPAP therapy did wonders for me, and mine too is set to '8'. It sounds to me like your pressure might not be high enough. The therapy may have reduced the number of episodes, but not eliminated them. You shouldn't be falling asleep during the day if you've had 7 hours of sleep. I think it would be best to make an appointment with your ENT specialist and see if you can't raise the pressure on your CPAP and avoid the miserable sleep study.|`|ON84EQaBaa	I also have sleep ab, it took years before I found out what was wrong,never slept, like you I would nod off for a few min. at a time never real sleep. Once on the c-pap I saw a big change but not enough, I had to go from a pressure of 10 to 14. I now can get 5-6 hours of sleep wich is a blessing to me. Maybe if your doctor change your pressure it will help|`|y4XOe4kUaa	This oughta scare you, I was driving an 18 wheeler cross country for a living. I would go to sleep and miss entire portions of the drive, I would just suddenly realize that I had no recollection of the past fifteen or twenty minutes of the drive. Turns out, they call it micro-napping and it comes from being flat out exhausted.    I recently went for a new sleep study. They call it a "titration". Basically it's to see if your pressures are working. Like you I was tired all the time. One of the things that they discovered was that in my sleep I would turn over on my left side and my mask would pull away from my face. The machine would speed up briefly, and unable to compensate for the leak, it would drop down to half of my normal pressure. I had no idea it was happening, so basically I was spending a part of the night without using my CPAP. I'd wake up feeling horrible. You might need a new study and you might need a different style or size mask. Best to ask your doctor about it.

However, by going far less than 1200 calories, it's almost guarenteed you will deficient in vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.  500 calories a day isn't enough to provide all your fiber, vitamins, carbs, and essential fat every day.

Just like someone who overreats would be unhealthy. You're not getting proper vitamins and minerals for growth and so you'll probably get all those bone and brain **** ups old people get at a relatively young age. Also, if you're eating only that many calories you will not be able to build much muscle at all, hence your "skinny fatness". In some cases you could lose hair and you just generally look like overall crap - tired, ashy, bony. I mean it's your choice, but I know a woman who did that when she was younger.

If it persists, and its really weighing you down, go to your normal doctor and see if they'll prescribe an anti-depressant. Does it run in your family?  Do you have anxiety? You may have an imbalance.  Stay away from the drugs though. Trust me. Temporary fix, long-term side effects.|`|VYqVi5fhaa	There is always some underlying reason why you feel sad.  Right now you are looking for a quick fix, as you already know, by drinking and drugging.  this is only going to prolong the inevitable, which is resolving what is really bothering you.  Just by reading your paragraph, I already know that your trying to deny your hurt feelings with the boyfriend.  When someone "dumps" you its never about you but something that they are searching for within themselves.  I would suggest reading some self-help books on self-esteem.  The universe is trying to teach you to love yourself no matter what happens on the outside, no matter what other people say or do.  It doesn't feel it right now but if you can come out on the other side without resorting to drinking and drugs there won't be anything you cannot overcome.  I am an ordained minister and have been counseling for many years.  You are welcome to email me but Please do not use the route of escape.  It only worsens as you get older.  Nip these issues in the bud now while you are young. Its okay to feel hurt and admit someone hurt your feelings and that's pretty crappy.  Once you admit it, cry about, and let it out is only when you rise above that issue.  My suggestion is feel the pain and remember what Shakespeare said "Better to have Loved and Lost, than to have never Loved at all."  Remember you always have a friend here to talk to.
yOwRD4ZEaa	What sort of capsule is it? Some of them are extended release which means that you need to swallow them whole or you'll get too much of the medication at once. Capsules that are not extended release can be opened up and their contents can be poured into some applesauce or something similar.     If you aren't sure after reading the information that came with it, call up the pharmacy and ask. You can also call your doctor and find out if there's an alternative medication that comes in a chewable or liquid form.     As for swallowing pills, I just put them in my mouth, tilt my head back and chug a bunch of water. The pill just goes down with it. I know other people that have an easier time taking them with food. Take a bite of crackers or something and chew it up really well. Then put the pill in your mouth and position it into the chewed food with your tongue. Swallow the food as normal.    If the doctor said you could break it open, go ahead and do so. Just open it and sprinkle the contents onto some yogurt or applesauce and eat it.|`|AA11739944	don't chew pills dummy.  drink water with it.

It depends on how much you workout during the day, how fast your metabolism is, and how much other food you eat. Most likely it could cause you to gain a lot of weight.

sHdsIUyWaa	I would go get it checked out. Just this past 2 weeks, Ive had a constant horrible headache. I just figured that since its cold outside, its made my migraines worse. I finally went to see the Dr on Monday. She immediately admitted me to the hospital. I got a MRI and a spinal tap. I had/have very high pressure in my brain and the MRI showed a "mass" that is causing the pressure. I will be transferred to a different hospital as soon as this ice storm and everything clears. Will be having a biopsy at the other hospital. Im not saying this to scare you but I do think its a good idea to get checked. It could be several things though, stress, allergies, sinus pressure. Just get checked out to make sure everything is alright. Keep us updated|`|AA12380217	Red flag: you normally don't get headaches, but now you've had one for 8 days.

She finally heard about a doctor in a neighboring town. He did an extensive health history & uncovered an old car accident that she had been involved in back in high school. After 3 treatments for a misaligned "Atlas bone" by a specialist, she has been migraine free for over a year. If you have ever suffered a head/neck injury, it might be worth checking out.|`|cN6AMupIaa	you need to see a doc asap. could need a scan to tell what is going on so get to it now.|`|5e8c0a244a44c19fb7e5f8cfe26623aaaa	You might be having a reaction to something your eating. my aunt used to have the same problem but then she stopped eating gluten and she hasn't had a migraine since

b81H0vlYaa	You are a healthy weight for your height.  Just be careful not to gain any, because you are on the higher end of the spectrum.  Kudos though on having the two kids and still being a good weight.      Use this site.  I like it because it lets you figure in your waist size and gives you an pretty accurate assessment of you weight and health.  It also tells you how many calories a day you should eat to maintain your weight and an estimate of your total body fat.    http://home.fuse.net/clymer/bmi/    Use this site to see what weights are healthy for your age http://www.healthdiscovery.net/links/cal...    All of these sites are just based on a normal person, so if you have big bones or are very muscular you need to keep that in consideration.  Don't forget to eat healthy and get some type of excersice (two kids should be enough! ha) to keep your body and not just your weight healthy.|`|Eo4P2s3yaa	You should weigh 158 pounds.     However, for each additional kid, you will need to add 50 pounds.|`|AlJ557gHaa	your at a good weight|`|AJEuBK1Laa	Your fine! but that should be up to you|`|h5wRTuplaa	your Body Mass Index is 24 which is in the normal bracket - which i think is good considering you ave had 2 children :)|`|lxJoXNZwaa	According to the chart below that's healthy/normal:    http://www.healthchecksystems.com/height...
dcd11iUwaa	haha  you can live perfectly well on one kidney|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	yes they can, tho the urine is often brown or very dark dark yellow because the kidneys aren't filtering the toxins.  That is what dialysis does for them.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Some dialysis patients do urinate, however they dont clear the waste products out of body like healthy kidneys so the person still needs dialysis.|`|KBCFVZVNaa	I heard that peoples can die if both of their kidney fails|`|JBcpBn5Gaa	When I was 8 years old my kidneys failed.    BACKGROUND: I also had strep throat and a staph infection during this time.   - I had been peeing blood for weeks and throwing up like crazy for a month. I just didnt tell my parents I was peeing blood because I was embarrased.   (The only reason they found out was because I forgot to flush the toilet)    So I was able to pee, but the doctor said one more week without finding out I would have died.|`|4Kh3egZuaa	It depends. People are born with kidneys. How many of your kidneys is good. If you have one kidney good, its okay.|`|OS8TRe0Uaa	you can die if you kidneys stop working|`|hrjRq0Sjaa	no, you stop peeing forever.|`|C1d7VL5xaa	well you have two kidney so if one dies yes...but  if tbey both die..you kind of die soo no|`|BF4C5sbtaa	Just so you know..    If two of your kidneys fail....you die  You can live with one kidney...soo....YES you can pee.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	If your kidney fails I wouldn't worry about peeing.  You will die without a functioning kidney.  It is possible to live with only one kidney or to get a kidney transplant but that is probably something you should see a doctor about and worry about now rather than waiting until you can no longer pee.|`|vVTmJjJDaa	usually, at first, they can - however, after several years on dialysis, many are unable to - at which time, dialysis is then increased to take care of it.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	yes, but not as much, my brother has a failed kidney and has dialysis 3 times a week.|`|AA10234018	Sometimes. The ability to filter is almost always tied to the ability to make urine, but not always.  Most people who start dialysis still have some, though little, kidney function. It's just not enough to sustain life. But it's enough that they are still making urine. When the body realizes that something is doing its job (the dialysis cleaning the body), it stops doing what little it has been. So, once people start dialysis, they slowly lose what remaining function they have.  After about 1-2 years, nearly all dialysis patients produce little to no urine (a few tablespoons per day at most).|`|Ds7KKswNaa	You will die if your kidney fails-it filters all of the toxins out of your body|`|gpBicBEPaa	youll find out soon enough|`|1Sl45kHMaa	Actually if your Kidney fails, I believe you will not be able to o anything. Your whole body stops.|`|U3Egv0y8aa	yea you can,but your on a whole bunch of pills. if both of your kidneys fails you may need to find someone that will gave you one if their a match.|`|qbW4z3Uuaa	You actually have two kidneys. Your kidneys are what filter out toxins and then dump that into your bladder. Your bladder is what actually "Holds" your pee. So if you lost your bladder you would technically be unable to properly excrete urine without some type of medical aid. If one or both your kidneys fail your body will no longer be able to properly filter the toxins out of your body. These toxins, if you do not seek out immediate medical attention, will eventually kill you because it will slowly poison you and at the same time you will not properly get the nutrients from the things that you digest either. When you are in the hospital and are typically bed ridden, they will insert a catheder(sp) This is a tube that they place through your urethra and into your bladder so that way you do not have to go to the bathroom to void your bladder and it usually goes into a bag near your bed. This does not mean "you are no longer able to go pee" its just so that you dont have to get up if you are unable to.
UOZP4Ma5aa	You need to wear them as often as possible, 20 hours
oCTMqI4haa	yes, it's the same thing.   Your brackets are "glued" to your teeth, and then they put wires/bands on them. the wires & bands get change monthly ( depending on your dentist ). brackets are part of the braces.    so yes, they are the same thing. pretty much :)
mHHy7Foraa	Don't bother with those stupid weight loss pills and stuff, they don't work.   (Believe me, I've tried)    Cardio. I repeat, CARDIO!!    energetic excercises that get your heart rate going will burn fat without increasing muscle.    Weights will not burn fat, only increase muscle mass.I reccommend swimming. It's very low impact so doesn't hurt to exercise, yet is very very very cardiovascular. Look at any full time swimmer. They are all very lean with hardly any fat on them. If not, running? Elliptical is good.    Even running up and down stairs can burn a few hundred calories in half an hour.    Remember, a pound of fat is equal to 3,500 calories, and in a normal day you burn off the equivalent of (your weight in lbs) X 10.    So she will burn off about 1360cals a day from basically just living. So if she wanted to lose 1 pound a day, hypothetically, she would need to not consume any calories and burn off 3500-1360 cals through excercise. Obviously this is pretty much impossible, but hopefully you get the gist :)    Anyway, wish her good luck and I hope she does well! x|`|e22c69d9c930e30e0d8bcfc48f81dd6faa	Firstly, I don't know what is a healthy weight for a girl of her age and height. It is perhaps worth researching that first because despite what you may think you're seeing, she may be a healthy weight.    Anyway, that said...    For any diet to work in the long-term, it can't be something that you do for three months and then hope it'll magically last forever - it requires a life-style change.    That's why you find so many people constantly on diets - they do something drastically for a few months, lose weight, get lazy, gain weight, diet again...    Exercising once or twice a week, not eating as much junk food and eating healthily.....for good....is the only way of acheiving this.

Well u also need to squeeze that to have an orgasm + ejaculate. so what you want to do is masterbate as normal but dont squeeze that muscle (this takes a decent amount of self controll and you proberly wont do it the first time round) Just keep masterbating with out squeezing that muscle and been completely relaxed. it wont feel like anything is happening but everything is still brewing up and that sorta stuff after you have done it for atleast 20mins i prefer 30mins which is very boring but its worth it. squeeze the muscle and just carry on masterbating you will have a mind blowing orgasm and shoot A LOT. (This is extremely boring and can get very messy so have a towel and the first few times i did this i got a pain for about 3 seconds after i ejaculated but dont let that put you off it will go away after u have done it a few times)      EDIT: dont do the stop and go techniqe unless you have alot of self controll (since you can feel the orgasm coming so makes it harder to stop) This is pritty much the stop and go just a hell of alot easier and better pleasure|`|AA10475412	Do not masturbate for a few days, and you may ejaculate more.|`|Q0vx8I8raa	dont jerk off for a long period of time... wait like a week if u can
tBF9VfPqaa	Sometimes the braces have traces of nickel, and that is one of the most common allergies with braces. It could quite possibly be from either the braces or the wires.    I would brush in circular motions like a massage on your gum tissue. Even brushing with straight Listerine helps with that as well. (And then rinsing with warm salt water).    You may need some more Vitamin C in your diet as well, depending on what your eating habits are.     I would have your doctor give you whats called an MSDS sheet that has what metals are used for the brackets, and you can take it to your general physician and they can do an allergy test.    If it is for sure an allergy and not from poor diet/lack of good oral hygiene.... then your gums will get better when your braces come off.   Hopefully this helps.    Good luck to you!!!|`|bTXDb5YIaa	i don't know the orthodonist stuff but i think you have allergic reastion to braces or you have the gum disease known as GINGIVITIS

xyWe7BFqaa	Size actually does not matter that much because of the female anatomy and how it relates to sexual pleasure. Most of the sensation women experience during sex is from the nerve endings in their clitoris, which is stimulated by your pubic bone when you thrust. The vagina itself isn't actually where most of the good feelings come from, but some sensation does occur there. It is important to realize that there are only a significant number of nerve endings in the outer third of the vagina, so there is little difference between a 4.5 inch penis and a 7 inch penis.    The above answer assumes that you are having sex with women. If you are having sex with men, a similar principle applies. Stimulation of the prostate gland is what produces pleasure during anal sex, and this gland isn't located very far inside the body. If your penis is as long as your index finger, you will have no problem adequately stimulating the prostate.
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	The vagina will naturally produce lubrication when you are aroused. It shouldn't result in loss of sensation though. If you are concerned see your GP.    It is unlikely to be an infection if you only experience this discharge during sex/when you are aroused. Normal discharge is either white or clear in colour. If your discharge has an offensive smell and/or stains then this could be an indication of infection. Your Dr will need to take a swab and provide treatment accordingly.|`|6YZJZ5aPaa	Try getting in a different position that makes it feel..."tighter" lol on the side - spooning works!
MS5OBY9Waa	All kinds of things could be causing you to miss your period:  stress, poor diet, strenuous exercise, cysts.  Sometimes you may just miss a period with no definite reason.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|RPpXarDDaa	make a workout routine you can stick with. lifting will make you bulky but try cardio or yoga. yoga contributes to making the body look more lean. as well as palates.|`|8ahGYP2Zaa	I know exactly how you feel.

Proper eating habits combined with weight lifting will cause your metabolism to skyrocket.|`|Q59mF95vaa	It can be genetic, or you can work to get one. Usually, people who are physically active throughout the day tend to have a high metabolism because they're expending more calories, and therefore need to eat more to compensate. So, just do more strength training and cardio.    You can also boost your metabolism by choosing the time of day when you exercise. Most researchers believe that doing it in the morning will help keep it up for the rest of the day. Don't exercise right before you go to bed.|`|ooJ3JMDwaa	drink lemon juice   it boosts ur metabolism!|`|RZZGplK8aa	Most people are born with it.

What you should do however, to improve your workout and burn as many calories as possible, it : a)find a hilly area where there are inclines to walk up and down  b)use arm weights- 5 lbs per arm is good  c) walk like you are not in a mall, but in the airport in a hurry!  d) most important- keep your arms at a 90 degree angle(elbows bent) and when you bring one arm forward, cross it over your body to the opposite side (not too much so that you are twisting, just across the body with a fist) then bring it back slightly behind you still keeping the bent elbow. this will increase your calorie burn rather than just walking normally. if you dont do any of these things, you are probably not burning much fat or calories.

I guess that is my way of saying, that I research just about everything just to be on the safe side.  Doctors, for example, are notorious in their lack of knowlege in so many areas, it makes me question just about anything they say at "face value" i.e. trust.    To directly answer your question, almost any vitamin, TAKEN IN MODERATION is highly unlikely to cause you any harm.  Same goes with the fiber - will probably do you more good than if you did not take them.    Do your homework.  You will become smarter (more knowledgeable) and that is always a good thing.    Best of luck with the diet - just keep that in perspective also
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).  The time needed depends on your persistence, but not less than 8-10 weeks.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	you can lose 20 pound in 8 weeks if you stick to this plan workout normally as you do this is excellent workout . to reduce your calories intake you need to eat 3 main meals complete to help your metabolism burn calories and in between you have to eat small snack like carrots and cucumber and a banana or an apple not more than that and always cut the carrots and the cucumber to slices so you eat it slowly and take a look to this site you will have some information about food contain small amount of calories to help you in the future best of luck and hope you reach your target sooner .http://www.caloriecounting.co.uk/resourc...|`|9hTPsTvFaa	i think you could lose it in 3 or 4 months, i have 65 lbs to lose.. think of how lucky you are to have only 20 to lose! i will def have 20 lbs lost in 3 months- im actually aiming to have lost about 26 lbs by then|`|b75bba675dda73187aeb83430b085b44aa	I'd guess you are on your way to losing weight but its going to take at least 2 weeks before you notice anything.

A BMR is calculating how many calories your body burns sitting at rest, so if you were sleeping 24 hours straight with no bodily exertion.  If you are wondering if a number you looked up on the internet is lower then what your body metabolizes at rest, then possibly.  The numbers calculated are always approximations based on your stats.

7pkxOc6Raa	Not with ten reps. With five reps you can add five pounds (even 10-15 in the first few weeks of training on squats and deadlifts), but adding 5 pounds to your ten rep max is significantly harder. And you won't make these gains every week, or you would gain 5 pounds a week, and there are over 50 weeks in a month...you won't increase your bench by 250 pounds.

So, you'd be doing 30 min. of cardio or Wii Fit and then 10 minutes of ab workouts and streching.    As for your diet-   -Try fat-free milk instead of 2%  -Try the granola bar or a trail mix for your snack in school (don't eat everything you listed there at once)  - You're lunch sounds good, you could also try a salad with sliced chicken instead.  So, there are some ideas and good luck with your diet!|`|dLce1JlQaa	definatley jogging AND wii fit would be better than just wii fit or just jogging. the wii fit can help you gain muscle wich burns fat and the jogging can help you lose fat.
ItJzrvQ4aa	Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems,  making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower  recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and  less than ideal hair, teeth, and skin composition. They may have  disruptions in the ability to regulate hormones and protect bone  health, and women could become unable to menstruate.  There are many reasons why people may find it hard to gain weight.  Genetics can obviously play a role, but individual personalities and  the environment can be strong factors.  Some people are just more physically active, they tend to move around  more,  burning more calories than they take in. In children, the inability  to gain weight may signal a condition  known as "failure to thrive," which means a kid is not growing  appropriately for his/her age. This may be caused by an illness, or  eating patterns dictated by a parental idiosyncrasy.   Being able to eat anything with abandon is also deceiving -- even the  skinny need to worry about having too much sugar and fat for good  health. Poor diets can lead to ailments such as heart disease,  stroke, and  cancer.   If you want to put on weight, you should work out, to insure that you  put on muscle and not fat. Healthy weight gain, just like healthy  weight loss, takes time and  requires a conscious effort to apply good habits.  Recommended Ways to Gain Weight  Have meals with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and the  right kinds of fat (such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fats,  olive oil, canola oil, pistachios, almonds and walnuts). Heinemann  suggests the following ratio: 60%-70% carbohydrates, 10%-15% protein,  and a small amount of fat.   Eat foods higher in calories, vitamins, and minerals, as opposed to  higher in fat or sugar.   Pack more nutritious calories in each serving. For example, you may  add grated cooked eggs to mashed potatoes, ground chicken to soups and  gravies, cheese in casseroles, eggs, and soups, and nonfat dried milk  in soups, shakes, milk, and mashed potatoes.   If you get too full too fast, try having more high-calorie foods or  slices of foods as opposed to consuming the whole thing (raisins  versus grapes, granola and Grape Nuts versus corn flakes, mango slices  versus the whole mango).   Limit drinking beverages to a half-hour before and after a meal.   Drink mixed juices (apple/berry, peach/orange/banana as opposed to  one juice beverages) for a higher calorie intake.   With moderation, you may add in good fat sources to meals such as  nuts, avocado, olives, and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel).   Snack in between meals. Nuts, dried fruits, and yogurt are good  options, but it's also important to find nutritious foods that you  will enjoy.   Have a nutritious snack before bedtime, such as a peanut butter  sandwich.|`|CYJhluVuaa	If you smoke it increases your metabolism and you will lose weight. Other than that try Whey, or  protein to gain weight quickly.|`|aw9cmcwxaa	dont TRY to gain weight by stuffing your face, because you'll get too used to it and become unhealthy and fat.  just eat a little bit more, not an uncomfortable amount though.   but stay healthy  let yourself grow naturally, your still really short|`|dLce1JlQaa	protein supplements..uhhhmm..carbs|`|q5Gx9XIFaa	well...when i went through my growth spurt, i ate A LOT and i gained some pounds but the growth spurt also gave me a curve in my back and now i have to stay in sports and stuff like that....anyway if you go into a growth spurt anytime soon you will gain wait don't worry!

Working out is the most important thing.|`|8RlYLfy2aa	Thats a pratically impossible goal. The most weight you shouldnt possibly lose in week more than about 5 pounds, and that is still a hard goal. The only weigh to lose that much weight would be to not eat and excerise like crazy. Which is highly not recomended and quite dangerous.|`|HTyp1pFyaa	The best way to lose weight is to reduce your calorie intake. The trouble with doing this that it takes tremendous self-control and proper balance of nutrition. There are a number of good websites out there that can tell you the calorie levels of different foods. Google has a good system that tracks everything for you at http://www.google.com/webmasters/igoogle...    If you want to lose weight, maintain a diet of 800 calories a day. The best way to accomplish this is to eat 6-8 small meals throughout the day. Using the calorie calculators you can easily figure out what foods can be eaten.     The two problems with this method arise from the hunger cravings that will hit and getting all the proper nutrients in just 800 calorie days. If you can learn to ignore the hunger cravings, they should go away in a couple of days as your body learns to cope with the calorie reduction.     To deal with the nutrient issue, there are two ways to tackle this problem. You can consult with a nutritionist to determine what food should be consumed or you can help supplement your diet using a Women's or Men's One-a-day pill.    As always, you should consult with your own physician before starting any new diet plan or workout regimen.

dVQdswtTaa	When medical people talk about patient privacy, we usually mean keeping their information quiet. We don't talk about your case and even need to get a signature to share information with the hospital and insurance company. <br>  <br>  What you described didn't have to happen. Respecting a patient's modesty is important and we try to do that whenever possible. In the doctor's defense, you probably could have pulled up the gown or closed the door without ruining the test, but it sounds like they didn't tell you that and you were trying to obey the instructions you were given. <br>  <br>  While what happened is embarrassing, it doesn't rise to the level of a privacy violation or malpractice. You may want to explain what happened and how you felt to the doctor so it doesn't happen again. Chances are the staff wasn't aware of how exposed you felt and would have done something had they known. They may need to make their instructions clearer to their patients.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, treating patients all the time makes you get used to seeing people in all sorts of conditions, and a patient partially exposed is not uncommon. So, we sometimes forget how it effects the patient.|`|Jwk7Ib2vaa	Although I genuinely believe that your situation is very unsettling, it's really a big deal only in your eyes. Yes, I do think the doctor erred in leaving the door open, but in order to really do anything about it, something more had to have happened. <br>  Getting gawked at while exposed must have been awful, but really, the doctor could not have prevented your gown from falling. Nor could he prevent passersby from taking a peek at your goodies. <br>  Technically, the doc didn't reveal anything personal (medical record wise) that would violate your rights. You would, however, be more than justified in giving the practitioner a piece of your mind, as well as the insurance provider for recommending him. <br>  You have done all you can, just take a breath and next time, ask the doc to come back and close the door, or any of the other people who walked by.|`|Pwybznsxaa	Yeah, i certainly would! That's some serious stuff. Maybe you can call their compliance officer and tell them what happened or the director/office supervisor. The HIPPAA Privacy Act is supposed to be enforced in all health facilities. I definitely wouldn't sit on this-as it could happen over and over again!
n6XwqMELaa	Bad Breath affects everyone at some time or another. It can be a social problem, unpleasant for others and embarrassing for the person that has it.In 9 out of 10 cases the problem originates in the mouth and not the stomach, as many people believe. Even in the cleanest mouth there are both good and bad bacteria. These bacteria live off food debris and dead skin cells.  If these bacteria multiply as a result of feeding off food debris and skin cells, they break-down, creating odour-causing compounds called Volatile Sulphur Compounds (VSC) plus other noxious smelling gases. The VSC are the most important of these gases and it is these sulphurous-smelling gases (VSC) that we know of as bad breath or 'halitosis'.<br>  <br>  Bad breath can also indicate tooth decay or gum disease, such as gingivitis or periodontitis so it is recommended that you discuss any issues with your dentist as soon as you can.
CAJAOE1Daa	Even if a food has a smaller number of calories, it may still have a lot of fat.  A double cheeseburger can easily have 20 or 30 grams, in which case it is going to be difficult to lose weight that way.  My suggestion would be eating things in moderation, with emphasis on lean proteins (like the turkey) and veggies.|`|AZecXt1caa	No lol theres a bit more to it than that, it depends on what ya eat aswell, things with high amounts of saturated fats are bad|`|gERaZGZeaa	No, you can't.  Where the nutritional value in the foods you're eating?  There's none.  No worthwhile vitamins, minerals, whole grain carbs, proteins, veggies, Essential Amino Acids, Essential Fatty Acids..... there's nothing.      You really don't know how nutrition works if you think this is going to help you.  You need to eat healthy foods that your body can use.  Right now it's just storing everything you eat as fat, because that's all it's good for.|`|YhjTbSmDaa	When I was trying to lose weight, I always tried to star under 1500 calories, but eat healthy.    I was told as long as I stayed under 1500 calories I could eat anything I wanted, but still get awy with eating junk.    NOT TRUE.    Haha, I lost 10 pounds eating healthy & staying under 1500.  As soon as I started eating junk, and even staying under 1500, I didnt gain weight, but I didnt lose any.|`|7pkxOc6Raa	No.    Btw, it really looks like you're underestimating the calories you're eating.
wXKs94nDaa	You will be bored in 5 days. Try weight watchers.|`|zMMr72aSaa	There's not enough variety in this kind of eating plan. Plus, bars and shakes are not real food. Have you ever read the ingredient list in a slim fast shake? Ew.     Just stick with whole foods and exercise. Your 30 min. cardio 5 times a week is perfect. Add some kind of resistance training 2 times a week and you're good to go.|`|S4y03v3paa	sounds great!!! but dont do just cardio. try some wights too|`|wscyjkPAaa	I think this is very doable but I don't suggest losing weight using Special K Diet and Slim Fast because once you stop you'll just gain all the weight back and then some.  You have to change your current eating habits by eating more vegetables (this will curb your hunger and give you essential vitamin).  Cut back on sweets and simple carbohydrates such as cookies or soda.  Cut back on your bad fats (bacon, extra butter stuff like that) and eat more healthy fats (avocados, flax seed oil,..etc). Your 30 minute cardio is great but you should also do some strength training (ie freeweights) nothing crazy just some easy weight training to build more muscle, (remember start slow) and remember to balance that with complex healthy carbs for energy.  Also, do the little things that will help like parking further from the office or the gym so you walk more every day, you'll be surprised how much calories this burns.  Or walking to places that are walking distance.  Do that and you'll lose a healthy 2 - 3 pounds a week of fat, you'll definately slim down but as far as overall weight, you may not lose as much as 20 pounds because muscle weighs more than fat but you will definately LOOK like you lost 20 pounds.  Good luck.

Whenever I masturbate I fall out of bed and get a concussion.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	I am frickin confused by your "question".|`|dvEiMndKaa	I dont know, it could be that when you masturbate that you are wearing yourself out which in turn might give you a negative attitude about things or make things seem like they are going bad but actually they aren't as bad as you think they are.  There is no proven fact that masturbating gives you a bad day. Try only doing it at night and see if it makes a difference.|`|kTZevQNHaa	LOL...you're superstitious and have convinced yourself of that and it's psychosomatic.<br>  I jack every single day and the quality my days' events  vary....totally unrelated to jacking or not.|`|mKmrfeX7aa	i think your penis holds the key too your destiny.|`|XXbZAriNaa	every day should be bad then|`|Vti7o1m5aa	You unconsciously have a guilty conscious about masturbation and it effects your life.

Literally. None. You're the only person who knows that you threw a beat anyway, so it's all up to your own perception, which is obviously skewed. All the examples given on both sides of the argument will be colloquial, but suffice to say that the medical community only has evidence that masturbation and sexual activity are healthy. Luck is something you invent and assign value to, something that's highly subjective. I don't have to prove you wrong because...you're not right in the first place. The burden of proof is on you, show me some research that indicates that masturbation is "bad" for your "luck".|`|EMiozFH3aa	I masturbated in the afternoon then i went to a pool party and a girls top came off and we have been going out ever since. dude this really happened i swear iam not lying to you. also you masterbating has nothing to do with your day. i do it every day and my days differ. maybe ur in a bad mood when u do it.|`|480c8670c97d5544350aa8b11691f73caa	It's all in your head (and i mean the one on your shoulders) <br>  <br>  do you have a bad day when you have a bad hair day? <br>  do you have a bad day when you get behind a slow person driving down the road?<br>  <br>  most likely not man...  you are just making your self paranoid <br>  <br>  PS.. get a girl (or guy what ever you prefer) who knows whats shes is doing and she will make you days much better!|`|4kpSLKMIaa	maybe you don't have a gf well i have had good things happen all the time its was good one time i did and the next day i got a new phone so maybe its just weird|`|II2CMc4Qaa	i have a friend that says that he masturbates every day because he likes it and because it's good luck.i believe he is right.i haven't heard anyone having your problem!!!!!!!|`|m2BCAdD3aa	If you belive masturbating grives bad luck ...i really have nothing to say , really  i dont stop smoking weeds and trying relate pleasure with astrology and that cr@p|`|I9zWF6DMaa	it could be that you are correlating you masturbating with having a bad day. maybe you should stop relating the two and you wont feel that your days are so bad!!!|`|Iww9VNBRaa	because it takes away the blood from your brain when your boy comes alive.

9EVcTnUWaa	One of the ways that I dealt with those issues was to find a way to look outside of my self.  I found a way of working with others that helped me work on developing relationships with others at my own pace and at the same time helping children who needed it. IF you like and get along with kids find a school near you that needs and accepts volenteers to come in and work with the kids. By working with kids you won't feel as much pressure as if you were dealing with adults,  Most programs only ask you for two to five hours a week, which means that you can keep it short and sweet.  Once you start to understand and to realize how much you're helping that child or children and what a difference it will make in their lives, you'll start to feel better about yourself.  You will be developing relationships with other adults as you work with the kids, how far you take those relationships is mostly up to you.  If working with kids isn't you thing than find something that you can commit to and to give you a start in an area where their won't be a lot of pressure and things will come more naturally.  Soon you'll find yourself dealing with the kids and the adults with out having to justify yourself to any one,  Your reason for being will be evident in the work that you do and your commitment to the job that you're doing.  Once you feel better about yourself as a person and the contribution you make in the wider world the less you'll feel the need to have to justify your existence.  Your life will speak for you and any one who doesn't understand that you don't need in your life.|`|UVdviQMPaa	''looking for validation from others.''...... You know that issue is so common. After a while you sense there are some people that will never be nice no matter what you do . I separate everyone into two groups immediately. The winner-players are the largest group and I try to deal with them as little as possible. The others are outsiders like  myself and worthy of helping and even befriending. Don't spin your wheels.

8BqDLxR6aa	That product has a lot of extra sugar in it. Also other things that you don't need are in it. Just get plain creatine monohydrate. Cheaper and will work better than that product, which has unneeded ingredients.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to some creatine that is only about $20.<br>  <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/hp/creatine.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/hp/cre...</a><br>  <br>  Creatine does add some water weight, but it won't make you look bloated.

iK3YYRaTaa	I most definately would check blood sugar my self. 59 is Hypoglycemic. Not good . Are the test strips less than 90 from opening. <br>  heres glucoselevels (Normal)<br>  <br>  What Are Normal Blood Glucose And Blood Sugar Levels<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There are various methods to determine blood glucose level. Some tests give you accurate diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes, while others will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes. <br>  <br>  Fasting Blood Sugar Test:<br>  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test. <br>  <br>  Random Blood Glucose Test:<br>  Random blood Glucose test gives your blood sugar at any time in a day. Normal random blood sugar level should be less than 200mg/dl. If your random blood glucose level is between 140mg/dl to 200mg/dl then you will have pre-diabetes. <br>  <br>  Oral glucose tolerance test<br>  This test measures your response to sugar. First we measure fasting blood glucose level, and then glucose solution is given, after that we measure blood glucose after 1 hour and 2hours. A normal blood glucose level after an oral glucose tolerance test is less than 140 mg/dL. Level between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL suggests pre-diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after you drink the glucose solution may suggest that you have diabetes mellitus. <br>  <br>  Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test<br>  This test is not for diagnosing diabetes, but it shows you how well you have controlled your sugar in last 2 or 3 months. Normal value is less than 7%, however if it is more than 7 then you and your doctor should think of changing your treatment of diabetes. <br>  <br>  Always Remember, your blood glucose measurement alone is not enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do some other tests to find out which type of diabetes you have. <br>  Hypoglycemia Symptoms<br>  Because epinephrine, one of the hormones that is activated by hypoglycemia, comes from the central nervous system, the majority of early symptoms of hypoglycemia are related to the nervous system. <br>    Common symptoms of hypoglycemia include the following: <br>    Trembling <br>    Clamminess <br>    Palpitations <br>    Anxiety <br>    Sweating <br>    Hunger <br>  <br>    Because the brain is deprived of glucose, a second set of symptoms follows: <br>    Difficulty in thinking <br>    Confusion <br>    Headache <br>    Seizures <br>    Coma <br>    Ultimately, death <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your baby.|`|3d468382b9916af91478507ac6fc79e4aa	Typically the one hour glucose gestational glucose test is given with a 50 gm glucose drink load ( given without regard to prior meals or drink).  This is a SCREEN for gestational diabetes, not definitive.   You can be positive aon a screen and NOT have gestational diabetes.  The only way to know is to take the 3 hr challenge.<br>   <br>  The definitive test is the 3 hr glucose tolerance - fasting specimen is drawn,a 100 gm glucose drink load is given and then blood is drawn at 1hr, 2hr and 3hr after glucose drink is ingested. This is what the American Diabetes Assn. recommends.<br>  <br>  Glucose levels vary constantly throughout the day and night.  Your level of 59 cannot be compared to the test value of 146 - different times, different specimens.  It's like comparing apples and oranges.    Ask your dr. about monitoring your levels, but  it probably is not necessary unless you are having any symptoms.  While 59 is on the low side, it is not unheard of.  Talk to your dr.  Eat regular meals.<br>  <br>  Most of all, do not worry!   While a family history is a concern, it is your results that count.  Most cases of gestational diabetes are treated with diet and monitoring alone.  Go for the test and talk to your dr.  I hope all works out for you.<br>  Read the link below for more info.|`|F08HDRvraa	If your blood sugar dropped to 59, you very well may have gestational diabetes.  Normal blood sugars are between 70-110.  When you have diabetes your blood sugar can elevate to higher levels and drop to lower levels.  It actually would be a good idea for you to keep track of your blood sugar for a while.

xKYXurpNaa	You sound like you're on the right track!    Vitamin D you can get by being in the sun, it's also in dairy products so if you drink milk or eat cheese you probably get enough.    Take a multivitamin to ensure you're getting enough micronutrients if you're low on calories and for overall health especially for your skin.|`|R73aJ9qtaa	Invest in grocery delivery like peapod.  you're lacking protein in your diet, tofu wont cut it.  Eat chicken, fish, and lean beef.  Purchase multi-vitmains, vitamin-D, and C.  Drink plenty of water, and purchase grains that are whole grain/wheat.|`|8YPJsS9yaa	You need to start eating protein in the morning. Egg whites and fruit perhaps. For lunch, go with a salad with low fat dressing.  For dinner, eat  fish or chicken (should be the size of your fist) and vegetables.     If you need to snack between meals, try a protein bar or fruit.    Also, take a multi-vitamin.    You can get your vitamin D from the sun. Try to go outside for 20 min a day.  Take a walk, shovel, clean out the garage, wash your car.|`|A9RwFu6maa	You sound like you need more protein, and green veggies..spinach is top notch...black beans, homemade chili is great.  Not drinking pop would be fantastic.  Eat oatmeal w/o sugar...instead use raisins and some walnuts.  Coffee is okay (actually healthy for men in moderation) So one cup is perfect...drink it black, or with fat free creamer. (sugar free too) Eat small meals throughout the day...over 2 1/2 hours or so to keep Blood sugar stable.  Chicken is great (if you aren't a vegetarian, and fish once a week.  I actually use diabetic cook books (e.i. how everyone should cook...), they won't load up sugars and carbs that you don't need.  But remember carbs are energy, so you still need plenty..the food pyramid is a perfect ex.  go to foodpyramid,gov

ABdIosm2aa	first, congratulations for getting healthy and recognizing the eating disorder as a problem. Next, please keep in mind that your body is now able to build muscle, a lot that was lost during your dramatic weight loss. Don't forget to take into consideration your monthly cycle for water weight too. You will even out, once you get back to a healthy weight, so do not panic that you will gain a pound a day forever. You are rebuilding healthy muscle in areas that you cannot even see, like your heart! Good luck and stay on the right track, you are doing great!|`|XWTnestHaa	It will take at least 6 months for your body to stabilize after an eating disorder. I used to suffer from bulimia and anorexia and I am now happy with the weight I am... but when I first was getting through it I constantly watched the scale. But you need to go by the measurements and not the scale, weight is going to come and go for a while until you get your body back to normal and your metabolism doesn't think you are starving it anymore.   Hang in there! 120 is still very thin! You have nothing to worry about.|`|wscyjkPAaa	First off, check with your doctor what your normal bodyweight and body fat percentage should be.  Since you are recovering your body is still adjusting to your new diet and activities.  So it will take more than a couple of months for everything to even out.  You're weight gain can be from a number of things, muscle, water, fat, more dense bones, the only way to absolutely know for sure is to check with your doctor.  But I think you're doing a great job of eating healthy and excercising, long as you feel strong and good about yourself, I see nothing wrong.|`|zZoGjvnTaa	It sounds like water weight and muscle weight. When I was going through a difficult period being anorexic (for a little under a year), I not only turned away food, but I turned away liquid, too i was usually dehydrated. This changed when i started eating normally again. I also gained back some weight.    Your body needs a lot of fluids, your cells are highly composed of water and other essential water-soluble things. You are probably just gaining back the weight from the things you previously deprived yourself of. This is ok. In fact, this is a good thing.    The most important thing is for you to think about your health more than your weight. If you feel ok, and you and the people around you consider you a "normal eater," this is a huge compliment and a huge success. It took me a long time (because I started to develop digestive problems) but it sounds like you're on the right track.    Also, you know your body best. For some people, fluctuations in weight are normal even in a single day! I (and some friends I have talked to about it) have the remarkable ability to gain or lost about 10 pounds in a week. And it doesn't bother me at all. Get in tune with your body's cycles and you'll figure out what's best!    Lastly, keep one thing in mind: Please don't exercise too much...this is dangerous if you are under-nourished.|`|zMMr72aSaa	First of all, you need to stop weighing yourself so much!!! Throw out the scale, if you truly want to recover.    Weight will fluctuate day to day because of water weight. If you're doing any kind of resistance training, you could just be gaining muscle weight, which is good--it will make you look healthy instead of sickly.    You've got to stop exercising so much. I'm assuming it's just cardio, correct? Force yourself to limit cardio to 30-60 minutes a day. And you must do some resistance training twice a week. It will make you feel strong and healthy!!! And no, you won't get "bulky".     I strongly encourage you to continue (or start) therapy with an eating disorder specialist, because it sounds like you still could use the professional support.    Good luck to you, and best in health. Anorexia nervosa is a tough disease to recover from, but you can do it if you want it!!!|`|mXtsmTdaaa	It could be many factors but by the information you have given its muscle weight, keep going and congratulations on the recovery|`|Cdp02p0Xaa	too much and no exercise.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	if you're eating healthy and exercising it's either water weight or muscle.   in the fall I did cross country and lost 10 pounds in fat but gained 7 pounds in muscle :D if your measurements are the same, then it should be muscle :)|`|ZUeFSp7Zaa	if you were anorexic than that wieght gain is good and it all shouldn't be muscle you should eat enough to feel healthy too... i am healthy and i eat what i want but i choose healthy choices if i can help it... exercising that much is definatly excessive... you could hurt yourself...     and your wieght depends on how tall you are and your body type so i cant be sure what wieght is right for you based on that...     i am very healthy (took an inbody test) and they told me that i need not gain or loose any wieght but i am slightly under the normal amount of body fat for a girl... and i am 5' 9 and wiegh almost 150  and my wieght flutuates all the time it is normal for a young girl... sometimes ill be 147 and  143  in the same week though i've done nothing different      you should see if you could take this test|`|wDtA9hrhaa	Dont weigh yourself. Scales lie! They can make 10 pound differences, especially if you are a women.  Women seem to bloat out more than men and can cause a 5 pound weight difference. I'm sure your real weight is 115.|`|1htCWW7waa	all the fat that you store from eating , was neing used whilst you didnt eat anything , now you are eating again the fat is super released and you will start to gain weight you stored
6sTsDvKmaa	You say part of you doesn't believe in love, but that means that a part of you does.  Being that you've never been in a relationship, it may be easier for you to assume that it isn't worth the effort.  After all, there's a lot of negative sides.  You have to compromise, and share, and, you risk being hurt.  But there's a lot of good, too.  You always have someone in your corner.  You always have someone to share things with.      There's nothing silly about human emotion.  In fact, it's what makes us human.  Yeah, some people's emotion based actions are silly.  But love itself is a noble concept.      I feel like your skepticism comes from some kind of bitterness you have from not being able to carelessly fall in love like so many people do.  And that's okay.  I'm 24, and I've never really been in love, either.  But I figure I'm still young, and even if I have to wait until I'm 65, I'll still believe that there's someone out there for me.  When it happens it'll be nothing like what the media makes it out to be.  It'll be what it is.  It'll be real life.     There's nothing wrong with being single, you should enjoy it!  Especially nowadays, it is very hard to find someone to trust.  I've read that love is not about finding someone else, but finding yourself in someone else.  Frankly, that's something I would like to experience.      One or two good friends is way better than 8 or 9 'associates' that you can't ever really trust.     It's unfortunate that your parents fight a lot, but sometimes it's necessary.  And healthy.  No couple has ever stayed married long term without a couple of good fights.  Just because your parents fight a lot, doesn't mean that you'll end up that way.  Learn from their mistakes. Find alternate ways to meet your problems.     I think your feelings are normal.  Don't worry about it.  Just be happy with who you are and everything else will fall into place.|`|0ujpiBTCaa	Save this and read it again in 20 years.  You think you are too good for love or sex?Too intelligent for sex? You need to get over yourself, quickly. You have serious issues beyond the depression. Are you seeing someone about all of this?    It is FINE to be single and happy with that at 21, you are still a kid in many ways. That said, you need to think about and adress your issues with interpersonal relationships, as those will hold you back in every aspect of life.    Edit:   To address the original question, emotional and social well-being are 2/3 of health. Whether you need to have romantic love, or at least have experienced it, to accomplish those things is debatable..|`|PkRQNrUWaa	you and i are in the same boat.. *hugs*|`|3VhRpzExaa	Well all I know is that kissing is healthy...I got one of those chain messages and it said that in there.
AA11660242	Whoever sais that has no idea what they're talking about. When done right, squats work out not only the thighs, but the butt and the lower back.|`|GgBdQqrdaa	it just feels bigger, they work out the tighs calfs and lower back muscles..    your but is getting tigheter ... thats why it feels bigger.|`|PyAxwuqWaa	i guess beacues its exercizing u lose wieght?|`|87sj8YBGaa	Those people are talking about adult butts.  Adult butts have tons of fat and squats help lose fat.  But in younger people, there is less fat, so more muscle is built.|`|bjqjkDMHaa	Eh, I've been squatting repeatedly (believe me, if I could have stopped, I would) for serveral weeks.  This is due to Tourette's syndrome, but anyway.  All it has done to me is make my knees pop, sometimes painfully, but is a good exercise.   Whether or not your but gets any smaller.
Z4Y0tHOxaa	did u know that sometimes our bodies crave what we lack? for instance i crave chocolate when my blood sugar is low, or wheni'm anaemic, i might fancy the odd steak. maybe u really need some vitamin c, or maybe the tastes of the foods in your diet may be too sweet, so your craving something sour to counteract that. i craved vinegar last week, vinegar and carrots. no i'm not pregnant, i got my pmt, lol|`|AA11364723	You are probably not pregnant.  I'd say your hormones just haven't adjusted back to normal yet from having just recently been pregnant.  That takes some time.  Hang in there.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear about your miscarriages.|`|b05fe691e5ceb5cc16ca919cd11e5eccaa	I would suggest seeing a doctor if you aren't certain. You may or may not be but the only way to find out for certain is to see your OB.
2dya7YeKaa	Likely the money isn't there.  Whether or not research is done largely comes down to funding.  Because most labs are more interested in working on stuff that is killing a lot of people (cancer, AIDS, etc.).  People with diseases that they can live with are put on the back burner.  It is sad because of course these people are in pain and their quality of life is dramatically affected but that is the way it is.

You want to feed the muscles that you just tore down when you exercised. I wouldn't do a huge meal, but something with protein is great.|`|wXKs94nDaa	Well, if you want you can eat but I think you should wait 30 minutes.|`|lYkvps54aa	i heard you should wait for 1 hour and then eat as your body will be craving for some energy.|`|z99EZvCNaa	I don't see a problem with that, instead of a meal though, maybe a high protein bar/shake or something like that.  In fact, I was recommended by a friend of mine who's a personal trainer to take in a high protein snack soon post workout, preferably within the half hour.|`|OdrZj1ZVaa	a protein shake within the first half hour after your workout then about an hour or two after that have a real meal.

AA12358000	Agrona,<br>  “Old Hag Syndrome" sometimes referred to as "Night Hag" is another commonly used term for Sleep Paralysis – SP - among many different cultures mainly in the western world. The term Old Hag is probably derived from a couple of sources, one being the word for Nightmare; Night -of course, we know this already, Mare being derived from the old English term Maere meaning demon or incubus - an incubus is believed to be a demon that visits during the night. SP is a common medical condition and usually tagged these days as a Sleeping Disorder. The most remarkable symptoms of SP are the accompanying audio and/or visual hallucinations often causing extreme terror and panic in it's sufferers, who more often than not mistakenly believe they are being visited by aliens, malevolent beings and other evil presences. Research shows that SP is linked with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. When in REM sleep you are usually dreaming, your body does not act out your dreams as you will hurt either yourself, or someone else, so evolution has worked its merry little way of getting your brain to “switch off” your muscles and relax you while dreaming, essentially paralyzing you to a degree. The cause for a state of SP is when your mind wakes up, usually still in a semi-REM state, but your body is still relaxed and semi paralyzed, bringing on the sometimes horrifying sensation of being paralyzed while still in a semi-dream state yet awake. The consequences of this state are usually nothing short of terrifying to individuals with their dreams suddenly becoming reality as they are trapped in an in-between state of consciousness. The usual result is panic to try to release oneself while sleep creeps around your brain like a slow fog trying to drag you back down to it's depths again. Of course there are many other symptoms besides the paralysis and hallucinations, sometimes including shooting pains in the arms, back, neck or head, paralysis of only one limb (partial paralysis), choking and suffocating feeling, pressure on other parts of the body such as back, neck, arms or legs the feeling of someone touching you, feelings of an evil presence behind or beside you, and sometimes squeezing or hugging around your body. The most commonly reported cause of SP episodes is in fact stress. It is believed that stress can seriously alter sleep patterns, causing episodes of sleep paralysis. Another cause can be your sleeping position. Reports and research by Dr. J. A. Cheyne show that sufferers sleeping in the face up position are five times more likely to suffer an episode of sleep paralysis than others who attempt to sleep in a different position during normal sleep. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

wXKs94nDaa	- Whole wheat bread with egg white scrambled   - green salad with tuna/leanchicken and sprouts|`|zMMr72aSaa	I don't have specific recipes, but here are some things to consider:    1) Low fat foods: fruits, veggies, whole grains, fish, white meat chicken, lean cuts of pork (pork loin, etc.), lean cuts of beef (no prime rib), low fat or fat free dairy (2% or less), low fat or fat free salad dressings, egg whites, limit yolks.    2) Fiber: fresh fruits, fresh veggies, whole grains (e.g., steel cut oatmeal, 100% whole wheat bread). I make sure to have one big salad with a protein once a day, for example. Also, beans have a ton of fiber (as well as protein and iron and they are cheap.) Throw some in that salad.    One warning about dietary fiber: increase it slowly, or else it may cause gas. And, make sure you drink a lot of water.    3) To decrease blood pressure: decrease your body weight, and cut the salt/sodium.

wXKs94nDaa	My aunt did....he said that you eat really small portion of regular food. So just cut down your portions. If you want to eat and lose weight then I suggest weight watchers.|`|xKYXurpNaa	A couple clients of mine have tried nutri-system and have grew tired of it because they give you some food, but you have to buy additional stuff and prepare it.    If you are extremely busy and stuck at home with your children it may work for you but IMHO you're better off with Weight Watchers because it teaches you for the long term how to control your caloric intake while eating normal foods.|`|637l0mkAaa	I agree with those who say you should try Weight Watchers.  I lost over 60 lbs with it.  They teach you how to eat and you keep track of daily points and can earn extra points through exercise.  Plus, you don't have to buy their food, but if you want to, you can get it in stores, except for certain things they only sell at meetings.  But again, you don't have to buy any of their stuff.  With diets like Nutrisystem and Jenny Craig, you have to buy their food, but they don't really teach you to cook healthy foods for yourself.  Plus, with Weight Watchers, you can go to meetings and get support from others, which can also help you lose weight and keep if off.|`|a4jI0xgYaa	I bought it last month, but unfortunately couldn't stand the food long enough to see if it worked.  It was really bad.  So I spend $300 on food that I'm not going to eat. So my suggestion is to check eBay or Craigslist for NutriSystem meals and just buy like a week or two worth before shelling out hundreds of dollars.  Check out this article on how to spend less on NutriSystem:    http://www.ehow.com/how_4741827_spend-le...|`|zMMr72aSaa	I wouldn't recommend Nutrisystem. You're not learning anything and you'll just gain the weight back when you stop buying their food. It's a waste of money. Marie Osmond got paid for what she did, too.

0ujpiBTCaa	Your BMI is 20.8, so no, not chubby.    Normal is 18.5-24.9, 25 is clinically overweight so a person would start looking a little rounded well before that.    Edit:  'you're not really overweight. You aren't "hot" or "sexy" '  Your body density does NOT determine if you are sexy or not!  That dude is nuts.   Congrats on going veg! And if you are a dancer, you probably have good muscle, which makes you weigh more.|`|B4ORpmS9aa	No way.That is hot.|`|DnvysKlkaa	lol are you retarded?|`|HBx6q05Oaa	You are at the ideal body weight.

That is normal. Anything under that is probably too skinny to be healthy.  A body needs some fat to function.|`|YGX5pI5Caa	No way.|`|3YfYWpAsaa	It depends on if that is a "high muscle %" 125 or a "low muscle %" 125.    If you (obviously its you) have a high % of muscle, that means you will have a slimmer waistline and slimmer body in general- since muscle weighs more than fat, it TAKES UP LESS SURFACE AREA.    But if you don't exercise much and you are a chubby, higher-fat-% 125, that wouldn't be TOO bad, but it certainly wouldn't look good like you would be if u were all muscle 125.    Lastly, if alot of that weight is in her boobs, that helps alot too; for example if she has a C cup or more than that explains why she doesn't weigh less... and it means she has more weight in the good spot and less in the bad spots. (But if she's relatively flat-chested, thats a bad thing obviously, and it also means she will be fatter than if she had boobs... since the weight is instead around her waist, etc.)|`|jnG8sOzWaa	kinda
ZimDrQL1aa	Everyone has a different starting point for anorexia, for instance mine started as a way to combat depression. Some of the other more common reasons include: need to find control, a coping mechanism, a type of self harm, or a diet taken to the extreme. I would definitely suggest talking to her about it and the possibility of her seeing a therapist, because the longer she has it the lower her chances of a complete recovery become. Don't push too hard though, because her first instinct will be to become defensive and then to pull away more. After all, isolation is one of the many symptoms of anorexia.|`|1WS4vTdcaa	It can be very difficult because anorexics will be able to give you very good reasons for their behaviour and are usually very strong minded so are difficult to convince of a different point of view.  Try and think of it as something like being colour blind.  However much you tell someone who is colour blind what colour you see, they will keep seeing what they see.  It's the same with someone who is anorexix, they see things their way.<br>  <br>  Remember as well that a bad experience doesn't have to be something that you would consider a bad experience.  Anorexics are often high achievers so it could be a way of addressing their feelings of being inferior or not reaching their own high standards, when to everyone else they do amazing things.<br>  <br>  These are all generalisations.<br>  <br>  Try asking her what she wants most in the world.  That will help you to understand what is important to her.  Then talk about ways she can achieve that.  But I think your best bet is to get her to talk to a professional - which could be difficult!! Anorexia can cause serious health issues though so the earlier it is addressed the better.|`|1R5fFC5uaa	exactly like me.<br>  what triggered it..was the fact that someone called me fat<br>  sometimes its just a remark and it makes you think you're fat when you're not. Also pressure and depression can lead to anorexia...i have it :( its not nice....i know but trust me she will over come it because i am slowly eating more...you just need to reassure her..but try reallyhard because it will be difficult to convince her

X1DktFmHaa	Was he rough or were you relaxed when it started?    If he wasn't and you were fine, then I wouldn't worry about it. He may have just irritated a spot on your rectum's wall a little. Next time use lube to prevent this.     However this is why you should always use a condom with anal sex. It allows viruses to spread easier. Pre-lubed condoms make anal sex a breeze and also make for easy clean-up or clean hole switching, though you may want to use even more lube depending on your preferences.       If the bleeding continues or you think it is unrelated to the anal sex, see a doctor please.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	This bleeding does not sound normal but I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.
ZcrAfbikaa	It takes about 2 weeks for your body to get used to the medication, and another week before you can notice the medication working or not working. Everyone's body reacts differently to each medication. <br>  <br>  All side effects you need to record and monitor that way you can report it back to your doctor. My eyes sometimes dilate, and my husband says it is a neurological response. Some people's eyes naturally dilate (without medication), but this could be a side effect of the medication exclusive to you.  <br>  <br>  Celexa was the first antidepressant I tried, and after one month found out it was not the right one for me. I'm on my second, and I feel much better. When I was on Celexa, my eyes dilated at night, and my first warning sign that it wasn't right for me was migraines. I had a migraine every night for nine nights in a row. I also had suicidal thoughts for the first time (WAY SCARY!!!) Bad side effects, and that is why I switched.<br>  <br>  Make sure you pay extra attention to anything different that happens to your body, especially in the first month. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck! Keep watching for a bit, and if anything large or alarming happens- let your doctor know! Hopefully it is just a temporary side effect and it will work out for you! :)<br>  <br>  Edit: Also, never remove yourself off an antidepressant without consulting your doctor!! The withdraw from the medication could cause you to have side effects worse than when you were on them... Always ask your doctor and he can help get you off of them SAFELY!|`|8KTr8n3kaa	It's never normal for your pupils to change.

xKYXurpNaa	This totally depends on your goals.  If your primary goal is to improve your cardio endurance, then you should perform your cardio first while you have the most available energy.    If you are looking to gain muscle, weights first because you need to devote your energy to weight training more than cardio.    If you're simply trying to lose weight, cardio after is better because weight training uses up your carb stores and your cardio is most likely going to burn fat and also will burn more calories because your heart rate will already be elevated from the weight training.    FOCUS on your goals and accomplish them one at a time.|`|WdOAxQmoaa	i do weights then 15 min cardio then more weights(2hours). i want to get bigger so thats my goal.|`|l10HMKG4aa	If you use weights after cardio, your muscles will already be warmed up, therefore you are less likely to pull a muscle.|`|AZecXt1caa	Before :p ya need to warm up your muscles first|`|MoNePl6naa	Cardio training before you lift can warm up your muscles. However, depending on the intensity of the cardio workout, your muscles might become fatigued resulting in a less effective lifting session.     Some people prefer to do interval type training, in which you could perform a lift and then run a few laps, alternating aerobic (cardio) and anaerobic (lifting) training. This could be difficult depending on where the weights are located in relation to cardio equipment at your gym.     As for seeing more results, it does not really matter what order you perform them in. To lose weight calories you take in has to be less than what you expend, and more calories will be burned with more lean muscle mass.|`|oNR7il8baa	I tend to alternate.   I start off with running/jogging. Then do some weight work.

SnkaH7W6aa	This is what I do:  1 24oz. cup of low fat or fat free yogurt, coffee with sweetener, 1/2 grapefruit.  The yogurt is complete protein and the active cultures get the digestion going, the coffee is actually a fat burner and some ingredient in the grapefruit causes the coffee to burn fat longer.  In addition, yogurt, for some reason, helps to get rid of belly fat.  For lunch I usually have 2 slices of European Rye Bread which I buy at a Russian store.  Any lunchmeat is fine, I do not buy extra lean and usually I put butter on my bread.  For supper I have lots of lean meat and vegetables and for snacks I have fruit.  So far have I lost 35 lbs with this.  Sometimes I eat 1/2 grapefruit in between, but I never eat more than 1 large or 2 small grapefruits.  I go swimming and walking almost every day and that takes care of exercising.      What's important to remember here is that juyices and alcoholic beverages are loaded with sugars and should be consumed very limited or avoided alltogether.  Also, drinking water helps, especially if you drink a large glass right before eating--you'll be amazed how quickly you are full.....I hope this helps|`|3jGGzCUJaa	Start by doing something together & simple like going for a walk you two can bond & talk about anything while the walking helps with burning calories. You probably wont even realise its working out. Then once she starts to feel & look better she'll start to want to do more You can then throw in something else.

u0160kdXaa	Everybody is well aware of the "musical fruit". A lot of it has to do with digestion, though. Like swallowing your food with out chewing it thoroughly. <br>  <br>  But, mostly it comes from eating animal products. Which, believe it or not, the human body is not really designed to ingest. For instance, milk is specifically designed for baby mammals. As the animal gets older it becomes lactose intolerant. This can easily be seen by giving your older cat or dog a bowl of milk. They will get the runs.<br>  <br>  I know a lot of people will argue against this. But, this is only because humans have been eating animal products for long that they actually think it is normal.<br>  <br>  Lactose intolerance results from a lack of an enzyme (lactase) needed to digest the sugar (lactose) in dairy products. Symptoms of lactose intolerance are:<br>  bullet  Abdominal cramping, pain, and bloating after drinking milk or eating other dairy products<br>  bullet  Gas and diarrhea<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.luc.edu/wellness/selfcare/abdominal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.luc.edu/wellness/selfcare/abd...</a><br>  <br>  Individuals who suffer from the condition known as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are often at risk of lapses in health and the condition of their bowels due to over consumption of red meats. This is because generally red meats take longer than any other kind of meat to digest and make their way through the human body.<br>  <br>  As unpleasant it is to talk about it is a fact that whilst making its journey through the human body this red meat can quite simply ‘go off’ and in doing so will begin to release levels of toxins into the system that can bring about an acute episode for an Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) sufferer. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://tummytrouble.co.uk/red-meat-and-your-stomach.html" rel="nofollow">http://tummytrouble.co.uk/red-meat-and-y...</a><br>  <br>  It can also happen from just eating way too fast and too much for your body to handle all at once.<br>  <br>  If you are doing research, I hope this helps. If you have abdominal pain that is persistant then you might want to see a doctor as it could be a warning sign that something is wrong.|`|CEoCe9ENaa	Onions upset me, and some breads can cause wind.|`|l8vZ2nJkaa	baked beans, if you've been eating a diet full of fruit and veg and not much meat this can also give you pain and wind

4hsrILZbaa	See your healthcare provider about some form of birth control that can help regulate and ease your periods. You may be having such a hard time with menstruation for a few reasons. First, you aren't used to it, which in and of itself is probably strange for you. Secondly, all the feelings, both emotional and physical that go along with your period can make a prior eating disorder flare up. (Things like bloating, increasd appetite, etc.)<br>  <br>  I have very bad periods, so I've been on birth control since I was 16. Yes, there is a shot (Depo-Provera) that can keep your period away, or very light (<a href="http://www.birth-control-comparison.info/bcdepo.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.birth-control-comparison.info...</a> but only your healthcare provider can decide which birth control is right for you.

785d90a6b488b988abb3d06bde5e2ae9aa	Cert. Fitness Trainer    Well to start some people see it as a Bessing and/or a Curse to have a High or Fast Metabolism. But this is usually not the case for all your life. Right now your young and just entering your growth cycles of life. If you have a fast metabolism you dont want to slow it down. This of it this way if you build a fire and its burning super hot and then you cut to air flow to it then it will burn at a lower temp or go out. If you lower the temp its sometimes hard to get that heat back or restart that fire.    You body works the same way! You can eat all you want but its what you eat and not how much you eat. You looking to gain weight thru muscle mass and not by getting fat. If your going to be big might as well be healthy about it.    Candy will do nothing for you other then give a short burst of energy,raise your blood sugar and rote your teeth.  To build Lean Muscle Mass you need to eat alot of protein: Chicken Breast, Fish and take a daily multi-vitamin. There is no limit to veggies and if you have a sweet tooth eat fruit. Combine this all with a good weight lifting workout and you will start to build mass in no time.  But it will not happen overnight! It is a way of life but you have to work at it! Good Luck!    RDW|`|JiATH6rGaa	You can affect your metabolism but I wouldn't write off a fast metabolism as a curse. Your metabolism will slow down more than likely once you're older. You're growing right now.     I would focus on eating healthy. Increase your calories if you want to but don't increase them by just eating junk. Try some weight training too. Try to eat at least your weight in protein (115 grams a day for you) but try to split them evenly across the day. Make sure you get plenty of preferably complex carbs for energy too. Analyze your diet and if you're not getting enough nutriets I'd look into a natural multivitamin. Nature's Way Alive are pretty good. You have to get protein and calcium as your growing! You need to give your body something to build with.     If you weight train enough and eat enough you could be lucky and increase in size and still be lean.     Good luck either way. I had that problem when I was a teenager. Now I've got about 10 pounds of fat that I could do without.

If you eat healthy and exercise, it is probably a thyroid problem. This , in your case, means your food digests way too fast. You are probably NOT anorexic but should see the doctor anyways.<br>  One thing that adds weight is exercising because muscles add pounds. You should really ignore those boys because it is none of their business. Also, make sure you have enough fat intake. You neeeeeeeed sugars and fats too! they are a part of the food pyramid. Dont forget that you should never have a low self -esteem or feel bad about yourself because (Gen.1:27) says that you are made in the image of God. Always remember that you are unique and special in your own way.

It can be a social problem, unpleasant for others and embarrassing for the person that has it.In 9 out of 10 cases the problem originates in the mouth and not the stomach, as many people believe. Even in the cleanest mouth there are both good and bad bacteria. These bacteria live off food debris and dead skin cells.  If these bacteria multiply as a result of feeding off food debris and skin cells, they break-down, creating odour-causing compounds called Volatile Sulphur Compounds (VSC) plus other noxious smelling gases. The VSC are the most important of these gases and it is these sulphurous-smelling gases (VSC) that we know of as bad breath or 'halitosis'.<br>  <br>  Bad breath can also indicate tooth decay or gum disease, such as gingivitis or periodontitis so it is recommended that you discuss any issues with your dentist as soon as you can.|`|X1pCRnhGaa	Maybe you have a rotten tooth that you can't see all of?<br>  Or talk to a dr. maybe it's not your teeth/mouth causing the bad breath?

dpgXzMenaa	You're not too young for tampons unless you've never had a period.<br>  <br>  The ones with plastic applicators *definitely* make things easier for girls who've never used tampons before... but once you know how, anything that's comfortable to wear will be easy to insert. If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|qfSKgxDsaa	You can use tampons.  Her's are probably way to big for you.  Start out with getting the "Teen" tampons they are labeled "slight" or "light"  now this is to just get you used to using them, so you'll want to wear a pad too to catch when it leaks because they don't have much absorbancy.  But as you get used to these you can move up to regular and then super and on if you need too...Once you go to a higher absorbancy, you won't need to wear a pad, well I don't...you may want to wear a panty liner or something just in case, but I find them annoying...you just have to figure out about how long you can go without leaking, good luck hun!|`|b05fe691e5ceb5cc16ca919cd11e5eccaa	You are never to young to try using a tampon. I was nervous at first and I hated using them because it hurt to put them in. I later tried again and finally got used to it.

9yCspHn1aa	Here's a paper my brother wrote for health class. Hopefully it helps you out some. It's all true. You need to go to a doctor who knows what they're talking about. Please read it, it won't be a waste of your time, I promise.           <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>             When somebody thinks of Lyme disease, they think that it’s a no-big-deal disease one can catch from a deer tick. All a person has to do is check for a bull’s eye rash and take some antibiotics for a few weeks and they would be fine,right?  This most certainly is not the case, and scarily enough even some doctor’s don’t realize so. Because of information people are unaware of, Lyme disease is not an easy diagnosis.<br>  <br>              One major problem about the diagnosis of Lyme disease is that some doctors are simply lacking information on the disease. Believe it or not, some don’t even think it’s a real disease. Most doctors will tell a patient that they can only have Lyme if there was a bull’s eye rash present from a deer tick bite, but the act of the matter is that a rash is actually rare with Lyme. Another thing is the disease can be transmitted through many different sources other than deer ticks. It has been proven that it can be found in blood, saliva, through sexual intercourse, breast milk, and can even be passed on to a baby through the womb.Lyme coming from other insects, such as mosquitoes, is also very much believed.In the movie Under Our Skin, a documentary about Lyme disease, one doctor said that there has been no record of a baby catching it from the womb.Yet, another clearly states it has happened, babies have died from it, and there is indeed recorded evidence of it in their death certificates. Also, some doctors believe that chronic Lyme disease does not exist, but a researcher found that the spirochetes can hide in gel-like cysts, rendering them undetectable and hard to cure. Many doctors are simply ignorant towards facts and will not admit that they are wrong. Because of this and more, Lyme is very often misdiagnosed.<br>  <br>              Lyme disease is overly misdiagnosed as other diseases. These misdiagnoses can actually be fatal to the patient, for the medicine involved could worsen the disease. For instance, a huge disease it is mistaken for is Multiple sclerosis,or MS, and the treatment for that uses steroids. Steroids not only make Lyme worse, but it can cause the spirochetes to go into a cystic form in which they are protected and hidden from all antibiotics and even tests. This often causes chronic Lyme disease, and can sometimes render it incurable. Other examples of misdiagnoses include Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, or being labeled as “crazy,” meaning the doctors tell their patient it’s all in their head because they will not admit that they don’t know what is wrong. As a Lyme patient myself, I have had symptoms for 8 years, and I even had a tick bite when they started occurring. Some doctors said it was anxiety,or other psyche issues. One doctor actually made things up in my medical chart,saying I have family history of some of those symptoms, which is a blatant lie. Luckily, I was found to have it after my sister tested positive for it last year. I probably wouldn’t have been found to have it, if it weren’t for my doctor who used a new test in California that is proven to work more.<br>  <br>              The two main tests for Lyme disease do not work well enough. They have been proven to have false negatives, false positives, and are only known to work very little.The Elisa test works 1/5 of the time when searching for Lyme disease, and the Western Blot is only slightly better. The thing about this that does not make sense is that when using the CDC standards, a person is to test on the Elisa first, and if they only test positive, they then go to the Western Blot. So,essentially, one takes the worst test first, and if that patient tests negative for it, the doctors will refuse to give them the Western Blot. In my opinion,both tests should be thrown out the door. This is because there is a test known to work much better called the IgenX lab test in California, which searches for more strands of borrelia, the infection that causes Lyme.Sadly, some insurance companies don’t cover it, and it’s very hard to find a doctor who knows enough about Lyme disease who is willing to agree to it.<br>  <br>              The subject of Lyme disease is a scary one. It is often misdiagnosed and is incredibly controversial. Sadly, the majority of the tests simply do not work,such as the standard Western Blot. It’s so hard for one to find a“Lyme-literate” doctor out there, and because of CDC standards, doctors seem to want to diagnose any disease aside from it. Lyme disease is a very large,incredibly serious problem that needs to be addressed soon, and doctors need to learn to diagnose it more. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  **And this is only SOME info.

If you do have Lyme, taking prednisone could make it harder to treat later.<br>  <br>  People with Lyme may have joint pain and swelling, too. They may also have other symptoms like extreme fatigue, heart palpitations, headaches, etc. The list is l-o-n-g. Unfortunately the commonly used test (ELISA) is barely better than a coin toss and misses 43% of the cases. It should not be used as a screening test.<br>  <br>  You can find out more about Lyme disease at www.lymedisease.org. Click on Lyme 101.<br>  <br>  If you want to find a doctor who has some Lyme expertise, try the online dr search tool from LDA or your online state support group.

Answers?|`|NFOlMjasaa	The main Lyme Disease tests sometimes don't even SEARCH for the lyme band-31. The Western Blot and Elisa tests are HORRID for searching for Lyme, having both false negatives and positives. Make sure you haven't had one of those tests.<br>  <br>  You want a Lyme-literate doctor who tests with IgenX testing. It can be a little pricy, but it is much more accurate.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, do NOT take a steroid. That can mutate the disease and render it Chronic, and possibly, incurable. <br>  <br>  Some hints: Sugars, Caffeine, and Carbohydrates are bad for the disease and can cause the spirochetes to multiply rapidly.<br>  <br>  Try to get some Cat's Claw and/or Teasel Root Extract, if you cannot find a doctor to diagnose you. They are herbs that have been proven to work in some cases, but really a lot of antibiotics help a lot more SOMETIMES.

Because it is a brilliant cardio workout when used to full potential, it will help you trim down in general.<br>  <br>  YES YES YES there is absolutley a proper way to use a rowing machine. You will destroy your back if you do not have the correct technique! The best tips I've found are: google "concept rowing machines" and click on the first site. Scroll down to "c2 directory" ( or something like that) > training > technique. Have someone watch you and compare to the videos/ pictures.. You will appreciate it later when you are not in constant pain! And be sure to drive with your legs before sitting up a tiny bit- a) you'll avoid a messed up lower back, and b) you'll get über toned legs :)
AA11461005	Yes. When the STD isn't present it can still be found in your cells. When cells undergo cell division they can not tell the difference between their DNA and the viruses DNA. Because of this they duplicate with the viruses DNA.

The amount of insulin injected each day depends on what you eat/how much exercise you get daily/how you're body responds to it, basically insulin is the "key" to "unlock" the cells in your body so that glucose can enter the cell and be used for energy, no diabetes doesn't hurt, no its not contagious.|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	wow your dumb...

It is an autoimmune disorder.  There is nothing you can eat that will give you type 1 diabetes.  Insulin must be injected or given through a pump.  It is a hormone that your pancreas produces, but a person with diabetes pancreas does not produce it any more.  It does not hurt, but taking shots and testing  your sugar can sting a bit.  It is not contagious.

Usually they fade in time, but don't disappear.<br>  <br>  I am unfortunate to have them on my bust, it sucks because I have to watch what types of shirts I wear.  I have them on my hips as well.  It is hard, but not impossible to find a bathing suit to hide it, or get the matching cover ups.  I don't know why I have them because I was never really big, but I guess I had a fast growth spurt?  I have had them probably since 4th or 5th grade, I'm 24 now.  I suppose I have thin skin.
Hv91Jcn5aa	lol the story is nice and yeah its normal especially if your diet isn't healthy.  Umm if you run every day or so a month should get you back into shape and other training depends how hard you do it but since your so out don't start with anything crazy.<br>  Make sure you eat well (and with enough time so it can digest) before you run so that you can have good energy. i say every day running unless a super hard day then you need like a day off.
fKH7fVHPaa	nah i dont think so, maybe you should start eating fruit aswell it will benefit you more probably :) and you sound like a nice weight.|`|YqQ2SFDcaa	Well if you exercise everyday it would not be a problem.|`|defeBgqdaa	probably not|`|iD5tvndxaa	your skinny girl eat more 10 stone more to grab|`|b3jaOwj9aa	lol your stupid.<br>  the daily intake is 2000.<br>  do the math.|`|C5QV222iaa	if you only eat 800-900 calories a day you should lose weight.
CuVnpxh3aa	You fainted because you had no oxygen going to your brain and it caused you to pass out. It is kinda dumb to do that, you are depriving your brain of oxygen and we don't know what that may cause in the long run. I wouldn't do it anymore.|`|vp8806Eraa	It's not going to kill you, but everytime you do that it kills some braincells, so no it's not great. Do it all the time and you might get some complications.<br>  <br>  <br>  But it's probably better than sniffing glue I guess.<br>  <br>  You should probably just play sports instead|`|qoBlB9nVaa	its certainly not good. why would you do that?|`|i4NkPeATaa	When you do that you compress your arteries that supply blood to your brain. That decrease is enough to make you faint. When you faint blood flow is restored and you wake up in a few seconds. <br>  <br>  I don't see how doing that alone could be bad for you but when you faint you could fall and get hurt that way. You should probably not do that.

AA10358331	Honestly, If you have to ask if you've had your period then you probably haven't had it. You would notice blood everywhere for 3-7 days. <br>  Its not always dark and gooey. After the "old" blood is gone (the darker blood) the blood will turn a more natural red color and its not sticky, its like blood, runny with pieces of the uterus lining. <br>  <br>  I don't think that you've had your period yet.|`|QJHE3z1raa	your freaking 15 and don't know?<br>  its gonna be irregular and it was prolly spotting which means its will start soon.<br>  <br>  stressing about your period like this WILL delay so chill|`|5RoYyprkaa	When you're just starting to have a period, it's not common for it to be irregular for a while. It took me several years before mine came  pretty regular. Sometimes I went 4 months without a period, sometimes I went 2 weeks, sometimes 8 months.<br>  <br>  Tell your mom, and I'm sure she'll tell you hers was irregular too when she first started.|`|yXiH06qSaa	that can happen.  my first period was also dark; you are lucky.  some girls will get there first period and keep getting each month and some will get it again several months later.  also some periods are irregular when you are young.  may get it twice a month or barely at all one month.<br>  <br>  no worries!!|`|EhJlgKLAaa	my first period was also dark and gross. i had mine once and then didn't have it for 6 months
omegLbOAaa	1) find an activity that you like to do. I hate running. HATE it. And swimming bores me. But I like kickboxing & dancing of any sort & yoga makes me feel great, too.     2) join an exercise class. if you have to be there at a certain time, then you're more likely to show up, do your hour & go home. Without a schedule, you're more tempted to put it off & put it off until it's finally too late.    3) find a partner to exercise with you. then you can motivate each other & keep each other on task.    4) join a gym. Once you paid your $$, you might as well go & not waste it.    5) don't give in to excuses. "i'm too tired" isn't good enough. Even if you do only 10-20 minutes, you're at least doing something. Usually I find that once I start exercising that I'm able to do a full workout. "i don't have time" isn't good enough. If you can find time to watch 3 hours of TV per day, you can use one of those to exercise.|`|0MUwB3Czaa	Take it slow at first.  You do too much too fast and you get burned out and quit.  Just because someone can run 5 miles does not mean you are ready to do the same.  Go at your own pace.  Living healthy is a lifestyle change not just something you try for a little while.  If you are really at a loss get a personal trainer to help you start out.

04d06dfa9bbbb62672382e390353acbfaa	It's really good that you like fruits and vegetables, because a diet with lots of fruits and vegetables will keep you full and not starving. You should try going to the library and getting a cookbook on vegetarian or vegan cooking-- they won't include seafood or cheese, and most recipes are pretty simple. A simple vegetable stir-fry and some rice is a good dinner that's easy to make. You just make some brown rice (which comes in a box) and chop up and saut whatever vegetables you have on hand (peppers, mushrooms, onions, etc.) Cook with a little oil and soy sauce... delicious!    Also, since your doctor said you should lose a little weight, the doctor should be able to make a recommendation on a diet plan, or refer you to a dietitian, who can work with you to come up with a plan that works.|`|CHSIzFq9aa	eat all the bologna and salami you can.|`|T6w4bXiuaa	1. drink a lot of water.  2. take time to chew when you chew  3. do some regular daily exercise ( i don't mean like running, but do some scratchings everyday; it will shape your body as well)  4. don't try to fast (eat regularly but try not to eat too much)  5. relax when you eat something (don't be stressed )   6. always drink a cup of water before you eat breakfast.  7. eat breakfast everyday; it helps dieting. (your body needs some fuels to get your metabolism going and give you energy for the rest of the day.  8. eat regular meals.  9. try to avoid the food after 6 P.M.    So, good luck! I hope it will help...     I'm not sure about the cooking site.  Just try to avoid to sweat, oily, and salty food!!!

vk6oLlJDaa	stacey, there are a lot of things that can be causing this frequent urinating you have. one really big thing is stress, another is medication that you may be taking whether prescribed or otc can contribute, yeast infections are very common and can also be a cause. but there is one really big and i mean big thing that can cause urinary problems and that is PANTIE SHIELDS. please, if you do wear pantie shields on a daily basis, please stop now, today. i am telling you this from experience. i have had chronic urinary and bladder infections my whole life and been on and off antibiotics. my gyno explained that keeping the area bound up with underpants, pantie shields, pantyhose and outer pants was a breeding ground for bacteria and bacterial infections, he also advised cotton panties should be worn on a daily basis.i took his orders very seriously and i have recovered. now you try. good luck and keep me posted. i bet you will get better quickly|`|TLiyAuCTaa	peeing a lot is a symptom for diabetes, especially if you wake up to pee at night. you should take a blood test.|`|eDRk230Uaa	that happened to me too just don't drink a lot of water and eat more like food healtly what ever just do not drink al lot hope it works and hope you give me 10oints|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Its prob just because your drinking so much water.|`|YyiESOpFaa	water cleans out your system.....it's normal to pee that much in a day if you drink a lot of water.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	how much water?<br>  <br>  if you dont eat  and only drink water  this may be the reason?|`|qusKbEmBaa	You should continue drinking water and continue to see a<br>  doctor for more information.|`|bSChe6Tgaa	Your fine. Urinating this many times I don't think is that big of a deal. You must be drinking a lot of water. If you drink it slowly it filters through your kidneys better. Plus your flushing your body out so I think it is a good thing. If they say nothing is wrong with you no infection or anything then don't worry about it.|`|CuVnpxh3aa	Cut back on the water and you won't have to pee so much. Eat some food that is non fattening if you are drinking so much water to lose weight and exercise. Water is good for you but don't go overboard and you won't need the bathroom so often. Don't worry about diabetes, it's just too much water.|`|4CMx1uzXaa	If you only drink water, then that would explain your (not so) problem.|`|xOX7yMczaa	yah what he said. cut down on the water, woman! :) splurge a little

H6uYThgjaa	a doctor can prescribe you stronger antiperspirants. otherwise, botox injections will temporarily help, but this is expensive.|`|GsSRY7quaa	check with your doctor, there are meds/other items for excessive sweating.|`|ETa77Necaa	I'm a mother of a 20 year old girl and a 19 year old son, none of them sweat like this.  You seem awfully young to have such a problem.  But since you are sweating, I assume you've hit puberty, or hit it a while ago.  I don't believe it's possible to sweat before then.  But like I said, being a mother, I remember their doctors stating that sweating starts at puberty, luckily:) (like everything else), but anything in EXCESS is not a good thing.  Have you gone to the doctor?  ARE YOU OVER WEIGHT?  My brother in law sweats all the time and actually carries a towel on his shoulder because of this problem.  He does sweat due to his weight problem.  You didn't mention anything about your weight, so it's only something I can tell you can happen if that is the case.  I still would feel better if you were my 13-year old taking you to a doctor.  Sweating can mean lots of things honey, so don't ignore this.  Tell your parents.|`|W3bELVbmaa	So sorry to hear you sweat so much hun, but you should remember your age. You are only 13, and when I was 13, I sweat quite a lot. It's normal, but if it smells, and if there really is a fair bit of it, then perhaps a visit to your family doctor would be a good idea? Just to see whats wrong. There is a conditon Hyperhidrosis which causes pores to release more sweat than average - sadly, there is no cure, and it is highly unlikely that's what it is, but you should go just to make sure. I really dont want to scare you, as I'm one of those people who assumes the worst and I don't know if you are, but please don't worry that you have Hyperhidrosis (you most likely do not, hun).<br>  <br>  Make sure you tell your mum or dad, or someone who can make an appointment for you :).<br>  Best of luck.<br>  <br>  x|`|VfTLMU5Caa	I know exactly what your talking about.

bNSxKBBRaa	Methicillin Resistant Staphylococci aureus is a bacteria that is resistant to methicillin, penicillin, amoxacillin, oxacillin;  drugs that would otherwise kill it but it has formed some form of survival method making it more difficult to treat.<br>   MRSA is especially troublesome in hospital-associated (nosocomial) infections.

914lxjtJaa	your shins have no fat on them period so there is nothing you can do about that. If you mean your calves however you can try low resistance cardio excercise like a stationary bike as this will help you burn fat but not cause your legs to get larger by building muscle. I did a simple 10miles in 30 minutes everyday for 6 weeks and lost over 50 pounds of body fat and a large portion of that fat came from my calves thighs and belly. I would recommend you either buy a gym membership or a stationary bike and get to it the results come faster the more you do.

LHzlvfRQaa	If you are thinking like this, please talk to your doctor, or phone a Youth help line, so they can advise you where to go for help so you can talk about whats making you think like this.  Suicide is anger turned inwards. You need to learn positive ways of dealing with problems, by writing a poem to express what you are feeling on paper. Or write down what it is about your life, that you don't like, then work on changing whatever it is.  You need to read some books on how to raise your self-esteem and personal growth. Also books on positive thinking. Everytime you get a negative thought, like the one in your question, replace it with a positive thought, such as,' I am a good person and I deserve to be happy'. Ask yourself what it is you want in life, not what other people want, then learn to say 'no' to people. Communication is the answer. You need to tell people that what they have said has hurt you, when they have hurt you. You need to tell people that they are not listening to what you are saying, and that what they like, mightn't be what you like. If you try to live up to other peoples expections, you will never be happy, because there is always going to be someone who will criticise you.    Take control of your life and start to believe in yourself. Think positive, and don't use food as a vehicle for anger. If you starve yourself you are at risk of having a heart attack, or stroke, and you mightn't die. You could end up paralysed, in pain, and alive, without the choice of ever being able to make your own choices about what you want to do with your life.  Get outside and go somewhere new, get on a bus or train, stay in a backpackers and meet some new and interesting people. Take up and learn a new hobby, such as photography, or art, or writing, something where you can express yourself positively. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Enjoy!|`|AA11388527	I figure you mean anorexia nervosa and not just simple anorexia.   With no food but with water intake and minimal activity, it could 3 or more months.

You have to be moving at a pretty brisk clip to make a 16 minute mile, especially if you've under about 5'8" (this is where stride length comes in).

d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	No, it does not work. Your metabolism slows down cosiderably while you sleep so even if you slept for a few weeks in a row, you wouldn't lose much weight at all.<br>  <br>    Just look at animals like bears that hibernated- it doesn't work for them so it won't work for you!|`|jA2VJXzFaa	yea what is it|`|n7BuH75gaa	you sleep all the time and lose weight?<br>  I don't think so.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	Haa!!  I sleep alot but I am still chunky.  It might work for some.  If you are tired  throughout the day, your body wants you to eat for energy.  I know when I am tired I crave sugary foods.  This is my body looking for energy I think.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	If it's a diet that has to do with not eating healthy and not exercising, then no.<br>  You have to be active to lose weight, genius.  You can't just find an 'easy miracle' cure to losing weight.|`|Hf94X5Wvaa	If it involves the word diet, but doesn't regard a balanced meal of all the food groups coupled with good exercise, then no it will not work.|`|hMF3kg3Baa	Never heard of it here is more information on it.|`|ep3dqXrpaa	What is the sleeping diet?
USoqyjaAaa	You should see a doctor for a diagnosis.  Assuming you and your sister were vaccinated, rubella infection is unlikely.  Your sister should already know if she is immune because they routinely check rubella titers early in pregnancy.  Congenital rubella occurs in 90% of infants infected in the first trimester.  After the 20th week, defects are rare. <br>  <br>  If you do indeed have rubella it is a disease reportable to the health department.  You would need to be excluded from school and work and isolated from others who might be susceptible, including the baby.  You need to see a doctor immediately so that you can get tested.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Your symptoms could be many illnesses.  If you have had your baby shots, your chances are slim that you have Rubella.  It is not impossible but a rare occurrence.  A simple blood test would be able to tell whether you have this or not and then, if you don't, you should be able to enjoy the birth and the new baby as soon as you are well  I would not take any chances of passing something onto the baby and would stay away until completely well..|`|BYfmKhVwaa	go to the doctor and take a blood test
AA11662490	Pain in your upper body could be from the throwing up but never take anything for granted if your chest is hurting seek medical attention. better safe than dead. Heart problems is associated with bulimia
6wsGQ1NCaa	Those are defiantly symptoms. The eating alot but not gaining (actually loosing) is like a dead give away. <br>  I have type one diabetes and im 13 and feel free to email me if you have questions. kewlteddibear17@aim.com<br>  also if you do have diabetes i highly recommend to mini med insulin pump.|`|NBuFZd5Aaa	you are just probably stress out. Type 1 does not occure in older people. type 1 only exsit in infants/children. You might have type 2. See your doctor and tell them your symptoms they'll do a glucose test to confirm. good luck|`|3Ophdo9raa	Type 1 is juvenile diabetes so you're probably right. It's not the end of the world. I was recently diagnosed myself. Fortunately I'm just on the pills. Exercise and eating right (mostly veggies) will keep your glucose under control. Good luck and take care.|`|ZXXr6xz8aa	This really isn't an answer to ur question at all but, i have been experiencing the same kinds of symptoms and am going into the doctors today and am totally freaked out about it. I'm only 18. I don't think ur being paranoid or overdramatic at all.|`|wDRyxp5vaa	If you're getting the blood test results back tomorrow, there is not much you can do right now.<br>  <br>  But since you are drinking a lot, peeing a lot and showing other symptoms, you may have Diabetic Ketoacidosis.  Most new diagnosed type ones have this (I did,too- with a blood sugar of 600+, normal is 80-120).  <br>  <br>  If you start vomiting, feeling weak, faint or anything really out of ordinary, go to the hospital.  Sometimes, if your blood sugar is that high, you could faint, have a seizure or go into a diabetic coma.  But don't get worried- this is only if your blood sugar is really high.<br>  <br>  It wasn't that bad being diagnosed.  The three days in the hospital because of my ketoacidosis wasn't really terrible.  If you have it, you'll learn a lot!  Good luck and keep us posted!
Q4ggnG0waa	Hmm, strange. I've had LESS hiccup episodes since being on my chemo and radiation. Never heard of those treatments causing hiccups. They're a spasm of the diaphram, which I guess, unless you're getting radiation in that general area, should have no bearing on the matter.|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	I'm sorry, I don't know what causes hiccups but I do know that my sister had hiccups the whole time she went through cancer treatments and she said they were very very painful. Your doctor should be able to tell what causes it. Good luck with your treatment, god bless|`|RX11FhWKaa	Check if you are taking some type of steroid. Perhaps, dexamethasone or something. Often times the oncologists give steroids during treatments to ease the fatigue that chemotherapy can cause. Steroids do have a habit of causing hiccups, sometimes excessively and painfully. <br>  I can only say that you have to just learn how to sense when and what triggers the hiccups and try and prevent them. I had the hiccups for 6 hours during chemotherapy at one point. It drives you insane. But ask your doctor if you are on some steroids and maybe you can try a different type.
CXwjdUgDaa	if you want to bulk up start lifting weights and try protein bars.<br>  you can get them at any local gas station or grocery store<br>  then who will be doing the teasing when u get all the girls?<br>  haha good luck!|`|KWwW7N49aa	Don't worry, I was like you when I was young and I was made fun of too.  The would say I was as skinny as a stick of macaroni. Just be yourself and like yourself.  As long as you are healthy, that is what is important.  Although it took me a while to pick up weight, I eventually did.  All the girls that had nice figures are fat and out of shape now and I am still trim.  It is a blessing, embrace it.<br>  Oh and I tried this quack pill called Weight On and tried drinking lots of milk shakes and stuff but I still didn't gain.  Don't bother with any of those pills.  What a croc.|`|rxScdXM4aa	i know how you feel..it used to happen to me. i don't know how old you are but as you mature you will get fuller and curvier. eat a healthy diet and enjoy life!|`|0dq3rc04aa	I used to be this way too. There is not much to do about it but to accept that your body mechanism is burning more calories than some others. If you don't have any eating disorders then you know there is nothing to be ashamed of. Just enjoy life!<br>  <br>  By the way some of those teasing you now will get older, have kids (as you probably will too!) and some of them will gain weight they can't get rid of... and they will envy your shape later on<br>  <br>  It's just a rough patch you'll get by... I have! and while some people around me obsess on loosing weight or counting calories, i can still eat without packing pounds!|`|G5Huk19Xaa	dont take medicine, just work out. its that simple. and some people are skinnier than others naturally, but working out is the answer, not taking tablets or something. eat healthy and work out.|`|nzxwvZx0aa	Learn to spell and use proper English; maybe that will help.
2ISGwSK7aa	You have to remember the heart is a muscle and works like other muscles. If it is strained, cramping, etc. it may send pain signals through his body. He should check with his doc.|`|6Kq1ExFxaa	Yahoo Answers can't diagnose something as vague as that, go to a doctor with him tomorrow morning.|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Or Maybe Is Broken ?|`|zOIgzIy4aa	high blood pressure can do it and if he,s really fat then the fat is too much around his heart. he better get that weight down or he will have a stroke or heart attack. if he loses weight then he will be able to breathe better and the blood pressure will come down.
U9n960GYaa	I doubt if you'll get many accurate answers here in the Diabetes forum... You may want to repost the question in the "pets" forum...<br>  <br>  But, I don't know if that grape hurt her or not but if she acts like that, I wouldn't give her any more...<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK !!!|`|BG8vMyZjaa	From the site below, the grape will not harm your chinchilla.<br>  <br>  "Fruit, try fruits with seeds, not stones or pits, e.g. raisins, dried cranberries, dried blueberries, dried rose hips, a banana chip, or a piece of apple, pear, grape, or kiwi. My chins also like dried strawberries and dried pineapple".|`|2eee3d9288232f099e9b265f904ce90aaa	I know that grapes are poisonous to dogs -- I don't know about chincillas. You should take her to see a vet, I know vets are expensive, but she shouldn't suffer either.
AeydP3Z4aa	My boyfriend also has an armpit fetish. Don't worry about, just let him do whatever he wants. I saw a doctor about it, he assured me it was completely normal.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	Anything he's into and you're comfortable is fine. If it doesn't bother you then it can't hurt...and you don't have to tell people. Just keep it between you two. ?|`|XsmPnMU4aa	It is very normal. I find Armpits very sexy. All men love Armpits. Let him have his fun.|`|xhDdYnHTaa	I'd say yes it's pretty normal.  The armpit can be appealing and very sensual.  My boyfriend is fanatical about tickling my armpits, though I think it has more to do with his love of tickling me than of armpits.|`|ePZN6RG3aa	Alot of men would have the same fetish, it's normal. Just make sure your okay with him doing what he's doing or you could limit him to only going so far. But nothing to worry about, totally normal.|`|826a85d5cffb6532b3bf8f657b3a42e9aa	Yeah!! It is perfectly normal and according to some researches the odour of armpits turn men on.<br>  What else you need????|`|dy9C5kYkaa	yes, he is totally alright. Many boys have this type of habit. don't worry about this.|`|HDgyRIh4aa	The spectrum of "normal" encompasses almost everything.  It isn't that it's normal or abnormal, it's just him.  I wouldn't, however, say "just let him do whatever he wants,"  but instead let him do whatever you're comfortable with.  <br>  <br>  Just openly discuss it with him and don't be embarrassed to do so. If you aren't comfortable with some of the things he wants to do, let him know and try to come to a compromise. And as the other user said, you don't have to tell anyone, and it's no one else's business.|`|Pe0gITtiaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaa...<br>  let him screw your armpit.
sfYn9GFZaa	abnormal cell groth can accure anywhere dont take the hpv shot you can solve this problem yourself with the help of diet in two weeks you canbe healthy with no worry. watch such films as :a world without cancer or mariical mineral suplements. Sorry you already been coaxed into surgery. Dont listen to them you are money to them. Listen to the masses, learn read more about baking soda and cancer. you can stop some of these things with about 1 or two bucks. You dont have to risk not having children or other complications to be sound.|`|AA11878029	abnormal means cancer cells are to high.....I am getting an endometrial biopsy because of this !!!|`|mH4cQvOMaa	my pappy is normal
S3fELOJwaa	Sounds to me like you have an injury similar to someone else I know and they found it to be a Sacroiliac Dysfunction.  They were recommended get a Sacroiliac Belt from a company named Serola which was something at that time I had never heard of.  My buddy told me it helped the pain a lot and wearing it after a chiropractic adjustment helped the pain completely go away.  I looked up the website for you if you want to read about it, I read it and bought one of the belts after I experienced some back pain and it has helped me as well.  Here is the link <a href="http://www.serola.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.serola.net/</a>  I hope this helps you

TfbTYc2Laa	You should not give up your antibiotic treatment even if it does not help at all. This is because some microorganisms in your body may gain resistance to antibiotics if you do not take the full dose. <br>  <br>  It is best to fast on fruits, fruit juices, fruit-vegetable juice mixes and honey during a sinus infection.

AA11967904	I took creatine and man I'm telling you I had the runs real bad luckly I never left my place.  Real funny Stratdax for us some people I had to find out the hard way, to bad there isn't a warning. Since were on this topic, does creatine work and does the side effects wear off. Should I ever take a chance going back on creatine, with the fear of the runs and I don't mean jogging.|`|gERaZGZeaa	"I took creatine and man I'm telling you I had the runs real bad luckly I never left my place."    haha yeah, it does that to some people.|`|945gMsSZaa	Think of taking creatine as filling a bowl.  You fill the bowl in your loading phase and then as you deplete it daily by small amounts, you top it up.      If you add in more now, it can only be used by your body if there is room in your bowl.  So taking excess when your body has been supplied with it for three weeks will probably not yield any benefits.    Your best bet would be to see this phase until the end and start afresh with a new loading phase.|`|7pkxOc6Raa	Why would it be harmful...honestly, what the hell is with people thinking creatine it's dangerous. It's a ******* mineral present in red meat that leads to volumization of muscles, extra ATP, less soreness, and increased protein synthesis.    Loading up is pointless. Just take it normally. And you don't really need to cycle it either.
xKYXurpNaa	Sounds good but without knowing any more information this means nothing.    You need to take your body fat percentage to know whether that's a good weight or not.

As for the issue of the pill causing weight gain, yes, it is true that it can but that weight gain is mostly water due to the hormones in the medication.    I am including the link to a site that might help you find more information.  The link is at: http://forums.obgyn.net/womens-health

JiATH6rGaa	It varies and depends on genetics, your diet, and your environment. But normally it'll start to slow down in your twenties or basically probably a few years after your growth spurt.    Do yourself a favor. Recognize your fast metabolism as a blessing. Don't try to gain weight in an unhealthy way. Eat healthy. Make sure you're getting enough protein and complex carbs. And weight train. Focus on weight training whatever parts of your body that you'd like to fill better. You're a women. You don't produce enough testosterone to get 'gross' or bulky like a man and you could be impressed with how much better you feel. You'll be working on increasing a long safer life.     :)     Good luck!|`|vJIZkbRdaa	eat chocolate|`|gH7wqHrdaa	It is feasible to lose weight rapidly but you should be realistic and comprehend that if you lose weight quickly then you will probably put it all back on again just as quickly.

If your above 16 I think that dieting tablets are good, as you can buy them over the counter at any health food store e.g. Holland & Barret.    However if you are under 16 and you think yourself large you might just have a slow metabolism therefore I would suggest that you go for a 20 minute jog every other day and don't snack through out the day, just have three normal meals. Maybe choose friday or a random day for junk food.    You could also try the special K diet (if you don't have special K just use Bran or muesli). All you have to do is eat special K for breakfast and lunch (have a normal dinner) for two weeks and you should loose a few pounds.

QYvM7Lrjaa	Heya,    You can try out these 3:    Basic Crunch  Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your hands lightly behind your head for support. Using your abdominal muscles lift your shoulders a few inches off the ground, pause briefly and return to start position. Complete at least one set of 10-12 reps.    Standing Towel Circle  Stand tall and hold a small towel (or resistance band) taut overhead. Contract abs and slowly draw a large, wide circle over your head and around your torso with your hands. Keep towel pulled taut throughout. Return to beginning position and reverse the circular direction. Complete at least one set of 8-10 reps in each direction.    Oblique Twist With Ball  Begin by sitting on the ball. Walk feet forward until ball is resting under your back -- body is now parallel to the floor. Place hands lightly behind head for support. Using your abdominal muscles slowly crunch up lifting your shoulder blades off of the ball and rotate left shoulder toward right hip. Return to starting parallel position and repeat then switch sides.      Good luck!
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|UdigyHvBaa	like don't feel bad and don't let people get you down.  i used to have trouble with my weight but the way i did it was dangerous i was anorexia and soon after i became bulimiai was just about put in the hospital so just be yourself if they don't like the way you look the don't have to look your way.

ajBtWJiMaa	You're probably waiting too long to eat and your blood sugar level is dropping down too low, then you eat and it jacks up your blood sugar and makes you feel shaky. Are you having lots of carbs when you do eat? Try eating smaller meals throughout the day, having healthy snacks etc so you're not starving when it's time to eat. Maintain a healthy blood sugar level so that you don't get the highs and crashes. You should probably see your doc and get your sugar checked also.|`|Lt8Fg5Ekaa	I am not a doctor, and you might or might not need to see a doctor about this.    I suspect that you have problems with blood sugar (glucose) control.  You might have diabetes and you might consider getting a blood sugar test to find out.  If you know a diabetic who tests their blood sugar, maybe they could test yours?      Diabetes can cause shaking if you have too little sugar.  (I can't seem to find any links about high blood sugar causing shaking, but I thought that I read that it could).  The most common cause of diabetic shaking is low blood sugar.|`|7S5EgDFVaa	Yeah, it should.  What do you mean by shaky?

Light activity helps eliminate soreness by increasing blood flow, removing waste products, etc.  If you were lifting heavy weights, you should take time off, but if it was something easy like pushups, you'd be fine to repeat that workout.  You wouldn't to go everyday forever though.|`|yMRY5cgxaa	Your muscles tear from workouts They need time to heal so it is best to work one set of muscles one day and others the next or skip a day between workouts if you are doing an all body workout.|`|PBIVKpi6aa	If you're just starting out, yes, you should wait a day or two. Back in my cross-country days, we did strength workouts (upper body only, as the lower half got plenty of exercise!) only three days a week, as we certainly didn't need the extra bulk. Either way, if you're just weight lifting, it's pretty useless if you're not doing any cardio, don't forget to do both, and save the weights for after your cardio, to decrease the chances of tearing or otherwise injuring muscles!
VnLaUS3Jaa	of course.     to bulk up, you want to choose a weight that is difficult (an 8 or 9 on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the most difficult)    once you have chosen your weight, do 3-6 repetitions for 4-6 sets.    increase your workload by adding reps, sets and/or weight each session.    remember to work your major muscle groups (chest, back, shoulders, core and legs) before focusing on the smaller muscles like the arms.    when you do chest (push exercises) you are automatically working your triceps.    when you do back (pull exercises) you are automatically working your biceps.|`|j6SUkE4Raa	lifting weights tears your muscle, meaning new ones will add on to old, but give a day in between, but to increase muscle mass, the increase in reps or weight is needed!|`|WrDGhduxaa	If you don't change the load or increase the weight you will not increase the size of the muscles.  Doing more reps will give you more strength, but not more size.  Increasing the weight will increase the size of the muscles.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	then you wont get any bigger... its called adaption.  the body will only get bigger if the load increases.|`|gfksposqaa	Technicality - you can't put on muscle, the number of muscle fibers you are born with is all you'll ever have, but you can make the muscle fibers thicker, hence the tiny tears that fill in and make your muscles bigger.    Anyway, back to your question, yeah, you have to increase the weight or your body just adapts.  Otherwise you could get huge doing 1000 push-ups.  Ain't happening, got to go heavy or go home.
uUCH3hJRaa	it's not bad, i would replace the cake with something like a snackwell brownie or better yet a bran muffin.  I would go with something healthier than the scone.

If your distance vision is always blurred, before AND after looking up close, then I would be inclined to say that you're nearsighted. In either case, you may need glasses. Have your eyes examined to be certain.|`|nuFYOoguaa	wow..  dont ask yahoo ask the eye doc!|`|IAfj3bDMaa	I definitely think you do.    BUT!

This is definitely your choice to believe whatever you wish to;  I would visit the forums at iBlindness.org  --  and the overall site.  It's called the Bates method, used to restore vision. These are NOT eye exercises!!    Or if you would rather do something less harsh, do whatever is necessary to not strain your eyes. If glasses mean squinting less, so be it. I could also recommend getting a pair of pinhole glasses, but those don't ever look very great.

You sound like you don't want a relationship with him (though I may have read it wrong), if you want to pursue the relationship, go for it, only you know him.  If you don't, then cut off contact and tell him it's over & he needs to get used to it.
0SEYMBKDaa	If you are late with a pill it can upset your normal hormonal cycle and cause these effects. Nothing to worry about. If you've been taking them exactly on time, nothing to worry about either, just talk to your doctor about switching pills to a higher or lower dose.

I've never done it ever since I've been with him (madly in love) but yeah when I was single I thought about how it would be to be close to someone. I think it's just a way your mind makes up for something you don't have. You don't have a partnership you would like so you try filling in that gap with daydreams. You'll still do it with your soulmate except you can actually live it out one day. There is nothing wrong with it.|`|i2yM0T9Paa	Its just your hormones.

MS5OBY9Waa	Relax, maybe try a different absorbancy of tampon.|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	Try using the smallest ones available, some come in "slenders" but usually the smallest ones are the "lights". Buy the ones with the plastic applicator.  Next, relax. Your muscles get tense when you are nervous and it will be more difficult.  Here is a site for more information: http://www.beinggirl.ca/en_CA/pages/arti...  Good luck! :]|`|7swefA6Paa	the first couple times may hurt, you may've broken your hymen, dont worry it'll get better i used to hate them too but then you stop noticing them alltogether and its so much better than feeling like youre wearing a diaper|`|xZMoaqRSaa	umm they use to hurt me to put one leg on the toilet and insert it this way ur puttin it in on the correct angle so it wont hurt as much make sure u put it in all the way so ur fingers should touch before u pull the applicator out hope it helps|`|MsSHhX8zaa	Maybe you're using a tampon with too high of an absorbency. Try starting out with a "teen" or "regular" absorbency tampon and wearing a pantyliner just in case the absorbency isn't high enough and you leak out a little bit. Once you get used to putting a tampon and in get used to the feeling of a tampon, you can try higher absorbencies if you need to.    I've found that tampons with plastic applicators are easier to put in. They are shaped a little bit differently and the plastic slides in easier. Also, maybe it hurts because you're putting it in wrong. In every box of tampons there should be a little piece of paper that shows you how to put one in. if that doesn't help, try standing with one leg up on the side of the bathtub and insert the tampon at an angle.|`|W0jhffBfaa	first of all make sure that u are using the right size (try a smaller size1) and make sure that ur puttign them in the right way!|`|hwah87m8aa	try fingering yourself first so your lubricated|`|LBwkckvkaa	you may be putting it in wrong.|`|7mB2Hkj0aa	relax and put it in at an angle it doesnt go straight up or in|`|D9zGSIvwaa	Relax before putting it in.

Also try using thinner and more compact tampons. I think Playtex Gentle Glide, and another one from Playtex (I think it was slim fit or something with slim), also Playtex Sport! These are very good. Since you say it hurts, I advise you not to use cardboard application. Those are harder. Playtex makes many plastic applicator ones which you don't even feel. Try those. I hope I helped.|`|KeHC9hjlaa	First of all, get the right brand and size for you. I found that to begin with, the applicator varieties were best as these help to position it correctly. Go for ones with a plastic applicator or a cardboard one with lubrication (you could just buy some lube and smear some on the tampon)  As for putting them in, make sure you read and know the instructions. Make sure you attempt it when your flow is at its heaviest as this provides natural lubrication. You'll need to relax. Your vaginal muscles are relaxed if they feel like you've just completely emptied your bladder. Find a comfy position and go for it. Dont worry about the outcome or tense up worrying about the potential pain.  Dont worry if it takes a few attempts either but always remember to follow those instructions exactly. They're for your comfort and health
al0cCPb6aa	It's not something to really give tips for...it's a state of mind...a lifestyle change...it takes complete and total control and complete and total dedication.

tG0swCe6aa	Most of it is a scam.  Yes, acai is said to work.  Don't order it online if its a free trial.  They start charging your card.  If you buy it from a local retailer, go for it.|`|ZXDIKTiXaa	Yes I lost weight with the acai berry supplements. It really worked for me. A bit of technical info for you - excuse me if you already know all this.  The acai berry is the fruit of the acai palm tree, which grow in central and South American rainforests from Belize to Brazil.   The fruit is a small round purple berry similar in size to a grape. The acai berry is a superfood which simply means that it is so naturally packed with goodness that it may help to boost levels of health and vitality naturally. Up to now, one of the most commonly known superfoods is the blueberry. Known for it's abundance of natural antioxidants, many blueberry based health products are available. Other superfoods include garlic, onions, and leeks to name a few. This group of vegetables contain flavonoids that stimulate the production of antioxidants in the liver. This aids the elimination of toxins and carcinogens. The list also includes barley beans and lentils, green foods, hot peppers, nuts and seeds, sprouts, yogurts.   Without going into too much technical stuff the acai berry contains high levels of antioxidants, omega fats, high fibre, amino acids and plant sterols and also loads of vitamins and minerals  The important thing to note, is that it is a balanced diet containing all of these food groups that offers you the chances of best health. A healthy diet, combined with gentle exercise, meditation, yoga etc and you are more likely to enjoy the benefits of a healthier long life at a weight you are comfortable with.   So there you go this little berry is one powerful superfood.  But where do you get the acai? It only grows in the Amazonian forests of Brazil, so it is impossible to enjoy 'fresh' which would be the best way. (unless you happen to live there.)  Well the one I have tried and which worked for me is the one which you will find in the link below in the source box. This product also contains green tea which is also well known to aid weight loss and promote good health.  I lost around 14 pounds in 6 weeks  of course you have to eat a sensible diet and exercise as much as possible but this little berry capsule really worked for me. You take one 20 minutes before breakfast and one 20 minutes before lunch.  With this offer you also get some cool free products  you can go online and join the weight management club which gives you loads of tips and you feel part of a group which helps motivate you to carry on with your programme. You also get a free ebook giving really good weight loss tips and a visualization audio cd, which kind of plays soothing music and gives suggestions a bit like hypnotherapy - but you know I found it really really helpful.  The link is below and all I can say is it worked for me!    I believe celebs like Oprah and Brad Pitt use acai too.    Sorry I believe you cannot get the free trial offer in uk but you can buy it and you will get 4 bottles for the usual price of 6 which is what I did after my free trial.  Hope this helped
0TIok1Jlaa	Ellipticals actually build more because of the motion and degree of effort you have to give in the legs. I also believe it tones more and is easier on the knees than treadmills. If you are running with a treadmill and you feel it getting hard, there is nothing wrong with slowing down to even a walk for the rest of the way. If you want the same amount of calories burned, just walk a little longer.|`|KAyVeRezaa	It really doesn't matter and actually you don't have to run for 30 straight minutes. If you decided to walk for a few minutes so that your body can get back to running, that's okay. Or even if you wanted to walk for 30 minutes, that's an effective workout, just as long as its more of a brisk walk while pumping your arms. Treadmills are good because you can run and get a high intensity workout, but really anything is good for losing weight as long as your doing it for about 30 minutes straight.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Better is subjective. Some people like to run, while others feel like as if the elliptical is easier on the joints and enjoy the option for the upper body movement. Overall the treadmill will burn a few more calories per use, but a lot of people rotate as to not get bored with either.    If you aren't feeling a burn on the elliptical then perhaps you aren't challenging yourself on it or doing a strenuous enough setting.
OgykRk8Vaa	You need to know about dental stuff even if you are an assistant. Your friend is sadly wrong, it won't hurt to go to school and learn a thing or two. Hehe.

MwvA8v17aa	hun, youre not fat. your 5'7 & 125 pounds? people weight that much who are 5'4.    if youre not happy with how you look and want to feel more in shape, the way to go is running. it takes a lot to actually get motivated, but i promise if you just put on sneakers and running shorts, once you start jogging for about 15 minutes a day, you will feel sooo much better afterwards.  you can also do crunches while contracting your stomach, it helps wtih metabolism/tones your abs    a fun way? Wi Fit! :)|`|XKYP0sGQaa	Well, the quickest and most effective way would be to fast ( starve )     Although, once you break a fast you unavoidably gain back some of the weight you have lost. Therefore, you would need to lose more then 10lbs. To guarantee that you ultimately have lost at least 10lbs I would recommend you aim to see a number at 15lbs less then your current weight on the scales. It is also important that when you resume to your normal eating habits, you do it gradually.    Anyway, now that I have answered your question, I am going to give you a bit of advice: Don't do it ! It is not healthy and could potentially have some very dangerous, life threatening side effects. For example, if you hit a plateau along the way you are going to have to extend your fast and will be putting yourself at risk of passing out, your organs shutting down, deficiency diseases, anemia and so the list goes on.    Instead, take the sensible approach and eat a healthy, well balanced diet and participate in regular exercise. Your B.M.I I believe is in the healthy weight range so theoretically you do not "need" to lose anything.     If you don't mind me asking, how old are you ?

EDXh0tk9aa	All hymens look different and are formed differently, it has some holes in it so when you have your period, the blood can come out. So no, if you put two fingers inside it doesn't mean your hymen is broken.  The hymen can disappear too with other physical activities..  .  I never bled, but the first time hurt a whole lot.  Even if your hymen is gone, the first few time (or more) may hurt or feel  uncomfortable as up until then the vagina has been an unused muscle.|`|CfXLUEn8aa	No if you can fit two fingers up there, it doesn't mean your hymen is broken. Everyone's vagina is a different size. And you can break your hymen doing normal things, like riding a bike.  And you don't always bleed after breaking your hymen. Normally girls do it when they are younger and never know about it.|`|ikzqudHTaa	I'm not sure exactly when my hymen broke because it didn't bleed. I'm pretty sure that it didn't break from a penis, because the first time I had sex was painless.|`|W8v86HYoaa	are you asking if you lose your virginity if your hymen breaks? If thats it, the answer is no.  I never found, nor broke my hymen. I think only certain girls get it.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Most girls/women already have openings in their hymen. The only proof of virginity is an imperforate hymenone that has no opening at alland that is quite rare (and it also keeps you from menstruating, so it has to be surgically opened in many cases).  If the hymen is not imperforate, there's no way to proof that a someone is or isn't a virgin.    The hymen is delicate and can be damaged easily.  Lots of sports, especially things like cycling or horseback riding, can put stress on it and gradually wear it away.  Some women hardly have any hymen to begin with.  It may or may not bleed when damaged.    In summary, the state of the hymen is widely misunderstood and ridiculously overrated.  It can't be used to prove or disprove virginity, and it's often only half-there to begin with.

JTjzZKUkaa	Well Alyson Stoner is still very young (she is 15) so she probably hasn't grown fully yet. Also she is tiny but she also dosen't seem to be very tall or very "developed" yet.

I think at your height and weight you're healthy and not fat, but if you think you would be more comfortable losing a few pounds, do it. Just do whatever makes you happy.|`|2uDN1SJeaa	I'm confused.  What does his weight have to do with your weight?|`|YRvVLqZ3aa	no? how tall are you??|`|sbCvAy11aa	no your just big boned or a little chunky im 5'7 and i weigh 120. love you body.|`|OL3jpq3Gaa	No, I think he should consider to lose weight.

bVLwH4jlaa	Because you were shooting. For goodness' sake wear phones! I was involved with the music and sound industry for years and believe me, I have less hearing damage than my relatives who were trying to be "rustic"; without protection when hunting. COVER YOUR EARS! They cannot regenerate like other parts of the body.|`|rpK7ZUKBaa	Sounds like it could be 'Tinnitus'.  I suffer from it myself, eventually to an extent you tend to train yourself to not hear it.  My consultant said it was because I was exposed to high volume of noise over a long period of time, obviously I am now paying the price for all the discos I went to and also having the radio blaring!  Good Luck|`|dSOnm08uaa	wear ear protection, otherwise this will happen in noisy environments like shooting|`|pEaR7iuxaa	i used to work in a night club and one day of tinnitus   and  would not work with out ear defenders   if you have that sort of reaction you should not shoot with out them again   not nice is it|`|f7f1dbd297b05e58dcc42220734cebb4aa	Could be tinnitus which I have myself from working for years in heavy excavators without any ear protection, which must be supplied nowadays. My friend was a armourer in the army testing small arms he also has tinnitus but pretty bad sometimes unable to get a good nights sleep. He has been away from the army for ten years or so and still has tinnitus Apparently there is no answer to getting rid of so we just have to put up with it I'm afraid. So the answer for you is to wear ear plugs all the time when you are shooting no matter how uncomfortable they are.Happy hunting.   I hope your tinnitus is not permanent some times I can ignore it but at night when all is quiet it's terrible.|`|AA10655535	Your ears ring normally. It's just that this time since you're not listening to such a loud noise...you are more sensitive to the ringing in your ears.|`|3a80a25db76852cdfe36f12bf54ce2b3aa	noise induced hearing loss you were shooting which is hard on the inner ear it will get better and go away over time|`|My7SgLfoaa	Most likely aliens have put something inside of you.|`|f6fCixDnaa	It is called tinnitus and caused for many reasons but since you said you were shooting, its definately from that. When your ears are subject to loud noises they can cause damage to the ears and ringing of the ears are symptoms of damage. Dont worry it happens to me when i go to clubs. It will be gone by tomorrow.
gERaZGZeaa	Your form is probably a bit off.  With dumbbell rows, for example, make sure you aren't going too heavy, which will recruit the shoulders.  Pull the dumbbells to your hips, not your chest.  You want to go heavy, but not TOO heavy.    Do deadlifts - they're a killer.      I really like barbell rows.  Pull the bar to your stomach, not your chest.    And always use proper form!
HT40UWwlaa	when you take creatine, apart from increasing muscle, it makes your body retain water hence the bloated look some people may get. so when you stop taking it your body will get rid of the retained water making you look slightly smaller. you wont loose muscle mass if you keep training just loose the water retention.|`|MK1JTuQaaa	If you do decide to use creatine, drink twice your current water intake.

If we were sitting and got stung by a bee you'd jump and swat at whatever bodypart it stung. So with your braces or bruise, you unconsciously press or move it around hopeing to relieve the pain. Sort of like an itch.
yDNv30Okaa	you need to tuck your tummy in to build stamina, balance and core muscles, it also improves posture, ab exercises will work, but you may find your tummy will bulge a little if you dont pull the muscles in, so remember to do it in future|`|hJuPsaSDaa	Targetted weight reduction is quite difficult, many would say impossible, however the sole thing that really delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a few free trials remaining, it was highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I worked off thrity pounds, it really does produce results!|`|X605sT7oaa	You dont technically have to tuck it in, but apparantly tucking it makes it flatter? Or makes it go inwards instead of outwards..    Something like that :] Some people prefer to have outward abs.  The exercises still worked dont worry :)|`|eiJOdPgxaa	To tighten and strengthen your core muscles.|`|ToztjpAsaa	It's probably to help you maintain a good posture - standing up straight, shoulders back, chest out, etc, not slouched and round-shouldered.|`|RyMNLddQaa	it concentrates the exercises on the core muscles which help keep your tummy flat.

VtqdeSQ8aa	1/2gram-1gram of protein per pound of body weight (goal weight) per day. Have some at every meal and eat 5-6 small meals/snacks a day.|`|8dlvGqi7aa	a lot|`|02XpQY7vaa	he should take1.5 to 2.00 grms times his weight in kg.|`|JvxrUEwAaa	Hei :)    He should have just about his own weight * 1,5 maybe. Like if you weigh 80 kg then you would need 120 g. of protein. But eating high protein foods won't neccesarily help your husband to gain muscle. I often think  this is overlooked, but the amount of calories also plays in. Just make sure he eats a tad more calories then he burn off during the day, then he'll be buff in no time if he maintains his training :) - he would then also gain weight, but when the body runs out of fuel(calories) it will start taring on the muscle departement before the fat deposits...
gE7CFNXuaa	Losing so much weight so fast is really unhealthy, but if you really want to...     Drink lots of water. Eat lots of raw foods, like uncooked vegetables and fruits. Eat lots of nuts. Take walks every day.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	You can't..  Maybe by liposuction.|`|O0U9KyqZaa	kiss me!!
Bof47P0Qaa	My aunt has had this for the past 6 months and struggled to get the medication. She really wasn't feeling well for the last couple of months before she started taking medication. She had the common symptoms such as a swollen gland and fatigue but also constipation and her leg was hurting as a result.   She started taking thyroxin once daily for 6 weeks like you are going to and it really really helped her!! She is like a changed person :) She then increased the dosage and although she isn't COMPLETELY better yet, i really think she is improving every day and i'm sure that she will be at full health soon.   I would take these pills if i were you, they worked amazingly for my aunt!|`|yl0CZsy2aa	i know soy and brocolli lower the thyroid, so if you eat alot of that, it may effect your medicine|`|EHrysQcCaa	You will likely lose weight and have more energy while on the drug.  Thyroxine is the hormone that you are lacking and is important in regulating your metabolism. Levothyroxine is a synthetic version of thyroxine.  If you take too much you will get shaky and possibly faint, That is why it is important to get the right dose.  Nothing i know will get your levels up naturally.   If you need a medication, this one is not a bad choice, it is something you body needs and should not give you any trouble if you are consistent with taking it|`|4hrAW2STaa	Take medication1 hour before eating breakfast. You might experience weight gain. If you are past 50 years old, you will possibly have a reduced sex drive
EKd3Yjt8aa	there is nothing wrong with being thin. you should never hate your body even if its not the way you want it to be.  i went through a similar problem when i was your age.  i tried everything to gain weight. i ate whenever i could get the chance and really fatty stuff too. but all it did was give me terrible acne.  when i was about 17 i started to thicken and develope nice curves.  my suggestion to you is that you should change your body... if you have always been underweight there is nothing wrong with that. just try and eat healthy and wear clothes that will make your thin body look good.  i dont think that you will be skinny forever. just try and eat as much as you want an be a kid|`|CZIQMIr0aa	Go to the doctors and ask to be referred to a nutritionalist as they should be able to give you healthy protein shakes - not the ones that have other sorts of rubbish in them! They can also set up a diet plan - which sounds silly because you don't want to diet but its to help you eat things that can help you gain weight without putting stress on your other organs by eating food clogged with fat!|`|lg2RfcrQaa	Your idea of "alot" could be completely different to someone else's. There was a BBC documentary on yesterday...or the day before, I can't really remember where they got a group of people (who like you said they ate loads and didn't put on weight). They were given a high calorie diet and told to do no exercise whatsoever. By the end of the first week they had ALL put on weight. There were only 2 people who had only put on something stupid like 1lb.   Maybe you could see you doctor and see if they can devise some sort of diet for you to follow to put on weight.|`|RaBONSU6aa	if you know that you eat properly and that your friends know that you do, you shouldnt listen to people saying that, they are proberly just trying to make themselves feel better for their insecurities.    try eating about 2500-3000 calories a day. fi you find this hard then try drinking drinks with high calorie amouts or have those silly 'meal bars' for a snack instead of a meal.    sorry if i couldnt help that much :/  xxx|`|l344RtC8aa	i'm 16, my friend is the same way people call her anerexic and all of that stuff, she eats SO much. just a fast matabolism as well. i think if she (and maybe you?) just got more physically active she would gain muscle and not be as thin. you would look thin but a muscly attractivee thin. if you are already active and run and everything then maybe its just the way your body is. dont put junk into just to gain weight (mcdonalds everyday kinda thing when i say junk) be happy with how you look, the people making fun of you are jelouse they arent thin.. they really are. i hope everything turns out okay! be happy:):):)  goodluck!|`|kdryabU8aa	Same here I'm 5ft 7ins and weigh 7 1/2 stone.........i eat loads.

The only time i gain weight was when i was pregnant|`|8EnlSE93aa	i'm 15 and since starting puperty and my period ive started to put on abit of weight. may last year (when i just turned 15) i was about 6stone to 6 and a half stone.  im nearly 16 now and i was a late developer, now i've started my period and my breasts are starting to grow more rapidly my weight is creeping up. (im now 7 and a half stone on a bad day).  my weight is constantly shifting between 7stone8 and 7stone12, im about 5"5/5"6.  i dont know if you saw the programme on the other night called 'why arent skinny people fat?' if not have a look on youtube. it says that for some people find it impossible to get fat and put on alot of weight. i know what i'm talking about, i've always been thin and have a high motabalism, and i've researched this over the years. fatty healthy foods like dairy (cheese, milk, eggs) also nuts are fattening. go on a sort of a crash diet and set yourself a goal of calories each day. think about how many calories you eat in a normal day and double it. just make sure you reach the calorie goal in any way possible even if this means extremely fattening treats (full fat cream and chocolate cakes/mousses, pork pies) look on the internet for fatty things and go on alot of websites and read about fattening foods etc.  also, go on http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/Calcula... its a Body Mass Index calculator and tells you weather you are underweight or not. it seems like alot but if you dont put on weight after eating loads of calories in a day then its hard but you have to accept your body the way it is. i have and its going good.  good luck(:|`|pujlEZuqaa	As long as you feel you eat normal  dont worry about it! kids are usually thin because of high metabolism and being so active. I was very thin till my 20s then i actually had to start trying to be thin lol.    I would suggest working out with weights if you want to build mass.  I used to jog and work out with weights and it helped.

rFUqIakAaa	Here's an even better comparison between the two kinds of penises.  http://www.circumstitions.com/Restric/co...    Maybe you could just wear a condom every day?|`|TsjqzanQaa	Dekeratinization of the glans takes time, and some achieve it faster than others.    Sometimes it comes off just like skin peeling after a sunburn, and other times it is gradual; it varies from person to person.    And sometimes it happens multiple times.    I've been restoring since March 2007, and have only partly dekeratinized the corona (edge) of the glans, but have really gained in sexual sensitivity, and also the intensity of my orgasms has really improved.    My new foreskin isn't yet complete, it doesn't cover 24/7 yet, but is intermittent, sometimes retracting on its own after an hour or so, and sometimes it slips down to cover 2/3 of the glans on its own.    While I didn't have cracks and grooves, exactly, the texture of my glans was rough and dry, and now has become smoother, and almost the normal satiny look that a complete penis is supposed to have when erect.         Restoring is the best thing that I've ever done for myself, and I now am fully aware of what sexual feeling was stolen from me with my foreskin when I was an infant.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|lGSUToFQaa	you have a good point|`|YDYsjSdZaa	i like the pictures|`|EQ9AM9t0aa	I like the pictures, but I don't mind the cracks and grooves.

Besides, they say you should wait a month after starting the pill before you have sex to make sure it will take effect. HOWEVER, the pill is still not 100% reliable......  You can squeeze the base of the penis if you think youre going to come (you can practice this on your own when your having a ****, along with thinking of something else!) or you could pull out and carry on stimulating her manually or orally whilst you cool down for a bit before going in again.|`|KOH5kPuLaa	manually knock one off first|`|zUIlDouPaa	^ seconded (two up)|`|TNgOYTobaa	I would suggest using a condom all the time still, unless you want to run the risk of getting her pregnant.

However--to make it less painful, you should use some lube. Get something like Astroglide at any drug store, and use a lot of it. Also check out www.vaginismus.com
NyTkZJQ0aa	Everyone's body is different.  Therefore, you will probably never look like that no matter how much weight you lose.  But, you are pretty slim for your height already.  If you just want to look better, or more fit, just exercise more often and tone up.  Do abdominal exercises and if you already do this, add on.  Of course, all of that is common sense.|`|1XPjQmHYaa	i wonder if this is just another sad little sap fishing for compliments on the internet. go out and get some friends, im sure they will tell you you look nice.|`|XI7gT2Njaa	lol get over it and yourself. your already bones. try gaining some weight|`|0892ed1cd4da457e97d205b608ac700eaa	you already do look like that.

tyWacgrGaa	It depends on a few factors. How much fat you currently have on your stomach, are you an athlete (softball, fieldhockey, etc.), your ab routine, and genetics. As a female it is much tougher (and will take longer) to build ab muscles compared to a man, but you can still get a tight tone look.     Cardio is the most important thing you can do right now (body fat is stored on the hips and stomach first), keep burning the fat if you want to see your abs poke thru. You should see results from running faster than you will from any ab routine, you will be tighter all around.    If you are trying for that six pack you will probably see a difference after about a month of a committed ab routine, and around 3-4 months (with cardio) you'll be nice and cut. I suggest doing 3-5 different exersizes of 3 sets and high reps.      (and if you are feeling motivated, it is OK to work abs everyday)
zfv7YXiaaa	Ideally you need to burn 300-500 calories on a 3-5 day work out schedule to lose weight.  But you also have to make sure you're eating healthier and maintaining your metabolism.  You need to be getting 3-5 servings of fruit/veggies (not both but total) and cut out the high calorie crap like burgers.. go for lean meats like turkey, chicken breast, etc.  Also don't drink pop, drink WATER WATER WATER.|`|al0cCPb6aa	I would suggest doing 30 lunges on each leg a day. Wish I could tell you how much you would lose, but I don't know your dieting. If your drinking 8 plus cups of water a day and you're consuming around 1,000-1,200 hundred calories a day you can lose up to 10 pounds a month.
aaf8d3dcd31b63f6d689b4ef93c53fceaa	You should aim to lose about 2 pounds a week. So for 100 pounds it would take about 1 year. to lose a pound you should reduce intake by 3500 calories. Reduce your calorie intake by 3500 calorie a week and burn 3500 calories a week exercising and you lose 2 lbs a week. 3500/7 is just 500 calories per day. Or do one or the other, or just 250 to lose 1 pound a week and it will take you 2 years.
AA11988490	Hey! I am 5'6" & weigh the same, so I know you aren't fat! :)   As for your meal plan, it sounds pretty good. But you didn't list water very much, & H2O is very important!   For breakfast, the best way to start the day is with protein-an egg on toast, a slice of turkey (unprocessed of course). I also agree with the other posters-ranch is terrible for you (but it tastes sooo good right?) I gave up my ranch & now use sea salt & pepper on my salads. It really brings out the flavor of the veggies! Also, leave out the chips (if you really want chips, try making your own using thinly sliced turnips sprinkled with salt & baked in the oven) For a snack, try a helping of nuts, like almonds or peanuts, & some more fruits & veggies.   Good job & good luck on being healthy!|`|9xnSnRmraa	lol|`|FSuT3bIxaa	if ur looking to get thinner dont eat bagel. or porkchop|`|IoT9ZO7Haa	ur doind a perfect plan but maybe you should vary ur meal a little more maybe like different stuff each day.|`|eJBu8765aa	Sounds pretty good at the first sight - but carefully.

If you are worried about and want to monitor your in take compared to your fitness outgoing, a good free website is www.fitday.com I love using it.|`|HH6Z3jQ0aa	yup yup that sounds goood|`|dE4pdCX0aa	yea it sounds great and is a very healthy eating plan :)  But i would definitely recommend cutting out the cream cheese with the bagel because cream cheese is just full of fat.  The bagel is also an excess fatty type of bread which is hard for the body to digest. You should try some carrots with homemade hummus for a snack instead.   This u can make in your blender. Its really simple:    1 table spoon of Tahini   half a can of chickpeas   squeeze of lemon   A table spoon of plain yoghurt    It lasts ages an will be more like 3 snacks!   And its sooo healthy!!!    Enjoy     Hope this helps     Courtney xox|`|AA10951959	well to break it down:    breakfast: smoothie= 100-200 calories  lunch: sandwich = 300 calories / dressing = 50-100 calories / chips = 150-250 calories  snack: bagel 500-700 calories  dinner: pork chop = 150-300 calories / baked potato w/ yogurt = 300 calories  snack: banana = 100   so you're taking in 1650-2250 calories a day.    In 24 hours you burn 13 calories for every pound that you weigh, so you need approximately 1885 a day.    hope this helps =]    you can always check out websites like   http://caloriecount.about.com/  and  www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/|`|XJqFqAnsaa	maybe a banana salad would be better do than you woent be as hungry later|`|OHDXO5Dsaa	You sound like you are eating just enough.

ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	pre-*** fluids can impregnate you, that is why pulling out does not guarantee you safe from pregnancy... as many many women thru the ages have found out.  Splashing ejaculant around outside your vagina will not get you pregnant, but if he penetrated you without a condom, you can get pregnant, whether he ejaculated inside or not.  If you are in no place to have a child, then you have NO business engaging in any kind of unprotected sex.  Suggest you wait six weeks from your last intimacy and if you haven't gotten a period, test for pregnancy.  Trying to test sooner than that will not give an accurate reading.|`|AA11481224	its called ejaculation or ejaculating  and its vagina if you cant use the proper terms you shouldnt be having sex    you can get pregnant from preejaculate  as there is sperm in it    the pull out method is not effective birth control  use a condom every time from the start on and use a dental dam for oral sex|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	It's not common, but it can happen. Sperm move really fast.|`|cMRJ8jMUaa	Well if you can't call a penis a penis and a vagina a vagina and admit to being in no place to have a child WHY THE **** DID YOU HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX WITH SOMEONE???    Yes, it's possible to get pregnant.|`|pNgsP3sLaa	Preggers? Va-jay-jay? O_o;; God I hope not. I would hate to think that someone like you is reproducing..|`|J5zqZp7Qaa	It's possible, yes. Look into the morning after pill, if you would not oppose taking it.|`|KrMPaCNGaa	it could happen, those lil bastardds can swim:)  my sister knew this girl who was a virgin and was pregnant because of it.|`|7mB2Hkj0aa	yes it is possible don't stress because if you arent pregnant, stress can still make your period late. and next time use protection.|`|LBwkckvkaa	if it went in then there is a chance that you could get pregnant.|`|2bOP8Fdnaa	its possible but highley unlikely. Just think about the likely hood of getting pregnant if he went in you. maybe what 5-10%. So when you think about it even if he came outside and a little got in it would be less then 0.01% youd get pregnant. Im no doctor but it makes sense to me.|`|MS5OBY9Waa	According to Planned Parenthood:    "pregnancy is possible if semen or pre-ejaculate (pre-***) is spilled on the vulva and gets into the vagina".    Also, the pre-*** is discharged well before a man ejaculates, so you can get pregnant even if he doesn't reach an orgasm.|`|MsSHhX8zaa	Yeah it is possible. It's very possible to get pregnant just from using the pull-out method like you were. There is something called pre-ejaculate that comes out of the penis during sex...and that pre-ejaculate contains sperm. Even though he may pull out before he ejaculates, the pre-ejaculate will still be inside of you.     If he did ejaculate on you and some of it made contact with the vagina, then there is a possibility. It would have had to have been pushed in somehow though.    Try using a condom next time.

DO NOT APPLY A HEATPAD TO HER FACE, IT WILL SPREAD THE INFECTION, (my dentist told me this!)|`|S3tVSDfaaa	you can buy numbing cream at stores.

Anyway, you take a towel and for a couple minutes soak it under hot water. Then apple it on your cheek to the side where it hurts and try to fall asleep on the side or just lay there doing something.

One or two saltine crackers is usually OK.  See how you feel an hour later or so, and if all goes well, you can try eating more.    Stay away from anything greasy for a couple days though.|`|Lc3POYy0aa	you need to at least eat crackers, maybe some chicken noodle soup, eating nothing will make u sicker.|`|smFfcmYuaa	Personally I've always felt that even if you're throwing up you should keep eating so that you at least get some nutrients. But assuming it's only been 1 day for you I'd count on being laid out for the other two days and eating lightly. However when a person is really puking bad they'll vomit liquid as well so that's a positive indication.    And oh yeah, with stomach flu you often have horrible and green diarrhea (green mucus is usually a sign of regular flu). So if that's going on you're not out of the woods and once it stops or at least turns back to a healthy brown then you should be alright.|`|bjpKLdfkaa	It's over when you feel good.    it's really that simple.    Oh, and never stop eating. Always eat, make sure its healthy food though.|`|1Sl45kHMaa	to be on the safe side I can say when you feel good like today, Still give your body and stomach 2-3 days to start eating heavy again. Stick to the warm soups.

You obviously know this isn't healthy for you and there are better options other than starving yourself. I would eat 3-5 times daily but a very very small portion, like a tablespoon of peanut butter or half a banana. You probably won't be able to not eat for that long and then crash, it' s really a lot more realistic to do it a little slower.|`|f21733d268f623b7683a507c37ec873caa	cut off your legs,,,,|`|rxkgmEgVaa	yea dont do tht, u could end up hurting urself, bad.|`|BUrxyH4Zaa	hello 4nd...

f9f27Cmhaa	They come from a virus - herpes simplex (HSV).  There are antivirals (such as Abriva) that shorten the amount of time it takes to recover from a cold sore, but there's no cure.
iLrp65oXaa	If you eat under 1200 calories a day your body will go into starvation mode and you will not lose weight.  Your body will be trying to hold on to everything is has.      You need to eat more today, and tomorrow especially since you are a growing child.|`|wDtA9hrhaa	No you should have at least 1,500! and why are you looking at fat grams??? that has nothing to do with loosing Weight. Same with carbs.  Most fat is good for you and your body needs it to survive and build muscle.|`|MF9YknDYaa	Do you know how many calories I had today?No,neither do I,get a life and enjoy it.
iLrp65oXaa	Any diet that said you could lose 5 kg in two weeks would be unhealthy and probably full of crap.  Also you can't chose where you are going to lose weight from.  You may lose 5 kg and still have a beer gut.    I would cut out the beer entirely and just eat sensibly.  Drink water, eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetable.  You can also increase your gym workouts.  A healthy rate to lose weight would be under a kg a week.    Note: How much beer do you drink?  If you drink everyday and more than 3 drinks a day stopping suddenly could put you into alcohol withdrawal.  You should consult a professional if you think you have a problem with alcohol.|`|OHDXO5Dsaa	I would try the Atkins diet.  It is a good way to get quick results.  Cut down on your simple carbs and focus on complex carbs (ex. eat more wheat).  You should also work on portioning your meal sizes.  Eat smaller meals more frequently throughout the day so your body can asborb the nutrients you need without storing fat.  Also when you buy meat make sure that it is "lean."  I would suggest staying away from red meat such as steak or pork and focus more on fish, turkey, and chicke, since those meats have less fat.
AA10358331	No.. if you have older brothers and sisters and they have children. Its totally alright. I have a friend who's an uncle the same age as his niece.

QB37uaVoaa	First, what happened? I hope you are alright?    In the first hour after getting hit a cold pack or some ice will reduce the inflammation response and therefore the swelling and the characteristic  hematoma or bruising. Not moving the part body part that has been hit for several hours after the trauma will also help. After the bruise is already there little can be done to make it go away, although keeping the area warm and exercising may make them go faster by increasing absorption and metabolism in the body. Again, after the bruise has settled in, it will take several days for them to go away.|`|0e9846c69a3447404194ba8083d4f969aa	Use them for evidence when you report him to the police.|`|zWsbkLBOaa	Bruises arnt medicated and cant be, Just where a jacket with a hood around.
4FEsUml9aa	well when i was 13 i weighed 113 to 115 but i was so active you would not beleive. maybe its just ur metabolism, not everyone is going to be the skinniest person ever but as long as your not having health problems or problems with your joints and if you can do everything as normal your fine! dont worry about it, just stay active and stay away from the bread! ugh! thats what gets me! bread and pasta! start eating more fiber like yogurt, yoplait is good and cheerios! youll be good!|`|Cr0wCMzlaa	Your not overweight. You can`t really judge this until you stop or slow down growing from puberty.  Probably around 14 years old. At that point you`ll be able to tell better.  Your height will be closer to where its going to be and your metabolism will settle in a little.     But if your concerned about it, then maybe a little exercise , maybe running , wouldn`t be a bad idea.|`|k1WJ3ocYaa	The key for losing weight is simple - eat less food and workout more - the problems appear when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are a lot of stumbling blocks in the real world aren't there?! The one method that really showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it was reported in Fox News and USA Today. I shed twenty five pounds, it really does produce results!

Do those streches everyday.|`|SuxD6qSHaa	Take beginners yoga class with a trained instructor. You can also do gymnastics, kungfu, pilates etc. Be slow and gradual. April is a lot of time, you should be able to get reasonable flexible by that time. Do rush anything, otherwise you might end up injuring yourself. Whenever you learn a new stretch, stretch 70% of how much you think you can stretch, that way you would be able to avoid injury. Gradually as you get better, you can stretch further. In 1-2 months you would become reasonably flexible if you practise everyday. Good luck!|`|7fuoqzkXaa	have some one help u so they make sure you r doing it right  also doesn't matter how much it hurts just go 4 it
4HQxLXQCaa	The most fat you can lose in a healthy and effective way is maybe 3-6lbs of pure fat by the 20th of February (hey you should not have procrastinated if it meant that much to you).  If you try to lose more weight than this, it will actually be water weight and muscle mass, not fat.  That said, you will look just as fat, except you will be dehydrated and you won't have as much muscle to maintain bodily shape.    To lose fat:  1. DONT BELIEVE THOSE FAD DIETS!  DIET PILLS ARE GIMMICKS! Yes, Acai berries/pills/juice is a fad diet.  2. DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF!  Unless you are 4ft tall, a 1,200 calorie a day diet is DANGEROUS and won't work in the long run.  3. Calculate your BMR.  Do a google search.  A good calculator would ask for your age, height, weight, and activity level.  4. Eat healthy and eat about 500 calories a day less than your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).  Your BMR is how many calories you need per day to maintain your current weight.  5. Eat 5-6 small meals a day.  This keeps your metabolism up.  Each meal should include fruits, veggies, water, and protein.  5. Drink at least 64oz (8 8oz glasses) of water a day.  No soda (that includes diet soda).  6. Do light/moderate cardio 3 to 5 times a week for 30 to 45 minutes each time.  Running, bicycling, and swimming are great for this.  7. Do some strength training to make sure you lose fat and not muscle.  Don't worry; you won't look like the hulk if you lift weights.  8. You should lose about 1-2lbs (.45-.9kg) per week.  If you lose more than that, chances are the rest is stool, water weight, or even muscle mass.  9. Weigh yourself only once a week at the same time (ie every Friday morning).  Your weight fluctuates a lot during any 24hour period because of water and food intake and also bowel movements.  Be patient and be smart.  If you follow this guideline you will be very happy with your results.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	First off, take pictures of your body, not face. Second. Your not fat or look close to being a little overweight. Your only 13 so why care. It's not like you need a boyfriend to get laid. But if you try you could lose about 10-17 pounds.|`|j98CkMzVaa	Well i think you are really fit but if you do want to lose weight only lose about 1 pound a week max. Eat wholemeal breads proteins good carbs ie. wholemeal bread, brown rice etc. The main thing is burn more than you take in. Measure your bmr. just google it. Then eat about 200-300 cals less than this a day. Jog or cycle or do some excercise and you will easily lose a pound and weak and look great for the dance although you look great anyway.|`|kpkpMCgRaa	i don't think you need to lose any weight, but if you'd like to eat healthier foods and start an exercise routine, you should ask you doctor.  i think you should dress in clothing that would flatter you body (you seem to have an awesome hourglass shape! iz jealous!).  you should also think about posture (which can actually make you look slimmer by the way) and smile more! the more confident you look, the more confident you'll feel and you won't ask more 'how can i lose weight really fast' questions.
AA10045887	Obviously you need to take a lacitive and increase your fiber in your diet because something is wrong.  Try Exlax or something similar for now.

Go to the library and take out some workout DVDs or videos. They have a lot of nice stuff. Light weights will help you too because the more muscle tone you have, the more calories you burn. Also, you dont want to lose weight and just have flab. you want some definition there.   Just watch your portions, really work out for 30 minutes because if you dont, you are only cheating yourself. The firm has great videos.     Good luck.|`|HijQu2lAaa	yes, you can!    @ december i weighed 156 pounds, at 5'2  then by jan. 28 (today) im at 134 pounds.    i started exercising, minimal at first, 15 mins on a treadmill a day, then 30, then 40.    if i drink an energy drink i saw that i could run more that regularly, i ran for 4 hours straight once.    its good to take carbs out of your diet.  no breads, pasta, or rice.    be sure to drink alot of water & stay away from junk food, even though indulging yourself once in awhile isn't bad.    if theres any more questions, you can hit me back.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Its possible, and you should do it by eating healthy, and making lifestyle changes.  NOT starving yourself.  If you try to make yourself suffer and go hungry you are not going to lose any weight.  Concentrate on eating fruits, veggies, chicken and fish.  Watch your portions, don't drink soda, don't over do condiments like dressing and ketchup.  Even without working out, I think you could lose quite a bit of weight just eating healthy like this.  I have done it numerous times.  Eat at least 5 times a day, normal portions.
tt1EMG6Yaa	There can be many different reasons - depends on the person really. Sometimes it can be inherited such as a small jaw that can't properly accommodate teeth without adjusting the bite. Orthodontic issues can also been caused by bad childhood habits - thumb sucking, using a dummy/pacifier for too long, or pushing on ones teeth with their tongue etc.     Probably best not to dwell on the reason, but concentrate on getting it fixed.
Y3xQzZEWaa	It is normal if you are athletic. You burn off more calories(energy) and so you need to replenish those lost calories by eating more. It's no big deal especially if you are not fat.

Make it very hot and just inhale the tea through your nose. Even if you're stuffy, some steam will make it through and does a great job of clearing the sinuses.

ZjhQ6PL8aa	I've always found careerbuilder to be a reliable way to find jobs as they are a major sponsor in the local paper ads where I live and they also have a website.  Unfortunately we're in a bad economy right now so many jobs that might normally be filled are being left vacant so that people don't have to be laid off at a later time.  If your interested in finding a job related to this degree you can try local gyms, hospitals and rehab facilities as these are the prime locations where your degree could be very handy.  You might even have to take a job in an unrelated field till the economy turns around and companies decide to fill those vacancies that are being left open.|`|W1tx1p2iaa	try acsm.org    http://www.acsm.org/AM/Template.cfm?Sect...|`|e7Q4RfNsaa	try looking for a job at the Dept of Veteran's Affairs (VA hospitals): www.usajobs.gov
mHHy7Foraa	There's no point answering cause others have already done it, but that guy above me... AMO or something??    You are wrong.    You can even test it by getting a big lump of one pound of fat and putting it into a calorimeter ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorimeter ).    One pound of fat has 3,500 cals in it, no matter how much you eat normally.    AMO... don't try and be clever. You are only wrong...

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|3d1XRIzkaa	For breakfast, have a bowl of Special K or Cheerios with Skim Milk.

Between meals, drink lots of water. No Soda Pop, even Diet Soda.|`|MmfoDbikaa	Go on an all fruits and veggies diet for two weeks. Detox your body, so afterwards you'll be able to handle real foods with a good attitude and just make better and healthier decisions.     When you done with that just eat a lot of lean protein:  chicken   fish  turkey  low fat beans, like black ones  and whey protein powder    Along with a bunch of fruits and vegetables diet, and only eat complex carbs, whole wheat breads and cereals, none of white bread or sugary cereals. And just cut down carbs overall.     Some good healthy snacks are:  non fat yogurt   skim milk  turkey slices wrapped around pickle spears  rice cake snacks  fruit  and special K cereal|`|cl4wdRnvaa	Do it slowly. You do have a better chance than me. I'm 36 years old and weigh 199.5 pounds. I used to be about 165 pounds a few years ago and when I quit smoking a became fatter. I have gone up and down. I was 179.5  pounds two years ago and made it down to 188 pounds last summer. I suggest counting your calories. Stay away from the junk food, soda and fatty foods.    I usually do better in Spring and Summer, because all I like to do is ride my mountain bike. It is too cold in New York to peddle a bike in Autumn and Winter.|`|CP8X3X4raa	You are 13 years old you should really just focus on changing your eating habits. This is the hardest thing to do. To train your brain not to acknowledge all the snacks and things your friend do. So...I suggest you add fruits and veggies to your diet. Grab an apple or a banana when you are hungry in between meals. Load up on the veggies at dinner and join a sports team...Basketball, Volleyball or the Dance Squad. If you don't want to do that...Grab a friend and do a workout video at home. Walk up and down your stairs for 20min. Lift 5lbs dumb bells while you watch t.v. Turn on your radio and blast your favorite music an dance around for 30 min. That will give you enough cardio and together with eating better you will see slow but noticeable wieght loss. Good luck.|`|Dys1Iebnaa	for a diet you could try this:  breakfast: 1 smallish bowl of multigrain cheerios  midmorning snack(optional)- 1 cup of grapes  lunch- turkey sandwich: wheat bread, cheese, and light mayo.- lays baked chips, carrots and ranch dressing  snack: 1 med. orange or a veggie side dish  dinner: bowl of spaghetti, with 1 grain, 1 fruit and 1 veggie side    excercise schedule    mon.. wed- 200 abs, run in place for 20 minutes  tues.. friday- 400 abs  thurs.. sat- 300 abs, 20 pushups  sun- day off.    abs are a variety of choices.. not just situps and crunches. explore the world.|`|tRu8Pc8kaa	regular exersice mainly arobic|`|2jNEr0WXaa	Just change the way you eat (Eat salads, eat grilled foods instead of fried, and just watch your fat intake) and only drink water, if you can you need to walk everyday for about 30 minutes just bundle up if it's snowing.

rpnFxnCQaa	Moderate consumption of chocolate seems to be able to promote improved health. However, liberal consumption is certainly not a wise health practice. The health benefits of chocolate could equate to those of red wine. In other words, moderation is the key.    That being said, any sort of chocolate will bring roughly the same benefits.

e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	It is normal. There is another girl asking the same type of question on yahoo answers. Lots of women are like you. I have a great group of friends, we have been friends since 1976 and we talk about everything. There are two who believe they have longer inner labia. One says that it gives her pain and pinches when she walks.     If you are not having any life altering situations from this, leave it alone. If someone feels that it is unattractive, they are not for you anyway and may be immature. Most men think that any vag is great. Really, do you think that most women see a man's shaft as attractive...probably not. Looks dont matter, its how you feel.      There is a surgery that shortens them but I would not suggest it unless you are having problems. Sometimes, there are infections that girls get after that, just like with any surgery.     Most women have inner labia that hang lower than the outer labia. That is not a deformity. It is no big deal. I think the only thing you should be worried about down there is your hygiene and health.     A healthy vag is abeautiful one. Lots of women dont like the way they look but I dont know any real men who would complain about it.    Let it go,  Sweetie. I am sure you a rock star if this is all you are worried about.|`|V675pNwiaa	Go to a gyno they can help you.|`|0nZMqBLUaa	i am the EXACT same way.   and i dont know if its normal / attractive or not :(  sorry , i can't help you  but you're not the only one :)|`|jRdoDu3raa	attractive....men don't care....as long as they are getting some>|`|o4IHt3EAaa	it's ok that's normal i have a big inner labia to,and my bf like it.  if dont like it,try to grow a hair around your vagina,it will cover your labia.

Pregnancy takes about a week to 10 days to settle into place. Pregnancy tests aren't very accurate until a few days after a missed period.        Also, Look into Plan B if the condom came off within the last 72 hours.     http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppsi/pl...      If for some bizarre reason she is pregnant you can    a. Keep it, and with your lack of knowledge on how the female reproductive system works, I'd say this probably isn't the best idea.  b. Adopt it out  c. Abort it medically or surgically. If you choose this, I recommend Medically and a lot of therapy for her.|`|DaFIrZVxaa	Go see a doctor, or buy a handheld test. wait a while, then do it again if its negative the first time.and pills don't always work.|`|Kz6M8NBEaa	Take her to the doctor!

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.
KFyFmi1Iaa	Yes it's normal. you're feet often swell during pregnancy. Usually it occurs a little sooner in the women that get it If you're walking around barefoot a lot this could be the cause of the swelling. You're feet are carrying around extra weight and aren't being supported by anything comfortable. My mother walked around barefoot and pregnant during her 3rd pregnancy, she can't walk around the house without a comfortable pair of shoes on and she has an ugly mosaic of very visible veins going up the back of her legs. So if you're not wearing any shoes right now dear, go gets some slippers on.
HjEtPHbaaa	I don't know. I can do it since like i was 15 too.(im 18) But yeah its easy but i can explain it. You have to have a chest to do it first so yeah you got to work out. But its easy i just cant explain it, its kinda like contracting your chest muscle that is connected to your armpit muscles or tendon and then your chest goes up. Best explanation i can think of

Most likely your heart rate is going so fast that you only have time to take short breaths instead of deep ones. Hope this helps!|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Take a deep breath, right now. What if your breath was stopped halfway through it. You would be "short of breath".|`|pRF5LLloaa	It means you feel like you can't breath.    Sometimes this is normal. If you run a 1/2 mile sprint, you will probably have shortness of breath after you do it.  That is expected, and it is OK.    But if you feel like you can't breath by WALKING that same 1/2 mile, or you feel like you can;t breath after climbing stair, or you feel like you can't breath even when just setting down -- THEN you need to see a doctor.  These cases are serious, and are probably the result of a more serious disease.    Shortness of breath can be caused by anemia, poor circulation, congestive heart failure, bronchitis, pneumonia, heart failure, or even heart attack.    If you can't explain why you are short of  breath, then you NEED to see the doctor very soon.
6NA2MXNPaa	It's definitely a sinus infection. Have you been getting headaches? Pain and or pressure in your cheeks and your forehead? You already mentioned the green snot, loss of taste and loss of smell; those are other symptoms. Any time you have green snot you need to see a doctor, green is a sign of infection. So, you need to go to the doctor to get some antibiotics. The sinus infection won't go away on its own, you have to have the antibiotics. Don't hesitate, call and make the appt right away so you can start to feel better soon! Take care!|`|HYlWlETAaa	This may be a sinus infection not a cold.  Go to the doctor|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	It's probably a sinus infection and I'd DEFINITELY go to the Dr.! They can prescribe you something to help heal ya! Don't let it go on! Kick it before it turns for the worse! Hope this helps!|`|pRF5LLloaa	The green snot indicates a sinus infection.    GO TO YOUR DOCTOR NOW!  Sinus infections need extra help.    Your sense of taste and sense of smell are intimately related.  If you can't smell then thing taste different.  You can't smell because of the sinus infection.    So go to the Doctor, get the necessary meds for the sinus infection, and when the disease heals the smell and taste will return.

1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	"Dr. Anthony Luke, assistant professor of orthopedics and director of primary care sports medicine at UC San Francisco, says that ankle weights make muscles, such as hamstrings, quadriceps and glutes, work harder to do the same motion. "It's giving a better workout for those big muscles." There's also a bigger cardiovascular benefit, because you're using more exertion.    Now for the downside: "It will put more force on the joints as well as the muscles," he says. "If there's an existing problem, it can make things more difficult."    If you're healthy and have no joint problems, you may be fine. But if you feel any aching in your joints, or you change the way you move to accommodate the weights -- and that results in pain -- then stop.    Luke also recommends not using the weights every time you do your cardio activity. And don't use them if they get in the way, for instance when you're riding a bike.    Kent Adams, director of the exercise physiology lab at Cal State Monterey Bay, isn't a big fan of adding extra weight, because it can increase the impact loading on the joints, causing unnecessary stress. And you won't just feel it in your ankles: Hips and knees can feel it too, especially in the case of people who are frail or overweight.    If you want more bang for your workout, instead of adding ankle weights, Adams suggests increasing cardio intensity by varying your speed or climbing hills. That will give you a bigger calorie burn as well.    And if you want to develop your leg muscles, you can do that during weight training, Adams says. "|`|gIMZaY02aa	I can't comment on bone growth, but in general I think ankle weights are probably going to be a waste of your time.    If you have a set of free weights and or a bar you can get a fair workout at home.
pvYy6iTSaa	Jacqueline - people with RLS feel uncomfortable sensations in their legs, especially when sitting or lying down, accompanied by an irresistible urge to move about. These sensations usually occur deep inside the leg, between the knee and ankle; more rarely, they occur in the feet, thighs, arms, and hands. Although the sensations can occur on just one side of the body, they most often affect both sides.     Because moving the legs (or other affected parts of the body) relieves the discomfort, people with RLS often keep their legs in motion to minimize or prevent the sensations. They may pace the floor, constantly move their legs while sitting, and toss and turn in bed.     Most people find the symptoms to be less noticeable during the day and more pronounced in the evening or at night, especially during the onset of sleep. For many people, the symptoms disappear by early morning, allowing for more refreshing sleep at that time. Other triggering situations are periods of inactivity such as long car trips, sitting in a movie theater, long-distance flights, immobilization in a cast, or relaxation exercises.     The symptoms of RLS vary in severity and duration from person to person. Mild RLS occurs episodically, with only mild disruption of sleep onset, and causes little distress. In moderately severe cases, symptoms occur only once or twice a week but result in significant delay of sleep onset, with some disruption of daytime function. In severe cases of RLS, the symptoms occur more than twice a week and result in burdensome interruption of sleep and impairment of daytime function.     Symptoms may begin at any stage of life, although the disorder is more common with increasing age. Sometimes people will experience spontaneous improvement over a period of weeks or months. Although rare, spontaneous improvement over a period of years also can occur. If these improvements occur, it is usually during the early stages of the disorder. In general, however, symptoms become more severe over time.     People who have both RLS and an associated condition tend to develop more severe symptoms rapidly. In contrast, those whose RLS is not related to any other medical condition and whose onset is at an early age show a very slow progression of the disorder and many years may pass before symptoms occur regularly.     How is restless legs syndrome treated?      Although movement brings relief to those with RLS, it is generally only temporary. However, RLS can be controlled by finding any possible underlying disorder. Often, treating the associated medical condition, such as peripheral neuropathy or diabetes, will alleviate many symptoms. For patients with idiopathic RLS, treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms.     For those with mild to moderate symptoms, prevention is key, and many physicians suggest certain lifestyle changes and activities to reduce or eliminate symptoms. Decreased use of caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco may provide some relief. Physicians may suggest that certain individuals take supplements to correct deficiencies in iron, folate, and magnesium. Studies also have shown that maintaining a regular sleep pattern can reduce symptoms. Some individuals, finding that RLS symptoms are minimized in the early morning, change their sleep patterns. Others have found that a program of regular moderate exercise helps them sleep better; on the other hand, excessive exercise has been reported by some patients to aggravate RLS symptoms. Taking a hot bath, massaging the legs, or using a heating pad or ice pack can help relieve symptoms in some patients. Although many patients find some relief with such measures, rarely do these efforts completely eliminate symptoms

You must have no idea what it is like to go to Victoria's Secret and have the help look at you like they don't know what the heck you're doing there.

You must have missed out on having people at prom look at your corsage and exclaim, "That's bigger than your boob!"    I understand your message. That this is a real surgery and that you could die (see the stories about Kanye West's mom) and that it's not something to take lightly. That it is important to see if you're doing it for the right reasons or if you're seeking outside approval from the type of people whose opinions don't really matter. That this is a decision that will affect the rest of your life. That they will eventually have to be replaced. That there could be serious side effects like the body sees the implant as a danger and encases it in hard scar tissue. Another is the possibility of popping it and having it leak. I think you were trying to suggest that she wait until she was sure she was old enough and wise enough to make an informed decision rather than blindly doing what a possibly inept doctor is telling her to do.    However, the sarcasm is really unnecessary and not very helpful.    Now, to the person who asked the question. Drop the doctor. I think there's a major problem with any doctor who would not have told you that you are way underweight and gotten you help. I don't know if you have a metabolism issue or something else but something isn't right. Then, for him to tell you to get a 300cc high profile - on someone so small (both weight-wise and height-wise), something just sounds wrong to me. Then, remember that while the initial cost of the augmentation may sound do-able, you will eventually have to get them replaced and that if something is wrong with them, you will likely have to pay for that, too. Think about the things you could do with that money (travel to Europe, Brazil, Asia, Australia; pay for school; start saving to buy a house; etc.) and decide if an augmentation is how you would really like to spend your money. I'm small, too so I understand but I've considered an augmentation and after considering the costs and the risks, I have decided against it.|`|AA11481224	try eating and gain weight you are close to 40 lbs underweight  a healthy weight for that height is 115-125|`|3YJRqFGJaa	well the doctor should have showed u the size but maybe u should gain some weight|`|AA10531094	If he was a good doctor, he would have the silicone implants to show you and let you try them in a special bra to see if that's the size you want.

Good Luck!|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	Hmmm, I think that a person who sees her breasts as "boobs" should probably go for the largest size they make. Don't worry about the fact that it looks fake and even abnormal, cheap and slutty. What counts is that they are big.     Hopefully no one will notice the scars from the surgery. Hopefully, actually, there won't be any adverse effects from the surgery, such as coma or death. A small but statistically significant percentage of people do have adverse reactions to anesthesia.    Good luck. I'm sure your new boobs will make you riotously happy.    Nikki, you couldn't be more wrong. So much for being an armchair psychologist. I am small breasted and have never even had to wear a bra. And I learned to accept that that is who I am and there is nothing wrong with it. It doesn't need to be fixed. I don't need to be fixed. I have had to deal with all that you have and things you can't even imagine.|`|KHic5rAaaa	I would honestly really think about whether a boob job is necessary.  Since you're very underweight, you're obviously not going to have any boobs since you don't have any fat!  I would try to get my weight up to at least 100lbs by eating healthy (whole wheat bread, cereal, fruits, veggies, and lean protein) and working out and lift 5-8lb weights.  Perhaps, when you gain weight, you'll get bigger boobs.    Also, I think going to 300cc is too much for your body frame.  You are very petite and your boobs are not going to look natural.  Quite frankly, I'm not a fan of fake breasts.  I definitely think they can cheapen your image and also you could spend the money somewhere else!    My friend got breast implants in high school because she was really insecure about her body.  She totally regretted having the procedure because she realized it wasn't her physical appearance that needed to be changed.  She thought if she boasted her appearance she would somehow gain more self-esteem.  Also, all the guys thought her boobs looked ridiculous and they thought she was just an insecure joke, which is awful.      I would just really think hard about whether you truly need the procedure.  But it's your body and your choice.

Then take the pieces once frozen and hold them to the zits. The visine will constrict the veins and get rid of the red. Also if you use a mask or even toothpaste (actual toothpaste not the gel stuff) on it that will literally pull all the nasty stuff up out of it. Otherwise you will have to wait for it to rise to the surface on its own and then take care of them. I bet you lean on your hands when you sit at a desk don't you. I find that if you avoid touching your face all together it really helps clear up your skin. Wish I knew that in high school but hey figured it out my freshman year of college.

It is actually to help the poop from stinking, but I noticed that when we gave it to our three their poop got firmer.

pvYy6iTSaa	getahaircut -  By now, you probably know that lactose in milk products is a problem for you.  Lactose is digested by the enzyme lactase.  If you have enough natural or added lactase you will not suffer any intolerant effects.  You may have or can buy in the drug store (pharmacy) tablets of Lactrase (tablets which are mainly lactase). Commonly they are sold over-the-counter (no prescription required) in individual packets.  Carry a couple with you in your wallet.  If you suspect your food has or may have lactose, then take the tablets during or immediately after your meal to reduce any possible ill effects such as bloating, cramps, or belly pain.  Good luck.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	There is nothing that you can do after the fact. Just hang out in your bathroom with a book or your music or something, and pass the time.    Next time, you can take a lactase pill before you drink milk and see if that helps.    How do you accidentally drink milk???
khe7UuhQaa	Destiny, My dear listen to me . Dr.s are nice people, and medicine is a business. If they found it in the mouth, they should know wether it is for sure in the throat,or lung.  Sometimes you have to put your faith, strength, and all your hope for her in the LORD. What she has, with all the Cancer treatment Centers around the country, she is in really great hands.  Always remember, what happens, or evolves from this, this date today was on her calander of life. She would never want you to worry about her, she still has complete control of her life, and her destiny, give her credit for that, and just keep reassuring her that you are always there for her, and for her to lean on you in her time of grief. When she wants to be alone, leave her alone, and give her ,..her space, and she will depend on your shoulder more, and more. I will say a pray for you and your aunt tonight,and not to worry, this date was on her calander along time ago, and it is there for a reason which should not challenged.

I also helped my two children and husband in coping with their emotions while not over burdening each other with their own concerns.  I still pull mine out on occassion and laugh at the doodles I did in it.  I drew the cancer as a bug with a big humongous sledge hammer smashing it (Like the Raid commercials)  I think there are also some tear stains in it but it really did help.    I think my family is riddled with cancer.  My dad's parents and one of his brothers died from cancer.

u8CFwtyMaa	I assume you are talking about when you masturbate?  To learn to control your ejaculations, try the stop - go method.  Start masturbating as usual, and just before you ejaculate, stop, and rest for a minute or so. When the feeling has died down, start again. Repeat this as many times as you can, and you'll start to get more control, and will last longer, in both masturbating and sex.  If you feel you have gone too far, squeeze your penis, just below the head, very hard, between your forefinger and thumb, until the feeling goes way.  This is how I learnt to last longer, and it does work.  Hope this helps.|`|mXFOru11aa	10 minutes you have to relax|`|AA10475412	You need to relax more. I recommend you do the Stop & Go Method. You masturbate in a comfortable position. When you are about to 'come' you STOP! Wait till urge to ejaculation subsides, but do not lose your erection. Repeat this process several times. Once you decide to 'come' you will have an awesome orgasm.|`|GQfQ0TsDaa	you could just be really "excited". its different every time dont worry ^_^|`|2OO9U8o9aa	The issue with masturbation in relation to ejaculation time is that you will usually only be pleasing yourself and the urge to get to orgasm is intense . You need to learn how to delay the urge and can do this by a process called edging . Fairly simple in that as soon as you feel the approach of orgasm you stop stimulation for a bit and then restart again . If you can do this a few times it makes the eventual orgasm really intense . It just take a bit of practise and patience , but you can enjoy it as you gradually improve  Have fun M8|`|hsyI1DxDaa	Hmm, your stamina is a bit weak.

If you want to last longer, when you're masturbating (I'm assuming that's what you're talking about) if you feel like you're about to ejaculate just back off, meaning take your hands off it and let it sit for 20 seconds or so. Then get back to it and keep stopping a bit if you find yourself about to go before you want to. It's great to edge on your orgasm for a while, personally I try for about 40 minutes to an hour. When you orgasm after that then it's wonderful, and very intense, like your body is thanking you for letting it go after so much tension and waiting during your session, you'll feel like you're on a rocket ship lifting off to the moon or beyond lol.|`|cnk6hHQjaa	5-10mins|`|7Tq7EbFnaa	nothings wrong your only 15 for gods sake, keep practising. the longer you take the better,  its not a race its all about satisfying yourself and a partner, if you can do that your laughing all the way to the bedroom!|`|7PyGI4ewaa	aaaaaaaar i see.     its so normal dude. stretching your legs out perhaps to *** faster. remember, when you have sex, you go alot slower than masterbating. and it feels different, its harder to orgasim.    also if your ontop, you can control it because while your humping her you can take your mind off cumming but still maintain an erection because your rubbing against her.     its all good. 10 mins is good enough.|`|mr9Zb9biaa	I don't know how long it should take you.

Because if you go back too soon, it can relapse.  I was out 2 weeks when I had it.  Not saying you'll be out that long but you should at least give yourself a week.      Medicines don't do too much for a cold or flu.  But the Advil could help a little with the symptoms.  You'll get a little better each day.  But just think, you will be immune to the flu for a long time.     If you are a teen, do NOT take aspirin for this.  You can get a bad reaction when children or teens take aspirin for the flu.      Watch movies, read books, that way time will pass faster.  After it's over you'll be kind of tired for a few days.  Don't worry about it, it will go away.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Aspirin or advil if your not allergic.  Plenty of fluid. Rest. And you may try using a saline nose spray for the congestion.

TApVoMdAaa	Make sure you brush often don't even bother with flossing, if you forget to brush or are too lazy to do it at times either chew gum or use mouthwash. I would def. take a day or two off if you need to but I think you can manage the day with a painkiller. Take it before the appt. so it will already be in effect during the appt.  About 4 teeth getting pulled don't worry I got 5 pulled and it didn't hurt once I got my pills/ shots/ or whatever you will get. Just brush whenever you get the chance, good luck!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Hope this link helps you with all information regarding braces. Check out  http://useinfo-braces.blogspot.com/|`|150d8852f762d2b17f834aa2bf3cd981aa	I got braces a week ago and about a week 1/2 before that I also got 4 teeth pulled.  For me, getting the teeth pulled was the worst part.  Not that getting them removed was painful, just the dealing with pain afterwards and the blood was hard.  It depends on the teeth and person I guess.    I am not very good at cleaning my teeth.  Before I got braces my dentist scolded me about plaque and the sort.  All I do is brush my teeth three times a day after eating.  Try not to eat in between.  Use the toothbrushes they give you.  I'd also suggest buying an electric toothbrush.  Don't forget to floss either.  Basically follow what your dentist tells you and you should be fine.    As far as school is concerned.  I had no headaches or anything yet because of braces.  It does take time to adjust to the wires and brackets though, so use the wax they provide you.    I gone to school the next day and I was perfectly fine.  You could probably go the day you get braces too.  It is really not that bad...yet.  You could always take advil or something too if you have pain.|`|QdbKtBHwaa	I had braces on for a while. I was really scared too. No you do not have to take 2 days off from school. Your teeth will only hurt really bad with a lot of pressure, so if you normally buy lunch, bring a lunch with jello, a soft sandwich, water, applesause, and you know. I never brushed my teeth 4 times a day like they tell you. Some orthodontists will give you a special toothpaste perscription but if not, go to the pharmacy and get an over the counter flouride gel. Use it at night. It will protect your teeth. Make sure to get an electric toothbrush, because if you dont brush them a lot, you atleast want to make sure they are really clean. Trust me. After a couple of days of awkwardness they feel fine. I just recently got them off. I didnt have any white stains. Make sure to schedule a dentist appointment after you get them off, because they will clean your teeth. Also, braces will really only hurt 1 day every 6 weeks, when they are altered by your orthodontist. If you ever break a bracket or feel poking call the orthodontist. They wont be mad, they will be glad you came in soon before your teeth moved. Hope this helped|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	No you don't have to take days off. Just take Advil right after your appointment.

OuQizrQ6aa	It is unlikely that your drinking and/or smoking had anything to do with your IBS. It is coincidence that you developed IBS at the same time you were experimenting. You need to seek a better diagnosis in order to better treat the symptoms. IBS is a diagnosis that doctors will give when they don't really know what you've got.

Get some good digestive enzymes and take them whenever you eat.  You are not digesting properly.  make sure that you drink enough water. Avoid caffeine. Caffeine increases acidity and makes your bowels flush out/go faster.  Make sure you start eating enough fiber. Adding a good fiber supplement will help stop the diarrhea.  Take some acidophilus with the fiber. Start the fiber slowly and work up. It can cause some gas and bloating at first, but it really helps the kind of problems you are having.      Write a list of the foods that bother you.  Better yet, write what you eat, when, how much and and when you go to the bathroom.  Keep that for a few weeks and then take that to the doctor. That is the kind of information the doctor needs to figure out what is wrong with you.  Your past drug use may or may not have something to do with the digestive problems you are currently having.  It sounds like you have an ulcer or GERD with the acidity and constant hungry feeling.  The diarrhea could be from over acidity, too, or it could be another problem, like your body just moves food and waste through too fast.

He cant make a proper diagnosis if you leave out olot of things because you are too embarrassed to tell them.  He is a doctor what you tell him wont be told to anyone else and he wont look at you any different or treat you differently.  But its not gastritis that usually only last for a week or so because it is a virus or bacterial infection.  But heavy drinking can have alot of negative effects on your digestive system and no one on here can tell you waht is wrong with you.  You need to see your doctor and tell him everything about your symtoms as well as your history of drug and alcohol use that way he can order the right tests to find out what could be worng with you.

They tell you that because it takes 72 hours for the antibiotics to be in effect and that way you won't spread it to your partner, but you used a condom, so that won't happen. They have to put that on the box so they don't get sued, because not everyone is smart and uses condoms.     This should not affect your treatment, but if it doesn't clear up in a week, get another box and use that up just to be doubly sure its gone.|`|cmR2RqlOaa	If not try dyflucan and be sure your partner is treated.

qN92yLzMaa	A root canal is a procedure used to save a tooth that has either died or is going to die.      The tooth has a soft center called the "pulp".  Trauma like breaking the tooth, even bumping it hard (without breaking it) or decay (a cavity)going into the pulp can cause an infection (abscess).  At that point you have a choice - extract the tooth or have a root canal & keep the tooth.      A root canal is done by the dentist using his handpiece (aka drill) to creat access in the "pulp chamber" to remove the pulp.  Special, small files, reamers & broaches are used to pull out the nerve tissue and smoothe the insides of the canals.  Then a special filling material goes in to replace the pulp.      The tooth is then "built up" aka a really big filling is done.  After that it really should get a crown - aka 'cap'.  Without it being alive and having a blood supply it gets brittle and can break easily.  But at least it won't hurt when it breaks...    The thing about the procedure is - it gets a really bad rap - because sometimes there is pain.  Usually there's (bad) pain when the infection has been ignored for a while.  The sooner it's dealt with, the more comfortable the procedure can be.  And the thing about the infection is, if it's not dealt with it, a person can die from it - the swelling can get so bad that the throat closes off & a person can die from asphyxiation.  So it really isn't something to trifle with.    The link below will show you a diagram of the different layers of a tooth.        www.nlm.nih.gov|`|bTXDb5YIaa	i think they just take the tooth out from the gum or something|`|88ca921e0c252f3cf12e19d369f73438aa	tooth has a canal the the nerve is in.

If you have consumed something that is fatal you should probably go to the doctors to get your stomach pumped.    Making yourself throw up has serious reprocautions. Such as ruining the lining in your throat from stomach acids and etc.     If you have a feeling that you are going to throw up but are not or cannot, try to settle your stomach with some dry toast, or unsalted plain crackers. These help absorb the acids in your stomach, and is not as bad when you throw them up later because of your stomach upset. If you have dry heaves or anything its good to put something like that in your stomach as well because your stomach is empty and needs to throw something up. If you cant seem to get anything down food wise, try drinking clear liquids like gingerale (not sprite) and water, if the cold liquids are hard to get down too try to heat up (boil) some water and sip it carefully so as not to burn yourself >.    Otherwise there really isn't a food that will make you involuntarily throw up. unless you think its disgusting then it might make you gag. :P
exMPHWKHaa	Well it sounds like if the source of the problem which is your parents was solved then the stress would just go away. Counseling is far more then just telling someone to "fake it" or something it can really benefit for you. I would heavily recommend trying counseling, or talk with your doctor about what he can do for you. Maybe he can talk with your parents. Just don't let the stress get too bad I had a lot of stress combined with social anxiety and I have had severe OCD problems ever since.|`|QrhbTZyFaa	Align your chi

If you can sit in a warm bath tub this eveing, and just let them soak in the water, you will feel much better. Also take 2 tylinol before you go to bed, to relieve the tenderness in the area, so you can get a good night sleep. If you wear tight short, bare bottom it tonight, and you will much better in the morning. Stay on the tylinol for a few days to stop the discomfort. Good luck|`|Skap7So3aa	Awww dito !

I went to the doctor, and he thought I had an STD, but I was a virgin and my urine analysis passed anyway. He said he felt an inflammation but didn't feel anything cancerous. He diagnosed me with "epididymitis" which is a inflammation of the epididymis, the cords that go from the top of your balls and up into your body. He gave me some pills and it went away.    2 or 3 weeks ago, it came back. This time, 2 doctor visits and a testicular ultrasound later, I was diagnosed with a varicocele, which is an enlarged vein in my nutsack. It's extremely common, with 15% of men in our age range getting it. It will require a basic surgery to fix it, but I haven't had that yet.    IF IT CONTINUES, go to the doctor. I know, it sucks, I had to have a chick grope me down there, and I had jock itch to boot.     So, from my experience with your symptoms, if they continue, you could have:    --Testicular cancer (VERY UNLIKELY, but it should be mentioned anyway)  --Epididymitis  --A varicocele    If it continues, go see the doctor. It's their job to fix you.    Email me if you have any questions. Good luck!|`|AA12139459	well i have that same problem some times to. but it gos away after an hour or 2|`|LnyHC1yWaa	Well, excluding blue balls.  I had a similar problem a couple of years ago.  Had to quit wearing the boxers and move to something with a little more support (tighty whities or boxer briefs).  Little fellers may be getting jousted around too much.  For me, more common in the summer months.  After the switch of underwear took about 3 days to get back to normal, but then again I had the pain much longer than one day.
1f11fce426db0cdd8cc54eebff18b2f0aa	Hi Katt             Your in a tricky one that only your age and maturety above the situation around you can help. I work with kids like your brother and understand how demanding it can be for families and friends that have to cope with ADHD.   My advice to you is to spend some time on the internet on reliable sites such as wikkipedia, and thoroughly research ADHD & Aspergers.  There is plenty of good advice that will help you understand the reasons for his behavior and maybe team up with your mum to try and pull together with a plan of action?   There's no easy solution, but a strong family goes a long way!|`|yipMDefBaa	Learn as much about it as you can,  IT will help you understand the behaviour.    Its difficult being a sibling.  You can't do the usual brother sister things, they can be embarrassing when in public, its hard to have your friends around and as you said they get more attention whether they are good or bad.  If you can help your mum with him it might let you bond with him better.  There was a program/show on the bbc/abc recently.  Can't think of its title, but it was about a single mum with 3 boys with Aspergers/ADHD.  The 3 girls were normal.  Very sad but also funny.  Made me realise that you have to focus on the positive changes/behaviors rather then the negative.  It also looked at how other people view families with children with disabilities.|`|bjqjkDMHaa	Okay. I think I can help you out here.  I have Asperger's, and my brother is mildly-moderately autistic.  Not just asperger's.  I'm talking textbook mild autism.  he never shuts up about WWII (that's his obsession) and he is constantly overeacting (being a nine year old) and crying over weird, pointless things.  yeah, I know how it is.  What I do is  hole up myself in my room, turn on the fan to block out some of the noise and turn on my computer.  that is how i cope with family problems.  He also has ADD, and I am ADHD, plus, golden token--I have sever Tourette's.  I know it can be really frustrating, trying to talk to him is like yelling at a brick wall, but you can still coexist, I promise.  be glad you don't have Asperger's.  I have it, and all the time, I feel like some sort of alien, I talk science while my peers ooze over their boyfriends and makeup.  But I've come to sort of accept that I am different.  You'll just have to live with it.  Maybe reading a book on autism could help you understand him and the way he acts.|`|ovIxSVKbaa	sorry, that sounds like a hard position. just try to ignore them and maybe go out with your friends a lot    best wishes Isaac R|`|My7SgLfoaa	Beat him up.|`|5e4623bc68865d06ef41d87d39b31323aa	hi kat   im a single mum and i have a son who has apergers and its not easy for anyone involved     my daughter was 6 years old when he was born and from the very first day she had to take a back seat     maybe try talking to your mum about how you feel its easy as a parent to just assume your coping well as your being good and seem ok     but you need quality time with your mum too      does your family have a social worker your mum is entitled to respite care you may have a struggle to get it but it would help you all so much     you could try setting a little time for him to talk about what he likes and to really try to understand him and then making it clear his times finished and now you need time for you set a clock or timer     the only other thing i can say is try to understand he cant help it  and as he gets older he may well settle down     my son now is such a wonderful young man but  for such a long time life was hell  for all of us     good luck and try to love and understand him as much as possible x
6xVNRPraaa	Hi - it would just be called a "food intolerance" or "food sensitivity" or "food allergy". It's not Celiac Disease (CD), because that it a condition where a person has an immune reaction to  foods made from grains such as wheat, barley and rye. Rice, and corn, don't contain gluten.    First question - how do you know you are sensitive to these foods?  Also, what symptoms do you have? Have you ever seen an allergist, or talked to your family doctor about these reactions?    While the two terms "food intolerance" and "food allergy" are often used as if they are the same thing, they are actually different.     True, IgE food allergies are pretty rare - affecting maybe 4% of the population. Eggs, cows milk, peanuts, soy, wheat, tree nuts, fish and shellfish are the most common foods causing allergic reactions, but almost any food has the potential to trigger an allergy. Foods most likely to cause the most serious type of allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, are peanuts, tree nuts and shellfish.    Food sensitivities don't involve the same immune reaction. Food intolerances are usually much less severe, though they can produce chronic health problems if not addressed. Common food intolerances are lactose and gluten sensitivities. As with food allergies, treatment of food sensitivities involves identifying the foods - typically done through an elimination diet - and then avoiding the intolerant foods.|`|7utsLRfyaa	coeliac  i tink thats how you spell it
F0FByGiQaa	CoverGirl, Maybelline, Max Factor, Loreal, Neutrogena... just to name a few.    EVERYTHING is tested on animals. Makeup, floor cleaner, bathroom cleaner, certain kinds of drinks, medicine. There are so many people though who are trying to put an end to it, which is great. There are now hundreds of businesses and products who are no longer testing on animals.     You can go to the leapingbunny site or the caringconsumer site to see who doesn't test on animals, and from that list, you can determine who does test.|`|d1jMmApmaa	There's no specific "type." But for your project, you can go to the local drugstore or Sephora and check the labels on the back.  The items without a little bunny logo on the back or that don't specifically say "no animal testing" were tested on animals.    FYI: I think Revlon and Loreal items are tested on animals.
ssQb7bB3aa	It would depend on whether you are allowed to drink normal tea, such as English Breakfast Tea, Lipton tea, etc etc. Wu yi tea is just a variation of such teas - it is one that grows in China, a type that is called Oolong tea. Like all other teas, it contains tannin, which is like caffeine (one of the side effects = some people find it difficult to sleep after drinking caffeine/tannin)    As to whether you can buy wu yi tea from the internet - If you read the fine print on the internet sites which sell Wu yi, you will find that you are not allowed to do so. But I believe it has more to do with credit card legislation, rather than Wu yi being bad for your health if you are under 18 years old.    Hope this helps.|`|qgimQqhmaa	im not sure what that is but maybe read the directions if it came with any?|`|Qlrh3Z4Maa	I am pretty sure that you can drink wu-yi tea just as any other tea at any age, although i discourage going against your parents wishes if they would rather you not drink it. From my research, it is just a variety of oolong tea, which is simply allowed to oxidize longer than other teas.

And dont worry, yes you are still a virgin. Your virginity is only taken when you have sexual intercourse with another person. :)|`|BI8c6XXPaa	He broke your hymen but he didn't use his penis to do it, so yes you are still technically a virgin.

KM5MNRJmaa	wow i'm soo sorry!  :(    don't worry about crying. it's part of the grieving process and is totally natural and normal to feel like that. it might help to talk your feelings over with someone or keep a journal. try to remember all the good things. it's really hard right now, but each day will start to get a little easier.|`|1MlrO4Uxaa	Take a deep breath and try to relax - youre not depressed, its only been a day and its normal to be sad, angry or reserved... its only depression if it gets to the point where its been a long time and its still interrupting your everyday life.    ANYWAY...    are you religious? that can help if you can imagine him being in a [happy] afterlife. Try to keep off of TV, computer, or reading to an extreme amount - youre trying to distance yourself to get away from it, and itll be even worse when you get back from the tv/computer/book.

S6m6TaKDaa	I was the same way when I was your age and I'm glad I changed. For me, a specific experience woke me up and brought me to reality, I got sick of being quite, stepped on, and unhappy.     Here's my advice to you: Quit caring about people who don't effect your life in a positive way, stand up for yourself, and remember you are the most important person in your life. That may seem hard to do, but force yourself to do it until you find that you are doing it naturally. Be mean when necessary, so people don't see you as a push over. If you feel ugly; change your hairstyle, wear more make-up, go for a run every night and watch what you eat. When you have something to say, say it confidently or say it with an air of sarcasm, because you probably don't sound as stupid as you think (I'm still bad about saying stupid things too.)    As for the rest: Have a few beers, go to concerts, do something crazy, call up your friends and meet some dudes, do whatever you like makes you happy.     Don't be afraid to message me whenever you want, because I see a lot of myself in you, good luck.|`|mUpiEAFraa	Hi, You know, I was excactly like this.

I was just like you at that age.  I'm still sensitive but not as sensitive as I used to be.  I think it comes from just living life and experiencing a few things.  You will find your confidence growing and your emotional strength will increase as you age.  Be patient.  Remind yourself that you as valuable as anyone else and do not allow others to steal your joy.  {{ huggers!! }}    PS--try keeping a diary or blogging about wha tyou feel.  Sometimes when you go back and read what you felt you realize it wasn't so bad after all.  This helped me alot.

NyTkZJQ0aa	What did you starve yourself or eat less but in a healthy way?  If you ate 1200 calories or more, just stick with it.  If you starved yourself, you're kinda screwed except you could add exercise to burn off the extra calories you're eating.|`|qs6RMGvdaa	You could go on the special k plan.   Starving yourself isn't the way to go.   You can't keep switching up your diet.   Your body will not know what to do. It might stores all the food as extra fat.  And you will defiantly gain the weight back if you eat like you did before you lost the weight.     Lets say you want to be 150 pounds, and you just eat like you normally would how you want and how much you want and you maintain 170 easily. That means you're eating as much as a person weighing 170 pound person should be eating to maintain that weight. If you want to be a 150 pound, you have to eat like a 150 pound person. You can find any chart online to how many calories you're suppose to eat a day to lose weight from where you're at.
oqeoUKj2aa	could be a defense you body is doing to stop the alcohol|`|KOH5kPuLaa	sounds like a prostate prob sorry to say you need the doc to check that out|`|9a52ecafb7d9861fb98dcbfa66cdd2daaa	Have you received any thing helpful because I have the same problem?   Considering I am 100% woman it isnt prostate! lol
6YWlqDkYaa	you are on a great track. that is a perfect diet as long as you stick to it.   remember on a 1500, calorie diet.you are suppose to loose a pound a day. so thirty days and the extra workouts you do the math by spring break. good luck.
oEM2YL6Laa	Whether appendixes grumble is down to opinion- the jury seems to be out so it's up to the individual to decide for themselves.     What I have seen though is plenty of incompetent Dr's much like the one you have just described to me- and while grumbling appendixes may be debatable my cousin had hers actually rupture 3 days before she went in, it had formed a cyst over the top of it though which stopped it from poisoning her- which resulted in a painful but not agonising problem much like the one you have described to me.    Personally I would take her back in and ask for a second opinion- don't bother taking her back to the same Dr as he has obviously made his mind up. You can judge from the second opinion as to whether the first Dr needs to be reported to the medical council.    Good luck.|`|2b24d4ddbb31c0b862ca4d0411d36df5aa	check out links  or type in symptoms into search bar|`|ToztjpAsaa	If I were you I'd change my GP.  Get a second opinion.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	If she is having that much pain, why didn't he order an ultra sound? Sure does sound like her appendix and if it isn't taken care of soon, it could burst and cause major problems for her. I definitely would get a second opinion and do it now.|`|mNjjSPdVaa	Take her to another doctor immediately!  Appendix's do indeed grumble, often for some time.  Geez, then I'd report that doctor.|`|XZTf8Eahaa	I think its time for a new doctor don,t you bring her to the ER just to make sure your so called doctor should have told you what it was.  I hope shes ok.|`|KCtdICMTaa	[ doe's she have a sore throat as well, my son had severe stomach pains a few years back, and was sent to the hospital with suspected appendicitis, turned out it was a throat infection which through the lymphatic system causes severe lower stomach pain...|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	has she started her periods yet? if not eleven year olds get lots of different symptoms before they begin their periods but they are not always able to 'voice' them, she has already seen your gp and you say she cried when being examined, this could be a typical reaction to her being aware of her body  talk to her and reassure her that this is a normal process of growing up. if you have different concerns or if you feel her symptoms have changed you know what to do good luck|`|57Hb92rGaa	I would take her straight to A&E and i wouldn't leave until i got some answers and was satisfied. Please don't wait another minute with this if this is her appendix then this is serious.|`|dSOnm08uaa	appendix do grumble my sister in law had 1 on her wedding day she was told by the docs it wasnt in need of operating gave her painkillers and told to enjoy her day, appendix was removed 6 mths later, see another doc.
iLTPeMCPaa	my boyfriend and i quit for each other   sit down and have a serious talk about your future and how dong that  will affect your lives
NzyivVQLaa	sounds like the flu. had the same symptoms. you probably should go to the doc. he can say if its bacterial or viral. either way he can give you antibiotics that will help to get you better. in the mean time take nyquil :)|`|eGtScTolaa	It may be a virus, I would keep an eye on the fever, if it gets any worse go to the dr.|`|DmUG33axaa	it sounds like the flu that is going around this year, but going to the doctor won't hurt. but you are cold because you have a fever, and wearing layers isn't good for that because it will raise your temp, put a cold pack on your head and if it gets worse definitely go to the doctor.|`|BhYDTUrWaa	yes go now it might some thing other than a headache|`|TUdTYTefaa	a temp of 101.1 isn't too bad..it's elevated so i would recomend taking another tylenol.. do you have regular tylenol? or only tylenol 3?  if only tylenol 3 then follow the perscription that was given to you.  tylenol should help relieve your fever.  as far as you feeling cold, is a normal response when you have a fever. make sure your drinking plenty of fluids, even if you don't think you need it :)  the thing that concerns me is that you have asthma and your wheezing?  do you have a peek flow meter?  you may need a breathing treatment along with some other  medications.  If you have a primary physician, it's best to call and tell him/her your symptoms and let them decide.  most physicians have an answering service and they'll get you in touch with a doctor.  but if you feel like your having trouble breathing don't wait.   GO TO THE HOSPITAL if you have to, call a friend to drive you or call an ambulance.|`|3YJRqFGJaa	u should probably go to the hospital
2SXnPABaaa	who knows... you naughty stoner hahaha i dedicate my next blunt to you my good sir!|`|hr3r5Vpoaa	I think it depends on the type of blood test. If they are just looking at red blood cell counts, white counts, and other things like mineral content, enzymes... I doubt it. If they have no reason to test for that, then they won't. They don't even check blood type most of the time because it's unnecessary. I think you'll be fine, but then again I'm not sure.|`|VTyyDaUIaa	yes|`|VFOyzZJIaa	Yeah, its gonna stay in there. How often do you smoke. If you smoke every day or every other day or maybe more than 3 times a week the THC and marijuana stays in your body for a full 30 days. They might wonder what that's in there for...
fvuEtkROaa	Mono (infectious mononucleosis) is certainly  one cause, as are other viral infections.  I think your health care provider has you  on the right track with labs and a referral.  I understand your concern, but you need to wait for the results of the lab tests.  Sometimes a monotest done early in the course of the disease can give a false negative and the diagnosis is made on the results of the CBC.|`|p3NsXo0baa	I feel long lumps in my groin, balls in my armpits and little peas in teh back of my neck. Ive had scans and blood work and my doctor cant find the cause. He wont doa  biopsy cos he think smine are due to stress and being underweight.  Blood test revealed i had mono at some stage but i duno when. I worry everyday about my lumps but my doctors dont care,.  Im nearly 19 and have a 6 month old and i justw ant to be able to stop stressing and get on with life but my doctor makes it hard for me.    Im really scared i have lymphoma,, i have ALL the symptoms.Im scared my doctor wont catch it early enough.  Keep on it ok, dont walk away without answers cos u'll be like me shitty your pants not knowing whats going on.|`|KOH5kPuLaa	i had lymphoma and my lymph nodes were swollen but that can be found in a blood screening keep up with the doc and never give up|`|fRjaIyL6aa	Multiple swollen lymph nodes that are painless and do not go away are highly concerning for lymphoma.  He needs to have a biopsy of one of these lymph nodes as soon as possible.|`|ps8H35yXaa	There are a lot of different reasons to what can cause your lymph nodes to swell;    Mono  Bacterial infections  Bug bites  Animal scratches  and the dreaded Cancer, Lymphoma's and Leukemia's    The first thing that Doctor's usually do when lymph nodes are swollen is to rule out infection.  A series of anti-biotics is usually first, with CT to follow.  If they can not find anything in the lab work, demand a biopsy.  That is the sure fire way to figure out what is going on.  If anything, that can at least determine it is or isn't cancerous.      The problem is, that if the anti-biotics don't help, that usually means something else is going on.  And with that also lies a problem; when Doctor's want you to take anti-biotics it takes a week.  The longer that the lymph nodes stay swollen and there is no change, the bigger the chances there is a problem.  (Also, if you notice that his lymph nodes are swelling up fast, get him to the Doctor asap, hell I'd take him to the ER if that were the case)    Is he having other problems?  Weight loss, fevers, night sweats, loss of appetite, tiredness and fatigue?  Def. keep those things in mind when you see the Doctor to give them a better understanding how your son is from day to day.  And especially how his health has been the past months-to a year.    I myself found a lump on my neck in June of 08, I had a lot of unusual symptoms: Numbness and tingling on my left side, itchy skin, no appetite, tired and fatigued all the time, I would bruise like a banana, it all was just so strange, I had no idea what was going on, I just thought I was tired...I had been getting a lot of infections and it was taking a long time for me to recover, but I didn't think anything was wrong until my lymph nodes started to swell up...Little things by themselves usually don't mean much, but when I put them all together along they biopsied my lymph node (which was 3cm) and found out I had Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  I even went to the ER right after I found it, and they didn't even catch it.  They caught it because of the biopsy.    Because your son is so young it is very important that these Doctor's take this seriously.  And if you feel the Doctor isn't doing what you want them to do, or taking you seriously, go to another Doctor.  You could even take him into see an ER Doctor.  Childhood cancers and sickness can hit very fast, but, are very cureable if caught early.    There are a lot of good sites to look at (put in swollen lymph nodes in any major search engine) and you can find a bunch of good information about what could be going on.  Also you could visit any of the big cancer or blood disorder web sites to get a feel for the symptoms and to see if anything comes together for you.  I know we as people do not even want to fathom the idea that something this bad could happen, but being pro-active and getting to the bottom of why your son is sick, is really the best thing.    Information is the best tool we have when we don't know what's going on.  Also being prepared for the worst but hoping for the best really can help in the long run.      I feel for you and your family, and I hope that I have not upset you.   I wish you both luck and hope that everything works out for you.
AnW3dzQfaa	You can quit, I did.  No, there are no vitamins or anything you can take.  Just good old will power and don't hang out with your pot head friends anymore.
TApVoMdAaa	Take water heat it up in the microwave add sea-salt then gargle, if that doesn't work take motrin it helps with swelling and any pains.|`|J07AmW55aa	ice ice and ice|`|xu5GZsIEaa	It really depends, which kind of cheek?|`|tSZMBTOIaa	You need antibiotics ok swelling of the face of any kind is dangerous.  You got a bad tooth go to er and get some antibiotics,don't let that **** get in your blood stream dude ok.
YupMCYHlaa	There is no cure for the common cold, probably because nobody ever died of it.  My dad used to point out: If you stand in a tub of icewater, in an open doorway, in Winter time, you will get pneumonia, and there -is- a cure for that!    So take care of yourself and help your body's natural defenses to fight it off.  Keep warm.  Get lots of rest.  Drink lots of fluids.    In the meanwhile you can fight some of the symptoms.  Benedryl will help with the runny nose (and make you sleepy so you can get lots of rest.  For gosh sake don't take them at work, or you will have a big red spot on your forehead where it keeps hitting your desk!)  I find Chloraseptic works the best for me for sore throat pain.  Chicken soup is almost magical, I don't know what's in it but it's sometimes called Jewish Penecillin.|`|QI74CxD0aa	I like to make a tea from fresh ginger root.  Cut off a piece of the root and peel it, then chop it up.  Boil water.  Pour it over the ginger root and let steep.  Then sweeten with sugar or honey.    If your are congested, a tea made with a tablespoon of cayenne pepper  helps.|`|LbCnyc0Oaa	make some very hot tea.....try raspberry or green tea with citrus extracts...and add honey...not too much but be able to taste the honey in your tea.  Drink a lot....drink cup after cup after cup....don't stop.|`|EVX17AjRaa	I had a cold nor long a go and as far as medicine Dayquil and Nightquil both work very well. But the other thing I herd works is to take a hot shower and then bundle up in a ton of blankets for the night and sweat it out.
AA10723498	Could you have started your period just by a weird chance at the same time?  The piece of skin should not be there.  It sounds like the hymen, which is the thin membrane that breaks during your first time.  It should break in half and be absorbed by you body.  If it doesn't go away, you many have to see and OB.  How old are you?|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	The skin is your hymen, it breaks when something goes in for the first time. It is an unnecessary piece of skin and will just break off in a while.|`|es49dkt2aa	Idk about the peice of skin but i can see mine torn or atl lease thats what it looked like.. as for the bleeding i was the exact same way. i spotted for about 3 days. i lost my virginity 2 weeks ago.
sKBH10Myaa	Cut guys sometimes do last longer, which is a good thing!  Here a few points: 1) don't be afraid to grip it really tight-they can handle it! 2) concentrate on the area under the head where it meets the shaft.  On uncut guys there is a piece of tissue there called a frenulum.  Most cut guys are missing it, but the tissue that is left is ultra sensitive.  So, make sure you really stimulate that area.  3) try some lube and a "twisting motion."    Rock on and have fun yanking.|`|cnk6hHQjaa	just do what you normally do ;-)|`|YYsldZcYaa	Just aim for the dot...|`|TsjqzanQaa	Because of the damage from circumcision, many men have more difficulty achieving orgasm.    Circumcision always damages the penis and destroys 50-75% of sexual sensitivity, usually, and sometimes much more.    The foreskin with its thousands of nerve endings is amputated, other nerves and nerve endings remaining on the penis are permanently damaged, scar tissue is formed, and the normal penile blood flow is permanently disrupted by the removal of the veins and capillaries of the foreskin.    Then, the glans and surrounding tissues meant to be covered by the foreskin dry out and keratinize, and also friction with clothing also toughens the area.       These things all combine to reduce sexual sensitivity and enjoyment, and also reduce the intensity of the victim's orgasms, as well.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|K4zsztkRaa	NOthing is different.      Circumcised guys aren't as sensitive so it takes them longer to finnish.    -Connor|`|CvRscCrjaa	work harder at it. its all in the wrist.|`|1eLZ3Bejaa	Just a quick-tip: You might think you need to be super gentle... but you don't. Sorry if its irrelevant but maybe it still helped a little.|`|48Yf8tpsaa	Practice makes perfect.|`|hSceUVLAaa	ok
