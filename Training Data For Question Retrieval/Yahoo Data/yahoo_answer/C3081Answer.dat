AA10065077	What type of housekeeping experience do you have?<br>  Have you ever been a supervisor before? If yes, how many people worked under you? What were your responsibilities? Where were you a supervisor at and for how long?<br>  Sometimes they will ask for strengths and weaknesses. When naming a weakness you should also tell what your doing to improve that weakness.<br>  Who was your favorite supervisor? They ask this just to get you thinking about your favorite.<br>  Why was this person your favorite? They ask this because most of the time people want to be like there favorite and it gives an idea what you would be like. Don't say because he/she were nice to me, or because they let me get away with... Instead say because they led by example and I knew whatever they asked to do they would do themselves.<br>  Who was your least favorite supervisor? <br>  Why didn't you like them? If it was personal just say that. Most people can understand that you aren't going to get along with everyone. Say something like she would yell at employees in front of other people and you wouldn't do it because you felt it was unprofessional. Whatever you do do not start listing all of their faults like they would come in late and leave early or they were lazy. <br>  During the interview they are also going to see how your people skills are.
