Qp5c6l1Qaa	Do you have a Dave&Busters around? casual food with arcade....instant win|`|kEtYEmhqaa	keep it simple|`|yfPu5pcZaa	I don't live anywhere near you so I don't know what places are around there. You can take her to like an Olive Garden type place. If the date/hangout is going well, then maybe you can take her somewhere else after. Have it planned in mind, just in case. You can take her somewhere cute and romantic if things go well. Maybe the beach or a park with swings at night is super cute. Take a hidden blanket with you hahaha <br>  GOOD LUCK =D|`|GuZzg8rcaa	Make her lunch and go out on a picnic.|`|6627NijZaa	SIZZLERS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS!|`|shiCnpQEaa	go get a slice of pizza now thats hanging out|`|Zjm2S9Xsaa	It depends on your age/income bracket for both of you.<br>  <br>  If you are around 20 and just getting by, I'd consider going to a sort of place where you order at the counter but it's a step up from fast food. Food is made fresh for you. But you eat from real plates, even if you use a tray.<br>  <br>  Like a deli. In Denver that might be Fazoli's (Italian), or the chains Jason's Deli, Fuddruckers. You might also give her a choice of little hole in the wall ethnic stuff. The sort of stuff that is around a college that is student favorites for endless cups of coffee after a meal/dessert.<br>  <br>  Pick the sort of place you'd go with a large group of friends and then hang out afterwards for a period of time. Not someplace where the waitpeople rush you off for efficiency and moving the next group in ASAP. <br>  <br>  If you are a little older, a little financially better off, I'd suggest chains like Bennigans, Chili's, Olive Garden etc.<br>  <br>  The local, cheaper equivalent of Cheesecake Factory (I know a couple but in other cities) is also an option. <br>  <br>  It might also be good to give her a choice of restaurants. "Hey, I know this great Mexican place, or what about Middle Eastern, or this Thai place." Then it is safer to pick places where it isn't generic.<br>  <br>  If you pay upfront for the meal, it might be awkward if you try to cover her meal. Other than saying, hey, I invited you, let me get it. Maybe you could get it some other time.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to make it lean towards a date, paying for her is a good gesture. <br>  <br>  I've started to agree with the articles that say women subconsciously look for men who are providers/financially stable. Even if they are financially stable themselves. Paying for the guy's meal all the time gets tiring. <br>  |`|3uu2bgMuaa	An small Italian sit down spaghetti/pizza type restaurant that isn't to expensive. It will be cute and not very fancy.|`|pluxuSUgaa	Get sprinkles cupcakes and coffee somewhere then go to the beach or something!|`|M2yfeN9Jaa	how about red lobster?|`|fdcEw7YLaa	fast food or a buffet|`|qlziDZl4aa	go to a cafe or coffe shop ie starbucks...|`|XdMxqXvTaa	try red robin... it loud but nice... and not to expensive...|`|gTMPjEG5aa	i think it depends on how old you all are. I cant tell if your 16, in college or middle aged you know? But im in college still and i would take her somewhere larger if the conversations have been a bit awkward already, like places with lots of people but not super loud. Try restaurants that aren't really pricey and fancy so she doesn't feel weird, so its okay to go with ones a little generic to make her feel at ease, like the cheesecake factory would be nice. Places with outdoor patios always help dates go better when you sit outside. PF Changs would be good too, well known but not really generic like TGIF's.
EwL4l2Xnaa	Depends if your good looking or not.  But I always point in pictures at clubs for some reason.. I think I have a good point, nothing personal to anyone.   I just look good doing a drunk war face!<br>  <br>  From a guy standpoint if I pointed at you in a picture at a bar while taking a picture with you it would show respect.. Like damn she's looking hot right now.. Make sense?  Same thing with guys but it would be more like damn he's f****** up!|`|tJw0jnDqaa	depends on their expressions. Eek!

2TQixstDaa	Just back off. Stop playing with her. Don't cut yourself off from her completely, because she'll wonder what's going on, but consciously try to keep yourself firmly in "friend" and out of "boyfriend" territory.<br>  <br>  I hope you at least like her as a best friend. Otherwise, why is she your friend? But if you don't like her romantically, just make that more clear in the way you act around her.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't back off or start treating you more like an ordinary friend, explain to her gently that you want to be her friend, but not her boyfriend. She will probably get angry and not want to talk to you for several days, or even weeks, but if she gets over it then the friendship will be a lot healthier for both of you.<br>  <br>  If she is a "pest" to the boys she likes, she probably needs to develop her relationship skills. When she reaches a higher level of maturity she will be able to have much healthier romantic relationships, but in the meantime, if you like her as a person, be a good friend to her. If you don't like her at all, just tell her that you think you've grown apart, blah blah blah, and you might hurt her but at least you will have helped both of you by getting out of a friendship that wasn't comfortable for you.<br>  <br>  She might need a few rejections in order to change her behavior around guys, who knows. Just be kind to her, even if you don't want to be her boyfriend or even her friend.|`|kiY9kihbaa	First, dates in the 2nd, 3rd and even 6th grade doesn't mean much.  If you play with her, you must like her (just not that way), or you have pity on her or something.  And no one can help you with this, because they've all got the same problems, been through the same problems, or will have the same problems in the future.  And everyone who has had the same problem knows there is no good advice to give on the subject.|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	So, say you're flattered but not interested?<br>  <br>  And try not to make it awkward or avoid her afterward, that's usually what makes rejection painful - not the actual rejection part.<br>  <br>  There isn't a comfortable way out, if that's what you're looking for.|`|hcUjUrVEaa	You're pretty messed up for playing with her.

If I were to give you advice, it will be better for you to continue searching for the person you feel, will love and appreciate what you have to offer as an individual.<br>  <br>  Rather than, chase someone who has made it clear that he doesn't care. <br>  <br>  All men have softer sides, but if for the majority of the time he remains reminding you that he doesn't care it isn't helpful for you remain persuing that in your heart.<br>  <br>  The best advice is to keep the distance between the two of you, and seek the person of your dreams.<br>  <br>  |`|kCj4ZQ4baa	Yes you are in for disaster.

So my advice is never let a guy see you sweat , EVER ! Play it cool go out with your girls have fun basically don't let him know your waiting for his call . Sadly i think he is either not that in to you  just playing the field and doesn't consider you his gf yet (its only been a few dates :) ) or suffering from act like a player itis which is when a guy well acts exactly how you put it . So don't let him play games either he likes you and treats you with respect or you lose his number . Also one night stand relationships dont really work (i could be wrong ) so make them work for it next time . <br>     The fact of the matter is that his issues are in no way your fault and sadly you cant make him act un-douchy . So send him a text asking whats up try to be non clingy and stuff . If he doesn't respond or acts douchy and cold well you have your answer . <br>    You honestly deserve better especially at the beginning of a relationship were you should be having fun . Sorry he is a douche *hugs* whyyyyyyyyyyy are the pretty ones like that . If it doesnt work out dont dwell on it too much there are other guys out there !<br>  So yeah hope this helps ,,,Good luck bud ! <br>  Izzie<br>    |`|ooj1DpLlaa	you are surely in a disaster.<br>  stop seeing him if you feel that he just want contact with you.<br>  talk to him if you really feel that he cares for you.<br>  but i think if he really cares for you,<br>  both of you won't engage in premarital sex, right.<br>  <br>  <br>  i was once like you and got pregnant at the age of 16 and luckily the guy was my husband now and we are happy together.<br>  <br>  <br>  think for the consequences first before you do such thing as that.<br>  do take care yourself first before taking care of your fantasies..|`|gkznEKaNaa	Hey.

c2YcBbXyaa	you should apologize to him. this is a good example of why you shouldn't drink.  it's too bad you met him while you were drunk.  he sounds really nice. think about how much better it could have been under different circumstances. oh well... you screwed up. i hope you didn't get pregnant.|`|PdNE9j6Zaa	i think that saying what you said to him hurt his feelings.<br>  it sounded like he maybe could of been a virgin too and it also sounded like he wanted to be more than a one night stand ..<br>  <br>  talk to him in person so he knows that you dont think he was a huge mistake. dont talk about 'that night' so much, try and talk about other things .. if your seriously into him though. if not then leave him alone ..<br>  <br>  dont act like it was his fault, cause it wasnt .. you WERE there you know, and obviously you wernt drunk enough to not remember cause that was a pretty detailed story.|`|FUoKu13Daa	I think he showed a lot of caring because he kinda felt bad about being your first one.  But it look like you are putting too much stock into this one night thing.  That is why they call it a one night stand because you do what you did and move one,  no commitment and no strings attach, and you look like you are looking for some type of strings with this guy because you gave up something very special to him.<br>  <br>  Ironically you gave it up to a stranger not to someone you been with for awhile, So I am sure you have a lot of emotion that you are not used to dealing with and feeling.<br>  <br>  Talk to the people you are close to like your mom who it seems like you can talk to about things like that to and maybe close friends so you can think straight about this so you will not do something else you might regret later.<br>  <br>  There are going to be time when you are lonely and depressed about your ex or maybe even this guy you might have just slept with but when you do feel these things seek out a good friend because if you end up at a party and you are feeling these things and then you get alchohol in your system and you start to feel good it will be easy to get into another sexual encounter.  So if you do not want this to happen again or if you are not prepared for the outcome then don't drink when you are lonely and depressed.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Don't be so hard on yourself.  You've had sex and far from being a mistake it is just part of growing up.  You are way too young for a serious relationship and you need time to let your emotions and judgement mature.  When you know yourself better you will know exactly who you want and don't want.  Stay away from the guys for a while and let your self grow.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	it really doesn't seem like you had sex he tried and tried but did he really get in and actually fu*k you?  and afterwards he was really nice to you why did you get all freaked out when he was that nice to you?|`|xxTVbFQ2aa	LoL guys are pigs ..."thats hot!" wtf??

He seems like a nice guy and seems to at least have developed some feelings for you after having had sex with you. I'm sure waiting and not having a one night stand would have been better but stuff happens. I think your being very harsh towards him. He didn't do anything wrong. And if you like him why not continue to pursue a relationship with him? Sounds like a mistake happened and your taking it out on a guy who seems to care about you. Granted taking advantage of a girl while shes drunk isn't the best thing in the world, unless it was rape it was only half his fault.|`|adbe30c4db31f92dd2b1cdced05c307baa	Just hope he didn't have a disease and you don't get preggers that would be my first thought, especially for a virgin. Otherwise all you can do is move on and forget about him.  If you are emotionally distraught for loosing your virginity because you had been saving it, well if you are religious say a prayer and forgive yourself.  Everyone makes mistakes of all kinds, just hope for no after affects.|`|lObEjUh1aa	uhm .....<br>  <br>  well you made a mistake, it happens, but hardly seems like the end of the world.  don't drink so much, and use protection next time.<br>  <br>  there's no big mystery as to why he's avoiding you.  you gave him a dirty look; the nonverbal communication is that you want nothing to do with him, so he's just giving you what you nonverbally requested.<br>  <br>  i'm not really sure what the issue is here.  perhaps you can clarify your question?|`|qbImxofYaa	I think you made two huge mistakes.  1) You gave away your most precious virginity while drunk and 2) you made him feel bad about something you allowed to happen when he initially felt honored (as he should have felt.)  He will take you back though, if you want him back.  If not, just be more sensible with your sex from now on.|`|rpgYCVMLaa	Well you were a bit cold towards him after everything he did for you.  He tried to show you respect and make you feel comfortable.  He just wanted to let you know that he wasn't like all the other guys in the world who seem to have sex with a woman and not call them or not even remember who they are.  This guy could have been the ONE for you, but you totally blew him off.  Now you're upset because he doesn't acknowledge you.  If I were you I would be saying sorry to him.  One:  For not telling him you were a virgin before you allowed him to have sex with you.  Two:  For treating him like he was just some random guy you had sex with. And Three:  For being nasty when he actually DID call you afterwards!  This guy sounds amazing, and you're silly for what you did.  If you have lost him, then the fault is naturally your own.  Tell him you're sorry, and if he doesn't forgive you then the fault is still your own.  Give males a chance, because there are some amazing ones out there.|`|sJJojRszaa	Cool, you seem like the one giving him dirty looks and saying you regret it.<br>  So just leave it there, or go out with him, he seems like he really likes you.<br>  <br>  xo|`|w9X1vQ24aa	I think its a life experience and it isnt that bad compared to other things...

A lot of women have lost their virginity in just the same manner. It is just something you will have to live with and maybe one day use yourself as a power of example to your daughter (s) as to what can happen when you over indulge in alcohol and or drugs. Thank God that you did not get pregnant...There aren't many things worse in life than a child that doesn't know his/her father. I know, I looked for years for mine and was sorely disappointed when I found him. Learn from your so called "stupidity" and teach your children well.|`|5ff2ec515a2c5e58d52bea4a22957cadaa	You're the only person that how you lost your virginity should matter too.<br>  <br>  I think you were kind of rude to this Jason guy.....It sounded like he was really trying to be nice to you, respect you, and care about your feelings. It also sounded like he really liked you too.....It also sounds like you may have really hurt his feelings.  You shouldn't have referred to your sexual experience the way you did. You probably offended him and possible made him feel like he wasn't good enough for you. If you had issues with what you did the only one you should be disappointed in is yourself. You want to feel bad about it you feel bad about it but, you shouldn't have made him feel bad about it. As far as I can tell he didn't do anything wrong. You should have let him know you were a virgin from the start.  You also shouldn't put yourself in situations lke you were in if you don't want to do things like you did.  Part of being an adult is acting like one and taking responsibility for your own actions.|`|80JGdWIAaa	First off, you certainly shouldn't take anything he is doing now as something to do with you personally.  They way he is acting is about himself.  He has low self esteem and/or is ashamed of the course of action that he took with you (not ashamed that it was you).<br>  <br>  I think you should just move on from this and acknowledge that you made a little mistake in the grand scheme of things.  If you had a true goal to save yourself for THE ONE, then you can still do that.  There is a difference between having sex (which is what a one night stand is) and making love.  I would expect that you would want to "make love" with THE ONE.  That's what you should be saving.  <br>  <br>  However, I think you should really be careful as to not let yourself have intercourse again until you find THE ONE, if that's what you've been waiting for.  Sometimes when young women have traumatic sexual experiences (or just confusing), they can give up on their morals and become very promiscuous.  I'm sure you wouldn't want to look back and see the path you took if that's what you ended up doing.<br>  <br>  Just relax.  You have nothing to worry about.  So you had a little mishap.  Remember your goals and stick to them.  Please don't blame yourself for how that guy is behaving, it actually sounds like he's probably embarrassed, but confused about whether he should be or not.<br>  <br>  He might be embarrassed because he couldnt get the job done... This was probably due to mental pressure he had because he had just learned that you were a virgin... He's probably feeling embarrassed (he couldnt do it), ashamed (he couldnt do it & he messed with your virginity, he let you down with your first time- even though the first time is never glamorous!) and confused (thinking... she doesnt know what it's like, so maybe I don't need to be embarrassed).|`|AA12378109	Dont listen 2 them <br>  i  know how u feel <br>  how dare they just say move on or thats life <br>  Im so sry i know how u feel something similar sorta happened 2 me!!<br>  if u like u can email me <br>  take care and hope the best 4 u|`|B9Y1DlLpaa	Nice horny ****.<br>  <br>  Next time u sleep wid a guy tell him ur a virgin n ur hymen tore tryin to play basket ball..<br>  <br>  he wud buy that<br>  <br>  btw answering ur question<br>  <br>  I think nuthin o it|`|bnbi2EP0aa	i think you handled the situation poorly. sorry, but it's true.  you kept putting down what happened.  you made it seem that he had done something wrong.  he showed interest in you and in your family, but you let him know that both you and your family were disapointed in him.  of course he felt like an outsider and maybe even ashamed, so he ran away...<br>  <br>  i know it must hurt your feelings, and i'm sorry, but you asked.|`|nFwf6vkdaa	usually i dont read this much; but i read it all.. !<br>  dont regret you told him that.because thats what you felt.dont ever regret your acts.it makes you inconfident, big mistake. you had sex with him, because you didnt know him that well and look what he is doing to you. but thats ok. thats just life, thats just going to make you grow,and be more mature, it hurts you know. but give time to time.and try to talk to him. just dont beg or seem needy just talk to him say hi.blah blah blah.to see whats on his mind.but to tell you the truth thats the same thing that happen to me when i was 18 same same thing. i use to cry,feel like shyt.and, regret. i got crazy i went to the hospital couple weeks later to see if i got hiv, or gotten pregnant herpes.or any STD's i was driving my self crazy. dont do that to your self i see your despret your askin for peoples opinions on yahoo.but let it be dont regret it. in the moment you had a good time. so. who cares. it was going to happen one day!. be safe take care of yourself and dont drink! so you dont mess up again.|`|u2NlZ8eeaa	easy this guy is for u thats why we he found out u were saving ur virginity he kinda stopped and didnt finish because he probably wanted ur real first time to be special that why he didnt try anything again this dude probably is one of those few good guys like me u should try and get him back please answer mine <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsPiaQGxGpWj5wAgQfNM7u3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081217010023AACg74h">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
uLeXGHnKaa	I dunno, I'm a girl and I think sex is very important. I love having it, I think about it when I'm not, and yes I absolutely need to be satisfied.<br>  <br>  I think the two main differences with women is that we see sex differently and our mechanism for getting turned on works differently. For women, yes sex is something awesome and hot and fun and feels amazing, but it's also highly tied in with our emotions (I'm sure this is not the case for some women but it is for alot of them) Sex may not exactly equate to love, but it causes a heavy rush of feelings for the person we have it with, which is probably why women may not want to just have sex given the opportunity.<br>  <br>  Also, sex is different for us. With guys they pretty much just have to see something they think is hot to get turned on, and it really doesn't take much to get them off. With women it takes more to get them ready, and the skill of the guy can really alter the experience, so it's not just like we're looking for a penis; a guy has to know how to use it to really make it worthwhile haha.<br>  <br>  Another thing is that if we have sex with lots of people society tends to stigmatize us, so women are much less open about having sex and their desire for it, and would be less likely to just jump at the opportunity.<br>  <br>  That being said, yes women can go long periods of time without sex, and so can guys if they have to, it doesn't mean we don't want it or we're not taking care of ourselves. I think it just takes more for girls to be satisfied by sex or to get turned on, which is why they might stop really wanting to have sex after being in a relationship for a long time. I know for me, the more I have sex the more I want to have it, and the less I have it the less I think about it. I'm sure it's not the same for all women, but I at least know a couple who feel that way.|`|5jceEq9gaa	yes, ask my mom's friend|`|FS8AH01Maa	not if they meet me<br>  <br>  weeoooooo|`|Is5iWTNdaa	they are called nuns|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	Boys can too.<br>  <br>  How healthy that is for your mental health (for either gender) is subject to question.<br>  <br>  It's just that in Amerikanzi land, the socially ideal is a girl who doesn't have sex, a virgin.

lObEjUh1aa	It was an awesome present!<br>  <br>  Sadly, we men are notoriously bad at expressing appreciation.  I bet your boyfriend is sitting at home right now, thinking "wow, I got an AWESOME birthday present; my girlfriend is so loving and creative."  Chances are he doesn't even realize how bad you feel right now (I know, we're kindof clueless when it comes to this sort of thing).<br>  <br>  Let him know (in a non-accusatorial way) that you really need some expressions of appreciation and love as you put a lot of thought into this gift and really wanted him to be happy.  I'm sure he'll be happy to show you some love and appreciation as soon as he realizes that's what you need.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps; good luck!|`|jV7MzX7naa	well maybe you should call hem and ask him if he is ok...<br>  or just talk to him<br>  if he doesn't like that it doesn't give him the reason to not talk to you<br>  he must not be that great of a boyfriend if he won't even thank you for it<br>  (just my opinion) but my opinion doesn't really matter for ur question<br>  i just say call him to see if he is ok or not... you could go to his house to see if he is ok too but calling may be better<br>  <br>  hope that helped|`|yeAO0tQ7aa	sounds awesome, dear.<br>  <br>  Idk why he hasnt called, maybe he is spoiled, not to sound harsh but what a prick!

I wish someone would've given me that :D No no no that's an amazing present. Any boyfriend should realize that. I think while you are over reacting a little, he should have the sense and courtesy to call you and thank you for such a caring present. I would be pissed too but try calling him and tell him how upset you are. If you just let him make you angrier, things will get worse. Give him a call and ask him what he thought of it and tell him how upset you are that he hasn't called because you miss him. :) hope this helps. That's what I would do.|`|dF08mbFyaa	it sounds like it took you 3 seconds to put together that gift. he might be offended and think that you forgot and pulled it together at the last minute. maybe if you had made him a little basket with some themed gifts (spa, movie night, etc.) and put the coupons inside it might have seemed like a better thought out gift. however, there could be something else up. why don't you just call and find out whats up? don't call with any preconceptions and DON'T sound mad. just ask if he would like to redeem one of his coupons. or maybe just asked how he liked them. make sure that you let him know that he hurt you and why, but don't accuse him of anything and be ready to listen to HIS feelings too. <br>  Good luck! xoxo|`|Pkx3V92faa	Haha it is the Holidays i'm sure he's just busy!

I remember went i did the same thing that you did. I called my boyfriend to ask him what he thought of his gift.  He told me that he felt bad that he couldn't do anything that cool because he wasn't that creative for my birthday so he tried to give back something similar to me for my next birthday and now we are married and have a daughter together.  Remember that most men are not creative like you and are more into spending money to go out for the easy way to satisfy your wishes on your birthday. All you are doing is showing your love for him and don't expect anything back until given. If he does give something back act like you weren't expecting a thing and it makes him feel worthy of you.
FS8AH01Maa	just be honest!<br>  tell him you were going to be late to class.  He'll understand, its not like you just ignored him for no reason, im sure he wouldnt want to make you late for class, that would make you mad and make him feel even worse.  just talk to him about it, it really seems like no big deal, i wouldnt worry too much about it, even if he gets mad he'll get over it.<br>  As a guy, we tend not to hold that many grudges, especially with our girlfriends, unless they cheat on us.|`|gy87Nxqeaa	I am sure that he will get over it.

Maybe, she wants something that you're not giving her.  Send her some flowers at work with a sweet note.  Then, when she comes home, tell her that there's something on your mind that you want to talk about.  Simply tell her that you love her very much and can't help but to spend more time with her.  Ask her what you can do to make that happen.  (If she's like me, she'll think about it and then realize that she's the one who needs to make changes.)  <br>  <br>  Also, I completely understand that you're feeling like she's always putting you down.  A lot of husbands feel that way.  My mom is that way toward my dad.  It's probably somewhere along the lines of emotional abuse.  Honestly, it's probably not you.  It's probably has to do with something at work.  Ask her about her day and ask her if any thing is on her mind.  I really hate to say this, but sometimes, there is nothing you can do but to take it and know that even though it hurt you it probably helped her relieve stress.  Just be extra sweet to her so that she feels guilty, and maybe, someday, she'll stop.  <br>  <br>  Also, I wouldn't recommend suggesting this in the heat of an argument, but maybe, she needs counseling for her mood swings.  You might want to suggest going to a marriage counselor.  (not for you but for her but don't tell her this)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!     |`|V1JyuYg8aa	I know for me as a woman, environment is very important to serious conversations like the one you need to have with your woman. Is this an issue for your wife? Ask her on a walk or make dinner for her when she comes home from work and sit down talking about her day and then bring up the topic after you wash the dishes and clean up. You need to show her that you understand how hard she is working and appreciate her, that way she will be open to your feelings (Seek first to understand, then to be understood, Stephen Covey). Ask her how she feels about the relationship, is there something that she is missing, and be prepared to answer without being defensive. Be honest and open. Have you gained weight, is she no longer attracted to you? Have you bought her some flowers lately? Do you have financial problems and she feels insecure? I would recommend reading 2 books that have helped me prepare for my soon marriage, and helped us understand each other better. "His Needs, Her needs" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/His-Needs-Her-Building-Affair-Proof/dp/0800717880/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1228851206&sr=1-5" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/His-Needs-Her-Buil...</a><br>  and we've enjoyed several books by the author of "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus", but now I would recommend this one "Why Men and Women Collide?" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mars-Venus-Collide-Relationships-Understanding/dp/B001GVJBIE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1228851403&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Mars-Venus-Collide...</a><br>  I hope you will sort this out and she will understand you.

I had a day-time schedule and his was swings, so we hardly ever saw each other. I had grubby old men and stupid young boys at work constantly hitting on me, even though they knew that I was married. My ex is good-looking, highly intelligent, and a kind person. He is an ingineer where I used to work but in another town. So why would I go lower than him?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I usually would get 5 or 6 hours of sleep so I was even more edgy and was easily annoyed. My ex kept on pestering me on what was wrong, and it had gotten to the point that I would take off to the market or find other things to do just to avoid him. We ended our relationship when he decided to listen to other people on leaving me.<br>  <br>  Now you have an idea of my former situation. I suggest that you shouldn't pester her and ask her when it is the best time to talk to you about some issues. If she askes what your issues are still feeling edgy, just tell her what they are about but don't go one explaining. Think it this way--a brief list. Throw in marriage counseling if considering.<br>  <br>  The one thing you must NEVER, EVER do is going around telling everyone in the neighborhood, families, friends, and co-workers the details of your fights. This was the breaking point for me. I can understand telling them to your counselor and doctors but not others.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way: would you like everyone to know about details of your fights and gossip about them to others? It is considered posioning the well. Once someone gets some juicy details, then about 30 or 40 others would a missed detail or modified ones along the way to the next ear. After my divorce, most of my friends and most family members were shocked that I was divorced but didn't get more than what I just mentioned. However, everyone whom my ex knew already knew more than I wanted them to know.
zycEjQKNaa	It sounds like she likes you. She just want to see about you first. Like hang out a few times outside of school. JUST hang out nothing official. Then see how things go. I would not just dive in right away. Who knows maybe she doesn't get the signals. I know I am really bad at that kind of stuff. I would let her get to know you first and hang out a few times so that way its not so awkward for the first date, because it really sounds like she likes you.|`|daH1hoJ2aa	aw CUTE<br>  no she totally sounds interested but she's probably shy or nerveous take it slow :)<br>  good luck |`|as9yKqmzaa	shes interested|`|Z2NLFBOFaa	No, she's not.|`|W3Zy0yj0aa	She proballlyy wants more, but maybe she just doesn't like coffee :P<br>  <br>  Try and talk to her more and find out what she really likes doing and stuff, and asking her to do something she enjoys, shows you were listening and you actually remembered!!<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|Aky55dCpaa	Be a dude. Ask her out.|`|cgtM51wMaa	i think she kinda likes u but maybe shes not sure if u like her so she doesnt wana make it obvious|`|M11nx95paa	well u won't really get to know until u talk to her..thing is no matter wat anyone on this blog says, truth is, she's the one that holds the answer u r looking for...ask her, should be easy coz u guys r friends n so r comfortable with each other... in the event she doesn't like u in that way, think of it this way, at least u acquired a good friend and now u knw inste of tormenting urself wit the "wat if?" question<br>  <br>  good luck |`|qyRrxLs3aa	Thats a hard one, it seems like she just might like soaking up the attention you give her. I say back off a little bit and dont initiate anything with her. If she asks why your being that way just tell her that you liked her but didnt feel like she was interested and take it from there. If she doesnt say anything at all to you then you know she doesnt care about you. 
I6dcRgD6aa	This has nothing to do with her. This has to do with you. Are you confindent that your b/f wants you & not anyone else? If not then you have a problem & if it isn't her it will be someone else. I told my husband that if he ever found anyone better than me then I just want him to tell me & I would understand. We have been married over 30 years. You have to be confindent that you are the best. It will be funny to see her make a fool out of herself......|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	What does your boy friend say?|`|xUy7B5vDaa	Be the better person. Talk to your boyfriend about it so your both aware of her shi* stirring etc and if you can... be nice to her! That will pee her off badly and make you look even better to your boyfriend. Instead of slagging her off to your boyfriend why not try a different approach... i.e i think its sad that she is like that etc etc....|`|uVy8yEjLaa	just ignore her.if he wanted to be with her he would be.|`|jkH2xtIcaa	Ask her to back off ,she must leave your bf<br>  If that don't work then hell yeah beat her up|`|ea599a3bab257d34bbe640e49222c626aa	if ur guy truely likes u ten he will b always ter wit u...n if ur feelings r true ten dnt worry for anythng...|`|lObEjUh1aa	try to accept the fact that your boyfriend is an independent person and will make his own decision.  a person is not a belonging, and a relationship is not something you can own.  if you think about it, no one can stop you from dumping him if you find a better match.  by the same token, you cannot stop him from dumping you if he finds a better match.<br>  <br>  just be who you are and let him decide for himself.|`|7kSeNyAAaa	No, you shouldn't.<br>  Why would you resort to violence over some dude?<br>  It's not her choice anyway...it's his and if he wants to be with her than that's his choice.  If he wants to be with you..that's his choice.<br>  On the flip side it's your choice as to whether you want him as your boyfriend also.<br>  I would just ignore her.  It takes two to tango and if he's not interested than it will not be.|`|5iavzT1Baa	Why are you angry with this girl? And violence only makes you look mentally unstable and low class like trailer trash. I would just let her try for your boyfriend, if your boyfriend goes, he isnt worth it and its best to know things like this early on. Good luck.|`|ZBMHCC4taa	yea shes right she could be telling the truth but id say like tell ur bf and if he still goes for her then you know he wasn't worth it if he loves you like he says he does you have nothing to worry about...|`|jsRdCGE5aa	Well, if your relationship is solid w. your "man" then you shouldn't worry that much.|`|KpO4UtElaa	nah, she's not worth it.. just ignore her and she'll move on eventually. i hate girls like that.|`|2A419Xq3aa	kick her A**! or shoot her with a gun in the alley|`|r42DhVoNaa	well i dont want to give u bad advice but if it was my situation i would do it. lol but im a lover and a fighter<br>  <br>  Casanova|`|5wsqHYyvaa	I dealt with the same thing at a wedding .... there was a bridesmaid (my boyfriend the groomsmen that walked her down the isle) You just need to smile and let her be jealous. You and your boyfriend's relationship should be close enough not to trust her lies. Communicate with him and let him know her intentions. Once she sees that you two are in it for good - and he isn't and wont be interested, it'll pass and she'll no longer be an issue. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind: He chose YOU. Even though it may be difficult, still smile and be nice to her. Kindness kills.|`|tgMp35yzaa	tell her straight that you are with him and untill that girl gets it into her tiny little head ***** slap that girl. obviously your man wants you other wise he would have already left you for her! keep your guy happy and make sure he knows how much you love him.<br>  <br>  if hes the kinda guy i think he is then you are a lucky girl and you should make him understand that. <br>  <br>  dont listen to that snobby cow. <br>  <br>  good luck hun x|`|CoeNg8BMaa	Yeah, and then what?<br>  <br>  Dont beat her just take your guy to her and let him Speak and be a man. ask him to tell her in front of you that she's acting like a fckn snob and she needs to stop all this **** hole acting and lies spreading|`|iirKnKsgaa	NO you are better than that , if he is worth having he will not be swayed by her and stay true to you.<br>  If he is having his head turned by other girls then he does not deserve to be with you.<br>  ignore her and concentrate on YOUR life and education.<br>  everything has a way of working out in time|`|ZMTmdiv2aa	You should lay down the law on her.  Tell you aren't going to put up with it.  If you see her in the cafeteria, you should go up to her and hit her tray so that her lunch is all over the ground.  That will teach her a lesson.|`|MKRHnrudaa	look out for whats yours<br>  hes your bf tell her to f off<br>  thats what i would want my gf to do<br>  but i love her and would tell that biatch to f off my self<br>  if a guy comes near my gf<br>  i **** snap cause shes my girl <br>  <br>  PROTECT WHATS YOURS <br>  just dont kill her and go on a massacre|`|BRMKkAXqaa	all ill say is don't listen to her.just watch ur back though she could be tellin the truth.|`|75jz10Vraa	ask straight your "man" who he really loves....<br>  i think that would do to shut her up...
qcgGnDgJaa	Bad boy honestly something about the danger feeling just makes the guy totally hotter. Also bad boys are more unaprogible it least most of them and the whole "i can't have him' feeling makes alot of women like the guy more. But I think the relationships get old and the whole crush comes down real fast. It is hard to like a guy that doesn't have the best personality even if he has the danger factor. Do good guys tend to be sweeter, more romantic, and overall a better chooice. I think I perfer guys that seem dangerous not so much in crime but just have that whole danger vibe but are sweet but still can suprise you. Hope I helped|`|83oULw1Caa	I'd like someone who loves me. And someone with humanity.<br>  You can't classify someone as good or bad just like that. Everyone in this world has a bad side and a good side. There are wonderful people in this world who are a little bit filthy if you can get over it and see the wonderful side life would be good.<br>  <br>  And you are always attracted to someone you know you can never be with. Its the same with everybody.|`|mTqyVi42aa	well let me put it this way. girls like guys that are unpredictable. so bad boys have an advantage there. but they also like the guys who are not jerks and know how to treat them respectfully. so that's where the do gooders come in. i would find a happy middle. or even better. just be yourself!|`|AA12055307	ok, this is going to kind of sound bad, but i like the guy i can't have.. whether it be good guy or bad guy, it's the playing hard to get that drives me insane.|`|iLQB3hDnaa	do good. Im 13. people who want bad boys are people who look bad or act bad or who dont want a stable life. a Mr. do good is GOOD hence the word...|`|D4Rcvjjtaa	i like the kind of guy who would be a bad boy <br>  but would always do good by me|`|8KMdXKTLaa	I prefer mr good...bad boys are just little boys whining for attention|`|gfb1p7Saaa	do good|`|vDYfxtTaaa	i prefer both. I want a guy who will love, care, and hold me tight but then break the rules a couple of times or more teehee|`|YfoYgjB0aa	not TOO goody goody, but not too much of a bad boy...so somewhere in btwn is good...confidence is key tho lol cockiness just ruins it....|`|hcntJv0Jaa	I prefer the guy who is good and honest but I know deep down there is a bad boy and only I get to see it! :P|`|Eq7V6OO0aa	I prefer the in the middle type.<br>  A guy that has a bad side, but knows when to use it.|`|8U23iLKVaa	mr. do good type. because i think those are the ones who would want to be in a serious relationship. and i love those :)|`|Hqu5JuIUaa	these girls lying.<br>  <br>  im hood as s h i t and all the girls be playin me like they dont want any|`|CzZdBRBpaa	it would be good if the guy was nice.<br>  but not to nice because he would<br>  let her get away with evrything, SO BOTH.|`|zhrakR9Aaa	Bad Boy type def.|`|9Kzvxu2Maa	do god i want some one sweet and kind someone i can trust|`|J86lIDnWaa	a little of both|`|efgP4jiHaa	the best of both worlds!|`|VBdXray0aa	Bad boys are always fun for a little while.<br>  Mr. Do Good .. well, maybe|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Neither.

X0BrFsfSaa	a friend who has hurt u before defintly because that means u just had some differnces. if ur friend doesnt trust u then that means ur not real friends.
2BEMSGPdaa	Next time you go on a date take an extra pair of pants with you and tell him to try to get into them.|`|a4af826ed304c1b46a4b7d3d32267631aa	Hey that good that you are saying no to him. You should just keep saying no. If he keep trying to get in your pants you should just break up with him. Also you should try talking to him and tell him you are not that way so stop trying to get in my pants. If he say no break up with him. Also you should talk to your mother about she may can help you more with this.|`|O0D9GtElaa	If thats all he wants to do then break up with him.  But if you really like him then stay with him and keep saying no.  i also think you should have a conversation with him about him knowing that he is not going to get in your pants and f he can accept that then great, but if not then break it off with him.|`|4MkI2hAkaa	hon, you're 13. You don't need anything like this right now. You should be focusing on school, friends, and your life - not an over-aggressive bf. Seriously, tell him no is you're final answer, and if he pushes it again, break up.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	Just tell him no and if he wont stop then dump his sorry a$$. If he wont move his hand a proper punch in the mouth will help him understand it's not his to play with.|`|2bmNvf40aa	UMMMMM....break up with him. You are too young to have a boyfriend anyways!!! Its really sad that adolescences are being pressured to do sexual things so early!!! Don't give in you will just regret it!!!|`|CBSRliJVaa	Break it off.<br>  <br>  Obviously, he does not respect your limits.<br>  And why would you date someone who didnt respect you like that?|`|oBk1bD1yaa	just tell him, if he truly likes you he will stop, if hes a pig, then he just wants sex and he'll break up with you. you shouldnt feel uncomftorble like that, its wrong.
QiCTYS48aa	hmm|`|wJGQtHuhaa	hell 2 the no! he cant be ur friend and then drop u when its convenient 4 him. its either ur friends or ur not. he chose not. simple as that|`|RWI8Rxnhaa	hunnie i think you should give him a second chance, wouldnt you want one too?|`|aroRl6jsaa	no way! even though you moved away for a while he moved on too fast he seems like a jerk!
1Z0Lmrk1aa	Your boyfriend is very selfish and I am available, lol. Seriously, something must be amiss with him. Either he's fallen out of love with you or he's addicted to masturbation, which makes no sense. If I had a woman who wanted to make love every day I would be grateful and give it to her. You should get rid of the guy if he doesn't change.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Stacey, if you marry him then expect more of the same in the bedroom.|`|RILZcr6Daa	Look for me|`|c5cd0335ee42a5ea6e90bf0c236232e4aa	its crazy if any guy prefers to mastubate over doing it with a women, hell i wish i could have sexd everyday but unfortnately my women dosent like it everyday, but every other day...perhaps one gotta think of other ideas without hurting one partners cause hurting someone is just not right, i would say if its not working mutually then perhaps people should part in a decent manner and be friends whilst serching for the right and mutual feelings.
9BtA5Knfaa	For some reason good girls like bad boys! sorry bro, maybe TRY to be just a little bit bad and see where that gets you!|`|HMhUKAgkaa	You're just meeting the wrong girls hun. You gotta try finding a girl at church or something. You'll find her. Don't give up! :)|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	Girls like excitement.  Try to be more out going and relaxed around girls.|`|lObEjUh1aa	1.  first, stop comparing yourself to other men.  they have their strengths (and weaknesses), and you have yours.<br>  <br>  2.  remember, every woman's favorite subject is herself (sorry girls, but i think it's true).  give her sincere complements, make her feel important, and show her a lot of attention.  make her feel safe, and make her a priority.  these things are all huge ego boosters for women, and have a massive impact on how they feel about you.  in fact, how she feels when you are around is usually how she will feel about you -- so if she loves the way she feels about herself when you are around, then she will love you.  your job is to make her love the way she feels about herself.<br>  <br>  3.  don't fight gravity.  no matter how attractive (or unattractive) you are, some women will be into you and some simply won't.  those who don't respond to your advances just aren't into you, and you're wasting your time to pursue anything.  let them go and move on to the next one.|`|AA10500388	I am a girl who always goes for the a**holes. why i don't know. I guess because the constant arguments or whatever are exciting but to be honest it's true what they say nice guys finish last but they do indeed finish i have a nice guy and im happy with him being plain. There is a girl out there who will appreciate you and treat you the way you should be treated ...forget the chick that dissed you you're probably too good for her anyway|`|5gqc5qyzaa	I know, it's a shame the lassies all seem to like the complete retards, but they also like confidence. Just be happy with yourself and if you like you, others will too. Eventually it'll pay off for ya.|`|XDKAJ8wOaa	I think one of your biggest problems is the fact that you even have to ask the question.  One of the most attractive qualities to anyone (male or female) is confidence.  As long as you feel like there is something wrong with you, or you are not good enough, you will always be "just a friend".  You have to understand that you are a great person, and deserve to be in a great relationship.  Once you develop that, girls will notice and you will be getting dates like crazy.|`|Ak4048jUaa	Haha...I hear ya! How old are you? That has a lot to do with it. In high school, all the girls want to hard asses and guys who are punks and popular. Later on in life, the "smart" girls (who you want) will start to notice the smart guys. You will find someone. Don't stress. Enjoy your single life while you can! :)|`|s6KxfDF6aa	It is the way it is...<br>  Girls are too complex dude<br>  they love mystery..<br>  all good ... nice mamma's boy is what a girl needs when she wants to marry not when she is going around having fun so just try to be yourself when you are with a girl.. dont loose your dignity or importance in front of her... value and respect yourself, girls will automatically follow...<br>  <br>  and one more thing there's nothing wrong if you are not all good.. girls dont like tht anyways..|`|RJkYRaccaa	your day will come, my friend...<br>  <br>  young girls are dumb, they always want the bad boys... sheesh, so do some of the older ones, but eventually they realize that you can't change the bad boy and he will always be that way, and wait a minute, maybe a nice guy would be better.<br>  <br>  <br>  just keep bein yourself. you'll find your dream girl... eventually. <br>  in the mean time, keep yourself occupied with friends, and don't stress on relationships!!|`|cLEsSjgAaa	awww.<br>  thats so sad!<br>  you know, one of my friends said the same thing<br>  "why do the wrong guys get all the girls, but the good guys get nothing".. WELL<br>  thats not nessisarly true.<br>  you'll find that special girl for you sooner or later.<br>  you just have to wait. dont let one girl bring you down. she<br>  obviously has bad taste with guys. :)<br>  just stay confident. good luuuck<br>  :]|`|OBuUW8vQaa	I think that it's just that the other boy have been there a LONG time and he have grown on to her and your just not that same.she probly wont you to be just like him but no one is that same so just forget about her.|`|AA10315531	Life's not fair. Girls like that mostly will learn their lesson and come back to nice guys. But you don't need a girl like that. I would stop looking and may be one will surprise you in the future. :)|`|PrpKUgHeaa	Girls are hard to figure out sometimes. Just look for another one, there are a lot of them out there...|`|d8h4RXi3aa	dont worry dude..good things happen after a while :) it takes time and wait for "the ideal time" ...im sure things will work out good :)|`|v5lHF79faa	she's out there sweetie. girls are just dumb sometimes. we don't really know what we want. you'll find her : ] good luck.

lKsoOqndaa	You need to talk to her and tell her that she's changed, and that she's not the girl you fell in love with.<br>  Tell her you want a relationship of real love, not physical love.. you need to give her your limitations! Besides, she may just be losing control because to the rape. But DO NOT mention the rape when you talk to her! It will just make things go wrong.<br>  <br>  Tell her you're jealous of the guys she flirts with. Believe me, girls like it when their boyfriend gets jealous of other guys. It will make her feel special and loved.<br>  <br>  I hope everything goes well!|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	tell her that you don't like the way that she is acting. and tell her that she NEEDS to get help, rape victims easily develop emotional problems.|`|XADP739faa	uhmm make sure she's not using you for things, and she should understand if you're not ready. make sure she doesn't rape you either.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	Rape affects people differently. Sometimes the reaction happens right away, or it could start months or even years after the rape took place. Sometimes there's not that much reaction. Sounds like something has 'set her off' and she's beginning to act out by pressuring you for sex. Tell her how you feel. I hope that her parents know about the rape and that she's seeing a counselor. If she continues to pressure you, it would probably be best for you to split up with her. You want to be there for her, but you are 14 and you should not be in a position where you have to be her support. That should be her parents job. You can't change her. She can only do that for herself.|`|ohPCrRJ6aa	Coming from a 13 year old girl, shes fcked up in the head. She thinks sex will make things good. The factt that she was raped means shes most likely unstable, and tgis is gonna keep happening. Brah i think you should openly talk to her, and say your not ready and she shouldnt be either. You cant be ready for sex at 14, its that simple.|`|oYH7toWWaa	have u considered putting her to sleep?<br>  its very humane and really the best thing to do. kill her.<br>  <br>  IM JOKING im not sure i think she feels less sexual about the rape but then every might of been saying to her, i know your never gonna have sex again because u got raped but she might be trying to disproove them|`|9bff09b4ef3b32723c10525b90414f65aa	for sure you should talk to her about it.<br>  i mean she probably doesn't even realize the way she is if u don't mention it to her. <br>  <br>  if she doesn't realize even after you tell her, then just drop it. sh'e snot worth it.<br>  <br>  ur a good guy, girls shouldn't be like that|`|2efUNOEEaa	dude i know u want to stay wit her but its high school<br>  better opportunity  lie out in the world she's probably advanced in her mind and ur not ready . my friends has the same problem expect their doing it . it sickens me when kids do it.|`|vwXCiCxdaa	well just talk about it and just be like im not ready to have sex.|`|3jHL5rQ7aa	confront her and tell her ur real feelings about how she is . if she doesnt want to change then maybe u will find another perfect girl just 4 u|`|mewgbdd0aa	Talk to her and let her know that you need to know what has happened. Ask her if anything out of the ordinary has happened or if she's being pressured by her friends to "do it". I don't know why in the world you don't want to take this opportunity since these occasions don't come by often. Maybe its because she trusts you enough, or because she feels like it will be a gift or something, just make sure you don't **** up, because if you come out telling her in an offensive way she might feel insecure or sluttish. Don't think that she's being slutty, as long as shes only acting like this around you.|`|vM8QTupsaa	I hate to say it but no. Rape changes you. It has obviously made her sexual. It takes time for the realization of what happen to sink in, it seems like it finally has for her. Talking to her might help but she will never be the same again. I was raped when I was 13 also by my best friends boyfriend. I turned into a slut also but I am now 15 and I am back to normal but still pretty sexual. I hope things work out for you.|`|ZBwZT04naa	There is nothing YOU can do to change her back.  That's going against human nature.  Any change will have to come from the inside.  The best thing for you to do is to break up, but you don't want to do it.  So, you are saying that you don't want to do the best thing that you should.  So, who can possibly help you?  Ask again when you're ready to do whatever it takes.|`|DEgVSsllaa	I'm afraid that people can never really go back in time. But talk to her about it. Tell her that you aren't comfortable and that you don't want to have sex. And if she starts to pressure you into sex or anything else you aren't comfortable with... well, my advice would be to break up with her. As much as that might hurt, if she's just trying to use you, then you'd be better without her.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped. =D|`|000f9d6657600c8a5f4dcb9a210606e7aa	I think something might have triggered her to remember the rape and she might want to forget it by remembering it with you or something to that effect. why don'tyou talk to her about it ...its hard but don't ask her why she's slutty but ask her if anything is different in her life...|`|CyBkQ5DYaa	first of all..it is really hard to find guys lyk u..dats mostly wat guys think about now days and i respect you for dat..you should tell her how you feel..and i feel really bad she got raped..dats sad..dont change 4 sum gurl..ik about dis i same age as u|`|WOQfob6naa	i think your acting weird. smash that pussy. its about time for you to get some ***. i lost my virginity when i was 12..

She wants to have a hand, or maybe a leg or two, up in this case on everyone else. She wants to know that she is in the loop with everyone else and wants to know that her peers look up to her. I'm a girl and I remember going through this age and wanting to explore what sex is etc... you want to know that you aren't a freak of nature...<br>  <br>  Kudos for not wanting to have sex yet.. .it is a decision you won't forget... Tell her you don't want to and if she gets mad then she's not worth it.. I'm sorry... <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|f2V3eZj6aa	so my friend was totally normal until she got into the dating buisness and then she got really slutty and wanted to do it with her boyfriend but she decided not to at the last moment. she has been uber horny ever since and she want to make out with every guy she meets and it kinda sounds like this just happened to your poor girlfriend. i dont think she can change back unless you 2 break up. maybe she has a friend who is getting the idea into her mind that you 2 need to have sex? there is many possibilities but i do not thinksh   can change  back while going out with u.|`|AA11446818	omg U SOUND LIKE THE PERFECT BOYFRIEND GO OUT WITH ME !!!!<br>  but in case that doesnt work out..<br>  this slutty thing shes doing is obviously a cover for the fact that shes insecure. she thinks thats what she has to do to be accepted and "cool" and shes obviously had to grow up very quickly and deal with a lot-being raped and all. so tell her how u feel, maybe shes doing it impress u. tell her once n for all youre not ready n if she continues, find someone who is more like you. youre 14, and will go out with a looooooong line of girls before u die|`|YqZ3OmWQaa	tell her how you feel<br>  you'll get a lot of that im sure<br>  but its true<br>  tell her your not comfortable with going further<br>  and you value the both of you toomuch to want that righ tnow<br>  your too young, which is very true,<br>  just dont give in,<br>  if she doesnt like it,<br>  she may not be righjt for you,<br>  at 15, girls are gonna go through a lot of changes,<br>  and i dont mean like, <br>  physical changes,<br>  but they are going to start getting their own personality<br>  and making decisions for themselves<br>  thier personality will start coming out a lot more,<br>  so, this may just be the new "her"<br>  which prolly isnt the greatest thing<br>  but you never really know<br>  just talk to her about it<br>  thats all i can say,<br>  and good luck|`|fb3UXag9aa	k. im just sayign right now thi smay not happned to you like it did to me. I had the same problem. slutty gf wanted me too much. I told her listen. im not ready for sex, slow down or we are gonna have to break up. If she really loves you she will tak eit slow. ME and my gf were splitzville after that. But she was also the biggest slut in school so no worries with u and ur gf lol|`|QmpobMj7aa	After a girl has sex for the first time she usually wants to become more sexually active. Whether it was a pleasant experience or not.<br>  <br>  And if she's as 'developed' as you say she is...well...hit it. XD<br>  Get some condoms from your pops and trust me...you'll become more 'sexually active' after your first time too. =D|`|hMMU02iuaa	It sounds to me like she is emotionally-damaged. Her being raped has most likely caused her to act this way. She probably thinks she is unworthy and trashy and deserves what happened to her. Your job is to talk to her. Tell her how much you care for her and let her know that you will be there for her no matter what. As uncomfortable as it sounds, you will have to bring up the rape. You have to explain to her that what happened is not her fault and she needs to trust that you won't hurt her or pressure her for sex. Make her feel your love for her. She needs you now more then ever.
4yoe9eAaaa	internet chats sometimes can involve alot of intrigue and fantasy...men many times wrongly assume you will join in and then complain when you don't comply.  Personally I have felt it disrespectful to assume that erotica-talk is expected, like some kindof party-line.  <br>  They go too far many times without any clue or hint from your end.  you were right in letting him know how you felt but you must allow for the reaction.  <br>  If you're not comfortable, he should adjust to that, yet instead he reacted in a little boyish fashion. He cannot be mature enough for you in my opinion.|`|Lfn2LOTzaa	The entire point of flirting because you are interested in someone more than friendship. That does not just mean sex for ppl. who have said that. He may have genuinely wanted a relationship to start or date you.<br>  Then you rejected him. After talking to him all winter long.<br>  Did he really not make his feelings clear from the beginning?<br>  If you didn't reciprocate any of his advances then he is wrong in being mad. But he still has a reason to feel rejected and not want to be around you.<br>  It is not easy to be around someone you like that does not feel the same way. Whether because of rejection of not. <br>  If I have feelings about someone else's girlfriend I won't want to be around them. If it's an ex-girl that I still like in a way but things were not good between us it can be hard.<br>  Either way, ppl. usually don't want to be around something or someone they can't have. Whether it's because I know it's not good, or she is with someone, or she don't want to be with me. <br>  It's just causing pointless emotions.|`|HMFyObHDaa	Trust me on this one, he's just embarrassed to talk to you, and doesn't know what to say. if you want to still hang out and stuff as friends there's no harm in that, and I'm sure he would like it, and who knows, you might start to like him back. This is probably just temporary and it will clear up after a few days of being forced next to him in class. Things should work out, I'm sure he still likes you, so he definitely wont deny a friendship if that's what you want of him.|`|Bwvb45BQaa	You pissed him off.<br>  "i hope you are not expecting more out of this than i am willing to give, you are such a nice guy but i dont see you as more than just a friend"|`|411a10352c444c2e97f87fafe76ed068aa	You were both reading the same book.

So now he may feel awkward that he let you know all that stuff. <br>  <br>  Sometimes if guys wanna be more than friends, they really cannot settle for less.|`|Jdiu48aiaa	because dummy he just wanted sex from you. he probably thought you were insecure and were easy. get over it and go on with you life.|`|cK0pDOnuaa	guys r just weird sometimes. forget about him for a while and act like u dont really care sense hes being so weird and kinda rude 2 u. and then talk 2 him later and c wat happens|`|mBMX7apyaa	what grade are you in?im guessing your a freshman <br>  <br>  umm well guys usually dont talk to girls after they get rejected... so you did it to yourself|`|w13CQjBfaa	he likes you<br>  if you don't like him, ignore him.|`|ccSepzgcaa	He probably feels embarrassed that his feelings weren't reciprocated, but you did what you had to do by being honest with him. He wanted more than friendship and feels like he was "shot down" so his reaction is normal too. <br>  <br>  He may have said he was cool with being friends, but when he had time to think about what just happened, he wasn't happy with it. I'm sure he's partially mad at himself as well as disappointed that you don't like him back. <br>  <br>  You may still be able to be friends when he has had some time and maybe a girlfriend or two under his belt before he can be friends with you again. Your only other option was to ignore him or be his girlfriend and considering you weren't interested, you were straight up and honest with him and very respectable by being that way.|`|O6Xbzx9Yaa	he was trying to get some!|`|IBJYA52Uaa	he's a player, honey. you need to see right through that.
bQisGgSsaa	Tell him what you want to do.|`|BjQcwGSLaa	You are just his girlfriend, so it is only natural that his family comes first.

If it does, then that would be the perfect time to talk to him about how it makes you feel. And if it doesn't affect him, then you may want to think of your happiness first and dump him.|`|QczEdd5qaa	let it out easy....<br>  <br>  or continue dealing with his BS|`|exDAHnYsaa	maybe you need a few days without him|`|aBL04eRbaa	If you can't stop him from doing soooo many family things, <br>  help out and put your self to be apart of the family to. <br>  Also maybe if one day your family needs a little help with some thing, <br>  Ask him to help out and see if he jumps to help just the way he does with his family.<br>  It's good he has good family morals, and he helpful, <br>  just see if he is as helpful with your family as he is with his,<br>  it's not expected that he will be, <br>  because every one always puts their family first, <br>  but see if he atleast makes an effort.<br>  And remember to include your self!|`|lObEjUh1aa	well it sounds like you're placing the relationship in a higher priority status than he is.  i know this isn't the news you wanted to hear, but you can't rearrange someone else's priorities for them.  all you can do is try to find someone with priorities similar to your own.  one thing to bear in mind is that most women will place relationships much higher on their priority list than most men, so it will be very hard to find a man who places relationships as the number one priority in his life.<br>  <br>  if you decide to look for a man whose priorities align more closely with your own, then i wish you the best of luck.<br>  <br>  if you decide to make the best of things with your current boyfriend, then respect his priorities and try to build other things (hobbies, friendships, sports, etc.) into your own life so you have more things to do when he is busy.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps; good luck!|`|0be940862a3c253f0432eb848850e14aaa	How dare he put his family before you! Shame on him! I don't know what "things" you mean but if they include school and having a life, then it sounds like he has his head on straight. It sounds like the two of you have different ideas of what the nature of your relationship is, and if you cannot talk about it, then you don't have much of a relationship at all. Just a thought.|`|GCAoz9VGaa	Well it is his FAMILY. <br>  They're important too.<br>  But if you feel he's completely neglecting you then force him to talk about it.|`|83y9Vu5oaa	well family comes first in most ppls lives. if he doesn't want 2 talk bout it there may b more going on then u know. give it some time. if it doesn't change, take a break.|`|ndsFDeIAaa	Spend more time with your friends get out more .|`|A6ltfbkOaa	try to get him to go on a date if he wont then maybe a break is in need|`|Bnq0B8SKaa	do you really think it's unfair for him to prioritize his family? Do you have other things in your life that are more important than him? I think you need to be very clear with yourself first of all about what your expectations of him are and ask yourself if that is really reasonable. Once you have done that, explain to him what you want and why, and listen to what his expectations are for your relationship. If you have very different ideas of what dating means, then maybe it's time for you to look for someone else, or reconsider your expectations.|`|aXM09Gzuaa	The last thing a guy wants is a clingy girlfriend.<br>  If you want to keep your relationship going good, do NOT constantly text/call him or facebook him or whatever you kids do. Some guys don't like to talk about their relationships; they like to live life, not talk about it. Don't be alarmed if your boyfriend doesn't want to open up about his current situation.<br>  Since he sounds like he's really busy, set up a time once a week for just you two. Or maybe every other week if you don't have time. Find a favorite T.V. show and watch it together every week. Or plan an actual place to go or a movie to see. Sometimes it gets boring just "hanging out" every time you see each other.<br>  If all else fails, tempt him to be with you by do him little "favors". Aka, hook up with him more often. No guy can say no to that.|`|62h3XFzpaa	You have a right to feel whatever you feel. It's what you do about that feeling that counts. However, if you continue to confront him with a choice between you and his family or other things which interest him...he will rid himself of the nagging you. Try to keep that feeling of being "second in line" to yourself and concentrate on making the times it's you in front, happy and fun. Why make yourself miserable dwelling on the negatives? If you feel you need some time apart, fine. But be nice about it. Remember that even in the most promising relationships, there must be separate and individual time...or the "always together staleness" sets in. You may discover the more space you give him the more he'll want you with him.|`|mOKNqh0daa	I think family should always come first. Being family oriented is a good quality in a guy in my opinion, however if you are really feeling neglected I would tell him, and if it doesn't change, move on, simple. If he finds he wants to make you a priority in his life, you will get back together and it will work out. Just don't be in a relationship that doesn't make you happy.|`|lBIewFwkaa	Well, family things shouldn't upset you, it just shows that he cares about his family.  As for the other stuff, try talking to him about doing some of the things he loves together, and if he doesn't like that, then perhaps you need to find out if he is really serious about you.|`|J78qs4G4aa	You should try every way to talk to him about it because if he really cares for you then he will listen to what you have to say.

That's a very admirable quality..<br>  <br>  But the fact that he's getting mad well that's dumb.<br>  Just talk to him!! Tell him how unhappy it's making you. Don't break up, that's too drastic.|`|OnKXBIHLaa	I don't want to sound rude or anything, but to many people, family does come first. <br>  As for 'things' I don't know what you're talking about so I can't help you there I'm sorry.<br>  But don't bother him too much about it or you might come off as whiny.|`|0cw1YxQCaa	you should stop hounding him all the time.

Just ask her.  If you are trying to be "cool" or something so that she will continue to talk to you, than I would say it's not even worth continuing.  But, like I said, just ask her.  How could she possibly be offended?  And if she is, its ok, just say "sorry, I did not mean to offend you, I just thought it would be nice for us to see what one another looked like".  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|mnn93iQtaa	like we have been talking for a while and i think we would be good together n do you mind sending me a couple of pics to see what you look like. or something close to that but that makes it sound like you only like a girl for her looks make it sound like you really want pics or just come right out and ask her for pics.|`|MbFE9kdTaa	Well send some pictures of yourself to her, and then ask if she has some to send back.

Tell her that you think of her often and would love to put a face to the conversation. Tell her that she seems so wonderful and interesting and you would just love to see what she looks like. Just be polite and she shouldn't have a problem with it. If she is apprehensive she may be hiding something. If you all have talked as much as you say...then she should be perfectly fine with it.

029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Alex, congrats! You handled this beautifully. If she put her head on your shoulder, she likes you. She would've totally moved away if you went to put your arm around her and she only saw you as a friend. Hell, she wouldn't even go to a movie with just you if she wasn't at least a little bit interested! She's not gonna make references to your date but you can bet she told her best friends about it. Your next move? Wait til a little later in the week, then ask what she's doing this weekend. Maybe invite her to a party you know of, or see if she wants to do dinner/bowling or some other fun combo. If she says no, it's okay. She might be a little overwhelmed and maybe needs more time to get used to the idea. In that case just tell her, "Well I like you a lot, and I'll be here when you decide you're ready."|`|BCD8FaxPaa	I would recommend asking her out on another date, but this time go somewhere more social, like a cafe or get some lunch together. Talk to her, she's a girl not some scary monster :o) Good luck dude.|`|82b9e4215671dcd9c72b4acb956563d2aa	She likes you!! she put her head on your shoulder, if she didn't like you she would of looked at you weird and pushed you away.  she's acting normal, she isn't avoiding you, isn't giving you weird looks or anything.  She prolly doesn't want to make a big deal out of it cause she doesn't know how you feel.  Try calling her or going up to her to ask her if she had fun.  Then ask her out again!! good luck.|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	Don't rush things, play it cool.  You said she made no mention of the movies, but did you say anything about it.  Did you tell how much fun you had, how you enjoyed her company, how you would like to take her out again?  I think that she would have not even gone to the movies with you if she was not interested.  Play it cool and take your time.|`|33387f0312b6f8eacc02d0ce050b7096aa	It`s because it was SCHOOL. She does like you, if she didn't like you she wouldn't have gone out with you.|`|CpLLA6Niaa	Give her a call and say how you had a good time on your last date, and ask her out on another one.  Maybe she is just nervous about how to act since your relationship has progressed into dating, and that's why she acted the way she did.  Just continue to let her know you like her and want to continue to see her, but don't get psycho about it...that will definitely scare her away!  Call her maybe tomorrow night to see if she wants to go out again this weekend.  If she turns you down, just take it like a man, and move on.  Good luck!|`|XOSc4cq3aa	Don't read so much into it. She seems like she had a nice time. The only thing you can do is ask her out again, and see where it go's from there. You'll know how much she likes you next time. Good Luck!|`|yA7s9QYIaa	tomorrow go up to her casually and say 'hey, how are you??"and put your arm around her. If she pulls away or looks at you funy, then she doesnt like you.

K3jcdkveaa	awh, that's a sin! i don't have my father either, haven't seen him for three years. i know how you feel.<br>  <br>  but i'm assuming you've tired everything you can to get him to talk to you, i'm not sure anything will work. maybe you should try to get him on some anti-depressants, and just go to see him a lot. so he'll know how much you care even though things are hard. just talk to him about your feelings, tell him that it's really hurting you that he wont talk, and you don't want to go through life without him.you wish things were the same, just keep reminding him. and tell him it would mean the world to you. and i know you've already tried, but tell him it wasn't his fault, and he needs to let go. but if that doesn't work. maybe not talking about it would be better.|`|AA11686091	You do a little research first.....Steven Curtis Chapmans' son ran over his 5 year old daughter last year.  .....  His son had to deal with the same thing as your father.  People did an article about him and there were a number of tv programs that also talked about the recovery....The Chapman family all got tattoos in memory of Maria.    Then find something you can do together to help him move on like a tattoo or building a park she would have liked or do something for a girl the same age in honor of your sister.  That may help both of you with the healing process.  I pray that helps you both.|`|a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	Awww :[  That's so sad.  I'm sure you've tried a lot of things if it's been seven years.  But maybe try to get him involved in things he used to enjoy with the family-- like a board game or watching sports, whatever will get him distracted from the sorrowful event in the past.  I'm so sorry-- hope your father will be able to recover from that depressing past soon.  <3|`|SrRsoLfmaa	Oh My God. I am so so so sorry!!<br>  <br>  This must be really hard, He wont be able to just get over it. No matter how long ago it was.<br>  <br>   Try To help him. You just need to love him.

That's alot to deal with sweetie. There is so much I could say here, but the bottom line and the simple answer to your question is there isnt really much you can do. Your father has to decide that he is gonna come back to life and deal with his own issues. You have to understand that he accidentally took the life that he helped create. Thats hard. No amount of jail time can punish him the way he's punishing himself. Love him. Pray for him. Dont lose yourself in it. Find your own way to deal her passing and his hand in it. Fight to keep your joy in place and do the best you can to love him through his hard time.|`|AA11279082	Intense, INTENSE, professional therapy for you both!  I cannot possibly let you know the depth of my sorrow for what happened to you and your father.  But can either of you be satisfied with a life of depression, remorse, and self-loathing??  Please, please find a psychologist who can help you back into the land of the living!  If your sister could speak for you, you KNOW that she would want you to find the strength to be happy again!!  Take the love that you will always have for her, and channel it into areas of your life that you know would make her proud!  Perhaps there's an advocacy group that you both could join to share with others what happened...and to hopefully one day tell everyone how you finally were able to benefit from a very real and horrible incident!  I wish I could take it all away from you both!  In the absence of that, my broken heart prays for all the good that the rest of your lives can offer you!|`|bmhT1IrTaa	confront him, tell him how you feel. try planning a trip. do something new. do anything to get him mind off of the subject, its gunna be hard but try your hardest and dont give up on him. obviously family is really important.  tell him that you and your sister love him very much. talk to the school counselor, a therapist, physiologist, anything that you think might help. talking it out is the best way. get all the emotions out on the table. thats how me and my abusive father got through out problems  <br>  <br>  im really sorry for what happened and i hope that things get better between you two.|`|l1YYtAPjaa	maybe you should comfort him and say it's okay. people do mistakes everyday in their lives. even though your sister is gone she is definitely in a much better place. and i believe evrything happens for a reason! he should come to his senses that you are his daughter too and you are as well affected by the incident so he should try to make you happy... love you for who and what you are!!!<br>  it's sad to see someone misrable.. he should takes it easy on himself!<br>  it's not like he did it on purpose.|`|JnosRXlGaa	so sorry to hear that but honestly theres not much you can do but try to be there for him. if hes going thru court for this...sorry to say but he might be hit...accident or not...my father in law was in an accident and was charged with involentary vehicular homicide because a baby and its mother was killed and did 15 years in prison for it. dont mean to drag down your day but my only suggestion would to just be there for him as much as possible|`|AXOOuK5yaa	That's something no psychologist or a doctor could cure.  The only thing I could suggest to you is that you try taking him to a church.  Let him know that he is forgiven by the Lord... Of course he isn't going to want to go because he probably hates God right now too. But that's the only suggestion I have for you.|`|V9qmbFQOaa	Your father needs help. Have you tried counselling where you go along together? Perhaps you could take him away for a break together.<br>  Let him know how you feel. If you can't talk to him write it all in a letter and let him know how much you love and need him.<br>  Do you have a mother? If so how is she coping with all this?|`|GXMTwCLTaa	okay, first i would like to say I'm very sorry when i hear this, people like me that don't even know you care for you so don't give up. I'm not exactly sure, for something like this i say, see a real specialist, if you are in school, a school psychiatrist..|`|gOwakeM1aa	Tell him you love him. Only God can take away our problems. He knows everything about us. He wants us to come to Him with all our pains and questions of life. He says in Matt11:28, " Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.|`|UMa3jvRHaa	aw  im sorry =(<br>  <br>  but seriously the best thing you could probally do is talk to him about it. no matter how much it hurts it's just better to get it all out in the open, and maybe it will open his eyes up to stuff. <br>  <br>  hope it helps good luck =)|`|AA11785910	Oh My gosh! Im so sorry. If you dont want to confront him, write hima huge letter on how you feel, and to get over what happened seven  years ago. Cause u cant rewind life and try things differently than the last. Tell him what u feel without a dad.|`|j41BEfMAaa	If ur dad did do that, he might be regreting it and is not really depressed.  Tell him you love him and that your sister does too.  That she is up there watching you all and that she forgave him for that.|`|lmKwo7Kjaa	Try to get his mind of of it, tell him to focus on raising you rather then morning her death. lost of family is diffucult but morning over them is just a self destructive mood.|`|988AQEOVaa	well im sorry about that.<br>  maybe you should tell your dad if he believes he didnt do it, then you will and probably every one else should.<br>  otherwise, cant help you out on that one.....|`|CkSEpHhzaa	aw poor guy, and you. take him to therapy or something; sitting around wont helpp|`|RKWgapOhaa	awwww man that really sux...im so srry|`|d8RPeFtZaa	I'm glad you have lots of answers to choose from.  I am going to give you mine, which comes from a somewhat similar personal experience of an equally serious nature.  It sounds like your dad is stuck at the beginning of the grieving process -- dealing internally with overwhelming feelings of shame, remorse, self-criticism, and self-hatred over what he has done -- all the while perhaps still in denial publicly.  In order for him to get over this, he has to admit and accept his part in the tragedy, and then complete the grieving process.  All YOU can do is let your dad know you accept and love him for who he is -- who we all are, really -- a fallible human being with both successes and mistakes in life on our record.  Remind him that who he is IS NOT what he has done.  Remind him that judging and persecuting himself will not change the past.  Finally, remind him that by not accepting the facts and forgiving himself, he is continuing to cause more damage to the family and to himself, something his sister would have never wanted.|`|klOCSOKHaa	It's up to your father to come out of his depression. But you can help him out. Take him aside and talk to him. Tell him how you feel and that you miss him. Even if he doesn't reply, he needs to hear what you have to say. He'll come around.|`|1XPugrcuaa	talk to him and tell him its not his fault... to let go (even if it IS his fault) say u still have me, your son. and im here for you... i just need you to be here for me.... so quit moping dad and live the good numbered days you have left ahead of you,...And please try to live them with us....love ya!!<br>  <br>  <br>  haha that was good huh? all from the heart... my mom went insane ..but even my words cant bring her back... so i feel your pain.|`|GaBzFHxTaa	If you want to make him feel better you could tell him you don't accuse him for your sisters death. (Sorry to hear that by the way.) It will make him feel better I hope. Good luck bud.|`|AA10415431	Go to    www.advancedthetapractioner.com  I suggest working on yourself  first to heal your emotions, beliefs etc... Through this work perhaps your father will be ready for help after he sees you healing.....|`|AA10057370	Talk to some bible believing ministers about counseling|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	You call for help a minister, priest, or even  social services, this is way over your head.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	I am so sorry that this has happened to your family and for the loss of your sister.<br>  <br>  Seven years is a long time.  Your father doesn't seem to be able to come to terms that it was an accident and that he has another child, you, who needs him as well.  It is obvious that he is overwhelmed with guilt and loss - just as I would guess you are overwhelmed with the loss of your sister and your father.<br>  <br>  Has your father received medical attention for this?  Is there anyone that can help to get him to a psychiatrist?<br>  <br>  I think what others have said about trying to talk to him is a good idea.<br>  <br>  The very best advice I can offer and stand with you in is that you would pray to God to lift this from your father.  That God would help him to open up and release the sorrow and guilt of this to Jesus and that he would come back and be a father to you.  It is never to late to ask.  You may have already done this, you didn't say, but don't give up.  Get people to stand in agreement with you in this.<br>  <br>  I will pray for you and for your father.|`|zlsEYZBKaa	You have to try to get him some help for him, he could have Post Traumatic stress disorder.|`|EZyHOht7aa	Time will heal your wounds, young one. You must learn to soar like the eagle.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Aww...I'm sorry for your loss. I don't think you will ever be able to get your Dad back the way he was. He needs some serious counseling to get over his depression.
3iNobwVraa	Self love, baby.  Love thyself, or stop showering alone.<br>  <br>  Keep an eye on the water heater though, cold water would be pretty awful at an inopprtune moment, lol.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Go for it - invite your spouse in the shower and have some real fun.|`|wJRHTS7Maa	nope just u|`|IKXZZDH9aa	My wife was pissed when she came home one day and I had changed the shower head wand to a fixed shower head....seems as though there's a point to being able to move it around...weird.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	That's why I sometimes take showers with my hubby!|`|fRIEHBJOaa	umm..just you buddy.|`|67zBvnNjaa	WTF.. lol|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Girl, I know what you mean. I am the other woman in my situation and the man I'm involved with a got no on the shower head. It I tilt it a certain way and that stream of water hits what its suppose to hit. Child, I may let that woman have her husband back. <br>  <br>  Ain't it good to be alive!|`|uuMCGT9taa	well i usually shower with my bf and we end up messing around and doing it <br>  <br>  but if im alone and i get a little horny i use my shower head to get there.|`|lckgvz2laa	A lady never reveals her secrets.|`|2keIEMFUaa	No! But whatever turns you on go for it I guess...|`|VqilAWDGaa	it hasn't happened to me yet.|`|jBigEy0Caa	No my shower does not do that to me.  Maybe I should try staying in there longer and see what it does for me?|`|ivsYJPx3aa	thats why you need an oil man ....drill Baby drill!! Time for the stocks to rise!!   lol...lol...lol...
m2bSgeRWaa	i talk to my friends everyday in school. i text them everyday after school and on the weekends (unless im really busy)!|`|6yt7mDcIaa	A close friendship won't happen overnight, even if two people click. The fact that you are open to friendship and want to be a good friend is a great start.<br>  Be patient, it takes time to get a good network of friends especially if you are starting from scratch. Trust others, Take interest in others, Confide in others and you will find that friendship blossoms naturally!<br>  <br>  Talk when you have something genuinely interesting to say! You can sustain friendships even if you only get to speak once a year. If you are trying to make friends don't bombard them with messages they might find it strange, but the odd message is nice and let's them know you are thinking of them and value them.
5QFuenebaa	I personally think verbal abuse is worse because physical wounds can heal, but a constant barrage of negativity can wear down a person's psyche for a lifetime.|`|6NyBAJRgaa	yes. if you torment someone long enough. they might start to believe what you say. which could cause them to go insane, Suicide, bring a gun to school, any numbeer of things. Physical heals waaaay easier than mental.|`|7LRPvZkhaa	yes if its a constant thing on the same person
5QFuenebaa	I didn't see your original question, so I'll answer generally...<br>  <br>  If you're an adult (18 in the US) and and another person hits you, you could call the police and file assault charges.
bO2rzfISaa	You start when he's one year old and you raise him not to be arrogant. In other words, it's not possible. You shouldn't have married an arrogant man.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Sweetie, this is an oxymoron.  Humble pleasant is the polar opposite of his career.  He most likely is very good at what he does and his personality suits his career choice.  It is you that has made the mistake, you will need to learn to accept what you married or file for divorce.  Good luck.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You won't be able to change humility.  What you saw before marriage is what you get.  Unless being unemployed humbles him (however slightly) he will remain the same throughout his life.  The behavior is socialized throughout a lifetime and being a lawyer he most likely thinks even more of himself than you, I or anybody else who hasn't passed the bar exam.  Good luck...it will sap the life right out of you over time.|`|wzqahEqiaa	You cannot make someone be humble.  Some people are givers and other personalities are receivers.  Try doing some volunteer work and get your mind off the economy.  Helping others together could be a great bonding experience and strengthen your marriage.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn about humility try watching the TV series Super Saints on EWTN.  I put a link below to one of my favorite videos about Mother Theresa of Calcutta.  Good Luck!|`|AA11348136	Unfortunately, you cannot change him at all. It is up to him if he wants to change and even if he does change for himself, it will not happen overnight. Tell him how you feel and see what happens, if nothing, you need to get a divorce if you can't live with it.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	When he ends up homeless he will be humble.|`|zMg4hQwDaa	Why did you marry him if he needs to change. I am sure that there are things about you that upset him but he does not try to change you. <br>  Men marry women  hoping they don't change, women marry men to change them that = divorce. <br>  Buy him a book called how to win friends and influence People it might help but only if he wants to change, you can't force it on him.|`|ppF6oSCQaa	These things you describe are a part of his character, which can not really be changed.  Either a person is humble, polite and respectful or they're not.  You can bring these negative things up to him and he may in fact try to be more pleasant, but chances are, his true nature will come out.|`|O3CPESX1aa	You can change anything about any one but your self. The day will come when his pride will have to go. Someone with a power greater then you will do this for him.<br>  The old saying pride goes before the great  fall. Is very true. I have seen this happen many times. Not pretty to see either.|`|Fsbg8hbwaa	you can't. you example how to act, but you can't change someone that doesn't think anything is wrong with who they are, which he obviously doesn't.  you love him for who he is, it's who you married, good reason to really know someone before you make such a big commitment|`|8ad580cd99c0cf921506c236e4e80b8faa	He has to find his mistakes and rectify: when somebody spells it will lead to many complications: be calm: wait : time will give good solution:|`|wmOgseCgaa	You can't make someone be who their not. He has to see his own faults and change on his own.|`|41skve2Yaa	Sleep with someone close to him.
66dAMlktaa	different people have different upbringings and the teachings that they're taught with would eventually impact their actions as they grow...|`|mefxIQP9aa	It's most likely due to the way they're brought up.<br>  <br>  Japanese people are freaky.|`|FzFSzilmaa	because the people of asian descent have different upbringings...<br>  <br>  just like european...<br>  <br>  and some people only speak from personal experience, without knowing anything about the cultures involved...<br>  <br>  don't believe all you read on here...|`|eVsbtvi9aa	No, it all depends on the person.....race and ethnicity has nothing to do with it! one person may love sex while another dislikes sex.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	it's because of their culture, up bringing and religion.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	They have a different "slant" on it.|`|LNeSlzCCaa	just because they are asian doesn't make them all the same....Asian cultures are very diverse and different...or example girls from New York view se differently than girls from say Texas--but both groups are Americans....Anyhow--don't believe everything guys says most exaggerate to make themselves feel better...|`|xzSVZCIbaa	WTF?  I'm of Chinese decent and I LOVE sex, and believe me, I'm not hesitant in the least.  It just has to be with someone I love (or at least know really well and think is hot as hell). Most of my friends are exactly the same way.  We're all human.|`|8ioVO1YUaa	it's not an asian thing, its a women/human thing<br>  i'm sure there are a lot of white/black/whatever women that are prudes in bed and there are a lot of them that are crazy little bunnies|`|acf19784c47b1f7b60623f6016329936aa	They are not sex crazy but infact its actually the asian girls philosify to please the man and not themselves.....kinda behind in the times isnt<br>  china shares a completley different culture to the rest of asia|`|2HN1oivUaa	honestly, i don't care.<br>  what do u care huh?.........no offense though
1nvXBZ5Raa	Your man given you a piece of jewelery,a valuable one.So it will be a good idea if you will also give him a valuable piece of jewelry which he can always use.A watch is a great option. It is a wonderful way to show him how much you value him in your life.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	anything you want.|`|749a8ffbe06fcf93a2aea5684093a78daa	It depends on what the occasion was when he gave it to you...was it just because? Or was it a birthday? Anniversary?<br>  If it was an anniversary, just stick to whatever you originally got him<br>  My boyfriend of 4 years got me a promise ring on my 19th birthday two years ago. It was a complete surprise. I didn't expect it, but I didn't feel compelled or obligated to give him anything in return.<br>  <br>  I did however end up getting him a promise ring a year later for his birthday. It was just a plain silver band and it had our names and the date we started dating engraved on the inside. He loves it and will not take it off.
AA11967247	you bet.<br>  <br>  you may as well give her your home address. she will get it anyway through all the upcoming court docs.<br>  and it could save you some embarrassment.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	She can have you served anywhere they can catch you.|`|rx20pKgOaa	The "Ayes" have it, which means, yes, she can have you served where ever the server can find you.

QlXhPFSwaa	i guess it is up to you. i always plan to tell my future kids(if ever) that whatever they do, just make sure that they will take responsibility for it. if you think you can handle your mother's fury(i personally can't) after you come home from your escapade then go! i am telling you that when i was your age, i always follow my parents. AND I REGRET IT. coz they always say no if my friends ask me to go somewhere. to the point that my friends dont ask me anymore and i got used to being home being miserable... mostly i regret that im too coward to do what i wanna do. just something for you to think about.<br>  <br>  okay.. what i dont understand is why  you are looking up laws like it is a big deal? you are NOT running away. it is only for 2 nights. you are not using your parent's car. you told your mom about it she said no but u made up your mind to go. best you can do is write a letter addressed to your mom. put it in the kitchen table or anywhere she can read. make a copy for yourself so if ever your mom calls the cop on you again... at least u have the proof that your mom knows where you are and proof that your not running away but just wanna have fun. case closed. your law search sounds fishy to me. are you going with a much older BF on your escapade? if ever you will not be in trouble. He is.|`|ZP0Ez7RWaa	based on the way you speak you're no where near being an adult. Maybe you're parents really are controlling but you sound like you'd crash and burn if they weren't|`|03cd64db97799ad453f75f436a0f4b73aa	she will call the cops on you. you will be concidered a runaway and be found and brought back by the police. you are still a minor.. here legally we can move out at 16 but we have no rights as an adult because we are just 16. same with you. you are just.. 17.. oh and a half.. i would just let it go.. if you have a problem move out. but as long as your under your parents roof you go by their rules.. i figured that out when i was 10. at your old age of 17 1/2 you should have figured it out too|`|KjF0p72naa	...you just used "1/2" with your age. THAT shows me you arent even close to being an adult. 18 to buy ciggs (dont smoke) and vote-almost there you 17 and 1/2 year old you! hahaha|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	first off you are not a 17 1/2 year old young adult.  you are a 17 1/2 year old child.<br>  <br>  if you decide to go against your parents rules and up and go anyway, they may not allow you back in the house or they may go to the police and declare you a run away and have the people you are with arrested for harboring a run away.   <br>  <br>  by the way, even when you are 18 and still living in your parents home, you still have to mind the rules or pay the consequences!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dL6BcJQxaa	I think its easier to talk to strangers about certain things they will hear u out & not judge u upon the situation & what u want to do. Besides it helps how to figure out the problem|`|1otrcKRpaa	It depends realy if it is concerning a boy then go to a friend if it is to do with your education then a teacher you trust and almost any thing elce your mum and or dad. But some times telling people you don't know is a good thing too babes hope you work out what ever it is|`|YWaUaPaSaa	For me it's alot easier talking to someone I don't know. But you do have to describe it for them to know the people involved.  It's also easier because when it's someone you don't know they can't be bias because they don't know the people. It sounds like you have a big problem. You can e mail me if you want.|`|SOOXMxx9aa	Be careful  about talking to someone you don't know especially when its personal. I opened up to a councilor and he turned out to be a complete wan*er. So I felt I couldnt talk to anyone about it.|`|N6frEVbiaa	sometimes its best to go to strangers because they dont know how youre talking about and can give you proper advice without being on someone's side but if its osmething personal go to a friend !
8JU1hxZ1aa	yeah you waited a bit too long, however leave it a day or two before trying again... maybe send a message instead?|`|CBa9G4j4aa	Yeah I think you waited a little too long but it will be okay. Call her again in a day and show you are interested. She probably thought you lost interest and now she's bummed out. But don't give up hope!|`|JV0i77uiaa	Give another try, yes a week is too long, you should call her at least two days after, but if you like her call her back and explain why you did not call before and go from ther but don't forget her.

CDMTteeYaa	Yeah. There are many of us who are facing the same situations or maybe worse situations than some of us. It's just that we people are selfish to think that we're the only ones who have the worst issues that we can't be blamed, which is wrong. When people have the same situation, it's way better to ask them for advices because they know where we're at, they've experienced it, right? And same as we listening to their problems also. Often when a guy and a girl are facing the same problems, struggling in the same situation, they end up being together; because they realize that only they are the ones who understand each others problems. That's kind of my view, i don't know. lol What about yours?|`|5q7unmZVaa	me and my good friend joe a while back realized with both felt the same way about the opposite sex in relationships. we both have been hurt a lot, and we both realized theres no point in getting feelings sturred up for someone or something, theres no point they always let you down in the end. i felt more comfortable around him and more open, it really made me think about myself.|`|LtP7oOtraa	yea, my best friend kim and i always end up going through the same things at the same time and we always know exactly how the other feels. and we don't judge the other person. it feels really good when i think no one understands and i talk to her. i don't know if it betters me as a person, but it gives me hope i guess you could say. that the world isn't lonely.|`|4g2EAbtMaa	Just from reading some of the Q/A on here leads me to realize I'm not the only man who's been hurt by a lying, cheating b*tch. So, yeah. I guess it helps to know I'm not alone.|`|3CBWubtAaa	i have this guy friend and girl friend and we're like a family<br>  we just get along so well, and we just let each other know about how we feel about people at our school and we all agree, but not for the sake of agreeing|`|JdtLTvRGaa	no those things have neva happened to me but think about it, there are 6 billion people in this world, surely one of them has to feel exactly the same as you.|`|It1AG94oaa	everyone in love feels the same feeling, its just expressed and translated in all our unique way|`|fQ0T2ZHfaa	Yeah I'm sure there are other serial killers out there.|`|Clas4cCpaa	YES! i had an experience when i fell in love with a guy, and i couldn't even begin to be able to describe in words how i felt. and a few of my friends hadn't fallen in love yet, so when I tried to talk to them about it they just didn't get it. Then I talked to another one of my friends who had, and it was so awesome because we COMPLETELY understood everything the other person was talking about! It's so exciting when originally you feel so stupid that you may be the only one in the world who feels a certain way, but you don't know how to put it into words, and then someone else is able to describe it exactly the way you feel it, and you realize you're not the only one! It's really comforting to hear someone else voice the thoughts that you can't seem to put into words.|`|hfyvLLNEaa	Yes, I have crossed someone with the same feelings as me. <br>  There are over 6 billion people in the world. Someone is bound to have the same feelings as you. (Not perfectly, obviously though)|`|ZGVZI3CBaa	It's a wonderful feeling to find somebody who sees the world through the same lens you do... You'll want to keep that person in your life forever. :)|`|8JAROOXBaa	yes. definetely. i think about that a lot. i think it's entirely possible|`|O6ldKDa4aa	Yes|`|ouG5RSVtaa	hmmm.... no,  not really sorry.       <br>  <br>  <br>  cya later|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Happened to me once, it was like talking to yourself. Pretty cool, you never get tired of talking to them. But I lost her, worst mistake of my life and now I don't know where she is :(|`|KasFZL7laa	yes i do but that's basically just because of questions people ask on here, lol.|`|iT0Z2icCaa	of course everybody goes through the love / hate phases sooner or later . and sure its great to share with someone who either or has or is going through the same problems as you at the time . however while at the time it feels great to talk to someone who understands its not good to dwell on the negative stuff too long , its best to move on with hope in your heart  a smile on your lips and pep in your step , and remember both men and women are like buses ..... if you miss one there will be another along shortly . ..... . and here is a little thought for you to dwell on , some yrs ago the seekers had a hit with a song  titled .... another you . some of the Lyric included the lines ..... their is always someone for each of us they say ile be your someone for ever and a day i could search the whole world over until my life is through but i know ile never find another you .        ifs a beautiful song with so much meaning . its so full of meaning and so true to life , so the moral of my advice is that no matter how beautiful or how ugly you are their is someone out their who will always love you . i hope my little contribution here cheers you up and makes you smile  .|`|8oX0wZAIaa	Yes! Well, pretty similar--we've had really unique past experiences. We were both working our butts off in school, same religion (Muslims), lived only one city away (all this time!) and had similar life "crises" and thoughts. It was pretty amazing. Even though I felt too immature for a relationship, I just couldn't pass the guy up. So we were friends for a year & then went out for a few months. Sadly, it ended because we were so stressed--and honestly, too similar....Now, I really miss him & want to tell him I still love him but I'm just too afraid of screwing everything up or changing my mind half way through the relationship and then hurting him. I will have to be more mature before I ever take anyone's heart (or give mine). Anyway, it helped me though; because when the going got tough, he always had the composure and focus that I only dream of. I get sooo stressed with life, but I somehow manage. I just wish I could balance everything like him. Granted, I do have some more responsibilities...family, household, school, friends, clubs etc.<br>  <br>  *sigh* sorry I just ranted...but in other words, there is probably someone out there like you!|`|7PqwM6QXaa	yes!<br>  a lot of days, me and my friends are always like ''i feel so lonely, everyone else is dating and im not'' and i say ''ah, me too!'', but like a month later, they'll get a bf lol, and im stuck, all alone =/|`|AOkucu5haa	The world's population's roughly 6,706,993,152; I think it's safe to say there's at least one person who feels they way you do.
dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Since you didn't file, there is no way for the government to compare submissions.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could file your tax return. Or place a call to IRS to find out how this happens.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	You were only married (in the same house) for four months of the year, you did not file your own taxes like most people do, you did not see the check to know if it came with both of your names on it.....call the IRS and ask them your question|`|W4XuUr72aa	He probably left with the paperwork and forged your signature.  <br>  It's easy to get your spouse's social!<br>  I don't see how he could even be eligible for a stimulus check of any size without a family!|`|2keIEMFUaa	So then you need to ask him how he filed and he did file married joint then he owes you $600 and let him know that your going to report him if he doesn't give you your money due you.|`|lckgvz2laa	Call the IRS..

mFbPOUWyaa	I have felt like that before!  Especially in Jr. High!  <br>  <br>  Your only in 8th grade, don't let silly little things like this bother you hun! Don't let her get you down.  If she is saying these things about you odds are she has some reason to be jealous of you!  Just brush it off & stay positive!  <br>  <br>  You need to surround yourself with friends that make you feel good... make you laugh all the time.  That way your thinking about other things then appearances!  And make sure your personality shines because if you ahve a good personality your friends will ALWAYS want to be around.  I'm sure your beautiful inside and out.  Don't let the rumors bother you!  Your WHOLE entire high school life rumors will come and go - and you'll find yourself spreading them.  As long as you know they aren't true, it shouldn't bother you.  Even if they are true no one knows that for a fact!  That is WHY they are rumors!<br>  <br>  Stay happy and try to laugh the rumors off. Remember that your the bigger person because you didn't start rumors about her.
3oyY72rVaa	i would totally go. just take them in May because, whats a team without a manager? ;)
0fcwsv7Vaa	Yes. Actually, i dont finish last. I just cant even qualify. <br>  <br>  RACING ANALOGY|`|t0K6Haoyaa	sometimes, but jocks aren't all that they are suped up to be. Just be yourself and all those awesome, beautiful, mean girls in school won't be so pretty anymore. You'll know why those girls didn't give you any chance. It's so that the nicest, and prettiest girl will be the lucky one to get you. Just be yourself. Jocks aren't everything. i'm not interested in them personally, but you don't want to be mr. goody goody. That's not sexy.|`|X5W3leICaa	yuuup|`|xkMadpW5aa	id rather a nice guy|`|9UNWtVW5aa	I think it's nice people in general.I'm a girl and i think in my case it's absolutely true.I could be wrong though.Sucks doesn't it?|`|nk3QCoPvaa	Nice guys always finish first. The jerks may win some of the short run battles, but in the long run, the nice guys end up on top. Every time.|`|O7xYvttsaa	thats only when we're young. the nice guys get real relationships and get married first, the a$sh0les just keep f*c<ing around.<br>  but yeah, cocky jocks are more fun to date.|`|FSK1v5neaa	yea or maybe the guy is just ugly.|`|JMiIjqyGaa	Yes.|`|CYeWFPcoaa	dude ive experienced this before and it's a strong yesss|`|X4i2jej5aa	I think the main reason is that nice guys are too shy to make their move, that's how they finish last, because they don't even try to be first. Cocky guys have more confidence and when they have an eye out for someone, they go up and ask them out right away, nice guys hesitate and cocky guys don't. For all the nice guys out there: HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF AND YOU'LL FINISH FIRST!!|`|BjyXKFpRaa	that might be true for some people but little do they know the cocky guys will make you eventually want a nice cause they don't want you,they will disrespect you,they will lie you and I can go on but the rest is easy to find out,so don't worry they will wish for u in the long run.|`|YVS53aksaa	yes it happens. because all the hot guys are concieded jerks (most of the time) because they learn that girls are attracted to them and they can get more. and not so good looking guys dont get alot of attention and appreciate a girls love alot more, and dont do stupid things and take chances.|`|26ubZfbFaa	it happens sometimes, but i personally prefer nice guys/ although i do seem to notice that nice guys normally go for mean girls. so i guess nice people tend to finish last unless they're lucky nice people.|`|0lK97zzVaa	maybe, but it pays off in the long run!|`|loWnyd0waa	well first the guy needs to get a nice gir(that is in his league, haha)l!! but if he is trying to do that and doesn't succeed than he is probably weird and/or annoying.|`|LtP7oOtraa	not always, the shallow girls that are gonna spend all of their money on plastic surgery won't go for the nice guys...but the girls WORTH having will definitely go for the nice guys, so from his point of view he'll finish first.|`|LPxKxA6Taa	girls start off with the bad boys etc. In the end the girls get more mature and go for the nice guys because girls then find out it doesnt matter about the looks but internally too.|`|PD91hIYWaa	sometimes, because nice guys often arent forceful enough to make their feelings known. but deep down every girl wants a good guy.|`|ptWHIVjZaa	No.  The nice guys just need to start asking out the nice girls.  Seriously, I'm not kidding.|`|vycAqfkiaa	For now it may be true. But once you get rich all the hot women will flock to you. See women like the guy on top...all the time.|`|XtWSiFPsaa	NO nice guys may finish last in highschool and stuff but in the long run girls want to end up with a nice guy so hang in there|`|pPS2UZ4Aaa	So true. All girls including myself LOVE jocks. Theyre so muscular and they feel so warm when they hold u..<br>  i try to go for the nice guys nowadays but theyre all so shy around the girls..=/|`|eO35QeTeaa	It true for both guys and girls.|`|cjcN6EKMaa	not in my world<br>  i love the nice guy?<br>  stay in there|`|n4tzvlAmaa	usually....|`|YQYZR7I0aa	i disagree<br>  <br>  there are ways to overturn the nice guy in to the perfect balance between being cocky and still caring for someone feelings<br>  <br>  there are tips to become the master man every girl wants and it took me 4 years to get me this stage where i am confident plus be a nice guy and still giving girl the attitude and still be caring.<br>  <br>  it is called the mastered balanced man<br>  <br>  i know how to overturn me. ask me and i will teach you guys.|`|yJKJBl9Maa	ya definatly|`|wuRTVS3aaa	I think you are missing it.<br>  I know many girls that go for the cocky guys first, but they don't always last.  <br>  There are many guys out there that are good guys that are getting the girls too.  I don't think all good guys are left in the dark.|`|O9yERnVGaa	i'm a nice guy and i never finish prematurely...wait what?|`|vrkbTq0Kaa	my ex was the " nice guy" and he did always finish last. well we met we fell in love and all as well for about 7 years, know hes the cocky guy! so yes usualy they do but when you find what your looking for remeber your the nice guy and stay that way!|`|qu8nHkhpaa	ok,<br>  if your a nice guy with a personality that pops <br>  then you chouldnt finish last but, most nice guys are very quiet and dont like to be in spotlight. <br>  <br>  but most nice guys dont ever get noticed so in a way they do finish last.|`|7N6F5zEbaa	That's just how life is. Once the girls mature and have enough of the 4 inch jocky guys, they come to the nice guys for some LONG loving. ;)|`|47WmUn7Uaa	I think if a girl really likes you it won't matter if you are a cocky jock or not.|`|JT10KvVTaa	I like the nice guys and there is some one out there for them all.|`|MkxYI1Msaa	Not really. I like guys who are respectful of me and my feelings. I'm not into the "cocky" jocks. Some of them are hot though....|`|knvaVvHVaa	Well I think it's the shallow girls that are going only for image and nothing else that go for the jocks..|`|zx8cVDqIaa	That relates to me|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	Not true, I hate cocky guys. Nice guys are awesome!|`|aXKM4aQMaa	sometimes|`|aEeCCHVlaa	The girls haven't really matured to the real world.  Depending what the "start" is would dictate if I would be last or not.  If breaking the law, getting involved with drugs/ alcohol, getting STD, I most certainly would want to be dead last in finishing.  I have seen many, many nice guys finish - maybe not first, but certainly not far behind.|`|Z8FShKTmaa	In high school they do. But in the long run, the nice guys will get the good girls and the jerks will die of aids.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Maybe in school when everyone is immature, but when girls are ready to settle down, they want the nice guys.
a9158ed922422742a841f62fbf1b64d6aa	This has happened to me before! I really liked the first guy I dated, and he was very sweet. We eventually ended it and decided to stay friends, but whenever he IMed me, I'd get a little more excited or feel a bit happier than if I were talking to other people.<br>  <br>  I also know a guy now who, 2 years ago, I would have never considered as a long-lasting relationship partner. Whenever he came online, I was so happy and always smiling. I really liked him when I was online, but when I met him for a movie, I felt like we were very close friends or even brother and sister. (Ew!)<br>  But now, after getting to know him better and after he matured a bit more, I found out that I did like him. It was just that something in us back then wasn't compatible enough, so I probably held back and my mind started thinking that he just wasn't right. Now we're boyfriend and girlfriend--and I definitely don't see him as anything close to a brother now!<br>  <br>  Okay, so after rambling on and on with my own personal story, I just wanted to say to you that I think you do like him, but you probably have something against him, even if it's really small. You may not know it, but your mind is trying to convince you that it isn't a perfect relationship. It won't be easy to get over him, but when you find another guy who you truly care for and who cares about you, you won't be thinking of this guy so much anymore. HOWEVER, I won't say that whenever I'm down or if something's not working, I don't think about the first guy--because I do! It's just that there's a difference between thinking about someone and wishing to be with them all over again. :)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps! Good luck, and if you feel like he's just a friend, don't try going out with him again because it'll feel really weird!|`|PPlagXIzaa	Yuor just probably nervous that he might say something online that he won't say in person. Or your around more people when you talk to him in person so you seem more friendly then online.<br>  <br>  Answer Mine Please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aid_f4Ta80N4y7WSf_qhBCDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309180045AATBFlC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|O6ldKDa4aa	maybe give your relationship another shot....|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	you still have some feelings for him, he was ur first after all
IExXmir1aa	Dude, she definitely like you. But, she is scared of rejection because she probably thinks that you think she is weird or that you don't like her. She only talked to you about school because she didn't want to make the conversations uncomfortable to you.|`|Q3WweuOCaa	Just ask her out for a danish or something. Everyone likes Danishs'....get it out of the way. If she says no, she does not like danish, ask her if shes wants to share a meatball. Good luck!|`|sCCjAKllaa	Yeah, you seem to be overanalyzing every little detail to the core, and that's enough to make any normal person miserable. She's just a regular girl.|`|4e0pOmt7aa	hey i am a girl in school and dude she likes you i like a guy and that is what i do go for her and be nice don't make perverted jokes or anything we don't like that.|`|0C8lOe6Faa	try talking to her about something else and do u even like her? become friends with her and then u will really know|`|PGCKZl1Laa	what do you mean "guys like me?" Being shy isn't easy you know it is hard on us girls. cause we don't know how to relate to you often loud and out there guys. You see we realize that you guys are very different species and thus are sometimes oblivious. Sorry, but then again that doesn't account for ALL men. just most. lol anyway I think she does like you she just doesn't know what to do about it. I think you should well, I would say talk but that might be kinda awkward, just start some conversations. try some subjects that are unrelated to school, like movies, food, etc. Try it. I think you should! be yourself that is really the basics. well Good Luck! and by the way, Of course she is just an ordinary human being. LOL|`|vJvwYDGTaa	Honestly you are probably over looking it. But the only way to find out if your not is by talking to her. If shes shy shes obviously not gonna make the first move, so thats where you come in. Just make casual talk wiht her, and be kinda flirty and see how she reacts.|`|gVah6Nj5aa	If you like this girl my advice would be to get to know her first...<br>  Invite her into your conversaions<br>  Trust me I know what you are going though im in highschool.<br>  <br>  When you get to know her ask her for her phone number...then ask her out.|`|Vr3PIQR1aa	She most likely wants to be your friend.<br>  She might be glaring because you're ignoring her.<br>  I don't know for sure, I'm not in your class.|`|rJsDu4qwaa	I am a girl and to me she doesn't seem to like you. She probably wants to be your friend, try talking to her|`|gcUBB0Gzaa	she does not like you.|`|wYcrYp7Daa	people arent books! dont read into anything and it will make life easier for you. damnit ur a silly foo|`|TVV6IBXLaa	WHOA....a GUY wrote this??<br>  <br>  Good job with the analyzing! I thought only us GIRLS did that. Good observations and sensitivity to her actions. <br>  <br>  hard to say....it's possible that she does or did like you but the glare could come from the fact that you "shrugged her off" when she tried to add to the conversation.  have you noticed the glaring started after that?|`|lOR7CH0waa	That's exactly what I do when I like a guy!!! Except, I try not to stare too much. :) I've actually glared at the guy I like, and it was because he asked another girl to 8th grade prom. ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! X( <br>  She might have heard rumors that you like another girl or something. That's the only reason I can think of when I glare at guys I like.<br>  She might also be shy because she just doesn't know what to say to a guy that she likes. That's exactly how I am, sadly.|`|78PJYsqUaa	ok sweet heart....first off.... us females are something u cant read... why? cause we can be up  and down at any given second.   so to make life easy wont you just ask her out or something. ask her how she feels. you will never know until u ask.|`|Ut5fUAhwaa	ask her. nobody but her knows. well...her and god:)|`|94IWoO6Eaa	yes she does like you! but dont be too stalkerish about it|`|JPt69qXBaa	idk im a lil confused though. she could just realy like you. and also sometimes chicks stare at guys just to see if they would notice them. trying to talk to her about non-school related issues is a good idea though that way u find out bout her and if shes into u or if shes just tryin to be ur friend. and im 1 of those shy chicks but im a rocker so if i hear anything bout rock-n-roll or hunting or other things like that i have to but in sometimes shy girls just want to but in to get some guy friends say hi out of the blue n see how she reacts ull know then.<br>  also what type of guy r u? that could have sumtin to do w/ it email me and answer my questions so i can give u better advice<br>  <br>  Hope i helped,<br>  drummer for lyfe<br>  <br>  <br>  krazzed_handsgd@yahoo.com
5TDCswaaaa	how often u see her has nothing to do with how strong ur relationship is. what matters is how serious u are about her.i mean, it IS hard when  u don't see her. but if ur willing do work for it, and u love her and are committed to her etc etc<br>  then its still strong.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Of course! Lots of long-term relationships work out where the couple only sees each other once a month or even less! If you love and trust each other unconditionally then it's fine. Make the most of the time you spend together.|`|1lHBktBdaa	Awwww same here hun. I only see my bf on the weekends cus we are both busy and we have trust so i know the relationship will work. We have been in this relationship for 3 months too. <br>  <br>  Dont worry as longs as u have trust and u keep talking and getting together, and doing fun stuff together, it will all work out just fine. Your relationship will definitely get stronger in time....its ok.<br>  <br>  Good luck to u both :)|`|JV0i77uiaa	As long as you see her in the weekend.  If you both of you are busy I don't see why your relationship why you would drift apart.  If you feel she is drifting away, ask her if she want you to see her more often.  Be aware that you both have priority and are busy she should understand that, so do you.  You both have to talk about this issue with her.  As long as you both talk and tex often it will be OK.|`|zAhwN8ueaa	me and my boyfriend had been dating for five months at the time and he had to go far away for baseball.<br>  hed go away almost every weekend, and he once went for a week and another time for two weeks.<br>  i cried alot, but it felt amazing when he came back.<br>  absense makes the heart fonder.<br>  what that means is its good to getaway cause it can make you stronger.<br>  me and my boyfriend have been dating for over 4 years now.<br>  good luck :)|`|wxz9mmMWaa	nope!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is a not so good relation...........she might be cheatin on u and u cud be clueless|`|Z8FShKTmaa	it depends. What does "see" mean? Do you talk to ger for a few minutes, or do you actually hang out? <br>  <br>  It's hard when you don't get to see your girlfriend all the time, but text her and talk to her on the phone a lot.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	It depends on the situation. Do you guys live close together or far apart? If you're close together you could try to meet up for a quick coffee of something. Seeing each other on weekends is good, but for some women they like a little bit more. <br>  <br>  You should talk to her about it, how she feels about only seeing you on weekends.<br>  <br>  If you live far apart then just make sure you talk on the phone a good amount.  You both have to be working on it to make sure it stays strong.|`|AKc8EaKTaa	me and my boyfriend of one year dont see eachother as often as we like either and i worrry that we will drift but in reality it only makes us miss eachother more and appreciate the once or twice a week we do get to be with eachother even more. both couples must put in the effort to see eachother and make the most of it. its not only the time spent together, but the quality of how the time is spent that makes or breaks the strength of a relationship. good luck!|`|e2f58b14df9f236c1bd340d61f7163d0aa	The way I see it, if you guys are actually busy during the week, seeing each other once a week is better than not seeing each other at all. If you guys talk often then I don't see a problem with that, but if you want to see her more, tell her that. There's nothing wrong with a little communication. It really does help.|`|9cPNA4nKaa	no, your in a terrible relationship and should leave, QUICKLY!|`|eevOrwypaa	Talk to your girlfriend about what your worried about and see what she says. My boyfriend of 15 months and I only really get to hang out on saturday, and we still have a very strong relationship. What helps us is that we talk on the phone everynight and drive eachother to school|`|cOBPCgtPaa	yes it can still be a strong relationship even if you dont see each other that ofter.<br>  both of you just need to be willing to be able to put the effort into the relationship<br>  <br>  <br>  someone help me please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlcbQZM1E.EReQMWqTE.CzDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309151051AA32TM3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|t0K6Haoyaa	yes that's fine. My fiance' and I do that all the time b/c he works away all week long and we can only hang out on every other weekend together... even though we live together, we never see eachother.

It'll work out!|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	as long as both of you are okay with this then you should be fine.  stay in touch during the week with phone calls, text, or e-mail and make sure that you trust each other.|`|Zgu62uoQaa	how old are you?  The reason I ask is that young people tend to be more impatient, so it might not work.  Older people tend to have busier lives more scheduling conflicts and more patience; so they can have a very strong relationship without seeing each other that often.  It will work if both of you keep open communication and make time for each other.<br>  <br>  For example, I'm in my 30s, have 2 kids, a full time job and very little time for dating.  My BF also has a busy schedule and when we started dating we saw each other about 2 times a month.  As we have grown closer we have both deliberately made time to see each other.|`|YVS53aksaa	if you really like her, make time to see her more and possibly move closer to her/with her after a long while. call her and send her letters, just to keep in touch.|`|XwyUATsKaa	Sounds like a great relationship!  May time for your life, and continue to make time for her.  You sound like a nice person.  <br>  <br>  Do something special next time you see her!|`|gT74D0Ggaa	Shore, its hard to have a stronge relationship when you're both bizzy! I can tell you are cause you don't even have time to look at your spell checker!|`|0lK97zzVaa	if you both really like eachother, then the relationship will stay strong. But its possible to drift apart!|`|vycAqfkiaa	You wont drift apart. It will make you stronger. You both have your own lives, and it's okay to miss each other sometimes. You don't want to get bored and tired of each other. If you guys feel really strongly and want to see each other everyday, then do whats best for your relationship. Only you guys know. I prefer to see my man only 1-3 times a week. If that. I like space.|`|5q7unmZVaa	buy her stuff take her out sometime. let her know she's the most beatiful girl you ever seen and rite her love notes.|`|dXXX7kL2aa	One of my friends, he lives in Boston, and his girlfriend is down in NYC.

But somehow they are one of the strongest couples I know.<br>  <br>  Make the most of face time (not movies...)<br>  <br>  Trust her.|`|mjy4oRvDaa	Only if you're getting laid.|`|3pWwclqpaa	if you love  eachother then youll be fine|`|KU0C99muaa	i see my boyfriend about once a week, sometimes it's a longer wait. but still, we have a strong relationship. we talk when we have time and we always call say goodnight to each other. make the most of the time you do spend with her!|`|D0E8oO0Naa	If on the once or twice a week youh<br>  guys spend ALOT of time with each<br>  other then maybe.<br>  <br>  Love has no distance.<br>  <br>  You can also communicate by<br>  internet, cell phone, or letters<br>  which will probably help your relationship :)|`|JT10KvVTaa	Well maybe the whole by and gf thing is not the best thing. But it is a good relationship as long as you guys make the most of the time you guys have together.|`|rg1OpthBaa	make time, in a way you are in a long distance relationship. and the only way it will work is if you two are committed to make it work. communication is key. good luck man!|`|BjyXKFpRaa	this will actually prove how strong is your love for each other.This a test that you and her must pass so good luck to the both of you.|`|qgbTosF1aa	yes it makes your love for each other stronger!!! and it makes you enjoy seeing each other! just think about it like this if you seen each other everyday you would be bored with each other and there would be no excitement.|`|hfyvLLNEaa	I suppose there is hope and it can be a strong relationship, but I believe from personal experience that these are the toughest relationships.|`|ZGVZI3CBaa	There's nothing terrible about that. My boyfriend and I only get to see each other on the weekends since he lives in a different town. However, our relationship is very strong, and we talk on the phone every day and keep each other updated on what's going on in our lives. I think that plenty of communication is enough to keep this sort of relationship strong and together. :)|`|k83XV7B6aa	If she's a naive girlfriend then not seeing her will only make her miss you even more (which is kinda good). If not then she's definitely cheating on you.|`|wI5bhnuBaa	It def still can be.  I have a good friend that has been going out with his girlfriend for 6 years now, and they only see eachother usually twice a month.  They do talk almost every night though.|`|lEBriVakaa	I think what matters is not the amount of time you spend together, but how you FEEL when you are together. <br>  <br>  You have obviously known each other for a long time, so now I think it's up to both of you to decided if this will be a solid relationship or if it will fade away. <br>  <br>  Think about how she makes you feel, and maybe talk to her about how she feels - would YOU like to see her more often???<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZUNmcAmmaa	Yess, it makes it even stronger. Trust me. Im in the same situation.|`|rwG67om9aa	absence makes the heart stonger and if you two love each other than everything will work out|`|1hVKeOEmaa	Possibly yes.A big mistake that many people make is that they constantly smother each other and that may not seem like a big deal to either of them but over time it gets boring and people lose interest.But if people are away from each other they miss each other and that makes just that much more pleasurable when they are with each other, creating a greater bond and understanding|`|FhGqjlfDaa	I'm in the same situation but worse. I don't get to see my boyfriend ever! We live in different cities, we've known each other since second grade, but we love each other soooo much!! So as long as you guys love each other, you can be sure that your relationship will last and be strong. :)|`|yv0N5w0baa	if your both like working ya thats an ok relation ship but if not well spend more time with her|`|O9yERnVGaa	what is a stronge?<br>  <br>  I think I read about those in Defense against the dark arts|`|n4tzvlAmaa	wow... im in the same boat as you buddy, ive known this girl for 2 years and we've been dating for 3-4 months... umm, its workin ok for me, as of now... so id say unless you have problems then it should be ok, it just depends on your two's bond you have|`|QdU4fNNIaa	call her alot while shes at home text with her ask wat she doin|`|ouG5RSVtaa	hey, you know what is better that worrying about relationship problems....eating some nice hot pizza. Just let all your problems go and enjoy the good things in your life.<br>  <br>  HAVE A NICE DAY EVERYONE....<br>  <br>  REMEMBER,   PIZZA IS YOUR FRIEND|`|0OyKadRyaa	From your spelling, it sounds like you're pretty young to have a girlfriend, even if all your friends are dating. I'd just stay good friends and hang out together, instead of worrying about the dating bit.|`|fP0uYtxMaa	It's not the quanity of time, but quality.  Make sure you do things she likes to do.  And be receptive to her willingness to do things you enjoy.  However, would you question a relationship that was strong?|`|zegsVEjUaa	Spending more time together will make your relationship stronger, but just because you can't spend much time together now does not mean you don't have a strong relationship.|`|3HYZMxRWaa	It will work, just talk or text as often as you can...without being clingy...and on weekends, make sure you DONT fight, and you have fun with eachother...make the time you do have worth it...
ac5cae42522c610efcafebeda6a6ba85aa	In all honesty, you should be speaking to a counselor at your school.  They can get you in touch with people who can help teens in your kind of situation.  Moving out just because of your mother's strict boyfriend rules, however, would not make any sense.  However, an emotionally abusive parent can really screw you up, and that's why I think it'd be best to speak to a counselor.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure she doesn't want you seeing a therapist because they cost money.  Your school should have someone you can see.|`|mFbPOUWyaa	Ok, I'm not going to say you don't have it bad but I will say people do have it worse when they're your age. <br>  <br>  So, you have an over protective mother, most people do.  She really does love you though.  She just shows it in an odd way.  I'm sure there are many reasons why she doesn't want you to leave home right now other than child support, she just isn't voicing it because she may not want to seem weak.  Just by reading this, I feel your mother needs you and that's why she is so overprotective.<br>  <br>  If your Father can't pay his rent, then how will he be able to support you?  That doesn't seem like a good option at all. As for your friends house, that would seem more stable then your fathers. You really need to think about if you can leave your Mom right now.  I have been in this situation when I was 15, and I wish that I would have just stayed with my Mother and SHOWED her how to be (she was on the "wrong" path in life).  But, I was only 15, and I couldn't help her.. the way she needed to be helped... And I think you can help your Mom!  Try building a relationship with her, a strong one this year... And when your 18, you can move out.  And talk to your Mother as little or as much as you want to then.  I think she needs you.<br>  <br>  If you need to talk about it further or ever need anyone to talk to, feel free to E-mail me.  I know how this feels honestly.  <br>  <br>  Just make sure you think it through...|`|1m4IJOTlaa	y did u let her find out? u should know her well enough... my parents would have done the same and i would expect them to.  the amount of **** i get up to without them knowing... imagine if i was allowed! id probably be on crack!!! lol<br>  <br>  take it easy... ul regret it if u move out... <br>  <br>  if ur dad cant pay the rent do u think that is stable???
iP7OHmOOaa	Just calmly explain to her that you don't agree with the attitude she's giving your boyfriend.  Make sure she understands that you want to be her friend still, but you feel like you're stuck in the middle and you enjoy her and your boyfriend|`|ttgyWGngaa	tell her you dont want to make a big deal out of this, but you need to talk to her.<br>  then tell her, nicely, that you've been noticing she's been being sort of rude to your boyfriend. tell her that you just want them both to get along and that you aren't favoring anybody.|`|XGHLrOklaa	First off we, strangers do not know you, your boyfriend or your Friend so why would you have to call them anything other than their real names? But whatever I think she has a crush on him that's all|`|l7g5JBEEaa	she sounds jealous tell her to grow up and get over it|`|g7aeECInaa	My friend is just like that.<br>  She protects herself and her feelings and so she tries to do the same for us. She probably treats him like **** because she knows something about him or thinks hes not good enough for you.<br>  Take her feelings into account. If shes a close friend she probably wants the best for you. Ask her why she doens't like him.<br>  as as in " Why dont you like bob?(lol)"<br>  not " stop being a *****"|`|iFJZ9fFVaa	Well, why doesn't she like him?<br>  Next time she rude tell her to stop being a bi*ch. Im serious, that's what you have to do i you don't want to talk to her. Imagine if you were being rude to 'Jill's' boyfriend and she called you a bi*ch, would you still make fun of him, or would you pretend like nothing happened?<br>  <br>  Boys can be smart too.|`|V9qmbFQOaa	She is totally jealous and insecure. She has no other friends obviously. If she was a real friend she'd allow you to make your own decisions  and mistakes.<br>  Tell her straight to but out or get out and be firm. Don't be blackmailed or bullied by her. <br>  Your boyfriend must really like you if he is still around after all her rotten behaviour.<br>  Drop her not him!|`|kRczQHw0aa	Just ask her to stop, but politely. Tell her you still want to be her friend though.
KOGxur8Vaa	Bleh, don't worry about it.. happens to all guys sometimes.<br>  <br>  In guys, testosterone is converted into estrogen (girlie hormone) while drinking. (that's why heavy beer drinkers grow fatty beer t1ts to some extent).. and why guys get a little gay-er when they're drunk.<br>  (no, that's not speculation people, it's medical fact.. get over it)<br>  <br>  Once you sober up, i.e. when you're on the comedown you'll probably find it a lot easier, so if you manage to stall for about an hour it could help, but stressing and all..  blah...it's not worth the wait...<br>  <br>  My party trick was always to take along some Kamagra,  it's the generic non-brand-name version of Viagra, it'll kick in in about 10 minutes (sooner in chewable form) and you'll be good to go.<br>  It works out at about 2.50 per pill ... absolutely worth it, and I buy from kamagranow.co.uk  (3 batches so far, bout a week for delivery)<br>  <br>  While this is completely legal, and safe, consult a doc first. Mine gave the go ahead... seek help if you're hard for 6 hours, etc...<br>  <br>  Anyway, goodluck getting your rocks off dude!<br>  HFS|`|syLCg7f3aa	All men experience this when they are drinking... there's a name for it and that is "Whiskey D*ck*.

a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	Confront your father about the situation.  Let him know how his sister may have a strong impact on the problems persisting in your home.  Let him think back to when she was living with you and how problems arose, and then think back to when you had a break from her.  Give him examples about certain situations and be honest about how you feel, especially about your mother's health.  Good luck. :]|`|0C8lOe6Faa	tell your father to see what his point of view is and y he thinks their are problems and point out what u think|`|TeailU2iaa	Talk to your father in a soft way, make him understand how you feel about your self, your mother, family etc....

This EXACT same thing happened to me and my family.  Now that my father has passed, my aunt realizes we are her only family and wants a relationship.  I love her, she's family, but she missed a chance to build the relationship with us like we have with our other aunts.  What can I do about that?<br>  <br>  Maybe you should tell your aunt how you see her starting fights and how it makes you feel.  She may think she's slick with her spoiled azz, but maybe hearing a child tell her that she's not slick will change her behavior.<br>  <br>  Also talk to your dad.  Some dads are too stupid to know that their first priority are the wife and kids, NOT grown azz siblings.  Maybe hearing it from you will open his eyes.
X4i2jej5aa	Yes! Either that or she's asking for a friend who mite like u. If you do like her, next time, ask her if she's asking that because she likes u, and when she says yes, then you just fine yourself a new date!<br>  If not, o well, maybe her friend's available.|`|lOR7CH0waa	Nah. Sometimes, I like to ask my guy friend who he likes, but it doesn't mean anything. If she KEEPS asking you, ask her if she's planning on asking whoever it is out for you or something. If she doesn't have a good answer, that could be one of MANY signs. Watch for other signs too besides that.|`|UTYV8Wnraa	yeah the more she asks the more closer she will get to you<br>  <br>  she can also be asking for a friend but if its in a flirty way than she likes you|`|9f3H3xSAaa	yessir.or her friend might.|`|pVVRMPb1aa	maybe|`|rJR0puvmaa	sounds like she likes you|`|pPS2UZ4Aaa	Well they could have rumors that u like someoen<br>  but thats pretty rare and occasionally shes asking u because shes too shy to actually ask u out<br>  mybe u shuld make the move! =) good luckkk|`|wYcrYp7Daa	maybe she just wants to know if u do cuz maybe one of her friends likes you|`|Rk2hxLWkaa	i would say so or if she's a good friend of yours she just might be wondering. i know i ask my close guy friends who they like just cause i'm curious. it doesn't mean that i like them.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	yes there is some there u just have to find out.|`|WKAqqYXEaa	She might be asking for a friend, but it's most likely that she likes you but she wants you to make the first move.|`|3vC2Hklsaa	without a doubt|`|AqCM2q2Haa	Yep i think she do like.. its a 50/50 percent chance but in another way one of her friend might ask her to see if u avaible so she could date you|`|JT10KvVTaa	yes she does like you and she wants to get to know who you like so she can see but yes she does.|`|JMs4RDVxaa	Probably. Tell her to get to the point.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	Ofcourse, and she's not being very suttle about it.|`|7N6F5zEbaa	Probably.  That's usually what I do to find out if a girl is single. ;P|`|6FZFBpahaa	ok probably yes|`|2wZhVA8faa	Well, it could mean that either she likes you... or one of her friends likes you and she's trying to find out if you like them back... =/ good luck!|`|94IWoO6Eaa	Yeah she just wants you to say yes & that its her so do it! haha|`|YevNFgdkaa	Yes i think she does that's what i usually do to see if a boy is interested in me either that shes just trying to be noisy. if you like her tell it might be beneficial|`|a1zhTrHOaa	It could mean so many things<br>  <br>  a-knows about someone that likes you<br>  b-trying to make someone jealous<br>  c-she is asking for a friend<br>  d-she likes you<br>  <br>  those are the most common|`|YfCbn232aa	I would think so. Ive never asked that. But when I ask a guy who they like and they ask why im just like I dont know.

I am going to take a shot and guess that you are in high school or middle school.  This is a good question to answer when trying to figure out the boy/girl dynamic .  The important thing to remember is that when she likes you, you have alot of power.  What matters is how you use that power.

There isn't a magic "correct" number that works for everyone. Discuss it, figure out what works for both of you and then schedule time when you can have couple time without kids around.

Also, I email my children's teachers all the time because kids sometimes are clueless.|`|Rzsudrzqaa	When they're not involved in their childs everyday life, including schoolwork then they're not "parenting"... Of course that kid still need guidance and rules and discipline. You don't just stop parenting when your kid is old enough to do some things on their own. I know how you feel though. I've seen it happen with many kids including myself when I was about 8. I did everything on my own. Luckily I didn't have any issues like falling behind but I do have resentment issues with my parents.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Since you are aware of the fact that your ex and his wife are not telling you anything that is going with your son, including his education you should have the school tell you how your son is doing in school.  He might feel that since his father and his step mother do not care, you may feel the same way and not do anything.  But since you know you need to be an end to him being behind on his school work and push him to do better so he can catch up and stay in the grade he is suppose to be in when he gets older.  Now is the time to make him aware that if he is having problems in school you will be there to help him but only if he lets you know what is going on.  Parenting responsibilitites never end, but since it seems that they are more occumpied with the new baby that is coming someone needs to be responsible for the 11 year old.  Maybe that is how they treat all the kids in the house at this time.  You can bring it to their attention that you are aware of how far behind your son is and you are taking a more proactive role in his life and making sure he gets his work done.  You son should know better in certain things but since he is getting no where with his father and step mother he may have given up.  You ex does not have to tell you everything that is going on in their house unless it has to do with your son, so do not expect that every time they have news good or bad that they will be calling you to tell you about it.  But keep up with your son on your own and help him when you can.|`|PBdPD748aa	i certainly believe that your responsibilities as a parent end only once your child has left the 'nest'. until then, there is still some element of responsibility as they are living under your roof.|`|AA10886262	I wouldn't wait for my son or his father and step mother to tell me what was going on in class, you bet your bottom dollar I'd already know because I would have talked with the teacher....nowadays, homework assignments are posted on the internet.<br>  <br>  Don't depend on his father / step mother to tell you....find out for yourself what is going on with your child's education.<br>  <br>  My girls are both in college and I still remind them they are there to study.....and get good grades or they'll be out, and they won't be mooching off me if they get kicked out or drop out....|`|dQrBlk4qaa	It is the parents' responsibility to be on their kids behinds to do well in school (and life) ALL THE TIME. Your "job as parents" doesn't stop until they're probably thirty - its never to late to make sure your children are up to the job, for Pete's sake. <br>  <br>  So, if you have your kid half the week every week, how did he get 10 assignments behind in school over the past couple of weeks? Sorry to sound like a bit of a jerk, but if your ex is going to slack off, and there's no redeeming his sorry a^^ - it falls on you to ride that kid twice as hard to make sure he doesn't do this. Feel free to beat on your ex for every day he slacks, too!|`|f6YsGOynaa	Sometimes you have to let a child fail in order for him/her to learn something.  It sounds like their parenting style is different from yours, and I'm not sure what you could do to ensure your child's homework is done.  If you have to hover, does that mean he won't ever do anything without you hovering?<br>  <br>  Not trying to be disrespectful, but at 11 years of age, he should know and have consequences for not doing homework.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Your son should be old enough that they don't need to tell you what is going on. He should. He knows how to talk. He knows what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior (I hope). He needs to take responsibility for his actions. You are not responsible for his homework. He is. He may need help some times, but he needs to turn it in.|`|AA10861417	More than likely the new wife feels it is "their" family.  Even though your son is there - she may not feel it is necessary to share these personal things with you.    It is very hard, especially when you are being open.    Keep your comments and questions regarding your son and/or children and see what happens.|`|c63c1a8a3f313613d03647643c55dd58aa	For me....Knowing better ENDS at Graduation.......Be it High School or a University...Beyond that IF their head doesn't get too swollen by interacting in this sorry world of lazy, unproductive, care-less slobs we all live in.<br>  You have my vote.....He is STILL a kid and needs firm daily guidance, not hit and miss slothfulness from SpaceCadet parenting....|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	To answer your question, parenting never ends.  As long as your child is alive, parenting never ends.|`|17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	Unless you are expecting too, and have another 3 kids to take care of, why don't you sit down with your son and do the assignments with him? <br>  <br>  I mean that is your concern, right?<br>  <br>  Though the responsibility as parents is a long term commitment to say the least, there are periods in our lives when there tend to be more important things then one of our kids school assignments, which we all know will not affect our kids future to the better or worse.|`|41d19fc09e68ef3c038357014a85295faa	Ok first you are his mother and should be involved in everything.<br>  Second an 11 year old is still a young child.<br>  And needs guidance in day to day life.Cause if he is not taught now you will have an 18 year old who knows nothing.<br>  Try talking to the school make phone calls and drop by talk to teachers every week.<br>  If you get him half a week every week then you should be involved in the school.<br>  Let them know when you have him and when your ex has him.<br>  if it doesn't improve then you may need a lawyer.|`|AA11180444	If you have your son for half the week, aren't you responsible for him and his assignments too?  Maybe for only half the week but don't you have info from the school too?  If not, I'd be marching into the school and want to know...after all you are half of his legal guardian too.  I wouldn't count on my ex for any information at all.  I left him for a reason....because he's a loser.  I'm guessing that you left yours for a reason too, so why count on him for anything?!?!?!|`|kTBE4dYEaa	an 11 year old still needs guidance and instruction when it comes to responsibility. sometimes you need to force your kid to sit down and do there homework and teach them that sometimes they need to do things they don't want to do to get where they want to go in life. her excuse is rubbish and not doing anything about they overdue assignments is poor parenting on their part.<br>  <br>  i think you should go talk to your ex about how you see your roles as parents at this stage and how you can help each other help your son. with a dialogue like that you can say everything you want without accusing him or starting a fight so that should hopefully achieve everything you want. tell him that you think both of you need to push him harder with his school work and find out why he's not keeping up and you need to discuss what's happened during the times you're not with him so you're both on the same page and he has the same rules at both houses so he knows where he stands.<br>  good luck.|`|rSIF5jtSaa	They NEED to be telling you this...especially if you have him the half the week. If they want to be part of his life, they need to be involved all throughout....not just when convienient. I think that you need to put your foot down and say something. Tell him if they don't want to take the iniative to pay attention to your sons life, you can take custody and give him the attention that he needs.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	If your child is lax in assignments perhaps you could talk with or write back and forth to the teacher or teachers every week.  This way you are taking it upon yourself to find out, and do not have to have expectations of the kid's father.<br>  <br>  that's my best thought on the matter.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	I didn't read the whole thing but I know your responsibility of a parent never ends. They will always be your kids. I the other woman in my situation and this lady's husband talks about this kind stuff all the time.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ShyCBmj5aa	I don't understand why they wouldn't tell you.<br>  To me they are being selfish.<br>  An 11 year old should know better but come on he's 11 not 15.<br>  Plus it's hard starting Middle School.<br>  It's alot diff from elementary.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	I agree with you. An 11 year old still needs a lot of help, supervision & parenting. I don't care how many kids a person has they still need to give each one some individual time. The boy is probably doing this in order to get some attention from his father. The job of parenting actually never stops in my opinion. No matter how old they get, they'll still always be your children & will always need to know their parents care about them.|`|WtmlI1igaa	Never.  I know there are situations where life doesn't go the way you want them but can you get your son or at least spend more time with him that way you can be up on his doings or what he is not doing since there is a lack of supervision. Just remember there maybe a possibility that when he gets older whatever goes wrong in his life he may blame his dad but he will more so resent you since he is with him even though that may somewhat be the best place for him since he is a male.|`|jGCkjJjdaa	It never ends. It sounds to me like they need to stop having more children and deal with the ones they have. One of my sons was bad about doing his work also and he was in high school. And you better believe that I didn't let him get away with it when I found out (from his progress reports). If they don't want to deal with it, they should at least let you know so you can, because evidently you care. Have a talk with his teachers so they can let you know when there is an issue.
a74b14a2df8f491b94ca062ec6bd8e23aa	I gave mine my virginity! We were 18 in love, decided on a whim to go downtown and get married, lol. Seriously though, as a gift, we each bought the other one's wedding rings (but the virginity thing is true too--we were both virgins actually).|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Our honeymoon is our gift to each other. We have had to pay for most of the wedding and all of the honeymoon ourselves, so we decided to get a better hotel room for our honeymoon instead of buying actual gifts for each other.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	The wedding. We paid for it ourselves so we skipped the gifts.|`|AA11434429	I know a lot of people tend to get a nice watch as a wedding present.<br>  <br>  I will probably make something for my FH.

He obviously doesn't care.|`|b1xQKDEraa	it doesnt sound like he is taking the engagement seriously. sit him down and talk to him, tell him it means something to you. if he doesnt appreciate that, then maybe you need to call off the engagement.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	I have no idea, why don't you ask him yourself.  <br>  <br>  Guys don't do subtle, ask him direct.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Sounds like he's having second thoughts. Sit him down and talk to him about it.|`|JtJxVBOsaa	Maybe he just means that he's more about the engagement and marriage. Is he looking for confirmation that you're more about him than the ring? Maybe he thinks you're getting caught up in the ring and wedding planning, and he could use a little love. I think he just means that the ring is only a symbol, and the important part is the engagement itself. He probably wants to hear you say the same thing- that it's not the ring, but the man who gave it.|`|TDLmhGauaa	Ask him why. It could be that he is downplaying the whole engagement because he is slightly embarrassed to be seen as engaged or maybe he is getting nervous because he knows that invariably engagements lead to marriage. If he didn't give you the ring as a gesture of love then maybe he is not worth being with however talk to him and ask him how he really feels.|`|749a8ffbe06fcf93a2aea5684093a78daa	If he is saying it when other people are around, I would assume he is just trying to downplay it because he feels dumb and not macho....or it could be that his guy friends have teased him about it and he is second guessing his idea....<br>  <br>  If he is saying this to you when it's just the two of you, ask him about it. After all, he is going to be your husband someday and you should be able to talk about things that bother, hurt, confuse, or frustrate you. Hopefully he will be honest and tell you what is really bothering him.|`|884v4VhGaa	Because he suggested the engagement, not the engagement ring. <br>  <br>  My fiance was the one who proposed, but it was a near thing. Yes, I was definitely ready enough to get engaged that I'd have proposed, but it doesn't mean that I care about the ring. And I'm the one who wears it.|`|TWwGN6Uzaa	Most men don't get the significance of an engagement ring and feel bitter about spending a lot of money on it.<br>  <br>  Suggest buying something small and simple now and upgrading in a few years.|`|ONrpXr3Raa	cuz he's an a**.|`|3xv4wJrdaa	oh dear, why would you marry this person?!|`|76nTvO4iaa	Either he's acting like a macho jerk or he's having second thoughts about the engagement.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	If it means nothing to him then he does not want to be engaged to you, keep the ring but assume your engagement is off.<br>  Have some pride and let him go, he obviously needs his freedom and he will not make you a good husband thats assuming you even get to plan the wedding.<br>  Dont be a loser like him, be strong and walk away, you have to be wanted to feel good and he clearly does not want you.<br>  Good luck.
tbdPLC1Aaa	Good for you!  Never be a lollipop love(sucker)  Girlfreind, thought she had you so wrapped around her fingers, that she could do as she liked and you would take her back.  Good for you she broke up with you when she did considering in her own words ....she has compared EVERY other man she HAS BEEN WITH to you.   My word; only one year has passed and she's already saying every other man..... you could have gotten an STD or worse AIDS! <br>  Besides true love would never take a year to be missed...usually a couple of hours.  When you really love someone you think about them all the time, wonder what they are doing when you are apart long to be with them and ache to see them.<br>  Cut all ties now.  The life you save may be your own!|`|QMAqzpKEaa	I agree with Leigh. She gave a good answer. I would go one step further and change your number. You don't need calls at 3:30am.

N7gOE1btaa	A scrapbook of your relationship with him.  Put in various pictures and stories.  I don't care how macho he is, deep down he will love it and when he misses you, he can flip the pages and be reminded of how great things are between you two.

You're amazing!<br>  <br>  And it's possible that he DOES like you but isn't sure if you feel the same way so he's being a little cautious.

It makes it easier to move on and not waste your time anymore. :)<br>  <br>  But either way, there is no doubt that he'll be impressed by your initiative.

If this person is the snooty type who only wants money spent on the them, then I would say just get them a gift card to a store they like or Love like everyone else has said. If however this person is laid back and is someone you really care about then make them a coupon book. Depending on who this person is to you depends on what kind of coupons. For instance if its a boyfriend or girlfriend then do something like massages, cleaning there place, laundry, or other stuff. If its a friend, then do something like, one day with just you and him or her, or a night in with just the two of you, with dinner and movies. you get the idea. Hope this helps|`|Flp6vXaNaa	Everyone has good ideas, something made with love or something you can do together to share a special moment.|`|a7LvtYi0aa	they might not be showered with love. remember being wealthy doesn't mean you have everything in life!|`|AKc8EaKTaa	give them love and support and be genuinely caring. many timess these emotions mean so much more than a 10 buck teddy bear
HNEW1gzDaa	talking to her even if she doesnt respond it will comfort her... tell her that you just want to help her and that if she ever wants to talk to someone you are there|`|LOROVDvcaa	if you're around her and she's looking down just go up her her and ask if everything's ok.<br>  "is everything ok?" or "are you ok?" or "are you alright?"<br>  "what's wrong?"<br>  "how are you doing?"<br>  "i'm here if you ever wanna talk about something."<br>  "you look really nice today" (then get into small-talk and see if you can get her to say it on her own.  sometimes just a friend to talk to can brighten someone's day)<br>  "are you always that pretty?"<br>  "can you help me with something?" (then ask her to help you with a homework problem or something)<br>  <br>  anything that gets a conversation going is better then nothing.  if you say one of those things you should be set.  she might not be sad but it never hurts to be nice and find out.  even if she says she's fine just talk to her, don't force anything out of her, just be sweet about everything and hopefully everything will work out well|`|ptWHIVjZaa	Yes, asking her how she was feeling was very sweet and the right thing to do.  Chances are, not many people noticed or cared and she was pretty down in the dumps.  I'm sure she's grateful to have somebody like you in her life.
Qhw6PyJXaa	Well I'm a freshman guy and unfortunately I have several friends that do the same thing. Personally I think that is the worst thing you can do to somebody. Honestly there is no real way to deal with it other then to learn from it. When my gf and I first did it she was scared that I might leave her because that is one of the most common things for males to do afterward. If you want to avoid getting a bad rep do not act like you dont care or else people will assume that you are use to it. Approach the guy and let him know how you feel and walk away. More than likely, later on he will try to make friends with you and get as close with you as you were before and do the same thing over again. Just try to avoid having sex, let your boyfriend think that you are not ready and if your relationship status hasn't changed at all very slowly take it a step further only where you are comfortable, don't make it look like you have it planned and somewhat like you have not done anything like it before. I hope I was helpful.|`|MiurM5Maaa	Omg! same thing happened to me in grade 9.. he was in grade 12! it was such a shitty feeling, i finally let it out to my friends and they helped so much! they understood i liked him, but he was just a huge jerk. Don't be embaressed, it happens quite often trust me!
jNDvvolYaa	I need you to pay attention to what you called it. SELF esteem. You cant give it to her and you can't take it away. If you know she is beautiful, all you can do is encourage. But at some point, you have to put your foot down and tell her that you will not tolerate her defeatist attitude. Can you see that her negative energy is finding its way to you? How can you be uglier than her? You both are beautiful in your own ways. She needs to embrace her beauty and love herself for it. But you cant let her continue to fish for compliments because apparently they are reinforcing anything. The next time she does it, you tell her that you don't appreciate being called a liar and that she can have a pity party but shouldn't look forward to you being there! She's gonna wanna know why you think shes calling you a liar That's when tell her that every time you have called her beautiful, she has come back with the same thing. which basically says you are a liar. Feel me? Give her something to think about.|`|o80aAQV2aa	It sounds like your friend might just trying to milk compliments out of everybody. Keep in touch with her, but make new friends who aren't so skin-deep and shallow. As for thinking of yourself as ugly don't! Everybody is beautiful in their own way.|`|dL6BcJQxaa	Tell her she's ugly sounds like thats what she really wants to hear. People who have Self esteem problems are usually very irritating they tend to stick to the same problem & Q over & over again. If I where u I would hear her out but if she continues talking about how ugly she is just go along w her see what happens maybe that way you can get to the bottom of her problem if not ignorer her. GOOD LUCK|`|qrtHvCk4aa	Ok this could be for two reasons, either A. She is just looking for compliments and wants you to tell her that she is pretty which if this is the case just come out with it and just simply tell her that she is driving you nuts with all of this talk and that you think that she is pretty and that she needs to just stop with it all. Honesty is the best. OR B. Something is going on at her new high school and she doesn't want to tell you about such as a group of girls that are pretty than her and might be picking on her or making her feel left out. Which in this case just try to get the truth out of her and let her know that your her friend and will be there to help her out. Either way you need to tell your friend how you feel or else your going to bottle your feelings up to the point that one day your just going to hash it out on her and ruin your friendship.Hope this helps
NBDLUOkiaa	Oh, you must be speaking of my hot neighbor Jeff that looks finger licking good and even more so on his Harley. Beautiful peppery hair, dark complexion, tall, in his forty's, single.....oh yeah, I would just be busted.Even my husband knows that solid gold watch wouldn't put the smile on my face that 10 minutes alone with Jeff could.

Back in the day you would be just sitting in your respective residences wasting the hours away with each other.  Now phones are just too convenient.  You can catch people at a bad time or talk while doing other tasks.  I love the convenience of cell phones but I find that I have become much more brief since everyone began taking their "residence" with them everywhere.  It's alot easier to get the feeling that someone is calling too much or being invasive when the only way to get away from it is to leave your phone at home.  Then deal with the "why aren't you answering your phone???" later.|`|Ui2uAkD8aa	The phone thing I get...I travel for work and my wife and I just sit on the phone and watch TV togther, and that works for us...you don't have to feel like you're not in a solid relationship if you can't have those three hour phone calls anymore. <br>  <br>  The other part about him not wanting to speak to you when you're fighting is childish. He needs to wipe the sand outta his *** and get over it. It doesn't mean he doesn't love you, he just needs one of his guys to pop him in the head a sort him out.|`|ZeMgxSRLaa	Men and women are very different in matters such as these. If there are other issues in your marriage then you may have other concerns, But, men in general don't like talking on the phone. I know I don't. Men also deal with conflict very differently than women do. I would recommend that you read (or buy the abridged audio version) of Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. It's a great resource for understanding how the opposite sex deals with issues.|`|4uuubr3Haa	im not a guy, but i can answer this anyway<br>  <br>  A lot of men don't like conflict, believe it or not. They will do whatever it takes to AVOID a negative situation. When you are upset, he feels like he's not doing his "job" and it brings him down. There are ways to talk to your man, and show him how to please you (or not piss u off) without being negative. In all honesty, think about it.. how does it make you feel when someone tells you something ur not doing right, or your not doing good enough? Pretty crappy right? so why would he want to hear that from the girl he's in love with? He doesn't. So he avoids it. The more you get upset for the things he's NOT doing (talking on the phone/ discussing problems in a negative tone) the more he will not want to do those things.. ur only making it harder on yourself. <br>  <br>  To answer your question.. what does it say about his feelings? He loves you, and is afraid that if you show him how bad of a boyfriend he is being, u will realize u can have better and then u will leave him.. <br>  <br>  Pretty much.|`|AA11814087	He has a communication problem. How will you get things resolved. Maybe, he does not like the phone, but at some point you have to discuss things.|`|iU1yT9LXaa	he's just not a good communicator!|`|YQOCciU0aa	maybe u r annoying!
wzqahEqiaa	Many people are selfish, base everything on emotions, and don't take commitment seriously.  The "getting whatever I want" and "window shopping" attitudes need to end. I'm tired of society treating relationships and people like everything is disposable. I take promises seriously and I have every intention of keeping my commitments until death.<br>  <br>  The attitude of "as long as it's convenient" doesn't only apply to marriage for some people.  It also applies to friendships, how people treat their parents and elders, and how people treat their children.  Life is tough and not everything is easy and pleasant.  Getting through difficult times can bring people closer.  Life would be a lot easier if people would resolve problems instead of leaving.  I've seen families after divorce that are miserable.  It may have seemed nice after divorce for a short time but it turned into complete chaos.<br>  <br>  My parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years. My grandparents have been faithfully married for almost 60 years. It's possible for marriage to last for a lifetime.|`|AA11967247	then the minister/judge/ordained person can add "by the power invested to me, *to serve a lesser oppressed people"<br>  <br>  i think its a good thing people dont feel guilt about, or have to endure a bad choice and an unpleasant life.|`|CxRJwJsraa	with that thinking, why even bother getting married in the first place.|`|aeLyiRczaa	In the society of today it should be, for most do not care about or have morals.  You see, marriage is designed and defined by God.  But then, most today could care less what God said about anything.  All anyone wants to hear about God anymore is his love and forgiveness.  Other then that, they could care less about what God said.  So, to have those vows would be about right for most in the society of today.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Probably.<br>  <br>  I think people get married these days without any thought or discussion of their futures together.

I wish you all the best and glad to hear your happy about the change.  Some time us as children feel caught in the middle, but you sound like you got a good head on your shoulders : ) Just pack up the things you need when you go to visit the other house.

wSc7ZdBCaa	If you are her BFF then there are only two things that you can do.<br>  <br>  (1) Be "there" for her. LIsten to her and be supportive! Unless she ASKS you for your opinion... do not give advice that could come back on you and bite you in the  _ _ _ ! (Example: they break-up, you say he's a big jerk, you bad mouth him, then... they get back together... now, you're the "friend" that picked on her "true love". Things between you and your friend could become very strained.)<br>  (2) 'IF" you feel very strongly about something OR you are asked your opinion then.... you can do the following: The Eye/"I" statements.<br>  What is that, you ask... Well, <br>  *you make EYE contact with a person.<br>  *You make "I" statements. That means you can ONLY reference yourself. <br>  *(Examples: "I think".....fill in the blank, "I feel"..... fill in the blank, "I want"... fill in the blank, "I need".... etc. "I think he's saying the words you want to hear, but I don't think he's being sincere. I feel you really know what the right thing is for you and when you're ready you'll be able to handle it. I want you to be happy and based on what I see, I don't think this is the person that can do it. I would like you to be honest with yourself so that you can see and think clearly about what's right for you.<br>  <br>  Wishing you great success in helping and learning from your friends so that you will have a happy and loving future.|`|124a0bbcc24398b278b496723141494baa	tell your friend to tell the guy how she feels if he doesn't understand her or respect her he's not worth it.|`|0yh3bcjpaa	tell her to back off for day.<br>  <br>  then have her go buy a stuffed bear that says i love you.<br>  and a card that says something like "i am sorry things have been rough"<br>  <br>  is so cheesy that it will work.|`|LkOcJRRWaa	ummmm, too long...you won't get any answers...seriously!!!!!|`|uvsYrFwTaa	deffinalty talk to her bf<br>  and find out what kinda pickle<br>  is up his a.s.s !<br>  and all you can do<br>  is be the bestest friend<br>  a girl like her needs at this time.<br>  if you still have recess<br>  hes probably not old enough<br>  to be mature enough to stand up to her.<br>  hes just bein a immature boy thats all|`|ww7Mu8n8aa	seek knowledge and wisdom thru god...|`|2AwKt8Peaa	please stay out of your friends business!! thats the best advice i can give you and you'll thank me later for it. :)|`|6fbuFAiraa	Well i think if there falling apart she should just let him go, i have sort of the same thing i really like this guy and he liked me so we started going out and then some stuff happened  and we stopped talking then started talking again but i as not sure if he still likes me, so i told my self until i am sure, we can just be friends.<br>  <br>    So if she thinks they are falling apart, maybe they should just be friends.|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	I would tell her to wait it out.

VSVQHKwKaa	Ok,<br>  <br>  1. Men are not verbal creatures. You're trying to relate to him like you would one of your girlfriends. Your expectations aren't reasonable here. You can't turn a primrose into a pine tree...or vice versa.<br>  <br>  He's a pine tree. He's tall, strong, rigid, and he makes a big mess (needles, acorns, ect) where every he stands. <br>  <br>  You're a primrose. Your soft, sweet, you smell nice, and you have little thorns that can REALLY hurt when you get angry.<br>  <br>  So stop trying to make him into a primrose!<br>  <br>  2. He's tuned you out. <br>  <br>  Men can tune out anything. We can sever our emotional and verbal sides completely if pushed to it.<br>  <br>  You've seen men like this at the mall or at restaurants. Their wives are chattering at them, and they've got this dead, glassy-eyed look like they're stoned. <br>  <br>  In truth, they sort of are stoned. Their mind has learned to drift so far and away, they no longer live in reality. They stare at televisions, at video games, at pornography, and at the sky. They don't live on planet Earth.<br>  <br>  The good news is, a) it's fixable and b) YOU HAVE THE POWER TO FIX IT!<br>  <br>  3. So this is how you fix it:<br>  <br>  -Don't nag, whine, cry, threaten, shout, scream, weep, moan, demand, fuss, groan, or get vindictive. In other words...practice being nice all the time. Yes, this includes when your feelings get hurt. BE NICE!<br>  <br>  -Most men communicate non-verbally. When you want to communicate...TOUCH your man. Touch his neck. Touch his arm. Touch his thigh. Touch his hands. I don't know a guy who won't listen to a woman while getting a back scratch or a neck rub. I don't know a guy who won't connect with his wife when he's just been hugged and kissed, and told how happy she is to see him.<br>  Physical contact is how you stimulate verbal communication.<br>  <br>  -Compliment him! You know why some men love to listen to their wives? BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SOURCE OF THAT MAN'S SELF REGARD!!<br>  So compliment him. Congratulate him! Celebrate his victories. Console his defeats. Remind him that you trust him, you love him, you need him, and you like making him happy.<br>  <br>  -Build rituals! Greet him at the door everyday when he comes home. Let him unwind for about 20 minutes. Give him something to eat (doesn't matter what) or something cool to drink. Kiss him every morning. Smile frankly at him in the shower. Do these things daily, and he'll begin to equate WIFE = HAPPY!!<br>  <br>  -Set a time limit to your endless discussions. Remember, he's only got 1 vocal center in his brain. YOU'VE GOT 4! You speak 4 times as much as he does! <br>  How is he supposed to keep up with you? Why do you resent him for that? Does he resent you because you can't lift heavy objects? Verbally, you're 4 times his size! Cut him some slack!!<br>  <br>  -Also, when women vent, this is what guys hear: "I'M UNHAPPY. I'M UNHAPPY! I'M UNHAPPY. AND IT"S YOUR FAULT! YOU"RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME HAPPY AND I"M NOT HAPPY. FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE!!!"<br>  That's why guys are always interrupting with solutions. They want to solve your problem, but you just want to vent. So now they feel like failures and they are helpless to stop it. You just keep talking and talking and talking and soon they yell "SHUT UP!!!". <br>  Because it's torturous. <br>  So, when you want to vent to him, sit down beside him, touch him somehow (neck rub, back scratch, or just hold hands) and say "Honey, I'm a little bummed out right now. Can I have just 10 minutes to vent a little bit? It'll make me feel much better."<br>  Ah ha! It's not me that she's angry with! She just wants to vent. THAT"S THE PROBLEM!! Solution? Just sit and nod and make soothing noises like "Awww." and "Poor girl!" and "That must have been very hard.". She doesn't want a solution. She wants to bond!<br>  <br>  After you're done, you give him a kiss an thank him for listening. Then he's happy. He did his job. He's a "good boy"! You're happy because he listened to you. You both grew closer. And all you had to do was just ASK to vent and keep it down to 10-15 minutes.<br>  <br>  You've tried to make him into a woman, and because he won't become one and is struggling against you, you're saying he's "selfish"?<br>  <br>  He may be selfish for other reasons, but not for that. That's call "normal".<br>  <br>  Also, get some girlfriends that you can vent to a little bit. Your husband isn't a Oprah. He's not built to take verbal onslaughts. But 3 or 4 girlfriends can chat over a weekend and make each other feel much better and happier. <br>  <br>  You need to start treating him, not like a girl, but like a MAN. He has MAN wants, MAN needs, and MAN points of view. He has MAN weakness (toilet seat, bake goods, rough sex) and MAN strengths (works hard, defends the home, rough sex!!). <br>  <br>  He's a MAN! MAN! MAAAAAAAANNNN! Boy-creature. Circle with the arrow pointed out of the side. Mars. Thor. Conan. Tim Allen. Slugs and snails and puppy dog tails. Power tools. Shot guns. Red meat. Charbroiled. Head butting. Football. Sleeping in Sundays. Loud burps.<br>  <br>  So treat him like a man. And he'll start treating you like a woman. <br>  <br>  You've got all the power! GL!|`|veZLfnGFaa	Sounds like he has problems - has he always been like this or just recently?  Apparently, you've been married for awhile since you have a 12 year old.

Dress-up really sexy in high heels and cook him a wonderful dinner one of his favorite meals, the table set-up for two, have a bottle of wine ready to be poured, the lights low, or candle light dinner, and after dinner have a nice hot bath/shower waiting for him and after the shower give a nice body massage and start talking and romancing the night away.  In order to be shown love you've got to give and shown love and I hope you both enjoy each other again don't lose the romance in your marriage because you have children to take care-of your man needs to be taken care of too and so do you.

I am having the same problem with my husband.  We have been married for 16 years and there have been some rocky times.  His favorite way of not engaging with me is withdrawing like your husband has been.  It wouldn't help if I got up into his face or tried to be understanding.<br>  <br>  It's a brick wall defense of some kind.  If this is new behavior then you need to question it at a moment when he can't back down, and if he still responds that way try to persist by being very direct.  For example, 'When you clam up like that, it makes me feel ______.  If there is a problem I need to know what it is and if we can resolve it.'<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for me, my husband won't cooperate even with a direct approach.  It is to the point of being abusive on his part.  I don't know what is up his sleeve, but it makes me think the marriage is going to have a hard time to recover.<br>  <br>  I wish I had better advise, but make sure that you take care of you and the kids first, try to lessen your stress about the situation and realize you are not giving the silent treatment.  Read some books on how to communicate to make sure you are not getting on his nerves.<br>  <br>  I guess that's about all I can say.  Except - I feel your pain.<br>  <br>  Take care.
56bNLJykaa	It may feel as if you are a loner, like you are the sole-focus of attention when you walk in- but believe me, no one cares- especially guys. There is a girl I see every day who only has one good friend, and when she is not with her she walks past the cafeteria alone to go into the library. Not only does no one notice (or at least mention anything about it), but we know she only has one good friend and do not care. She happens to be very pretty, and the fact that she is by herself makes it easier to approach and get to know her. <br>  <br>  Do not let this be the reason for switching schools, focus on your academics first. If you are 13, it is likely to only become tougher in high school. The important thing is that you don't let it bother you- and even if it does, pretend you are bigger than that, that you feel totally comfortable being alone. Have confidence in yourself and others.<br>  <br>  Experience|`|BNRhUbuuaa	aw that's the situation i'm in. well, you can try to join in one of your friends. if they won't accept you, then that's their loss. just find another group! good luck!?|`|1szv7oUlaa	you sound like a really nice person <br>  but switching to another school wont help you because you said that you didnt want to fit in <br>  so how would it be different on the other hand you may meet people there that you will be willing to talk to and hang out with at lunch<br>  <br>  also if you think about it lunch is not a very long part of the day so going to the library to finish your work isnt such a bad idea :D<br>  <br>  well its all up to you anyways so good luck and i hope this helped <br>  <br>  :DD|`|kHPUFAqaaa	there's nothing wrong with sitting in the library during lunch and there's really no such thing as loners or dorks. their just names that people call other people that contribute to all the cliques and stuff. but if you feel like a loner sitting in the library, just sit with someone you talk to in your classes during lunch.|`|EKDnnFupaa	Thats my life too<br>  enjoy. it never changes|`|84f5f67cd4367e07f59912a3c0130a7baa	There's nothing wrong with going to the library. It doesn't make you a dork or a loner (actually it makes you smart - you get your work done and have the rest of the day to yourself). <br>  <br>  Just be yourself and do what makes you comfortable. If you're not into going to the lunch room, then don't. You don't have to be anything for anyone else or try to fit anyone's mold. Just be true to you, which it sounds like you're doing. Years from now, you will be the victor. You may feel awkward now but that will pass. Trust me. I've been there. If you have a friend with the same lunch time, you could meet a couple times a week. Lunch was always my worst period. The kids are nuts in there. I used to go to the library with some friends or met in an empty classroom. Good luck.
AA11456169	He tried to set you up with his friend to see if you would. if you said no, he'd know you were into him. Its of way of finding out wether or not you like him b4 he puts himself out there.

wSc7ZdBCaa	Yes, you did the right thing. <br>  No matter who you "like" or are interested in, the very best thing you can do for YOURSELF and others is to: "BE HONEST"!!!<br>  Sure, it's scary when you really care about someone to put yourself "out there", but how will you really KNOW anything is real if you don't ask?<br>  You really don't have anything to lose by saying what you "think, feel, want, need". <br>  He's not in the "middle" anymore than you are. The smart thing to do is for both of you to see, be and make other friends. You've got a lot on your plate right now. You're trying to help your Mom and take care of yourself, too. You need to focus on what's right for you. <br>  Go ahead and be "pen pals" = email buddies... that's perfectly ok.<br>  Look around you and see who and what is out there that you are interested in. Reach out to others by being yourself... if you are a good person who takes care of herself first and then her loved ones... you'll do the right thing, feel good about yourself and have an expanded base of people who care about you and that you care about. Remember, everything happens for a reason. We may not know or learn what the reason is right away but when something is "meant to be", it will happen (sometimes when you least expect it.).<br>  Wishing you a future filled with many friends, adventures and happiness.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	You only did the right thing if that's how you really feel.  If you're ok with him dating other people then yeah....but if you aren't then you shouldn't of said it if you think thats what he wanted to hear.<br>  <br>  Tell him how you really feel.  If you want to stay with him then say you wanna make it work and that you'll find a way for it to work.  If you think you both should take a break then say it.  Just be real honest.

Maybe after awhile you two can start hanging out or something. :)|`|LFwtv0soaa	well it depends where?? at school? i wouldn't but if it's like on the streets then maybe a bit creepy lol|`|cW0wAV1caa	no...not at all... i would actually talk back lolz...it can be exciting:)|`|4wQffufZaa	no<br>  just as long as he doesnt come off as perverted|`|xs5J6VJTaa	No.It's called flirting and trying to pick up. How else, besides through friends, do you think people get together?|`|euNkF9e8aa	it would really depend where, and what he was talking about lol|`|w3M20d1Eaa	It would depend where.  Probably not.  I mean, if a random guy came up and was like "hey, what's your number," yes, I would be creeped, but if he started a real conversation, then no.  Also, if I were waiting in line at Starbucks or somewhere near him, at a party, waiting for something to start, just anywhere involving standing and waiting and doing nothing, I wouldn't mind.  What I love is when I'm at an amusement park or something with my friends and a guy or group of guys (or just group of people) who is near us in line for a ride kind of joins our group for the rest of the day.|`|U4cYbkNQaa	No, Im from the South and if a man didn't want to talk to me, I would take that as an insult. If you are from a part of the country that you don't show emotion or aren't very touchy feely, then maybe you would be reserved about how you approach someone. Oh, and it depends on how he looks. You can generally tell if someone is "out there."|`|rhvA4G4Paa	ehhh, depends on where it is<br>  <br>  like at the mall-yes!<br>  at school-not so much..|`|etD7kjE7aa	if hes hot ill talk back, if not ima liz ma lipz|`|xV672tJcaa	No, I don't think so... Unless he's stalker-ish in character. That would creep me out. I think starting out a conversation with a joke is a good way to start a conversation with someone you don't know...|`|Bd4cGbEXaa	nope i would talk back|`|XUSiJjZaaa	definitely not this would be a sign of bravery and guts<br>  if a guy i didnt no came up and talked to me i wouldnt be creeped out<br>  just dont use any lame pick up lines just say something witty and humorous <br>  good luck <br>  NO lame pick ups|`|U5dCFomCaa	depends on my mood. i'd be like.. 'okay..' but flattered :D|`|a5jLi0S6aa	no. unless he looked socially unacceptable.<br>  i would be flattered. if hes cute i wouldnt be able to talk to him, id be so embarassed by his cuteness|`|9jiHVKpOaa	Well are you asking if some radon guys came up to me or like someone i see around school??<br>  <br>  random guy creepy and i would walk away!<br>  guy from school i would talk to him|`|QkkKs9Veaa	noo , not really. <br>  im shy myself too! <br>  so take  a chance and talk to them.<br>  Make small talks first. then later bigger convo.|`|wXCT4bbSaa	no id be like "who exactly are you" if he didn't tell me his name right off the bat, but it wuldn't be creepy at all|`|UTYV8Wnraa	not really,, but if they knows you somehow and u have a reputation by being perverted...then maybe<br>  <br>  <br>  but mostly know|`|YZv4rOJ7aa	if you never talked to people you don't know - you'd never have friends, etc.|`|X4i2jej5aa	yes, if you were talking to me online. And no, if you were talking to me in real life.|`|DovGtQ1jaa	Depends on what he says|`|tZm7EtG3aa	NO|`|dARgbG8Saa	if they are sceezy it would be creepy ....but if you are chill and clean its okay.. i personally like it when guys come to me and introduce thereself and then proceed to ask my name ..then when i see them some where im like hey so and so ....and you just get closer that way ... or if you meet through a friend thats cool too..|`|eNKyRGXDaa	if he was weird looking ya i'd be creeped...:D|`|TPP0p13faa	it depends on the situation if he just comes up to me and starts babbling about nothing then yea i mite be a lil creeped out. but if we'ere in a social setting or if he plays it cool then most likely i'd talk back.|`|i7Y2RzCaaa	that happened to me in the lunch line but i was creeped out because he started talking about asking me out for a guy i like and then asked if i was alowwed to date soooo yeah i find it very creepy|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	no not unless your 15 and he's 50 lol|`|sRpX2TFIaa	no id talk back :)|`|olwIfFj6aa	Don't talk sex<br>  Home Address<br>  Personal Information<br>  <br>  I would find it creepy, but I rather just speak back because I don't want the person to re-act negaitively.|`|oungTF5Baa	it depends on what he looks like... i no shallow but if he is nice i will def talk back. :p|`|1OQKJ2jraa	not at all, how else are you suppose to meet new people.<br>  As long as you are not creepy looking and don't do it in a creepy way.|`|6fbuFAiraa	UM, if he is talking about stuff that makes me feel uncomfortable then i would walk away, but i he is nice to me i would talk back|`|oY4Asqdpaa	nope! i get this every day lol! even online i get a guy trying to chat! yes i enjoy it- i don't find it creepy! :)|`|1373f16ca548e46551d5742d5452731faa	not unless it was the streets or online|`|LXc40o8Faa	Well, it depends on how old you are & how old the girl you're talking to is.|`|dUo22Lnlaa	Yep!

ac5cae42522c610efcafebeda6a6ba85aa	If you're comfortable enough with your boyfriend/husband, then I suggest that you have sex in front of a mirror so you can actually see what you're doing.  It's kind of like throwing you in the deep end of the pool when you're just learning to swim, but it'll get your shyness out of the way and HE might think it's pretty damn hot as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
naequcqlaa	This ans. is actually for "redhead2"...What are YOU on here for?  To be able to actually "help" people or to throw stones at them!  That sure was NOT an "encouraging" ans. to give to anyone, in fact what you actually said would have been better left UNSAID at all.  Most of "us" are on here to help others & do the best we can in order to be able to give them encouragement, not throw them on the ground & step all over them.  My I NEVER have a need or a question & expect a kind word to come from you!  Don't you in all fairness agree to what you did say would have been better left unsaid period?!  But then like I've always said, thank God we're NOT all alike, because there are a LOT of people I'm glad I'm not like.  It's kindness that goes a LONG WAY, not putting someone down regardless of who they are, or the nature of their post.  How about putting yourself in the position of the person in need instead of tramping all over them.  Sorry, but obviously, I'm not impressed by your attitude twds. others....Trust IF you ever have a need of any kind, someone w/say something to help you w/words of kindness. And to Stacey, distance yourself from him & take this "person" completely out of your life & I KNOW you'll find you've finally gotten rid of your problem FOR GOOD...IF you have a thorn in your hand, it hurts, when you remove it the hurt is ALL GONE.

It was so hard just looking at him we couldn't touch the only contact we had was when you walked in you were allowed a quick kiss before and after that was it. Everything was going great he only had two weeks to go i was so excided. With two weeks left he called me before visiting day and said not to bother coming to visit him tomorrow when i ask why he said it was over between us. I couldn't believe what i was hearing i ask him what was wrong he just said again that it was over and that he didn't love me and he hung up. Needless to say i was devastated and heart broken i wanted to know what happen. I did go to see him but when i got there and tried to sign in they said he already had his visit for the week and it was yesterday the very same day he called to tell me it was over. I looked down at the names on the sign in book it was his room mates sister who signed in to see my boyfriend it took everything i had not to bust out crying. We were dating for over a year and we were going to get a place together when he got out. My boyfriend saw her one Saturday when i was there visiting him she was visiting her bother. I remember him telling me that that guy was in the same cell with him and that must be his sister. I remember feeling something was wrong back then because he kept looking over at her. I now know he started writing her two months after he was put in jail  what a scum bag. He was just all warm and loving towards me because i was putting money in his account and i would write a letter each and everyday so he would get mail.He used me almost the whole time he was in jail knowing when he got out he had a whole new life planned and it didn't included me. When guys are in jail they will not break up with you unless they have someone else to take your place that's just a fact and i think that's what your husband is doing to you sorry to say. Looking back now i am so glad he didn't want to see me anymore because i probably wouldn't have met my husband who i love and adore more then anything. I would take this as a sign that you two are not meant to be and there is a mister right out there just waiting for you.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	What kind of advice are you looking for! He does not want you and you say you don't want him, why did you go to see him? and you want to know why he came out to see you, Who cares, and why are you with a man that is in jail, and that degrades you, You bothe need help.and maybe talk to a minister,,,,,|`|veZLfnGFaa	You get mad.  Don't' be hurt - be mad.  He treats you so bad and you just keep asking for more.  Don't visit him, take his calls or anything.  You deserve better than this man.  What has he done but hurt you?   If nothing else, think more of yourself and get out while you can.  Maybe there's more reasons than one why he's in jail.  This might just be your chance to break free and start a new life.  Please give it a try and see if you don't feel better.  Good Luck :)
1nnW8cCjaa	Every relationship goes through its ups & downs. It does not mean he is cheating on you. If he lost his job, he could be depressed. There are so many layoffs today. But it does not sound like he is being considerate of you & that is not right. Try talking to him to see if he wants to stay together & discuss what you want. If it is not something that can be worked out, you may have to move on. I wish you all the best! <br>  If your husband did lose his job, I recommend he start a home based business. There is no job security today. Check out: <a href="http://www.SignificantIncomeCapability.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.SignificantIncomeCapability.c...</a> I wish you all the best!|`|YbCISxYZaa	something has got to be happening why don't you confront him about it
EKDnnFupaa	This is normal behavior for girls. This sounds crazy, but believe me.<br>  If a girl makes you stressed or unhappy, just act as if they aren't stressing you at all. When you know they are around, ignore them unless they say something then just be funny but polite. and make a big show of talking with your friends, as if they arent even there. it drives girls CRAZY<br>  i did this last year, by the end of the year I had 3 girls beating my door down and fighting over me.<br>  I ain't no sport star or realy good looker either, believe you me, it works.|`|zq86VbpMaa	Maybe she thinks your like stalking her and she needs her space. You should lay off for a bit 'till she feels better.|`|M1B1EvI7aa	woow she's messed up =S<br>  come on you didnt even say more than 2 words so what does she have to be angry about?<br>  try and ask her what you did if she just wont talk to you than just forget her|`|9yPEjN4Xaa	She's hot and cold.

She does not seem to want to be friends with U, so move on and enjoy life. It's a big world out there. Do not stress over her -- not worth it.|`|a9158ed922422742a841f62fbf1b64d6aa	Hmmm, I honestly think she decided to give you a chance again, but after she started talking to you again, she realized she didn't want to talk to you. Even though that sounds cruel, sometimes it's how nice people try to give you a hint. They don't want to say it outright to hurt you face-to-face, but they do stuff that gives you a huge hint. Unless you want her to really say it out loud, I think you should really just ignore her because she needs more time and space. I know it's really hard, since you like her, but if she doesn't like you back and you try talking to her a lot, she'll just get the impression that you're desperate and NEVER want to talk you again! <br>  <br>  Sorry for the devastating answer, but a guy used to stalk me, and even though I didn't want to hurt him, I guess I tried to hide from him because he scared me. I don't think you're that type of guy, but I honestly think just leaving her alone will do the trick. You definitely don't want her to talk behind your back, telling her friends that you don't get the hint or stuff like that. Find somebody who appreciates you to like :) (even though it's not that easy). <br>  <br>  Good luck!!! You'll meet someone better soon enough!

I think you're family is focusing on this because it's new, and maybe was unpredicted.  Everyone is going to have to get used to him being gay.  Your family, and people hopefully will accept him, for his gay life and all.<br>  <br>  As for you, heartbreak is the absolute worst pain.  But, it's not going to turn you gay.  You're gay, if you're gay.  Not because it didn't work out with a woman.  You're still so young and I know you will find another woman that you can love, and will love you back.<br>  <br>  It just sounds like all these events happened at once.  So, I imagine it's a bit overwhelming.  But, they are separate things.  You're cousin is gay - ok - worse things out there.  You got your heart broken.  You will heal.  Just give yourself some time and this will work its way out, I promise.|`|KpxVsPZSaa	get over it. his a normal person. my cousin is gay as well there is nothing you could do. <br>  gay people are so nice to talk to|`|bXX9HjS4aa	I understand that it is something different, especially because you didn't expect it. My best friend of like 12 years is bi and she didn't tell me until about 2 years ago and at first I did feel a little uneasy just because I wasn't expecting it. But, just let the talk die down, there is nothing wrong with people being gay just like there is nothing wrong with being straight. Just realize that it is not your life so you don't have to really deal with it.|`|iOv9tbULaa	I think instead of being afraid- face your fear. Ask your cousin some questions and hang out with him, not in any places you feel unconfortable. Ask him what it's all about. Then you may know for sure if that's what you choose. <br>  <br>  Stop trying to defend yoursef with I know I will NEVER and all this because that's just not guarenteed with anyone. It's not like you can't go back to being straight if you did choose to go gay.<br>  <br>  It does scare people when they think they're straight and maybe they have some doubts about their sexuality. Its normal. Shows you got a real sexual drive. But, the choice on whether you actually go through with being gay is all your own. <br>  <br>  Personally, I dont like the fact that gay people put it all out there because its like they're asking to be challenged. Maybe it feels liberating after being in the closet for so long, but at the end of the day I wish straight, homosexual, bi whatever would keep their stuff to themselves, because I think its meant to only be known between you and whoever you do it with it,...<br>  <br>  If that doesn't help, go talk to a psychologist at school about it. That may help. They may have good ideas.<br>  <br>  If you like this answer the most, by all means give me best answer. LOL|`|AA11540287	Well you don't turn gay lol... I don't see what your cousin sexuality has to do with your status with other females.  Your confusion, is confusing me.|`|aZojNNjaaa	omg get over it. live your own life. why does your cousins sexuality bother you? would you care so much about who he was having sex with, if they were girls? no.|`|vzr8S8vVaa	His a person too man.. Who cares his gay his ur family member respect him like he respect u|`|PofywTuhaa	Live with it. I'm sure hes feeling sad and crap because everyones talking **** about him and its allover his facebook. Ok you dont agree. No big deal. Support him. <br>  <br>  Ok so its gonna be some time to "adjest" to. No you dont have to be worried. Its family. You love them for better or for worse.<br>  <br>  And hey- theres a plus here. When you need help with girls a gay guy is the best person to go to next to a lady.

No one is even developed at that age--mentally, physically, or emotional.|`|UTYV8Wnraa	its illegal i think|`|1OQKJ2jraa	no, if you are 18 you should date 18 or older, and 17 the youngest should be 16 by law, at least where I'm at.|`|DovGtQ1jaa	You can have a relationship and DATE at any age|`|YIJRZhoSaa	18<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doreplica.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.doreplica.com</a>|`|EAlIwQxCaa	no you have to be like 17 or 16 and a half or its considered statutory rape|`|zNkvHpUQaa	nope.<br>  their both illegal|`|YtFxiT6haa	Relationships aren't illegal no matter the age.  Maybe not normal or socially acceptable, but not illegal.<br>  <br>  now, sexual relationships are illegal if the person is 18 years of age and the other is a minor. If both are a minor, sexual relationships are illegal if the two are 3 years apart in age.|`|Icnpb6V9aa	NOOO! YOU CAN DATE ANYONE YOU WANT!

VzXo4DDZaa	Let me ask you 1 question<br>  How can you get ur A$$ fired? <br>  The answer is by asking the question u ve just asked!|`|84f5f67cd4367e07f59912a3c0130a7baa	You need to have an honest talk with her. Tell her that you know she's going through a rough time but there are times when you need her assistance to do your job and is there some kind of signal you can give her to get her attention. Good luck.|`|eW78c00Daa	You are in a no-win situation.  She owns the store!  Start looking for another job.  One of the good things about being in the health care field is that you are in demand.  When you give your two week notice make sure you let her know why you are leaving, but be professional about it.
9yPEjN4Xaa	The perfect prank is to walk away from it all.

You need to get these girls back with one good revenge prank or like a week of torture, but dont be a total *****. I suggest during art class that maybee you give them some period stains.  Be the last out of the change room and spray their clothes wih the grossest smelling stuff ever. Maybee get  a couple older guys to hit on them like just walk up and say "she wants you soooo bad" and have everyone think that they are in love with the creepy. Or have the jock reject them in front of everyone! <br>  <br>  <br>  yea im pretty twisted.|`|FgKecGFtaa	LEAVE IT ALONE BE THE BIGGER PERSON
SJHyNjlRaa	I think it's not so much the clothes, (good jeans and cute tops will do) as much as the accessories. Remember she is just 10, so maybe some funky jewelry, and nail polish and fun shoes. Plus a hairstylist should be able to help in the hair department as to what the easiest style would be for her to keep. Good luck!|`|TeailU2iaa	You don't have to buy your sister dresses or make her hair cuts to boost her confident. One thing you can do is you can let her know that her elder sister will stand by her forever. You must make her feel that you will be there for her no matter what. Talk to her nicely make her understand that she will be supported by you always. It will make her more confident.<br>  <br>  I am not good in fashions etc.... since you've asked i got this link from google.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairstylesdesign.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstylesdesign.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ukhairdressers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukhairdressers.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/</a>

kKxpKuI6aa	i used to ask myself that all the time. when i was ready to start making some guy friends i always brought along my bff. i used to be shy so it felt uncomfortable to be alone with a guy. i just talked to them like i would to any other person and flirted a little every once in a while. eventually i got more comfortable and im able to talk to guys without being uncomfortable...i can even talk to them when im alone. now im not as shy as i was before...all it takes is time and practice|`|g8bgfY0Aaa	Well here's how I did it. I say something to them, like having to do with the situation (not like random)  Then, they tell me I'm hott and it turns out that we become friends, because they know I don't want a relationship with my friend !

Even if you just wanan be friends. Guys like outgoing girls who just put themselves out there. I dont mean like slutty, i mean just like girls who dont hold back. Get in conversations with them, make jokes, laugh at their jokes, and let them come to you. Its almsot like dating but different. Dont be the one asking for their number because that comes off eager. If they wanna be your friend they'll ask for yours in time.|`|F5Yb7PDvaa	tlk to them, flirt a little, give them your number, share your interests, find anything to tlk about, same as girls :)
RnQFwIuUaa	I think that would be ok to say.

ac5cae42522c610efcafebeda6a6ba85aa	Sadly, yes, people will most likely think you're a wuss.  It's the best course of action, but then everyone will know that picking on you will just make you run away and you'll be running from fights forever.<br>  <br>  Stand your ground.

People like to hide behind their fists, and shouting in order to be "heard" but it's actually a cry for help. Walking away from situations such as physical violence shows, you're mature enough to realize having a misdemeaner on your record isn't worth the aggrivation of fighting. Stand up for yourself, (verbally) whatever you believe in, scars can go away, words will impact people forever
P2sZXK72aa	If you really like this girl then you're gonna want her father to approve of you. The best way of doing this is being a mature individual who respects his rules. I would suggest you don't hold her hand but instead come to her father like a man and express your interest in her. Tell him he raised a very nice young lady and that you would like to have permission to either take her out or come over to dinner one night and eat with the family or you could study together while he is home. This way he will come to trust you and appreciate that you are respectful, while on the other hand the girl will like you more for showing so much interest and winning over her father.|`|F85itiPVaa	Riley- This is your Mom. I think you should hold her hand, but only if she wants you to. Don't force it. Also, you should know that I would not be upset with you if you did. What was Kens warning and why haven't you said anything about it? We live in the same house and you could easily talk to me about it. You know, you're only 12 and you have years for this stuff, but we'll talk about that later. I hope that this clarifies some questions that you may have about hand holding. I don't think I would be mad if you even kissed her, but she may not want to and I know that you would definitely be spending some time in the Principals office :( I will see you after school.<br>  I also like arties answer. Ask for permission from Ken first.|`|bZiqrbmGaa	Well that sucks.<br>  Love/friendship shouldn't be abstained.<br>  Hard to tell but hold her hand when he's not around.<br>  Exactly how old are you guys?<br>  <br>  Do what you think is right.<br>    - If you really like her, show her father that you're responsible and<br>      caring for her.|`|8g3Uz6PCaa	u could date her over the summer when he isnt ur principal lol. if u like the chick then hold her hand, but if u dont want to get in trouble then dont its that easy|`|kM7DJZ9Oaa	not around him :b but only do it if she wants to. :]]]]|`|m6G5CuLVaa	Do it!

Or do you create problems at school and he wants you to stay far away from her?<br>  <br>  You're in a tough situation. I mean her dad has the potential to know everything that happens with you and his daughter since he's the principal. I don't know that I'd do something that will be noticed...and hand holding will be. Maybe if it's not on school grounds. Or you could always be a respectable gentlemen, and go to her dad and ask him if it's okay if you were to call her at night. Then he'd think you were respectful of his wishes, and most importantly of his daughter.|`|9yPEjN4Xaa	Be her friend first. Show her dad you have good intentions. Let him get to know you. After you've spent some time doing that steal a hand hold in private. You don't need to walk down the halls holding hands. Unless it's a religious thing with her dad then I would wait until you are both old enough to stand against that wish.|`|Tuk33Ml6aa	I think u should do it anyway.

I'll call him John.  John had a friend I'll call Tom who was not nearly as attractive, but he was a nice guy. Tom was funny, easy going and easy to talk to. John on the other hand didn't have above two words to say to anyone unless Tom was around. When Tom got attention from girls, John would get huffy and say things like, "Why are you always talking to him. I know I look much better than him!"<br>  <br>  It shouldn't have to be pointed out, but John didn't seem to realize that his attitude had a lot to do with why he didn't get any play. Sure, good looks will initially get you attention, but once a person opens his or her mouth, that's the deal breaker.

Is he open to his feelings? Or the quiet type? If he's the first type, then its not enough. If its the second, then its should be more than enough for it takes a lot of courage to say iloveyou for a quiet man, just like me. But then again, as the old saying goes, Love is more expressed in actions, not in words.|`|D3ubQMicaa	It is one thing to say that you love someone, but what is more important is showing it. There is definitely nothing wrong with saying I love you, as long as it's not being said as a trivial thing. That said, some guys just aren't as good at expressing their feelings, and they fall back to the simplistic "i love you". If you have no other reason to doubt other than that he keeps saying i love you, ask yourself why you think he might be trying to hide something. <br>  <br>  If you still can't shake the suspicions, you should talk to him about it.|`|mBecsG1Zaa	before thinking that the person really likes and loves you, make sure that he does. because its difficult if you will make yourself believe that that person really loves you.<br>  <br>  maybe he just adores you alot that's why he keeps on saying iloveyou. dont let that guy see or feel that you are an easy-to-get lady. :)<br>  <br>  avoid first the affection that you can give to him. be really sure that you can receive the love that you'll be expecting from him.:)<br>  <br>  its not enough yet, both of you are not yet boyfriends or girlfriends. wait until he deserves your love and from there, saying iloveyou to you is not enough, you must feel it. and take note, having sex if not a strong prove that he really loves you.<br>  <br>   :). have a healthy heart to avoid heartaches :)

Anyone who finds out what he is doing can report him. He's an adult and should know better. If you choose to date him, be sure there is nothing sexual going on.|`|fmkwdNJyaa	The law is stay away from him and leave him for someone else within his age range and vice versa.......itss illegal and you are jail bate until 18, regardless of sexual relationships-it's the same thing|`|ulO3556jaa	fu ck the law anyway.

He is committing rape because you are under the age of consent.  In the eyes of the law, if you are under age 18, it is assumed you don't know what you are doing if you agres to sex with someone over the age of 18.    Therefore, the older person is held responsible for rape.<br>  <br>  He might be ignorant of the law, so best advise to you is don't have sex until you are 18.     Once you are both at age of consent, the law does not apply.|`|PiWdj26jaa	Not to get caught and to use a condom!|`|AA11296241	do not have sex. you will end up in jail.|`|vPjbSBhJaa	You must specify which state you live in if you are in the U.S. A lot of people will give you baloney answers if you don't.

Totally illigal|`|yThh1nXYaa	It is statutory rape, even if you consent. Depending on if he has previous charges he could serve time. Most likely he will pay a fine, be on probation for a year or 2 and it will be on his record forever.|`|XwyUATsKaa	He is unfortunately too old for you according to many state laws.  I went through this however.  Just make sure your parents know about this relationship.|`|9797TRA2aa	You could get caught and might get penalties I'm not too sure of. Its because they're over 18 and you're not. Try having a sexual relationship once you turn 18, just to be safe.|`|RvmYjI0Aaa	if your 16, you can date anyone up to 24 where I live|`|nuM1IJ7taa	not allowed.|`|S7lbCjUMaa	Well your friend could be charged with Statutory Rape. In my state the minor and the adult have to be no more than two years apart in age, so that would mean that he would have to be 18 and you would have to be 16. Also 16 is the legal age of consent which im sure you know already. i hope i helped.|`|1ZEYIsPAaa	You won't get in trouble, but he may go to jail! Ask yourself why someone that should be in College is still dating girls in High School? I know it seems cool now, but in 10 years you will wonder this same question.

Please enjoy your High School years cause you can't get them back.|`|jtuOaKWqaa	I am pretty sure that you have to be 18 for almost everything, including that, i am from NY and here it can be treated like a crime.

You put a teddy in a box and wrap it several times. We used different wrapping papers to distinguish each layer. You sit in a circle and pass the box as the music plays. When the music stops, you unwrap one layer of paper. The person to unwrap the last layer must model the teddy for the whole group. Have her go into the other room to open the box. When she does, instead of a racy piece of lingerie, she will find a teddy bear. It's a really fun, clean game. We had a great time with it!|`|Ly58Wxqfaa	you should play party corks.. its where each person except ofr the guesser,  is chosen a definate role, such as germophobic or dancer, and everything that is being done should be part of that role. The guesser or host of the party leaves the room when everyone picks their roles and then comes back into the room when everyone is done. The object of the game is to have the party host guess all the roles of all the guests. It is really fun, be creative!|`|okp0CMc3aa	OK, you need 2 pairs of pantyhose & 4 oranges. put an orange down one leg of the pantyhose & tie the other one around your waist. then swing the orange in the stocking between your knees in order to hit the other orange, & have a race like that. i think its called the *Shlong swing*<br>  another is to get people to partner up, then blindfold one person, stick 5 clothespins in random places all over their partner, & get them to feel them up to find them. whoever finds the five pins first wins(against another pair of partners)<br>  another is to partner up again, have one row on one side of the room with plungers between their knees & the others with toilet papr rolls between theirs on the other side, get them to walk towards eachother & try to get the roll on the handle.<br>  all three of these games are hilarious!!|`|pVgWZG7jaa	lol....you can do truth or dare!  It can be all things relationship related!   You can bob for scrotums: put some balls in a couple of bowls and see who can bob the fastest!  Think sexually!  that's what a bach party is about...you can buy molds of clay and have a contest on who can mold the best penis and vagina!|`|gRXy66dOaa	play monoply
ki8P8bYfaa	You've kinda put yourself in a rut by giving yourself a rep.  Once you've got one, you can't get out of it.  But I suppose it won't hurt to try.  Let off a little on the jokes and stay serious for once...or twice...or more.  Make a few jokes in class, but you have to know when to stop, otherwise girls will think all you do is joke around.  So, basically, just let up on the joking and answer a few questions correctly and maturely in class.|`|ejrxNVD1aa	lol if youre into long-term relationships act serious kinda when u start a conversation|`|fmkwdNJyaa	don't ALWAYS be predictable in being the clown.....show your serious side one in a while when in class or otherwise.........this is generally a rule for life, first impression means so much and some people really hold on to that but you can chane their perception..don't over-do your joking around|`|IKoagU4Daa	Show them that you can be serious, one-on-one...
f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	He is shy and probably gets like this around a bunch of different girls. He is just having a tiny sort of anxiety attack. Try to just be your self and let him have time to adjust. This may take a few weeks.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	He likes you...CAT FIGHT!!|`|AA10904025	He could just be one of those people with a weird breathing thing. I work with a sigher and trust me, it is a little pyscho watching you get out of the shower thru your bathroom window. But he might not be aware or able to help it. Chalk it up to being one of those things you'll laugh about over drinks if they break up.|`|jB2p4fSmaa	Lol i do the same thing! He tries not to breath on yuo cuz hes afraid hiz breath stinks so hiz breath cimes out in big heavy HUUUUUUU...'s<br>  Lol!|`|W16WgXeMaa	he likes you <br>  so when he gets near you he gets nervous <br>  <br>  how sweet <br>  but puts you in a akward situation|`|ZwJUeYrGaa	I guess he's either shy or nervous around you
Hfp80ylEaa	I have never said the 3 words to anyone besides my parents at a much younger age (and occasionally as a quote or for discussion purposes).  I have had plenty of dating relationships and still have a good relationship with my folks.  The reason I shy away from the popular phrase is one part non-traditionalism and another part sincerity.<br>  <br>  "I love you" is an extremely common phrase to the point that it really becomes just another phase such as referring to each other as boyfriend/girlfriend or a proposal and becoming fiance/fiancee.  I am not saying I believe that people who say it don't mean it but rather that if they would come up with something more personal and unique it could say the same thing but be special for just the two involved.<br>  <br>  For example, the obvious would be coming up with your own alternate phrase, think "Princess Bride" for a classic example.  A different way to send the same message could be in small acts or perhaps a signature act that has some meaning for you/her/both.  <br>  <br>  I believe in thinking outside the box and breaking free of the typical motions most people go through.  It's not better or worse than the way others choose to express themselves it's just who I am.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully that perspective was of some interest to you even if it doesn't really help with your situation much.<br>  <br>  If you know you love him and he loves you then why isn't that enough?  He is clearly expressing it in some way.  Why must he go by the books for it to feel right?|`|1r05fktRaa	when the time right|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	i have known my bf for 4 months  we work together and  we started dating for 2 we talk every day  out of work for about 3 hrs a day  mostly when we drive to work  and when we are off  (we also work diffrent shifts) we know almost everything of eachother  and the other night when i hung up the phone he said it and it was adorable cus i was like well night sweetie  talk to you tomorrow  and he turned i love you like a hundred red m &ms  we have a weird thing with m&ms  i was like oh you do and he was like ya, i love you alot you mean the world to me so   it really  depends you can fall in love fast or slow if you love him then say it  dont hold off till he might think you do not care and he leaves you<br>  dont get mad if he dont say i love you back if you do say it he might love you but is in shock or dont feel that strong toward you  you want him to mean it not say it cus you said it.|`|7VtSu4iGaa	there isnt a set time you say it when you feel it and really mean it.|`|D3ubQMicaa	My fiance and I had been dating for about 5 or 6 months before we first said "I love you" and it was pretty much right before we started talking about getting married. It wasn't that we didn't love each other before then, but neither of us wanted to throw those words around as meaningless. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It is definitely a very personal decision. I know a couple who didn't use the L word until until he proposed. <br>  <br>  It will happen when the time is right (as cliche as that is!) <br>  <br>  I know that a lot of people say by the time you've been dating for 6 months you can know whether or not you would want to marry them... although that is slightly a different topic :)
PBdPD748aa	wow what he is doing is not right at all! children are like sponges, they absorb every little thing that goes on around them, and body language is a huge one. so if this continues, before you know it your son wont have any respect for you as a person, and he will treat you as his father treats you. you do not want that, you need to put an end to it NOW. you need to have a big serious talk with your husband about how he is undermining you and treating you like an idiot. you need to take control, you are the childs mother. you both need to know that your marriage should always come first, he seems to be putting this child on a pedalstool and you below him which is very very unhealthy.|`|mCM363I9aa	he sounds controlling and very stressed. He is taking it out on you, sounds to me that he is mad at something else and you need to get to the bottom of this.<br>  <br>  what a di**|`|2keIEMFUaa	You need to put a stop to this ASAP you need to sit down and i mean sit down and talk to your husband about putting you down in front of your son that you will not put up with it.  What ever you do, do not fight, but Talk to him.  Explain To your husband-the repercussion this will cause your son.  Let him know that you can handle taking your son to bed alone and let him know he can watch from a distant.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	Don't turn from your son because of his father.<br>  Tell hubby it has to stop  or else he has to attend parenting classes with you.<br>  <br>  the jerk!!!|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You have to demand a united front.  Your husband is undermining and alienating you from your child.  He doesn't understand the value of doing things together and correcting your son as a team.  If he continues your relationship with your son and with your husband will be doomed.  Have a stern heart to heart with your husband and demand that you work together as a united front to raise your child and agree on parenting techniques.  If he's unreasonable you have to make it known not only is he damaging things now but also the future whether you're around or not (it's that serious).  Good luck|`|uVwPykXlaa	i think thas very disrespecting on his part wen he undermines yu in front of yo kid.<br>  try to talk to him and if nothing changes ..<br>  take a step back,see  what he expects to be done,and wat yu are doing wrong...<br>  am not saying yu are doing anything wrong..but men are like that,i always fought wit my hubby abt our 1st kid,he wanted to be the mom and dad and only wanted me to change diaper and changing her clothes,(which he chose by the way).i finally had it,and told him his place and to top competing with me....<br>  coz the other thing man gets jealous,wen we have kids,they feel rejected,coz we paying attention to the baby,and instead of laying the issue on the table,they try to turn our kids against us,so they can be the good guys.<br>  dont worry its a phase|`|zu10q3Qyaa	What a jerk your husband is.  He is not respecting you and teaching your child to disrespect you as well.  I'd tell him to either shut up or get out.|`|1hDhmql4aa	I don't know if you husband has unresolved mummy issues or had an upbringing that wasn't healthy in his treatment and respect of the MOTHER but honey, it sounds as though you are with a control freak and an emotional abuser.  When you say that he has changed since you had the child it is because you both have changed roles.  You are now seen as the mother and he is the father.  You are no longer in his mind just married!  If he continues to have the power and abuse it your child will learn from him how to be the man he is and the relationship that he sees you and your husband having will, in his mind become normal.  Your husband is teaching your son that your don't know what you are doing and probably feels safer with his dad.  Also a child will run to the parent who lets them get away with more.  It is not your fault!!!  He is doing things to make sure your son will always run to him.  It is not your innocent child's fault either because he is being trained to run to dad.  He is also taking your confidence away and that is a real big problem because it takes longer to get back than to loose.<br>  You cannot do this on your own!  You will need alot of support so get friends or family behind you and seek counseling.  If he isn't willing to change get the hell out of there.  If you are separated he may still say things to your son behind your back but you will become stronger and have time alone with your son to correct the behavior.
k7Pd7Glqaa	Honey I would love to help you but I can only suggest some resources.  Assuming, you know enough about your mom, such as her full name, age, state she died, and hopefully the exact date she died.<br>  You can go to your local library and look back at old newspaper articles.  I am not sure how old you are, but if you need help doing that, ask the librarian how. <br>  Do you have any family at all who will help you or tell you anything about her?<br>  Do you have any idea of any names of your Mom's friends,  if so, that would be where to start.<br>  As for free,  anything you try to look up on the internet, eventually it will cost money.  ( About other people's background).  You, do not want to ever pay for a report, because they are so mis leading.|`|2aWWZfyVaa	1. you could ask your family<br>  2. google her
D20ue82Iaa	Yes, girls will play hard to get after letting them know they like you.  We're warped like that lol sorry!  The best advice I can give you is to not give up just yet.  Keep asking her out.  If it comes down to it just flat out ask her if she wants to go out with you at all.  If she's worth it, just keep askin her out!|`|1O45sCxZaa	my guess is that she really is too busy to go out just yet. if she really is worth it, keep trying; it will show her that you like her and she'll come around

I just didn't think I was ready to deal with being in a relationship mentally and physically.<br>  <br>  Plus, if she is very flirtatious, she is doing you a favor. You WILL get jealous anyways. Also being ready for the relationship means you aren't flirtatious and can stick to one guy. < -- Reason 1 why she is not ready for a relationship.<br>  <br>  She also is afraid if you break up you can't be friends anymore. Which means she doesn't trust you in some way. <-- Reason 2 she is not ready for a relationship.<br>  <br>  She has guys lined up the door - ( This one I'm guessing )<br>  <- She might be afraid to hurt you when she finds some one better <-- reason 3.<br>  <br>  Or other options :<br>  <br>  She might not like you as you think she does. Maybe she lied.<br>  Maybe her parents don't let her date and she is nervous to tell you that because she thinks you will think she is weird.<br>  Or.. she is just shy or nervous to go out with you.|`|5TIIgqhhaa	hmm thats kinda weird. she seems picky. and leads guys on. thats not a good thing. i think u shood move on and find a new girl cuz u deserve better :)<br>  <br>  please help with mine! :D<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An5uTY7hRmmIN1ZCcE3TKBXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309185250AAuqYEs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|zprAkP3eaa	Maybe she don't like you as much as you think.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Happens all the time.<br>  <br>  Generic friendships build a strong foundation for potential partnerships.  The main thing is to develop a solid sense of mutual encouragement to excel in academic, athletic, and extra curricular achievement.  Appreciate the intellectual value sharing constructive interests without the pressure of immature or premature performance presumptions.<br>  <br>  Friendship can last a lifetime.  Romantic intimacy can be fleeting.  This is an instructive experience.  Social skills evolve with learning to appreciate sensuality of self to respect the senses of friends and peers. <br>  <br>  This is perfectly normal.  She is really doing you a really judicious service.  The pressure you feel is nothing compared to the demands of a mature relationship.  Respect this girl for her intellectual foundation.  Keep her friendship alive.  Learn more about self appreciation.

Just wasting ur fuking time.|`|WtElgJDtaa	maybe her parents wont let her date...?|`|dHqCEcrJaa	OK guy you are in what we grown ups call the "Friend zone"  this happens when she looks at you as a great friend but not with a romantic interest.  More than likely she just does not know how to tell you this with out hurting your feelings.  Don't think to badly of her she is probably just as confused on the subject as you are.  I will say this a women/girl will do what is in her heart even if she does not know why she is doing it.  If you want to get an upgrade from the "friend zone"  you are going to have to show her a new side of you.  Every woman in the world only wants one thing from a man.  And that is for a man to act like a man.  That does not mean to treat her bad but to show her that you are confident (with or with out her) not cocky.  Treat her with respect but don't be at her beck and call.  Make sure that she knows how you feel but don't bring it up all the time.  this will make her feel not pressured and let her make her own decision about how she feels about you.  I hope this is helpful and works out for you.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes <br>  <br>  K|`|K0G9DW0yaa	honestly you should move on cause she is just making up excuses so that she doesn't hurt your feeling...if she really liked you then  she would go out with you..and honestly speaking my bf didnt even ask me out i knew he liked me and i liked him and we hung out so much that we just both knew..and if shes playing with you then you honestly deserve better then her.|`|Keq8vYJLaa	She might not be ready for a boyfriend/ she probably doesn't want one right now.

2P2K0rl2aa	I would say the biggest challenge is children.  If the children get on well together, that's a huge bonus and will save a lot of heartache for everyone concerned.  Another big influence is how the ex-spouses feel about each other and treat each other.  If they harbour grudges and resentment, then there will almost certainly be problems, and it will impact on the blended families.<br>  <br>  In my case, my dad married a woman who had 4 kids.  They were all into drugs, heavy drinking and so on.  They hated me and my brother because they saw us as an 'intrusion' - even though we only visited them once a fortnight.  My parents used to fight about us kids all the time, so life was extremely unpleasant for all concerned.<br>  <br>  but that's just one case - there are a lot of other cases of blended families that have worked very well.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Ex-spouses.

U DONT HAVE TO ANSWER TO HIM ANY MORE..|`|hs793CCxaa	I would want to ask him why he didn't talk to you about it , when the spark was starting to wane. <br>  <br>  Maybe ask to have dinner out somewhere so you can both try to sort it out with a view to  re-lighting the spark. <br>  <br>  If he is not interested at the moment, look at your marriage and see what went wrong and see if you can change things. Do you dress nicely at home, or are you a "sweats" type of person now? Sweats only have one thing going for them & that is comfort - not looks! Weight/fitness? Energetic/ enthusiastic or a bit negative? Just look at your marriage from his point of view, to see why he lost interest, and see if there are changes you can make from your side.<br>  <br>  You could also try the e-book at <a href="http://www.bringbackthespark.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bringbackthespark.com</a> - it's goal is obviously to get the spark back and from what I have seen from the results that friends have had, it seems great. A warm and intimate relationship results from using it. It doesn't cost much, so it has to be worth a try if you love him the way you say you do. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  I have just read the answers here, and many spell out why the divorce rate is the way it is. You don't accept this, if he is the one you love, fight for him!! Don't give up and look for a Lawyer, do things to get him back if that is what you want. Work out a plan and go for it. <br>  <br>  Look yourself in the mirror each morning and tell yourself that you are a capable, smart woman who can do anything you set your mind to. Then go for it! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Be positive - ALWAYS. Best of luck.|`|0AShsMsoaa	read 'relationship rescue' by dr phil mcgraw and 'the proper care and feeding of husbands' by dr laura.  get them immediately.  <br>  <br>  you cant understand any of this? arent you aware of what  is going on around you?  you cant cope?  well, your husband is on a completely different page than  you are and perhaps with another woman as well.  if you do care about your marriage, buy and read those books and wake the heck up and find out what is going on in your own life.  does he have another woman?  <br>  <br>  what do you do?  google marriage counseliing in your town and find the best short term counselor and make an emergency appointment.  tell them what you wrote here and say maybe he has another woman, ( he will deny it if you ask him)  and try to get him to go with you, if not, you go alone.  <br>  <br>  i hate to tell you this, but you  still have a faint  chance to make things right, but, you are going to have to grow up and face this like a grown woman, not like a passive, confused, cant cope victim.    <br>  sorry but that is reality.|`|ugRN86bYaa	He has someone else. I know you don't believe it, but wait and see. There is nothing anyone can say that will take away the pain you're feeling. You just have to take it one day at a time. Lots and lots of people separate and get back together. Think about all the people you know who've done that. Don't ***** at him, cry, or beg him. Be as sweet and pretty as you can be. Don't chase him. He will miss you. Pray, ask God to help you and your family. I will pray for you. God's in the healing business. He can heal your marriage. Lots of people will tell you to file for divorce. If you divorce, the chances of reconciliation lesson significantly. However, I married the same man twice so it's possible. Don't let anyone's opinion influence your decision.|`|AA10886262	you can cope.....now is the time to be MAD not SAD.....get yourself a good lawyer.....half of everything is yours, half his pension, half his 401k, half the savings, half of everything......get the divorce taken care of, child support order in place...then get your butt busy....you will clean that house from top to bottom, every nook and cranny....change it all around, get on the treadmill....lose that 15 lbs you have been meaning to lose, take a class at a local college, make friends....get out there.....<br>  <br>  I am sorry you have to go through this, but you, my dear, are a very strong woman and you can get through this......|`|AA11106650	Sorry to say but for him to just up and leave and not talk to about it, there was someone else in the picture.|`|2keIEMFUaa	You need to get involved in a good church home, and I hate to say this but wants you lose Communication in marriage it's over.  Maybe if you can get to come over and have a nice dinner alone the two and talk about what happen and how can we fix this marriage or even if we can it's some thing both of you have to want to save together.

Instead they could bring a whole pack!  haha  But seriously, that is the truth.<br>  <br>  I'd either pay for the booze myself, or do BYOB, or none at all over a cash bar.  Cash bars are usually WAY over priced.|`|wE5JMeesaa	I've never been to a wedding where guests complained about the drinks served.<br>  <br>  Why don't you make up your signature wedding cocktail and serve that only.  If your guests don't like it, or don't drink, they'll be offered a coke.|`|YldfngvAaa	Saying that people may not like your choice of alcohol is just an excuse not to by it. Sorry, but this isn't a BBQ, its a wedding. So you are going to have people spending money on outfits, gas, babysitters, hotel rooms, shower gifts, wedding gifts and now you are making them pay for their own refreshments? Yikes. That is Tacky with a capital T. Sorry. I assume you know that and just don't care, so this probably won't hurt your feelings anyway. <br>  <br>  Also, there is no difference between cash bar an BYOB. They are equally inconsiderate. <br>  My hall doesn't come with a bartender, cups, or any drinks, that is why I am buying all of that.|`|JtJxVBOsaa	Actually, I think the difference is that your choice isn't tacky like a cash bar. When I get to a reception and find out there's a cash bar, it's like, "surprise! break out your wallet!" You aren't asking people to shell out $5 a beer, they can bring what they want or not drink! I think it's a great idea, very informal and fun.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	What I would do is go to the liquor store and buy all kinds of different bottles and mixers so you have a variety of alcohol. Get 2 kegs one light beer and one regular beer. I'm all about a BYOB party but not at a wedding.  You can get a friend to bartend. Heck, they would probably even make tips.|`|lA6lk50Qaa	We are doing the same thing. If people want to drink alcohol they can bring it, otherwise we will be supplying soft drinks etc. All our guests would rather pay cheaper prices for the same thing and bring it with them. I think the only people who say it's tacky are the ones who can afford to pay for an open bar!<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes|`|okp0CMc3aa	you know, ive been to cash bar weddings and (very informal) byob weddings and i have to say the byob is better, just because it costs the guests alot less & they can drink what they want. i just suggest you supply the mix and table wine(for a toast).|`|ddXDh7rCaa	If your family is cool with it, go for it.  Most places don't allow you to bring your own booze so this is perfect for people that drink spirits and usually have to pay for them at a cash bar anyway.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the wedding.|`|XTmiI44laa	Go with the bar, those who want to drink can.|`|TJKvoLeBaa	Pick a few different beverages and that is what will be served.  You do not have to cater to each induvidual person, but a cash bar is rude and not cool at all, no matter how hillbilly you might be.  I have been to a ton of weddings and never once have I seen a cash bar for the reception.  Yes, there was a cash bar after the 4 hours of free bar...but those people were the people that were just getting drunk that were still drinking and they should pay.  But the guests that are there for the celebration of your wedding should not have to pay for their drinks.|`|4POGapREaa	Because it IS tacky.  And then there's the issue of putting your guests out of their way to stop somewhere & get all this crap.  And what if Uncle Billy Bob gets a huge bottle of Jack Daniels because he thinks he's obligated to do so & then has one shot?  How is that saving him any money?  Plus, you created mass confusion with 200 people all trying to call each other to see who's bringing what, yada yada yada.  So obviously people do feel obligated otherwise they would just bring exactly 3 Coronas and limit themselves to that.  Obviously nobody's going to take their 1/2 leftover bottle home because THAT would then seem tacky on THEIR part so it's more like you're using your guests to supply the alcohol & leave loads of it behind for you too.  I find it very hard to believe that not ONE out of 200 people didn't call you on that or at least ask "are you serious"?|`|wMWfCjBpaa	You know your guests and how you want your wedding. From the info you provided it sounds like BYOB is the way to go. Drinks are expensive at a cash bar. Most of whom are getting married have to remember that college wasn't that long ago so BYOB is not a new thing. Do as you please and have a blast. Alcohol doesn't determine if your reception was horrible.
2JUQYLCGaa	Well here's what not do to:<br>  DON'T push it so far into the mouth that you reach the tonsils.<br>  Also, if you feel the other person's head withdrawing a little then you need to relax on the pressure.<br>  <br>  DON'T wiggle it back and forth.<br>  I made out with a guy that did that and it was disgusting.<br>  <br>  DON'T let it cover your lips.<br>  Another guy stuck his tongue out and held it over his bottom lip while he was kissing me, I was like what the FF??? Are you serious??<br>  <br>  MAKE SURE YOU CLOSE YOUR MOUTH every now and then.<br>  If you don't know what I mean, watch most teen romance movies and when they kiss it shows that they open and close their mouths over and over again.<br>  <br>  I made out with one guy that just left his mouth open and let his tongue go in circles forever and it was ******* boring and gross. All his spit was like ... seeping into my mouth and I eventually just pushed him off because I was grossed out. Then I dumped him.|`|J8lfBZaxaa	Okay.  BIG misconception: You Do Not Use the Tip of Your Tongue.  Period.  Never, ever.  The sensual part of the kiss is when the centers of your two tongues touch; when your tongues are entwined in either of your mouths.  When you go to kiss her, start with your lips slightly parted.  Like you're saying, "Oh."  Start out with your head slightly ******, and kiss her gently.  Just softly, just slightly.  You want her to have just a taste before you try and kiss her deeply.  If you start with a soft kiss she'll be much more likely to be receptive to a deeper one.  Kiss her gently for a little bit.  Don't do it robotically.  It will start to feel natural after the first couple of touches.  When YOU FEEL READY, ease your tongue into her mouth.  Her lips should be slightly parted by now, so it should be fairly easy to do.  You will probably feel this overwhelming urge to pull it back out.  DON'T.  It's okay.  She would not have let your tongue into her mouth if she was totally against it.  Now, the kiss will take care of itself.  Have fun, take a deep breath, and relax.  It will come naturally :)  Good luck!|`|ejrxNVD1aa	press your lips against another persons lips|`|Z93I52jMaa	well.<br>  you just start of like with several pecks.<br>  then open mouth kiss. no tongue.<br>  kiss the bottom lip for a bit.<br>  then nudge thetonguee against the other persons lips<br>  if they let you in lol then just kinda explore intheirr mouth with yourtonguee.<br>  touch theeretonguee. <br>  then end it with a few pecks.<br>  TAA DAA!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309191209AAOHIeu&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|cW0wAV1caa	trust me... my first making out session i didnt know what the hell i was doing, but i followed my partners lead and went with the flow...do the same... and you wont even notice if your messing up|`|tzQ9m52aaa	Don't gag her or lick her teeth.<br>  Go with what feels right.|`|4IHe4rPYaa	move ur toungue a lot and be passionate<br>  =]|`|g6p6PXfvaa	You can sort of kiss/lick her neck, most girls like that.  You can lick her vagina, we also like that!  But really, just kiss her softly with your lips and be kind of slow and soft with the tongue.  Learn how girls like to be touched, probably similar to what feels good to you.  Grab her butt and kind of rub with medium pressure from the inside of the bottom of her a$$ to the inside of the back of her thigh, that's good too, but look out, she'll probably wanna get it on after you put these moves on her!|`|1ZEYIsPAaa	It has been so long since I thought about this. It will come naturally after a few times. Just move your tounge in a figure 8 & keep it loose so she can move hers too. Don't stick your tounge down her throat. Also lightly bite her bottom lip or suck on it. If you feel stupid just kiss her neck & she will LOVE that. Good luck!|`|9mMTQQBfaa	Just run it underneath their tongue. Don't just stick it in there and move it around because it's not cute, it's just sloppy and make sure you don't shove it down their throat.|`|ktjw6JX0aa	Save it for marriage because it's not all it cracked up to be and even after marriage you will be trying to not give it away:)|`|UGSlEhnbaa	that is disgusting!

And don't be nervous. And breath through your nose. Haha. Good luck!|`|qu3IFl4baa	move it around in the other persons mouth:not all crazy but just to show that its  there and play with the other persons tounge with yours.|`|vX5Cw1Xiaa	the key is to feel, not think (as corny as that sounds).

l9xnybUMaa	there is a great DVD  called "FireFighter about a brave guy with a similar situation; he feels his wife is not showing him respect and he is not getting any, affection.  He finds an interesting solution.<br>  Rent it and see what you think.  Hope this helps
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Quit asking him if he likes you...if he does, a relationship will just develop...don't be so pushy...|`|FiCl71flaa	Since you said that each time you ask him if he  likes you ,he ignores you.I would suggest that you ignore him too and move on with your life.Even if he does not like you all he has to do is tell you in a nice way.When a guy or a gal stops been courteous and respectful,they are not good boyfriend or girlfriend material. If you truly like him , you can try to talk to him at a private time and place..His responses will let you know how he feels and also what your next move should be. I wish you all the best .|`|QkkKs9Veaa	Or maybe you should ask him if he like you. <br>  Ask him like this ' Hey , umm i like you but i dont know if you like me or not. i was just wondering. DO you ?" if he say no then forget about him cause he not worth to get with you. find a better man .|`|cW0wAV1caa	sorry babes...but if he is ignoring your when you ask him, then its prolly clear that he doesnt feel the same way...screw him!!! move on...he clearly doesnt deserve your time,....start ignoring him... and maybe he will see how it feels and finally answer you...|`|vWsP9uznaa	maybe he is shy, and nervous, and he doesnt know if he likes u aor nott, give it time. see how it works.|`|qXkTatLMaa	Here's the thing.  You would get more attention if you ignore him.... strange, but true. Leave him alone, and he will pay attention.|`|uvAzxEFUaa	I think...you should move on. I know it's really hard to hear but I've learned from past experiences that it only will get harder if you don't get over it. If he did like you he would have expressed it by now. Guys are confusing. Usually when they tease you it means they like you but if he's ignoring you, he probably doesn't have those feelings for you. Guys avoid questions they're not comfortable with most of the time. And you shouldn't be using all this effort to try to get him. He obviously isn't worth it if he's not responding. You also shouldn't have to go looking for a guy, he should be trying to get YOU. :]|`|UGSlEhnbaa	If you ask him too many times, he's just going to get frustrated and not like you at all. I would stop obsessing over him. Let him come on his own free will. Guys like their space so its better not to overstep your boundaries. If you make him jealous that may work to get him to act faster, but theres no guarantees.|`|xsLnqDinaa	Stop being pushy and clingy!<br>  face it, guys don't like pushy girls!<br>  If he hasn't`t given you a sign or spilled the words"i like you too" outta his mouth that should tell you something!<br>  <br>  -dannie|`|fI2uesEwaa	Yeah, if anything you're either annoying him, or freaking him out by asking him so many times. Why don't you try to build a friendship with him, and maybe, he will open up to you more.|`|oySX5VRfaa	He's probably just shy because of the fact that you are really, really really really ridiculously good looking. I dont know,? what if u ask him when he's really, really, really drunk?|`|bQTFX54waa	if he is ignoring you<br>  then forget hiand find someone else<br>  or else how do you know he won't ignore you<br>  if you guys get in a relationship|`|ktjw6JX0aa	First you don't ask a guy if he likes you.. so what if he doesn't. Act like you don't care and he will be all up in your face.|`|ofGv9uIAaa	well if you guys flirt with each other then he prolly does like you hes just to shy to tell you.<br>  <br>  but if you guys have nothing going on<br>  then he just doesnt wanna hurt your feelings.|`|TEhhtS3Raa	hey hunny... well to me it seems like the shy approach is not getting you no where your next step is to be up front tell him you really been trying to know if he feels the same way and it has been making you a little puzzled because you just don't want to be trying to spend time with one person who is sending mixed signals and is not  even interested... and try ask when there are no distractions so you can have his full attention. Even if it is not what you want to hear at least you know how he feels and won't be going crazy trying to figure out how he feels about you and you trying to spend all your time with someone that does not feel the same way. Good luck|`|jcxAk4F8aa	well he's probably ignoring you because you keep asking him if he likes you<br>  at this point, he probably doesn't, and it will keep getting worse if you keep asking him<br>  so stop asking, and just be a chill friend<br>  that's hotter than anything<br>  he probably thinks you sound desperate and pushy, so don't go there<br>  and if he just doesn't like you, then forget him<br>  there are plenty of other guys out there that are better suited for you<br>  *i'm sorry if this sounds mean but i'm just telling it like it is|`|Wc96SRkpaa	oh i've been though this before! i know how you feel, girl.<br>  <br>  its always helpful to get a friend to investigate for you, but be aware that there can be some misunderstanding with that.<br>  <br>  lots of guys are shy. not all, but many. especially when it comes to girls and relationships. they fear rejection! <br>  <br>  maybe you could get to know him better as a friend if you two arn't close yet. that way he may feel more comfortable around you!|`|xBq8cGzKaa	well if i were you i would just tell him.  he might just be shy to say that he likes you.  If he doesn't then what is going to happen... nothing.  just tell him and hope for the best.  good luck and relax.|`|AA11303023	Ignore him...they always come when you act like you dont give a darn...trust|`|1a8e5c5055a23f24cdc079440ec71d64aa	guys prefer girls who aren't all over them, they wont something they cant have. so basically back off a bit and maybe he will come around. good luck!!|`|jYK9uFuzaa	First of all, how old are you?|`|YQYZR7I0aa	stay away from him. that will bring him to you. ignore him back.
2JUQYLCGaa	Ummm.<br>  When a guy says he "REALLY likes" his new girlfriend ...<br>  especially to his ex (you),<br>  <br>  To be blunt,<br>  he's telling you that he's happy with his new girl and doesn't want you any more.<br>  <br>  Don't let the thought "he's such a swinger" give you any glimmer of hope because girls waste their time with the tiniest evidence of anything that leans in the direction they want it to. Oh and don't let the one happy answer in every ten sad answers on yahoo make you think it's worth it either.<br>  <br>  Besides, if he's such a swinger, then why is he worth it?<br>  <br>  Also, flirting with him while he has an ex might just make you look desperate to him. Most guys would look down on you and lose respect for you.<br>  <br>  Get over him.<br>  You should have known that as soon as he started dating someone new.<br>  <br>  Don't make someone a priority in your life when you're not even an option in theirs.|`|jcxAk4F8aa	don't turn on the flirting mode full blast<br>  then you would be stealing your ex away from his gf, and from personal experience, that hurts a lot, and takes a while to get over<br>  besides, in retrospect, he would probably like you less and have less respect for you if you did that<br>  because it's a really mean thing to do<br>  if he decides to like you still, and you still like him, then he'll break up with his gf and go for you<br>  but you have to respect the fact that you guys already had your chance, and broke up<br>  if you guys are meant to be, then it'll happen<br>  just don't try and force it|`|Q1Qk3LDWaa	yes yes i do(: have some fun even if he doesnt|`|nfRoYBwwaa	Oh you don't want to do that. Now I might suggest that only to the two people if they truly love each other.But he might really like his girlfriend. It's only respectful to let this go and do not but in on their relationship. No if he does break up with that girlfriend...then wait a week then make a move on him.:)<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|m0xehTLqaa	ya you do!! go for it! steal him back!|`|DsNEpN95aa	hells yea, I mean if he's a swinger, anything can happen. If you fix the problem/reason that caused you guys to break up in the relationship, it will help you strengthen this one! <br>  <br>  And besides, anything can happen. But don't waste time on a guys who's not worth it though.|`|X4i2jej5aa	Maybe, but I think that since he has a girlfriend, you shouldn't try to ruin their relationship for your own benefit.

hs793CCxaa	Plan something to look forward to - it will be good for you both. <br>  <br>  They say a happy life requires:<br>  Someone to love<br>  Something to do<br>  Something to look forward to....<br>  <br>  He has you, but are you exciting to be with? I say this seriously and with good intent. Often in a marriage things slip and it becomes mundane. Make that "someone to love", an exciting someone! <br>  <br>  Does he have a job? If so, are there problems? Can you help? If he is out of work, support him, try to boost his confidence etc. Help him find a job if possible or start a business??<br>  <br>  Something to look forward to - a holiday, a weekend away, a night away....If you can't afford these, then put some money away each week and plan it for xxx weeks time. He can look forward to it meanwhile.  Budget is just too tight to do anything? Try to change things for the better, but meanwhile, you could try some no cost things like - a night fishing or doing a favorite activity, lying on a rug looking at the stars, going camping, dipping his p enis in a favorite topping and licking it off - he could dribble some on your good bits and lick it off. Use your imagination to create some fun. <br>  <br>  Try the e-book at <a href="http://www.bringbackthespark.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bringbackthespark.com</a> - it has lots of great suggestions on ways to spark up your relationship - things you can do on a daily, every second day....or weekly basis. It doesn't cost much and it has made several couple friends relationship spark up again into loving, warm (hot) relationships. <br>  <br>  He must know you are there for him. Good luck.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	Get him to the doctor right away.  They can probably give him medication to level out an imbalance of chemicals in his brain.  Depression is usually fixable, but serious.

The best thing you can do is be supportive and try to get him to go to counseling.|`|Sj9Q4bt4aa	I think you should encourage him to seek help. It sounds like his is pretty much withdrawing from life all together. I feel bad for him. I have never felt that way exactly but I know where he is coming from. It probably isn't you. It is probably just something he has been going through. Sometimes it's just life. Not any ONE incident. Just stay strong for him and be supportive.

AA11329387	This is the adult world. Be an adult and confront him in person in an adult manner. Rumors are just that. Explain everything to him rationally. That is all you can do.

I think you should go up to him and ask him what he has heard. also who has said that and then tell him that it isn't true. If he doesn't believe you then you need to move on. You don't need to like someone like that. That just means he believes rumors over the actual person. You need someone better than that. But really go up t him and ask him.

You should develop a good relationship with your parents. The more accepting you are of there values (out of respect). The more mature you actually are.

I feel that right now, things that seem like gestures are taken for granted and hence expected in marriage. hence, this would put responsibility of full filling your spouse's expectations. if any of you fail to meet it, the relationship though slowly but will start to strain.while you may think that this can happen at any age, in my view,right now both of you are one of the most crucial stages of career development. thus, concentrating on it now will earn you a bright future. i think that having a stable career before you tie the knot will not only reassure your families but also each other. it will lay the foundation for a strong family as we need to be practical and hence remember that financial security is one of the most important bases for a stable family.|`|4POGapREaa	Maybe it will, maybe it won't.  Maybe you're overstating your level of maturity to get positive answers.  Maybe you do know what you're doing.

Infection could cost you your life, and disfigurement or other complications are common.
R7b150Iyaa	Absolutely!  I think it comes down to the fact that when you are planning a wedding, you have to rely (even slightly) on certain people, and that's when you find out that a lot of people don't care or aren't truly there for you.  It's fine for them to be friends with you when you're just meeting up for drinks, but it's an entirely different ballgame when you are asking them to be there for you on the biggest and most important day of your life.<br>  <br>  I've also noticed that a lot of women (usually either single or divorced women) have issues with weddings, period.  So it's not necessarily about you, more about their own issues.  For example, my aunt was married for 20 years and got divorced about 4 years ago.  She is our only family here in the US and my dad's sister, so pretty close family.  Throughout the entire year of our planning, the only thing she asked me in relation to our wedding was "is it open bar?"  I swear, how ridiculous is that?<br>  Even on the wedding day, she didn't compliment me or the groom and I don't even think she said congratulations.  And she insists on writing our cards in Russian when she knows that my husband doesn't speak it (she does speak English so there's no excuse).<br>  <br>  I've also had drama in my wedding planning: a bridesmaid dropped out two months before to pursue acting in California (I kid you not) and maid of honor drama because she didn't contribute to planning the bridal shower, everything fell on another bridesmaid (who did an amazing job by the way), and the maid of honor never even gave her the money for it!!! Not only that, but she generally didn't help me with anything and her toast at the wedding sucked, even though she pegs herself to be a writer.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is a novel...LOL.  Bottom line is:  I don't think it's you who changed, I think you are seeing people's true characters (that tend to come out when you need them for something, even if it's just to be there for you emotionally) and lack of caring.  I don't think that they changed, I think that they have been like this all along but you just haven't seen it thus far until you are planning the most special day of your life.<br>  <br>  In the end though, it is all worth it.  I just got married 3 weeks ago, and all of my wedding stress disappeared when I saw my hubby waiting for me at the end of the aisle...it was magical.  <br>  <br>  I wish you a beautiful wedding day, free of drama and full of happiness!!!|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	I think the worse does come out. I do alot on my own. I rarely ask for help, and when I do I really need it. I advised my bridesmaids that the only think I'll be strict on are tattoos. Please refrain from them until after July 11. <br>  <br>  What's happened.<br>  <br>  They've acquired 2 tattoss on the back, the food, the back of the ankle, the wrists, and on the fingers.|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	Yes. and Yes. <br>  <br>  The wedding curmudgeon speaks out again!<br>  <br>  I hate big weddings for just this thing. Way, way too many people get all bent out of shape for stupid things like gym memberships and bouquets. It's pitiful. In truth, I would rather hire actors to portray friends and relatives. At least they would put on the correct behavior.<br>  <br>  But do look at yourself, dear. Make sure you are not contributing to this fracas because you're the bride and it's your day. Sometimes brides get really carried away over a certain shade of peach or the length of the flower petals. So just make sure YOU are not contributing to these stupid little fires.<br>  <br>  And when it's all over, be the generous one and allow these silly people to come back into your lives with all the trimmings and joy of the return of a lost puppy. Say nothing about the incident that caused the rift and be gracious and happy to have your friends back.|`|AA11708021	Oh heck yes!<br>  <br>  A good friend of the family stopped speaking because she said I should have given her the money to cook our wedding food as opposed to hiring a cater.<br>  <br>  My mom (who made the girl's dresses) threw a hissy fit at the MOH because she's too heavy to fit the dress.<br>  <br>  My FMIL wants to "give away" her son right BEFORE I walk down the aisle and copped a 'tude when I objected.<br>  <br>  My FBIL is upset because of a variety of things (who knows?) and pulled out of the wedding.<br>  <br>  The MOH said I worded the outside of her invitation wrong.  <br>  <br>  Everyone had something to say!  Sorry you have to go thru it too...i think many brides do.|`|JX7QG3IEaa	Oh heck yes! I always suggest etiquettehell.com for these questions - tons of tacky/emotional stories about bad wedding behavior!<br>  <br>  Flaked on you because of a gym membership? That is nuts!<br>  <br>  A ten year best friendship ended with my wedding... basically my attached at the hip best friend (who I had always thought would be my MOH) stopped speaking to when I told her I was engaged. She said "oh," and didn't bother to call, send a card, show up, or essentially give a rat's butt!|`|IjSVNOZraa	Are you sure it's them and not you who has changed?<br>  <br>  I don't mean this meanly. Weddings can just bring out the worst in people, and the bride and groom are no exception. If you notice that it seems to be *everyone else* exhibiting weird behavior... well, I'd take a look in the mirror and see *why* they all seem to be acting weird.|`|cCymTwdcaa	I think it's a combination of the two. I have been calm and cool throughout the whole thing, though I was mad when my mom and MOH (sister) used my invitation making supplies for crafts, and then laughed in my face about it. <br>  We also aren't having an extravagant, uber-traditional wedding, so it's about us and our love, and as such makes me too happy to have bizarre behavior or bridezillaness come.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	True character. I ended a friendship after being a bridesmaid in her wedding. I realized. . .finally. . .that she was selfish and the friendship had always been one sided. It took the wedding to finally make me see the light of not wanting this kind of person in my life.|`|cQMWB6S0aa	I think it brings out both worst behavior and true character especially if there is booze involved.|`|ozXXaaGoaa	of course|`|0hV7pTfXaa	i think people get really overwhelmed with weddings and honestly im not sure why. I guess being a military wife I have just learned to deal with things rationally. My husband was scheduled to deploy 2 months after our wedding so when we began preparation I just had to tell everyone we love and appreciate them but this was about us and OUR time together before he left for a year. We didn't want it to get out of hand. So i believe if you let people know where you stand right away and really mean it they'll get it. Needless to say our wedding was perfect to us and I was never stressed out.|`|aWCMK4Agaa	Yes. We are having an identical issue with my fiance's best man... however we know why he's backing out. Because my fiance's exwife and his best man's wife are still best friends.... and the best man's wife doesn't like me. She not only doesn't like me, but it upset that I haven't asked for her help with the wedding.... WELL DUH! So she's asked him to not be in the wedding. <br>  <br>  That being said... that's the ONLY problem with people we've had... we've actually had quite the opposite experience, where our wedding is bringing a whole lot of great qualities out of our family members and friends. It's been truly blissful with the exception of the best man situation. <br>  <br>  I think that the stress of weddings can definitely show a person's true character... well stress in general, not just with weddings. Weddings bring people together, and put stress into relationships that may not have been through stressful times before. These people may act like this in general with stress, but this could be the first time you are having first hand contact with it.<br>  <br>  It's YOUR wedding... worry about yourself and your future hubby... not the selfishness of others. This is not their day and it is not about them.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best. I'll pray for ya!|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	yes! I think people get really stressed out by weddings, feelings are easily hurt. Its like how when it rains, no one can drive. When someone gets married, people forget their manners!|`|AA11380378	Luckily, everyone in my wedding was very helpful and did not give me any headaches. <br>  <br>  It may have to be with the fact that I did not "demand" anything from anyone, including the wedding party, whose only duty was to show up and have a good time. <br>  <br>  I was considerate of people's pocket books. I understand that not everyone has thousands of spare dollars stashed under the mattress at their disposal to spend on "my day".<br>  <br>  I was considerate of people's feelings and even the must absurd and wacky "advice" or "suggestion" was taking with respect and gratitude. I never implied that my taste was better than anyone else's. I did not care about the diference in between off-white and eggshell.<br>  <br>  I never treated anyone like an employee or a slave. I never told anyone what to do or where to stand and what they "should" do' I never demanded parties, showers or bacheloretes.<br>  <br>  People will not tell you to your face, they will simply walk away if your expectations are too high or if they cannot afford your demands or if you do not want to talk about nothing else.<br>  <br>  Being considerate goes along way. I did not offend anyone on my wedding and likewise, I did not felt offended by anyone either.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  EDIT TO ADD: Well, if is not that, I supposed it could be the economy. People really cannot afford the "honor" to be in the wedding party or attend a wedding anymore. People are afraid to spend money driving, gifting and then just get served an appetizer and spend a pretty penny on the cash bar, money dance etc. The economy and past wedding hosts may have scared away your people. I know that I have been used so many times as a guest that was only good for a gifts and I can honetsly say that I'm worn out with cheap, inconsiderate, rude brides. I rather spend my money elsewhere. I'm sure many feel the same way as getting married during economic slow down has not been very good for recent brides. Good luck
9yj86j0Caa	You're caught in a lousy situation.  Is there a family member you can go live with?  Uncle, aunt, older sibbling?  Grandparents?  If not, try and keep to yourself and make the best of it until you are old enough to get out and be on your own.  Try to immerse yourself in your studies as much as possible.  You might also try talking with a school counselor or the parent of one of your friends.  Don't let your studies go.  An education will be your ticket out of this sick environment.  Do all you can to advance yourself in school.  And, as hard as it might be, try and be as polite and agreeable around the house, even if it means gritting your teeth.  Just pretend you are an actor in a play.  Don't get between them and their sick relationship.  Stay as far out of it as you can and keep your chin up.  2 more years and you can get out on your own.  Good luck to you.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	well, good luck, i hope you feel better now that you've vented.|`|VN3WlVL0aa	It's okay. I know sometimes people need to vent and let out their feelings.<br>  <br>  I feel your pain. Although I have never experienced something like you have, I understand how hard it is to be in that situation (my friend was, and still is, in one herself). It really takes a toll on you and can stress you and and break your heart.<br>  <br>  From what I've read, talking to both of them about how you feel is out of the question. I suggest you talk to another adult that you trust (teacher, counselor, neighbor, etc). Let them know how you are feeling. If you ask them to get the police involved, they will. Vent to them. Don't give up. Do not pretend like things are not happening. That makes things worse.<br>  <br>  Your parents (both your father and your mother) must be going through some sort of emotional and/or mental turmoil, and they are taking it out on you. I understand how that is. My parents do it sometimes, and it hurts. I do not know how to help you on that subject, except that you should try to be forgiving. Your parents might not mean anything they say about you negatively; it may just be a spur-of-the-moment thing. <br>  <br>  If you need to talk, I'm here at: doomwyte@yahoo.com. I'm almost 15 so I'm a teenager too, and I know how it feels. <br>  <br>  ?Doomwyte?|`|eSGBXFEjaa	Wow that is wrong! I am glad you are venting because you really need to tell people this!

If they say fine, ask what they have been up to. If they state something they did, talk about that thing they did. After they do that, listen to the description of what they did and ask another question about something they stated. The easiest way to do a general conversation is to always LISTEN to what they say and then ask another question or answer their question based on what they just previously stated.|`|AA12240608	i would at least start6 smiling or laugghat him when he does somethingg cute.u could also talk to himabout stuff he likes.|`|c2cb45736c5eded6aac648301090309eaa	jsut be yourself and find your group of friends fet in an activity at school that u like so u have something in common|`|cc4d061ca1928a2f124df60139a32c41aa	if you want to get his attention look at him if he's looking at you and go up to him and put his head under your boobs|`|1c404514c2f9b738a2e58879a1ebe895aa	Well i usally act like im not intrested in any guy and then they just seem to like me more!!|`|5b254355bde85d2213db2f5063d155e6aa	it really just depends on the guy!! just for friends, try some of the stuff they like and see if they will talk to you!!  as for hot guys, do the normal stuff!" hard to get "is your best friend!!|`|5fb76d00ad70286ad31f9f962e9c9641aa	I have a lot of experience!

See, if you become "just friends" then you will stay friends and not really get to know each other better ;).  But, if you don't talk to a guy and stuff then he's not going to know you and not want to go out with you.  BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!  Some guy friends will want to become more than friends so make it clear to them that you only want to be friends... Also, be careful how you turn somebody down.  If you turn down one of your guy friends and he's friends with your crush and you turn him down wrong then he could tell your crush that you're kinda mean and you don't want that....

b70726a65f169615c729e80eae13716aaa	Hello:<br>  <br>  First off don't worry too much about the first kiss or the first boyfriend. My first "real" kiss (if you don't count the kissing of boys in like preschool), was during a game of truth or dare to a guy that I didn't like at all. I was 13 years old. I have always regretted that I don't have this great memory of a first kiss, because after all you only get a first kiss once.<br>  <br>  Is there a guy you like? Don't pick a guy to be your boyfriend just because you want a boyfriend and a first kiss. I know when I was that age everyone was getting boyfriends and breaking up with them, and I didn't even like half the guys that were my "boyfriend" but I just wanted to have a boyfriend. <br>  <br>  My suggestion is to just let it happen naturally, because it will happen. Maybe try to be a little more outgoing, start talking to that cute guy that sits near you in class, or start saying hello to more guys in the hallway. Little steps like that will help other people start to chat with you, and eventually you'll have more guy friends than you know what to do with.<br>  <br>  As for the holiday's deadline, I wouldn't worry about it too much. It will happen, maybe not by Christmas time, but when it does happen you'll be happy. You won't want to miss out on a great relationship.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and good luck.|`|AA10781904	I didnt have my first "romantic" kiss until I was 15! Dont push it, It will come with time, I know thats probably all you are thinking about right now, but if you obsess about it, when it does happen, it wont be what you expected. Plus, what you dont think about happening, will eventually happen.|`|dc6ffc79010134fa610210a9ccaf2d10aa	hi.<br>  <br>  I think that you have to try be yourself around boys. they will like you, don't be shy!
f63937af92c89ef0157cec794438d0a0aa	Try hanging out with some friends that have a lot of guy friends, or find a way to attend coed parties where there will be many guys. You can just start hanging out in groups of guys and girls and eventually there will be a guy that you take a liking to and who likes you back... also there'll be some guy who you can be friends with. Good luck.|`|dc7c7738aae8ff51c390cae30e9edaecaa	Oh. My. Gosh. Same here, dudette. 15, no kiss, no boyfriend, and I'm trying to get the guy I like before the holidays too. I'm not totally sure how to do it, cuz I'm shy too. I can only talk to him when he's not with his friends and I'm not with my friends. Sorry about that, but it's nice to know I can identify with someone, even though it is kinda pathetic. Good luck dudette =)..
130dba6dd4565d3d900d63269b7ab29baa	Turn on some music and move your body to it. Dont worry too much, Im sure you arent the ONLY one there who hasnt danced before, but once everyone really gets into it, People really dont pay all that close of attention to it. If you are really nervous, Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart, and move your hips in a figure 8 from side to side. Dont sway, and as far as your arms go, I think its so sexy when dancing and the song refers to a "YOU" if you point at people. I go out dancing every other weekend and have alot of fun. My friends say Im a great dancer and Im always having a blast... so I hope this helps some.|`|AA10637845	To slow dance:<br>  Stand a few inches apart, depending on how comfortable you are with him.  He will put his hands on your waist, or on the small of your back.  You put your hands on his shoulders.  It's cute if you have your hands around his neck, both hands touching each other behind him.  Then you just sort of...move.  It's not like dancing to a fun, fast song, but like a sway...  You can talk to him some if you want, or you can just look behind his shoulder.

Keep scrunching w/your hands on & off until your hair is dry (it's OK to flip back over after the initial scrunch). It'll most likely come out at least a little wavy. Do your best not to tease it too bad, you might come out looking frizzy. John Freda's "secret weapon" hair syrum is a good way to keep the frizz down.<br>  <br>  You could also go to a stylist and ask her to give you something modern....tell them your hair is too plain and you want to shake it up. They could probably give you a cool layered-do.<br>  <br>  If you don't want a cut, try parting on the side and sweeping the bigger side into a tiny claw-clip or bobby-pin on the front/side of your head. I got this little "do" from Rachel on Friends when she was wearing her long/straight do in the later seasons. I wear it all the time...even right now!! You can also use this look when you're wearing the wavy-do, as sometimes it doesn't look right all the way down (this is my do today).|`|3267de577174fe8977d2fd73845cc91faa	I think women hair style is the best after making love.<br>  Just use the hair holder to preserve it.|`|7b03a26dc21c706ea068ecdc492222dbaa	I think women hair style is the best after making love.<br>  Just use the hair holder to preserve it.|`|AA11552835	have you tried ponyails or letting it go long.....I LOVE girls with long hair...is that you??

Bipolar is waaay beyond being up one day and down the next...<br>  <br>  OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.<br>  <br>  It is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_dia...</a> ). The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.<br>  <br>  The cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.<br>  <br>  There are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.|`|17a996b989e34f368d4077d575f7d39faa	Hey, dont' judge her....if she wants you to be in her business she would have told you....maybe it's you thats getting on her nerves? but to answer your question, if she were bi-polar you could tell by the rapid ups and downs, mood swings or like she's a firecracker with no fuse....either way, why don't you ask her instead of talking to her boyfriend and her other friends....how would you like it if you were having a few off days and someone went behind your back and was talking to people about you like you were crazy?|`|635c42dbbba46bbdb05daecb6114d864aa	Well, as I have depression, I can probably tell you the symptoms [if that's what you want to call them] of depression.

But have you ever heard the saying of loving someone for the very same reasons of why you hate them.

She may be attracted to jerks as you call them because in alot of ways her own father could have been a jerk. It's really complicated, and sometimes borderline bizarre, But women also think they can change men but forget that if they change them then the very reason of why they love them changes too.

One way I expressed my affection for a guy was to place an ad in a special valentine insert in the local paper....I used a catchy poem (that someone else had written in my school year book years ago) and used a code for our names.  He didn't actually recognize the ad when it appeared....but before leaving my house for a date the same night the paper had came out I handed him a copy of the paper and asked him if he noticed anything written for him.  He smiled and said he usually reads those ads.....and got a laugh when I pointed out the one I'd written for him.  He saved the ad and I noticed it later pinned to a bulletin board in his office.  Maybe not the most clever way to express affection....but we'd only been dating a short while.  You may want to be more private though.  Good Luck|`|ca3305883049e51766a1c14f8c8e7ee9aa	well... if he has ever told you something that he's always wanted but never got, you should get it...like... if he said that he has never had a surprise birthday party... or he wanted this "toy" for like ever when he was young but never got one... then get it.. it will say a lot about how you feel and care about him.
5ea76b6e02f899948b8c43de9828fd9faa	most people are accustomed to dating within their race, not that that is necessarily a better choice, but with a lot of ppl, a person of similar ethnic background will be considered first.  they might think that you'd prefer black men...especially since "once you go black, u never go back"|`|a9e59e3bb292f0e26705d7fd4ca65651aa	Probably because most interracial relationships include black men and white women...

af39faf8e4f91580bb369ea30d7b1daeaa	First of all, I don't think you need to see a psychologist.<br>  <br>  To other people you may seem very insecure, jeolous or whatever but I think it is just your personality.  Some people find it harder than others to handle certain situations and this is obviously due to you being cheated on before.  I definetly don't think you are going crazy or anything, you just have really strong feelings for a girl and it's great that you actually have someone to care about that much.<br>  <br>  If you feel like you need some guidance or even just someone to talk to, you could go and see a counsillor or find a close friend to talk to.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, you are currently in a long distance relationship and if she is gonna cheat, she'll do it and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.  That is not your problem, it will be on her conscience.  <br>  <br>  I think you need to find something else to keep your mind busy and try not to think about her too much (I know it's hard).  If and when she does come back, if you guys decide to continue the relationship that's great but incase she doesn't want that anymore, maybe you should try to have fun and go out with friends while your apart too.|`|0e5dc68f5b9b0eaac181efb81ef286efaa	Sorry but i can see why girls cheat on you. You always asking, where were you? who were you with? can get annoying and some girls instead of just breaking up cheat. (which i see as wrong)<br>  Being paranoid is not sexy girls like confedence. step up be a man and stop being a whiny pussie.|`|AA10146727	you just seem to have bad luck at picking gfs.  you're good a picking ones that will cheat.  just try to pick one that seems like she won't cheat on you.|`|a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	no you dont need to see a psychologist, you have hopefully told her that youve been cheated on before so she understands where your comein from, make plans to go see her and stuff, its kinda natural to be a lil paranoid about such a thing even without havein it happen to you before, but besure she knows about that|`|aff86e2d7cd7e17e77f81e8dcfb0d12baa	trust her and no u dont need to go see one

AA10939048	This practice is very common in India. Everything is arranged including a period of courtship to check out if the couple is compatible. The matches are arranged through matrimonial websites, or through friends or newspaper advertisements. When all the required information of the boy or girl namely their family, financial and career backgrounds in particular seem to be agreeable meetings are arranged between the families. Before this photos are also exchanged and if need be detective agencies are employed for vital clues as to the character of the boy or girl.<br>  This has proved in practice to be fairly successful. Also because a lot of community effort has gone into arranging the marriages they tend to be successful.<br>  Divorces mostly tend to be rare and if at all on genuine grounds of incompatibility after all other efforts (and factors are taken into account) at patching up are exhausted.<br>  This helps in preseving a marriage and make it durable to weather many unforseen storms.<br>  Remember even though they are of marriageable age they are still young and inexperienced to take serious decisions and just like in any other field you need expert guidance .. more so in such matters as marriage as it has a life-long impact.|`|6b0183be8b59d389afaeae26f5356580aa	Huh.

I tried the bar scene, Art Galleries, Church, Football games and just about everything else. Yes even the pool halls and bowling alleys.  <br>  People always judge others by their looks first instead of what is in their hearts, and it's sometimes hard to talk with some one's heart, if your face to face, and maybe the other person is shy in person, but put a key board in there hands, and they might talk up a storm.  <br>  I've been single now for 8 years, and I AM NOT looking for a beautiful woman, (as far as looks go) I am looking for a beautiful person, who is a woman.  <br>  The internet in my opinion, is the safe way to find someone, yesssss, you going to surf, but listen to their words, chat with them, look for honesty.  <br>  I've found that if a person has a hard time putting his or her thoughts in words, then there is going to be a communication problem.  Recent Pictures are a must, just another way of finding honesty. <br>  I can spend more time here on line in the comfort of my home, rather out spending hard earned money looking someone, who may not be in that area in the right time.  <br>  I know what your saying, you want to grow with someone right off the bat, but you know, there are many people out there, who put on different faces to suit their needs, so to me, the internet is a good way to start, then if your comfortable with them, go meet some where neutral and see what happens.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck on your journey, it's not going to be easy, but any thing good doesn't come easy!!!<br>  <br>  Curt

Telling someone what's REALLY going on is important in a situation where other people are intervening and making things up.<br>  <br>  2. If he doesn't trust you, he isn't worth trying to convince. You said he hasn't bothered to find out what you're really like; in that case, I would leave him well enough alone. He's not worth your time if he won't give YOU the time to find out more.<br>  <br>  3. Your comments were probably blown way out of proportion. I wasn't there, but that's probably the case. He might also be extra sensitive to something like that. Some people don't take compliments well (or are overly suspicious by nature) so he might have gone into overload.<br>  <br>  If he's someone worth it, he'll be the man in the situation and accept your apology and find out more BEFORE getting suspicious.

They are what matters not the plastic people of society who care a damn about anyone else other than themselves. And in the end what matters is loving yourself. That's the first thing you should do and never stop.

(my opinion) some do, some don't make it a part. if it's good, it WILL be a part. depending on how much you're in love and how good the lovemaking and oral is, it should be done often. sometimes, it's good just to give the oral to please your mate w/out the sex. it depends. you'll get multiple opinions on this one. it basically depends on the couple. everyone is different...if you find that someone that matches your passion, affection and sex drive, the skies the liimit...!!! that's the best I can tell you...  : )|`|f1135d39fc86bed7afbc634228ee2aa8aa	sex everynight or atleast every other nigt.<br>  I love giving oral to a lady,recieving is fun to,about the same as sex everynight or everyother night.<br>  <br>  it really hasen't changed=)

Their children would be my "heirs" so to speak, and they would have a special palace set asside for us to all live. Two of them per night would sleep with me, though most nights I would probably be too tired to do too much. Mostly, they'd be for warmth and comfort, although I am a man and they are women and it would be understood that I had full rights.<br>  <br>  Then I'd sell time slots with me on eBay. A woman would have to pass a physical and submit a current photograph to be eligable to bid. Also, I would set aside special time periods where only certian kinds of girls could bid: Mondays, the 3:00-5:00 session, for example, is set asside for virgin girls between 18 and 25.<br>  <br>  I would also set up options for "lower income" girls. For one, all the girls in my harem would be lower income. Then I'd go on tour once a year to college campuses and play "make me an offer," where girls could win a free night with me by making the most interesting offer. Girls who wait outside my home in a line are given a physical and, if they pass, allowed on a first-come, first serve basis at specified times. These lines might require waiting a week or more, but it would be a girl's best chance of getting into my harem.|`|bc1eb4bdf6f7297e6e8790521a5ee23aaa	I'LL JUST GET IT ON WITH WHOEVER IS NEXT IN LINE AND MAKE SURE I WILL STAY STRONG ENOUGH TO F$%^ THEM ALL, IT LIKE DOING CHARITY WORK, AS MUCH AS I CAN AND AS MANY AS I CAN..WHEW!|`|f13b44ddf2f91d1aaba20581070bd1d1aa	Oh man who cares.

After going through them, I'd then choose the most intelligent. After those, I go back to the good-looking women who got back in shape after having my first child. Then I do the good-looking women who still look good after my second child. I'd keep that up until there aren't anymore good-looking women left or I'm dead.
94919056dbd2381993965ac48f8fd091aa	You probably just need a lower does of birth control.  The first time I got on it I was sick all the time and it was just because the doses were too high.

If you are not ready for a child I strongly suggest you STAY on birth control until you're ready.  <br>  <br>  However, since he's already said, "do what you want" - you need to talk to him about getting off of it and talking about what would happen if you became pregnant.|`|1df56fb91ef0bf12d525ab2de00cbb3baa	Just tell him.

N7gOE1btaa	I used to try and help lonely/needy people alot, and basically all of them eventually took advantage of me.  I don't know why that is exactly, but I see it time and again with anyone who helps those people you are refering too.  I think the only way is to boost their confidence without getting close to them.  I don't know the situation you are in, but if at school just say something like nice shirt, good job on that test...I don't know--adjust it to whatever works for your situation.|`|83b41af6e9dad5161f377d8dd731e945aa	You may not be able to.  I am in the exact same boat. <br>  When I tried to help people like that- they sucked me dry.<br>    The only way you can help theses people is if there is a set time amount- or other external limits that prevent you from being burned out.<br>  <br>  People who want to help, communicate empathetically.  People who NEED the help often cannot communicate with you without drawing more energy then you can give.  They often telegraph "NEED!  NEED!" and then you respond- and then you get all used up.<br>  <br>  I had to get rid of some who was TOXIC to me.  I think she is an excellent example why you would need external limits on your help to others<br>  <br>  <br>  I am a type of person who hates conflict.  While I have no problem "Standing up" for myself when it comes to those outside my circle of friends and family- once they are in the circle (and I don't consider you in the circle unless you are VERY close to me)  I have no defense against "NEED"<br>  <br>  My friend was half way in, half way out of my close inner circle- enough to often make me give in to her needs at my expense.<br>  <br>  I do Mean NEEDS- I have no problem saying no to "wants".<br>  <br>  The bad thing, is that when she communicated with me- the WAY she communicated- her body language her word content, her voice tone- tings she asked for were either "I could care less"(Low NEED)  or "I REALLY  NEED IT"(HIGH NEED)  <br>  <br>  No one  else I work with day to day has problem communicating in this manner, (and have not really run into anyone else like this)  so I think that this is just HER.  I have no problem balancing my needs with other people.<br>  <br>  My settings are this in any close relationship:<br>  >Low Need- as long as I don't mind, and it's not hard, sure!<br>  >Medium need- As long as MY needs do not go unmet because of YOUR Needs, I will give it a try.<br>  >High need: I can't let someone close to me go without, and in need. I will do what I can, and if at my own expense, then so be it.<br>  <br>  She NEVER had a medium setting- She had a high percentage of high-needs.<br>  <br>  She would make sure I would spend every break and lunch at work with her.  <br>  She would mock-pout if I missed too many in a row.<br>  I would see her almost every day, and then she would call me at night when I got home.  I saw her more then my husband.<br>  <br>  I was being smothered.  finally all hell broke loose when I walked in the door one day- the phone rang immediately- and my husband gets mad at me because I didn't pay attention to him (greet him, talk about the day) before answering the phone and talking to her.<br>  <br>  I just lost it and stressed out.  I felt like I was trapped by her, she was smothering her and I could never get a break from her because she was ALWAYS THERE at work.<br>  <br>  I would have been fine,I would have calmed down and kept her as a friend, but she as there the next day.. and bought tickets to an event that I told her numerous times that I didn't want to go to (too expensive)  and she just plugged her ears, went "LA LA LA"  and bought them anyway.<br>  <br>  I blew up at her because I told her I KNEW she was going to force me to pay for the tickets, because they were WAY too expensive not to use and pay for, and she was going to make me go.<br>   It was the classic way she would interact with me.  I would say 'no'  she would ignore me, and just say "yes" .  I would say 'no' and she would say "yes" - and keep at it, until I stopped saying 'no'.<br>  I honestly think she thought herself to be "convincing me"  but she was really beating me into submission.  <br>  When she refused to listen to my 'no"- and RESPECT it- she was signaling to me that her 'needs' were too great to be ignored. This is an unspoken rule with anyone in my close circle- it is how NEED is gauged.  This rule does not work outside the close circle, and multiple "yes" from the outside can easily be ignored.  If someone inside wants something from me, I can say 'no'- and then it's THEIR turn to gauge how badly their need is against my needs. (and I tell them what my needs are)  Everyone else in my inner circle understands this unspoken barter system-I don't burn out from them- but she obviously did not understand it.<br>  <br>  She was sucking my soul dry with her constant need.<br>  <br>  <br>  That was it.  I told her I could no longer be her friend, she stressed me out, and her personality was too dominate, and she had me doing things I did not want to do.<br>  <br>  I think that you can volunteer at a particular location- and whenever you leave, you go home.  NEVER NEVER mention you can do XXX on your freetime for someone. EVER!  make it your rule, lie if you must- tell yourself that refusing to take it home allows you to continue for longer without burn out.

d5fe4b36e3ab53f2898e8527bc845ac1aa	Difficulty: Moderately challenging<br>  <br>  There are many ways to toilet train your child, and various experts consider many of them controversial. Remember that your child will give you signs to indicate readiness for the big step.<br>  <br>  Instructions <br>  STEP 1: Assess your toddler's readiness for toilet training. Ask yourself these questions: Does your toddler follow simple instructions? Dislike having a soiled diaper? Know words for stool and urine? Sit for 5 minutes or more attending to a project? Understand the physical signals indicating the presence of urine or stool? Have dry periods for 2 hours or longer? Wake up dry from naps? These are all good indications that you can start introducing your toddler to the potty. STEP 2: Buy a potty or toilet seat. Choose one that will suit the needs and preferences of both you and your toddler. Do you want one you can take with you anywhere? Do you want one that will rest safely on public toilets? Do you want one that makes music? Don't be surprised if your child doesn't agree with the one you think is right. STEP 3: If you feel comfortable, have your child sit on his potty with clothes on while you, your spouse, or another person of the same sex as your child goes to the bathroom. Don't try to restrain your child or force him or her to sit down. If your toddler shows extreme fear or disdain for the potty, put it away and try again, or let your child explore the toilet seat independently. STEP 4: Sit your child on the toilet seat without a diaper when he or she shows no signs of fear. Explain to your child what is supposed to happen on the potty. Don't be surprised if nothing happens for a long time. After two-plus years of passing urine and stool in a diaper, change will come slowly. STEP 5: Create a toilet routine. Following a routine will set up your child for success. Place your toddler on the toilet at specific times of day - first thing in the morning, right before or after a nap, and right before bed. STEP 6: Be patient. Some children become urine-trained before becoming stool-trained. Other children wet the bed up to age 7 or 8. All children develop and accept change differently.|`|9332051206eab5fd5c156d670de5c839aa	the tiolet might be trying to gobble her up.<br>  <br>  As for toilet training, if she is wearing diapers at age three, let her sit in em for a few hours.  Let her know if she doesn't like being wet then she needs to learn to use the toilet.|`|AA10375363	get her a small toilet|`|18dc2c19d10a1881fe0c0fa6ae6405a2aa	Try a baby potty with a favorite character on it....works very well...also reward for using the potty.|`|24620e8b7606ae6e57700fd9fc0165abaa	tell her if she passes urine outside the toilet,all will say "shame shame puppy shame,all the donkey say your name".so it is better to go to toilet every one hour and remind her"let's go the toilet now,it is more than one hr,or else you might pass it in ur dress,and you will get urine infection if u dont wash after urinating.|`|AA10911184	Let her see and watch others to get the idea and explain to her while she is watching that should take the gooble away. And then I would let her pick out her most favorite carachater in panties that always helps get things moving along with a potty chair. Don't worry she will do it. Within the next few months she will be done and on her own and u will be thinking I wish she was still in diapers everytime she hollars for u to come help her wipe her butt.

T3b4I4kXaa	You need to talk to your mom about the depression. You cannot get any prescription medicines without a parent. If you make the point that the situation is getting you down, you may be able to get her attention.<br>  <br>  Quite frankly, I think you should consider the less problematic and non-toxic herbal route... hit the health food store and pick up a preparation called "Happy Camper" or another called "Holy Basil"... both are excellent and just take the cloud off your shoulders and help you to focus... and it lifts your mood.<br>  <br>  You need more of a support network. Try talking to the counselor at your school... even if all they can do is just give you a shoulder to cry on, that alone is a tremendous help.<br>  <br>  You are right... you should not be stuck in the role of primary caregiver at your age. None of this is within your realm of control. Your job is to provide emotional support to your mom and to get your education... your job is going to school.<br>  <br>  Talk to your mom again about the divorce. She can start intercepting financial statements of all kinds now for reference in court. She is entitled to 1/2 of all assets acquired during the marriage...it doesn't matter whose name it is in. That includes 401K, IRAs, savings, real estate, cars and what-not.<br>  <br>  Take her to the local bookstore and put the latest edition of the "do it yourself" divorce guide for your state into her hands. Some editions have all the forms on a CD inside the jacket. She can get herself free of him and have enough to start over with.|`|zHmZkMStaa	If you live in or near a larger city, look up Al-anon.

Ask him what qualities he likes about you, and if he starts with you're pretty, you have a cute face, you have a sexy butt, or some such like that, then he's attracted to you physically.<br>  <br>  However if he really gives you a long list of your good qualities (and remember, sometimes a quality you may think of as bad, a guy who likes you will think of it as good) without putting too much of a focus on your looks, then chances are he likes you for who you are and not for your hot body.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	whenever you see him  again  do this: lol i created a little dialogue lol<br>  <br>  you: hey babe :) wats up<br>  <br>  your bf: i love you __________ ( your name)<br>  <br>  you: me too <br>  <br>  <br>  - start talikg about something ( whatever youll talk about)<br>  -after like a while drop in the question<br>  <br>  you: hey baby what do you like about me? <br>  <br>  <br>  - if he says things like about your body and nothing that has to do with your personality then hes obviously in it for the looks......<br>  <br>  - if he says things about your body then be like " oh so you dont like my personality? my creativity?  etc. because you only mentioned physical features......|`|affb62fc89aec6d30cc223d30648b80daa	You don't ask him.

AA12244395	Okay, I'm going through the same thing, because I just started at a new school.  Just smile a lot, because then, you'll look approachable.  Just smile when you make eye contact with random people, and that'll make a great first impression.  You don't want to scare anyone, so look like you're a friendly person.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you find someone that you feel a good vibe from, go up to them and introduce yourself.  Remember, you don't have to approach other people alone!  Just grab a couple of your friends, and go up to other people together, so you don't have to be so scared.  <br>  <br>  It does take a lot of courage, but it'll be totally worth it at the end when you end up with a bunch of friends!

I don't wanna hurt them. I prefer 'guilty' ones.|`|8063d4e1674db0713cc6b8b3e1fe4611aa	yup i do|`|cea7ea3031d04142e974ba2ba92d1abdaa	Well, that depends on the extent of the term.. Innocent as in goody2shoes is annoing :p no seriously, most guys like a little attitude in a girl.. when someone says the word "woman" you think of a beautiful , sexy, confident and sensitive female, so it's really up to the dude on what type of girl to pick.. a guy could preffer a bitchy chick, but fall for a quiet and misterious one nonetheless.. if you're innocent-like and think about guys not liking that, that's silly.. if you know how to play the game you can get any guy you want and be yourself.. you shouldn't change the way you are or act in order to be accepted liked or loved by anyone. Odds are they don't know what's good for them ;)|`|20fc243a392c434cdbc00ba8ef8646aeaa	innocense is unexperianced|`|0ec82562a26aa12a1149c87e311c0d12aa	the only ones i date =D|`|8d2a4a83b7fd01bc8ec598239d67d8ccaa	they r not my type thats for sure so the answer is no|`|a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	i do, but it woudlnt matter to me if a girl i fell in love whit was innocent or not, and frankly there really isnt any such thing as innocent anymore|`|bb86acdf9d56f21b55847d565686df2aaa	it still depends on who you fall in love with...<br>  age doesn't matter...|`|f97fe859d706048763bc9784d4939777aa	no, very dangerous

I dont know, test him, see what it takes to make him mad .. good luck pissing him off!|`|AA12245742	I think provoking him is childish.  The best thing to do is talk to him and ask how he reacts when he is angry and ask his family about it too, someone should be able to give you a clear answer.  Provoking him isn't the answer, its just childish.  The two of you have much to discuss before you marry.
66c6a715cf0098dc8e811c637abefe72aa	I understand that it is really hard when you break up with someone, especially when you are really into him.  You're still griefing for the loss of that intimacy and feelings you had shared with this person, that's why you will be more inclined to think about him; moreover, shared experiences will also mean that alot of everyday things will trigger memories of your ex.  But remember, the critical issue here is that he is your ex, and the fact that he doesn't want to talk to you anymore is a good indication that he does not wish to continue on with this relationship and that he has moved on.<br>  <br>  It is more beneficial for you to create new memories of your own to get over this man.  Go out, experience life and grow, be engaged in things that makes you and only you happy... there are perks to being single, you don't have to please anyone else but you!  And I know you probably won't want to hear this, but you should let him be... if he doesn't want to talk to you, and you persists in trying to talk to him, that's technically harassment even if your motives are pure.  Don't let him and your feelings for him dictate your life now, you can't make someone love you, but you can love and respect yourself.|`|696d77c05eeeb1b6066a84d3820d79eaaa	then move on and find someone else to talk to, this will also help to stop him from popping into your mind. somanywilddays@yahoo.ca<br>  if you like we can chat|`|74430363573d51ed93d8304024a0c787aa	Yoe never know,text ,email or call, him you will never know unless you try, maybe he does want to talk to you but he's going threw the samething.  Just make sure that you don't set your self up for even more of a heart ach if he doesn't want to talk to you. Just give it some thought,and maybe a lil more time see how you feel.

kGkUG0fKaa	I used to listen to my mother but I stopped a long time ago. I am 26 now and when my mother gives me advice, I listen but I make sure to get my point across. I appreciate her concerns and advice but in order for me to liv emy life and go through my own obstacles and what not, I need to make decisions for myself and decide for myself what to do. No one, not even your own mother can tell you how you feel or what type of person you are. the older one gets, the more they develop their own sense of who they are and if you let someone, including your parent taint your own judgement of who you are, how will you know what you really want and need? how can you make decisions for yourself without needing that extra input to tell you if you are right or wrong. I'm not saying rebel against her and what she is saying but simply get your point across. if it is easier to just let her talk then do so but if you feel she is wrong, let her know. don't argue but let her know that you feel she is not right about what she "thinks" about you and show her that you can think for yourself and you have an idea of what you need to do for yourself.|`|6U4sl15uaa	you will be the only one who truly knows what you like or dislike or weather you will be happy or not so keep inconsideration about some things she says but try to find out for yourself my mother was the same way and I let her control me for so long now when we spend time together I can barely stand to spend more than 1 hour with her|`|AA11485494	holy cow, your 18 take control of your life|`|bWpYLSKSaa	I think that your mother isn't seeing the good side of you. Take her criticism in hand, but don't make it your whole life. Focus on what's good about you, not what she says is bad about you. You are your own person with your own personality, and only you can really know exactly how and who you are. If you want, ask her why she always criticizes you, but be polite and calm; don't start a fight. Always get your own point across, because your opinions matter as well. Who knows? Maybe she's the one who's really unhappy. Although if you're eighteen, you might want to start taking control and going to college or moving out. Independence can really help people.|`|vqEaTmU2aa	It's completely normal for us to take our parents seriously, even when they are being completely irrational. Like if they tell me I suck, I basically believe that. So it sounds like you do the same thing as I do... and probably many others, too. You take what they say and internalize it.<br>  <br>  I think the best way around this is to surround yourself with positive people who can make you feel better about yourself, that will give you compliments and tell you that you DON'T suck. So that way you are able to ignore your mother, or at least not have to take everything she says so seriously.<br>  <br>  This is what I've had to do - although I was never able to find people who could do that, I had to find a therapist instead! Yeah, hopefully you won't have to resort to that... haha.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I believe in you!|`|7b41e58a21eefd3df561dd1d0510e173aa	ha ha...sounds like a common story but trust me dat instead of taking this stuff as nagging, take it in the right spirit and think of it dat she is trying to tell you how to improve. being you mom, she is prob the only now who can be straightforward about your shortcomings! you can make her stop saying this stuff by trying to show her that you are changing! like if she says you're selfish, do some awesome selfless act and let her know bout it! is she thinks you take too much stress, tryout some meditation and let her witness that you're tryin to change. the reason she says it soo much is cuz she feels you dun take her seriously! well if you show her that you do, then she will be easier on you! :)|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	if you are 18 and have to ask this question. she is absolutely right!
kiY9kihbaa	My ex-girlfriend has a real puffy coat.  And she looked amazing, so it wasn't like she was trying to hide anything.  It's funny how something like that can be sexy on a girl:)|`|Yxaht4Cbaa	Guys I know let me know that my full length slim but down- filled coat wasn't cool 'cause it was too poofy.  I didn't ask them, and I really don't care what they think, 'cause it is a practical coat of elegant cut and keeps me from getting sick.  I don't like to be cold, so if they want to hang around dumb chicks that get the flu, so be it!!!|`|JblWZcbbaa	It depends.<br>  <br>  If the girl is cute, then it can be cute.<br>  <br>  If the girl is gross, it won't be cute.<br>  <br>  If it's like.. the North Face, then NO.

A goat would look at someone in a puffy coat and skinny jeans simply because it's an awkward disproportionate living object.  The quoting of real guys thing is something you girls need to realize is way often fake and made up - geez does it take einstein to admit that possibility..?<br>  <br>  Personally - no it's not that attractive, sadly I believe your mistaken.  A girl wearing something revealing or tight is still more of an eye catcher.  If it's really big and puffy than guys would probably either think you are way stuck up or perhaps you are a some sort of inside freak.  Thus just want to have sex with you or light you on fire for fun, so there - that's the type of attention you would get and I personally do no recommend it.  Unless you want that kind of..|`|mnWaURXraa	I think she must be warm in that big puffy coat and it is cute, depending on the girl and as long as she isn't in a warm state waring it in the summer.|`|YQYZR7I0aa	she has alot to hide. very interesting. i would be go for her. it gives a mistery that tells me she is shy and need someone to offload the burden she has on|`|OBbuiqZ3aa	are you really going to walk around in a big coat on the chance some guy will think its cute?<br>  wow. <br>  pathetic.|`|DXrdLqkjaa	sure as long as its winter|`|USsjb7YLaa	i think it means they like to cuddle lol only if there hot if there not attractive its like there hiding them selves|`|huUUzF7Xaa	I'm not a guy...but every guy I know jokes that they look like marshmallows...|`|qYe02dY7aa	if its summer time? i would think she's weird/crazy/dum.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	I would think that she has a shotgun and that she is going to rob the place, because it is too hot for a coat now.<br>  <br>  Answer mine:|`|2tn8EALqaa	....rofl|`|4PdcTUCQaa	big coat means either they hidin their fat or a stripper with not much else on underneath walkin to their job.

If it spills over into actual suggestion and solicitation, then it's another matter.  You have to establish your own limits--surely you've been around long enough to know how to do that.  If you need to tell him to back off, then do it.  His interest in your husband's work is commercial (or it should be).  If he's going to not ditch your husband as a producer bc he gets offended, then he's not professional and you don't want to work with him.  It's that simple.<br>  <br>  But this is the music industry.  You KNOW what people are like in the business.<br>  <br>  I also think you might want to give your husband the heads-up if it looks like you are going to have to say something.|`|E9onWPJQaa	Okay now see, you sound really STUPID right now.

That can't happen if he loses trust in you and divorces you.<br>  <br>  So, that said: Do not go with your husband to "work". You either stay home or continue in your own job. <br>  <br>  Let your husband know of ANY flirting men even if they are responsible for your husband's career. If your husband cares for you enough he will take it seriously. He will handle it.<br>  <br>  Do not satisfy ANY men with your responses/reply's. Ignore them completely.  If any of these men ask you concerning your husband always answer in a short and stern manner. Alaways, dress very modestly, (loose fitied clothing that covers your extremities).<br>  <br>  Do not smile, look, or speak to ANY man, stay hom / or go some where else, <br>  <br>  At this time when your husband's career is really getting a boost the last thing he needs is a lack of trust and honesty from you.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect his career and your marriage this is the least sacrifice you can do.|`|941bdc645ba35ed9c1988fbce6d2ace8aa	It sounds like you like the attention. If it really bothered you then your husband would know about this and you would have stopped going with him to his work.<br>  I had the same situation with one of the Marines my husband worked with I told my husband about it and I stopped going to his shop because I didn't want to encourage that kind of behavior since I am a Married woman.<br>  <br>  And the shameless promotion, please, use some common sense.

Y8KmfOOsaa	hey so i'm a grade ten girl and i know a lotta guys who go to an all guys school actually.<br>  <br>  luckilly their all-guys school is like, sister schools with an all girls school, so at parties it's a mix of the two single-sex schools.  do you maybe have that with your school?<br>  <br>  if not, there's tons of places to meet girls. they're everywhere.  the mall is of course a good place but you don't wanna do that.<br>  <br>  so there's always cafes, on the streets, downtown, in a movie theatre, at a club event (great way to meet girls), at parties, friends of friends, facebook, waiting in line anywhere, camp during the summer, amusement parks (like canada's wonderland for example) is another grea way to meet all sorts of people, on the subway.  basically anywhere you go outside of school will have girls.  it's just a matter of being confident and comfortable enough to start up a conversation.  try to do more public stuff. <br>  <br>  i for example go to these random events called "free hugs". you go downtown with a bunch of people and hold up signs saying "free hugs" and hug strangers all day.  there hasn't been a free hugs where i haven't met at least thirty people in one day, guys and girls.<br>  <br>  so whatever you do, be social, get out there, go to events and parties and clubs and whenever you see a girl or a group of girls don't be scared to talk to them.<br>  <br>  the key is to be outgoing, not shy.  when meeting girls spontaneously you have to make a strong impression. you are, of course, just randomly starting up a conversation in hopes of getting to know the girl(s) so don't be a shy little boy.  haha :)<br>  <br>  i just find it hard to believe you never meet girls at parties.  there's no way you go to an all guys school with guys that no NO girls.  at all.  noooo way.<br>  <br>  anyway, hope i've helped GOOD LUCK! :)|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	well most girls hang out around the block  n walk with friends....well thats wat all uf the people(girls sum guys) do near me....usually in groups tho...my friend n i were walkin 2dayn stuf...group of 3. me her n dis guy<br>  <br>  <br>  if u get 2 kno 1 girl, she wil have friends, n her friends wil have friends n they mite introduce u to them if they think ur a cool guy..<br>  <br>  gud luck|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	you can meet them at the beauty salon|`|aT7YJy3Kaa	THE MALLL!!! i go shopping (clothes and guys haha) all the time with my girls. ohh, haha<br>  <br>  sporting events, hmm<br>  i heard that like, if u like books, hangout at a library or bookstore, bc there u'll find someone who likes books. if u like skateing, hang at the skate park and u'll find a skater, and etc.<br>  <br>  but seriously, the mall. dont be afraid to just go up to a girl. be like "hey, im buying a bday present for my sister. could i get ur advice" <-- that line is bomb!! and i thought the guy who said it was hella cool for having enough balls to talk to me.|`|19a16fd526f17ef5281ba84b9310daa2aa	the best place for a high schooler is high school.

AA11119626	Hmm. This is one of those "depends" questions.<br>  <br>  Depends on you, depends on her. Depends on your relationship, how long you were together, why and how you broke up.<br>  <br>  Even in the best circumstances - you both just realized it wasn't working out, so you mutually decided to call it quits - it can still take time before you really can be comfortable around each other in the context of your new relationship.<br>  <br>  Worst circumstances - you broke off a long-term relationship with someone who didn't see it coming, and for a new love. In this case, I think most people would prefer not to see or hear or smell you for a long time.<br>  <br>  Best idea is to take a break from each other. Leave the door open, if in fact you really do want this person as a friend in the future. If you do, then you treat her like a friend. You treat her with kindness and respect, you realize that it's bound to be awkward at first, you back off for a while, and... you see what happens.<br>  <br>  After a month, or a few months, depending on the intensity of the breakup, you ask to do something neutral, like meet for coffee. You ask her straight out if she thinks the two of you might be able to be friends. If she says "yes," you coffee, and you see.<br>  <br>  If she says "no," then you respect her wishes and back away.<br>  <br>  Here's the thing - do you really, sincerely want this person to be part of your future life as a friend, or are you saying it to make yourself feel better about the breakup?

La foi est la seule chose qui permet à l'humain d'utiliser sa raison, d'affronter son instinct et d'aller contre les désirs de son ame. La foi lorsqu'elle est sincère fait également réfléchir sur les conséquences de ses actes et pousse le degré de conscience à un niveau supérieur.<br>  De nos jours de moins en moins de gens sont croyants.

But be ready for anything just in case.|`|9d41c70ee6e10d44e3c9a44eb1251c9faa	Show him that you support his plans and whatever happens you will be there for him (if you can really wait lol)...

Good luck! :D|`|aada8ece87ea558237645c3e4013d78caa	sounds like he knows what you want...tell him anyway to reiterate the point and let him know that you might not wait for him-(although you probly feel like you could)...at least get him thinking, and ask his opinion|`|02db2fc0115ea3b94253e8474b9c5015aa	I Think you should tell him,  How you feel cause  I had boyfriend<br>   i never told him that  I was in love with before.  to make long <br>  story short  Things would have turned out differently if he knew.<br>  he got back  in touch with last year when he was in Iraq.  <br>   we both wished we would have said  I love you, but never did<br>   so he now married and is happy.

woEoXfaZaa	The last thing a mom wants to do is catch her little boy (which is how she will ALWAYS see you) with erotic images of any kind.  So she was probably as embarrassed as you.  But in saying that she also knows that you are growing into a man and having changes and curiosities which all teenage boy and girl go through.<br>  <br>  She probably will ask more questions because she will want to know that you are being safe and not doing anything you should be or that is illegal.  This means that she really cares about you which you should be grateful for.<br>  <br>  Be honest with her cause if you try and lie she will know and the truth is you will probably be surprised in how understanding she is.  I wouldn't mind my son having porn magazines cause I know it is normal for a teenager to be curious and she might feel the same way.  Yes talking to her will be uncomfortable but not just for you for her too.<br>  <br>  In saying that if receiving photos of naked girls is illegal then stop.|`|SsFPt1CVaa	Your mom might start sending you erotic pictures of herself. Watch out kid.|`|4w9gmvumaa	Take your punishment from your mom.  And know that if they are underage, you can go to federal prison (for getting them through the interney).  The FBI will get that azz.  <br>  <br>  Besides that, your mom might think you are a pervert and wonder what you do with the pictures.  Just tell her you were curious and that you are experiencing normal feelings about the opposite sex due to adolescent hormones, etc.  <br>  <br>  You're okay, probaby just embarassed.  But in the future, don't break the law.  Just get a Playboy magazine or something.|`|N7gOE1btaa	First off, what you did is now illegal.  You cannot send or receive erotic pictures like that.  So stop doing that!<br>  Secondly, and to address your point, your mom will act weird and she will likely yell at you.  You need to do your best to explain that you realize its wrong and you thought about it all night and you respect girls more than that, you just got caught up in the moment of it all.  Honestly man, don't lie to your mom with BS excuses, she will know you are lying.  I think this is the best way.
cbaed0814556c039d6513bbe51d35768aa	Six years ago you were alot younger and you were not ready for the big committment.  Apparently your ex was.  You have to quit feeling guilty about kicking her to the curb and jealous of the man who didn't,  It is time now, to move on with your life.  You did nothing wrong, she did nothing wrong, and the guy she married did nothing wrong.  Could be she was your first love too, those are harder to forget but it is time to say;  I can't keep what I don't have and move on, or you will be repeating history exactly the same with the girl you are seeing now...and maybe rather than play house, where emotions get all mixed up when there is not a mutual goal and comitment, maybe you should be seeing alot of different girls right now because your self preservation terminology tells me you still are not looking at a serious committment in the future with anyone. So I advise that instead of playing house where everybody or somebody gets hurt, just go out and date alot of women-don't get too involved with any single one.  If down the road you find you want to be involved just think:  self preservation or commitment.  If you feel inclined stronger in the first direction, keep dating and meeting different people.  If commitment seems to be finally drawing you, then go for it.  Don't be afraid to be hurt either, we all meet a few lemons and have some rejections ourselves before it all clicks.|`|89295cff4bb11d516adf176ce5d8f6acaa	damn, you got it bad, either another woman will come and make you forget about her or you need to pay more attention to your current girlfriend.

15244706e9e7d9db2eca018bf21910b4aa	Wow, this is a great question and somewhat difficult to answer.  I'll plunge right in.<br>  <br>  I want one who is a virgin, although I suppose I could be forgiving if she's not.  I want one who is kind and understands and accepts I might not be perfect and is willing to help me and receive help from me.  It would be nice to get one with whom I connect well.  When I feel at ease, like I can just talk to her without fear because she will be a great friend, I love it.  I suppose it would be fine to build a connection over time too.  I want someone who will insist on respecting me and demand that I respect her.<br>  <br>  Other things would be fun.  Someone who looks at me and smiles.  Someone who is open about how she feels (unless she doesn't trust me yet).  I admit that beauty is a factor, how can I help it?  But I am ready to start seeing it in someone for whom she is.  If I see she wants to be a good friend and not walk off ASAP when I am around, well, I like that.<br>  <br>  I hope I did OK.  I'm not sure most guys want all those things.|`|4cKNT0xlaa	i like a girl that is around my age, smart, funny, someone that won't use me,someone cute, you know, that kind of stuff,and someone that is around my hight.|`|f064818470d93690a4f2824e82198cfbaa	Same age, beautiful, funny, fun to be around, good body, personality.<br>  <br>  *In reply to your email*<br>  I meant same age as me.<br>  I am 13 by the way.

6t68dbfoaa	As both of you are imperfect people (as we all are), it's impossible for different people to spend all of their time together and get along all of the time.  However, if you live together and don't spend time together, that isn't healthy either.  You probably need to find a happy medium where both of you respect each others need for personal time as well as spending some quality time together doing fun things.  Moving in together is a big step and can be a beautiful thing, but it does take work, much like a marriage.  It's not all rainbows and unicorns!  <br>  <br>  But that being said, it can work if you both are willing to put in the effort.  Communication will be of a huge benefit as you may be doing something that drives him bonkers or vice versa.|`|muOxoDGOaa	Honey, I am sorry about all the drama.

You need to look at how you spend your time together. Do you spend it cleaning, cooking or watching TV. My advice, turn the TV off and talk about your day. Set aside one night a week for a romantic dinner out of the house. You also need to set aside one day where you do stuff separately from each other. <br>  It also helps that if you are in a bad mood, tell your boyfriend why. It stops a lot of fights if you just say I'm tired or cranky. That way it is not taken personally. It can be hard work to start with, but is worth it in the end. Good luck, I hope it all works out for you.

Maybe there's something that holds him back because two years ago, I really liked one of my guy friends, (or so I thought), but whenever we went to a movie or biking alone, I felt like we were just really close friends. But then when we were texting or talking to each other online, I'd feel like I really liked him. For me, I think that it was because I liked being with him that I thought I like-liked him, but because he wasn't mature enough, I only liked him as a friend. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying you're immature! (Sorry if you got that idea!) But maybe there's something about the relationship that would feel weird to him, yet he does like you for you, since when you text, he does like you. Maybe you'll just have to give it a bit more time... I'll let you know what eventually happened, the guy that I thought was just a close friend changed a little bit (not for me, but just naturally), and now we're dating!<br>  <br>  So good luck with your friend! I hope he realizes what a great person you truly are. And if not, give it time, as I said before, and he'll probably see that he does like you! :)|`|b02c7e5de4d776df907cfafdabdbc62eaa	When he says he likes your texts better than speakin in person with you is because you cannot come up with the right things to say on the fly. In texting you are able to think of what you are going to type, and say "the right things," and you are no good @ it in person.<br>  <br>  I don't think he likes you, and maybe the whole not liking "seeing you in person" thing is that you are just not that attractive to him.<br>  <br>  Just what I think make you own judgment.|`|FEfi8h8oaa	i believe this is a new one.. ive never heard of guy say he likes a girl in text only..not in person. anyway texting is NOT a relationship! if he really liked you he would like you "in person". so he obviously doesn't like you sorry hun!|`|YQYZR7I0aa	HE IS CHICKEN OR HE HAS MORE THAN ONE GIRL HE DOES NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT.

Make sure that he is not just trying to get "power" established by making you eager for him.  If he's got him arm around you one second, then acting kina distant the next, he's playing a game.  Make sure he has real feelings for you, you can tell when someone is being honest or not!|`|3ef3f7b33bb4dc2685483c123b4bcf9baa	Well maybe u should just flirt with him and see how things go.

Start having fun with other people.  Really have fun, not just fake it.  Don't go out of your way to be around him, but don't shun him either.  Be nice and be friendly, but don't fall to the floor and hold onto his leg.  If he likes you he will come closer and start being more of a "boyfriend".|`|AA10375363	no...let it rest

Like file for a restraining order or the police and file harassment charges on her. This may make her stop. Sounds like she is 5 cans short of a six pack.

You obviously don't want to get back together with her.  If it comes down to it and the funds aren't a problem, maybe changing your number is one way to get her attention.   Try hanging out at different places.  It not only will throw her off your track but you may enjoy the change of scenery|`|395f03016710522defcc1cc81c8cfaf9aa	tell her your gay and that she turned you that way she will drop ur *** like a hot potato

g7T5jox1aa	maybe she has something going on at home, this could make her upset and withdrawl from her friends at school... but she may be embarassed about it and feel like she can't talk to any one.  she may want to forget about it, so just try and be a ggod friend, if she wants to move on, let her and after she sees that you are her friend through al of this she may start sharing her frustrations.

The best thing to do is watch out for the little things he does....and if he's willing to spend a lot of time with you and not push getting into your pants, you know you've found him. Good luck =)|`|QWevnlTUaa	if they call you baby/babe/etc.<br>  if you are a total ***** to them, and they stick around.<br>  if they insist on making love to you during the day in a parking lot.<br>  if they are constantly making out with you in front of their friends.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	honestly idk...... i think its a very good question though....|`|TvPcTqdsaa	go as long as you can without having sexual relations... don't give him too much of your time and don't give him too little... you gotta dangle the carrot kinda close, even let the rabbit get a lick.. but don't let it bite... this may be hard for you to do as well especially if you have a strong physical attraction, but patience is key... the only reason i'm saying this is because a girl who i've been trying to get into a relationship with is doing this to me, and she has made it somewhat clear that she is worried about the same thing you are worried about. If the guy is serious, he will wait... but only if you keep making him feel like you are interested in him and him only... not other guys... good luck
fuIUOJ2paa	Well because I would think it would be just a little werid if my boyfriend did it. I mean people do it all the time but you just can't imagune someone you hang out with exspcially your boyfriend.

Thats why she cant get past it.|`|xcF30urOaa	Because if you have a girlfriend , then you shouldn't be masturbating .(Unless you guys don't have sex)<br>  Then maybe just the thought of you doing that creeps her out.<br>  Honestly , it wouldn't bother me but that's what your girlfriend might think|`|BO28Mn8haa	masturbating? seriously? thats her biggest problem with you? <br>  <br>  call me...|`|a8560dffc68323babeca5570faca48b6aa	she's insecure.  masturbating is natural|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Its something that upsets her it may be making her feel unimportant or insecure, are you watching porn when you do it? If you care about her you should respect her feelings and not do it or only do it with her, in turn you should be able to expect the same respect when something comes up that upsets you.|`|t0PzSCs0aa	she might either take it as you do not find her to be 'good enough' and have to seek pleasure elsewhere.<br>  <br>  or she is uncomfortable with the thought of you thinking of her.<br>  <br>  it depends on how close your relationship is. you should ask her whats on her mind and talk it out. maybe you can come to an understanding.|`|WyWHvUXJaa	it is unhealthy - makes you go blind.  I can hardly see the keyboard nowadays!|`|wHgBnMipaa	She probably feels like you don't need her, and this can be a very degrading feeling sometimes.

Just don't talk about it and maybe she'll feel better.|`|yvRrvSyPaa	u could have sex with her other than masturbating|`|fmkwdNJyaa	now you that makes her feel like "why am I here?|`|xWq93Ckyaa	it shouldn't matter. it's completely normal. she'll get over it, don't worry.<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ap5WGI7XOuOWY9X8zWYM7GPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309193345AAs1nvN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|DYttAN4jaa	hmm- personally, i'd prefer a guy who did that than with someone else!   Consider yourself lucky, girlfriend!|`|0EB2ZR0Gaa	Why is it even any of her business?  Why does she know anything about this?  That's the sort of thing you should keep private.  And the reason for that is the same as the reason for your question:  Sometimes it bothers people to think about that.  You may need to find a girlfriend who is more open and relaxed about sexuality.|`|hXF6p4mAaa	The matter is that she needs to pull the stick out of her butt and realize that it is perfectly normal and helathy behavior. One day she will understand that it's not a big deal. I don't care that my boyfriend does it occasionally because it doesn't affect our intimate life. The only reason she should ever complain is if you masterbate instead of doing something with her.|`|hOU7pYdmaa	Stop doing it in public while you're looking at her|`|OuvVLh2maa	coz she is jealous to your hand hahahahahaha|`|kKOzl9nUaa	Because women are insecure especially when it comes to sex. If a new relationship you are saying in women talk "I am not satisfying my man so he does this". You will need to talk to her as it could be a upbringing thing where she just sees as wrong. Be honest and she will try to understand it doesn't mean she ever will.|`|4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	Maybe she wants to be the one to please you....|`|rhvA4G4Paa	Well it probably makes her feel like shes not satisfying sexually, as in "Well I must not be doing it right for him so he has to do it himself."<br>  <br>  I mean, idk, maybe you do just like doing it yourself once in a while. I would explain that this has nothing to do with her not satisfying you|`|HReDTDExaa	maybe because she feels like its akward|`|fPpmgxjuaa	dude i got the same prob...my gf hates it...she thinks its nasty and thinks that its a desparate move|`|UUJxZAfSaa	honestly, she sounds immature<br>  <br>  i mean it happens and sometimes guys need to do it, and there is no reason girls can not do it either|`|27fe1e3ae697035fd2660cec751b7997aa	she probably feels disturbed knowing that you are doing that and prefers that you do it on your own time. talk to your gf about it. thats a good question but i think she can really answer it =)  dont worry to much.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer mine???<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aql6lSFDLfQ3JTZTUckbhojsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306153258AAJkDuo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|uLyBjMonaa	maybe the idea of it just weirds her out ..its ok she'll get used to it someday <br>  <br>  PLEASE ANSWER!

99193d34fb187b6ea3af8b00a6a9ce62aa	I think you should be proud of yourself.  You have will power. I can't say that he's doing the same thing because none of us know that or should even assume that. I don't think, though, that you should feel guilty for talking to other men or even being interested a little bit.  You're taking a break-so use it as one and do a little soul searching.  You need to be appreciated and if he can't do that right now, then there's nothing wrong with a little looking of your own.  Honestly, I wouldn't tell him anything.  Nothing happened so it's not worth a big fight.  Plus he could use that as ammunition and end things for good using that as an excuse!  Best of Luck!|`|9yj86j0Caa	You're being delusional.  He broke up with you, therefore, he is no longer your boyfriend.  My guess is he is interested in someone else and didn't tell you to save your hurt feelings.  Don't spend too much time ruminating in your sorrow.  It will only lead to an unhealthy obsesssion for him.  Immerse yourself in your studies and wait until you are done with school to get involved again.  Break ups and heartaches will only distract you from what you need to be doing now.|`|nnYW2jVYaa	That's sweet. OK well i don't think you need to feel guilty but sometimes you just cant help it right? If he broke up with you he doesn't want you to waste your life waiting for him and i wouldn't of course it will take a little while to get over someone you loved for so long. But don't go feeling guilty. And remember to be a responsible drinker :)|`|31ahiJabaa	He has already decided on what to do with the relationship. You need to let go. Don't overeact. Don't be melodramatic, you will only drive him further away. <br>  Surely you have other worthwhile matters to put your mind into?|`|TTjDATeOaa	Your bf just broke up with you, I hope he expects that to happen. You know he met someone else already.|`|1hDhmql4aa	I'm so sorry that you are in this situation sweetie!  You sound like you have lots of good morals and don't deserve to be in love with a guy who doesn't see your worth.  It sounds as though he has moved on but is not being clear about it with you.  When a guy says " he doesn't expect you to wait" then he is seeing other people or wants to.  You have nothing to feel guilty about!!!!!!!  Don't look for love for a while and don't go wild either.  Sometimes the best thing is to go out, have fun, maybe kiss a boy here and there but find out what you really want in a guy.  Learn more about who you are and how you work then give love another go!<br>  Go and see that movie with a friend that's out!  What is it? He's Just Not That Into You!!|`|Fkjey1CVaa	Do not feel guilty. I got the same crappy line about "space and time" and he WAS cheating. He was the one who was guilty. Your BF is probably just trying to figure out what to do about it and you do not need to wait around to find out what he was actually doing. You have done nothing to be ashamed about. Do not tell your boyfriend anything, don't even call him. If it was meant to be he will grow up.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	No, you shouldn't tell him  he's just going to use it against you to make you feel better and justify it more to himself about the break up. He broke up with you. You are not together. It took me almost a year after I was divorced from my ex to finally not feel like it was cheating. I remember just going out to dinner with another guy after my divorce was final and I went home and balled my eyes out and felt dirty and guilty.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Your boyfriend was probably cheating on you anyway. Don't worry so much.|`|AA10861417	He said he needs some space.   You may be deciding if he infact wants to see other people.   There was nothing wrong with what you did because he more than likely doing the exact same thing.   He broke up with you so he doesn't feel the guilt should he decide to pursue another woman.  <br>  <br>  When you really love someone it is hard.  But if a little space will make things clear for the both of you - do it.   That way you are never wondering "what if".|`|B12E4rYiaa	No you don't ever tell you were with another man or go begging for him to give it another chance. He has made a decision and needs space. So you need to get busy with career, friends, family and hobbies something fun and productive. <br>  <br>  Forget men for a while and focus on you anyone now will be a rebound guy anyway. In time maybe the old BF will come around if not he wasn't the right guy for you.|`|ewc4AubYaa	Your not obligated to tell an ex b/f what could have happened.<br>  You said that you'd seen each other once a week.<br>   With out a doubt, I'd say that he was the one that was growing apart.<br>  It wasn't your fault. <br>  You will continue to love him. Eventually the pain in your heart will subside. Trust me it will.<br>  Continue on with your life, wasting your thoughts on him, isn't worth your time.|`|K3VhC7AMaa	You don't need to tell your bf anything since nothing happenned. He may not trust you next time. You certainly love him so take your time before meeting anyone else otherwise you will only love this person on a rebound which would not be fair on him. Good Luck!
85f60e08037f9de3e5fe232de70fe9d7aa	Sounds like he likes you. <br>  <br>  He sounds shy though and unsure if you like him.

I think you need to kick it up a notch in the flirting dept. to really see how he reacts. Ask him about what he does in his free time, and then casually invite yourself along or something. It's hard for me to say, I was always really bold with guys. Depends on how old you are...lol!

qxoGxjdsaa	I have found with these situations having open and honest communication works the best. One can never guarantee how the other person is going to react whenever important conversations arise, though if you are honest and tactful in explaining yourself and your feelings you will more often than not come out on top.

The most important thing I have heard from my family and friends is to relax. Initial pain is to be expected, but if the pain is excruciating I suggest consulting you gynecologist. Another possible explanation may be you have a highly developed sensitivity to stimuli or your vaginal opening cannot handle such trauma. I think you should look into what is personally comfortable for you and your body before you have sex with anyone else.|`|P9ZOMoagaa	Well, you gotta go through with it even though it hurts, especially if you've never actually had sex!

Also try Astroglide lubricant, get it at walgreens, target, etc.  About $7.|`|EgGxVVrBaa	Several reasons why it hurts:<br>  -You're still tight since you're a virgin<br>  -His penis may be too large<br>  -You may be dry (try some ky jelly or lube)<br>  -Relax; you're too hyped up<br>  -Ooooooooor....you may be too young...<br>  <br>  Trust me, once you're done with the initial "opening" of your vagina, it will be the greatest thing ever lol|`|hxDD9flkaa	You are probably too dry, saliva should help|`|2wNUbdVPaa	It is probably a lubrication issue.  Make sure you're using lubricated condoms, and should you still need something else use lube in conjunction (make sure it's water based.)<br>  <br>  Not to scare you, but it could potentially be an STD.<br>  <br>  Go to your doctor and let him/her know what's going on.  They should be able to get to the bottom of it and help you. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LsbzHLu1aa	well i think you shuld you schould wait depending on what is goin on it could be just getting us to that felling|`|YQYZR7I0aa	WOW. they dont know how to handle you. like i said before its takes time to have sex. especiallly u as woman should be taken gently and soft in the beginning. when thye put it inthey must go with the head for about a 1min and play around your vagina and caress it and massage and then take it a little bit deeper. <br>  <br>  NOT ALL AT ONCE. THE GUYS ARE IDIOTS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO LAST FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN THEIR ARE DONE<br>  <br>  SEX IS BEAUTIFUL. IT TAKES TIME AND IS ALL ABOUT BEING GENTLE AND CAREFUL AND STILL POWERFUL AT THE SAME TIME. <br>  <br>  MOVE ON THEY ARE STUPID|`|s9sPUG7Jaa	The vagina, when not "ready" for sex is less deep then when it is. Get a boyfreind that has good foreplay. Women can orgasm multiple times.. So orgasm once.. and your vagina should be ready for anything fersure.<br>  Thats my edumacted guess anyway. :]|`|USsjb7YLaa	not to be to vulger but ur thingy is 2 small which means ur 2 young so like yeah stop it|`|CnywgeNDaa	Relax. It always hurts the first few times you do it. It help if he turns you on extremely before you try it.

And lo, if she's the new head of school, it's probably because she has that calling, to lead, help and inspire others. I think this happens to everyone; we meet someone who simply inspires us. They're called mentors.<br>  As far as how to get to know her better, only you can figure that one out. Maybe you could just request a meeting with her, and tell her how much you admire and look up to her and would like to spend more time around her. Then, leave it up to her. <br>  I happy for you, that you've met someone who has such a good influence on you. It's an experience you'll carry with you your whole life.
3NoQuoWuaa	Everyone dabbles in fantasy land occasionally. We notice others in how they act and what they possess and wish we could be in their situation. Unfortunately we really don't know what their situation is and they may be very good at covering up a bad life. This is normal. Just go on keeping on being thankful for what you have.r

Now 12 years later you want to collect money from him even though you left the state and didn't let him know where his child was.   The adult thing to do in this situation is to understand that your child has a right to know her father and she just may desire that as she grows and matures even more.   The right and proper thing to do is let this man know where his child is and see if he desires to have a relationship with his child or not.   You probably wouldn't be granted child support under the circumstances that you yourself created from the very beginning, and why should you?

XdqvvLaiaa	people fall in love because they want to offer someone something good that they have. They want to be with someone not as to depend on him or her but to share their life with them. They have something good to offer and they want something good in return. They want to spend time with someone not because they are scared to be alone but because they enjoy the other person’s company. They are not in the relationship with closed eyes but open eyes. They can see all; the good and bad happening, and they are ignoring the bad because they are scared to be alone, or because they feel embarrassed that it’s happening to them|`|OGkEnpfRaa	Wow...tough question, but I think it might be because at first they get to know that person and spend more time with them and then later start to develop feelings for them.<br>  The more you spend time with them, the more you realize that you like them and that you have truly found a best friend in them.<br>  It happens over time, and you can't rush things or force the feelings to come.<br>  It has to happen naturally. <br>  Love is something that happens when you least expect it and when you are truly happy.<br>  Of course...considering I'm only 14, what would I know about love since no one likes me?

But if he genuinely wants to build a relationship with his father, do not try to come in between that. if you are mad that he is spending time with his father and not you then that is selfish of you, sorry to say. he is probably dealing with a lot of mixed up feelings about his father and family and  you should be there with by his side instead of complain about the time he spends with his father. if he says his father likes you then believe it and move on or just simply move on without him.

2o3BHgCCaa	I would suggest a finelines strapless bra. I am a 32C and wear mine everyday because it simply does not budge. They are also quite low cut in the front despite what the A cup model in the picture shows below. <br>  This is the one I have and LOVE:<br>  <a href="http://www.finelineslingerie.com.au/products.php?pgid=48&name=Strapless+Padded+Push-Up%2C+String+G-String" rel="nofollow">http://www.finelineslingerie.com.au/prod...</a>|`|5WP9rLTlaa	My initial though was a bustier but you can't wear one with that back detailing! <br>  I have worn a dress with a similar bodice and was actually more comfortable bra less in it (I used fashion tape to prevent the nuclear fall out I would otherwise have gotten) If I remember my sizing conversions correctly I'm a 40E cup and can symphasize completely! Unless your flat strapless bras are going to slide even with the aid of strong fashion tape. Try Triumph brand, they seem to hold a bit better than the other brands for me|`|QFnaCs5saa	Do you have a Fredericks of Hollywood near you? The best advice I could give to you, is go there and get properly fitted...then ask them what bra to buy! I apparently wear the same size bra as you (this was news to me after they measured me) and my boobs don't look huge or anything. That doesn't matter though because in the right bra they look excellent! (The bra I was buying is also for my wedding gown. It was the "extreme cleavage" bra...and it has a strapless option. Also, it does not slip, not at all...but I think that's because it fits properly.) <br>  <br>  My point it is, no bra should ever slip down in the back so the best thing to do is get fitted for one and ask the pro's! Screw those crappy sticky bra's...unless you have a really small chest they aren't for you...and you don't want to be worrying about your bra on your wedding night...you want to be carefree and focused on enjoying yourself!<br>  <br>  Good luck, congrats...and TRUST ME! Get fitted...it takes about 2 seconds and half the time the girl just looks at you and knows!|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I would get the stick on bras, and re-enforce with duck tap.  I'm not even kidding.

The back is too open.  It will inevitably slip down.<br>  <br>  Honestly, try duct tape.  I used it for a prom back in the day, but I'm only a 32B.  It's worth a shot.  Just stick it to a towel before you stick it to yourself.  Put it on the outside and bottom of your boobs, to give them lift and hold them in place.  It's like making a bra without a back out of tape.|`|VrSOaLd5aa	You need to get some cups sewn into the dress. They will give you some lift and you will not have to worry about any straps showing or a bra slipping down. If you know how to sew or know someone who does, you can go to Hobby Lobby or Joann's fabric store and buy them for about 5.00 and have some one sew them in for you.

9Eq2Xxbmaa	Just keep being there for her at any opportunity possible. Girls love whoever is there for them the most, and whoever shows them that they really care. That guy sounds like you, and if that is the case you will pass the other guy up with flying colors. Yes, she probably misses him, but it'll fade over time. Be her best friend -- girls always choose the best friend (take it from a girl who knows) <3|`|6dEXuxjRaa	Take her on a really romantic date that is filled with fun as well as love, then nbefore then end of the date drive you and her to an amazing scenic view and kiss her, she will be flattered and im sure you'll steal her heart, best of luck man!!|`|A7gaxd9Xaa	Just be there for her and if she wants to, she will be with you.  Don't worry about the other guy.  Treat her well, hold her at night, make time for her, say nice things to her etc.  If she knows whats good, she'll stick around.  Good luck!|`|bMmV6R2Jaa	Dont be a rescuer! shes not ready and still stuck on the other guy.. move on! She wouldnt be happy cause she has to work it thru and it takes time.|`|gtTg0XOOaa	There's nothing you can do really. Her heart will eventually heal on it's own. Falling out of love is hard to do. Just be yourself keep in her good graces and eventually she'll only think of you.|`|IT306Kytaa	just give her some time and stay by her side<br>  she cant get rid of her feelings that easily<br>  her feelings for him will eventually go away
cjaphGaoaa	On a first date that means 'I  want your jacket =]'<br>  <br>  if it's not a first date, give her a hug or cuddle|`|kERP7zAhaa	put your arm around her|`|qy07K2k5aa	I think it most probably means that she wants you to sit real close to her, so that she can feel your warmth. It's very sweet and romantic.|`|Lyrc2BWmaa	Yes, a girl wouldnt say that next to some weird ugly stranger.<br>  <br>  It usually means that she wants you to get close to her and that she is into you. At that moment, i would reccomend that you put your arm around her and say, "Ill keep you warm" or something sweet like that.|`|wHgBnMipaa	Most likely, that's what it meant.  Lend her your jacket or put your arm around her next time.|`|CIGRQqd7aa	Get a car, most cars are warm.|`|rSXZOU5zaa	Usually she is just trying to get closer to you. Or see if you will let her wear your jacket.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhwZDPgnup9bEUEywpeDxtbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309194515AA1kBpW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|wgu3RoGCaa	ask if she wants your jacket. she might just be making conversation but it can't hurt.  she'll decline politely if she didn't mean that.|`|gtDvPyLKaa	Give her a hug or put your arm around her then ask her is that's better.|`|zu8Tb48Xaa	probably. she's trying to make conversation.|`|GRSidTZZaa	totally agree, you should put your arm around her. or ask if she wants to borrow your jacket if your have one with ya. :)|`|LiE9DdV0aa	u never no. maby she's jus makin small talk<br>  but if u do hug her cus shes cold, dat wood b super cute n she'll love it!|`|AA11296241	offer your jacket - then out your arm around her|`|wYcrYp7Daa	give her ur jacket|`|pglU2CTQaa	Well,, if a girl tells you she's cold you can do 3 things:<br>  * Put your arm around her<br>  * Giver her your coat.<br>  * Ignore her.<br>  <br>  If you really like this girl, put your arm around her, hug her. That's probably what she wants.|`|1ZEYIsPAaa	if you don't have on a jacket, then yes. If you do have on a jacket, give it to her & if she still complains then she wants you!|`|YIJRZhoSaa	Congratulations.<br>  maybe she love you....|`|wjgVgKJvaa	she wants your jacket!! you give her your jacket then wrap your arms around her, if she pulls away then shes retarded, if she kindof snuggles into your shoulder your on a good track!|`|AA10180137	Yes hold her unless she acts uncomfortable! i did that with one of my date's before n all he said was "im cold too"! (he had a sweater n i didnt)|`|huUUzF7Xaa	Either she wants you to hold her, or she's cold....|`|QWevnlTUaa	it means she is cold|`|SrMdpiIMaa	Yes to both.  Give her your jacket, put it around her shoulders and she'll be happy.lol|`|8614e5cdcb37864acc2d04a9b3848058aa	wrap your arms around her and make her warmer.... thats what i would mean|`|IiJH6wF5aa	yes, give her ur jacket
4POGapREaa	Put it on a necklace & don't take it off.  Shower with it, sleep with it, etc.  My husband is like that.  First he broke off one of the prongs in the setting.  How?  I don't know.  Then he lost the diamond & thankfully found it a week later.  You could always just make sure the ring fits very well, doesn't twist around the finger too easily, and make sure the setting is VERY secure.  I'm actually a bit of a klutz as well so my setting is a 6 prong & that diamond isn't going anywhere!!|`|PoVvFeodaa	check this out: I luv baby-c|`|X8C9Zwj9aa	Yes. Have it on a necklace to be safe.<br>  <br>  See source below if you want good designs and quality of rings for you.|`|qoNre4sSaa	Get a cheap copy with zirconium. Explain away the green stains left on the finger.
1WSFNX35aa	I understand how you are feeling.<br>  <br>  My father passed away suddenly and unexpected.<br>  <br>  Everyone grieves differently.<br>  <br>  My emotional wellbeing took on a toll on my physical health. And i couldn’t hold down food for about a week. I probably stayed in bed for that entire week aswell.<br>  <br>  I would suggest to take a week or even a month off work for you to have a chance to have a nice big cry and reflect on yur memories.<br>  <br>  I try and remember all the good things about my dad... like the stories he would tell and bed time and the silly jokes and sayings he would make.<br>  <br>  I began to heal when i realised that my dad is actually in a better place than he was on earth and hopefully if i am a good person i will see him again in the future.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	I know what you are going through. My dad died on March 1, 2007.<br>  <br>  There are stages in dealing with all of this. You first go into shock in spite of the fact that you've known that it was a long time coming, there is denial, there is anger, there is grief and crying, followed by just plain missing her... especially on holidays.<br>  <br>  What was weird, having been on my spiritual path for so long, was that I couldn't grieve for dad because I knew he was set free... it was my own loss I was sad over. I could "hear" dad's running commentary throughout his own funeral (really funny... especially when his b*tchy sister was nattering on about something to me). I had some spiritualist friends talk to him and he really had them cracking up. My friend in another city truly enjoyed his energy and dad had her plumb tickled! My dad (who was a chiropractor) actually gave me an adjustment one evening before the funeral. We go on.<br>  <br>  Just remember that the "leftovers" in that Tupperware coffin are not your mom... she is free. When people go into God's Light, they are restored to the perfected prime of life... gorgeous and healthy. You will feel her presence every so often.|`|o7SnViZBaa	Three years ago my father died from lung cancer after ten months of battling and praying to be healed, then less then one year later my grandmother died of lung cancer in my arms after i had lived with her and taken care of her for three months. I know grief and that is what you are suffering from it will come and go but you have to try and move on. The thought that they were out of pain is what kept me going. Since you lived with her for seven years watching her suffer you know can have at least a little peace knowing that she is out of pain and with her maker whoever that may be. <br>  <br>  I hope that you come to terms with what happened and find a bit of peace. Just know that people do care about what happened.|`|mTNe809Zaa	there is no way to cope you just have let your emotions come when they come.  You'll always have that image in your head but you'll also have all of the good ones.  My dad passed 5 years ago and i'm still coping.  take one day at a time and instead of trying to forget try to accept it for what it is ...something that happened in your life|`|QlXhPFSwaa	you are lucky you were by her side. i was not by my mom's side when she passed away. she was in the USA i was in our home country. we said goodbye on the phone actually i was just talking on the phone i dont even know if she still can hear me. ya i remember i feel nothing. i cried and cried but i feel nothing. really weird. in my case i guess i m lucky that im not used to her by my side anyway. she mostly lives in USA and i live in our home country. so that helps for me.|`|rMOKjYn7aa	I am so sorry for your loss.I lost my mom when I was 18 and can tell you with certainty you will get to the point where you can smile about all the good memories of her.<br>  What helped me a lot was asking myself how mom would want me to feel - and I knew she would want me to work through the loss and live a happy and fulfilled life.<br>  <br>  I don't want points please I simply want to offer what comfort I can to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  I keep checking to see if you have updated and if you are okay? :(<br>  Of course I know this can be a very busy and trying time--just please know my thoughts are with you.
4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	Tell him exactly what you told us. Let him know that you really enjoy hanging out with him, but you want to spend more time alone. If there are things in a relationship that you expect and he can't provide them,  then he's not the one for you. If he can't make time for you, don't make time for him and find someone who will...|`|ggBfHk1waa	Not sure how old your son is, but it seems like you'd probably need a babysitter.  Bring it up that way:  "Hey I found this person who can watch my boy for the evening -or- night -or- weekend where do you want to go?"  (Movie, concert, camping, hotel on the beach, hiking, skiing...)  Another idea is see if your son can stay with a friend's parents and reciprocate the favor.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have a pretty good thing going.  When a guy that age brings a girl around his friends, it's a good sign!  Best of luck to you!|`|LrVzkhl4aa	Bring up some ideas or stuff to do together, and tell him what you want to do this/that night. and at some point make sure he's relaxed and just talk to him about wanting to spend more time just the two of you because its nice, and time alone is needed =)|`|4PdcTUCQaa	How about you take him out somewhere just the two of you?<br>  Damn why do guys always have to do all the work?  Not saying you do everything either but maybe you could show some initiative if its that important to you.<br>  show that you have interest in alone time, maybe give him some action afterward, and he'll put two and two together.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Tell him you want to go out on a date and have regular date nights with just the two of you.<br>  <br>  And it sounds like the honeymoon period is already over -- for one of you, anyway.  If you can't communicate now, might as well move on.|`|KcAehrrKaa	Tell him, " I want to spend time with you, a date, how about it?" Then see what he says.|`|Ict5JA4eaa	i think you should just tell him how you feel. tell him you want just a me and you day|`|t0PzSCs0aa	you should tell him how you are feeling and propose a day of jus the two of you, doing something you enjoy. make it a fun day so that you both have reason to come back.<br>  <br>  if he is non-understanding of your feelings, or unwilling to change, you would be better off looking for a new boyfriend who is more committed to you and is more reliable.|`|AA11296241	how long have you guys been together? also, just tell him you want to have a boyfriend girlfriend time.... if he loves you, he will understand. I am in my late 20is and when i mey my now-hubby we had to work on this part too. maybe next time he wants to come over, send your kid to the baby sitter or a friend - he may get the hint then,... good luck|`|rhvA4G4Paa	talk to him about it.<br>  <br>  just say you dont mind him hanging with his friends at all, but that you'd like to make time for just the two of you to hang out|`|L6MLYMkhaa	Maybe he wants to get away from the kid.  Ask him if the kid is a hinderance.|`|CzIaAnsraa	No! Absolutely not! How dare you!|`|A1mln67Aaa	Tell him just as you explained your question here on Y/A.|`|82f7229d874223ffc501636d6a689c93aa	honestly, you should probably just tell him straight out, or get a babysitter and go to dinner.|`|q84KT11saa	Just be direct.  Tell him that even though you appreciate the time you spend when your son is in bed, it would nice if you both could start setting aside some time for just the two of you out on your own.  <br>  <br>  I recently had that discussion with my husband.  We have two kids and we tend to just spend time together after they go to bed, or we end up going out with friends when we do.  So I simply brought it up and explained to him that Id like to spend time out with just us.  So we make sure we schedule a few dates every month were we can go out alone, together, even if it is just for 2 hours.|`|WttToNwtaa	You need to tell him exactly that...in a nice tone. He will not respond positively to you if you yell (what to him is out of nowhere). He needs time to adjust to what you're saying, but I guarantee that after a couple weeks or so he will WANT to hang out with you rather than his friends. Trust me, you just need to tell him what makes you want to hang out with him in your "alone time." <br>  <br>  best of luck! :)|`|gsrZM0h8aa	Maybe you could bring up some fancy resturaunt you have discovered and tell him that you both should go by yourselves for some fun and alone time.And maybe at the resturaunt (or some other place of your choosing) you could kindly tell him how you feel and maybe ask him if you two could spend some more alone time.<br>  Hope it helps!<br>  =]|`|NYOhKJ3Vaa	I think you should be strait forward with him. If you really like him then this should be easy and comfortable. And if this is not the case you should still tell him. You have some relationship problems to work out. Think about this and the bet way you think this could work out for you and him.<br>                              Good luck<br>                        ~Black Rose<br>  <br>  PS: you should be the one to deside this|`|mQhqRbRQaa	If you really love him, then talk to him.  Because you have to know what you are going into.  You have to be able to know what the person you are about to spend the rest of your life with has in store.  && If you feel that he deoesn't care enough make him care more.  It's easy to do that.  Just stop being overprotective and controlling and he will want to spend more time with you.  Its pure psychology.:)|`|U3tSMBXsaa	Well, you said it yourself. You want to let him know that he's going to have to make time for you two. I'm sure you know this. But a reminder could help: communication is the key to any relationship. Just tell him straight up! Even if that's what you need to say!|`|H5IJrTbqaa	Deary, you need to be honest with him and talk. Talk about everything. How you feel, how do you think he feels about you, everything. Explain that you want time with him. that you love him. Good luck~|`|huUUzF7Xaa	Just tell him how much you love to spend time together, just the two of you. That you love seeing his friends and being with his son but want to hang out with just him sometimes.|`|1Ih7zEQtaa	You should bring it up with him because having an honest, and open relationship with your partner is best for the both of you.|`|8e8c1de13863d142b45216f01c3f9b20aa	Men dont like games or beating around the bush. Just be straight forward about it and be calm when you deliver your message. Then go from there.|`|8rF1cWV5aa	Just tell/ask him. Honesty is everything.|`|0H0HVuwvaa	i agree honesty is everything or just ask him to go to a restraunt with you|`|cz8k7vLhaa	tell him how you truly feel.
cjaphGaoaa	I would be annoyed that he wouldn't let me. He doesn't control me. I can do what I want.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, i would be a bit flattered that he likes me so much natural lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just tell him that its your choice that you want to dye your hair, not his.|`|BUpcsIGfaa	depends where the piercing is but even still its not his body and therefore not his choice and he needs to understand that.  and with the hair dye thing, if you dont like it you can re-dye it :p. but no dont let him take control of the things your allowed to decide for yourself.  good luck !!|`|JBECY23daa	**** he ant your dad and if you asked him if you could that's your bad i mean yea you can ask how it would look but its your hair and your body so i say you do both and if he don`t like it he will get over it and if not then he really didn't`t love you in less he has another reason for you not to do it?|`|QpDNdgQiaa	Of course I'd be mad!!!  It's YOUR body and yes, he does have to be the one to look at you but seriously, I doubt you would do anything to make yourself look stupid, embarassing or ugly!!  He just wants to be able to control you which is pretty sad..maybe he's scared that others will want you or something or he's scared of change. <br>  <br>  But to repeat myself and answer your question...I would be sooo pissed.|`|kiY9kihbaa	He's not just offering his opinion, is he?  What's he threatening to do?  Dump you if you get a piercing or dye your hair?  I think he just told you he doesn't want you to and you are making it sound like he's going to PREVENT you from doing those things.|`|t0PzSCs0aa	i would be mad and tell him either to deal or walk away.<br>  <br>  its your life, your body, your hair. do as you wish. dont live your life for other people. unless he is REALLY worth it. but i leave that thought up to you.|`|IGAx1FgEaa	too controlling, HELL YEAH, i would be mad... break up with him if he can't accept you being happy by changing your looks|`|b5eea40f57d17edc2a9efb9e5f8bc417aa	he sounds like a controlling d*ck|`|wtq7o9t8aa	he loves you the way you are and u should appriciate that. if he wants u to stay the same u should be more then happy to. but if it bugs u that bad u should make him do something (or not do something) in return. but obviously he loves how u look.|`|4bfad7ab1091410a8f457928ef047b92aa	I would be. You are an adult and he is your boyfriend, not your husband so he should not have that much influence on those types of decisions. If he likes it, then he should put a ring on it whoa oh oh!!|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	no i wouldnt be mad|`|gLmVboNkaa	It's the 21st century, your not a slave, he dosnt own you, you can do whatever you want, and if he will make a huge deal out of nothing , then he dosnt love you very much.<br>  <br>  i dont want to sound mean. I was in an abusive relationship before, and thats just what i think|`|HMzUeqTmaa	some men are just over-protective and they dont think you need stuff like that to change. They like the way you were and they think it is a bad way for you to change. MY view on this, just do it anyway to have fun you only live once right?|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Where is your independent mind?  Since when do guys have the privilege to decide what enhances your appreciation of self?<br>  <br>  Why do girls get guys names tattooed for body art?  Hitler had Jews tattooed.|`|gtTg0XOOaa	Yes I would be mad. It's your body, not his. He likes how you look now, and now it's your turn. When you find the right look, I bet he'll agree with you.|`|R0U4qy6haa	and you are letting him tell you what  to do?-why
AA12164862	why are you asking us for? Go for it!|`|BY02DhfWaa	i would think it was all about the sex and it wont last .|`|QbJ04Zqiaa	I always did it the other way around. Seems more natural to me.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	I could care less.  I have more important things in life to worry about!  Go for it.|`|733a18bc9b818b5f9d75e4032cd40880aa	I'd think you must have saw the movie How whats her name got her groove on (smile).

So put yourself in his position and imagine what you would do or feel????|`|vqEaTmU2aa	Who cares what your age difference is? You can make it work and if he's not immature, it shouldn't be a problem.|`|Lj8LpTQ0aa	whatever age is not what matters, it is what it is, THE HEART WANTS WHAT THE HEART WANTS|`|cjcFjW8Daa	BAHAHAHAHAHAHA.<br>  Sorry, the end was funny.<br>  Go for it?<br>  xP|`|hxDD9flkaa	Age difference should have no concern.

3reHk4I1aa	when you block some1 it shows on their aim that you are offline and i like that the best so that way the people you do want to talk to can know that you are online|`|ZcV4zmpxaa	Block will stop them from talking to you. So they will know. Well if you really don't wanna talk to those people just turn invisible. Best solution for you.
vqEaTmU2aa	What reason did she give for breaking up with you? Did she say she only felt comfortable with women, and that no matter how hard she tried, she didn't feel comfortable with you?<br>  <br>  If that's the case, I would guess that she was serious about this relationship and maybe only had that relationship with you because she was not ready to come out to her family (or possibly because she wanted to raise her son with a male role model, I imagine this would be very important).<br>  <br>  Most importantly, I hope you realize that her leaving your relationship for another woman has nothing to do with you - you did not "turn her gay" or something. That's just not how it works.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|bMmV6R2Jaa	Why is everything about you? she has different desires and is trying to fulfil them. . with that paragraph , you could have written a personal ad to find a new girlfriend! THINK ABOUT THAT<br>  www.craigslist.org. women seeking men|`|pvCfwkTJaa	Its not all about you you know...|`|CnywgeNDaa	She may not be a full blown lesbian. She may be bi. Or she may just be bi curious. You never know. She may just be expirementing.|`|gsrZM0h8aa	Well maybe she was bi-sexual the enitre time and you just didn't know it?? Who knows? But maybe it's good she broke up with you before she cheated.|`|4o55RXxwaa	Are you any good in bed because if your not you could have driven her away for something more exciting.|`|tbkNApqvaa	That happened to me once...I'm serious... it was high school im sorry... but my school has a lot of gays the girl i dated was for curiosity... i dunno about u, its probably different tho|`|YQYZR7I0aa	you were boring. spice it up some orgasms|`|Ms9ry27baa	let her be|`|Mt9KMETzaa	probably cause ur 2 inch dick does not satisfy|`|fpXDVT1paa	From one dude to another...<br>  <br>  I think that some girls just find the "P****" more exciting than the other P word...that men have....mhm...<br>  <br>  But you can never really understand women......I personally would suggest, discussing this issue with her parents...get some professional  help......but it's really hard bringing someone back if they've...."switched teams"...|`|sgfGvjs0aa	i don't think that she just "turned" lesbian on you. I think that she was a lesbian all along. It could be 2 things.<br>  One: she knew that she gay and was trying to be accepted by her family and you were just a cover.<br>  Two: She was confused and was probably in her mind denying it, so by dating you she was trying to prove to herself that she wasn't gay.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and i'm sorry you got hurt in all of this, but i guess it's better to know now.|`|ggBfHk1waa	Yeah bummer.  I guess it's better than getting dumped for another guy - even though your friends might tease you. <br>  <br>  Play it cool.  Find some other women to hang out with - there are a bazillion of them.  You might find one you like even more than this one.  Or she might come back to you.  Just don't lose your head and everything will work itself out.<br>  <br>  Best of luck sir!|`|AA12116276	People don't "turn lesbian." Honestly, it sounds like she was trying very hard to be straight and didn't want to accept she likes girls. So she used you as a front or to try to convince herself she could be something she ultimately cannot be. That's how a lot of lesbians end up with kids. Sounds like her family liked you, she knew it and so she kept you around to try to seem straight to her family and make her family happy.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	Dude, shes bisexual.  That's easy enough to figure out.  She didn't "turn lesbian" on you.  Would it hurt less if she left you for some other guy?  Don't take this as a personal affront, like most guys do, it's not about you.|`|R0U4qy6haa	her girlfriend is better at making her happy|`|Kleijp4naa	maybe she was already bi, and you didnt turn her ?|`|3Dfqwodhaa	every ones sexual plesures are different. it is something u r born with but sometimes u just dont relize wut they are until ur old or have had some experience with one gender and u dont feel any sparks. maybe it wuz just curiousity or maybe she is bi. ya never no just give her time.|`|5RUnWnf2aa	Dude, sorry....Bro!   Not your fault - She is either going threw a phase or is trully a lesbian.  More than likely she is going threw a phase, just hold on and be desent to her.  After sometime she may just come back to the other side with all that experience and open mindedness.  You know what I mean!!!|`|8O548lfNaa	your sexuality is not knowledge we are born with. it takes a while for people to discover it, and apparently your girlfriend decided to now. its nothing against you. just how she is. there are others out there. dont worry.|`|QBWiPLVnaa	Just let her be.<br>  For one thing, I don't think she just ' turned lesbian ' on you all of a sudden. Maybe, she was already bi, from the start. But was too afriad to tell you.|`|AA11296241	dont beat yourself down. Its nothign to do with you. She was probably curious like you said.

t0rOQ5FWaa	Well Scotty old boy that knob polishing you got could cost you your marriage so keep quiet|`|aleWoJufaa	Would you feel the same way if your wife found herself in a similar situation?

And, don't blame it on the booze.  You knew it was wrong to see her from the get, and you knew there was a chance something might happen.  Otherwise, you would have brought your wife along.  That being said, if you know there is no chance of a repeat performance and you're feeling truly remorseful, suffer the guilt and never speak of this to your wife.  Doing that would only hurt your marraige and lead her to distrust you forever.|`|iblT1HJpaa	yeah. What she doesn't know won't hurt her........and it's going to eat you alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  And this is the marriage that you want to continue? <br>  WOW!

Remember that she is the half of you and you are the half of her. I am not going to type all the crap you already know deep inside, so I will tell you what I did.<br>  I used to drive cross country- big rig( I am a lady btw) and was on the road a lot.  When I was first on the road, I had a company "trainer" that I road with. For the life of me I cannot tell you what I saw in that man, because he turned out to be a horrible person.<br>  Then came this huge scare. I was pregnant, and I had not told my husband about my indiscretion. It was over a year, but the whole time I was scared chit-less because of the pregnancy!<br>  I knew deep inside that the baby was my husband's, just because of the dates and such, but I kept this horrible secret.<br>  It festered inside of me. It ate at me and my soul.<br>  Every time we found out that someone we knew cheated, he would say,"I am so glad that I can trust my wife, and that she would not hurt my heart like that"<br>  I died inside. Every single time. I died. Because I did, he just didn't know it yet.<br>  So, a year, maybe a bit more passed. I became hateful and hurtful. I said things to try and get him to cheat on me, so I could ease my own soul, we fought and fussed. Finally, I told him..<br>  He looked at me and cried. He cried like his best friend died.<br>  He said, " I live for you, I love you, and you are the mother of my children", all I could do is stand there and look at him in disbelief as he told me these words.<br>  " Do you still love me?" he asked. I told him yes.<br>  Just then, he turned to leave our bedroom, and he said these words that are emblazoned upon my soul..<br>  "I forgive you, I still love you, and you are the love of my life, just give me a few days to come to terms with myself, and then we will talk."<br>  OMG... Never again I thought. God just give me one more chance.<br>  We have now been together for 2o yrs this October.<br>  So, If you are the man you think, and you can face the heartbreak that is there. Your marriage will survive. <br>  But, DO NOT LET HER FIND OUT FROM ANYONE BUT YOU!<br>  Do not disgrace your marriage by pretending that nothing happened, or it was because you had been drinking. If you love your wife, then tell her.<br>  If you feel that you would like to talk more, you can reach out to me|`|wFVsoAGGaa	Cheating is never okay in any situation.  However, keep in mind that adultery begins in the heart, so to even lust after some one is to commit adultery with them already, so you are very much not alone in this.<br>  <br>  As for telling your wife, I honestly don't believe that you are truly concerned about hurting her at this point.  Rather you are concerned with not causing any trouble for yourself.<br>  <br>  Some women would want to know if their husbands cheated on them.  Those who are able to forgive, and those who want to know so that they can have vengeance.<br>  <br>  If you don't tell her and she never finds out and you never do this again, so be it, if you can live with that.  If she finds out form some one else, then that might be a lot worse.  If you tell her and she leaves you, then I suppose that's her choice.  Whatever the outcome, be humble enough to accept any suffering due to this act.<br>  <br>  But remember, we are saved by grace through faith, not from our works.  I'll pray for you.|`|bH1TbhNzaa	Cheating is NOT OKAY in this situation, you and your wife have been together for 10 years, you owe her more than that, you've betrayed her but I don't think you should off load your guilt on her, you've done the crime, you should be the one to suffer with the consequences.  However, I will say this, RESPECT your wife more than this, and if you think you'll do it again, leave your wife you owe her all of you, you shouldn't make her share!|`|hOUEIEmBaa	Ok now that everyone has had there say. You should tell your wife so she will feel terrible and miserable and then possibly think of telling your family as well what a lousy thing you did. Don't stop there you should probably just chop your dick off. That would so much make everyone in here so happy. Really people like your all so innocent and pure. Take a walk in the same shoes and see where you come out at. Dude it sucks and you probably feel like crap, but the best thing to do is get over hopefully it will never surface and love your wife more. If your religeous ask God for forgiveness. There is no need to hurt yourself anymore than what you have done to yourself.|`|nk9m9PmUaa	Never ok. Get ur act 2gthr, make sure it never happens again- (break off all contact w her) keep ur mouth shut save ur wife the pain take this w u 2 the grave. If u cannot, u owe her a divorce. Good luck.|`|MpewkyElaa	POORLY RAISED CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS CAN JUSTIFIY THE SH/T OUT OF ANYTHING. BTW F THIS IS A LIE YOU WERE STILL POORLY RAISED.|`|rupKX1zraa	Women dont understand these things. Keep it quiet and you will be a lot happier.|`|yqkOjhLaaa	Oh....Wow, if you don't tell her then she will find out from some where that is just how life works. I am so sorry|`|EJMwqU3caa	I know this sucks, but cheating is NEVER ok.  I know because I have.  The guilt won't go away until you fess up and ask for forgiveness.  And then the pain of hurting your wife will still be there for a while.  It does get easier.  Takes time.  <br>  Your wife is going to be devistated.  She's going to be angry, pissed, confused, upset, let-down, and more.  You NEED to be there to help her through those days, even if she doesn't want you there.  You need to be willing to go to marriage counseling. You need to allow her to be upset with you, and you need to let her make the next call. Unfortunately, this marriage is really not in your hands anymore.  It's up to her if she wants to continue your relationship.  Your job is to keep letting her know that you still love her and that you still want to be in this marriage.  (unless you do want out)  You also need to place your marriage in God's hands.  He's, ultimately, the only one that can save it.  <br>  And you NEED to stop talking to your college girl -NOW.  Sorry to say those days are over, but if you want to save your marriage, you have to end the friendship with your ex, IMMEDIATELY. <br>  You are going to need a lot of prayers over the next few... well for a quite a while.  <br>  Here are some good read books that might help (they helped me and my husband get through it)  I appologize, I'm horrible with authors names.<br>  1) 10 Traits to a Lasting Marriage<br>  2) Marriage takes More than Love<br>  3) the 5 Love Languages  <br>  <br>  I pray that God places His healing hand on your marriage and restores your love for each other.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

They may have a strong, sometimes unconventional, religious faith. Allied to their taste for all things beautiful is a love for the good things of life pleasure, comfort, luxury and good food and wine and they may have to resist the temptation to over indulgence, leading to drunkenness, gross sensuality, and covetousness.

As long as he is having an orgasm, does it really matter if he ejaculates? In that case, you are still pleasing him so I wouldn't worry about it. <br>  <br>  As for not coming for 3 hours, maybe he is just able to go that long, or he could have a "desensitized" penis (that can happen if you have sex for a long period of time, making it harder to have an orgasm).  It doesn't mean that you aren't pleasing him. <br>  <br>  If you are really that concerned, you could also just ask him if you are pleasing him and find out what you could do to please him more. I would think that he would be honest in that department, as most men would (I know I would).

Auch in vielen vielen Jahren nicht, denn in den alten Zeiten war es so, dass ein Kind konnte immer einem Mann zugeordnet werden, wenn er mit mehreren Frauen geschlafen hat (angenommen er h?tte mehre Frauen, die nur mit ihm geschlafen haben wie es in vielen Kulturen üblich war/ist), w?hrend wenn eine Frau mit mehreren M?nnern geschlafen hat, konnte ihr Kind keinem bestimmten zugeordnet und dementsprechend wurde das Kind als Bastard oder Hurensohn bezeichnet.<br>  Aber für diesen Sachverhalt tragen die Frauen einigerma?en Schuld. Ein Macho, der viel rumgekommen ist, ist bei vielen Damen beliebt. W?hrend ein Bücherwurm z.B., der nicht den Chameur sein kann, der zieht immer die Arschkarte und hat bei euch Ladies oft keine Chance, weil ihr ja so denkt: wenn er mit vielen war, dann muss er bestimmt das gewisse etwas haben, warum diese Frauen sich mit ihm eingelassen haben.

I cried every day and made deals with God that he wisely ignored. In the end my heart had a story to tell and I began to write. I wrote a book and six months later it was accepted by a publisher. My dream since I was a child was to be a published author. Now I am, but it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't been hurt by a man. I hope this helps you. God is looking out for you, whether it feels like it or not. People in your congregation should know better than to judge. Don't judge lest ye be judged, remember? If you need to talk, e-mail me.|`|26bb4bf1a8ae9319e3284cb9b43f607caa	Wow, first let me say that I am sorry. I recently found God and I am divorced too. But your situation has a lot more to it that would confuse anyone. Please know that we all like to focus on God's word like " It's wrong to be divorced" and "now I'm not a true Christian, so whats the point?" but what about " God loves all and has your life planned out" he knows your divorced and that you may question who you are, unfortunately we can't comprehend everything God says because we are humans and we have flaws. But Jesus will take your pain away if you put your trust in him and trust that even through fire he has the best laid plans all set up for you. God has chosen you to help him, to help other people realize that God still loves through divorce, and adultery and Sins that are more common in this day and age. I know this is stuff you already know, but you just need to hear it so you have more perspective of what your purpose was here on earth. Be quiet and listen to your spirit. He won't let you down and remember "all things are glorified through Christ, for those who love the Lord"|`|2be3b8415b279c7208a2abceaf520d3eaa	i can't tell you what you want to hear and i'm sorry if i sound heartless or cruel but i was raised Baptist and i certainly have an issue with women ministers. The bible says that a woman is the mans "helpmeet" and has an important role in all the things he does.But the interpretation is clear that man comes first in worldly duties and woman supports him.That having been said i'll also tell you i've completely lost my faith as to any type of God. To a thinking intelectual (i hope that doesn't sound arrogant) and one who asks questions there is not a possibilty that a God who made us in his image, had anything to do with creation. This is all there is so make the most of it. Do the things you enjoy and eliminate those you don't. Good luck|`|6d678312b5f059fd5c49c429ac571becaa	"He who is imbued with the spirit of of Christ abides in Christ. The blow that is aimed at him falls upon the saviour, who surrounds him with His presence. Whatever comes to him comes from Christ. He has no need to resist evil, for Christ is his defense. Nothing can touch him except by our Lord's permission, and all things that are permitted work together for good to them that love God." (Mount Of Blessing Pg. 71 Ellen White)<br>  God is still in control, He knows what he is doing, rest in Him, talk to him, cry to HIm. Hang in there!|`|d6b8cd209136e52fec57b8b807131d28aa	i have some thoughts.  i too seem to have lost a little faith and it almost seems like i'm mad at God.  I had a miscarriage 2 months ago with my son at 21 weeks.  I was on bedrest for 1 month and we prayed and prayed and even our church prayed for us that our baby would be safe.  needless to say, i miscarried like i said.  yes, i went through a million questions asking him why did he allow this to happen?  i realized how He (God) must have felt when He let His only Son die for every single sin of hours.  How painful could it have been for Him to watch his Son die?  probably more painful than I felt.  and i remember that the bible sais that our children are not ours but Gods.  just remember that god sees more than we can, and he sees the past AND THE FUTURE.  he knows way better than us what is best for us.  if we are trully believers, nothing happens just for nothing.  i know my story had nothing to do with what u went through, but the thought behind it i think it has.|`|4f364ed07507ff78839818b7ffa0e4fdaa	Considering that probably 1/4 to 1/2 of the congregation is divorced, I would hope they would accept a divorced minister.  It would be pretty hypocritical not to.<br>  <br>  If you think of every difficult time in your life, is there any event that you honestly feel you would be better off without having it?  You might think of a terrible injury or illness and think you could do without that, but where would that leave your appreciation for life and health?  You might also think of a time when you hurt someone badly and wish you could undo it, but where would your compassion be then?   The most painful events provide the most valuable experience.<br>  <br>  I don't pretend to know what you are going to get out of this situation but I know it will be better than what you had before.  Faith doesn't demand that God do things for our benefit.  It looks for the benefit in whatever God brings.|`|74eae6a6e35e11b90880b7a3810319b6aa	Do you think a congregation would want a divorced minister?<br>  <br>  Answer: No, too much baggage.

26bb4bf1a8ae9319e3284cb9b43f607caa	Some people worry that if they are honest with a friend, boyfriend or family member, they will be offended and it could put a gap between their relationship. It takes courage and integrity to be honest as long as you can be honest gracefully and tactfully. It is hard to tell someone that maybe a habit or their attitude is annoying. But sometimes people need to be called out if they are being obscene or rude. But think about if it is worth stating or if you could just let it go, it builds patience. Nice question. My last words of advice is, if you are in a relationship sometimes that is the hardest time to be honest.|`|73ce8f792cb8d424715cbd24afd37d9baa	Because you do not feel confident.   don't be a doormat, stand up for yourself!|`|AA10614622	Now's a good time to change that.

AA10293793	here's an idea...<br>  put it in writing. send it to his email, or write to him at home. because he won't actually be talking to you in real time, you won't be right there to see his response or expect a reaction, he will be tempted to read it... maybe curiosity will win out. i'll bet he misses you too, and is just trying to lick his wounds in private. he probably doesn't want to talk to you directly because he is afraid of what you will say. but a letter is different. he can stop reading any time... he doesn't have to worry about someone else seeing him hurt, or about what he might say, it's all between him and a piece of paper, private. he'll be able to read it over and over and make sure he gets it. then he may be more receptive.<br>  then again, he may never open the letter...<br>  and as for you... how can you just believe all this bad stuff about this closest friend, just like that? wasn't there some part of you that thought, "he wouldn't have done that"? when you spoke to him so often, why did you not say, "i heard this on the grapevine, is it true"? what kind of friend were you not to at least give him the benefit of the doubt?<br>  <br>  so he doesn't have email and you don't know his address? you have a phone number, get the phone book out or call information to get an address. if you're afraid his mother will intercept, use a boy's name for a return address. or leave it in his locker, or on his desk, or whatever. quit crying about it and find a way to get it to him. heck, walk up to him in class and put it in his hand. then if he keeps ignoring you, at least you know you tried.|`|c1134ec5d2c099fa09063f46a2c84635aa	Tell me you have the ability to see each other face to face!

Don't be mean but by let him know that way, he can still get out of it with his dignity intact.  Otherwise just tell him straight.  As hard as that it, it's really the best way!|`|cbd1c2dd7554a50c7ffdb81181330844aa	well if your dating just say "this isn't going to work. i'm really really srry, but i'm not ready for this, but i still want to be friends. and if you abandon me as a friend i won't take it the wrong way but don't hate me for this" if it works yea!!!!!!!!1 and if it dosen't and you want to kill me i live with the penguins in antarctica. wink wink nudge nudge.|`|b71821f2dbe2b0650f392388d448cd7caa	you can be friends with someone that is interested in you, keep it just that.

But, if he asks you out, just tell him nicely that you really don't see him like that, even though you think he's totally cool.  He might be upset, but your still young, he'll get over it and you'll be friends.  He'll move on, i promise.

It stems from very low self esteem.  I had things happen in my past that now I can see caused my low self esteem.  <br>  Possibly going to a counselor may help you get passed this feeling.  <br>  Please consider this....Now that I am passed those feelings I feel so much better everyday of my life, I look at things differently.....You deserve to as well!!!|`|7c453c69a2fd3933d0656c03f5488174aa	you're not obsessed with your BF, you have extremely low self esteem.

Once you can learn to love yourself, you can let others love you too.|`|1716780be4ed30fc84fed42480c4186baa	You have low self esteem.

You have to become more secure so that you love yourself, and only then will you trust that your bf really loves you.  At that point, even if he walks out on you, you should still know that you are a worthwhile person in this world.

That's how children develope their sence of a healthy relationship when they are older.  I grew up in a violent home with an alcoholic father.  So it was no suprise that when I grew up that is the kinda person I married.  But I eventually figured out that it wasn't "normal".  But then I met someone wonderful and we try to show our kids a healthy way of life.  I wish people would step back and think about what their kids see.  It's so important to show love!|`|AA10012524	parents serve as role models for their kids...when they grow up they end up in a relationship that resembles their parents|`|6420ae324368ce78816c15a606a85c15aa	Children repeat what they hear and see.  Parents are role models for children's future.  A father teaches his son what kind of man to be in the future.  A father teaches his daughter what kind of man to marry or what kind of man won't marry her but use her.  A father teaches his daughter to be respected or abused, depending on the type of person he is.  He teaches his son to respect women or abuse them.<br>  <br>  A mother teaches her son what kind of woman to marry or what kind of woman to have a casual relationship with.  A mother teaches her daughter what kind of woman to become.<br>  <br>  We gravitate toward what we are used to.  It is just like if we speak English and go to a country that doesn't speak English we would feel left out.  The moment we hear someone speaking English we will go in their direction.<br>  <br>  Parents teach us the language of our future.  It is very important for parents to show and exercise unconditional love.  Abused people abuse people.  <br>  <br>  It is possible to change from what we were taught by our parents but it is very hard.|`|AA10198960	i dont know what part of the equation you are, but if your one of the parents who doenst like the other [divorced?] dont talk bad about the other.  it just makes the kid confused and lost.  it really just is [important].<br>  <br>  dont fight infront of them, act like you get along.<br>  its just better for the kid to beleive everythings functional<br>  otherwise they might grow up blaming themselves.<br>  <br>  you can ask me through one of my questions i guess<br>  w/more specifics<br>  im not sure where you are in this<br>  but its really hard when yoru parents dont get along.<br>  <br>  the first answer is true too<br>  actually both are.|`|c42ff3c4283b86d91c4bb1b58b0d6563aa	It really depends on if the child lives in the house with both parents... If so then... Children know alot more than we think they do and I know this because when I was 7 my parents got a divorce and I had alot of questions unaswered but I understood. If the parents don't talk and a parent is absent in a child's life then the child is going to thin k something is wrong with them because they only have one parent.

But it needs treating, I'm afraid. Untreated, it has a huge (20-25%) suicide risk.<br>  <br>  Sadly, unless he's so manic that he gets taken to the ER, or so depressed he attempts suicide, it's very difficult to get the medical system involved.

Heelp your b/f learn all he can about his dad's illness and support him if he wants to go for diagnosis.  Also, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is a great resource.  Their number is 1-800 950-6264.  Good Luck!

You should just tell her how you feel and tell her you need to know if she wants to continue the relationship or not because you can't keep worrying about it all the time.|`|356272fb63c71144f012d0e2a36abcacaa	she might be intrested in someone else and she maybe she wants you to break up with her so she can persue someone else or maybe you are just too patient and she needs a reality check

I was in a similar situation, where I wasn't returning calls to the guy that like me only because I wasn't sure if I liked him or not, and needed space and time to decied if I want more to come from us. Well I decied finally that I do now want more, so I'm sure to always answer when he calls, I do nice things for him during the week (like bring his supper) and ask him to do things with me, like hang out and such. So, hopefully she just needs time to decied if she's ready to be in another relationship. Hope it works out!!!!|`|AA11504982	Ask her why she's only into the physical.

Honestly, I would laugh at you, I would find you real silly. However, not humored for long, I would want you out of my face and maybe even feel threatened. I am not sure what would happen if I felt threatened. I appreciate your honesty, and must say I found great humor in it. However, you cannot go around asking females about their feet. This behavior by some may be perceived as annoying or even threatening.  My suggestion is that you stop seeking out the female with the prefect feet and ask God to send her. Or do your female companion searching in the summer time, when females with the pretty feet have sandals on. Good luck to you and God bless

Women have babies therefore nothing will hurt more compared to child birth so believe me, you will get over this guy and the next and the next even if it does hurt.

(been there, done tat) it's our sense of insecurity tat makes us feel tat our bf is cheatin on us.... <br>  <br>  it's still best for u to gather more facts abt this.. don't juz jump into the well without checkin if there's water in it or not :)|`|e7dc5df210cf3912f6da13650794c351aa	well...u didnt really give a lot of information on why u think he's cheating on you....so i cant help as much as I'd like. But heres what i can say. If you have a reason to believe that your boyfriend is cheating on you after you've been together for 6 years then there's something not just wrong with him, but with the two of you. The whole relationship, I mean. Obviously you two arent as close or dont share that same connection like you used to. Tell him about it. Tell him that you're starting to feel weird about the certain things he does, and see what he says and where it goes from there. Warning: Don't just blow off on him when you cant take it anymore and say "You're cheating!" That won't turn out well at all, you have to be civilized and talk to him about his actions before you start accusing|`|f1610b5c6d41e08cfe3e613afb2f3a0aaa	There are ways!!!

(That shouldn't break the bank either, a 14 karat gold pair can be about $20 at a department store, depending on how fancy you want to get.) Maybe get ones with her birth stone?

I will give you one of mine.  In the beginning of my relationship with the man I am currently dating, I would notice that his female co-workers would pretend I didn't exist and would be affectionate with him in front of me.  When confronted he would just say they were good friends.  One day, while visiting him for lunch, he stepped out of his office for a moment.  Just at that moment, an e-mail from one of his co-workers popped up on the screen.  What I read just blew my mind.  It turned out that he was having explicit conversations with his co-workers that I found to be very inappropriate.  I eventually checked his history, got his password and 3 years later will still check to see if everything is on the down-low.  So far so good.  He had lied to me and I think checking for reassurance is better than not knowing.|`|e344be19a97e8d4ef2115db3e573ddc1aa	Been there done that, caused all kinds of grief in my relationship and I'm 37!!!!!  It made me not trust him.  You can't know everything about a person 100%.  People are going to do things wrong (we're human) but... if he is not into you, you will know, without spying on him.  If he's trying to meet other people for dating, just drop him now and save yourself the heartache.  There's so much trash on myspace.  I caught mine sending an e-mail at 4 in the morning to an 18 year old telling her she had a nice ***.  (this was during an 3 week break up during the summer which he decided on) She had her underpants pulled down while she was bent over.  The internet is all fantasy and while you can meet people from on line sooner or later their true colors will shine through.  No matter how good looking, how cute their "***" is they aren't without faults and problems just like the rest of us.  So... if your man is on myspace let it fly even though you may not like it that he is on there, he is going to do whatever he wants, you don't get to control him, you only get to control you.  Besides.... would you want him to be able to go into your stuff without your knowledge?  We all have our little secrets.  If you are looking that hard you are always going to find one little thing that is going to bother you.  Trust me I know.  Keep in mind he is your boyfriend.  He did choose to be with you.

Use foods that you like, (snacks) use ice and see if that helps to spice up the situation.  You have to stop being scared and do everything that you know how in order to keep your man happy and satisfied.  If not then he will eventually venture out and find his satisfaction somewhere else and with someone else.  Do what you do.

b70726a65f169615c729e80eae13716aaa	Hello:<br>  <br>  I know how hard it is to still love someone but know that you can't be with them. An ex-boyfriend and I were so much in love, but our relationship failed when he cheated on me in attempts to make me jealous. Afterwards I was so hurt, and even though he told me it didn't mean anything that he was just trying to make me jealous, I had to end the relationship. <br>  <br>  For a long time I was so incredibly sad. He would call me, and I would have to not answer the phone because I knew he was calling to try to get me back, and I knew that when I heard his voice that I would invite him over just to be with him. <br>  <br>  After time I was able to talk to him and remind him that we couldn't be together. And finally the feelings I had for him slowly went away.<br>  <br>  I know it's so hard to want to be with someone in your heart, but know in your head that it's not something you should do. But hang in there, it will get better. <br>  <br>  Proof? I'm in a new relationship and I'm much happier than I was before. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and good luck!|`|8a6a2246bd97c589b9aece1b1371c066aa	insecure.you would rather be a couple than alone you should learn to love yourself a bit more then you wouldnt have so much doubt|`|AA10375363	cuz u miss the freindship|`|de80830fc285f1be6d071e2cc102cbd3aa	Sometimes I feel the same way.

Therefore able to move on healthy and strong. Just like you ,you understand and have peace for what it is. You are very healthy and strong and in time, you will go on a new path. You know that you love her and that is  just what it is, that will never change. Its not about her. <br>  I say enjoy the feeling.

Will it give other girls the wrong impression and scare them away because I'm hung up on this girl who obviously doesn't like me?  Does this not make me look like an obsessive stalker?"<br>  <br>  I've been in this situation before, way back in my much younger years.  Looking back at myself I cannot believe I was so stupid to make myself blind to the beauty of the world around me, and all the opportunities I denied myself because I was hung up on a girl that had basically thrashed my heart to smithereens.<br>  <br>  What you have is a dangerous obsession.  You better move on, for your own personal mental balance.  You may think your being interested in this girl does not affect your job performance or your life, but it is very clear to me that it does.  Move on, kid.  Take it from somenoe who has been there, done that, got the t-shirt and washed it many times.
72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	When your a teenager you'll definitely do this. I know I did when I was a teenager. I only had one boyfriend my parents really didn't like, and I wish I would have listened to them when they were trying to warn me about him. He turned out to be a very abusive guy. Sometimes parents see what we don't see and are just looking out for you. At other times they just simply might not like the guy and he could really be a cool guy. Just make sure this guy is respecting you above anything else.|`|a79139453608aa82e6d6301bedc0b9eaaa	If your parents gave you some reasons why they don't want you with him,  talk to them calmly about the reasons.

Your parents will have a say in this if you live under their roof. Not going out with a boy doesn't mean that you can't have a boyfriend. It can be hard, but your parents know what the best is for you. It's mostly like they'd be right. If he is a good guy, he'd totally understand. You will have many years of dating experience ahead of you. So don't worry!|`|9d5612ccab709c04158dae2851de6d4daa	Of course! How do you think YOU got here?<br>  <br>  There's truth to that too.

A man will treat you the way he treats his mother!!  Trust me.  I wish I would have listened to my parents when I was only 16.  They told me to break up with my boyfriend and I never did.  I thought they were just trying to be controlling and mean.  I married this man and I've been sick and miserable since.  Now that I have 3 kids by him and he's mentally abusing the girls now, I'm getting a divorce after 15 yrs of marriage.  Your parents have good reason to tell you NO.  Pray about the matter.  Give other guys a chance.  Don't have sex until you are married.
75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	OK, if you're bipolar, you need treatment. It's very simple. But first, you need to understand something about bipolar. See if you recognise any of this.<br>  <br>  OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.<br>  <br>  It is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_dia...</a> ). The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.<br>  <br>  The cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.<br>  <br>  There are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. These drugs are heavy duty psychiatric medications and are not to be taken lightly, and most if not all of them have a range of side effects including lethargy, photosensitivity, cognitive impairment (dumb as a box of rocks), weight gain, hormone problems, hair loss and blood problems. These side effects have to be wieghed against the benefits of mood stabilisation. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.|`|553ceca339ed1bf71becf1f3a2e59cf0aa	I'd say you're bipolar just from reading your question. I'd suggest getting help or seeing someone. I think it's totally rude that you're pboyfriend is ignoring your calls but maybe he's just trying to make it a point that  he's had enough of your shyt and wants you to get help. Take the hint and do it if you really care about this man. Otherwise he's never gonna be with you. Although with bipolar disorder you can collect SSI and other forms of governement pay to take care of yourself. I wish I was bipolar. Cheese is really good. Maybe I am bipolar.|`|e296cb5f4f7bf1485d463fbddd5c6c0aaa	you're probably not bipolar, and he has no right to call you anything unless a doctor diagnoses you as a bipolar person.  your ex is overreacting about what are probably hormonal mood swings from the pregnancy.  i know that it's hard, but if he is so heartless not to want to deal with you then he's not worth your time.  move on and find new joy in the birth of your child.  maybe you two can be friends.|`|e4c8466cecc30710e2887850a549c3b5aa	Ok... before I answer your question..  Please, I know you're hurting and stressed and frustrated..  but next time try to type out a grammatically correct question.  It's extremely difficult to read your question.  <br>  <br>  As far as your question about being bi-polar.  I would not be scared to see someone.  In fact, the first person you should speak to is your doctor for your pregnancy.  At a minimum, they will be able to send you in the proper direction.  <br>  Being pregnant, and having "mental issues" is normal for some people.  Everything is changing in your body right now, and it's possible that it's just you're pregnancy that's causing you to seem "crazy".  The real question is.... were you having problems with "bi-polar" before you got pregnant?  if you were, there is a possibility you could have some sort of issues..  that may or may not be "bi polar".  <br>  There are alot of other things that could be going on in your head...that only a professional can explain to you after discussing things with you.  <br>  On another note, and I'm only about 90% sure about this, again you'd have to check.  If you are bi-polar, manic depressive, depressed, have social anxiety disorder, or any other mental issue that requires you to be on medication... it is very unlikely that a doctor will prescribe anything for you until AFTER the baby is born.  If the doctor DOES prescribe something like Prozac...it'd be wise to obtain a second opinion, and discuss the effects of this drug on your unborn child with a pharmacist.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1af82f4322fb6009f2617a2dd40da4dcaa	why your scared to go for help?|`|6128169f0370b04ccf185e10c7a2a05caa	I wouldnt go see the person for him.

You didn't mess with any of his friends, did you?|`|60ce8f60a6d48ea42d2befc702df0e3faa	I would like to know as well:)|`|7fdc17a30fa0581b54228179fdac13dfaa	if he likes you and misses you, he should flirt with You, not your best friend.|`|AA10375363	i dont think soo,,that wouldnt be my impression,,i think u should keep ur ex,as an ex
AA10823917	i think when your are in one of moments where your holding her hand then you should tell her how you feel and good being with her makes you feel and if she would like to take ther realationship further to see what develops down the road. make sure you do it romanticly and im sure she will be putty in your hands. good luck.|`|1af82f4322fb6009f2617a2dd40da4dcaa	maybe to her a relationship does not start untill you kiss.|`|321d5e2da2cd6bd10a0f864e974bbefeaa	You should just ask her where she thinks you two are. Personally, I think a relationship takes longer than 2 nights of holding hands to establish. However, it's more important what you and your girl think.|`|AA10532628	maybe you should ask her out... i think.|`|a1798482bc54047803302918b286e545aa	just ask her|`|f25d781fecfc51036e22dd327944d175aa	no...you must ask her out if you want her to acknowledge a relationship. you cannot assume anything just cause ya'll "hooked up."  that's why you need to communicate and make it clear to each other so no one will get hurt (if your hooking up for fun).  tell her that you like her a lot and want to know if she wants to go out with you.  there.....its not that hard!!!!
41f6ce9d315a8c72789e8f89caa14eebaa	first and foremost relax, dont let things get tyo too nervous to freakout when the time comes. yes i am a guy but i have seen these same situations first hand. if she is experianced with it all. just kick back and let her take control. just melow out and go with the flow, at your own pace ofcourse. after she hasyou comfortable then your natral instincs will kick in and then you will thuroughly enjoy yourself|`|a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	just tell her so, she might liek the idea of "teachin" you|`|23aa989ddecda6b1155d6421fa700be3aa	You don't have sex with a GIRL because you like her.  Wait until you love her and marry her!  Then you won't have to ask what to do, you will just know!|`|62b4aaa7ad180789afe41b3d4a6ba496aa	cook a steak on the gril LOL
3f842c862393900d47437e347ba3138caa	Alrighty, well, I'm gonna be the optimist in the bunch. I think they can work out, but it takes a lot of work. Stats show that a person in a long distance relationship isn't any more likely to cheat then a person in a regular relationship, however, people involved in LDR's tend to feel more disconnected from their partner, as they aren't able to be a part of their day to day, everyday activities. So although you two may have great communication about your feelings for one another, it can otherwise be difficult to maintain a sense of closeness. The best thing to do is talk your partner on a regular basis. Throughout the week jot down little points of interesting things that happened to you that day so that you can remember to tell your partner about them when you talk to them later on. Sometimes they work out, sometimes they don't, but if you're in one, and you want it to work, just remember that communication is key. If you both love each other and are willing to put in the work, I'm sure you'll be fine! (speaking from my current experience, it's hard though.. if I could not be in one that would be great, but I'd much rather deal with the distance and have him to go home to then to spend my life without him. Just a year and a half to go before we don't have to be apart anymore... and counting! :). Good luck to you!|`|2337980c9d6dd6132744491a4d51b67caa	Rarely does it work out.  Out of sight, out of mind.

86f7ab59281183299a346c9bfa75a03eaa	Tell him that she's been sensing that he has feelings for her, but she doesn't really see him like that. She sees him more as a friend. Now, if she doesn't see him as a friend, she should still say that, but turn down all of his offers. The first time, be gracious, saying "I'm not free that day," but don't suggest a different day. The next two times, say the same thing, but reject each idea. If he's still askinga fifth time, she should say "I'm really busy this week/month/year/decade. You know what? If something frees up, I'll call you."<br>  <br>  If he doesn't figure it out by then, she should just say exactly how she feels--"I don't think we have anything in common. I don't have any free time to spend with you, and I would appreciate it if you cease calling.|`|AA11135379	omgsh that just creepy|`|22e5d89caae249630b7dee09662fc48baa	Set him straight she can't go around forever pretending to like him.

If so you need to seriously work on getting happy with yourself fixing things you arent happy with etc and then others will see that you are a great person. If someone doesnt like you? Who cares.

078da3c0ce65feea6aa34600dbdef1abaa	Guys, generally don't do alto of calling unless they specifically want something or have something to say. Besides, that relationships have a tendency to get into rhythms and it looks like your "phone rhythm" starts out with you calling. <br>  <br>  I'm curious why, if you've been together for 3 years, you can't have a honest conversation with him about this that leaves you feeling good about the answer he gives.  Maybe, overall communication is a problem with you guys.  I think you should talk about talking more freely and honestly with each other.|`|0a71d76dfa1ab1ac5d93f86e92f2f955aa	Ask him.

1a9f3918ea308908989dbc2f70ce2af2aa	I have had similar relationships.  I'm 23 years old now and it just seems that younger guys are not really mature enough to truly understand the need for change to make a relationship work.  Love doesnt come easily, I mean its a meshing of two different people and that takes a lot of compromising and understanding.  I'm sure he wants to change but imagine trying to change things about yourself that have been your nature for the past 20 years or so.  Those things likely can't be changed in a day or in a week or a month and if they are things that are serious (things that either really hurt you when they happen or things that you simply can't accept) then you should take some time away from him or move on.  At least that way he'll know how serious you really are.  And as far as the parents thing goes, I've had that too.  If you are close with your parents its going to be really hard to have a boyfriend that they hate and visa versa.  You end up being caught in the middle being made to feel badly by both sides.  Its rough.  You sound young so from my exerience, its really hard to let a love go however over time you start to see that life shouldnt be filled with stress and anger and drama and feelings of sadness, jealousy or hurt.  Hope you can find the strength to do what's best for you.

AA11127444	Answer is in your question only. <br>  <br>  What do you prefer? An honest man or one keeping secrets and playing mysterious? <br>  <br>  I want her to share everything to me, to be as one, to trust her not only with my life but with my soul also.

de4f08d88c9e2f767b955d414c6b1496aa	They need to get along for your sake. He needs to suck it up, no matter how upset he is, and at least be civil with your parents. They are your FAMILY and he can't ask you to give them up. He needs to be able to do that for you or he doesn't really care about you.  They didn't include him in the deal because he isn't their family, YOU ARE.  That is really nothing for him to be upset about.  Your parents are just trying to look out for you.  If he is going to make you choose...choose them.  As far as his daughter...she is a kid...she is only listening to people bad mouthing them.   If she hears nice things, she will think nice things about them.   This is all really within your control, you just HAVE TO put your foot down!   <br>   Good Luck!|`|e2dcbbd06c328fca5f6dc4de8395aaa8aa	Your mom is the one in the wrong.......Reading your question woke me up about my mom and my husband......MY Husband is in the right.  <br>   <br>  I have a good husband, my mom doesn't have one and she lives her life through me.

I believe in standing behind your husband but just a boyfriend not so much. If he were your husband this would be a different story, I would say stand behind him. Your family probably doesn't think of him as part of the family because look he hasn't even made their daughter an honest woman.|`|AA12071742	You have to make that decision, because boyfriends come and go, but your parents will always be your parents.  If your boyfriend does not understand that, then he is not worth it.  How would he feel if you felt the same way about his parents.  I think he is being selfish and only thinks about him.  What happened to the love he said he had for you?

A person could be wearing the same shirt two days in a row (it's gross, yes) but if they have that right amount of confidence - it's very attractive and sexy. As far as specific looks and personalities, people will always have their own and different prefrences - some guys will like high maintinence girls, some like them simple. Some girls will like the "prince charming" guy and some will like the bad boy rocker type. But i think "confidence" is the general thing that both men and women find sexy :)

qGVGhydtaa	Monogamy is as natural as matrimony and living in houses.  Natural implies that it is what would happen in a more primative setting.  Sex is natural the number of partners you have is not determined by nature.

I am not really sure about this.|`|4815d55767acda3385a0b36bab8a48f1aa	Natural no. Monogamy is something you choose to do. Men like sex and naturally could care less who it comes from. Men are like dogs they will hump anything to get off.|`|5220fb282f3dd60a5e418afe0117236caa	I believe in it.  However I truly believe it has to do with your morals, standards and trust in a person.|`|b9b1a38bedc4c04ad462d6f93b292300aa	It is certainly not. Our basic instincts drive us to have sex with multiple partners. Our current society now values picking a mate and being monogamous for our lifetimes but this is a struggle because it is not natural. In addition if you think about sex strictly in the sense of survival of the whole it is better for a man or woman to have children by multiple partners. This provides decreased chance of all of ones children dieing because of a bad genetic pairing. We have created a very complex society with lot of rules and benefits but if you take "natural" to mean  that if all the artificial rules and benefits of our society were striped away what do you have left then the answer is definitely no.|`|AA11145843	Natural or not, it has worked for the greater part of humanity for thousands of years.  If nature intended for men to have many wives, then there would be that proportion more female births than male. In other words, if six times more girls were born than boys we could assume that each man was intended to have six wives. That doesn't happen.|`|AA10858602	No, it is not natural, and it's not practiced among all cultures.  But you can't use that as an excuse for divorce.  We are human, intelligent creatures, we use our brain and don't have to live off of instinct.  We can reason and know right from wrong.

Then your ex can't use them bacause it would be a conflict of interest.  Then you can just get a good one that won't cost a fortune and your ex will have to do the same thing.

People should really try for the children/s sake as well as financially to be civil and make mutual decisions instead of having to go through the court.|`|31f1fb57650b4c45ad8dcdc225f90008aa	It just depends on how much fighting there is and really who has the better chance. If you think there is a good chance the other one can win. You will be spending a lot of money. I spent about 8000.00 and that was 15 years ago. I would spend it again in a heart beat for the welfare of my kids.|`|4815d55767acda3385a0b36bab8a48f1aa	uncontested probably around 1000.00 to 1500.00 if contested your looking at 2000.00 and up depending on what all is involved.|`|tf1UcywCaa	Most generally a custody case will cost you about $10,000 minimum and that is on top of the retainer that you have to pay your attorney.  Custody battles aren't cheap and there is no guarantee that you will win the battle.  Good luck to you.

Efr3KdzMaa	I am in one of these myself, so maybe I can help. Get a cell phone plan with a lot of minutes.The phone is going to be your main link for communication, your lifeline. You will have to depend on it a lot to make this relationship work. You have to talk, on the phone, everyday at least once, if not more. When schedules have been established, choose a set time to call and talk. If you can, try and have the same cellular service because a lot of companies offer free mobile to mobile minutes. Talking is the main thing. Text messages are also nice ways to send little notes throughout the day so you are always in the back of their mind. Next, you are going to have to have a lot of faith in your mate and trust him/her. Also, try and coordinate schedules for visits whenever you can if this is possible. TRUST TRUST TRUST is the main thing. Established trust carries a relationship far, without it, you have nothing. Try not to let petty jealousies creep up. If he/she is out with friends, encourage it. After all, they are with you and love you and wouldnt go through all the trouble of a long distance relationship if you didnt mean everything to them...|`|c5cd0335ee42a5ea6e90bf0c236232e4aa	most importantly remember, never listen to anyone about what your partner is upto, honesty, and most of all trust. if u trust your partner then wherever they are trust them to be fiathful to u, and if they at sometime r uncontactable dont let stupid thoughts get the better of u, they r with u and they love u, we all need some companionship at times so they could be out with friends having some innocent fun, like u would and because u r unfaithful then u would suspect the same from your partner, so remember trust...
Bo0nDS7saa	yes|`|AA11595174	I guess he wants her to be his gf...but at the same time he is not sure if that girl is really into him or playing with his feelings cos she likes the other guy too.

It sounds like it got very hard for the guy to sit on the sidelines when the girl was really interested in someone else, and didn't have room for him too.|`|a0078de127c8ac0c1e728e8421adc006aa	wahahahhahaHH!!!<br>  <br>  no!
QsaPKrLfaa	Girl, you need to slam that door shut! He is the one who left you without even hearing what you had to say. If he really loved you he would have asked you about the rumors before just going off on you and then dumping you! As for his iming you, you need to put him on your blocked list. If he truely wanted you back he would not be nice one minute and freaking out the next and he would have called you or stopped by your house with an I'm sorry! It's time for you to move on and find a guy who trusts you and loves you for who you are not for what the rumor-mill says you are.

You should never do anything that makes you uncomfortable in order to please anyone!<br>  <br>  Next time he brings it up, say politely but firmly "I don't like talking about this. Please don't bring it up with me again." If he respects you at all, he will have no problem with this request. If he pitches a fit of any kind, ditch him. He will have made it entirely clear what he values (i.e. talking about sex over your comfort and happiness) and is not worthy of you.

Cd5avmhWaa	I don't think you'd be a traitor to your friend, cause if she hasn't told you that she likes him back then she probably doesn't. Gettin him to notice you isn't really that hard if your wild and outgoing and like to have fun, but if you are shy and quiet than it can definately be more difficulut. If you really like him go up to him and try to start a simple conversation with him, become friends, he may end up liking you back, a simple "hi" is a good way to start. But even if he doesn't end up liking you back I would suggest just moving on.|`|AA10485000	Well, it seems he is either playing hard to get or really isn't interested in you.  As far as the friend goes, well I would be careful about trying to persue him especially if she likes him.  What is more important?  A friendship or him?  You have to decide if you are willing to lose a friend over him.
Li2eVQ5Baa	wow..thats really hard to do....i think its just as hard to break up with somebody that u were with for that long as much as it is for the person thats going to be dumped....(well maybe slightly more for the dumpee)....okay well heres my opinion: you need to talk to her, be completely honest about your feelings and why you want to end your relationship...listen to her reaction and hear her side of the story and how she feels....(even if its something you dont want to hear..u still need to let the girl speak)...this is the hard part..finding the words to tell her its over..itll probably feel like a big ball in your throat..but once you get it out..itll all flow from there....be a gentleman and offer to remain close friends....with time everything heals..and what hurts in life can only make one stronger so you both will be fine in the long run...i hope i helped ya..good luck ull be okay|`|389b3a27bf29c0bc12a7065dd9dc2f3baa	You will need some form of closure, <br>  then just smile and say goodbye<br>  After the door is locked and you're alone<br>  Don't forget to have a good cry! <br>  <br>  The next thing to do is to start again<br>  to meet some new friends and love anew,<br>  To sit home alone and cry your life away<br>  Is just something you should not do! <br>  <br>  Let your heart heal and then make room<br>  for someone who will love you in return...<br>  If you will do this simple step towards new love<br>  You'll find someone new  for whom your heart will yearn|`|HXVN8CgZaa	Allow yourself to grieve, because it is very hard to let go.  Letting go completely will help, because you will always feel that pull like a powerful magnet every time you see or talk to them.  Then open yourself to the idea that you can love someone else like that, too.  But give yourself time...your new s.o. will deserve someone who has no leftover emotional baggage and can start fresh.|`|HbKshrObaa	You just try and let time heal you.  WIthout knowing why you have to let go of them, its hard to say anything more.|`|Qe5C5UsBaa	Honestly you will never fully let go but you can surround yourself around people whom you trust to help you get through the difficult time ahead of you. Never allow yourself to be alone. Just call up a friend and go hang out with people who will lift your spirts.|`|akZ5pS1aaa	Sorry for your loss, Tony. Realize that it will get better, you won't hurt like this forever - take it day by day. Believe that it will work out for you in the end - maybe in a way you can't see right now, but someday you'll benefit. Don't focus on the negative so much, and try to be around positive, happy people who care about you and appreciate you. There will be another special person in your life, sometime, and in the meantime try to stay positive. Work on yourself and your feelings; don't dwell on the loss or the other person.|`|Cd5avmhWaa	it can be hard, and it may take a while, try to go out for coffee or something and meet someone nice that you may be interested in forming a relationship with.

You will make mistakes as life goes on and they will often be the most interesting parts of your life.

But if you don't do this then you will you regret it. at least give it a go and then if you don't like it then you always have home. I hope this has helped you. if you need someone to talk to more just email me. i am always willing to help people and make new friends.

zvDXhj3Uaa	Flat out tell him you like him.... Just say it, its not bad too. then he can make up his mind :)|`|AA11825912	I would ask him straight out what his intentions are.  Because you said he's "just about to get together with her".  I'm not sure what that means, but 3 hour phone calls would tick me off if I were her.  He's spending all this time with you, but getting into a relationship with her? Sounds like he wasn't prepared for you to come along and now maybe he's not sure what he's supposed to do.  Don't push him, but don't be his "girl on the side" either.  Ask him and then let him make up his own mind.  And whatever decision he makes, if he chooses her, then let him go and live with his choice.   Good luck.|`|N1dN7Dj8aa	the answer to the question can be yes and no. it just really depends on the guy and what he feels for you. if i were you i would just ask him like what exactly does he feel for you or ask him if he and that girl are going out yet i mean those are just giving him clues but its not like you are asking him flat out either just go ahead and give it a chance and see what he responds. Good Luck!|`|vQMLWdlfaa	Probably not.  He is probably being just a really good friend to you and may be attracted to you but doesn't want to ruin that rare friendship that you got.  Cherish your friendship but don't push it any farther.  If it is meant to be, then it will just happen.
GLBQQWYnaa	He likes you. I am pretty sure.

4b1793ae8f5d11a4cdc73472ea176cabaa	Cuando el intercambio es frecuente, los sistemas de trueque encuentran rápidamente la necesidad de tener algún bien con propiedades monetarias. Esto facilita mucho el comercio y la permanencia de las familias en la zona, favoreciendo la riqueza del lugar y el crecimiento demográfico dando lugar al natural proceso del libre comercio y evolución de la economía.<br>  <br>  Para ello, distintas civilizaciones han adoptado distintos bienes como dinero (oro, plata, otros metales o minerales, trigo, en China se crearon tabletas de té, etc.).<br>  <br>  En la historia occidental, la primera manifestación histórica que conocemos del dinero en forma de moneda fue inventada por los fenicios.<br>  <br>  El dinero en esa fase tiene un valor intrínseco. El oro o la plata en sí tienen un valor, y por eso se intercambia. Sin embargo, hoy en día el dinero solo tiene valor como instrumento de intercambio (el papel del que está compuesto un billete no tiene valor). Para ello, fue necesaria una evolución en la cual los Estados emitían billetes y monedas que daban derecho a su portador a intercambiarlos por oro de las reservas del país.<br>  <br>  Más adelante, se fue progresivamente eliminando esa medida, y el principal motivo por el cual el dinero que hoy usamos tiene un valor es la creencia en la certeza de que será aceptado por los demás habitantes de un país como forma de intercambio.

Elimino las complejidades del canje de productos que se hacian antiguamente, sirve como acumulacion para fines de placer diferido, y permite proyecciones virtuales a larguisimos plazos, para la concrecion de todo tipo de objetivos. Por dar un solo ejemplo, en Japon las propiedades se compran a pagar en ..........90-100 a?os !!!!!!!!!.......tal cual, la pagan varias generaciones. Si no existiera, que harian ? pagarian con gallinas ? como calculas los huevos que pondran en 100 a?os ? y si el gallo es afeminado y no hace su trabajo ? se te atrasa el pago, tenes intereses, te rematan la hipoteca, es un lio, mejor usa el dinero, que es mas facil, mas chiquito para maniobrar, etc.|`|ptRpoC0yaa	Primero que  "el diablo" es un producto de la interpretación literal  y no simbólica de las sagradas escrituras.<br>  Segundo, "el diablo" en realidad es nuestro orgullo y para vencerlo hay que practicara diariamente las virtudes divinas<br>  Tercero: "El diablo" es también una buena rasan para controlar las masas que carecen  educación.<br>  Cuarto: Si "el diablo" invento el dinero, entonces también invento el cuchillo, las drogas, la guerra, la soga, los venenos...<br>  Quinto: Si hasta ahora no lo  figuraste, entonces piensa que los objetos inventados no son malos o buenos. Lo que es muy importante es el uso que las personas dan a los objetos.<br>  sexto: El dinero fue inventado para facilitar las compras. Hasta ese momento la gente usaba el cambio de objetos por objetos, o servicio. Un ejemplo, cuando vas al medico ya no tienes que llevarle gallinas o un cesto con frutas. El dinero permitió tener ahorros y el uso del crédito. Recuerda, todo depende como usas el dinero.

7XggNAbqaa	I love the way he supports me in everything that I do.  I love how he always tells me how smart and educated I am.  I love how he tells me that I'm a great Mom to our three kids.  I love the way he cries sometimes when we watch sad movies and isn't ashamed to cry those tears in front of me.  I love the way he puts his hand on the small of my back and leads me in to a room.  I love the way he snuggles up to me on the couch late at night after the kids have gone to bed..and gives me "me-time".  I love the way he's stuck by me for 10 years through all our hard times..and never cheated on me.. disrespected me or made me feel less of a woman.  <br>  And the list goes on.. and on.. and on..|`|AA10303168	Everything.  His smile his laugh..|`|Mlwd5Bt3aa	I love my boyfriend, because he always says he loves me even when I'm being a complete brat and even when I get mad at him, he'll find a way to make me laugh without trying and I'll forget what was bothering me.  I love that he will keep telling me he loves me and never gets tired of it, even though I always ask him over and over.  I love that way he laughs at the silly things I say and response with "I love you".  I love that he said he fell in love with me the instant he knew me and that even though I hurt him in the past he never lost his love.  I love that he calls me "Kitten". I love that he sleeps with the tv on and that his favorite food is spaghetti.  I love that his main concern is to take care of his mom, even though he make fun of her sometimes and acts like he doesn't care to me, I know he loves her the most and it shows when he is around her.  I love that asks me to make his favorite cookies even though I screw it up and make it too crispy, but he still says he loves them the most.  I love that he loves me with his whole heart.|`|XMxrkun5aa	Aww your husband sounds great!<br>  <br>  My boyfriend that I've been with for 5 years (I'm 19 now.. yes..he's my highschool sweetheart =D) is absolutely amazing. He's my best friend, my love, my strength. We've been through everything together including the death of his father, and my battle with serious depression.  He's always been there for me through everything. He's compassionate, driven, and a great listener. He's my intellectual equal and always knows how to make me laugh and keep things interesting. He can always make me feel beautiful, even if I'm having the worst day. <br>  I'd be utterly lost without him. He's my everything. <3|`|a54c9237177d737931453cb38462090caa	My fiance is always leaving little surprises for me. Like this morning, I had to work very early, so he work up before me...made me some coffee and put it in my travel mug and made a litle breakfast. When I stumbled out to the kitchen there it was sitting on the table with a little card telling me to have a great day and that he loved me. All the while I thought he was just sleeping the whole time!<br>  Or when I was studying for finals, he would write words of encouragement and love on notecards and put them randomly in my books or in the notecards I was currently memorizing.<br>  Also, he spends quality time with my family and has created a wonderful relationship with them as well. So there aren't any of the awkward moments and he'll even go on camping trips with my Dad and brother like he's one of the family members too.|`|nMnctxm9aa	I admire my husband for loving me uncoditionally.

Por muitas vezes procuramos desviar nosso olhar daquela pessoa que nos imp?e sua miséria, mas que na verdade essa miséria também é nossa. <br>  Por alguns anos participei de um grupo que distribuia sopas em latinhas no centro do RJ. Foram aquelas pessoas, que muitas vezes fiz quest?o de n?o ver quando passava na rua, que me ajudaram a mudar todo meu conceito de vida, me fizeram crescer, amadurecer, me mostraram que n?o somos nada. Nas minhas andan?as com o grupo, vi pessoas se degradando aos poucos, morrendo de fome, de doen?as, se entregando aos vícios, se misturando ao lixo. Pessoas que um dia tiveram famílias, lares, amigos, filhos, que tiveram  uma vida como a nossa, ou que nunca conseguiram ter esse prazer. Todos temos uma história, seja boa ou ruim, mas temos e de um momento pro outro podemos mudar o roteiro do filme da vida. Há bem pouco tempo conheci uma pessoa que foi mendiga, hoje, apesar de todos os olhares que se desviaram dela nas cal?adas, misturada ao lixo, conseguiu mudar o rumo da história. <br>  Sabe, a vida nos surpreende, quem diria que as pessoas, pra quem por muitas vezes desviei o olhar, iriam mudar minha história de vida? Eu achava que distribuindo aquela sopa estaria ajudando aos mais necessitados, so que n?o era bem assim, na verdade eles que me ajudaram, e muito, pois aprendi a n?o desviar os olhos da vida, dos problemas, me ensinaram a ser forte, a crescer a enfrentar as dificuldades de frente, aprendi a ser humilde, generosa,  a ouvir, a sorrir, e principalmente a amar.<br>  Com toda certeza hoje esse bebado te ajudou a mudar sua vida, já consegue ver as pessoas com outros olhos, ele te levou a reflex?o e vc, ao expor aqui esse seu aprendizado, também está colaborando para que muitas outras pessoas reflitam. <br>  Desculpa pela resposta t?o longa, mas deixei o cora??o falar e a emo??o fluir.<br>  Seja feliz sempre.<br>  bjs|`|6b4CZCOZaa	é muito complicado ser dominado pelo vício, pois abrimos m?o das nossas necessidades para mantê-lo.|`|84c99466bf29a2381fe32fe3fc2a61a5aa	Parabéns, você agiu de forma justa e caridosa.|`|WSfNWhzUaa	que coisa...até eu parei para refletir agora....<br>  meu pai bebe...é viciado....isso é muito triste....a pessoa perde a dignidade é como se tivesse vendido a alma para o diabo e a sua unica op??o é viver vagando pelo mundo sem pensar em outra coisa a n?o ser beber....<br>  que bom que vc pagou o almo?o..poderia ser meu pai....<br>  um abra?o...|`|YgnvqftOaa	Mário, tenho certeza que hoje vc. e todos nos aqui crescemos um pouquinho com o que esse homem lhe disse.<br>  S?o li??es de vida...<br>  Paz!|`|brU0G3Pvaa	pois é, uma vez um bebado me disse para eu parar de trabalhar no bar, se nao eu ia morrer atras de um balcao,fiquei sem arte naquele momento|`|cQl37QcAaa	Este assunto também é discutido em Marketing, quando você foca em desejos e necessidades.<br>  Quando você tem sede a sua necessidade é beber agua, e o desejo é um suco, um refrigerante...|`|jCBHcMpsaa	Parabéns.<br>  Merece uma estrelinha por isso!<br>  Se muitos dessem conta do grande problema que temos!,<br>  Se nos mesmo reavaliarem nossos costumes,e nossa atitudes,com certeza o mundo mudaria,n?o totalmente claro!<br>  Mais cada um fazendo sua parte,iria melhorar um bom peda?o.<br>  <br>  beijus.|`|0eeTb0kkaa	Você tem raz?o, as vezes achamosque quem bebe ou fuma ou cheira, faz por que quer e esquecemos que s?o seres humanos que comem, bebem; vivem, mas é dificil, n?o precisa ficar com vergonha, pois o que aprendemos desde que nascemos é que quem é viciado é por que quer e n?o tem vergonha,mas estamos muito errados, o problema é para mudar isto teriamos que nos transformar em outras pessoas, sermos totalemnte diferentes e isto é um pre?o muito alto que talvez n?o temos disposi??o para mudar, mas foi fofo e gentil da sua parte ter pago o almo?o, parabêns pela li??o.|`|349e02508ed17b57e323668991b5da53aa	Sim terrível, vc, fez bem, a dificuldade com o vício é que as pessoas n?o querem parar e tem que partir delas, ent?o o jeito é compadecer-se e ajudar.|`|539270258a2b099d679d0208b6b2f0aeaa	é phoda...|`|55c0285d6d8cb66138fd4777c93f46e4aa	Realmente é trágico...o que a bebida assim como cigarro e drogas podem fazer com uma pessoa e sua família.<br>  <br>  Todavia meu amigo o 'argumento' dele n?o se justifica, ele na verdade precisa mais que alimentar o vício da bebida, se tratar seriamente desse mal. é o mesmo argumento de que "o Ladr?o rouba para comer"... um mal n?o justifica o outro.

Me imagino que personas mayores de 35 o 40 que esten recien experimentando la vida sexual de personas casadas estaran un poco mas estresadas. Para las personas mas jovenes o del grupo de 20-30 suele ser mas adaptable.

Sé lo que sentis, sé lo que se siente sentirse desplazada, ignorada derepente; pareceria que los encontraron algo más importante que hacer, pero somos personas con sentimientos.Si pienso en frio te diria, y me diria a mi misma que los ignoremos y que no los llamemos,que hagamos nuestra vida, que le hagamos sentir que nosotras tambien encontramos algo mejor; pero la verdad es que el rechazo duele, y yo prefiero que me odien antes de que me ignoren.Yo que vos, y si pensas seguir con él, no le hablaria más del tema y dejaria que pasé el tiempo, intentaria darle un poco de celos, como para que empiece a pensaar que me puede perder, no sé si funcionaria pero..... no se me ocurre nada más.<br>  Bueno amiga, compartimos el mismo dolor, espero que las cosas cambien para ambas.<br>  <br>  besos|`|84f54fb2a4310b77a33a2f9ed1dc4240aa	Creo que no te has dado cuenta de algo, seguramente este patrón de conducta de tu novio, siempre se repite, siempre te deja para "más tarde", observa cómo se desenvuelve contigo en todas las actividades y verás que casi nunca ocupas el primer lugar en su lista de prioridades. Así? para qué quieres casarte con alguien asi?|`|9f85d428e929da1a21254603343a6a16aa	Pues si no encajas en "sus proyectos" entonces no eres tan importante para él. El casarse no tiene que ser obstáculo para seguir con los planes de trabajo o profesionales. Al contrario, tu espos@ te alienta a seguir adelante y cumplir tus metas.<br>  <br>  Si para él eres más un estorbo que una pareja, mejor deja de perder tu tiempo, mejor perder tres a?os que más no crees?|`|S5Ecb23Uaa	cada persona tiene proridades y sobre todo metas que cumplir.. el que aun no quiera casarse no quiere decir que no e ame simplemente q tiene otros proyectos antes de dar ese paso.. es mejor que platiques con el y le preguntes cuales son sus planes contigo para que tu definas si quieres esperar o definitivamente dejarlo y no seguir perdiendo el tiempo y si tu decision fuera seguir a su lado no lo sigas presionando con eso pues lo unico que lograras es que deje de quererte y volverte un fastidio para sus planes...platicalo con el expongan sus prioridades y hasta donde quieren llevar su relacion.. mucha suerte!!!|`|bKc5NUHlaa	Antes de responderte me gustaria saber que edad tienen.<br>  Tambien a que te referis con eso de estar lejos tuyo.<br>  Mas datos...|`|ebwvVWWIaa	no lo tomes de esa forma, a mi hace un mes me dieron esa opcion, nunca dudes de k el te kiere, si llevas tanto tiempo, yo creo que si, pero habla con el, si en vdd en algun momento kiere star contigo, como te repito hace un mes mi novio me dijo k me casara, la diferencia es k llevabamos muy poko, aunk yo creia esa relacion diferent a todas las k habia tenido, no sta en mis planes, yo lo keria disfrutar y k nos conocieramos mas, el me dijo k era una egoista y k no lo kise nunka, pero solo k yo pienso k todo tiene un tiempo, nada mejor como pensarlo y saber k es el con el k kieres star, piensa las cosas, y yo creo k solo es cuestion d k sta decision no altere sus planes de vida d ninguno de los 2 ok|`|ohMOHuKFaa	bueno esta en una situacion muy dura, son dos personas con prioridades diferentes, yo tambien siento lo mismo asea no es que quiera casarme todavia pero siento que para mi novio hay muhcas cosas prioritarias en su vida y yo estoy despues de eso, quiero enterderlo tiene mucho potencial y ganas de echar para delante pero siento que con su  su falta de tiempo se destruye la realacion.<br>  bueno amigui lo que podria aconsejar que se sienten a hablar y concreten algo, no es nada lindo sentir que la poersona que uno ama no quere lo mismo que una|`|ptCyxkMwaa	Yo dure 4 a?os con mi maridito antes de llegar a querer casarme, el me dijo desde los 7 meses de noviazgo que queria casarse, y yo no, por lo que te recomiendo que no lo presiones, yo me case hasta que estuve segura, sin embargo nunca deje de amar a mi marido, sólo que tenia otros planes, dale tiempo al tiempo, sin presionar :)|`|VMd74PHYaa	te entiendo perfectamente. Yo tengo mas de 4 a?os con mi novio y si fuera por mi desde hace a?os que estariamos casados. El se fue a E.U a trabajar y no me gusta nada el amor a distancia. siempre me dice que pronto estaremos juntos y nomas nada, siempre hay un problema que se le presenta para no venir. Mi consejo es que hables seriamente con el , y que de una vez te diga si esta dispuesto a casarse contigo o no. No quisiera que pasaras por lo ismo que yo. porque de verdad es fustrante estar esperando a que se llegue el dia que maduren.|`|e08889fd65133cdd4554ca648f4b2cf1aa	mira los hombres nunkaq estan preparados para el matrimonio, ni para hijos, nosotros somos mas maduras en ese aspecto, lo ke te rekomiendo es ke le plantees el problema de ke tu deceo es kasarte y formar una familia kon el, plantea tus pos y contras y ke tu deceas estar en sus proyectos de vida, laborales no se ke proyectos se refiere, pero si el dice ke no ta preparado tienes ke pensar bien las kosas de seguir o dejarlo no puedes perder tiempo si es ke lo ves de esa manera...|`|cc19b772b4f9e2ea602c97dbfaa349ddaa	Sorry.. no eres prioridad... mejor déjalo estas perdiendo tu tiempo|`|0MTYOx29aa	obviamente sus prioridades son diferentes... la tuya... casarte.. la de el... sus proyectos... no dudo que te ame.. pero asi son los hombres... si quieres un consejo, deja de presionarlo porque puede fastidiarse... si sientes que no llegarán a nada pronto... mejor separarse a seguir perdiendo el tiempo... o puedes darle el tiempo que te pide.. aunque sea indefinido... tu decides... suerte!!!|`|31d1656473ed71d608f2ab5963799d79aa	Pues, él ha sido claro contigo.... tiene proyectos que desea cumplir.... y tambien dice que te ama. Estan en distintas etapas, tu quieres casarte... no has dicho que lo ames.. solo has dicho que quieres casarte y si de eso se trata, puedes hacerlo con otro. El dice que te ama y que necesita tiempo y que tiene proyectos que cumplir... tu sabras si estas en condiciones de esperarlo, o no.  Tal vez no estè dispuesto aùn a asumir semejante compromiso contigo. Un alejamiento no es ruptura, talvez necesite tiempo y un poco de aire para reflexionar sobre sus prioridades, que no son las mismas que las tuyas, eso es claro.|`|TBM1EuyDaa	no es que prefiera estar lejos de ti , esque asi como a ti te ama, ha dedicado mucho tiempo a su proyecto, y si quieres compartir tu vida con el debes pensar en que todo lo que tu lo apoyes los fortalecera y todo lo que el preofesionalmente haga te conviene y es motivo de celebracion, entinde su punto de vista, ya que el te ama y solo te esta diciendo que lo esperes, por que su proyecto lo absorbe y quiere darte el tiempo que te mereces|`|aa0880328c6f531b9e9318fa380e088baa	El casamiento es cosa de estar de acuerdo los dos, no importa las razones que él tenga, si no se quiere casar mejor no lo presiones por que no va a funcionar tu matrimonio, imagínate si tienes problemas en estos momentos, qué será cuando te cases?

Pues bien, ya desnudos decidí que no debía lastimarla así que la dejé ir "viva". Luego me arrepentí por ello, pero aquí viene lo interesante, a?os después ella le contó la historia a una de sus amigas... y eventualmente me convertí para todo el barrio donde vivía en el "mariposón" (EMO) del lugar... una fama que me persiguió durante mucho tiempo a pesar de lucir como todo un "macho".<br>  <br>  A?os atrás, de pura casualidad, ella y yo fuimos compa?eros de trabajo, unos pocos meses antes de casarme, platicamos de aquella vez... y me dijo algo interesante: Que desde aquel día a la fecha (habían pasado unos 12 a?os) siempre creyó que yo era el mejor hombre sobre la tierra, que me admiraba mucho, y que lamentaba no haber tenido el valor de conquistarme... que me respetaba por haberla respetado y que me lo agradecía y que todos esos a?os me había visto de lejos y que estaba enamorada de mí...<br>  <br>  Arrepentirme, claro que lo he hecho... he hecho cosas que para muchos son estupideces, pero, siempre con el tiempo alguna persona se ha acercado a darme las gracias por lo que hice o dejé de hacer.<br>  <br>  Espero que la historia te sirva.

If she doesnt like you and wont date you simply for your ink then she isnt that special.

During conversation point out of of your tattooes and explain to her what the meaning is behind it and/or why you got it. If it seems as though she doesn't have a problem with them then ask her out. However if you want to just shock her and yourself the next time you see her just ask her out, what the worse that can happen other than her saying no. You won't know how she feels about you or the tattooes if you don't ask. Take the chance. Think positive.|`|e4a1ea7a987a48e7a0efe283a8472ba9aa	yeah man just ask her out hey.

So when I was younger, she used to try to stuff me like a turkey. I just tell her I'm full, and dramatize it a litte. I also used to eat the junk food right in front of her face so she knows I eat. Bring that up when she accuses you of being anorxic. What I'm trying to say is show her that you aren't anorexic without changing your lifestyle now, just make sure she sees you eating at least and call her on it when she accuses you of being anorexic.|`|27f124840cc2c05731597954aa2f6a4baa	Tell her to take you on vacation, something like a cruise.

You don't and she is welcome to watch you all day one day, or you'll keep a food diary for a week.

I'm a greek girl who happens to have a mum like yours. Here in Greece the food is very "heavy", heavy sauses and traditional food. When I ignore all these stuff my mum starts saying that I'm becoming anorexic like the girls on tv. At the beginning I was yelling at her because I didn't want to start a convercation because she was absolutely wrong. However, the key to the solution i coversation, that's when my mun and I got together. Tell her to eat with you lunch or dinner and eat slowing so that you can eat less quantity in a longer time. Try to eat healthily when you are around her. Maybe this is the reason she calls you anoxecix. Many mums don't know the real meaning of the word. Show her models that are like skinny and compaire them with your healthy body. Try to be calm and have some patient and I'm sure that you will work it out. Let me know how it goes!

d968c3e587be9a5daf07fea7633eacf4aa	A une époque où les ressources et notamment alimentaires étaient limitées, la gourmandise est soeur de l'égo?sme, de l'avarice et de la convoitise.<br>  Par ailleurs la gourmandise, en ce qu'elle consiste à profiter de bienfaits terrestres, est en contradiction avec l'idéal chrétien qui repose sur la privation et la punition (pour éviter la corruption de l'ame, cela va sans dire).<br>  <br>  Il y a dans la gourmandise une forme d'addiction - parfois jusqu'à l'excès - qui n'est pas présente dans l'épicurisme par exemple, addiction dont on n'est plus capable de se défaire ensuite.<br>  La gourmandise de l'alcool donne l'alcoolisme. Est-ce vraiment un bienfait ?<br>  <br>  La phényléthylamine qui envahit le cerveau au contact des phéromones (ou, spécificité humaine, à la simple suggestion pavlovienne de celles-ci), et la production régulière de dopamine, font de l'amoureux passionnel rien de vraiment très différent d'un toxicomane qui réclame sa "dose"  d'héro ou de crack. Là encore, la gourmandise est vilaine car elle n'est que l'habit présentable de l'addiction. Si se priver de ce qu'on aime n'est pas agréable, construire une dépendance (f?t-elle agréable) c'est détruire une liberté, car on devine facilement qu'on risque de se priver de beaucoup d'autres choses pour nourrir cette gourmandise, et avec une fausse et trompeuse sensation de liberté.<br>  <br>  Il devient donc difficile de naviguer entre la privation du plaisir et la privation de la liberté !|`|0a53235e070fadcaf2224c9b088551e9aa	Peut etre parce qu'elle revient cher (vu le prix des patisserie!) et qu'elle n'est pas tres bonne pour la santé en trop grande quantitée (pas pour le regime, pour la santé en general!)<br>  Et puis les personnes qui se goinfrent enormement (pas juste par petite gourmandise) on en general des problemes plus serieux derriere (angoisse, deprime...).<br>  Mais, une tite gaterie de temps en temps, t'as raison il y a pas de quoi se priver!|`|1d5291075dab590fc63153a771bc2b10aa	cela dépend de qu elle genre de gourmandises<br>  il y a celles que font prendre des kilos <br>  et puis d autres , dont je suis tout particulièrement friande<br>  bise|`|gG0HRqAGaa	c est un exces et les exces sont mauvais pour la santé.<br>  l obésité peut mettre une vie en danger|`|jc1G3VEuaa	P@rce qu'aux yeux de certaines religions, elle est assimilée à la cupidité qui est un péché : en somme, on peut user mais ne pas abuser.

N?o que ele n?o goste de vc mas, tem horas que a pessoa quer se desligar um pouco da rela??o, viver a vida dele, e n?o a do casal. Vc tbm, aproveite e vá fazer outras coisas, algum curso, sair com as amigas, fazer faxina da casa, qualquer coisa que te ocupe, e fa?a com que vc n?o fique pensando só nele. às vezes, ignorar um pouquinho a pessoa, faz com que ela passe a dar mais aten??o a vc.

Ahora fijate en que tan frecuente te hace esa pregunta, que cara pone, si cambia mas de lo normal va por buen camino, si sus ojos brillan o sus pupilas se dilatan entoncs lo mas seguro es que si nena, que este enamorado de ti. Solo un consejo, no te hagas muchas ilusiones, lo mejorr que puedes hacer es decirle "Pues pregrunta, no pierdes nada" y muy probablemente te preguntara o te dira que tiene dudas o miedo o confusion y que todavia no esta seguro, tu nada mas animalo a preguntar y listo.

There really isn't a 'should'. That's up to you.<br>  <br>  Just try dating and when you find the right one, or even just the right one for right now, you'll know. (and you'll probably be hurt when you lose that right-one-for-now, but if he doesn't come back to you, then you'll know that it's not right and that the right one is still out there) You'll get along very well, and I would say to look for awkward moments too. (if there aren't any, that's a very good sign) There's a difference between an awkward moment and just a feeling of not being able to think of anything to say.|`|A8UAkxPTaa	your probably gonna ignore this...but oh well... if you look for commitment aobut 7x out of 10 you won't get it cuz ur dealing with high school guys.  if you sleep with everything around everyone will want you just for the purpose of sleeping with you and you'll be branded as easy and a slu*. that and you'll have a harder time dealing with yourself. by the way don't assume going out with a older guy will solve your problem because well 8x out of 10 we will use you cause we understand the game better and your just easy prey.  your best bet is to <br>  <br>  A) go out with guys, and use it as learning experience for when your older and you meet someone who is mature enough for a real relationship<br>  <br>  B)keep going out with guys till you find one that is rdy for commitment<br>  <br>  C)not go out with anyone and just wait till college where 6.5x out 10 we are still not ready for commitment.<br>  <br>  D)don't go out with guys instead sit on the sidelines and pick the one that seems perfect when your about 24 yrs old.<br>  <br>  I recommend options A and C more so C.|`|AA10932787	well...u r a bit addict to these kind of physical relationships.....teen relationships just means being a friend of one another untill both of u know each other very well and are a bit matured to take good decisions....so my advice is to u is that keep yrself in control as u r too young.....|`|TmWVS2NIaa	If you can find someone that loves you for who you are then go for it.

YEmsWyOJaa	well the first one she might have felt to young, not ready for...<br>  2. and 3. i assume are twins as both 12, maybe she couldn't handle them both and bonded more with number 2,...<br>  than the 4th... well maybe she bonded with this one, or felt obligated, i don't know,...<br>  I was adopted into a loving, caring home. My parents adoped my (step?) brother when he was 3 and myself the day before my 1st Bday. <br>  My biological mother gave birth to me when she was 18 and couldn't handle me. She allready had given a boy away 2years earlier,... and when i met her 9 years ago she had given birth to a totol of 10 Boys and myself with 10 different fathers!!! AND was trying for another girl... lol she gave ME away.<br>  I don't hold nothing against my mother, in fact im thankfull for her to give me away, gosh i've had so much luck...<br>  <br>  Than again, i've got 2boys now, 2 different fathers... but at least i'm married and that's it. PERIOD, NO MORE KIDS...<br>  <br>  I'm still struggling to bond with my 5 year old... with my 3 year old i bonded as soon as i found out i was pregnant... yet my 5year old... i never bonded with. And i feel guilty about it. I try not to show him that i love his brother more, but without success...what is so hard for me with my oldest came so naturel with my youngest... does that make it right? NO, i know it doesn't. <br>  So, your inlaw... i'm sure she had her reasons. may they have been emotional or financial.... i don't know. <br>  However i am pretty sure she never intended to harm any of those children and tried what she felt was best for everyone involved. Maybe it's post partum? <br>  Maybe God had different plans for 2 of her children<br>  Everyone has to walk on their own paths...<br>  I'm sure she is regretting a lot of actions she took earlier...<br>  so am i and i'm sure YOU would change things in your past if you could.<br>  The Lord works in misterious ways!!!<br>  Mel|`|Cd5avmhWaa	is she retarded? when you bring a child into the world you are supposed to love them unconditionally, not give them away.

He even drives his own car to his volunteer job and wants to go out for a beer with the older guys [they're all good guys] & play darts. We just have to let them live their lives, we have to trust God.  I could talk him into staying home and 'safe' but no that is wrong, he needs to be out there and socializing. Tell your daughter there is a time to be a useful and productive member of society, now she is an adult and every adult must do their share. Her job is to babysit sometimes, there is also a time to go out and have fun too.  Tell her you appreciate her babysitting and she is very needed in the family, because she enables you to bring home the money for the bills. I hope she has some spending money.

Quand nous nous rendons compte de l'opinion qu'il se fait de nous ou pire lorsque que nous pensons le savoir, nous nous sentons enfermés dans ce r?le qui n'es pas le notre. Nous avons à nous justifier de nos actions ou non actions. Le regard de l'autre s'introduit en nous.

qFWYpIvLaa	Rosas sin duda, ya que son bellas, tienen un aroma sutil pero agradable y tambien tiene espinas, que te recuerdan que en todo hasta lo más bello existen dificultades, en las que hay que marchitarse y con la experiencia adquirida, volver a florear con un color  más brillante, e impregnar a los que nos toquen con un delicioso aroma de paz.<br>   Gracias por preguntar. me encantó!!|`|11412c4a6bc9c3c822fcf5c9c8cc1a3daa	Estimado Classic: En primer término no solo me gustó lo que preguntaste, sino el estilo de tu pregunta. Ojalá todos los que usamos este medio pudiéramos hacer el esfuerzo de moldear una pregunta como tú lo has hecho y no ver como algunos derrochan su tiempo y entorpecen el vocabulario con respuestas o preguntas rayanas en la estupidéz. FELICITACIONES. Respondiendo a tu pregunta, digo: La vida de cada ser humano constituye de por sí un libro, que sabemos cuando se inicia pero no sabemos cuando finaliza. Las contigencias de la vida sobrevuelan y hacen pié a cada instante de tu vida. Cada instante de vida nos proporciona una  nueva experiencia. Experiencia que se mixtura entre lo sórdido y lo honesto, entre lo bello y lo feo, entre la risa y las lágrimas, entre el fracaso y el éxito, etc. Esta manera de ver y decir"ENTRE", es precisamente la diferencia de matices de gris que dominan nuestra vida. Para la humanidad, la vida no es negra ni blanca absolutamente. Todo está envuelto en el manto neblinoso de nuestra precariedad existencial. En concordancia con mi particular visión, que puede no convencer pero si ser materia de opinión, pasaré a decirte que, cualquier flor la que sea que recibamos entre las páginas de nuestro libro (que es lo mismo decir: en cualquier instante de nuestra vida), es un toque necesario de sutil belleza, que solo los que aman la naturaleza saben comprender el profundo y etéreo significado de su existencia. Con afecto Carlos.|`|3tUhJqWxaa	pues mi libro seria, los 10 secretos de la abundante felicidad y mis flores, pues las rosas rojas|`|70ab364d83df8b21eb8e52b172ed7891aa	ROSA NEGRA<br>  no todo lo que brilla es oro|`|74773a029ed1945c9e86c25de5a1f3ffaa	Linda pregunta....

dhCsJIiUaa	well, in a sense true.  the man's level of commitment dictates how he would perceive a potential "option".  if he is fully committed to the relationship, then other ladies are just that - other ladies - and not an option for a mate.  if he is less than fully committed, then ladies that come by are evaluated against his criteria and are rated as an option.  so yes, a man is only as faithful as his options, with options not meaning the availability or presence of potential mates, but the perception of such.|`|9db8144ee896a2f272ae89e078f398e3aa	no true or false, being faithful is not a choice, people born with it.<br>  <br>  faithful people are rare, thats why a lot of lies and cheating cases going on.|`|AA10820563	A man can have many options and choose to do what he wants.

zvDXhj3Uaa	ahh well your doing the right thing by not talking to him, and good for you for letting him go... so you had break up sex... was it your first time doing that? i mean everyone does that. and probably what was going through his mind as well was that he A.) wanted to get off lol and B.) knew the same thing you did.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped a little bit, just remember, your not the only one this happens too.|`|JTOD5vn6aa	well i think you should because ending it with sex in the dumbest ever u liked him loved him. i think he was thinking one you love him so much you can handle what is going on and or you where in pain like phisical pain|`|LWMT5QgPaa	wow!, that musta felt great if u cried!|`|db9607e067890a395fb0b6c686b4c546aa	felt like da man boa!|`|kVichAxPaa	Under the circumstances if you just tell him that you cried because you liked the sex so much and you are sad that the two you will not be able to continue, I think he will understand why you cried. Would be best to clarify that if not in person maybe by letter.
3mvvP9Ejaa	You need to have a serious talk with this guy and tell him that you are no longer going to put up with his possesive ways.  This is the perfect way to kill a relationship because eventually you will get tired of this behavior.|`|c5ec0014eaccadd1063404da7009e9a4aa	shocked!  a baby daddy?!  you can't stop him, just leave him.|`|GiypJ0Awaa	speaking from experience, they only get worse as the days pass. men seem to think that as soon as you have a baby with them or get married to them, you will never leave them. do you love him? thats the thing to think about. if you see yourself with him, and if you think he is worth going through all this. you know you  can always find someone better, but it depends on if you want to. a relationship is based on trust, if he doesnt trust you there is no relationship. but, if you want to make this work out you should talk to him about it. maybe threaten him a little, dont make it seem that you will stay with him no matter what, or else it will get worse, you have to put limits.<br>  hope i helped. and hope you make the right decision.|`|2n9G04jjaa	He'll probably see this too.<br>  Get yourself a diary. Write down every psycho or controlling thing he does, get a lawyer and keep him as far away from  you and your kid as he can be.  Dont worry about child support. The dude is a maniac and you both need to be rid of him before something terrible happens.|`|8377fe3184964e5d8a92ec96c6553e76aa	Leave him...That psycho will not change...Don't be like those women in the news that were killed by  jealous, possessive, insecure guys.|`|FwFl7kwAaa	Nothing you can do, cooperate of else.|`|f5257e3c221c1513cf0009c088115004aa	get out now he could be very dangerous to be with also talk to him about getting help. He will deny havin a problem ( i did too) but he needs to deal with his trust issue to be a better person for his self then try again for a relationship. But most of all he must get the help or you need to go|`|4e7YIR2Laa	As hard as this sounds.... You have to let him go.|`|VPLnJ2iJaa	Get out - get out as peacefully and as soon as possible!  The baby does complicate things, but this could escalate inta a dangerous situation!
LSCYlOpAaa	Of course it isn't bad. Not in my opinion it isn't. It is the call of NATURE for a woman to want/need a man and a man to want/need a woman. That's a natural thing. I dont think it's "bad" at all.|`|5cf66039ef520b1198f1cf0c46a18926aa	hi,<br>  no it is not bad to want a guy in your life, but to need a guy in your life that is a different thing. you need to love yourself and your life more than needing a man. your girls can only do so much with your friends, that understandability, what do you do when you are alone that is something else, if you can not enjoy your time alone then how can someone else enjoy being around you, you have to find that part of yourself the part that likes being with you,and in the long run the next boyfriend you get will see your better side the side that like her self.|`|zvDXhj3Uaa	No ive been single for the same amout of time and im ready to bust if i don't get a girl in my life lol.

BmXbXOkbaa	well after a little time has passed in any relationship most men feel that they dont have to try so hard to immpress you ladies we get in what i call the comfort zone.its just that hes comfortable in the relationship alot of men rely on the woman to keep the spice in the relationship|`|Z6mKM1DOaa	Because men are inherently narcissistic, selfish creatures, LOL!  I would suggest you speak to him in the context of *your* wants and desires, as opposed to "you don't do this anymore".  Speaking in "I" terms is much less likely to put him on the defensive, and he'll know in no uncertain terms that you are expressing what you want and need from him.<br>  <br>  All you can do is let him take it from there.  Hopefully he will respond to you in a positive way, and will make an effort to give you what you want.  If he doesn't,  I would have to re-evaluate why I'm in a relationship with someone who thinks so little of my needs.|`|47Jtrk3Baa	because they suck|`|DTHEzn6Naa	Girlfriend, if he can't show you his affection in ways you like then he probably aren't the guy you thought he was.  Me, I would tell him to rub his own self since he can't take the time to give me the same time as I gave him.  You have to let him know how you feel and put your feet down as to your feelings and let him know that he isn't the only person in this relationship.  If two can't work together at least on this subject then how will you work together on other subjects.<br>  <br>  He might show you affections in other ways but he suppose to express his feelings and affections in every way possible as you do for him.  There shouldn't be one thing that he couldn't show any affections toward you.<br>  <br>  You really need to let him know how you feel and don't back down.
c4233da4eebf89f0c3478060efbd8517aa	Sounds like he isn't over his feelings for his x, he is definetely over reacting and holding on to those feelings. Confront him without anger and hostility, be honest about how it makes you feel and if he cannot accept that and make some changes, you better think about moving on. Your feelings will only be hurt by staying with him and you will never have the relationship you deserve. Good Luck.|`|AA11265002	Here comes the advice:<br>  <br>  1. You want to be with a girl who likes you for you... not to take you as a rebound and I don't think he can be that guy for you<br>  2. He's not over his first and is comparing you to her<br>  <br>  = you need to get out of this quick|`|AA12228568	dont let it get to your head, just think that if he ever loses you its his loss|`|477dc1b8116656c68e76d4b8e4b828a1aa	Things may be over between him and his ex, but he obviously still has some feelings for her or he wouldn't act this way. I don't think you're overreacting by being upset about it, he's being a jerk! If I were you I'd ask him about it. You should ask him if he still has any feelings for his ex and tell him that when he talks about her it bothers you.|`|YzZlWXwbaa	I think something is wrong with your bf.  How could he been so stupid telling or keep reminding his ex in front of you? Do he really love you?? How bout you just confront him and ask him why he always do that to you?? Its not about jealousy problem because how could he keep thinking bout his ex while he already have you by his side..|`|c0MGzGVoaa	maybe he loves you with all his heart....and you dont realize.. it... maybe hes just bothered by the fact that you even talk about his exgirflriend......maybe he had bad experience with her and doesnt like it when soemthing reminds her of him.... youv been toghether for 1 year and 2 months since feb 14 and u think he still thinks about his ex ex girlfriend? i think he just has bad experiences with her and doesnt even want to go there?|`|gJDsuVpWaa	Sounds like things are already screwed up between you two.  I don't think you're overreacting or being unnecessarily jealous.  What he's doing is disrespectful.  Either he needs to live in the present relationship or you need to let him go.  You shouldn't feel like you have to messure up to anybody!!

445d5e6206209fbeaab6ed5e9d3eff2daa	Uhh...I guess it depends on how good friends you are with the person to start with. I've had two 'friends with benefits' and with one, I wasn't interested in him for anything but sex, and we lived in different cities so only saw each other like once every six months BUT he developed 'feelings' for me and when I told him I didn't feel the same he got into a huff and we stopped speaking, but since I was never really friends with him before it didn't really hurt. The second one was perfect! We lived next door to each other and were friends of a sort, more like party buddies, and when we started sleeping together it worked fine. He'd have girls over and would introduce me, I'd have guys over and introduce him and then after our respective dates left we'd hook up. It was the perfect arrangement for an overactive libido.

Firstly you need to prove who you currently are, by supplying an up to date passport, drivers licence as proof of identity and then two utility bills, bank statements to provide proof of address. <br>  <br>  The two ways to change your name are either by Deed Poll or Statutory Declaration, both are legally accepted by any agency or government body in changing other relevant documents (such as new passports, driving licence). <br>  <br>  These need to be completed , witnessed and signed in the presence of a solicitor, magistrate or commissioner for oaths as you are then signing to say you revoke your previous name and will only use your new name in all circumstances. Once changed it is an offence (Fraud) to use your previous name. The service will cost approximetely 50 GBP. <br>  <br>  You will be provided with an original copy and it is always best to get a number (up to 5) certified copies of the original. Depending on what Government Department or Private company you are dealing with, you will be asked to provide the original (required fora psaaport) or certified copies. Having a number of these enables you to send off many name change requests at a time, remember to always request they be sent back. <br>  <br>  There are also a number of online companies that now specialize in providing documentation, which is legally accepted under UK law. These are generally cheaper, but take longer and any mistakes are not easily rectified.

But when it's not there, there is nothing that anyone can do. No amount of counseling or time spent trying to fix it is going to make you fall in love again. You need to find out what is most important to you and think of where you want to be in life. Hopefully everything will work out for you.|`|DzNIpiCTaa	You got married to young, I know and regret it all the time.<br>  Live your life there is so much you can do with your life.<br>  you dont have to be with someone to have a full life.|`|tKTudGfSaa	It looks like you were planning your wedding while you were still in the throws of the chemical/hormonal deluge of new love.  After that subsides, you get to see what you're really left with, and it sounds like you're left with not much.  You had the added disadvantage being young by today's standards.  You are still young, and so is she.  You are not doing her any favors by staying in an ambivalent relationship.  Give her the chance to find someone who will be able to appreciate and love her fully.  She sounds pretty evolved and should be able to find someone new.  Some people are saying that you should try dating/romancing her, but you've felt disconnected for six months, and I suspect it would be next to impossible to put that in reverse.

Al parecer, ninguno está registrado.<br>  <br>  El asesinato ocurrió anteanoche, cuando Gaspar Leonardo Balam Viana, de 29 a?os, y su amasia Martha María Cen estuvieron ingiriendo bebidas embriagantes en su hogar, un predio semiabandonado de la calle 44 No. 550-B con 73 del Centro.<br>  <br>  Luego de discutir, Balam Viana tomó un palo y le cayó a golpes a la mujer hasta dejarla inconsciente, ante ante la presencia de sus cuatro hijos.<br>  <br>  Después le pidió perdón, la levantó y la acostó en una vieja hamaca al tiempo que le ofrecía disculpas nuevamente.<br>  <br>  El sujeto se durmió creyendo que su mujer también estaba dormida, aunque en realidad ya había fallecido.<br>  <br>  A las 5 de la madrugada el homicida despertó, se acercó a la hamaca y comprobó que su amasia estaba muerta.<br>  <br>  De inmediato se dirigió al domicilio de su hermana, a quien le contó lo ocurrido y le pidió que fuera por sus cuatro hijos.<br>  <br>  Balam Viana, quien de acuerdo con sus vecinos se dedica a la malvivencia y al robo, retornó a su casa y dos horas después cruzó al predio de su vecino Víctor Manuel Gamboa y le dijo que hablara a la policía porque había matado a su mujer.<br>  <br>  Javier Medina Torre, titular de la SPV, confirmó que el sujeto se entregó a la policía.<br>  <br>  Las autoridades llegaron a la vivienda y encontraron al hombre junto al cuerpo de su mujer, de manera que lo detuvieron.<br>  <br>  Antes de ser trasladado a la cárcel, el sujeto pidió permiso para abrazar al cuerpo, que presentaba huellas visibles de la golpiza que le causó la muerte.<br>  <br>  El homicida aceptó haber dado muerte a la mujer, aunque aseguró que no fue su intención matarla, y reiteró que todo fue producto del alcohol y una discusión.<br>  <br>  El hombre admitió igualmente que en ocasiones anteriores golpeó a su amasia, con quien vivía desde hace más de 10 a?os.<br>  <br>  Incluso, a principios de marzo, la mujer fue golpeada en la misma vivienda, lo que produjo que se le adelantara el alumbramiento —estaba embarazada—, y que el hijo más peque?o de la pareja naciera en ese lugar.<br>  <br>  Ayer, agentes de la Policía Judicial y del Ministerio Público acudieron al sitio para levantar el cadáver y recoger evidencias, entre ellas el palo con que el sujeto le dio muerte a la joven madre.<br>  <br>  Los vecinos dijeron que la muerte era una situación que se esperaba, incluso en días pasados Martha María Cen les dijo que estaba contenta porque Balam Viana ya no le pegaba. Uno de los vecinos le respondió: “no te va a pegar.... te va a matar”, lo que finalmente sucedió anteanoche, a consecuencia de a?os de maltrato.— Carlos Gebhardt A. y CEM <br>  <br>  TU DESIDES!!!!|`|9338fcf442869e79ce7ddc8692dec9c9aa	dejalo, denuncialo, divorciate; busca ayuda profesional, ve a un psicologo, necesitas valorarte y mejorar esa autoestima que no esta nada bien ya que si has permitido que te agarre a golpes cuando este ga?an ha querido, e sque algo no esta bien dentro de ti, si no buscas ayuda profesional volveras a caer con un hombre similar; suerte.|`|WN0jd2tCaa	Estoy igual que chasita y Hi... no se què eres??|`|WNzfxKO5aa	no lo volvas a perdonar........busca ayuda...psicologica y tb un abogado........|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	Divorciarte<br>  Denunciarlo|`|d0813cfcb147d3efb8f1e70fe24767e0aa	Ya no tolerar que te pegue, de que se trata te gusta el masoquismo o que? mira tan luego el vea que tu te opones a que te ponga la mano encima y le contestes de igual forma aventandole lo que sea, verás que ese día se va a medir mas contigo o por lo menos la va a pensar en volver a hacerlo, sino te recuslta también puedes levantarle una queja y que vayan a detenerlo, al final lo perdonas porque entiendo que lo amas para permitirle eso, entonces con ese escarmiento verás que nuevamente lo pensara, necesitas liberarte y mostrar tu tambien la casta, no te dejes, si lo amas tienes que cambiar su forma de ser contigo y sino mándalo al diablo y déjalo en la carcel por el tiempo que se merezca.|`|da8a31979ecf0bf333f96f68006ee624aa	para que lo perdonas??,,,te gusta???,,,|`|3iPtE3Zpaa	eres una e s t u p i d a<br>  a las mujeres les gusta que les peguen<br>  deja que te siga pegando hasta que un dia te saque un ojo, pierdas tus dientes o igual pierdas la vida..<br>  el tipo lo vale no???<br>  siguele metida en la m i e---|`|470a28015a8ec86ffcd01106ae96e97aaa	pues ....creo que ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer no?|`|GhEX3TiDaa	armate de valor, no para golpearlo sino para alejarte de el y autovalorarte, toda persona merece un gran respeto y atencion,|`|KnGYgG97aa	en muchas ocasiones nos refugiamos en un mundo de seguridad que no nos permite avanzar… avanzar en el trabajo en la vida personal y familiar.

Una amiga me conto de un ecuatoriano que era super extremadamente grande y no pudo hacer nada porque su tama?o era tanto que la lastimaria, eso es peor que uno peque?o o mediano, ademas que la vagina se adapata al tama?o exacto, claro siempre y cuando sea posible la entrada.

Or you could try talking to the person or people involved, but if you are to scared or nervous to do that then maybe you should try telling a really really close friend that you know you can trust no matter what.

You are allowing yourself to feel the way you do and honestly until you confront yourself with your own emotions its when you will begin to heal and move forward.

Like finger foods that you can feed eachother, and chocolate covered strawberries. You can also have some wine, or something fancy to drink. Whatever you two like. Light some candles, and it's really magical. Or you can just eat by moonlight. If it's too hot outside, this can work inside too. I did that for my boyfriend and he loved it. He thought it was so sweet that I planned it all. You could always just go out to eat at a new place you two have both never been to, or something easy like that. It just depends on how much work you want to put into it. Hope this helps! :)

And when it was my turn to be on "the outs" it really really hurt.  I remember crying over it....feeling lonely... feeling disliked.... and then , sure enough, eventually we would all make-up and then it was another girls turn to feel the heat.  THANK GOD that all seems to end and Women really DO grow up and grow out of being mean to eachother.  It is wonderful as an adult to have women who are my REAL friends who would never do that to me.  I know it hurts that your friends are doing this to you, but you really need to know that they are not your true friends.  They are immature and only time, and wisdom will teach you how to choose your friends.  If I had it all to do over again ... I wouldnt have cared at ALL about being popular and hanging out with my posse of mean-girls.  I would have searched out real SOLID friendships with deeper meanings.  Just know that there will be  a time when Women dont act like that anymore.|`|575f92cc49aae94613e8b494971d2d63aa	Work on it one friend at a time.

d354794074ce84eb2c0bd0d7ac01c901aa	Es bien dificil, estar en una situación como la que te encuentras. Tengo una receta para ti, quieres encontrar paz en medio de esta soledad y sentirte satisfecha. Escucha musica cristiana, medita en sus palabras, y lee los Salmos. Con eso llenaras una parte de tu vida, pues realmente necesitaras otras cosas mas que sentirte satisfecha completa. No porque escuches esas cosas, quiere decir que te meteras a la religion, solo es una receta, de lo que yo hecho para salir tambien de un estado que estuve como el tuyo. Buscate una mascota, yo tuve que comprar una perrita, que sin el entretemiento de ella, estuviera ahora mismo en peores condiciones. Puedes jugar con tu mascota, llevarla a salir, te vas a un parque , la paseas, o vas solas y eso te ayudara, buscate un lugar que no existe mucho el ruido, un rio, un lago, un parque donde estes tranquila. La soledad se quita, teniendo la mente ocupada la mayor parte del tiempo. No es bueno, estar asi, pero debes hacer estas cosas, te ayudaran mucho, eso te lo puedo asegurar yo mismo. Porque he pasado por lo mismo.

Definitely dont walk up to her and just ask her like that but just bring it up in a conversation.  Or start off with asking how her weekend was and then ease the question on in.

Try calling him!!! that might work or if you choose not to.... the next time you see him say i didn't get your call! Are you into me at all, be honest i want the truth! Or are you just scared?

It get's em every time, and while you are shining, you'll find someone new.  Trust me, that's how I found my fiance...

AA10766729	I don't know what branch your man is in, but typically following boot camp, Training Schools (A & C), his sea-duty only lasts a maximum of 4 years, then he will rotate to shore-duty.  However, where he would WANT to be stationed (wherever you are, for example) and where there are billets open are two different matters.<br>  <br>  You don't mention how long you've been together or if HE is trying to hold things together as well.<br>  <br>  If you've been together a long time AND he's making an effort as well, just remind yourself that there IS a light at the end of the tunnel...it just depends on how long that tunnel still is.  If he is stationed currently in a "danger zone" I would recommend waiting till he comes back from his tour to break up; you don't want him distracted by your news if you break up via a "Dear John" letter.|`|f4dc4384fd4d513222ac48b4e718a39daa	gurl when he gets back he would want to be by your side when you do every thing. i know what it is like my ex-boyfrined is in the army .  but he said he when me to be with some one esle becuase he was going to iraq.  but he still emailes me and say i miss u and love u .|`|IDf4c7z7aa	It depends. Are you getting the impression that he isn't into the relationship? If so, just let it go. Deployments are hard on both sides (but more hard on the Soldier), and it can be difficult not to loose interest in your significant other. The brutal, honest truth is a lot of people cheat on both sides of a deployment. So if you're getting the impression he isn't into the relationship, he might not be anymore. And in this day and age, he will get deployed again (unless his ETS is up soon,) so if you break it off in the middle of the deployment, and he comes crying back after he gets home, definitely don't take him back! You're just a convenience thing to him if that happens. On the other hand, are you the one that's bored? If so, you need to decide whether or not this is a lifestyle you can deal with. Being a military wife (if you get married in the future) is probably the hardest kind of spouse to be. You'll only see him half of the time, your kids will be deprived of a steady relationship with their father, and you'll have to be both the mom (nurturing) and dad (hard-*** and disciplinarian) half of the time. It will be hard. But if you love him, you can make it work. If he loves you, he deserves someone who can endure the military lifestyle. Remember, Soldiers are away from their home, their family and many of their friends, not just you. The only thing you've lost is him. You can't understand what he's going through, but you have to believe that it's more difficult than what you're going through.|`|dd4b180e7151fcf5a9aacc308e094e87aa	If you ask me, I believe he is proving to be dependable, loyal to a cause, sharp, courageous, in the service of his country, and selfless.  If you want to try your luck with any other guys back here in the world I do not think you will find those qualities.  Stay with him.  You might be having a tough time here, but then again nobody is shooting at you on a daily basis nor blowing themselves up trying to take you with them.  In a way he is risking his life for all of us.  Pray he comes home soon and in one piece.|`|w4YdWhDDaa	u also join in military..or else go to airforce..

BtEk36tQaa	u just did ! call me|`|15WW6YT7aa	go n talk to him..|`|CNYhoQuCaa	well i dunno|`|2heMly1Haa	Since there doesnt seem to be enough time left for coy flirting,  the best you can do is just go up to him and say hi. It doesnt necessarily have to be a first move as such. Just make small talk. Obviously you have your class in common. so ask him something related to that or maybe ask him what he plans to do next. Just be friendly. Once you break the ice it would be easier to see how far you guys want to go. Play it by ear from that point. He was checking you out so he must be attracted to you too. So be confident. Good luck!!!|`|eb8948e5d5553837d2b5cc6773615491aa	i think you must go and talk with him as may be he also is waiting when you wil come to talk with him. Better you make the first move and try to know what wil be his answer rather than waiting like this and may be one day you wil find someone else beside him as you were a bit late in talking with him.<br>  so wish ya good luck

Don't think this guy likes you or anything.   He just likes to give people hugs because he thinks it makes people feel better and it does!
vZCJOoZbaa	It would be weird, unless you wanna have sex with me... Otherwise it could turn me on, but depends who's doing it and again, it would be weird....|`|AA11436471	Shoot! Personally, if a woman fondles with my nipples in a very soft, sexual way, she'll definitely turn me on. My nipples are sensative, so if they're touched the right way, it arouses me like crazy. Also it depends what she uses to touch my nipples. Like if a woman ever uses her toes to touch my nipples, i't'll drive me to the point of no return. Woohoo!!
c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	Find  out  why  she  is  confused.  Ask  her  what  it  is  that  she  is  confused  about.  Can  you  help  her  to  clarify  her  feelings?

cf13d34f60b6830288053b1acdf4f674aa	How does the guy that treat you like a queen feel?  Does he give you excitement?  Butterflies in your stomach?  Obviously you are asking this question because you do really like Mr. Big.  BUT--always remember that we, as females, always want what we can't have.  Think really hard about what you want right now in your life.  Do you think you will really be still in love with Big after he decides to settle down with you; or do you think you just want that "victory" feeling you will probably get when he decides to not play hard-to-get anymore?  Some women realize that it was the game they were so into, not the guy after the guy decides to settle down.  THINK REALLY HARD ABOUT THAT-- and I am positive that the answer will be there for you.  Good luck, and have fun with life!!  I really do believe that everything happens for a reason-- and that Mr. Right could be Mr. Big... or Mr. Big might just be a stepping stone that you need to get past to be with Mr. Right, whoever he is.|`|AA11084868	It really depends on how you feel about this new guy and if you see a future with him.

INGENIERO<br>  <br>  El siguiente, es el levantamiento de datos realizado<br>  por un estudiante en Práctica de Ingeniería:<br>  <br>  Un semáforo cambia de estado, en promedio, cada 30<br>  segundos (treinta segundos en rojo, treinta segundos<br>  en verde). Por lo tanto, por cada minuto, un limosnero<br>  tiene 30 segundos de tiempo útil para lograr recibir<br>  un mínimo de $2.00.<br>  Con este esquema, en 1 hora de trabajo el limosnero<br>  habrá recaudad: (60 minutos x $2.00/minuto)=<br>  $120.00/hora.<br>  <br>  Si el limosnero trabaja 8 horas por día, descansando<br>  los domingos, da un promedio de 25 días por mes, lo<br>  que deja un ingreso de:<br>  (25 días / mes x 8 horas / día x $120.00/hora) =<br>  $24,000 al mes ?Será que ésta es una cuenta<br>  absurda...? Ahora bien $2.00 o $3.00 y a los mas<br>  generosos los he visto dar hasta $5.00.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, vamos a ser conservadores y asumir que en<br>  realidad el<br>  limosnero sólo recauda la mitad de la cuenta inicial,<br>  o sea: $60.00<br>  hora. Haciendo nuevamente las cuentas tendremos un<br>  valor final de<br>  $12,000.00/mes.<br>  <br>  Esto, equivale al salario promedio bruto de un<br>  supervisor de<br>  Ingeniería, que se desempe?a en una empresa de mediano<br>  porte (No hablemos de empleados al servicio del estado<br>  para no complicar las cosas); trabajando 48 horas<br>  nominales por semana, y aún teniendo que ir los<br>  domingos a resolver los problemas de mantenimiento y<br>  otros.<br>  <br>  De esta forma, cuando el limosnero recibe $5.00 (que<br>  no es raro),<br>  puede descansar tranquilo debajo de un árbol por lo<br>  próximos 9 cambios de luz del semáforo, y sin ningún<br>  jefe que lo moleste por causa de este descanso en medio<br>  de la jornada de trabajo.<br>  <br>  Pero hasta aquí todo es teoría... ahora vamos al mundo<br>  real:<br>  Con estos datos en mano, fui a entrevistar a una mujer<br>  que pide limosnas y que siempre va a cambiar las<br>  monedas en una tienda de barrio (a los bodegueros les<br>  encanta el sencillo) .<br>  <br>  Le pregunté cuánto ella recibía de limosna por día;<br>  ?Saben lo que me respondió...?<br>  Pues la cuenta inicial estuvo bastante<br>  aproximada:???Un promedio de $400.00 a $450.00<br>  diarios!!! Con esto nos queda un ingreso mensual<br>  de:(25 días / mes x $400.00/día)= $10,000/mes o de:(25<br>  días / mes x $450.00/día)= 11, 225.00/mes, lo que en<br>  promedio: da ???$10.625.00/mes!!! Y pero aún: ella me<br>  dijo que jamás llega a<br>  trabajar ni si quiera 8 horas diarias...ni tampoco los<br>  6 dias a la semana<br>  <br>  MORALEJA: Es mejor ser limosnero que trabajar como<br>  Ingeniero... pedir limosna es mas lucrativo.<br>  <br>  Ahhhh... ?y no pagan impuestos, ni ISPT, IMSS, ....<br>  ni han tenido que estudiar / practicar "X" a?os.<br>  Entonces, ?Tienes $1.00 que me regales?|`|Otdh4dJxaa	es sencillo el obrero gana un sueldo fijo  y asi se va a quedar por varios meses hasta que el gerente le de aumento pero aun asi, sigue siendo poco, ya que solamente es un obrero  te la pongo facil! un  obrero puede ser la mano de obra de un limonero  y de esta manera el obrero trabaja para que el limonero  pueda ganar mas dinero!|`|kD0Ts83Oaa	un obrero por que es mas duro el trabajo

Antes de contarselo a tu madre recoge pruebas, llamadas, fotos, imagens y restigos que certifiquen que lo que dices es verdad para que tu padre no pueda negarlo y explique lo que pasa. piensa en la persona que no sabe nada que es tu madre y vive en una mentira desde no se sabe cuando. ella se merece ser feliz al igual que todo el mundo. tu padre a lo mejor tampok es feliz pero es incapaz de romper la relacion por los a?os que llevan o por miedo , hazles un favor con el tiempo ellos te lo agradecerán. espero habert sido de ayuda|`|rTOlNB3laa	tenés que decir la verdad.|`|skKzgzNjaa	y si a nadie le molesta la actitud de tu padre.. porque me parece que de saber esto tendrías que haber reaccionado antes.. y tu madre obvio que lo sabe, estas situaciones de vidas paralelas siempre se saben pero se mantienen ocultas... por eso te digo que si a nadie molesta que siga todo como esta... sino la decisión que tomes siempre va a ser la correcta para vos (no quiere decir que lo sea para el resto)... pero actúa por tus convicciones... éxitos!!!!

Like my current situation, My ex-fiance was torn up about me and her breaking up. She started fooling around with an older man. Maybe 6 days after we broke up. I think it was kind of to make me jealous. She said it wasn't to hurt me or make me jealous, in my experience that means it was.  just to see if i would try for her, She texts me every single day. She want's to hang out alone with me some nights but say's she can't handle another relationship right now. I have told her since the day we broke up that i will wait for her if she ever wants me back. cause god know's i do. I said I will be her best friend and if she needs ANYTHING, i will be there for her. I will remain single until there is absolutly no way i can have her or until she comes back. i told her that the second day she broke up with me. I dont think i'm sending mixed signals here, I think she is the one doing that.
xE3c7mJ9aa	Hola... mira, yo opino primero, dos cosas... la primera es que considero altamente improbable CONOCER bien a alguien via chat... mencionas que te sientes capaz de dejar todo por este romance, pero creo que eso es sólo el resultado de que en tu matrimonio no te has sentiDo agusto y por eso te has creado esta "fantasia"... la segunda cosa es que si sientes que tu matrimonio no tiene arreglo, esto debe ser  totalmente independiente de otras personas y relaciones... arregla tus problemas ( llámese reconciliación o divorcio ) antes de pensar en meterte en otra relación... tienes que pensar muy bien y analizar a plenitud tus sentimientos y determinar si en verdad quieres terminar con tu esposo o darte una nueva oportunidad con él... y después pensar en una nueva vida y si tu nuevo romance vale la pena, tendrás que conocerlo bien primero... y conocerlo bien significa BIEN.... y no trates de auto enga?arte... muy en tu interior sabes que conocer a alguien es un proceso largo y que implica voluntad y compromiso por parte de ambos... Ahora... mencionas que te preocupa la opinión que tu madre tenga de ti... no sé que edad tengas... pero si ya eres una mujer casada... tu madre y familia entera DEBERAN aunque no les guste, entender que ya eres un adulto y reservarse sus opiniones... si tu madre no es capaz de escucharte y aconsejarte sin juzgarte y criticarte, creeéme que es mejor que estes lejos de ella... una persona así no sólo no te ayuda sino que te hace mucho da?o.... Si me lo permites te diré que lo fundamental es que hagas un análisis de que  realmente es lo que quieres y si quieres que tu madre y familia te traten como dulto, pues comportate como uno.... descubre tus propias respuestas y vive en consecuencia de ellas y de tus decisiones.  Yo te diria que hables con tu esposo... que le expongas tus verdaderos sentimientos... háblale de las cosas que te hacen sentir bien con tu romance... quizá él entienda y este dispuesto a darte eso mismo, que finalmente son cosas y detalles que se van perdiendo con lo cotidiano de un matrimonio... pero si dice que te ama... él puede estar dispuesto a darte eso mismo y renovar su relación... ahora que si en verdad ya no deseas estar con él, igual háblalo con él y lleguen a un entendimiento.  Respecto a tu nuevo romance, yo te dirá que te fueras con pies de plomo... cuando una mujer se siente defraudada por una relación, es facil que se involucre IRRACIONALMENTE en otra creyendo encontrar en otro lado las cosas que ya no se tienen..... yo no digo que tu romance sea mala persona, pero definitivamente estas propensa a IDEALIZAR a una persona que tiene tantos defectos como cualquier otra.... idealizar va en función de algo muy simple... justificar ante ti misma una decisión.... es decir:   "dejo a mi esposo porque este nuevo hombre SI me entiende y SI me hace feliz".... y si después las cosas no salen bien tú solita te podrás decir a ti misma: " es que yo pensé que era lo mejor".... es una forma de curarte en salud... tomar decisiones no es facil... y asumir las consecuencias de esas decisiones menos facil....  Yo te diría que te fueras a tomar un café contigo misma... o vete de fin de semana tú sola a estar contigo pensar y sentir.... comunícate contigo y descubre que quieres hacer.|`|e952b99083247ffc101f89be6268eae0aa	O sea estas ilusionada con alguien del chat?

Realmente has caído en las garras de la red y a veces suele ser un tanto dificil regresar y que esté todo bien. Las relaciones por internet yo las comparo mucho con el famoso "síndrome de Estocolmo". Es decir dos personas se encierran cada día en un mundo virtual y allí conviven un tiempo hasta que caen en la trampa de creer que se han enamorado. El cautivo se "enamora" de su secuestrador, de eso trata aquél famoso síndrome.  Pero en todo ese tiempo que ha durado "esa relación virtual" lo único que ha sucedido como real, "es que tu mente ha escuchado lo que quería escuchar". Y ha caído en la trampa del embelesamiento por el otro. De ninguna manera considero que eso sea amor y muy posiblemente termines entristecida por dos perdidas futuras. Y mientras suceda esto, lo llamativo es que tu mayor preocupación sea tu "reputación" y no la búsqueda de tu felicidad.  Lamentablemente la respuesta que buscas solamente la dará el tiempo, pero si deseas una respuesta de "bar" me atrevería a decirte que lo mejor sería "alejarte" de ambos hombres. Pues uno no ha hecho más que decirte lo que deseabas escuchar, y el otro no ha hecho nada para evitar que tú cayeras en este tipo de trampas, muchas veces con un retorno enormemente infelíz para tu salud síquica. Un abrazo.|`|b0f43afcac2b10430bfb4402ee5e9465aa	Si te casaste con tu esposo fue por algo y lo más importante es el amor que los une, si tu esposo te demuestra que realmente te quiere creo que no tienes que andar buscando por otro lado y lo mejor es que uds. dos hablen y solucionen sus problemas o bien pueden ir con un psicólogo a terapias de pareja.|`|h6dhT9REaa	Mira amiga un consejo, los amores de internet NO FUNCIONAN.  Trata de resolver los problemas con tu marido si lo amas. No dejes a tu marido por otro si tu marido es bueno.  Mira cuando tu dejas a alguien por otro ese otro te deja y juega contigo y lo peor es que cuando te arrepientes ya es tarde.  Algo así le pasó a la ex de mi novio, ella lo dejó por otro y ese otro la hizo sufrir, cuando se arrepintió ya era tarde, ahora mismo las parejas que ha tenido ella luego de eso han jugado con ella.  PIENSALO NO DEJES IR LA FELICIDAD DE LAS MANOS SI TU MARIDO ES BUENO NO LO ABANDONES.

Si inicia una relación con alguien así, en algún determinado momento va pensar que ella le tiene que ense?ar todo lo que sabe a él (y eso puede variar dependiendo de la experiencia que tenga ella), eso es bueno porque lo va amoldar a su forma de ser y malo porque a veces uno no quisiera estar de maestra.<br>  <br>  4.

I know a bunch of kids your age (trying not to call you a kid or anything but you are still really young) might being having sex, but that is because they think they know what they are doing, but they really dont.  There are major consiquences for your actions, whether you think your actions are right or not.  Pregnauncy, HIV, AIDS, etc I dont think you would want any of that right? I mean you only 14.  Plus, he is going through that start of the sex age, were there minds are going nuts, down there minds.  I mean all guys thinks sex 24 /7 but when you just start getting those feelings I think it is even worse.  Sometimes they think if they do it once it will end for a little white but when really they just end up wanting it more and more after that.  I would just tell him that you only like him as a friend, he should understand, plus tell him you are only ready for sex just yet.  I mean hey in a couple years go for it.  But at least wait till you are 17.  Please, we do not want anymore young teenagers having babies, and parents taking care of them, because they are to young to get jobs, and blah blah blah.  :)  Good luck!  HE should understand either way, if he is that good of a friend.  :)|`|Cbe8a8bcaa	If you dont want to then tell him, and just dont!!! You are only 14 you have your whole life for sex!!!!|`|Tqq0CUA6aa	He is not much of a friend, he only sees you as a piece of ***|`|XcKNgmMiaa	just be truthful but nice and make sure he gets what your saying, also be firm in what u say so he will know ur serious and u mean what u say|`|laEg5LYbaa	Do not have sex with this person.<br>  Make sure that when you do have sex it is for all the right reasons, and the person is very special in your life.<br>  Oh yeah, forgot to mention - you are WAY TO YOUNG TO BE HAVING SEX.  YOU SHOULD BE CONCENTRATING ON YOUR HOMEWORK AND NOT THINKING ABOUT HAVING SEX.<br>  Sounds like you are going to have sex sooner or later, so make sure you have protection.|`|nH7oKYIcaa	Dont do it! Specially cause of your age. I am a teenage girl myself(18 years old- yes I'm legally an adult, but lets face the fact, we're all still kids for a while after you turn that legal age). I havn't had sex & I have lots of boyfriends & flirt or whatever, but I havnt had sex because I'm not in love & dont want to throw my personal morals away. My mum has told me if I really want to I'm allowed to have sex or 'fool around' but come to her first & get on the pill. But I dont want to. I know that I want to save myself for someone worth it, & if he really is a friend of yours then he shoudl realize you dont want to have sex or engage in anything sexual with him. Your just a kid, like me.. & its not right of him. He might seem like a best friend to you, but sweetie, hes no friend of your if he's trying to purswade you into something like that. He's just a horny little boy who wants to have some fun. Listen to that song by Pink- you & your hand. It might make you feel better. He needs to learn how to simulate himself or something, because he shouldn't be going around asking his friend[s] (or anyone in he age group- which I'm only assuming that if he's one of yoru best friends hes in your age group as well) to have sex or something like it with him. You'll regret it so much afterwards. I know this for sure! One of my BESTEST friends had sex with her boyfriend of nearly a year and a half(& remember I'm 18, she is 17, so its more morally exceptable that your age is..) & she loved him so much. But they want he talked her into having sex with him, sorta like your firend is doing with you, made her feel like (at the time as they we're on the bed & he was inside of her..) she was being rapped. She told me in confidence, but I'm telling you this, because she wont ever know & I want to help you. She didn't feel like it was fun or anything. & she cried afterwards & a few weeks later he wanted to have sex with her again & she let him think it would feel different but it didnt.. her love for him is still strong, but she just doesnt love him like she originally thought she did. DONT DO IT SWEET HEART! You will only feel horrible afterwards. Its enevitable for sure! I think she should consider all the facts & look into him as a person more. If he was a real friend to you he would realize you are not interested & want to actually love or like the person more than a friend before you engage in sexual activity. Trust me, you will be greatful towards yourself later on in love. I wish you the best of luck & know you will make the right choice for yourself. If you would like to talk more about this you can email me at losurf24@yahoo.com My email is set to private from yahoo!answers so you wouldnt be able to find it any other way besides me telling you, because I understand what yoru going through & would love to be able to help you through this situation. Im an awesome listener, I really am. Any time that you feel like you need an older person to talk to, I'd definatly help you out. Good luck!!! <3

7cXJrP6Saa	Playful flirting is fun too, but you must know the guy first so you wont come on as... well, too eager. After a while of jocking around and talking, that is when the best flirting begins.

Too much staring makes you look like a creep. <br>  <br>  Smile if the two of you do make eye contact, but again, don't get carried away. <br>  <br>  Show off a little (only a little). This could mean walking past the person you're interested in, even though they are out of your way. Or it could mean dancing well. It depends on the situation. <br>  <br>  Initiate a conversation with the person if you don't already know them. Simply introduce yourself and get their name. <br>  <br>  Give the person your complete attention, or he'll be annoyed. <br>  <br>  Laugh at their jokes, listen to their stories, and don't get distracted by what's going on around you.Show lots of interest. <br>  Compliment the person. Tell them they look nice. It has to be true, though. <br>  <br>  Focus, sit up straight, look at him, put your feet on the floor, and rest your hands on the table or your lap, and lean forward slightly.<br>  <br>  Use playful but non-sexual touching. It helps break a "personal space" barrier. But pay attention to red flags, because a lot of people have "personal space" issues and you don't want to make them uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  Smile. It's contagous.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tips <br>  Whatever approach you use, be confident and friendly. If you think of the other person as a good friend of yours, then you shouldn't have any problems be confident and avoiding nervousness. <br>  <br>  Never seem too into someone; it ruins any attractive mystery you may have about you. At a point, it is best to back off and see if they are interested enough to pursue the relationship themselves. <br>  <br>  Make sure that they do not already have a significant other, and that their sexual orientation 'includes' you.<br>  <br>   <br>  Warnings <br>  Use flirting that is appropriate for the setting. For example, too much playing around in a library isn't proper.|`|7ur1vrg0aa	Ask him if he has a bandaid, becuase you scraped your knee when you fell for him.|`|Arv3c3NYaa	Flirting Tips:<br>  * Focus outward. Keep your attention outside yourself, toward a particular flirting target or toward the general social environment. You can't flirt while you're self-absorbed. <br>  * While flirting, follow up with a helpful comment. That helps them know you are kind, not just light-heartedly rude.<br>  * Body Language: Straighten up, good posture, shoulders relaxed, arms uncrossed, lean forward slightly.<br>  * Have fun. Be playful, light-hearted and spontaneous. Show your vulnerability.<br>  * Compliment. Compliment your flirting partner. The best compliments have the element of surprise. The "flirtee" will know that you really noticed them. Remember, your compliments must be honest, sincere and genuine. When you receive a compliment the best response is merely to say Thank You!<br>  * Use your eyes. Whether in conversation or across the room, look at your target's eyes a little longer than necessary, and keep a small smile on your own face while you do that.<br>  * Smile. It is contagious. It will make you so much more approachable. A smile lights up your face and draws people to you.|`|a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	I read an article a while ago on how to flirt.

After a while, it'll come natural and you can begin to act flirty, and then tell him how you really feel.<br>  If you want to be flirty, just sit close, and compliment him.

dLkn4VZjaa	Being sexually abused is a pretty hard thing to get over. I have alot of respect for you, you seem like you are a great woman, with a good head on your shoulders. I am not sure how you are, and I was not sexually abused, I was raped twice. I am sure you have talked to him about this issue, when I am uncomfortable about a situation the way I handle it is to talk through it. My boyfriend of 2 years now is wonderful. I am currently disabled due to strokes and seizures, they aren't controlled by meds yet. He cares for my daughter and I. I am 24 btw. Have you tried a bit of counseling? I think maybe if yous BOTH went. You could discuss that topic together and the counselor might have some really good advice for both of you. I think it is great that he is willing to wait, that makes him a very good man, he is understanding, and really cares about your needs and fears. Also it may take a bit of time. Mind if I ask how long you have been in a relationship with this man? If yous work together  you might not get "rid" of it, but as a team  you might be able to overcome it. You seem like a very strong woman, I am sure you can do it with a little help and comfort. I do wish you all the luck, and I am very sorry you had to endure that. I am sure it was difficult and still is difficult for you. Take care, and you can e-mail me as well. I am home all the time. Thankyou for reading this long message :P|`|0b6a417126e4e095cb0ff211401dc89baa	You should find a therapist who specializes in helping sexually abused clients.  To find on try calling the local rape hot line, or a battered women's shelter.  I think that the fact that your boyfriend will wait for you means that you have found a good one.  Good luck.|`|AA10789393	you cant really get rid of it because you will always remember it but if he is being very understanding then you should trust him to make you feel better about making love to him. Just think when he say i do he really loves you and he will not hurt you he is there to make you happy and make you feel good pretty soon you will realize there are some bad people in the world but he isnt one of them and you will feel much better|`|AA11471700	You never said what you are afraid of? Think you may need professional help with this--- good luck|`|e7e8af5636e271de414fe758d065a8f8aa	I'm very sorry you were abused, but dont let it keep running your life. Dont make the fact that you got abused apart of who you are. Your boyfriend loves you very much from what you wrote to wait until your ready. You gotta trust your boyfriend, im sure he wouldnt do anything to hurt you.|`|bRsTFGeZaa	If you love him and trust him then that right there should make it easier. Just your first time ask him to be gentleand take it slow.  Don't do the rough sex until you are comfortable. Your boyfriend sounds like a very understanding man, so I'm sure your first time will go well...

ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	To do what you feel is right for you no matter what any one else thinks, takes courage. Otherwise, you are only a shadow of a person who does what others dictate and say how far you can jump. As I can understand how it is to want to be popular, but you are only being part of a group, you are not being true to yourself and lack courage to have your own mind. Why not be special, dare to be different, dare to stand up against those shallow friends of yours and say, "I march to the beat of my own drum". Maybe they will not accept this, but so what? You might just be an example of what it really takes to be a person who has substance, courage, a true armour of love for themselves. I do hope my words are not being heard by deaf ears, but even if my words do not help you today, maybe one day down your years of your life you will think of what I have told you and understand. Best of luck to you!|`|4d5fpE7Eaa	talk to the guys best friend or just do what you want if yo want to start seeing him start seeing him dont let your friends decide!|`|EFA75En1aa	you DEFINITELY shouldy care what your friends think..listen if you like this guy then go for it..chances are your friends will look up to you for taking that step in dating someone "dorky"|`|NjSNbbavaa	WORRIE LESS ABOUT WHAT OTHERS THINK AND MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK! u shudnt let peoples opinons change how u feel. if u like him go for it|`|zvDXhj3Uaa	Dont be so high on your horse, life isn't a popularity contest, and if you really like this guy then you should go for him, regardless if he is a dork or not, Try not to be so shallow, and trying to use guy's for your own personal gain.|`|csnpTWYyaa	I don't know how old you are maybe in high school, but let me tell you that if you like this guy then hang out with him. Don't worry about what other people think because when it comes down to it the only one who can make you happy is you. If your " friends" make fun of you ..then trust me they are not your friends because that's not what friends do. If they  are truly your friends then they would not worry about a popularity contest they would be happy if your happy. Do what you want because it's your life not your friends life. The most respected people in the world got that way because they did not care what other people thought of them and lived their lives how they wanted.|`|s4DtKd7Vaa	It's kinda sad to me that you worry what others think, if you like this guy ask him out, you never know, he may be your soul mate. God Bless and good luck.|`|130dba6dd4565d3d900d63269b7ab29baa	If you care so much what your friends think, confront them about it. Ask them what they think about so & so. See what they say. If they are great friends, they wont care who you date, but if they are shallow popularity seeking girls, then they will probably disown you as a friend. Good news there... you'll know who your true friends are. Good luck

Simplemente dile que no te gusta como tú a él, o que no quieres seguir con él, porque vais por caminos diferentes... <br>  <br>  Es muy dificil, pero debes decirselo cuanto antes y tambien te aconsejaría que se lo dijeses convencida y intentando que él no vea ventanitas abiertas, porque sino intentará  conquistarte de otras formas y puede ser muy doloroso para los dos ya que siempre habrá negativas por tu parte.<br>  Sobretodo déjaselo claro, sufrirá pero acabará haciendose a la idea, en cambio si le dices que te lo tienes que pensar, vas a tenerlo comiendose la cabeza si ya te lo has pensado o necesitas mas tiempo..... y será peor porque guardará esperanzas de volver.<br>  <br>  En fin; diselo cuanto antes y sé concisa sobretodo.<br>  Un beso suerte!|`|ptRpoC0yaa	No es bueno noviar mas de dos anos. ten cuidado!

05c2856b3598ce21df8a5a37e225e4a9aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I am Romani.  Of course I have!<br>  <br>  I feel that you are getting ready to get yourself in some trouble.  I gave you some advice in another post.  I am going to copy and paste some of it into this one:<br>  <br>  If you chat up a Romani, or a group of us, just because that person is Romani, that person might not be to be too friendly (depends upon the person). We get MANY Gadje who are "Gypsy-groupies". We have a not very nice word for them in Romanes.<br>  <br>  If you DO want to do this, do not come up to us with the "I'm a Gypsy because I LOVE Gypsies" attitude (I do not know if you have that) because that is a way to REALLY piss us off. You are Gadje (non-Romani) and talk to us like people. Ask about our culture and be respectful. I notice that you are asking about us on Yahoo Answers. Approaching us with some knowledge (which you are trying to get here) is always a good thing!<br>  <br>  Another thing... avoid the word "Gypsy".  If you want to show us that you know what you are talking about, call us "Romani" please.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Gadje Gadjensa, Rom Romensa" (Gadje with Gadje, Rom with Rom) is an old Romanes saying and it is still true, to a degree, today. It is not so much in America, but in EU it is very prevalent.<br>  <br>  You are going to have a harder time identifying a Romani because we do not all dress in the stereotypical ways most people assume we do.|`|594003c4c20be1518753b6736ea84fc9aa	You do realize tht gypsy is a slang term for Egyptian??  A "gypsy" girl, I would assume, would be no different than any other girl.|`|zvDXhj3Uaa	Yes, i said once "do not fear me gypsy, I only want your tears to protect from A.I.D.S."|`|x5MDsfCEaa	YES I KNOW ONE....<br>  <br>  BORAT SAGDIYEV.......CONTACT HIM.....HE LIKES YOU....YOU LIKE HIM?

AA11109728	Nope - cut all ties, as you have already found out.  Third time is NOT a charm in this case!  It doesn't work out.  There's nothing decent enough about any of my exes worth having a friendship or ANY type of relationship with for that matter!  Someone ends up using someone in any case...|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	It never has worked for me to be friends with my exs.|`|45b994300f3e01ecfea172a605cb2517aa	I've found that keeping in touch with exs, even if only saying hi occasionally, is incredibly problamatic if you're in a relationship.<br>  Also, even if you're not in a relationship it tends to be very difficult. Often times I find that one of you still has feelings for the other.<br>  Other times you think you're over it all but you talk to them and they may mention a new love interest and BAM instant jealousy.<br>  It's not a fun thing.|`|9J2Ni7lBaa	being friends with your ex's causes to much drama for your nesxt relatiomship<br>  <br>  i mean if your girl/boy is ok with you being friends with your ex then so be it<br>  <br>  but just form person experience i know that my man being friends with his ex dosnt do me any good in my realtionship.|`|AA10084288	No, just do as I do.  Disappear, go cold turkey.<br>  Unless you have kids together, I personally see no reason to even ASSOCIATE with exes, period.  Good or bad breakup is irrelevant.  There's no reason to even talk anymore.<br>  <br>  Me personally, when a girl breaks up with me, I don't get mad or upset to her, I just cut off all contact with her and move on.  Trust me, you're better off never associating with him or her anymore.<br>  <br>  I know it's a gamble, but you're better off moving on, forgetting about them, just write them off as another zero.|`|zvDXhj3Uaa	Its not worth it at all... i guess guy's are a bit more fickle about this, but women don't seem to have a problem with it. I havent talked to my ex fiance in 2 months nor do i plan on it.  Its better that way, and when the time comes to re establish contact with her, I won't either, I don't need her in my life and she doesn't need me in her life, thats why she broke up with me and thats why i havent spoken to her or her friends. we don't need each other for anything.|`|b5664c2828d9033cded43bdd1e4f3bd8aa	u shul dnot cut the ties just dont be as close as u gise were before jsut be friends like hi ane bye hope this helped tc<br>  xoxoxoxxo
pPIIOVjsaa	What you should do, is in those classes just ask her questions about the subject, or maybe if she passes a paper back to you, thank you. "How was your weeked?" "Did you think that was a hard/easy test?" How did you do on that homework?" Those are unovbious questions, keep it to the subject your in, or maybe about the other class you have together. If you are polite, kind and funny, she will notice you. And you don't even have to be talking directly to her, you could be talking to the person next to you about something funny that happened that weeked and she might just listen into your conversation. And don't give up. Good luck :)|`|wSCtDmCWaa	Talk to her as friends? Talk about class or something, dont be afraid to talk to her, if you guys start talking and you have classes with her ask if she wants to study or hand out sometime. Get to be close friends with her then you can progress, i like when guys start to be friends first dont just jump up and attack. And dont worry about if shes popular or not, actully its nice to date other guys that your not always with.and average is good. dont worry be your self good luck
6z6CGDJhaa	it's going to hurt regardless of how you do it. breaking up always does. just be honest and make it a clean break. don't be wishy washy. he will hurt but in the long run he'll thank you for it.|`|d1998066e37208086b38c26695d09df5aa	If he loves you then you can't.<br>  If he doesn't then you can.|`|OkTQpUzZaa	Good question... Well, to start with, break up with him in person.  Don't do it over the phone or by e-mail or through another person.  Be honest with him.  Hold his hand while doing so - if he looks like he needs it.  Look him in the eyes and tell him you two had a great thing while it lasted, but you feel that it is time for the relationship to end and go separate ways.  Give him specific reasons if he asks.  The main thing is to be honest and sincere.  I think it will hurt him no matter what, but I'm sure he will definitely appreciate your being honest and breaking-up in person.

jGEKRpyVaa	be up front, but don't be pushy or hateful about it.  Calmly approach him and ask if you can talk to him about this.  If he resists, then perhaps he is having some issues in his life that he is not sharing.  Guys by nature do not open up as much as women.   Maybe his phone plan has a limit on text messaging and he is currently out for the month.

That may be a terrible means of communication for him.  If he's ignoring yours and writing others, then sure you can be mad.  But, if you're writing him 12 times a day, I could see why he may not be so into writing you back all the time.<br>  <br>  And yes it will be dramatic if you say "I'm mad at you for not answering my texts."  He'll immediately get defensive.<br>  <br>  What you can do, though, is talk to him.  Tell him your feelings; why you like to communicate with him, and how it makes you feel when you don't hear from him for extended periods of time.  Ask what his thoughts are about texting.  Be calm and rational.  Maybe you'll get a response-or at least a reason for his failures to answer.|`|6af08417dc9d86a96075aff0d5bb6ee8aa	If you are not "seeing" him...which it sounds like you are not and you are only messaging him...he is not responding...I would say he is spending his time elsewhere.

Al igual que tu, me invitaba a salir, me llama a diario, hablabamos horas y horas, me decia te quiero mucho, me tomaba de la mano, me abrazaba y cuando me besaba en la mejilla me sentia morir.

Ya van a ser 8 a?os desde que nos vimos la ultima vez. Y pues ya dejo de dolerme pues me di cuenta que si el no valoró mi amistad y prefirio alejarse pues no era alguien que valiera la pena. Y hoy en dia me doy cuenta q en realidad no era amor. El amor verdadero lo encontre donde menos lo imagine y soy muy feliz.

Bueno amiga espero lo pongas en practica dicen que una buena defensa es un buen ataque.Mucha suerte PAZ|`|TnOThN0Caa	Pues sí está muy raro el hombre, quiero darte un consejo, no sé si lo consideres bien ó mal, ?porqué no le pones un investigador privado?, yo creo que él tiene sus amantes, porque ?cómo se supone que es tan frío contígo y se la pasa viendo pornografía?, que no te cuente amiga, además un hombre que ama a su esposa ?cómo vá a rechazarla porque está amamantando a su hijo?, ?siempre ha sido así de poco frecuente para el sexo desde antes de casarse?, tú bien sabes que un hombre que te ama no evade que lo acaricies, piénsa lo que vas a hacer, no sé si quieras seguir así el resto de tu vida, ya tienes dos hijos que se merecen vivir en una familia llena de amor y tranquila, espera los resultados...|`|dd03d0458da10f30c02be05f843d7833aa	no te angusties, espera a que asimile bien lo del nacimiento de tu bebé, a la mejor siente bastante fuete la responsabilidad de una familia, ya que los gastos aumentan mucho.<br>  <br>  tu sé cari?osa como siempre y no te descuides, ya lei que bajaste de peso y te felicito.<br>  <br>  por lo pronto trata de no embarazarte, porque si él decide irse te las vas a ver muy dificil con los gastos anque te pase la pensión alimenticia.<br>  <br>  si ves que va tu matrimonio por mal camino, mejor ponte a estudiar o a poner algun negocio que te de seguridad económica, no decidas nada hasta que tengas esta parte segura.|`|dfadb13826f04071baf0bfaa2871b9aaaa	Mija kisas entienda komo te sientes!!!<br>  lo k yo te akonsejaria esk se dieran un tiempo hablaras con el y se dieran un tiempo pork la unik k esta saliendo lastimada a ki eres tu puesto k el al parecer le da igual todo el ha perdido el deseo sexual siempre he dicho k kuando se pierde eso las kosas despues salen mal...<br>  Una mujer puede salir adelante con sus hijos aveses mucho mejor<br>  kisas estes prokupada por ellos pero mira bien el kuadro k le ense~naras a tus hijos <br>  y la vida k kieres vivir.<br>  solo te deseo suerte y k hables con el pork eso es dificil...|`|ptCyxkMwaa	Me parece algo grave, los hombres, (sin generalizar) son mas afectos al sexo que las mujeres, y si el no quiere tener relaciones contigo, y solo pone pretextos, probablemente sea porque ya tiene lo que necesita en otro lado, yo si te recomendaria que hables con él sinceramente y consideres seriamente la idea de la separacion|`|qiE1fCaaaa	por favor si cruelmente, estas loca definitivamente si, o crees que esas acciones demuestran que alguien esta perdidamente enamorado de ti, puros pretextos  ya obtuvo lo que quizo y quiere probar otras mieles.
cpsPPLW3aa	have you tried simply saying hello?? Try inviting a few people to all go out together to do something, like go carts, or laser tag oe something that a group can do all together.  That way you will get her away from school and possibly be able to start a friendship and then maybe a few sparks will fly and something else will come out of it.|`|Fb4Z9Z9iaa	if you just want to be frineds with her because she is hot dont so that but if you really be friends just talk to her.|`|AA11280668	tough luck man, doesn't happen in this reality|`|AA11850481	just start talking too her and be like wats up and get too know her..........|`|AA12062714	you could ask her how she is doing. how her day is going  and if she is in to clubs or sports or whatever ask her how thats going for her... things like that|`|myxRsswlaa	Well, I'm a girl and I would want you to say: Hey! What's up? <br>  For the first time talking you want to keep it simple and make sure that you don't get too personal before she even has a chance to say hi.|`|cMlByAhIaa	i would comment her, ask your friend about her. like her interests, like if she likes music. Ask her her favorite bands. exc.|`|f13zLrjDaa	First of all, don't sound so desperate. I would try and talk to her on myspace first, it will tell you weather or not you have chance. Comment her, If she comments you back, at least she noticed you. Then talk to her in person. It doesn't really matter what you talk about, make it something she'll remember though.|`|lHvZzyRJaa	If the only reason you want to be friends with her is because she's hot, then thats no reason at all! Become less shallow and maybe she'll talk to you more.|`|mTgPk2jcaa	ummmm just because she didnt comment you doesnt mean anything she might not have time.... leave her pic comments  grls love it when they get complemnts ... then you need to just start talking to her. all i can say is dont be shy just flirt!|`|oXolZgYjaa	she too good 4 u,<br>  kisses,<br>  me
Fb4Z9Z9iaa	no pick up lines just be your self. ?|`|HwUv1PqVaa	Roses are Red;<br>  Violets are Blue;<br>  I like spaghetti;<br>  So let's F***
PhMohKAMaa	i don't want to be sexiest, but girls really shouldn't ask the guy out.|`|OkTQpUzZaa	First of all, you seem like a nice girl.  If you believe he thinks you are crazy, he is not worth your time.  Just because you almost had a nervous breakdown, does not make you crazy.  Everyone goes through a lot of stress in life, and nervous breakdowns can be good for some.  Okay, back on topic - please don't pursue this guy.  Find a guy who will respect you and will not think bad of you.  This guy is changing schools anyway... And finally, since I am old-fashioned, I feel that we females should be pursued, not be the pursuers.  I feel it is bad whenever any girl has to run after a guy who does not like her back.  I have fallen into this before, and I would like to prevent other females from doing the same.  So please, if this guy does like you, let him come to you.  If he doesn't, wait for a better guy to come along.
AA10817873	Note: do any one of these!<br>  1. Ask him if he has any messanger on the internet so you can talk to him afterschool. <br>  2. See him in the hallways and talk or talk at lunch. <br>  3. Send notes in class.  ( JUST KIDDING! YOU'LL GET CAUGHT! COMING FROM A GIRL WHO DID!) <br>  4. Talk to him through your eyes , (Not like your eyes have mouths but like when he looks at you, look at him like your saying something to him. like hi! or something) <br>  <br>  I hope this works!|`|Fb4Z9Z9iaa	just go up and talk to him when you get free time.|`|AA11280668	walk over to him before or after class. plan what you're going to say. invite him to watch a movie casually.|`|1a4362539b2195dfd01521529051640caa	You should get his number and just call once in a while to see whats up and talk.

I have a heart of marshmallow and am constantly being a cushion (soft landing).  I have not met such cold hearted people but they must exist given the divorce rate and the number of unhappy people in the world.  I guess the guy is just a good actor. Very closed with his real feelings. Possibly someone who can fake love actually can't really feel love so he mimics what he sees around him.  Probably speaks a little too loud or over emphasises his concern but is easily distracted by bimbos or dudettes when they walk by.|`|njDS9sDuaa	love- i kind of "baby" the girl and always keep in touch and be sweet to her<br>  fake- communicate when needed only<br>  turn off?!- in love, there are no turn offs.. maybe you argue about something but you resolve it..

You know when the time is right, and when to say what you feel. PLEASE....we men want you to get to the point...forget the labor pains and give us the baby...LOL ..I know this is tough for you, but hang in there....it's the rejection you fear most...Get it out of the way so you both can move forward, or you can ready yourself for a different road in life....Take Care|`|02a7194944c452004409bbb7f62d76b0aa	get some glass balls and tell him|`|3fb16c5a7241a29114b64e4eec57bc3caa	YES I HAVE AND IM STILL DOING THAT..AND I LIVE WITH HIM..Im scared to tellhim how I feel cause I dont want to scare him off.|`|UbfInRP7aa	I should sit down and have a talk with them and tell him how you feel.|`|5iw9fJybaa	I agree tell him how you feel..|`|8JWWsHzvaa	Tell him.

Never refer to him as a bad seed....suggest a part time job for extra cash,or pay him for things  like mowing the grass,or things you would normally pay some one else to do like my son changes my oil for cash....i would normally have to pay to have it done..although you may be the back bone of you family...you stepson may need a little encouragement from you instead of discouragement...being a teen can be ruff....may be he doesn't know how to ask for things...remember make him part of the solution not the problem......|`|e223c2bcf2658ef052b9f50017d7fba7aa	Almost all teenagers are this way, and most of the time, people dont tend to find control over their attitude. Teenagers go thru that stage where they think theyre just too cool for their own good, and they think theyre above u. So they dont have the most respect for their parents or family. But in some situaions, its just how the kid has been raised - to think theyre above others. From what u have mentioned, Im guessing hes not been raised this way. So what u need to do is seriously sit down and talk to him. Any child that treats u or anyone else with disrespect needs to be talked to. My sister is a teenager, and shes a handful at times as well. Its just part of growing up, and most of them grow out of it. Good luck, though!<br>  <br>  ~Abby|`|nCNsiblPaa	well u should never yell at the teen because that just makes them more mad and they would just not listen espesially if you not related to him. sit with the teen and talk ask him what is it thats making them act the way they do and u never know he might tell u things.

L' unico modo per capire certi istinti, senza scomodare l'amore, é quello di saper ascoltare i propri pruriti sessuali. Il resto sono soltanto parole, legami dettati dal formalismo, dai compromessi, da certi automatismi convenzionali cui tutto é stato deciso e regolato attraverso leggi che non insegnano ad amare ma ad alimentare l' egoismo, la possessività, il concetto di proprietà, del controllo sull’ altro, della perdita della libertà.<br>  Come vedi , l'amore in tutto questo non c'entra affatto, anzi non menziona nessuna contemplazione sessuale. perché a questi bisogni psicofisici ci pensa madre natura la quale ha fatto le cose attraverso certi principi universali. <br>  Poi non riesco a capire cos' é che vi rimane difficile da capire, quando le vostre scelte cadono sempre nella persona sbagliata.

Hey, Piero, cos'è tutta sta "veemenza" nei confronti di una tenera creatura, che tra l'altro è del tutto una nostra nuova amica in questo "luogo"! Me la vuoi proprio "passare al tritatutto", prima ancora che apra bocca?! Per favore, abbi un po' di pietà, se non altro...  Non ti sembra di essere stato un po' troppo duro nei riguardi di questa ragazza, Asia, la quale ha soltanto chiesto un timido parere?!  E, come tu le hai sentenziato che continua a commettere gli stessi errori che commettono a volte le donne, come mai non ti accorgi che stai dando una pessima impressione del genere maschile ad una ragazza che, tutto sommato, non ha espresso la benché minima polemica nei nostri confronti?!  Prenditela con chi se le merita realmente certe cose, ma, ti prego, non sparare a casaccio, perché così rischi di colpire le persone innocenti!!! Se tu sei stato "scottato" da qualche donna, e questo lo si capisce molto chiaramente da come ti rivolgi ad esse, non andare in giro armato di mitragliatrice automatica, ti scongiuro; ...a meno che tu non voglia fare una "strage"!  Adesso io ti consiglierei di abbassare un po' i toni, di scendere un attimo dall'altare e di chiedere umilmente scusa ad Asia, poiché anche tu hai commesso un grave errore, che, non soltanto avrà fatto del male a lei, ma verrà sicuramente anche a tuo scapito. E, se non vorrai assolutamente saperne di fare questo gesto (...chiedere scusa ad Asia...) non sentendone ragione alcuna, vorrà dire che, per questa volta, lo farò io per te. Ma, stai attento la prossima volta, e, soprattutto, non farci l'abitudine, ché io non posso mica seguirti ad ogni passo, su ogni terreno ove tu vada a "seminare" odio e rancore! Ora con te ho finito, ricordandoti che Asia attende le tue scuse.<br>  <br>  Eccomi da te Asia. Prima di tutto ti porgo io le scuse (se non volesse farlo Piero in persona) per tutto quello che ha detto, e, soprattutto, per il modo con cui l'ha detto; ma tu non temere! Sono convinto che Piero non ce l'abbia affatto con te, quindi, in realtà è come se non ti avesse detto niente, in sostanza, perché, sicuramente, stava parlando con qualche altra donna (questo è "pacifico", ...si fa per dire...). Lascia perdere ciò che ha detto, che - lo so - è alquanto grave, ma perdona e, soprattutto, non commettere un altro errore, che consiste nell'attribuire a tutti gli uomini, e, soprattutto, al tuo compagno, ciò che dice uno che ha il "dente avvelenato" e che vorrebbe farti credere di essere un valido "rappresentante" del genere maschile; cosa, questa, che rimane ancora tutta da dimostrare, ed assai opinabile. Veniamo alla tua domanda, che, al contrario di certi miei colleghi, io ritengo molto interessante e, perché no?, anche utile per noi. Innanzitutto, io non credo proprio che esista una formula o una tecnica certa per stabilire se una persona ti ama veramente o no; altrimenti, le cose non andrebbero poi così male a questo mondo!, ...cosa ne pensi? Per questo, non credere che sia così semplice darti una risposta in questo caso; ed io, fossi in te, diffiderei di chiunque voglia indurti a pensare di possedere la soluzione. Poi ci sono molti particolari che tu stessa hai omesso, e che sfuggono nella tua breve descrizione dei fatti, e che io ritengo invece molto importanti (ad esempio, il comportamento del tuo ragazzo, cambierebbe molto di significato a seconda del fatto che si tratti di un rgazzino giovanissimo ed inesperto, per non dire immaturo, anziché di un uomo più esperto e quindi senz'altro più maturo...). Ad ogni modo, adesso, tralasciando pure tutti i particolari e tutti quegli indizi che mancano nella tua descrizione, si potrebbe azzardare l'idea che una donna, o una ragazza, certe cose le avverta da sola, e senza alcuna formula o schema "razionale", ma semplicemente con la sua "intuizione"; e, ormai, è risaputo che questa dote è prettamente una prerogativa appartenente al genere femminile, e, questo, non ha nessunissimo bisogno di essere dimostrato, in quanto è un dato di fatto. Quindi, l'unico suggerimento che mi sentirei in grado di dare, è di cercare di acquisire una maggiore fiducia in te stessa (...cosa che, almeno dalle tue parole - quindi non posso esserne certo - è quello che mi è parso di avvertire.), e nelle tue risorse interiori. Vedi, secondo me, anche il fatto che tu ti sia rivolta in qualche modo (anche se non lo dici esplicitamente, ...ma ciò lo percepisco dal modo in cui parli del tuo ragazzo) più agli uomini che non alle donne, sembra essere una ricerca, la tua, al fine di ottenere in qualche modo una risposta del tutto "razionale", o, similmente, "scientifica". Ma tu, questo lo sai benissimo che non esiste, perciò, nasce una certa "insicurezza" in te, che non ti dà pace; però stai andando un po' "contro-mano" secondo me, e dovresti cambiare direzione. Affida ogni tua incertezza a quello che prova il tuo cuore, prova ad ascoltarti meglio, prova a crederti ad ogni istante un po' di più, e non soffocare le tue doti, le tue infinite risorse, che certamente possiedi, anche se non te ne rendi pienamente conto. Fatto questo, che non è poco, vedrai come tutto ti sembrerà molto più chiaro e limpido di quanto non lo fosse stato fino ad ora. Abbi più fiducia in te stessa, poiché tu la sai certamente più lunga di tutti noi messi insieme, in queste ed anche in molte altre cose. Grazie per la tua domanda. Ti saluto cordialmente.<br>  Ciao!|`|ihpZjbjqaa	non penso che è stato sincero.<br>  da quello che sono riuscita a capire le l'hai detto tu di dirti che ti ama e ciò non vale perchè forse in quel momento non se l'ha sentiva di farti una dichiarazione cosi emozionante e poi secondo me un ragazzo fa molta fatica a rivelare i propri sentimenti perchè non sono cosi bravi con le parole ( come l'ho siamo noi donne).<br>  comunque il mio consiglio non aspettarti da parte sua un TI AMO , ti puoi accorgere se veramnte sente qlc per te dal modo in quale ti guarda , ti accarezza, ti bacia ecc.|`|okqernI4aa	Cara Asia, forse è solo timido...

Her best friend is a guy and he is like 6 foot something. They look cute standing next to eachother messing around as friends.

I'm just kidding, I wouldn't worry about it, height shouldn't make a difference if you guys are really good friends.

BINukvGqaa	hey there! i am in the same situation. many guys that play on his baseball team tell me he likes me, but he hasnt come out and asked me to be his gf. but he texts me every night and tells me good night with a casual closing of "luv ya."  if this guy you are speaking of likes you, he is most likely trying to talk to you (if he already isn't) or make a special effort to show you he's thinking about you. right now, im waiting it out. most guys dont ask girls out not because they don't like them, but because they are scared of rejection. but if this guy truly likes you, he will take that chance and ask you out. it just might take him a while to plan it all out or get what he wants to say together! good luck!

Amiga Vida.<br>  O homem quando ama verdadeiramente, ele n?o traí, e isto eu falo por mim, agora aqueles quais dizem amar e traem, eu tenho dúvidas quanto esse amor, pois tal fato contradiz e em muito, isto n?o é um amor verdadeiro, tratá-se de um aglomerado de sentimentos, de uma mistura onde à po??o tende a diluir-se, s?o muitos que dizem amo, e você pergunta como é o amor? E eles n?o sabem lhes responder a altura, e sabe por que? N?o amam verdadeiramente, quantos e tantos ainda encontrarei assim, dizem terem perdido alguém que amavam, e seus porquês foram por trai??o, estampam nas faces arrependimentos, mas n?o demoram s?o atraídos por sexos opostos quais acabaram de surgir repentinos, secam-se os prantos, e lhes d?o o lugar os sorrisos, e só me resta analisar, e chego a triste conclus?o, perdoe-me o termo, mas, n?o choraram, creia, apenas urinaram pelos os olhos.<br>  Um forte abra?o.|`|fc9f3558499f81d447347723d4747460aa	Na opini?o deles, sexo nada tem a ver com sentimento, portanto, para eles, é possível amar e se envolver com outras mulheres.

Ocwjs9Qsaa	You have already contacted him twice, don't become a stalker.  He already invited you to do something, don't force anything.  The whole letter thing to his office is a bit odd.

Is he single?|`|AA10075012	nice story|`|41S2Hottaa	You might be reading into this a little too deeply. He's a doctor. Maybe he is busy. If you are wondering how he is feeling about the situation you need to confront him. Stop reading between the lines and looking for clues, just be straightforward. He's either still interested or he isn't, and you can find out by calling him. That's what adults do. Good luck.|`|dDDK2Lilaa	Hmmmm....what was the blog about??<br>  Maybe something in it freaked him out?<br>  <br>  I would try writing him back, something short, and see what steps he takes from there.

uROeXblraa	All I can say is that middle school is h-ll. You didn't do anything, most likely your so called friends found out you were moving and decided to dump you. They're probably all hurt that you're moving, presumably to a new place where they feel they'll never see you again. They're masking that hurt by dumping you and punishing you for leaving them. Forget these people and focus on school, moving, and your new school. I know this sounds dumb, but ignore them, or find a way to turn their taunts to your advantage (witty comebacks are the best...although you might feel guilty playing on their level). If this is confined solely to your old friends, make new ones. Honestly, if they're going to make you feel terrible, why waste your time with them?|`|Q0EFie5Laa	seems like young people your age seem to do this..like have a  designated person that gets all the guff...it will be someone elses turn soon..remember and think back..I bet you have seen this happen to someone else at some point,...and maybe even participated. Girls are mean to other girls..it is not nice...you guys should be pulling together not apart, because you need the nice friendships...<br>  u are moving? maybe they don't know how to show they will miss you, and so they are acting out in a in mature way...|`|cuJVKcGwaa	ignore every one and make new friends before you move|`|jl731juaaa	Sounds like your friends aren't your friends any more.   Sadly, this happens A LOT in junior high and the best, most encouraging thing to say is that things will get much better once you get into high school and even better after that.  The best advise I can give you is with regard to the teasers - take the teasing and just laugh it off as much as you can.  Don't let it get to you because people are just jerks at that age.  In addition, try to find someone who doesn't laugh.  This might be difficult because it is so late in the year, but maybe choose to eat with someone else at lunch one day.  Really you have nothing to lose by trying to make different friends since you are moving so soon.|`|c67834b2cd2e1dac076e88eb79238b04aa	If you're moving, then you have a chance to reinvent yourself wherever you go; use it to your advantage, and make new, better friends.|`|LAq8lHxDaa	The same thing is happening 2 me, only I am not moving. Someone that is upset,angety,or just plain irritated with you had spread rumors or told other people things you have not actually done. That is why I am having the worst last trimester of my life.

The difference is the amount of committment you have. This is in no ways related to sex I assume. Someone once said "Love is the cannibal that eats away friendship". I don't think so. True love strengthens friendship.<br>  <br>  So a friend is one who you gel with and have an emotional bonding with and would go to great lengths to keep it that way.  <br>  Friendship is the bond that exists between two people that feel a sort of contentment in doing things together and share a lot of things together.<br>  Love, is when you are happy just being around a person. You share much more than friendship. You are willing to risk your life for someone. or give up all you have or go against others that you love just to be with that person.<br>  <br>  I think biologically, it must be the amount of happy chemicals secreted in the brain when you meet/think of each other. The more the chemicals the stronger the feeling.<br>  <br>  A test was once suggested to me to find who do I love and who loves me.<br>  Think how many people will give their all to be with you. go against the other people in their lives (parents, spouses?,friends)<br>  These are the ones who love you.<br>  Think of a grave situation, a legal or money situation. <br>  Now how many people will stand by you?  These are your friends.<br>  <br>  Btw, The same applies to you.

I dont know what you are talking about, and I think this is kind of a stupid question for you to be asking. So what if only 3 guys talk to you on a regular basis, be happy you have 3, some dont have any.|`|LpEzlBQCaa	Hey what is up with this ugly talk? You are not ugly, I just looked at your pic. They say how women like confidence. Well men like that also in a woman. You definitely lack confidence right now in yourself. You can have contacts, or do different stuff cosmetically woith make overs and that could make you feel better about yourself, and then you will have the confidence that you are lacking. You work with the best with what you have. There are many "ugly" people who look like models but are bitches or jerks and no one really likes them. Confidence helps a lot. You have a good personality, some feminine charm, have walk and manner of confidence or "I'm sexy" vibe and guys will notive. It is called sex appeal. Just because guys  don't talk to you on a regular basis does not mean that they don't like you or think you are ugly. Guys can be shy you no. Or be preoccupied and being blind with people in front of them. But, you have an aura to you and guys will be like, who is she? And you will get noticed. The thing is, don't worry about it anyways. A lot of guys are dumb and immature in school anyways. So you don't want to be with guys just for the sake of it. If you have some confidence in yourself, you will attract a guy and he will somone for you.|`|OkTQpUzZaa	You are not ugly.  I looked at your picture and I will say you are what many of us are: average looking.  That does not make you ugly.  I will go ahead and guess that you have a beautiful personality, which matters far more than looks.  Are you good in school?  What things do you excel at?  I bet you are talented in many ways.  Do you have a sense of humor?  Can you laugh at yourself?  Gain some confidence in yourself - please stop thinking you are ugly.  Think about all the things you are good at, learn to relax and be comfortable with who you are and be yourself around people - believe me, guys will come running to you.  You will get a boyfriend.  Just work on loving yourself first.|`|iMLZwnOeaa	your not ugly'<br>  i think u are and average person|`|Zd649zkmaa	I'm sure your not ugly you probably jus haven't found ur best features or how to bring out your best features. hair, a touch of make up, the right style of eye wear, and style of clothes can make a considerable difference to ur appearance and ur confidence.|`|dcdF9Yx8aa	No girl is ugly. God made you the way you are for a reason and you should not take that lightly cuz he knows why he did how he created you and everyone is beautiful. I think you should wait to get bf until you find someone that likes you for who you are not what you look like.

52449e5700c5ecf7fa70289e6e585bbcaa	Love is a constellation of emotions and experiences related to a sense of strong affection or profound oneness. The meaning of love varies relative to context. Romantic love is seen as an ineffable feeling of intense attraction shared in passionate or intimate attraction and intimate interpersonal and sexual relationships. Love can also be construed as Platonic love, religious love, familial love, and, more casually, great affection for anything considered strongly pleasurable, desirable, or preferred, to include activities and foods. This diverse range of meanings in the singular word love is often contrasted with the plurality of Greek words for love, reflecting the concept's depth, versatility, and complexity.|`|f9e09894460237985b464302ee3fd22caa	love u is some thing that people feel for a person that is close to u u cant see it u cant taest it and u cant tuch it so love is what everybody wants and needs but it is hard to explane so that is what love is.|`|da254e148d14e8e63d10389a2330c7f0aa	You know what love is when you feel it. <br>  You will know once you feel it. Its the only way to really understand what love is :)

Don't wait for them to do it if it seems that they never do.  Don't assume that they're not thinking about you, I'm sure they do, but they have other things to deal with and that opportunity to call you passes by and they miss it.  <br>  <br>  If you want to chat with your friends you take the initiative and call them.  You don't lose anything by calling, and you certainly are setting an example to your friends about keeping in touch.  Invite them every time to call you when you call them.  At some point, maybe they'll start to feel guilty for not calling you that they'll finally feel compelled to call to feel good about themselves.  <br>  <br>  Don't play games with them by not speaking out about what you need.  If you need to talk and feel the attention of your friends, get it yourself.  You won't seem desperate and you won't seem any other way except a good friend for keeping touch and being conscientious about it.
idWX5TFvaa	ask one of her friends...right?|`|AA12303215	You are either going to have to bit the bullet and ask her, or keep wondering.

Good luck on whatever you decide to do.|`|4Ybxkdcjaa	ask her if she would like to explore a deeper more meaningful relationship with you.|`|jZyJfS8saa	the only way to know for sure.. is to ask her.. thats the only way to really know.. because.. if shes just talk to u.. and msg you wid no real hints.. its hard to say...  i know u dont want to risk ruin the relationship.. if she was not into u.. but what if she was and you still never said anything?? its better to have asked.. and get shot down..and still remain friends.. trust me.. u get ova the "wierd" phase.. and things will be fine.. if your still scared to confess.. then just get a good friend to ask her... or better yet.. ask her friend questions about her.. "what kind of guy do u like??" "do you like anyone right now" ....trust me.. girls talk.. and im sure she'll tell the girl u like.. what you were asking.. so if after that convo.. she shows signs.. then she's prob interested.. if not.. then sorry.. probably not

Mas e Deus o que pensa:<br>  Pois é meus amigos tem vários versículos na bíblia em que Deus a maior autoridade repudia tal a??o. em um versículo que diz que os afeminados ( na época n?o existia o termo gay e nem homossexual ent?o falava-se afeminados para se referirem a eles), está escrito que os afeminados n?o herdar?o os céus, e a quest?o é que existe vários outros versículos bíblicos que Deus deixa bem claro a sua posi??o quanto a esta manifesta??o endossando toda obra a lúcifer ( anjo *****) e suas obras espalahadas pelo mundo.<br>  Bem, as igrejas católicas e até mesmo as evangélicas n?o falam isto publicamente para n?o escandalizar mas pergunte a um padre o que eles pensam sobre o assunto e o que Deus pensam.<br>   Podemos até fazer olho grosso quanto a isto ( porque n?o devemos odiá-los mas sim amá-los como nossos semelhantes) mas n?o tem como adptar os coiceitos da bíblia com esta nova tend~encia como nossa amiga disse aí em cima simplesmente porque Deus n?o segue tend~encia e nem moda.<br>   Uma coisa é Deus ser AMOR, Ele perdoa ( perdoou a prostituda e pediu que n?o praticasse mais a prostitui??o que assim ela seria totalmente limpa e digna de ser aceita como uma virgem aos olhos de Deus) e outra é que Ele é JUSTI?A e diz que depois que a pessoa morrer e n?o mudar, se arrepender e aceitar a palavra de Deus, pois Ele dá liberdade de express?o á todos vc tanto pode ajudar ao próximo como matar que enquanto estivermos vivos Ele vai deixar as coisas acontecerem até que  decidam seguir o lado certo mas depois da morte existem dois lugares  para se viver com os anjos de Deus e áqueles que seguiram o lado certo e o mundo do inferno com os dem?nios e o grande principe das trvas que tormentará as pobres almas para toda eternidade.Muitos n?o acreditam nisso mas veja que decp??o será quando eles se depararem com tal realidade nesete mundo espiritual que é mais real que este nosso material pois o mundo material e físico é cria??o o espiritual é o autêntico e mais cedo ou mais tarde em algumas poucas dezenas de anos vc, eu e todos nós morreremos e viveremos toda uma eternidade junto de Deus ou junto do capeta. A escolha e o julgamento para isto será só de Deus e Ele já deixou claro o que pensa sobre os gays, afeminados, prosptitutas, lébicas, travestis e adulteros.|`|539270258a2b099d679d0208b6b2f0aeaa	Nada contra os gays...

ISSO é UM ABSURDO EU N?O SOU A FAVOR, DISSO ISSO é UMA BERRA??O, CONCORDO PLENAMENTE COM VC, Eles est?o com esse poder todo devido a tal de Martha Suplicir  que fez pela primeira vez a passeata dos gays em S?o Paulo ela encheu a bola deles e por isso est?o achando q est?o com essa bola toda.

N?o tenho preconceito pois sei na pele exatamente literalmente o sentido do termo preconceito. Mas é claro que n?o devemos odiá-los e sim amá-los e respeitá-los como o nosso próximo. E nem devemos jungá-losaliás aqui cada um tem uma opni?o e no final ninguém tem uma decis?o final sobre o assunto. Mas eu como um bom católico sei exatamente sobre a origem do homen e da mulher e qual foi os planos destas criaturas ( que somos nós) e sei perfeitamente o que Deus pensa sobre este assunto idependente do que o santo papa, os governos, os intelectuais, a onu, o fbi, os artistas e estrelas de cinema, os seus ídolos, os formadores de opni?o disserem só terá validade para influênciar as mentes humanas mas n?o para decir o que é certo ou n?o aos olhos da grande VERDADE. Deus condena esta sexualidade e nada melhor do que Ele decidir o que é certo ou n?o porque Ele criou a ra?a humana e será Ele que bate o materlo no final. Eles diz que os pecados ~existem porcausa de Satanás e suas legi?es. Ent?o nós da igreja  n?o vemos a homossexualidade como doen?a ou op??o mas sim como MALDI??O e que pode ser sim quebrado e o homem pode novamente ter atra??o para mulheres. Cabe a nós católicos e evamgélicos criarmos indepedente de conceitos religiosos institui??es para salvar estas pobres almas aflitas, assim como temos feito com os drogados e alcólicos. Esta institui??o seria feita para ajudar aqueles que querem largar esta vida é um alternativa bem bacana e deve ser levada a sério pois já ouvi dizer que existem vários espalhados pelo Brasil mas a mídia n?o divulga.|`|HOhW2yR0aa	N?o é quest?o de ser julgado mas de concordar ou n?o com estas baixarias.

Gra?as a Deus que os meus dois filhos já se casaram e amam suas mulheres é uma tremenda felicidade para suas m?es verem os seus filhos no caminho correto. Nenhuma m?e quer ver o filho perdido e neste caminho do homossexualismo. A família é um coisa maravilhosa e só se consegue isso quando há uma jun??o entre homem e mulher e filhos biológicos isto faz parte do ciclo da natureza e n?o tem como mudar podem até tentar mas sempre estar?o sem a raz?o e n?o tem como mudar. Por exemplo os animais seguem a mesma sistemática, vcs nunca ver?o um cachorro gay onde macho transa com macho e fêmea com fêmea. Só vê que n?o quer, a verdade sobre isso tá na cara. <br>  <br>  Ent?o vamos combinar um negócio para n?o gerar conflito vamos fazer olho grosso e fingir que concordamos depois no fim Deus jugará porque Ele sabe todas as coisas e é exatamente Ele que pode julgar e condenar.|`|y4EDcg5laa	SIMPLESMENTE ABERRA??O HUMANA!!!|`|yOvH8NVsaa	Com certeza devemos respeitá-los ou pelo menos tentar suportá-los, mas aceitar nunca é muito esc?nda-los e aberra??o. Tudo bem eu gosto do humor gay pela televis?o assisto e achos eles bem divertido, mas só ali nasquelas cenas e ponto final porque depois disso se formos acompanhar a intimidade os bastidores aí já suja total.<br>   é uma mistura de vulgar, com aberra??o, com escanda-lo bem eu adora a noite vou a baile e festas com a minha namorada e digo que incomoda e incomoda muito ver dois homens forte falando alto  com auqlas vozes estranhas se pegando ebeijando. Meu na boa eles n?o tem pudor nenhum, eles n?o tem disconfr?metro e o pior a cena é feia e mesmo que eu tente n?o ver o clima fica meio pesado. Talvés muitas pessoas n?o veem a cena que eu vejo constantemente nem eu que sou supre apaixonado pela minha namorada fa?o o que eles fazem. Gente em época de festas a noite eles n?o sabem se comportar, se eles quiserem abaixar as cal?as eles baixam e n?o tem verganha nenhum e os palvr?es que eles falam nem se fala até me assusto n?o pela palavra mas sim pela intensidade e altura com que eles falam.<br>  Vai ter aí a parada gay e a mídia vai mostrar somente o número do movimento e as fantasias das travestis e tudo colorido, alegre, enfeites, como se fosse um verdadeiro paraíso. Mas se vcs verem o que acontecem la′no meio vcs nem imaginam eles saem beijando na boca de cada um que se encantram . Eles pra ficar um com o outro n?o precisam nem pedir permiss?o apenas chega perto olha e beija e se agarra e isso acontecesse em toda festas entre os milh?es. Entendo um pouco a revolta do Romeu porque o negócio é feio de se ver. até pra pessoas mais liberais como eu o eu reprovo completamente a posi??o dos gays e travestis.<br>   Os gays excedem todos os limites e pra ficar um com os outros nem precisar saber seu nome. Vi na internet um vídeo de uma festa fechado com gays é a coisa mais fudida que já presenciei uns transando com os outros ali no mei da sala os outros olhando ouvindo música, bebendo, nem quando os jovens fazem festas mais absurdas com prostitutas isso n?o acontece. Realmente tem que ser discutido estas coisas e sou completamente CONTRA CASAMENTO DE GAYS. Sou católico também e seui que o papa e aigreja nunca v?o aceitar tal coisa embora leis de casamentos estejam sendo feitas e embora aja uma crise dentro da igreja com alguns homossexuais que se infiltram  e ficam sendo padres por medo da rejei??o da sociedade se escondem atrás da batina. Já os evangélico também s?o bem definidos em suas posi??es pois vi numa programa??o da igreja crente de madrugada em que um pastor deixou bem claro que leis de casamento gays estavam sendo feitas e que se o governo decidisse que a igreja deveria por lei  dar direito de casamento gay no religioso ént?o que ele sairia algemado para a cadeia mas que n?o faria tal uni?o em nome de Deus de homem com homem e mulher com mulher em hipótese alguma, aí já me senti um pouco mais alivido porque vejo que as religi?es crist?s concordam  pelo menos em alguma coisa.|`|ymjHTZ0jaa	Pelo geito vc deve ser um desses carecas que pregam a violência!!!<br>  Sou heterosexual, mas ergo a bandeira contra a homofobia...<br>  Vc ser contra é uma coisa, mas querer fazer justi?a à sua maneira hahahaha, vc n?o tem esse direito queridinho...<br>  Viva a sua vida e esquece os outros, porque a felicidade dos gays te encomodam???Será que vc n?o tem enveja deles????<br>  S?o poucos os casais homosexuais que se revelam publicamente, mas se vc conhece algum deveria aplaudi-los pois s?o pessoas corajosas, pois pra enfrentar uma sociedade preconceituosa como a nossa eles s?o dignos de admira??o e n?o de repudio...<br>  Queridinho domingo é nóis na PARADA GAY e qual o problema???
cmBPF5Ckaa	i bet it's a yes.<br>  <br>  most of the time, us boys just don't want to look stupid.  if i said i liked you, and you didn't like me back, i'd feel bad about myself.  by saying maybe, i'm not denying i like you, but i'm not admitting it.<br>  <br>  that way, i'm not getting my feelings hurt.<br>  <br>  maybe you should take the initiative, and approach him yourself?|`|LeQp4EN7aa	maybe means yes|`|d9e19a88d4f862215e32f72eee7a404aaa	he does but is scared to say|`|7752c6c3d980ebc7429b570e7cc20317aa	just ask him out and he'll say yes, then you guys will probobly do nothing at all ;)|`|Cd5avmhWaa	I'm going through pretty much the same thing right now and I know how confusing it can be. Maybe you should try asking him, or maybe getting to know him better and then feeling more comfortable around him before you ask him how he feels about you and let him know how you feel about him without weirding out the relationship as friends. If your guy friends say that he likes you one day and someone else another day than maybe he does like you, but likes someone else too. Everyone has liked more than one person at a time before. It will take some time to get comfortable with asking him and if he says no then it will take even more time to stay comfortable around him feeling the way that you do when you know that the feeling isn't mutual.  It can be hard but if things don't work out then you have to try to move on.|`|Y4KzhQniaa	He's probably just nervous. Try walking up to him and just straight out asking if what his friends say are true. I hope things work out ok. Good Luck.|`|AA12219236	I think u should just flirt around with him.

Cd5avmhWaa	I used to be the exact same way because I really liked my best friend, (but he didn't like me that way), I know that it can be confusing but if she is really your best friend than she will be your friend no matter what, and you liking her won't hurt the friendship at all. Trust her and trust your relationship with her and tell her. Hope that things work out for the best and know that a real friend will be your friend no matter what.
Cd5avmhWaa	I think that the best way to find out if she is still into you is to just ask her, but if you don't feel completely comfortable doing that than you can get some of your other friends to find out for you, by asking her. Or, you try talking to some of her friends to see of she is interested in you still, most of the time if her friends know you pretty well they will be pretty straightforward. good luck!

I hope I helped!|`|Cd5avmhWaa	Well you said that you have been friends with this guy for almost a month or something, but the question is: how long have you known the guy that told you all this stuff. It is sort of up to you who you trust more because you know then and you know who they are like. If you are really good friends with the guy that told you all that stuff then believe him because you should never choose some guy over a really good friend. But if you haven't known that guy for a really long time and you trust the boy that you like a lot because you really like him than trust him because he means more to you than the other guy.

La maternidad es un instinto que se desarrolla, cada una pensamos y hacemos las cosas de manera diferente. Platica con ellos y hazles entender que la ni?a por ser tan peque?a requiere de mas atención pues aun no puede valerse por si misma a diferencia de ellos que no requieren tanto de ti para atender sus necesidades basicas. Me parece que ese es el punto. Puedes organizar reuniones con los 3, juegos, salidas al campo, al cine o a comer. Los hijos cuando son adolescentes tienen otras inquietudes y dejan de ser afectuosos por estar en su mundo, pero no quiere decir que dejen de quererte, solo que se vuelven un poco egoistas, todo para ellos, es parte del crecimiento. Platica con ellos, la comunicación es la solución para los problemas y dificultades. Estoy segura que sabras como hacerlo, hasta ahora tu labor como madre ha sido buena, no necesitas de grandes consejos. Tu instinto de madre te guiara. Mucha suerte.|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	no he pasado por ahi no tengo hermanos<br>  siento celos por mi prima pero hice una comparacion de k ami me dan todo y a ella  no ella es una sobrina y ya|`|3b3020911a5d204e199a43df8a92a19eaa	convivir un poco mas con ellos, platicar con ellos de sus gustos, inquietudes, etc. que vean que realmente hay un interes en ellos, porque el caqri?o no es cuestionable.|`|27fcf44081bb9d29aa42879f59753be7aa	Mi mama estaba en la misma situacion y a mi y a mi hermana os lo hizo entender: el mejor consejo que ella nos explico es que poner limites, tambien es amor.

juRWvc0eaa	Ignorance is bliss. This girl is a slut, and you should run like hell. If you choose not to listen, at least make sure you use protection. Better safe than sorry.|`|3SApoQ9Uaa	That's a lot of people to have shared something so special with. I don't mean to be judgemental, but I do think that a woman needs to be more in control of the situation and not just sleep with every guy that she has some sort of "relationship" with. I have a lot of respect for you, being 34 and a virgin. I think that's cool that youre waiting to find the right girl. You should also do what's best for you. Past sexual experiences should be personal, but if you do do it...make sure you use protection after shes been with that many people.|`|iTkr3Lm8aa	Dont waste yourself with the slut!  And by the way, find some new friends to hang around. Cant imagine all the diseases floating around their bodies!|`|mPser4Liaa	How many sexual partners a woman has is no body's buisness but hers. It's okay for a man to have an unlimited list of how many sexual partners he's had but it's not ok for a woman? Why? Because she's a woman? Bull?<br>  Whatever someone did in the past shouldn't bother you. All that matters is what they do when you both are together. Once she has no sexually transmitted deasese and treats you with respect that's all that matters.<br>  It's about time men and women stop judging women for every little thing that they do.|`|zQjrCOW1aa	Well,what she's done in the past should stay in the past. But the question is if she was with you or even someone else who she cares about is she capable of being faithful? What was the reasoning behind all the guys she'd been with would be good information to know,  like was she just young and running free at the time and letting her hormones get the best of her or was she in a relationship while having sex with others. I wouldnt judge, i'd just be aware and know what your getting yourself into if you decided to date her.

Mas tem meninas que gostam que o cara fique atras dela só para se sentir "a tal", é assim: "gosto de vc como amigo, mas te quero por perto pra quando eu precisar, te usar", ninguém merece. Nem um homem e nem uma mulher|`|qkjQ4mG1aa	Você está errado garoto, o xavequeiro é um romantico, o cafajeste é aquele que xavéca todas e n?o fica com nenhuma.|`|yMzV4cZsaa	ah bem diferente ne,uma coisa eh lutar outra coisa eh xavecar um monte ao mesmo tempo...|`|605a481df6372a6db2f890432b607c6daa	Você está errado garoto, o xavequeiro é um romantico, o cafajeste é aquele que xavéca todas e n?o fica com nenhuma.|`|OAzzT9iNaa	A mulher gosta de ser conquistada,mimada e n?o de se sentir uma qualquer!A mulher é um ser sensível e é regida mais pelos sentimentos do que qualquer outra coisa.Já o homem faz mais uso da lógica e é mais objectivo.Por isso é que até num relacionamento em que só existe sexo é mais fácil a mulher se apaixonar do que o homem porque ele tem os seus objectivos tra?ados e a mulher nem tanto.è claro que nenhuma mulher gosta de saber que está a ser conquistada só para acabar na cama o mais rápido possível ou que é apenas mais uma da listinha dele...Até porque quando um homem tá mesmo interessado ele faz de tudo...|`|gZflxxRRaa	Paulo, vc está errado.<br>  Cafajeste é o cara que sai com todas, n?o importa onde, quem como, quando. Este tipo de cara n?o conquista as mulheres, e sim as encanta, as seduz. Se ele quer ir pra cama com uma mulher, fará de tudo até conseguir, mas logo depois que conquista seu "troféu", desiste e parte para outra. O objetivo dele é sempre conquistar uma mulher nova ou o maior número de mulheres. Ele está sempre se desafiando a um novo target.<br>  Já um "homem que é homem", como vc colocou, é o cara que realmente tem interesse na mulher e a conquista para ser sempre dele. Um homem que sabe o que quer n?o precisa estar toda hora xavecando, toda hora buzinando na orelha dela: ele o faz naturalmente. é a arte do relacionamento. Tanto ele como ela devem fazer coisas para manter o relacionamento. Isso envolve um agrado de vez em quando, ceder em algumas coisas e até fazer o que realmente gosta com a pessoa amada.|`|ytupP5nkaa	Homem que é homem como você mensionou ele xaveca ou melhor conquista uma mulher só!<br>  O cafageste xaveca várias e pega algumas!!!<br>  A diferen?a basicamente é está!

A resposta é simples meu amigo: nós mulheres desejamos atitudes.<br>  Em nosso vocabulário, a??es valem mais do que palavras. N?o adianta o rapaz se matar de dizer:- "Eu te amo", se seus gestos nos dizem o oposto disto.<br>  <br>  Vou colocar aqui, algumas das atitudes que mais apreciamos, e que faz com que nosso cora??o acelere a mil por hora, e que nosso corpo fique louquinho de vontade de proporcionar à você, todos os prazeres que desejar...<br>  Garoto esperto, ficou interessado agora n?o é?<br>  N?o estou falando de atitudes tais como lambidas, etc. As atitudes que contam para nós s?o aquelas que acontecem fora da cama, mas as que com certeza te levar?o para a cama, tais como:<br>  <br>  saiba ouvir - se depois de um dia inteiro de trabalho, você chega em casa e a única companhia que oferece a sua mulher é perguntar o que tem para o jantar e depois come?ar a mexer no controle remoto da tv, alheio a tudo...meu amigo, tenho certeza que o corpo dela n?o estará a mil por hora neste exato momento. <br>  Se chegasse uma visita você largaria tudo, atenderia a porta e por certo, conversaria horas. Porque n?o dedicar aten??o a sua mulher, por 15 minutos. Pergunte como foi o dia, se ela precisa de ajuda, enfim estabele?a contato. Lembre-se: se o E.T. conseguiu, você também consegue.<br>  <br>  elogie - saiba que nosso ponto G verdadeiramente fica nos ouvidos. N?o espere o momento certo para elogiar sinceramente, n?o espere que ela lhe pergunte e por favor esque?a aquela frase- "Eu n?o preciso dizer, pois você já sabe". Saiba que 1 minuto de elogio, rende horas de amor com uma mulher apaixonada.<br>  <br>  beijo cinematográfico - beijo é term?metro de relacionamento. Se seu beijo está resumido a bitoca, o seu relacionamento logo, logo também estará. Ent?o amigo, beije muuuuuuuito.<br>  <br>  lave a lou?a - isto mesmo. Precisamos sentir que n?o somos parte da mobília da casa. E quando você tem qualquer atitude demonstrando que deseja ajudar, isto faz um bem danado a rela??o. Mas por favor, n?o fa?a só quando desejar sexo, pois ent?o n?o será ajuda sincera, e sim um negócio.<br>  <br>  romantismo - seja romantico. Pratique. E o motivo é simples: melhora muito a qualidade de vida amorosa. Seja carinhoso, romantico, e logo verá os resultados.<br>  <br>  diálogo - comunique-se com sua amada. Abra seu cora??o e seja um bom ouvinte. Nunca converse lendo o jornal ou assistindo tv.<br>  <br>  abra?os e beijos curativos - quando perceber que ela está com dificuldade em alguma coisa, em primeiro lugar abrace, beije, diga que tudo dará certo e depois dê sua opini?o. Nestas horas de dificuldades, o que mais desejamos s?o seus ombros e n?o um serm?o de sua boca.<br>  <br>  tempo - arranje tempo com qualidade para estarem juntos, de preferência sozinhos.<br>  <br>  auto-estima - fa?a com que ela se sinta a mulher mais amada e desejada do planeta. N?o há homem melhor no mundo, do que aquele que faz com que a mulher se sinta bem consigo mesma.<br>  <br>  n?o seja previsível - surpreenda, invente coisas, situa??es, passeios, enfim, fuja da rotina, ela vai amar.<br>  <br>  bom humor - lembre-se que a melhor coisa do mundo é estar ao lado de um homem bem humorado.<br>  <br>  incentivo - nunca ria das atitudes dela.

qbg2eSSBaa	Contrary to popular belief, there is no definite way to determine if someone is "the one". You can not just tell from the moment you meet. As a matter of fact, half of the time, you may not even look at the person in a sexual perspective when you first meet them. Many successful relationships started initially with the couple being merely friends. The best advice for you would be to not look for love. Otherwise, you won't find it. Let love find you. Love has to be unexpected, not searched for. Only then will it be real.|`|1kzdnVi8aa	ya don't know until you know, and then, you just know. there is no how or why or when or anything. there just is or isnt :)|`|34bdjYunaa	ya dont thats the fun of it =) ya have ups and downs but ya get through if ya look for the one ya never find him but if ya relax and take love as it cums  it will be funner and youl find him once its time x
IwEpMFCaaa	Take it slow. You have issues of trust to work on that will affect this potential relationship if you don't deal with them. <br>  <br>  The reality is that all men are not cheaters and most can be trusted. You just have to take things really slowly, get to know this guy really well before you jump into anything serious, ask lots of questions along the way and allow your heart to follow. <br>  <br>  Remember always that trust must be earned and not given away freely. Choose to make wise decisions with regards to relationships and you will be okay.<br>  <br>  Just for today in answer to your question: Take it slow. Good Luck.|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	Just  leave  it  up  to  him.  Don't  make  any  kind  of  a  move  on  him.  He  sees  you,  knows  you  are  there  and  he'll  make  his  move  when  he  is  ready.  His  silence  is  saying,  he's  not  yet  ready.  So  don't  think  you  have  to  "do  something"  or  he'll  slip  thru  your  fingers.  You  can't  make  anyone  notice  you.  Just  make  sure  that  you  are  well  groomed,  attractive  and  easy  to  be  with.  If  you  happen  to  bump  into  him,  smile  and  say  Hi,  and  keep  moving.  You'll  be  more  appealing  that  way.|`|z4KGoQAlaa	kick him to the curb|`|EPrONX0Baa	take it slow, don't show you want him so much thats how you get cheated on.|`|c7dc8d3d29ca81cb8abad5dc040e4b75aa	Make a move and let things happen.

Amor que dói n?o é amor, é obsess?o, é idéia fixa, é baixa auto-estima ou é tudo isso junto. Amor de verdade n?o dói. Amor de verdade é sentimento ameno e prazeroso, que n?o dói nem mesmo quando estamos longe da pessoa amada. Boa sorte.|`|0034c93122ebe108d6e71135ddd9ff3daa	Eu!!!    Mas aproveito este momento para declarar que amo muito a minha esposa, e n?o sei ficar sem ela de jeito nenhum. E ela nunca me deixa passar falta tanto que sou casado há 15 anos e nunca tive outra fora e nem quero. Olha que sou filho de homem que tinha nove mulheres todas assumidas e vivíamos com muita fartura, mas nenhum de meus irm?os seguiram os passos de nosso pai. Amante agente tem em casa e fa?o da minha mulher o que eu faria com uma amante lá fora. O amor vem de Deus, porque de amor Ele entende muito bem. O amor é uma coisa muito gostosa e muito linda, o amor n?o nos provocar ciúmes, antes pelo contrário, ele nos faz confiar em quem amamos. Fazer amor com quem amamos, é a maior delícia, até as palavras que saem neste momento e até o olhar é extremamente gostoso, é diferente de sexo, o amor dá vontade de estar sempre fazendo carinho no outro. Hoje mesmo pude fazer amor com a minha esposa, falamos de coisas boas que acende cada vez mais a nossa rela??o e repartimos muitos beijos e abra?os, o cheiro da pessoa que amamos fica impregnado em nosso nariz, isto é inexplicável nem a ciência n?o compreende, n?o temos receio de entregar o nosso cora??o, e de tanto gozo e prazer que nesta hora sempre sai o famoso "eu te amo" e as fantasias s?o simplesmente complemento daquilo que queremos apimentar o nosso amor. Assim tudo é real, n?o existe mentira e nem demagogia para convencer o outro. Eu n?o economizo elogios a ela. O amor nos faz preocupar com a outra pessoa, queremos sempre saber se ela está bem. E tudo que posso fazer para vê-la feliz, isto fa?o. Amo a minha esposa, estamos juntos há 15 anos e meu amor é maior hoje do que quando come?amos a namorar. Brigas - Quase n?o existe no meio daqueles que amam, isto n?o faz parte de nossas vidas, existem certos pontos que n?o concordamos, mas brigas, foi só no início, no período de adapta??o, porém com o tempo isto acabou, gra?as a Deus. Assim é o amor, e assim que vivo com a pessoa que amo muito. Ela é ótima e apaixonante e tudo que fa?o com ela é com muito amor, e durante este tempo todo, eu nunca ouvi falar que existisse pessoa como ela, e nunca a vi nervosa e está sempre alegre e constantemente com o sorriso no rosto, tudo para ela está muito bom. é uma ótima educadora e conselheira de nossos filhos e minha, pois só me dá bons conselhos e opina quando acho que certas atitudes minha deveria ser diferente, é responsável pela supervis?o da igreja que frequentamos, todos lá a amam, e lá ela dá conselhos a todos. é uma excelente companheira, n?o me deixa sem "amor", está sempre preocupada se estou em falta ou n?o. Me ajuda nas despesas da casa, pois ela trabalha de técnico em enfermagem, é uma excelente profissional. Eu estou descrevendo aqui o perfil dela, e imagino que muitos n?o acreditar?o, mas o que importa que ela é para mim e para minha família. Meu amor. N?o economizo nenhum elogio a ela, ela está sempre disposta a ajudar a quem precisa e além do mais uma pessoa centrada. Tanto para mim, quanto na educa??o de nossos filhos, basta você conversar com meus filhos vai perceber que tem que ser alguém muito bem instruído para educar as crian?as conforme eles s?o educados. Eu louvo a Deus pela esposa que tenho que nunca me nega carinho e ainda gosta de fazer amor comigo a qualquer hora. Elisangela, Meu bem, eu te amo!!!!! TE AMO MUUUUUIIIIIIIITTTTTTOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Essa situa??o n?o é fácil. Ele deve estar estressado, com a procura por um novo emprego. Esse stress pode ser um motivo de ele n?o estar te satisfazendo como deveria.<br>  <br>  Os irm?os dele sempre namoram em casa. Mas, o fato deles fazerem n?o quer dizer que ele também o deva fazer. Ele deve achar isso uma falta de respeito e, para dar o exemplo, n?o faz. Quer um espa?o que seja dele, ou que ele possa usar sem restri??es. Já pensou nisso?<br>  <br>  Vocês s?o adultos e possuem uma vida sexual ativa. Sugiro a você fazer o seguinte: chame-o para um diálogo franco. Diga que está sentindo falta de fazer amor com ele. Pe?a a ele que a leve para a sua casa, mas, sem exageros. Vocês podem ficar lá um pouco, e depois saírem.<br>  <br>  Beijos e espero ter ajudado.|`|9SM3Dmljaa	Eu acho q sexo n?o é tudo, mas é quase tudo... sexo é o que diferencia namorados, ficantes, casados dos amigos e familiares... sendo ent?o 95 por cento do relacionamento.. conversa com ele e veja se é esse mesmo o motivo, mas talvez ele esteja sem-gra?a de levar vc la na ksa dele por ele n?o ta trabalhando... procurem outro lugar pra fazer amor, nem que ele ou vc pague um motel por 10 reais 2 horas. sério.|`|O0ypM93Caa	Nossa, que situa??o! Isso deve ser muito chato, o estranho é ele apesar de tudo que descreveu sobre os irm?os n?o querer ter intimidade com vc lá... Ele tem que ter um motivo muito bom pra isso, talvez ele tenha mas n?o está te falando, ele deveria ser também muito interessado em fazer alguma coisa. Será que ele n?o era contra essa liberdade dos irm?os dele e pra n?o dar o bra?o a torcer n?o ker fazer o mesmo?<br>   Por qual motivo ele se sentiria com menos direitos de liberdade na casa dele do que os irm?os? <br>  Será que ele n?o quer largar de vc mas n?o tem coragem de dizer e ent?o ta nessa press?o pra ver se vc desiste?<br>  Pode ser muita coisa , mas só ele pode te dizer, vc tem raz?o de querer intimidade, isso é normal pra todo casal que uma vez tenha iniciado a vida sexual...<br>  <br>  Boa sorte!|`|a7QjL56qaa	OI!

36ad1432f98c4bf465e567e41e544585aa	Uau David, jantar a luz de velas. Que romantico!!! Adoro isso. Ent?o neste caso, o cardápio ideal é aquele com receitas que vocês podem preparar juntinhos (ou vc preparar só), sem precisar de ficar descascando cebola ou picando alho. Picar qualquer ingrediente é muito chato! Ent?o, deixe o pré-preparo já organizado (pelo menos 4 ou 5 horas antes de come?ar preparar o jantar), com os ingredientes separados, lavados, cortados. Lembre-se m?o cheirando a alho, antes, durante ou depois do jantar corta qualquer clima...<br>  <br>  A sugest?o para este menu inclui trouxinhas de Legumes para a entrada e um Espaguete Romantico, como prato principal, para ser feito e saboreado a dois e quem sabe repetir aquela tradicional cena de "A Dama e o Vagabundo"? Olha que tudo!!!!<br>  Para a sobremesa, há duas sugest?es: Profiteroles com Calda de Chocolate, aquelas bombinhas deliciosas recheadas de soverte de creme... Ou um Morango Surpresa, recheado de cream cheese(creme de queijo) e amêndoas. A surpresa fica por conta da imagina??o de VCS!<br>  <br>  Boa Sorte e ótimo jantar!|`|BIinZ1Uzaa	lasanha! meu namorado ama, eu ja fiz varias pra ele!|`|iIfb1HdUaa	N?o sei se serve como jantar mas um fondue com um bom vinho é t?o romantico!!!|`|LfrQq2mgaa	Faria uma moqueca de camar?o super caprichado, com decora??o do prato  de grandes camar?es.

Ele veio comeu, gostou, tudo certo.<br>  Mas depois q a gente foi tendo mais intimidade...  ele confessou q detesta massa!

Xgdkjhbtaa	She does sound a little bit disturbed. I guess my question for you would be, why do you feel a need to tell her off?

And i'd learn more about surfing and ask her a really hard question about it, and hope she got it wrong so you could tell her off THEN you can say she sucks at surfing.

It sounds like you have a crush on her but she does not on you, what you listed above is a list of a friend being a good friend and thats all she is going to ever be, get a hold of yourself not every girl who does this means that they like you...you need to ask her if you are still unsure.|`|00zwjotjaa	well it sounds to me that she liked u, honey! but now she has a bf and is most likly not intrested! i am srry but if she wants u she will dump this guy and go for u! u seem very nice, and thats all a girl looks for in a man! so u will probubly get a gurl in the next week!<br>  goodluck love,<br>  casey :)|`|w5K8WlORaa	Hmm to me it sounds like she's a bit interested, but doesn't think you are interested in her.

TOhdRTEeaa	En mi vida habia entrado a un chat, me sentia sola pues habia tenido una fuerte decepcion de un chavo, una amiga me conto de un chat, entre y justo cuando iba a salirme como era un chat 3d de mu?equitos choque con uno y no podia salirme<br>  total comenzamos la platica pero el es de otro pais, no tan lejano al mio peroo bueno.<br>  <br>  Total  desde q empezamos a platicar senti una necesidad de hablar con el todos los dias, como si el me diera vida....y al parecer comenzamos a ser novios de mentiras pues para ambos era un juego.<br>  <br>  Cuando ambos nos dimos cuenta el juego se nos salio de las manos, ya no era un simple juego y empezabamos a sentir algo.<br>  <br>  Llevaamos aproximadamente 6 meses una relacion excelente donde ambos dimos todo y por cosas de la vida terminamos, y lo peor es que no fue por la distancia ni por falta de amor sino que fue la mejor decision pues ambos queriaos a futuros cosas distintas y no lograbamos juntarnos....aun asi lo sigo queriendo como a nadie en el mundo, y se que si Dios quiere estaremos juntos, y lo que yo pienso es que yo pongo todo lo humano de mi parte y dios pondra lo divino.<br>  <br>  Creo que ha sdo la relacion si no la mas bonita la mas honesta pues jamas me abri con nadie de la manera en que abri mis sentimientos a el-.<br>  <br>  Y pues ahora a esperar a que el tiempo diga, yo decidi terminar mi carrera en mi pais, pero tengo pensado en Julio ir a su pais a pesar de lo que la gente piense creo que lo mas grande que se puede aprender es a amar y a ser amado y a demostrarle a todos q el amor se encuentra de la manera mas rara y menos esperada.|`|nFAVVHPwaa	La conocí en el chat de lycos, aqui en yahoo... Al principio ni le paraba bola, yo pendejeaba con otro chica del chat y además su corta edad al lado de la mía me frenaba fijarme en ella... pero la chica nunca se hechó para atras, luchó y esa lucha y empe?o me hizo doblegarme ante la evidencia. En aquellos tiempo me demostró mucho más que la propia chica con la que yo andaba y felizmente decidí acabar con aquello, ser realista y comenzar con esta otra que ya si empezó a llamar mi atención. Ahora ya estamos juntos, y eso que era de otro país, pero me alegro que ella fuera así, porque gracias a su lucha nosotros estamos ahora juntos en pareja y nos va de lo más bien. A veces la evidencia es la mejor consejera. Saludos|`|8C6xPxAsaa	snifffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff...<br>  <br>  quieres que llore o que!!!!!<br>  <br>  se supone que mi ciber novio iba a venir a verme y no se nada de el desde hace mas deuna semana..... no se que pasa,... lo adoro y el dice que me ama... me pidio que me casara con el pero yo necesito verlo en persona para saber si en vdd lo quiero o solo fue ilusion no se.... se ha portado raro distante y no se que paso .... ahora me esta yendo muy mal en esto y no se que hacer. ya lo busque pero se porto bien raro cortante y como enfadado.... no soy empalagosa ni nada... soy buena onda soy joven linda. pero no se que paso, creo que el amor no esta hecho para mi :(
s4trJc34aa	Pelo q vc disse parece que ela está insegura... Ela deve estar com medo dos próprios sentimentos. Vá lá e converse com ela. Tenho percebido em suas perguntas que essa garota te faz muita falta mesmo passando tanto tempo que est?o separados. Ela n?o poderá te enrolar pra sempre n?o eh? Vá até lá e diga tudo o que está acontecendo. Mais n?o se contente com "meias palavras" igual ela fez(digo no caso de falar pra vc n?o ir e n?o te dar um motivo pra isso). Seja sincero e pessa pra que ela também seja mais sendo clara e objetiva.  <br>  Boa sorte!!!<br>  Bjos|`|aCJorLaUaa	O nervosismo dela era preocupa??o do outro ver voces juntos conversando.p? meu camarada segue teu rumo e vai a luta.|`|UbPoTDqEaa	Se ela n?o quer te magoar porque gosta de v? é lo′gico que n?o diria n?o na tua frente mas por telefone é mais facil descartar.

Sors avec tes amis, vois du monde, fais toi jolie, et regarde ton pouvoir de seduction que tu as envers les hommes en soirées, tu verras quand on y fait attention c'est flagrant. Va faire du shopping, offre toi de nouvelles sapes bien belles histoire de te sentir mignonne, bien ta peau tu verras ?a fait du bien. Va aussi faire du sport, ton corps te remerciera de cette grosse bouffée d'oxygène que tu lui offres. Aères toi l'esprit, prend du recul par rapport à tout ce qui t'est anciennement arrivé de mal et positive, prévois et plannifie des choses futures que tu aurais envie qui se réalisent.

8PNKUTWFaa	oh lolz don't be such a pushover...well i had this friend that thought he was so funny. He is sort of a player so he was seeing many chicks at one time and felt like he could easily replace them. So he wanted to see if he could get his gf real pissed by just ignoring her and hanging up the phone on her for no reason. Well she blamed herself and thought that he REALLY was pissed of at her, when in reality, he was laughing his *** off. IDK if your bf is like my friend then you should maybe not respond to his calls for a while then he might take you seriously.

Well I think that she makes herself mad at you, because she knows that it is wrong how she is being unfaithful to her boyfriend.

She might just be really hormonal.. in that case its not your fault. Maybe she gets her anger from liking you and her boyfriend at the same time..  Whenever she gets mad, give her some space and let get her time alone. You are probably not doing anything wrong, shes most likely just confused about something.  When you and her are together just remember to be yourself and try not to get really annoying.|`|jNB2CSekaa	She isn"t getting what she needs from you.She may have a boyfriend but that is not where her heart is..She is unsure of how you feel ,and it makes her feel unsure of being around you.I am not saying that it is all your fault by no means ,just that the two of you need to talk openly and honestly.Best to you.

If you think he likes you, that he finds you attractive then I think it's OK for you to tell him. If you're not sure, be careful because you might be risking a beautiful friendship for a crush that you're not sure how it is going to end up. If you still can live with him being your friend, try to keep it like that until you're absolutely sure he's done with his ex.<br>  Good luck.
2DdKdztGaa	I think it depends... try having him raise his butt up while you're on top (or put a nice big pillow under it) and then have hm psh up as you're pushing down... I've found that woman on top is better if you try to take it slow and then you get to build up into an even better *ahem* as you say... but I guess it depends... before I discovered the pillow trick, I would have totally agreed with you, but then you can also get some amazing penetration if you get on top of your man... :)|`|D75HBm5Vaa	I love being on top!!!...although, rarely, in the pass I have had problems getting a good rhythm going...but, with practice makes perfect! :)|`|kPyVTLRKaa	hahaha. thats how i am too... this made me laugh <br>  because sometimes i feel like it feels WAY better when hes on top.. just depending on the day.. i like having a grip on his arms ... and hes in good shape too so i can see his body:Di get really nervous for some reason while i am on top sometimes.... but.. i love my boy.. so .. yeah.. <br>  in all well.. he makes me happy no matter what:)<br>  <br>  haha.. good luck!|`|iA4c0kr9aa	Missionary is alright sometimes, but it's hard to orgasm this way for me unless it's the "legs across shoulders" thing to where every thrust is just right there!  I like being on top as it gives you more of a sense of control and also you can control the penetration from there as well.  Myself, I'd say my favorite though is doggystyle.  You get all the penetration adn can control by thrusting back into him also.  You just need to experiment a bit and see what works the best for you guys!  Nothing wrong in practicing!

Scratch that, is she hot? Are you sure she's not playing a game to see if you will screw around on her daughter? See if she'll get naked and walk away without touching her. Take pics and sell them on the internet, you might make enough money to pay the divorce lawyer! <br>  <br>  Really, how mad can your wife possibly get? After all, you are at least keeping it in the family.
GQUaFGHLaa	If the music is too high then don't get in the car with your friend if he wants the two of you to do things together. Let him know that you do not appreciate the loud music. I have seen different people who have their music on very loud and we can sometimes hear it when they pull up beside us in their car. Your friend sounds like he is afraid that everyone won't hear the music. I do not like loud music especially in the car.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	It is inconsiderate, but it is his car.  If you can't stand it ride with someone else.|`|ctTlpQXmaa	well i think you could just ask him to turn it down a lil bit. it all depends on the car like if it is a piece of crap and he plays loud music or if it is nice he plays loud music either way people will notice and some people dont like the loud music so just tell him to turn it down of find something u both like!|`|fNVwalW9aa	maybe just say could you lower it, its really starting to hurt my ears. if hes your friend then he should turn it off and if he only wants to have the big bass tell him to switch to rap. much more bass.<br>  <br>  but as for the ride, it is his car so beggers cant be choosers.<br>  sucks i know
PNCRBg1Naa	I know from experience that guys sometimes go out with a girl just to have a gf not because they love her,like her,or even respect her.|`|3861687722a84d2bbb3295afb54293e7aa	Could you repost this in English?|`|ceNvYOU6aa	That isnt clear|`|248dd4fe9683917c2c6b451a878a7573aa	he must really like you and cant stop thinking about you!!!!|`|S8nyP9cpaa	Well let's be honest here.  No one spoke to you, so why are you speaking?  Women are to be seen, and not to be heard.  So yes, us "guys" realize that woman are meant to be subservient and to do three things for us.  Cook for us, please us, and raise our children.  So my advice to you is learn some punctuation, tug on his love lance, and speak when spoken to.
YlvkSWh3aa	he is just comfortable where he is in the relationship. he might think that saying i love you would put his neck on the line for getting hurt. just give him patients and in time he will tell you.|`|8f59356433fca8577deb8610de6e9940aa	It sounds like he's telling you that he loves you in a different way. Two years is a long time to NOT love somebody. I don't know about how to make him tell you...but it sounds like he does. It just takes people longer sometimes to say that. It's a bigger deal for some people. I would pay attention to his actions and not so much his words. It sounds like he's trying to show it.|`|M3UMDQCOaa	hell, id rather have a guy that showed it, than said it.... he seems to love you, but maybe you should talk to him... maybe he is not ready to say those 3 little words, that so many people toss around so easily....<br>  <br>  just talk to him, if hes not ready yet, im sure he will be.... he sounds like the perfect boyfriend :-)|`|4prOKJHWaa	ask him how he feels about you..maybe he'll start to tell you it slowly..becasue he sure does show it..|`|XrZi9Aelaa	oh my god so leave him and onther one
eVunFMjIaa	compliment|`|REfeGqgjaa	if he trully does love you he would have said NO i would never cheat on my girlfriend/wife.|`|Tmrhd3hmaa	my bf said the same thing to me about me.  He said if he wanted to cheat on me he would be things would be over in a heart beat.  so really he wouldn't cheat on me if he ended it with me first.  if he says he thinks you are the best thing that has ever happened to him and there is no one else better take what he said before that with a grain of salt.  He probably wanted to seem some what tough in front of his friends but at the same time let them know that he is happy with you.  Relax, everything is fine.|`|qPKCK2KOaa	It is what it is.  He's made it clear that he'll leave you as soon as he finds something better.|`|2b44d3b76e52e466167cbcfb6cff9eb5aa	Ouch! Something better comes along? How could being thought of as possible second rate be a compliment? Is he saying that he's keeps an eye out for a better girlfriend? The question should be, could there be someone better than him? A real man who knows what he real wants and doesn't question it. A man who can realise what he truely has. I don't see how anyone couldn't see this as a hurtfull remark. I noticed someone commended his honesty. I disagree. If he is interested in killing time in a relationship before jumping into the next "better" one, he sould have been truthful about it. On the flip side, there is a chance that he was talking big in front of his male buddies, which is still inappropriate! If it's more important to impress his freinds while hurting you, there is still a problem. I hope you 2 are able to work it out. Good luck|`|77e04d35104a6645c91205879cdd6f75aa	Aww i think thats really sweet of him!! *Giggle's*<br>  Defently a compliment... :-)|`|d3e8587c275ea30ce075b969f5d4e37daa	itsa compliment!!! 100%|`|rwHvsbEAaa	hey..y u felt a bit hurt?it a compliment!!|`|983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	It may seem somewhat unromantic, but the fact is that there is always someone out there in the world that is more perfect for either you or your man, however, the chances of ever meeting that person are very, very remote. I would not say what he said was an insult but I can certainly see how you might also not take it as a compliment. <br>  <br>  He was being honest, though, which accounts for something. If you are honest with yourself, you might imagine that there is someone out there in the world that is more perfect for you than he is, for example, someone who doesn't say such things?|`|8dbe787d6f7eabd0a689b1f0a12a3ed3aa	Oh dear.....well those aren't really encouraging words, in fact they are a bit tactless. Maybe he was genuinely trying to make it out as a compliment?
YzcwIplfaa	If you want inconspicuous strike up a conversation with one of your girlfriends (in-front of the punk) about the things that interest you. Talk about your dating situation and how you are in the dating scene. Don't forget to make eye contact with him just as you say you are dating. If he doesn't ask you out then and he is still giving you all the signs he might be just to shy. Try asking him what he is doing the coming weekend. If he is going out tell him you might see him there.|`|1803PY0Jaa	If you are sure he is flirting and things then just be direct. Ask him out. If you are not comfortable with that then flirt back. often the subtle things: a touch on his arm in conversation, or a smile will go a long way to helping him get the idea.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  J_musicman|`|TK98U66kaa	If you feel that strongly about this person why not tell him, there is no right or wrong way to express the way you feel about someone. Just follow your heart, but do this  with a strong mind and I think you'll be fine. Furthermore, if he doesn't respond the way you hope him to, just remember that life is full of challenges and this is just one of many along the way.|`|eI4IxBaLaa	Quit playing games and be direct.  Just ask him to have coffee or something.  You can take the first step.  Time's slipping by, honey!|`|75NzrTs3aa	Jen is right you know....<br>  Listen to Jen|`|GY3C2MIeaa	give him something i call "the look". its direct eye to eye contact  that says "heeeey" or "i want you". throw some hints at him and dont be shy to flirt with him. be playfully seriously, so he takes the hints. work your way into it, and it'll work out nicely. hope this helps ^_^. good luck
crLwncfyaa	U have only ur imagination that have been built from what the other side told u.....no more, no less!|`|hBym8nY3aa	just dont meet up with them in person! because that could be dangerous. im saying this from experience sweetheart! even if you do decide to meet him make sure its in a public place and stay at that public place with him and bring a friend to stay with you also. never go alone or meet a guy from online alone because anything could happen he could rape you or kill you it could be a dangerous situation you should never put yourself in. so as long as you keep the relationship online then thats fine nothing wrong with that. and as far as you falling for them..sweetheart realize it is the internet that fool could be telling you anything! we can be anybody we want to be i could tell you im blond hair with blue eyes and im 5foot tall and im a model or i could tell you im a 20year old handsome man and my paerent are rich..lol..they are all just words..dont believe anything hes saying..like i said keep it as that..ONLINE RELATIONSHIP..online..online!!!! good luck!|`|xbPoMcMCaa	Heck yeah in fact thats how I met Sharon.<br>  In the old days "pen pals" would correspond by mail never seeing each other fall in love and agree to marry only seeing each other for the first time when she arrived to him wherever in the world he was.<br>  So my advise talk for 3 to 6 months get to know each other well and of course be cautious.<br>  Good luck<br>  Joe|`|juRWvc0eaa	Like meeting someone ANYWHERE, one should use caution and common sense. There are some Dangerous people out there, but no more so than anywhere else.<br>  No matter if it is in person or on line, one needs to take things slow and be sure of things BEFORE taking the big step of getting involved.<br>  Has it ever happened? - Sure. I have dated a couple of people I have met in the past on line. Some were good experiences, others were not. Just be careful and use common sense and you should be fine...

I mainly don't speak to to her conversation wise, but I do speak to her(little talking here and there) but I would do anything for her..just say the word|`|81686470b8ca19d65b905d1a87037c2caa	ask for it & call him up.<br>  then tell him you got the number because you wanted to help him in school (tutor)<br>  or because you wanna make him break out of his shell<br>  or because you want to know more about something he's interested in..<br>  he'll most likely be nice to you. im guessing,<br>  good luckkkkk(=|`|HnWgVzDEaa	No... If he cannot see your beauty you should not worry about it ...  One day he will.. and it might be too late ... Do not let other people stop you from being happy ... be happy w/ what you have in your life....|`|Kql7dn7Waa	No, you should ask the guy for it. Be straight forward with him and tell him how you feel. If you ask for it from someone else he may ask you why you didn't ask him and then that would be hard to answer especially to the guy you like.
nJW9miEKaa	hmmm....maybe you should confront your friend first and ask her why she said she wouldnt copy you and than go and copy you....does that make sense???<br>  <br>  hmmm well maybe you should style your hair differently ....<br>  without cutting it or anything.|`|PBX0h0zyaa	well who cares about your friend.I think you have a great look from what you said. She probally saw how good it looked on you then wanted to try it..|`|oJqbyj7Qaa	natural hair color is the most beautiful. and yes your friend was wrong|`|7C2EgKUmaa	You should be flattered that she copied you because that means she really admires you !!<br>  anyways tell that ur not very happy with her coz she did that, and maybe add a personal touch to ur hair, like new hairclip or something Xx|`|AA12136732	Your friend obviously likes your hair !  dont change because she did. Keep it the way you like to wear it. I wouldnt worry. Perhaps she wants to be like you, and thats a compliment !|`|GJ9erWf4aa	Dont worry about your friend and what she did because your hair must look good or she would not have coppyed.just style your hair the way you want it and hold your head up adn wear it well i know you can, i know you will You GoGirl|`|GSxUQbDMaa	You should tell your friend to change her hair! YOU got the idea first and she just copied it! But, if she doesn't do it then well you'll have to come up with something else. I thought maybe, black/dark brown/brown hair with lilac streaks... that's pretty cool. Or you could dye it black & Dark blue or something....<br>  Anywayss, good luck!|`|WWndcDQUaa	just leave your heir the same ..i think ..|`|i0DddiYdaa	keep ur hair the same but change the hairstyle..thats what i think..good luck

b3d54fcb92b1f2e79118daa7b4badbceaa	I think it's very possible to find that kind of love at a young age.  It can be difficult when you find love so early because you still have so much growing and character building to go....  But I was very much in love at 14.  He was my best friend, my protector, my safety.   The love I had for him is different than the love I feel for my husband, because it was young love...  But it was love.   No one can say if another person does or does not love someone.    Don't worry about what everyone else thinks and enjoy yourself.  You have something meaningful and other people will be jealous or try to make you feel like a little kid.  Don't sweat what other people think.  You know your heart and you know your boyfriend.  Just be young and have fun.   Don't give those other people a second thought!|`|1cd670be21f4f441ca7a300a77b2940eaa	People say the same thing to me.

Nao tenha medo do que seus amigos possam pensar de suas atitudes. Homens geralmente sao machistas quando estao em bandos, mas qdo estao com suas namoradas, costumam ser (ou tentam) bem carinhosos.

Agrade?a a ela por ter vindo, se aproxime rápido e de um rapido estalinho bem na boca dela !!!! e diga PRONTA??? VAMOS !!!!<br>  <br>  Pegue ela pelas m?os e vá a formatura... Ela ficará pensando no que aconteceu nesse meio tempo e acabará por perguntar porque vc a beijou......<br>  <br>  Diga que ela é maravilhosa, e a beijou porque está perdidamente apaixonado por ela... mas que vc como n?o sabe se ela vai te corresponder, ent?o vc apenas deixou pra lá..... E n?o quer a incomodar com seus desejos impuros....<br>  <br>  Ela ficará Louquinha !!!! Ent?o vc ainda manda essa... Porque perguntou ????<br>  <br>  Quero o meu 10 aqui pela resposta viu !!!

Sempre gostou de orientais e eu nunca namorei um oriental.. apenas ocidentais...<br>  N?o tem nada a ver com dinheiro, serem mais isto ou aquilo. Tem a ver com gosto pessoal. Assim como há loiros que gostam de negras e vice-versa. O que tem de mais nisso? <br>  Meus filhos s?o lindos e nos damos muito bem. Acho meu marido lindo e adoro os olhos claros dele. Ele acha maravilhoso o fato de eu ser pequena e ter meus olhos puxados... Mas conhe?o gente que n?o suporta orientais. Já fui discriminada em muitos lugares, seja por homem ou mulheres, só porque tenho os olhos puxados, embora seja brasileira... 3a gera??o de japoneses que vieram para cá...<br>  N?o tem nada a ver o que vc disse. Vc está generalizando um fato que deve estar ligado à você. N?o fique pensando besteiras. Tem muita brasileira maravilhosa que dá de 10 em uma oriental... mas quem vai dizer isto n?o é vc, mas o cara que escolher a mulher de sua vida.<br>  Detalhe: Eu me divorciei do meu marido, ficamos 3 anos separados... depois voltamos... re-casamos... estamos juntos há 4 anos agora, perfazendo um total de 15 anos...<br>  Nos conhecemos na faculdade e continuo achando ele lindo como antes... e ele... apesar do meu corpinho de antes n?o ser o mesmo... continua gostando de mim, ufa, ainda bem...hahahah<br>  No período que ficamos separados, eu me relacionei com outras pessoas, todas ocidentais... n?o deu certo. Ele, por sua vez, saiu com outras orientais... n?o tem jeito... era destino...hahahahah<br>  Desencana... e o que tiver que ser seu, será. Caso contrário, n?o adianta lutar contra o destino. N?o adianta recorrer aos famosos "trabalhos" de agarra homem, separa??o de homem com mulher etc... vc nunca saberá se ele está com vc por amor ou por que fez algo... (to brincando... acho que vc n?o faria isto...), mas conhe?o gente que fez... e se deu mal.<br>  E tem outra... se o cara larga a mulher, fica com vc... será que ele n?o te largará no futuro? é difícil saber... por isso que digo: o que tem que ser, será...<br>  Boa sorte!!!|`|539270258a2b099d679d0208b6b2f0aeaa	E daí?

Entendido?
dy4iifUWaa	Olha, términos de relacionamento s?o sempre difíceis d+... a gente se apega e se torna dependente da pessoa, como vc disse, "ele é a única pessoa que eu tenho"... o problema é que nessas situa??es a gente acaba esquecendo de si mesmo... sabe? De apreciar nossa própria companhia, de sentir prazer em fazer coisas que gosta pra si mesma...<br>  Eu sei que é sofrido, e é mto dificil se desapegar da pessoa. Mas veja, por mais q vc ame ele... nao tem como manter uma rela??o quando a outra pessoa nao quer, quando ele acha que é melhor terminar, e ele tem os motivos dele... n?o tem como,  a gente tem q respeitar e se conformar. Mas isso nao significa necessariamente q ele nao goste mais de vc, ele só acha melhor terminar o relacionamento de compromisso entre vcs...<br>  Nessas horas procure sentir q vc mesma está livre tbm... e agora vc pode come?ar uma nova etapa da sua vida. Diga a ele tudo oq vc sente, pra nao ficar nada guardado pra vc, resolvam tudo entre vcs, e vá em frente...<br>  Desejo que seja mto feliz!|`|emr921cTaa	prefere ser corna ou ser feliz sozinha e encontrar outra pessoa?|`|r6iTDoyCaa	homem como ele talvez nao tenha... mais melhor  tem sim..<br>  felicidades|`|539270258a2b099d679d0208b6b2f0aeaa	Mas pq ele sai escondido??

nYVNMedVaa	she sounds so much like my little darling girl!  if she likes to shake her bootie then you may consider one of those cheesy cd's at walmart that they have in the kids department that you can push buttons and play.  we have to go see it every time we go to walmart.  she likes the ABC one.  she might enjoy playdoh, really anything that requires her to use her hands.  you may also take her to walmart to get her picture taken for turning 2.  that's only like 5 bucks but it would be cute!  if you have any kids then maybe you could do a cousin shot.  books are always a good idea for 2 year olds.  we're starting to have to read 2-3 books a night...

rS8tFbtJaa	I had written this in response to your other question that you just deleted.  So here you go.<br>  <br>  Well, guys will only call a girl when they get it in thier heads to go do something with the girl.  In general guys don't call just to chat, it's not really our thing, if a conversation happens to start then it happens.  Also, often we will ask for phone numbers but never get the courage to call them, so he may never call.  And knowing the way guys are, he just might lose it somewhere between the time he took it from you and getting home that day.<br>  <br>  So basically, this guy will will probably go away for a week and when he comes back he might get the idea to call you up to go hang out with you.  I don't think i'd look for it happening before he gets back from his trip.  Best thing for you to do is contact him and give him your home phone number instead of your cell phone number.<br>  <br>  BTW i answered the question that you just deleted and in it you first said your college classes just ended, and then you said you were in "highskool".  If you want this guy to take you seriously, don't lie like you did there, just be honest.|`|74f4187d34db51d014e0616fd9bb778caa	Most likely he'll call on monday. Guys give that "weekend grace period"|`|oaVhxc8caa	he'll probably call da next day or  2.|`|qbg2eSSBaa	He'll call if he's interested. That's all. There is no specific date or time limit that a guy must call a girl after receiving her number. He'll call if he feels you're worth his time.|`|xzGG7M8Vaa	Depends on a lot of things, I guess.  Do you want him to call you this weekend?  He might be afraid that you would see him as needy if he calls right away.  Maybe he will wait a week then, but you might see him as being a player for waiting so long.  So then he might never call you, because he doesn't know what you want, and then you'll both be unhappy.<br>  <br>  Why don't you just give him a call instead?  :)

blvZkEjUaa	Yes, its possible. Its hard to tell what he really wants though. Have your friends scope him out and dont give it up too easy.  <br>  <br>  Im a 21 year old guy and am with an 18 year old girl and someone can say that is just as big of a difference as 30 to 21 in a lot of respects.<br>  <br>  If you really like the guy give him a chance.<br>  Good luck =)|`|juRWvc0eaa	Think about it my dear... What do the two of you have in common? Yes, you might be mature for your age, but a 9 year difference is a lot to over come. <br>  IT is FAR more likely that he wants a sexual relationship with a hot young woman. To answer your question, While I would never say never, as a 30 year old, I would find it HIGHLY UNLIKELY that I would be interested in a 21 yer old for anything other than a purely physical relationship.|`|wlAPzz7Waa	I am in my 30's and my girlfriend is 20. We have been dating for 2+ years. I am not going to speak for all guys but, sure a lot of them are attracted to the younger looking girls, myself included. But, that doesn't mean they only are into them for one thing either. I think if you guys share common interests and have very similar views on the way of life then you should be a good match. Don't let the age # be the reason why you dont pursue something that could end up being the best decision you ever made. Just take things slow, get to know him and go from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck

I think if you want to know if he likes you without just asking him...you can observe how he behaves around you versus other female friends he may have. Does he treat you differently? Have you seen how he's acted with other women he may have been interested in in the past? Does he show those signs with you? I'm not saying, if none of those are true that he doesn't like you, but those seem to be good hints.|`|JHkDA3DSaa	Hey, your mate is supposed to be your best friend, so you've got a great head-start!

juRWvc0eaa	This is common for someone who was cheated on to hurt a nice guy/girl right afterward. I know that does not make it any easier my friend. She may actually feel bad now, but you are right to let her go and refuse to give her a 2nd chance.<br>  Learn from this and break the cycle. Remember the pain of this so that you never even give cheating a 2nd thought in your future relationships. Good luck in the future.

Continuar dando murro em ponta de faca, só pra n?o ficar sózinha? Antes só, do que mal acompanhada! Mesmo que vc n?o fique com o outro, liberte-se dos seus problemas.

UTzERFbyaa	"?Cual es LA MEJOR manera de demostrar (durante una relacion) el amor intenso que se siente?"......wao esta de verdad que que esta durita...para mi es asi...<br>  1.No hay UNA manera especifica para demostrarle amor a alguien...el amor abarca demasiadas cosas....y UNA sola no sirve sin ayuda de las demas...<br>  2.para que alguien conosca tu amor...no hace falta mucho porque el amor no es algo que se da a conocer sino que se brinda...<br>  3.A veces al buscar complacer en todo se pierde el significado de la relacion....que es ESTAR AHI CUENDO EL/ELLA LO NECESITE porque deseas lo mejor para el otro....no estar ahi para recivir ...claro que a quien no le gusta ser mimado XD....<br>  bueno....ta taiii =)|`|6xgigN5Haa	lo puedes demostrar de muchas maneras lo mas importante es que lo que hagas sea porque quieres, se muy cari?osa, abrazalo, mimalo, dale unas notitas con palabras bonitas, o dale un detalle sin que lo espere y sin ser una fecha especial, un chocolate, tarjetas,  ahora si que depende  de tu imaginacion.|`|n6ZPGtIHaa	no le compres un poni|`|nRjsuz3zaa	el lo notara se tu misma y se daracuenta que lo amas realmente<br>  e intensamente|`|iKzZ8Cfqaa	La unica solucion, bueno que yo veria encuanto a mi forma de ser, seria que dejes pasar un poco el tiempo, y el poco a poco se va a dar cuenta que realmente lo quieres, y trata de hacer lo mejor que puedas, tu da lo mejor, per tambien no te dejes caer en la trampa del amor, ya que el amor tiene dos coraz, tanto te puede dar la bueno como la mala, si realmente el no te valora, significa que nunca fuiste de el y tienes que sacarlo por fuerza y seguir adelnte por que la vida sigue corriendo, no dejes pasar oportunidaddes, pero piensa lo que quieras hacer.|`|RypI9XAGaa	El amor diario, atencion, comprencion, hacerlo sentir bien, y decirselo cuando te nasca..

With the distance that separates you two, even though you may have been inseparable at one time, there's no way you can meet her friendly needs at this time so you have been relegated to the back burner of friendship, That burner waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay in the back. Chalk it up as a good friendship that grew up and apart due to lack of ease. Use the energy that you're wasting on this unresponsive girl and put it towards meeting some new people, that may have time for friendship.Maybe if you show less care to keep in contact, she might fill the void, if not don't worry about it. Take care and good luck babe,<br>  <br>                                                                    askaman|`|cSQgIRAVaa	If you belive that she's still your friend than she is,and No she's very wrong with her attitude.As a friend you should confront her and ask her why is she ignoring you that way. Dont feel bad about it and try to make new friends 'cause friendship has no limit or time.Keep going on with your life and stay happy.|`|AA11845810	I will be straight forward with you! Apparently your 'friend' no longer wants to be bothered with you! And as bad as that may seem, it just maybe the truth. If she was and still is your friend, you never would have been ignored. I had a similar experience. When I moved 5 hours away from where I grew up, I only had two friends that would call me. Whenever I came back to visit, I would rarely go see either one of them. Instead I'd go and visit all of thoes 'friends' that would not call me. I finally woke up and said I'm tired of this being a one way friendship. Take my advice, once you stop communicating with her, if she was ever a true friend, she'll start calling you!|`|YdlIobehaa	Maybe she is really just very busy and has a lot on her mind, which makes her forget to reply to you.  I would just back off a bit and give her some space.  I would still send a message on her birthday or any other holiday that is important, just to let you know she is still on your mind but I wouldn't keep making regular contact w/her.  I would just sit back and see if she gets in contact w/you.  Perhaps after awhile, she'll realize that she hasn't heard from you in a bit and she'll pick up the phone and call.  If not, then I would let it go and move on.  Good luck, I hope everything works out.|`|jPDf1992aa	As we grow older, a lot of friendships are lost. Not because we want to, but because time, work and new responsibilities causes us to do so. <br>   She probably is busy, and I dont think she wants to hurt your feelings . Without accusation, ask her how she feels. It's normalthat you won't see her as often, and things won't be the same as before when you where teengagers and had all the time in the world, but you can definatly still be friends. There are no age for friends.<br>  <br>  Ask her, it's the best thing I could suggest you to do. If you do nothing, nothing will happen.|`|JGZfcytYaa	I think you should still consider her a friend, but maybe not as close as you used to be.  Still wish her happy birthday, and call/text her occasionally, but also focus on getting some new BFFs

u6XqbPVYaa	I think it must be babies that have baths, they dont sweat as much and seem to smell so nice!<br>  i always thought babies smelt nice just by being babies but my friend has a little one and baths her about twice a week if that. and leaves her in the same clothes for sometimes 2 days. She doesnt smell nice. so i put it down to baby lotions, soaps, nappies and those babies who are bathed and clean!!|`|F1YkUTRJaa	hah same with a new car.|`|svGcR1aWaa	I think its because they are little and cute.  It prevents us from eating them. jk
AA11526055	Depends on the girl. Most guys get paranoid when their hair starts falling out. <br>  Honestly it just makes them look like they are in their early 30's, not their early 20's, so maybe you should aim older? ;)|`|nDN7v1Xvaa	Any woman who's worth your time won't care about that kind of thing. I've dated several men who were bald or almost bald, men in their 20's. I never cared. It sounds cliche, but I only cared about who they were as a person. Plus, some of them were rather stunning.

Maybe theres a reason why he went to hang out with his guy friends and not her. Tell her to chill on the drama.
nE7CTuOxaa	I'm totally the same, and I like when the guy asks the girl out. Ask one of his friends to hint towards asking you out. If that doesn't work, start flirting with him until you become so unresistable that he can't help but ask you out. Good luck!|`|54e32e2d813f209ebbd4d1bfcea38a50aa	Ask him out... I did and I'm married to him 35 yr's now. :)|`|47468bdc67cc5dc4d7e6f432c7550ce5aa	Give him hints. but anyways you answered one of my ? and i'm not sure if u just didn't notice it but i said i did straighten it ok.|`|4OEnHRCBaa	i would ask him because maybe he is the quiet person and if he knows you like him he might be scared to ask you so take chances and have no regrets.... =)
XtxhfJRWaa	No don't tell him.Just continue to be friends with him.If it's meant to be more tahn friends it will be God's will.So pray about it and see where the Lord leads you two.|`|6u5v0stlaa	I think that you should tell him!! But when you do, tell him that the reason that you haven't told him is because you count on him to be your friend. And don't forget to be yourself!!! If he's looking for a perfect christian than its up to you if you want to become a better christian. But I am sure that he isn't because he probably has enough of that at home. But who knows I was in this same predicament a couple of weeks ago and i told him. We dated for a couple of weeks and than called it quits but he is still one of my best friends.|`|97432e56e9d86807b64a125ef82038e3aa	yes|`|IAi8Yzeeaa	Well, I've never been very good at this sort of thing, but let me think.<br>  <br>  I vote you try to just stay friends. I know that may be hard for you, but in the end, maybe you ARE to young. I promised myself I wouldn't get a boyfriend until I was fifteen or sixteen, and even then I promised myself that he would be a christian. But that ain't the issue here. :] Anyways, why don't you just become good friends with him now, but not so much so that you both start to get tired of being around each other? If he's moving at any point, then... maybe then you could tell him, and continue to contact him over e-mail and an Instant Messenger, that way you can keep in touch. Hmm... Yeah, this is a toughie, though. :< Sorry if I wasn't to much of a help.|`|OgnPYu3Yaa	I'm telling you, just go for it, don't care about his rejection or anything just tell him, then he will realize what a great girl you ares!|`|aa1002588ab1c0c4f05c9b862bc9c129aa	keep droping hints dont just tell him|`|06d3e397e3130db07fe148a9d02b1781aa	Tell him.  If he isn't interested, its that much sooner you can move on.  The longer you wait, the harder its going to be.

tfKcmaeraa	I was in this situation.<br>  <br>  He asked her out. She didn't seem all that interested, but I was in LOOOVE with him.<br>  <br>  I kept it to myself, and they eventually broke up (after maybe... 5 weeks?)<br>  <br>  Soon, I started hanging out with him (without her around), and we got closer and closer. One night we all went to the fair, and he kissed me on the ferris wheel. A week later we started dating, and we're still together. It's been almost 1 year and 5 months.<br>  <br>  If you're meant to be with him, everything will fall into place.|`|1e9d3b83ee4eab612b90db60f5cea95daa	Go get your own boyfriend... there are plenty of decent guys out there, and you'll ruin your friendship badly.|`|TuWckDJAaa	If your in love with him, take it slowly.....if she doesnt look like she likes him, nows your chance, make a move .

I mean, everyday until I left at 16....Years later I've found I can thank her, not for being the sweet mom I wish she would have been, but for showing me how 'not to treat others'. I have a heart of compassion for those who grow up in bad environments because of what I went through. I'm a survivor of trauma and I can give comfort to so many others...<br>  <br>  Think, "Thanks dad, for showing me what not to be..." You see, we can learn from everything.

oYstPvmnaa	As you say, you're a great and kind guy, right? The hurdle is getting a girl to find out how great, funny, etc. you are. The first step is talking to a girl.<br>  <br>  Use any ice breaker to open the conversation. What you say is a lot less important than HOW you say it. Confidence is key. I like to use funny pick up lines to show that I have a sense of humor and open up the opportunity for playful banter. There are a bunch at the site below.|`|gvbjSdy3aa	Find a buddy with some experience and watch and talk to him.
itujo1Vxaa	I'm going to assume that you're younger than 40 and you don't have major health problems that affect your appearance. Since you two haven't had to deal with a situation like that before, it's not really fair to question whether you want to stay with him. It's understandable for a young healthy person to feel a little weird thinking about his g/f with only one boob. Older people who face the possibility of serious illnesses that can cause someone to have a breast removed might be less weirded out and more supportive.<br>  <br>  What I'm trying to say is, he most likely still loves you, but because he probably hasn't known many people who have only one breast, it's a new and strange idea to him. I'm sure if you ended up with an illness where you needed to have one removed, he'd support you and be more understanding than you think. But let's hope you don't have to deal with that; remember your monthly breast self-exams!|`|LUeNalMLaa	I really think its great that he was so honest with you. If some malformity does happen to your body, im sure he will get used to it and love you still, dont give up on the relationship if that is the only problem.|`|lYnf1j9qaa	Well he is right. Dating someone with one breast can be weird. But that doesn't mean you still wouldn't be able to love that person.<br>  I don't think he's shallow. He's very honest. That's a good thing!|`|0YPNiIZLaa	dump him or tell him your feelings

Just a guess, I don't know what her deal is, she's probobly confused on what she wants. Either way she's seeing another man. You deserve better than that, someone who wants you and ONLY you. Move on, maybe going away to college will give you a fresh start so you can meet new people.|`|AA12342572	I know that sux hun but she will and is using you. You answered your own question. Shes not worth it and she contradicts herself. You are going away and growing up and she isnt. She wants to be with simple minded people. You are moving  on and there will be many females that are at the same level and mind frame as you. Leave her alone. You are no ones "waitor". <br>  Hope this helps <br>  Happy holidays|`|LTSX3Iduaa	Dang. Its a tough one. I think that she is going through a stage which some people might  see as social withdrawl. A persons personality may change due to something drastic (like a decieced mother or poor influences by friends). Just know she hasn't fully gone off the deep end and is in shallow waters where you can save your relationship. Just try to start things up and try to show her you care.

4379a92f1f09d1481c76b6cfc44ceb3caa	Just tell her how you feel. Maybe even explain some of your feelings to her, why and such. If you liked each other before, then she probably still holds a little spot for you in her heart. So just ask her. Sure, she could say no and you'd be heartbroken.

aSORSU9Jaa	Greetings. I know what you are going through, because the same thing happened to me. I was in a 7 year relationship and it just ended this jan. I tried to commit suicide and have been on anti-depressants. At the end, it wasn't worth it. My friends and family have been my constant support. My advice to you is this, TAKE ONE DAY AT A TIME. DON'T LOOK TO THE PAST. DON'T ASK YOURSELF, WELL IF I WOULD HAVE DONE THIS DIFFERENTLY, KEEP YOUR MIND BUSY. GO TO THE BEACH, READ A BOOK, OR PLAY MUSIC. I know it's not easy, believe me. But eventually you will move on. Things happen for a reason. You will meet someone who will love you better and respect you better as well. Never question that which comes to mind. I hope I have been of some help to you. I wish you all the best.<br>  <br>  peace profound,<br>  davincimind|`|2mWc6M9Caa	Life is like that ,but you have to move eon and look for the real person that is meant for you.

Good luck! :)|`|AA12363568	I know what your going through, it is very hard. Until you find someone else that makes you feel special, it will be extremely hard to deal with. You will go on and time will heal your wounds but it happens to all of us unfortunately. There is no magic potion to make it easier, but spending time with friends and other guys will help!|`|Df8yO6zdaa	Once you love someone, they will always be in your heart forever.

It always takes time.|`|wTuwkjDDaa	Get ur mind off him and start meeting new guys but just as friends then move on to the next stage a date someone else, that will get ur mind off of the person u once loved.|`|EaokY2C0aa	It can be so hard to handle the aftermath of a break-up but you have to remember that you two are not together anymore for a reason. Its OK to be sad for a long time just don't let yourself get so unhappy that you neglect yourself. Go out, have fun, whenever you think of this person you love then smile to yourself and think of one good thing about him and then one bad thing and then do something else to get your mind off of him. Ask your friends to take you out and distract you with a fun day. Keep taking things a day at a time and let yourself get over him at your own pace. Don't force him out like he's the plague, you obviously thought he was great and you can look back on him later in life and be glad you knew him.|`|FSVGnFkdaa	I can completely relate to you. I was with my ex for about 3 years and i can say i was really in-love with him, i mean HEAD OVER HEELS. but the down side of our relationship, is he was a complete cheater. So if your ex was like that, then think about the negative things that he put you through and see if he has more negative than positive, because there is no guy who has the right to treat you with disrespect. If he wasnt like that, then think about why your family and friends decide you should move on...and why you agree! there must be somthing that he did to ruin the trust and friendship he had. I mean, all women deserve someone better for them if they have had someone ruin it all. I have moved on to a great man and i think about my ex 0%...he doesnt even exist to me because I am very much in love with my boyfriend Chris now. You shuold sit down and think about it. and if ur still unsure. Think about why ur family and friends want him out of ur life and why they seriously want you to move on. I mea, who knows...you might just find your prince Charming like i did...GOOD LUCK!!!|`|4TiWZLKXaa	With time this will heal, You've probably heard that to. It is true though you will have to give it some time. Try taking up running or speed walking some kind of exercise this helps and friends do help.

9ab26c5c4c37f60ca306fe657158cdbcaa	its not something i proudly admit but im vain and superficial. not as much as i was when i was in high school but i am still the same even now only to a lesser degree. but you wouldnt be able to tell that with the boyfriend i have. who by the way i adore more then anyone esle ive ever been with. we've been together since my senior year in high school and we're still very close a year later. and i tell you this because it has to do with your question so please just bear with me. <br>  in high school i only ever hooked up with guys with the body, the faces, athletes, and even the surfer guys who had the perfect hair. i was that terrible where looks of my guys had alot to do with why i was with them. but one day a few days before graduation during lunch something that could only happen in movies happened to me. dominic the class outcast and what you would consider the "nerd" of my class walked up to my table, climbed to the top of the table and loudly shouted he liked me. he didnt look at me when he said it but he yelled it out loud twice just to make sure everyone heard. then he looked down at my shocked face and said i like you, i like you. then he got down and walked out of the cafeteria. i was shocked to say the least. you can imagine my stunned expression. and the echo that followed after him. <br>  we were together after that. i couldnt forget him. all i could think was wow he did that for me. what he did toke so much courage and damn. what a guy. my guy. no one could ever do something like that for me. im so proud to call him mine. after that confession incident every girl in the school wanted to get to know jordon. they all wanted to met and date the guy who could do something so cool like that. <br>  to end it. girls want that. we cant resist someone who is so honest and upfront. and daring and aggresive. i know that sounds alot but really?  girls just wanna feel 100 percent that you are the one. that they are worth fighting for. and to feel in a word speacil. <br>  jordon said he had tried to do everything to get my attention. i never even knew he had made such attempts. i was that blind. he forced my eyes open. he made me see that he was speacil. thats what girls want. <br>  im not saying you should do that. but if someone is worth it then its worth doing something about it.|`|424c482c80662a48da225503a70ba9e3aa	you could try screaming and waving road flares at us.<br>  <br>  sometimes you guys are too subtle and don't notice. be blunter and make sure you get noticed... don't just end up blending in.|`|VhSxPD4Taa	Maybe you've already got our attention.

a45c2cc73915d245be2735d9c1260381aa	There r way to many signs to just have one clear one because guys show how they feel in many diff ways...<br>  <br>  *How to tell if he likes you<br>  (and if he's flirting with you in his special own guy-way).<br>  <br>  A lot depends on the type of guy and his individual personality.<br>  <br>  Shy Guys<br>  These are tough to crack sometimes...<br>  *He'll look at you, until you turn around, then boom, he's looking the other way.<br>  You may 'feel' like he's watching you - but he's hard to catch at it<br>  <br>  * He may do something physical - like grab you in a play way, poke you, play with your hair...<br>  (Remember when you were really young and the guy you liked punched you or tackled you?)<br>  <br>  *He may be working really hard to pay attention to you, but doesn't quite know how...<br>  <br>  *He may ask a friend of yours about you - he'll say it's just for "friend of mine" that wants to know about you.<br>  <br>  *He talks to everybody else - but when you're around he turns silent, or chokes up.<br>  You seem to accidentally bump into him a lot of different places.<br>  <br>  *He may not say a word to you, but he shows up in the same line, at the same movie, etc.<br>  <br>  *He'll give you a little smile from across the room, but if you get near, he won't look up.<br>  Basically - the BIG clue is that his behavior changes when you're around (compared to when he's around his buds or other girls).<br>  DEAD Giveaway - when you talk to him he turns red.<br>  (Bingo - you can pack that puppy up and take him home...)<br>  <br>  These are some of the more subtle clues - keep your eyes open - you may have more guys flirting with you than you realize!!!<br>  <br>  *He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.<br>  It may take you by surprise. You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, you like orange fizz..."<br>  <br>  *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.<br>  <br>  *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.<br>  <br>  Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.<br>  <br>  *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...<br>  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)<br>  <br>  When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)<br>  <br>  *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)<br>  <br>  *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'<br>  <br>  If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.<br>  <br>  *He tells you that you smell nice...<br>  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)<br>  <br>  *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.<br>  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue.<br>  <br>  If you ever need anything else feel free to email me @: godsbaby42@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  *Much LOve* ~God Bless~|`|6XHZSN5Haa	He has crabs because he has nailed every other bimbo in school.|`|AA11528526	At 11 you shouldn't really need any, but if you must, don't overdo it.

efbf296dac18565e03f476fbab21e884aa	First off you friends should not be mad at you for being happy they should be happy for you. If they were true friends they would never let a guy come between you friendship. Try going out as a group event you and all your boyfriends go somewhere fun. Talk to them to find out why thay stop being your friend in the first place. If they have no boyfriend get you boyfriend to get some of his friends and you all go out together hopefully they will find inteterst in one of them. You gotta ask yourself which is the most important friends who have no care about your happiness or living your life being happy with a person who treats you like the queen you are?|`|BwzcEQcRaa	Need more info to help you.|`|44ab537503b323dcb61fd2a3b8221f88aa	well try talking to ur friensd during class/ online.|`|Ct25uB1Daa	well if your lover is being very over bearing on you like controlling and telling you you cant have friends then maybe you should be a rebel and go out and get you some friends they arent hard to find just look over your shoulder and there will be a friend on your side|`|EBbfRglHaa	new friends|`|yfjcM6Hgaa	if your friends arnt happy that your in a good relationship then they are not friends. find other friends ones that wont be jealous because their life isnt as good as someone elses.

He is in love and Bonnie and her kids has become his life.  This type of thing has happened to kids when the man is their own father, so it is not surprising that it would happen to you when he is only your uncle. Maybe before Bonnie he really did not have much personal life, so he had a lot of time for you, more than most uncles have for their nephews.  But now he does have a life and he is busy.  Also, he may think it is not that important as you and your cousins probably have your own fathers.  I am sorry this is happening to you, but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for things to change.  He has other responsibilities in his life now.  Some day Bonnie could be his wife and he could end up being step father to her kids.  You may not like it, but his responsibilities are going to be to them, not your and your cousins.  That does not make him a bad man or an uncaring man, just a very busy man with a lot to do, and he can't do everything he used to do anymore.|`|KV2TN3PPaa	talk to him about what is going on. tell him how you feel about it.|`|QrmbtnQaaa	it sucks.<br>  families suck sometimes. but if he is doing it and not caring you have to learn to stop caring. He will wake up one day and be so sorry he has done this because he wont have Bonnie or anyone else and then he will come back. But by this time you will have to work out whether or not you can forgive him.<br>  I would stop trying. Its not worth the heartache|`|VDyPQ8lTaa	i think you shoudl get a really mean girl friend and like ignore him and send christmas cards of you  and your really mean girl friend<br>  <br>  <br>  lol i am just kidding... but you could call him and talk to him...<br>  and when that doesnt work... tell your uncle she is cheating on him for another woman..... get em' on springer... that'll break em up//<br>  <br>  and if he like the lesbian thing and is okay with it.....<br>  change your story really quick and tell him it's for your bestfriend... a guy.... idk .... just try it....<br>  rayfacegreenface@yahoo.com|`|wEml8HVWaa	I think that you should explain to him how you feel.

Although he may have trouble listening, there'll be at least one thing that will come across to him if you really make a strong point, even if it's just one.|`|zDX2rXMPaa	No really advices mate! The things just happen! Your uncle fell in love when most of people aren't able to behave as before. Your uncle carries on his new relationship, and you have to wait - it's a high probability that after some time the all things will come back to its way. No panic! It's hard, but that's the live we live. :)
BisUpJX3aa	I would think that she is going to her homestate to visit her family and she invited him to go along with.. Wouldnt you want your family to meet your gf?

He also starts to be more concerned about things that relate to her and she will always tell the difference. However I am of the opinion that you have nothing to lose by telling the guy how you feel then  you know exactly how he feels. The worst that could happen is that he will say he is not interested.

NvBHVpgjaa	For a very hard situation like this the answer is simple.  Be a friend.  Don't act differently.  Don't think about it.  Just BE there.  Listen.  Talk.  Distract.  He needs some fun; that’s where you come in.  Make this easier on him by taking him out and making forget for a while.  If he wants to discuss his father with you, let him!  You don't have to say anything: just listen and give support.  Make sure you tell him you're there for him!  Just be the great friend you are, and together you can make this easier for the both of you.  I hope this helps!  This is what I would do if this happened to one of my friends.  Good luck...|`|1c077d6087458fcba75aa76346d52ad4aa	just be there for him ....let him talk , let him get it out you don't really have to say anything and sometimes its better if you  just sit there he will do the talking ... for both of you and thats what best friends are for ...being there|`|AA10420250	if i were you i wouldn't say anything i would let them tell you what ever they want... nothing you say will ever change their feelings/pain|`|HObPuBhaaa	Its a hard time for him and its possible that anything you say could just upset him.

I know if my best friend lost his dad, I'd just be there for him and do whatever I can to help him, even if its just sitting with him for hours and listening to anything he has to say. Good luck.|`|JLmh4Ctkaa	hes having a really hard time right now. do things taht he likes and it may make him cheer up a little!|`|MbAupQALaa	Just tell him that - that you don't know what to say, and you are sorry, and that you are there to listen when he needs to talk.

tFs5DU1Oaa	It sounds like your wife's parents have already taken the hint so I wouldn't even mention it to them, besides they won't go unless they are invited I'm sure so just don't invite them.. I am sure they wouldn't be hurt.  As for your wife.. you need to first reassure her that you love her parents (even if you don't haha) and then tell her that when you go to visit your own parents that you would like to spend that time alone with them especially since you see her parents often and yours not so much.  She should understand, if she doesn't then you need to get harsher and put your foot down about it.  Whoever it upsets then so be it.. they will get over it.|`|SqrPpm5Daa	Exactly how you said it here but you should only need to bring it up with your wife as she's the one extending the invitation to her parents.  Just be sure to find a quiet time to talk to her about it when neither of you is stressed.  Then maybe add that since the families get along so well you can plan entire family vacations too, just not every time.|`|juRWvc0eaa	Wow... that is tough.... I would start by commenting how nice it is the family gets to spend so much quality time with JUST her parents. After a couple of comments, when you want to go see yours again, mention how beneficial you think it would be for your family to get some time like that with JUST your parents. If you bring that up to JUST your wife BEFORE she can invite her parents, you might be able to slip out of town to go see them without the in laws tagging along. Unless they LIVE with you, they aren't obligated to go on EVERY trip, so they should not be insulted that they were not invited.<br>  Please let us know how it turned out... I'd be curious to keep up with that saga.
W8OPY0Bcaa	The sad/funny fact about the situation is this: If you have a guy who fell in love with you first, you would not want him nearly as much as a man who took his time. In light of this paradox, it is likely that none of the answers anyone gives here will satisfy you.|`|0aad220f1b8363a29d4dcc8389475efeaa	It doesnt.<br>  <br>  A guy doesnt take a long time to fall in love, they take a long time to say it.<br>  <br>  Most guys I know scared to fall in love BECAUSE its easy to. They take a long time because they dont lightly toss that word around like some females do.<br>  <br>  More females seem to use that word when a feeling comes up... but may be unsure.<br>  <br>  More guys say it and they mean it.<br>  <br>  PLUS, it takes most guys a LOT longer to fall OUT of love with someone that a girl. So they are probably wiser to be mroe careful about it.|`|Pt0KMY9oaa	no sometimes guys like me are scared because doesnot want to get hurt again like 3 years ago....but i am afraid of the one that is very beutiful and kind with a big heart and i dont want to make a mistake of not knowing whos the one.....|`|juRWvc0eaa	Believe it or not, many guys have a soft heart deep down, and don't wanna get hurt either. Others know that women are generally more suspicious about guys who say that because of all the jerk that use that line to get girls into the sack. Those guys don't wanna say it until they are absolutely certain.|`|dDGlJKgCaa	Guys take longer to fall in love, but longer to fall out of love.<br>  Girls take shorter to fall in love, but fall out of love faster.
6AuD6ZFfaa	it sounds like he's dealing with some issues. when he's ready he'll move forward with a relationship. It may or may not be with you but if you really care about the guy then just be his friend for now. He will have to learn to trust you as a friend....and then possibly as a girlfriend. some people are very complicated and it's not all black and white. The only thing i can tell you not to do is smoother him. don't call him all the time. just let him know you're there for him and he'll eventually open up more.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Normally I would say move on. You're young and shouldn't have to settle for a non-relationship with someone that has some serious issues but your situation is all to farmiliar to me and I can only speak from my own situation. <br>  First of all having strong feelings for someone and not being able to act on them is soooo hard!! You will have to have a whole lotta self control. If you tell him that you want to be friends then YOU are the one who will have to make that happen. It'll be very difficult and weird but you have to keep your emotions in check. don't get jealous if he's hanging out with other people, don't get upset that he didn't answer the phone or he didn't return your call. Don't take it personally when he doesn't reach out to you. He sounds like my guy, the kind that doesn't 'reach out' to anyone and keeps everything to himself. just make sure that when you tell him you're ok with being friends and you're gonna be there for him, that you really are. you have to blow him away with your sincerity and commitment to the friendship. <br>  <br>  Have you two talked about your age difference? That could be a reason in addition to the other things he's dealing with, that he may be holding back. <br>  <br>  It is possible for you two to have a very strong and healthy friendship that can be the foundation of your future together but for his sake you should decide now what you are willing to do for him and when enough is enough. You may want to set some boundries for yourself.... for example: Only call him 2 times and if he doesn't answer or call back then you wait for him. it could be 2 days or 2 weeks. But, it's important that you do set some sort of guidelines for youself because in such an uncertain relationship, if you're like me you're gonna need to feel like you have control of something and it could help to keep your emotions in check.<br>  <br>  the only other thing i can comment on is when you say that you guys kiss. I know a kiss is just a kiss but to some people it's so much more!! I asked him to NOT kiss me and it was one of the hardest things I've done cause of course I want it but it only made it harder for me to keep in control of my emotions. He agreed that it wasn't fair for him to be able to express his feelings for me in a physical way but was unable to commit to me. I just told him that I didn't want to just settle for what i could get from him and I would wait until he was ready to give me all (emotional and physical) Most people would think that was crazy but I know he respects me for it and he has NO doubt that I respect him. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|UAFrUh7Daa	he is playing games with ur head.....girl move on cuz u better then that....|`|ffad5ab4c275dfd425e1298a91896995aa	life is short and the best way to get a guy out of his shell is to show him that he is the one you want but also make it be known that if he doesn't act soon there are other guys that would leap at a chance to get to know you show him that he shouldn't let his chance to be with you get away in a nice and round about way let him know other men are into you not necessarily that you return the feelings but that way he'll see what a catch you are|`|yzee4Q5daa	tell him it hurts when he doesn't call. and maybe he is just afraid to have a girlfriend. explain to him you are afriad just as well and you would really like it if he called you but you could also call him. just talk to each other and if it doesn't work out just be good friends.|`|juRWvc0eaa	Shy guys need time. There seems to be a good foundation here, and you should focus on that and take things SLOW. If you really love him, then wait for him. He will come along once he learns he can trust you, and trust takes time to build. Good Luck.|`|dpRsbyGjaa	There are a lot of things you can do, but this is not the place to say them. Now if that statement above brings anything to your mind, then act on them. You might be glad you did.<br>  <br>  PEACE
g6dIJmCLaa	Well, if she has your #, but you didn't give it to her..She probably likes you, got it from your sister because she is too shy to ask you for it. Just be casual about it. Call her and ask her if she wants to go to a movie with you if shes free. Talk to your sister about her to find out more about her.. see what her likes and dislikes are.. ask your sister if she ever talks about you. <br>  <br>  When you see her with her friends don't be afraid to go up and say hello really quick.(shes with her friends and you don't want to take up too much of her time.. just see how she is and tell her you'll talk to her later and let her get back to w/e she was doing). I would be thoroughly impressed with a guy who could approach me with all my friends around. Talk to her when you can, just don't smother her.. Be flirty and spontaneous.. you know send her a little gift or something.. <br>  <br>  My best bet would be to see what you can milk out of your sister and go from there :]|`|juRWvc0eaa	Dude, just ask her out.

UmoG5bHVaa	Mi dispiace profondamente del tuo dolore ed amarezza.<br>  Sono una mamma , amo profondamente i miei figli e sono consapevole di aver commesso degli errori (non so quali ma sono certa di averne fatti).<br>  Penso che un figlio sia il fiume, il genitore l'argine che lo deve accompagnare  fino al ragiungimento del mare. L'errore grave di noi genitori è di costruire troppe dighe.<br>  Pochi giorni fà parlavo con una giovane donna che ha perso la mamma. Poverina, piangeva molto e mi diceva :"Sai qual'è il mio grande rammarico? Lei stava morendo ed io non l'ho abbracciata....non me lo aveva insegnato.

Se stai vicino a tuo figlio sei apprensivo e non gli lasci spazio, se lo lasci libero non ti preoccupi per lui. Dunque qualsiasi cosa fai sbagli. Di solito è normale che i figli si arrabbino con i genitori. Se hai bisogna di risposte cerca di parlare con loro. Se proprio sfuggono prova con una lettera.|`|Djcpq9Jtaa	tu nn centri niente la colpa è loro quello che tu potresti fare mi pare di aver capito che lo tenti...quindi ignorali tanto un giorno verranno loro da te e la poi regisci come ti preferisci...|`|IOb1gH6Gaa	Un giorno diventerai genitore anche tu ...e....CAPIRAI!|`|J0wrnbUxaa	Devi provare a fargli capire il tuo disagio... loro si chiudono a riccio magari esteriormente ma ti posso assicurare che in realtà ti ascoltano e credo che qualunque genitore provi dolore di fronte ad un figlio che non si sente capito... alcuni sono più portati ad ascoltare ed altri meno. Questo è un dato di fatto e nessuno può farci nulla... L'unica soluzione è il provare a mettersi nei loro panni e capire perchè si comportano in questo modo. Io non so la loro situazione ma solitamente le persone tendono a riflettere da grandi quello che hanno vissuto nell'infanzia... magari loro, come te, quando erano piccoli non sono stati capiti o contrariamente, sono stati troppo soffocati ed ora per non far vivere ai figli quello che hanno vissuto loro raggiungono l'altro estremo... Le persone vanno capite in fondo e non bisogna limitarsi all'apparenza... Sii forte e anche se è strano perchè non provi a capirli tu? Non essere arrabbiata con loro... Non credo che facciano apposta quello che fanno... Come ti ho già detto nessun genitore si diverte a far male ai propri figli... Se lo fanno, non lo fanno sicuramente apposta... Ognuno di noi ha un percorso dietro... e quello che siamo oggi è solo frutto di un lungo cammino che è cominciato da ieri...<br>  Spero di esserti stata utile o almeno di averti fatto riflette...<br>  Ciao|`|S6KarKnraa	Non è facile essere genitori, purtoppo nessuno ci insegna a farlo nel modo corretto<br>  Cerca di perdonarli e di vedere ciò che di bello hanno fatto per te, sicuramente hanno cercato di darti più di quello che sono riusciti a comunicarti.<br>  Non portare rancore nei loro confronti perchè quando un giorno mancheranno i ricordi belli verranno fuori da se e capirai che a modo loro hanno avuto una grande importanza.<br>  Un genitore non si sostituisce con nessun altra cosa|`|dcvQoGWpaa	Già i buoni consigli spesso sono quelli che dovete fare quello che vi pare senza rispettare le regole che hanno imposto i vostri genitori, quello che fanno per voi non basta mai, dice bene chi dice: meglio vivere per conto proprio, così potete tranquillamente uscire e rientrare a casa senza orari, tanto il punto della questione è sempre questo, un genitore non ascolta e non vale più niente solo per le vostre trasgressioni, siete molto abili nel far sentire i vostri genitori dei falliti e cancellare con un colpo di spugna tutto quello che hanno fatto. E' giusto che quando le cose arrivano a questo punto andate a vivere per conto vostro (scusami ma questo è rivolto a quelli che hanno risposto prima di me).<br>  A te vorrei dirti di parlare sempre perchè il dialogo è importante, un figlio sa benissimo la propria situazione famigliare e nessuno meglio di te sa come comportarti, ho capito chiaramente che ami i tuoi genitori perciò coraggio perchè se ti hanno insegnato ad amarli vuol dire che ti hanno amato, abbracciali digli loro che gli vuoi bene e fagli capire che hai tanto bisogno di loro in questo momento.<br>  Ciao permettimi di abracciarti.|`|gGIvxa6Maa	caspita mi dispiace x la tua situazione...ma l'unica cosa da fare è parlarci...hai detto ke s kiudono a riccio quando gli parli...ma prima o poi si devono aprire...t auguro tanta fortuna baci|`|8d703337aee9435014dfaae831b2f989aa	non potendoli obbligare a darti spiegazioni devi scegliere se continuare a vivere con loro o se prendere un'altra strada.

juRWvc0eaa	Ask to have lunch with her parents so that you can get to know them. Maybe see if your family and hers could do some joint outings. I don't know of any parent that wouldn't give a guy a chance if they wanted the parents to get to know that he was really responsible. If all you ask them for is a fair shake, unless they are extremely unreasonable, you should get your chance to show them that you really care about their daughter.|`|EKptCXPsaa	No matter what you do if they are determined that they don't want her to be in a relationship, then they are going to go against it. It sounds lame, but the only thing you can do is be yourself and wait it out. If they see that you're the type to stick around they might start warming up to the idea of her having a boyfriend. Remember that whatever they do is because they love their daughter.

juRWvc0eaa	So lemme get this straight... There is a guy that likes you, and you think this is a bad thing? What the heck? Why not give the guy a chance? Get to know him for him. All he can ask for is a fair shake. - Look, you may be surprised if you were to give him a chance. You might find out he is an amazing guy.|`|AA12157752	first, just assess whether he’s right for you. if it is just plain fear but is the sort of guy you would like, then give him a chance. If you don’t like him at all, all you can do is show him that you treat him the way you treat everyone the same! e.g. talk to him in front of a group of friends, switch your attention to someone else and be nice to them. <br>  If he come right up to ask you out, tell him that he’s a really nice guy and he deserves someone who appreciates him. Just not you because you like the both of you friends better. Either way, when he sees the rejection, he’ll be a little hurt of course, but he’ll respect you for the person you are if he’s a friend.<br>  <br>  look at it this way. people rather you do it quick rather than lead them on to more hope and get cut off abruptly. Good luck!|`|03bb226f38059b0635b6d5774b81925daa	Somewhere down the line, all of us girls are encountered with that guy who likes us, but we don't much care for. We dread it when they bring up "boyfriend and girlfriend" situations. We practice in front of the mirror what excuse we're going to say if they ask us out. And we calculate which way we're going to run when he tells us he "really" likes us. What we're going to say to his friends who do the talking for him and so on. We even lie and say we already have boyfriends and for even more dramatic effect, we even say we're gay if it's bad enought (kidding)<br>  <br>  We tell guys we would want to be friends, but most just won't get it. They think if they keep pressing the girl wil eventually "change her tune". <br>  Lay the line down now and tell him you will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever like/love him. It may hurt him, but you have to be stern with these kinds of boys. <br>  You say you don't want to hurt him. You'd be hurt to if someone you really loved, admire and fantasize about just slams the door in your face. Just get it over with, hon.|`|wqbXPytuaa	what's the problem?if he's someone that you sure you wont like 100% then just give him a good reason....dont let him hang there, questioning it.
QPahJ6Oraa	paix?o prescinde o amor, pois é um sentimento de encantamento, de êxtase que nos deixa enfeiti?ados e “tomados”. Enquanto que o amor, também concordam, vem após a paix?o; é como se a paix?o fosse o clímax da agonia da Fênix e o amor a sensa??o de renova??o ao renascer das cinzas. <br>  Na realidade, o amor é algo tranqüilo, sereno e ao mesmo tempo forte e sólido. Algo que n?o depende do humor nem do desejo e n?o está sujeito a chuvas e trovoadas. Sobrevive a rotina, a convivência, as crises financeiras, aos problemas materiais, físicos, familiares, de trabalho. Enfim, amar também é admirar, conviver, conhecer, partilhar, participar, dividir e aceitar ... O amor independe da distancia, n?o sucumbe as crises e n?o acaba. <br>  O que caracteriza a paix?o é a intensidade, o imediatismo (proximidade também), a falta de limites, o apego e, inclusive, um entusiasmo e admira??o exagerados em rela??o a pessoa querida. Quando estamos apaixonados criamos muita expectativa em torno do relacionamento e da pessoa de modo que acreditamos n?o existir obstáculos para a felicidade. Tudo isso porque a paix?o é cega e é, como afirmam alguns, um sentimento infantil porque pode ser comparada a rela??o m?e-bebê. Para o bebê há apenas ele e a m?e, e este comportamento eu-você (e para que existe o resto???) é muito comum nos apaixonados. <br>  E assim os apaixonados seguem sua senda: “nós dois e tudo pode ser enfrentado de frente e sem medos”. E logo o tempo passa e um dia aquela expectativa é confrontada com a realidade ent?o algo muda. Algo ocorre e se n?o há um sentimento genuíno ali, a paix?o simplesmente acaba porque n?o houve campo para o amor nascer, crescer e se instalar. N?o há realmente afinidades, só sobrevém os defeitos e o que se julga falha na outra pessoa. <br>  E se houver algo mais que paix?o, você entenderá a transforma??o da paix?o em amor, e perceberá que simplesmente "gosta" da outra pessoa, t?o simples e sublime ao mesmo tempo.|`|539270258a2b099d679d0208b6b2f0aeaa	Paix?o é uma coisa muuuuito forte! Mas tb muito instável e pode acabar logo. é um sentimento um pouco egoísta tb...<br>  <br>  Amor é uma coisa mais estável, em q vc pensa na pessoa amada acima de si mesmo, entende? é um sentimento bastante estável e por isso algumas pessoas dizem q é eterno.|`|Zkw7mPu5aa	amar - é para sempre<br>  paix?o - é por um certo tempo, curto ou longo|`|eef69c01cdd8b2c372418e7c7af583cbaa	amar é para sempre..sem limites<br>  e paixao uma hora acaba..sempre!|`|7kMIfOxzaa	existen dois tipos de amor  mais a paixao so a uma amar alguem nao é mesmo que estar apaixonada <br>  talo como|`|BZuADYBgaa	A paix?o é um sentimento t?o forte, que ti deixa bobo, cego e surdo, quando correspondido é muito bom, mas n?o deve durar mais que um ano, no máximo dois, se passar disso vira doen?a. Ela chega de repente, sem avisar, e vai embora da mesma forma. O amor é um sentimento que vai sendo construído aos poucos, é sólido, calmo , tranquilo, quando se ama, há confian?a em si mesmo, nada abala. é bem mais duradouro, nos dá paz, harmonia, n?o é egoista, quem ama de verdade, quer ver o bem da pessoa amada, independente de estar ou n?o com ela, quem ama é feliz com a felicidade da pessoa amada, mesmo distante de nós.|`|XQZ1prIQaa	paix?o é o divisor de águas entre o amor e o ódio onde  se vc n?o tomar cuidado pode se tornar algo doentio...<br>  o amor vc dar tudo de sí e ser correspondido′, ser companheiro, leal, sincero, afetuoso...|`|e19bf91a98fe77dbac525164d8790c1faa	Paix?o é um sentimento forte, que a gente precisa da pessoa por perto, queima mas como tempo acaba...<br>  Ja o amor, é mais calmo, quer estar com a pessoa mas quer vê-la bem... Faz de tudo pra agradar, e esse′ja é mais dificil de passar, demora a esquecer...|`|ea6fqzXLaa	Uma paix?o é mais egoísta e mais intensa que o amor. A paix?o é passageira, mas o amor dura. Muitas vezes o que come?a como paix?o pode virar amor. Quando você ama alguém de verdade se preocupa com a felicidade dela tanto quanto ou às vezes mais do que com a sua própria. Veja o amor dos pais por um filho que vai entender.|`|a43a6f47bb916d20d7a94d737d1c0cfdaa	A  paix?o  te rouba  a raz?o.. voce se torna abestado, age como um tolo,  esquece  de di mesmo, oprime o outro.. ela prejudica seu trabalho, seus relacionamentos sociais e familiares porque voce só pensa  na tal  pessoa... ela te enlouquece..  te faz sofrer... te torna  obsessivo.. possessivo ..  eu a chamo de, me perdoe a express?o, mas "amor de  pica".  .. mas fique tranquilo, dura pouco. .depois que ela  te deixar  no ch?o, lá no fundo de um  buraco emocional imenso, voce retoma seu brio (vergonha na cara) e volta  viver. Mas  é duro! <br>  Já  o amor é tranquilo... pede  licen?a  para entrar...  paciente.. generoso. .carinhoso..inteligente...  respeitador.. e se bem estruturado, se bem alimentado... pode durar uma eternidade  e lhe dar  muito prazer e até  felicidade. Enfim, é por aí.|`|TN0gxuODaa	Experimenta e depois vc vai entender muito bem.

Ate parece que existem mulheres sem problemas.|`|Xl5EJ6xgaa	Bom, problemas todo mundo tem e certamente vc tb tem os seus. Cabe vc avaliar se os problemas dela s?o insuportáveis p vc e se o que sente por ela é suficiente para tolerar todos esses conflitos. Tomar antidepressivos n?o é ter nenhuma doen?a grave, significa que ela está tentando se ajudar de alguma forma, e está precisando de medicamentos nesse momento. A depress?o pode e deve ser em decorrência disso tudo e com depress?o n?o tem quem fique animado com nada mesmo. Mas como vcs est?o se conhecendo há muito pouco tempo, talvez ainda haja pouco envolvimento e vc possa analisar a situa??o mais racionalmente e sem preconceitos. Boa Sorte!!!!|`|frdO0jEGaa	converse com ela fale que quer o bem dela <br>  e  quer ajudar ela<br>  <br>  se ela nao quiser sua ajuda <br>  tente-a esquece-la pq ela nom sente a mesma coisa que vc sente por ela<br>  nom é mesmo?<br>  <br>  flow abra?os|`|Bvpazi8saa	Se vc ? está se sentindo bem com essa situa??o e amizade o melhor é se afastar msm.

byPQnFfEaa	It's a little late now...<br>  <br>  Didn't you give this any consideration before you began dating your best friend's male friend? Didn't you talk this over with your best friend at all?<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you didn't which would make me believe you do not value your friendship as much as you think. <br>  <br>  Never ever date one of your friends or family members friends with out speaking to them directly. You have no idea if she has feelings for this male friend. She may be concerned that you will alienate her male friend and drive him away causing her to loose him as a friend or you as a friend.<br>  <br>  Should she be annoyed, you bet. Is she jealous, maybe, but you should have found out her opinion before you began dating.  <br>  <br>  Your friends are those who support you when you need them most. To abandon them, and ignore their feelings is not saying very much about you as her friend. Obviously if she is your best friend then you have a lot of time invested in that relationship, why would you want to throw that one away for a new one that is just beginning. <br>  <br>  As for the previous comment of your friend not interfering with your happiness, well you have in effect interfered with hers have you not? Does you best friend not bring you happiness? Are you willing to end your friend ship for a new one?|`|59a0fa8f145b4ae293fb219487a1c433aa	first u should ask Ur friend if she really likes him n if she does n if she doesn't talk 2 u then she wasn't really Ur friend|`|QbJr5Urmaa	no, i think that she's just jealous. if she was a true friend she would be supporting this union of her two best friends. so no, do not sacrifice your happiness to please her. what type of friend would that be if they made you do that? hmm?

Ct1iNbkVaa	How to Tell a Boy You Like Him<br>  <br>  If you have a crush on a boy then here are a few tips.<br>  [edit] Steps<br>  <br>     1. Give a few hints. Smile at him when you see him, look good when you walk by him, if he looks at you in class then he probably likes you back.<br>     2. Look at his friends. If he is with his friends and they are all looking at you then he probably likes you.<br>     3. Tell him. If you don't think he likes you then just build up the confidence and tell him.<br>     4. Tell a friend if you're scared. If you don't feel confident then tell a friend.<br>     5. Wait. If he has a girlfriend then you can't go out with him so you will just have to see what happens.<br>     6. Get to know him better. Maybe if he becomes your friend, he might notice who you really are.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Tips<br>  <br>      * The worst thing that can happen is rejection.<br>      * If your friends are acting weird about it, then maybe they know something that you don't know.<br>      * Just go for it and (with luck) everything will fall into place.<br>      * Talk to him in a way that you feel confident in.<br>      * I know it is hard and so is rejection (if it comes your way) it is most likely that they like you (if the reason you like them is their personality) because you will have things in common.<br>      * Even if you are rejected, forget about it. Your friends will be there for you.<br>      * Remember: if you are not ready to tell him then don't. The time will come.<br>      * If you want to tell him but are too worried, then see if he will tell you first. If he doesn't give a truthful answer or you think he is covering it up and you still want to tell him, you will have to do it yourself.<br>      * Be careful not to come off too strongly because it might send him the wrong message.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Warnings<br>  <br>      * Make sure you're ready to handle rejection if it comes your way.<br>      * If his ex-girlfriend is your friend; stop and talk to her to make sure it's okay. You don't want to risk losing a friend.<br>      * If he says yes and you become boyfriend/girlfriend, DON'T become obsessive. Your girlfriends will get sick of you talking about the boy all the time.|`|tWNyYOnuaa	flirt a little with him try 2 spend more time with him ...<br>  <br>    Good Luck <br>  <br>                  ?

Aiden needs to grow up.|`|dd9d372ea7ab00caa1bbdaaa8bb9dc19aa	I’m speaking on behalf of my mother who lost my dad 13 years ago.  To this day, she always says that she wishes he was still here.  Even when she was dating another man, she would think about the problems she had…either with the house or with my brothers…and the first person she would think about was my dad.  She also only has one photo up in the home which is their wedding photo.  She isn’t with the man anymore because he was a total jerk but that’s besides the point.<br>  <br>  A widow never gets over the death of her husband, especially if that person was taken away before they were ready to let each other go.  But that doesn’t meant that she can’t be happy with someone else.  One of my boss’s also lost her husband years ago and even though she speaks fondly of him, she is remarried and is very much in love and grateful to have him in her life.  He needs to accept the fact that there is this love that she will have for her deceased husband that she will never feel for him…but she will (and it sounds like she has) develop new loving feelings for him that will last a lifetime…as long as he stops being insecure.|`|AA11791082	He sounds like a big insecure mama's boy BABY.

Sometimes when a person dies, God brings someone else along to give them companionship and it has nothing to do with the previous relationship. Your relationship is unique because it's you and this person. Sadly, if he continues to think this way, she might give up on him ever really completely loving her and find someone else.|`|wmOgseCgaa	I think your friend should be happy Allie loves him and keep it at that. His insecurities will ruin the relationship, of course she loved her husband but life goes on. She is moving on, she is happy and in love. <br>  Why can't he just leave it at that? He should leave it alone or he will drive himself crazy. He can't compete with a dead guy.|`|hofFMjzwaa	He is being completely illogical!! George is GONE. He is no competition, no threat, and he won't be back. She kept her vows and was with her husband until they were parted by Death. Sure she will always have a place in her Heart for him, but that doesn't mean she does not have room in her heart to Love another. Tell Aiden to stop being a Fool, and Go get this Woman that he Loves!!! Good Luck !!!|`|wA8g5mFNaa	People change, and she isn't the same person she was when she married George. My mother was widowed and years later I just had to ask if she would want him back, and she said no at least not for herself. She had changed so much that it wouldn't be the same. So tell Aiden that she will probably always love George, but that doesn't take away from her feelings for him.

Look at your parents, look at Heidi Klum and Seal. <br>  <br>  Do your best to see the good things about your mixed ethnicity. The grass isn't always greener on the other side.

juRWvc0eaa	I can relate being a single father. I happen to live on the same street as my family, and thus use them as sitters often as well. I have found that sometimes you might have to bite the bullet and PAY someone you know as a sitter. If you have the cash to go out, you should have enough for a sitter as well,even if your guy is paying for everything else.<br>  Mom will not like that. She will wonder WHY you didn't go to her, and that should open up the chance at talking to her to SHOW her you are serious about moving on with your life.

DON'T STAND FOR  IT. You can take control of your life without being disrespectful to your mother....and if your happy and set goals and date and move on you and your child will be happier....|`|AvhTCS4Aaa	I'll be yur baby daddy.|`|guLZMT7naa	Well I think that its your life to choose to date, I mean I think that you should only date men that are going to be good to you and your kids. Now as for your mom she is not helping your situation, I mean you could actually find another man who will take care of you and love you. Then you wouldn't have to live with them anymore. I think that she just wants you around and it may be hard on her to think about you leaving. I would just make a date and then just let your mom deal. She may actually like the guy. Just remember your not a little girl anymore.|`|yEgnVvhaaa	Hi there I`m 45 I was divorced and had to move home for awhile with my kids it so hard. I think it comes down to if you were hurt in the last relationship your parents do not want to see you hurt again . my parent though the same thing at me. I finely had to get them out of the house to do something . so  when something came up for me I could go out . I always had to set thing up a week ahead to let them no I was going out try that. you will soon have to find your own place. to get your life back. I`ve been there you need help e-mail me I try to help you out with my experience.

PtRKFnpNaa	-  Meu amigo,<br>  Existe sentido e raz?o nessa sua observa??o...<br>  Eu só quero acrescentar que homens jovens com cabelos bonitos, limpos e bem tratados, dependendo também do formato do rosto e do tipo ficam muito bem... mas, quando o homem atinge a meia idade para a maturidade, por mais bonitos que sejam os cabelos, e mesmo se ainda restar neles uma generosa cabeleira, eles devem manter os cabelos curtos...<br>  Assim como as mulheres de modo geral, só devem manter os cabelos longos se eles forem bonitos, limpos e bem tratados, dependendo também do tipo de rosto e do estilo que ela se veste e do tipo físico.  Além disso, também as mulheres quando chegam a meia idade ou a maturidade, mesmo tendo cabelos lindos e bem tratados, elas devem manter os cabelos curtos pois na idade madura, cabelos longos para essas mulheres d?o uma aparencia de mais velhas ao contrário de certas mulheres pensarem que os cabelos longos rejuvenecem, salvo se eles s?o meio longos e usam eles sempre elegantemente presos... Além do mais,<br>  a vaidade feminina as obrigam a tinturarem os cabelos em fun??o dos cabelos brancos e também em fun??o disso, é muito melhor mante-los sempre curtos... cabelos longos, constantemente tinturados, eles enfraquecem naturalmente e mante-los sempre bonitos requer muito trato e disponibilidade economica e de tempo...|`|767dcb7f3af4ae203bdd38a1b7a9b4e0aa	o cabelo é a moldura do nosso rosto,ent?o o nosso corte de cabelo tem que combinar com nosso tipo,sen?o fica meio esquisito...<br>  beijos.....|`|Cb2vtXXlaa	Concordo!

nJrw4LRKaa	A lot of little kids (boys and girls) touch themselves when they are little because they're curious.  Some girls do it because it feels good and is relaxing and it helps them go to sleep.  You're still completely innocent.  It's really okay.  Don't ever let anyone make fun of you for wanting to save everything until marriage.  You have that right and in today's world, not many people choose that option anymore.  There's nothing wrong with you and you are still a virgin and it is perfectly okay to tell your partner that you are if that is all you've done.  Don't feel disgusted with yourself.  You were curious.  There are different thoughts on masturbation in the Christian community.  Some Christians believe it is wrong because you should be enjoying this kind of touching with your partner, but others believe it is okay and healthy for you to be familiar with everything.  In your case, you were young and didn't have any idea what you were doing so you are okay, but it is up to you to decide which school of thought you agree with.  If you do decide to keep touching, don't feel guilty.  You don't have anything to feel guilty about.  I really applaud your decision to wait.  A lot of people regret the first time they have sex (I know I do) and it creates a lot of problems in a relationship later when you've had many partners.  Your beliefs may not always be popular, but they are your own and what's popular may not always be right.  You're all right and you're normal.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Masturbation is a completely normal part of human experience. In fact, it has been documented that humans as young as 6 months old engage in masturbation. You have not done ANYTHING wrong at all and should not be feeling guilty about something that is completely normal. I encourage you to visit Scarleteen's masturbation section and read the articles there which talk about the subject in-depth (link below).<br>  <br>  Oh, and you are definitely still a virgin. Virginity is widely considered to be taken the first time you engage in sexual intercourse (vaginal penetration).|`|R3HjDrRJaa	nope, alot of girls who masturbate are still virgins, and for the record if neither of you dont knwo whats gonna happen your in for alot of trouble, its good to do that to yourself so you can tell your partner what you specifically like and youll be happier, btw you shouldnt feel disgusted alot of people do it|`|TrMhgzQ3aa	You're more normal than most people. Or, more mature rather. You're still a virgin. Touching yourself is harmless and everyone does it at some point.|`|d0ACYlpzaa	I understand what your feeling I felt like that when i was younger. But its actually a good thing for you to do that to figure out your body so when you do find that special someone you can help him help you if that makes sense. Its not wrong cause its your own body so dont feel disgusted!|`|aktoTGliaa	Relax sweetheart, there is nothing wrong with you. Everyone does it, you are still a virgin, and I am happy that you want to stay virgin until marriage. Good for you, your husband will be very lucky.|`|tmfhieP7aa	You're a virgin.<br>  Plain and simple.|`|LaIoPxKTaa	sweetie your still a virgin.|`|5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	Millions of people masturbate... It's not even close to actual sex which is when you lose your virginity.|`|026cd30827458a521baf2af7f7f2ef6faa	Sweetie, you are placing so much pressure on yourself about this. First of all , you ARE a virgin(based on your story). Actual intercourse and penetration defines "virginity", and no other sexual activity does.<br>  Obviously, you are sexual despite "saving" yourself for marriage. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. There are many ways to express that side of yourself, either alone or with your partner, without having intercourse to disrupting your virginity. <br>  It's natural. <br>  Don't tell your future partner about the subject of this question, however, because you will come across in a negative light for not knowing and being worried about it.<br>  Good Luck to you
abPx0ItGaa	Just hang out with her when she gets back and she'll figure it out =)|`|Z7ll98psaa	Just tell her!!|`|T3VOvvy5aa	if you broke up only because of that she was moving, just tell her you still have feelings for her.|`|j2LFg5deaa	That's so sweet!<br>  First, I would ask her to go out, something romantic, but not too romantic, something like a walk and picnic through the park, and then, sit her down at the blanket, you have two ways to do this, give her a flower that says I still love you, and always will. or put it on her sandwich. Then tell her the rest. Tell her how you feel about everything, when she was gone, and the feelings come crashing down when you saw her, etc. I know I would want a guy to do that for me!  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|Z2NLFBOFaa	awh, how sweet. simply tell her. go for it, cupid!<br>  <br>  :)!  x|`|aaDDtbTnaa	Aww that is so cute and sweet! I say, you should meet her tell her eye to eye while holding her hand confessing everything. If that is a little too scary, sneak a flower in her purse with a little note saying it all or a text message, still romantic and not that scary! But do something before she ends up with another guy. obviously she still has feelings for you, when she calls you and informs you she is coming and actually saved your phone number is pretty sweet. I hope you guys hit it off again! I'm a sucker for an happy ending:)|`|aNwQ14hdaa	well obviously she still has feelings for you too if she bothered to save your number and call to inform you that she really was coming back.you really have nothing to lose,so i'd say it in a really romantic,sweet way.im sure everything will go the way you want it too:)good luck.|`|eFUzMcdMaa	Some people think it is as easy as a snap but i know wat your going through just take it slow and let her get to kno you again and if she was in love with you the first time shell kno if she is still in love|`|agNTWkr2aa	Go to lunch to catch up, make sure you are near a park/beach where you can go for a walk after.  On the walk, just make a move for her hand at some point if things are going well and you are gold.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tdicLW7naa	are you serious?this is no stranger to you..yu have confidence with this girl.let her know and if she came back to you,where do you think her head is at?|`|8jMryGQ9aa	justt tell her evenn after the break up and her moving you could stop thinking about her then drop the i still love you somewhere along those lines.|`|l5EjTMuMaa	you could ease it on, by using things like " You know you're the only girl for me..." and then say it, or you could just go on and tell her!|`|0BndsgsSaa	just tell her|`|hVCyUg3Xaa	play 20 questions and slip it in there|`|6CrvMGSraa	tell the truth. if your truthfull and reall and loving, she will be able to tell. Telll her EXCATLY WHAT YOU FEEL and whether she comes back or not you know you did the best you could and that is all you can do.

fqRlA9ROaa	lol! I don't think there's any true study of how you'll look when you get older! It's all just genetics, and puberty! My boyfriend jokes all the time about how cute and pretty I was when I was little, how I went through a super awkward "ugly duckling"stage through middle school, and the "blossomed" into a beautiful woman when I got older. I really think it's just genetics and there's no reason to stress because there's not much you can do about it! As long as you're happy with who you are.. then you don't need to worry do you? Whether you think you're beautiful or not.. remember that someone else always will think you're the most beautiful thing in the world. If you're not happy with youself, then think of why, and find ways to make your confidence stronger!|`|ea05859f8f81d87f783ba41e29be0a94aa	Ya, i have heard it too, but it aint perfect for everyone, some people say forever beautiful, some dont.<br>  <br>  Actually if u take proper care of ur skin, then nothing will happen!<br>  <br>  Stop worrying, life is beautiful, enjoy it!|`|NCNcC7Tjaa	shmmmm, wrinkles talks better|`|xmnudUDSaa	what the hell???|`|0VOSubezaa	I dont think thats true..

A ZIP file contains one or more files that have been compressed, to reduce their file size, or stored as-is. A number of compression algorithms are permitted in zip files but as of 2008 only DEFLATE is widely used and supported.<br>  <br>  The format was originally evolved by Phil Katz for PKZIP from the previous ARC compression format by Thom Henderson. However, many software utilities other than PKZIP itself are now available to create, modify, or open (unzip, decompress) ZIP files, notably WinZip, BOMArchiveHelper, KGB Archiver, PicoZip, Info-ZIP, WinRAR, IZArc, 7-Zip, ALZip, TUGZip, PeaZip, Universal Extractor and Zip Genius. Microsoft has included built-in ZIP support (under the name "compressed folders") in later versions of its Windows operating system. Apple has included built-in ZIP support in Mac OS X 10.3 and later via the BOMArchiveHelper utility.<br>  <br>  ZIP files generally use the file extensions ".zip" or ".ZIP" and the MIME media type application/zip. Some software uses the ZIP file format as a wrapper for a large number of small items in a specific structure. Generally when this is done a different file extension is used. Examples of this usage are Java JAR files, id Software .pk3/.pk4 files, package files for StepMania and Winamp/Windows Media Player skins, XPInstall, as well as OpenDocument and Office Open XML office formats. Both OpenDocument and Office Open XML formats use the JAR file format internally, so files can be easily uncompressed and compressed using tools for ZIP files. Google Earth makes use of KMZ files, which are just KML files in ZIP format. Mozilla Firefox Add-ons are zip files with extension "xpi". Nokia's mobile phone themes are zipped with extension "nth".

jGdOtj40aa	The reason they lose interest is because they got what they wanted and now it's old news.  It's always more fun to chase something that "you can't have."  <br>  <br>  Most men also don't have the emotional connection to sex as women do; at least not until they are older and have matured a bit more.  <br>  <br>  Why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free?|`|MOALoKWdaa	i have no clue but lucky my guy didnt feel wierd after wards n so didnt i......|`|48d3853d53994e55145c20465c94e555aa	Most guys will not like a girl for a long time but there are those that will be patient enough to play the waiting game.  There is not much you can do to keep our interest if it's not what we are pursuing.  And no it is not better if you just hold out for months and months at a time.  If that's what the guy is after and it does not happen soon then he will move on to someone that does not want to wait forever.  You have to be good enough to know what it is you're looking for and then build those relationships accordingly.  Just make sure the guys you are talking to are aware of your intentions cause you can create quite a mess by misrepresenting your intentions.|`|4DeBTJRxaa	First of all, the guy and girl were absolutely NEVER friends, though that is what the girl always thinks.  Unless the man is gay or the girl is butt-ugly, she has no true male friends.  None.  The truth is- he wanted to have sex with her from the very start.  The months of “friendship” was really him strategically waiting for his chance to get in her pants.  Women believe that the longer they wait to have sex, the more romantic it will be, and the less of a ho she will be in her friends’ eyes.  But by prolonging the wait for sex, you actually make yourself more of a whore because in fact you are holding out to get the maximum attention, gifts, dates, etc.- all of which equates to money.  In essence, trying to exchange as little sex as possible for the maximum money possible.  There comes an inevitable point where you will either have to put out or get dumped.  By this time, the sex is so built up that he is expecting you to totally rock his world.  When this doesn’t happen, and you lie there like a nun’s corpse, thinking it’s all meaningful and whatnot, he is left thinking- “That was it?” and loses interest.  There you have it.|`|9c7axUXcaa	Well, i'm not like this lol but guys are in it for the sex. They don't love you, womoen define love as a feeling that you and him can be together forever and age until your ear hair falls out. Sorry but men define it as finding a hot girls and rooting her. Because after the first sex there is no build up to anything that you're waiting for.<br>  There is no more desire after sex for men, unless you are a porn star and have heaps good moves most men will probably leave the relationship there.<br>  Sorry.|`|oKhTYkSgaa	It doesn't always happen this way, it sounds like you just found an a**hole. Not all guys do this.|`|dEJ0ZyaAaa	beacuase all guys only want one thing when they like you i mean of corse they wanna kiss you and stuff but they are also wanna ya no but they wanna do that more becuse they wanna see what it's like then like after wards then they don't like you so much cause they found someone else|`|tGGeaHK1aa	Hard to say..... depends on the girl. Some keep my interest up for years some for weeks. I cannot describe why......... I reckon same like everyone....|`|y3O37lzeaa	Not all guys are like this, but the only way you can prevent this from happening is to not have sex with them right away or even close to right away. Any guy who is after you and not just the sex will continue to stay and you can actually keep some of your slef respect and dignity. I know this from experience. I would say wait at least 2-3 months before having sex, if not longer, but whatever is right for you.
juRWvc0eaa	Wear what you want... What you wear is not anywhere near as important as having a good time. Good luck.
j2LGxtHtaa	It is true that some girls are very adept at reading body language, but not true that all girls are turned on by "cocky" guys.  Confidence is definitely a turn on, because nobody wants to be constantly reassuring their partner of their worth.  I think in order to APPEAR confident you actually have to BE confident.  Just keep reminding yourself of all your wonderful qualities, take good care of yourself, and try not to worry too much about your minor flaws.  Your belief in yourself will shine through in your carriage and overall demeanor.|`|edycn5ggaa	Well since more than half the people on this section of questions are girls I doubt that ALL girls can do this.

So, just turn your mind to how confident you feel and that will show. Look around you, see who you think comes across to you as confident looking and try to step in their shoes, if that helps.<br>  Confident does not mean "overconfident" but just at ease.|`|rDnwu00saa	Uh,there has got to be a certain amount of cockyness, you can't just be up there saying "i'm to sexy for my..." ok that's alittle to over confident, which may or may not seem corny, but in my book that's a zero. Now on the other hand I like a guy that can approach me first, I find it hot, so if you have the confidence to do that, then your just fine, most importantly be respectful.|`|AA10567336	It really depends on the girl.  <br>  <br>  As far as holding yourself this way little things can make a difference.

But when I say confident I don't mean showing off like a twat. It's good to be quietly confident, making the first moves, actively flirting, teasing you about how he's amazing etc.<br>  You should try and emphasise the points that you're proud of. For example, my boyfriend is a snowboard instructor and he's always like 'well I am a snowboard instructor..' implying that he's just simply cool because of that. He's an awesome chef. He talks about how he 'made a banging meal last night'.. and goes on to brag and describe it to me.<br>  Don't seem too interested in a girl, but not so uninterested that you seem nervous. 'Play it cool.' Don't always be the first one to text etc.<br>  Main point is to only be cocky if you have something to be cocky about. Don't lie and don't exaggerate. Just be cocky about what's true and what you can afford to be cocky about.|`|QjvqLpaoaa	well, you can start by simply standing up straighter and your shoulders back....with good posture you can look more confident and seem like you're in charge, girls like that in guys....and try not to ever cross arms in front of you, no matter how you might have meant it or not meant it, it always comes off as how you're not interested and bored.|`|nhr64utMaa	no i hate cocky guys.<br>  and pretty much guys who have WAY too much confidence and think every girl wants them.<br>  but it is nice to see guys that feel comfortable around girls...<br>  bc if theyre toooooo shy thats a turn-off<br>  but i am shy too so i give em a break sometimes.<br>  you just cant be tooo over-confident but still be calm.<br>  i love shy guys though, if they arent too shy<br>  :]|`|U8lG8Ltjaa	comfortable- yes!<br>  cocky/conceited/vain- no.....who would want to spent a night with someone who thinks of himself as a god? but thinking that ur horrible looking isnt good either.<br>  <br>  how to NOT get cocky- think to urself "i have this great girl, so i must be pretty handsome, but there are tons of people out there who may be more good-looking than me"|`|DebcHwWuaa	I liek when i guy is confident...not cocky there is a difference cocky guys just expect everything and think they are the sh*t and xpect u to think the same.<br>  <br>  I have found that cocky guys normally cheat ont heir gf's too and tht their relationships don't last too long...|`|yEv1bPdNaa	i personally like when i guys confident.<br>  but NOT cocky.<br>  <br>  when a guys too into himself its a big turn off<br>  <br>  yeah guys  are sometimes pretty easy to "read"ahah :p|`|lVhrGfInaa	Confidence is a turn on,  who wants to be hanging out with a hopeless guy/girl.

0d3giSjEaa	Without more info it is hard to guess, but here goes....<br>  <br>  It probably has to do with the "crowd" you hang around with, whether it is the type guys you are around or if you have what could be trashy women around all the time.  My first thought is you need to go out and find new people to be friends with, male or female.  Remember that you know who and what you are, don't let others make you feel any different. Be strong and believe in yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Does your "rommie" have that reputation, if so then it is guilt by association, even though that is wrong.|`|UVciAbXxaa	look some guys just talk shyt cause they want to i knoe guys that call girls hoe's for no reason there just a**holes just be who u are an pain no mind to wat other ppl say bout u|`|AA11591992	Well you ruled out many things but maybe this, are you the touchy feely type?  Meaning do you touch the guys when you talk to them?  As we guys go, that often sends the wrong message.  Other than that, if you are a flirt that may also send the wrong message.|`|b21be047f04affe2a5a6f7fcdfd7bb82aa	I'm not a guy but I have had experiencewith type of problem. 99% of the time people say stuff like that about people, it's because they are jealous of all that you have accomplished.<br>  You know what kind of person you are, and you know that you don't deserve to be treated like that. Most likely, another woman started all of this.|`|xSbOQdiGaa	they might like like you or something like that. if your in high school then most the boys are like that when you get in college they will be nice to you.just be who you are a respectable person the you are a respectable person !|`|ea05859f8f81d87f783ba41e29be0a94aa	Look around u carefully, someone u know is spreading bad news about u! cud be a guy or a girl.<br>  <br>  someone who is jealous, or something<br>  <br>  maybe a girl u hang out with a lot is a ho!|`|AA12317110	Could just be the age group I have a younger sister so I know the element Im 26 my sis is 18 even at that age the average guy is an asshole....|`|16Eu5GNKaa	Maybe you is a ho.|`|GdPf8Uhqaa	It's because you are, in fact, a ho|`|RaNhjs0haa	i think guys do that b/c they want girls to be hoes they wanna get what they want from them and thats all..|`|ys6zP3Qeaa	change the type of guys you hang with
TQACC9G2aa	Where I come from it was hard to find white guys that liked black girls. Then I got with my now husband whom is white and all of a sudden the white guys that like black girls started to show themselves. <br>  <br>  The main problem is that the single white guys don't know that you are into guys of their color. So they show themselves AFTER its too late because now they know what you like.<br>  <br>  So I say ask around ask your friends see what they know. Odds are they are right in front of you!!|`|5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	Race doesn't matter since almost all men think alike when around girls. (No, I'm not being perverted)|`|DfaiuJo7aa	cool|`|CrTtGrHvaa	If you want to date outside your race, you most def. need to surround yourself with those individuals. If your are going to school, start talking to guys that are white, Mexican, Asian. Remember it all starts off as a friendship. You do not need to throw yourself at them, all you need to do is start a simple conversation...a quick smile! Just try being more social towards the type of guys u want to date.|`|lELMPtG5aa	You don't have to do anything. There are actually a lof of guys who are not African-American that were practically born being attracted to African-American women, like my guy. He's attracted to nothing but African-American women. I guess it depends on where you live. I am from a town where there's hardly any African-Americans, so whenever one of these guys comes through or moves here, they take notice because there are hardly any African-American females here (that's not how I met my man though). <br>  <br>  I do not blame you for not being one to be approaching men. Do you have any guy friends who aren't African-American that you could somewhat see yourself with? If so, it would not hurt to hit off a convo. asking "Would you ever date outside your race??" and go from there. Otherwise, believe me, they are out there, you'll find some sooner-or-later.

c0IAWW07aa	what's amazing about guys is that they can differentiate "casual sex" from "making love" very well. they can set their minds that way.<br>  <br>  if you tell that to him knowing that he only wants you for sex, he'll probably just:<br>       1.) play with your feelings<br>       2.) stay away from you until he sees that u don't like him anymore<br>       3.) boast with it to all of his friends which you're not related to<br>       4.) all of the above<br>  <br>  and a guy tend to be so sweet on a girl even if he only wants her for sex.<br>  <br>  i'm sorry but that's the truth. <br>  <br>  stay away from him for a while until you're feelings for him disappear...|`|YZyWmiIAaa	just wait to see if he acts different towards you.
10HcSggMaa	Yeah, well if you said you've only met him once and he probably doesn't remember you, you probably shouldn't call him.. he might take it as creepy. Just wait till you see him again and you guys can flirt and you can give him your number. :)
f5agxtSHaa	if you call and he says he's busy<br>  if he restricts you from doing things but then does them himself<br>  if he gets angry when you question him about it<br>  if he hides things from you and then gets angry and turns things around as if you did something wrong...<br>  <br>  theres so many warning signs but when your in the relationship its sometimes hard to see them because you dont want to believe that its actually happening. if you think your boyfriend is cheating on you then there must be some things that he's doing to make you think this. i think the best way to handle it is to make it clear that if he is doing anything like that then you will definately break it off. talk to him about it. but also keep in mind that he may not be cheating, it might be something else.<br>  <br>  good luck i hope so much that he isnt cheating on you. i was cheated on by the first boy i ever loved and slept with and god i know how much it hurts so make sure he knows it isnt on. <br>  <br>  if you do find out that he has cheated feel free to email me id be happy to talk to you about it.|`|pKsOqssxaa	Straight from the movie "Baby Boy".<br>  <br>  "Let me smell your dick"!!!! lol|`|AA11441704	Feeling........|`|POZvhqj4aa	excuses, excuses you can find out by the phone calls or text msg.|`|8j5LRUwNaa	1.

OPhr0Zw0aa	i don't understand your question.  <br>  <br>  you can marry people from other countries no matter what your gender is.
5YxNGfd4aa	You have to be honest with him hunni. I have my daughter in the same position at the moment that she's able to go and live with her father when ever she likes so if she came to me and said i want to go to dads i'd be heartbroken to lose her of course but would have let her go. But i would want her honesty to start with. That way theres no secrets or lies about any other reason behind the move. <br>  <br>  Its her decision after all and if it makes her happier being there then that's all a parent could ask for. It doesn't mean he's going to love you any less. <br>  Goodluck.|`|wmOgseCgaa	Have you checked out the school near your mother?<br>  I have to tell you that the grass is not always greener on the other side, I've tried it. Maybe you should sit down with your dad and tell him about the school thing and together you can look at options.<br>  Finish out the school year where you are then take a couple months in the summer to spend at your moms, if she is as great as you remember then move in. <br>  It really sucks when you give up what you feel are horrible conditions only to realize you had it great and you won't be able to get it back.|`|vVVYNVEgaa	well firstly you need to assess what life will be like living with your mother. i mean just because of art is a good reason yes but, why dont ou live wither her in the first place. If you decide to really move then you need to tell him your reasons. its your life not his. if your mom is willing to have you then he cant do anyting anyway|`|VUoVmYZ0aa	I agree with the top three, you should first do your reasearch then approach your dad, then tell him gently, he might be hurt and heartbroken, but he loves you and will look out for your best interests, if you feel your mother is willing and capable of being there for you as a support system and not just as a spring board for your arts program then by all means do it, but approach with caution.<br>  Also, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if the court put you there with your father you should also check to make sure that the court will allow your mother to have custody of you.

We all need someone with whom we can share our lives, thoughts, feelings, and frustrations.<br>  <br>  and the most importan is the thing called "LOVE".....Genuine friendship supports during times of struggle.

lxW7I39caa	you cant get hiom back it wouldnt be right for you to take him away from his new girlfriend,because after all you broke his heart the first time, you should move on and find some one else ex; if my girlfriend ever dumped me and i found some one new n she wanted me back id say tuff luck you broke my heart first, after al how would you feel if someone took you him from you when you started going out with him|`|757c91a5e3a9215007b5dd0c6436e097aa	Are you sure you didn't 'sense' that he finally moved on and that could be your reason you want him back all the sudden? Because in some people cases when they know someone is unavailable, they will want them more. <br>  <br>  Your ex found happiness again after realizing the one he thought he love didn't feel the same way. I think it will be unfair to try to setup a plan to break those two up-- you should have thought prior the breakup if he is the one you really wanted or if you found it to be unimaginable to not have him in your life anymore. You either like him or you don't, no one enjoy being around somebody that turns their feelings on and off like a button.<br>  <br>  Take this one as a very hard lesson to learn. Don't let the next good guy that enter your life be another one that got away.|`|uOZC8S5kaa	the only way you could probably win him back is to<br>  slowly make him develope feelings for you again<br>  <br>  most guys will always have feelings for their ex hiddin somewhere in them|`|y18cBpjoaa	ohhhhhhh well.

If he doesn't want to talk right then, ask him when a good time would be, or tell him you'll call back in a day or two (but that he can call you if he wants).  If he's still not ready in a day or two, ask him whether he needs more time or if it's just over.|`|91db6a4d486dece36cdd77acfc4a9ef9aa	If you love him, make up with him.|`|AA10975398	Call him now..what is stopping you..?<br>  6 years....is a long time---long enough to be over pride, and have some maturity in your relationship..you would think..<br>  If you want to stay with him, make it known..why torture yourself, this is your boyfriend, Go after what you want, if you were wrong apologize, But, at least call him to talk..<br>  You are torturing yourself for nothing!!|`|JS3LDNeJaa	Call him soon B4 he moves on.|`|7jTJYeREaa	see, the problem with fights between guys and girls is we always blame the other. we dont care who really started it or who said something stupid, it's always "it's ur fault, not mine". the best way would be to compromise. admit that u did something wrong too, like "i shouldnt have did this and that".<br>  <br>  everyone protects their pride. but if noone budges, u end up losing something and worse, u chose it to happen.|`|EaXCpTrlaa	Call him and just ask him. Honestly. Be straight up. Don't play no waiting kiddy games. If he doesn't take your calls then that shows you how childish he is. Go to his house and tell him its over.|`|KarTY6u4aa	I would go see him in person.  On the phone he can still hang up or not answer but in person your harder to turn down or away.  Sooner than later would be the answer.  Otherwise all those little things will keep nagging away at you the more silence goes on. Also, if you've been with them for such a long time, go back again and at least talk to see where you stand.  Sometimes people had a bad day say things but they didn't really mean it just something trigured it.  Or they said it to say it to put it on the books but they still really care

Also, saying that you will never do it again and getting her nice would help.|`|7f67356955414fca3c91ccf17f1d54eaaa	lol just like the third answer i co-sign all answers!|`|9227f445dd747c16fdb3934ea62382dfaa	Be willing to do what ever it takes to show her that you are truly sorry and it will never happen again. If you are not willing to do this, then keep going and wait your turn because it will happen to you or you will live the res rest of your life wondering if it is.<br>  Your girlfriend may decide to take you back,but then she may decide to do the same thing to you and think how you would feel then.<br>  See "Now Tha's Love"<br>  My ex thought that I would always be there for him, but the patience ran out and I could never ever fathom being with him in any way-not even being friends with such a terrible liar.<br>  There r are trust issues and you need to evaluate why you risked losing her in  the first place. Sometimes it si just best to say that you were being stupid instead of making excuses. Some try to cast blame on the girlfriend or the other person, but it is the person who is at fault. There is always a moment where you can say no!<br>  So if you are willing to do wht ever it takes, ask her what takes and then go from there-good luck!|`|FnnyT1mlaa	I co-sign with the first answer.|`|NbIriIkDaa	All you haft to do is take her out dinner maybe dancing girls are easy to get back trust me i have had 40 g/F's all of them have came back soner or later|`|vWXhHW07aa	work at it but you broke her heart by cheating on her which what it means to her is that you would have rather been with someone else and that she wasn't good enough for you.|`|AA11352871	You screwed up, you deserve it!|`|JZrAH8FUaa	Yea i dont think u can get her back that easy <br>  it took me bout a year to get back with mine <br>  she hates u at first but than u become friends <br>  and from friends u become more than friends but <br>  trust me if you two break up it wont happen twice|`|brv82Ri7aa	you don't deserve her back.<br>  you made the decision to be a immature guy and cheat on her deal with the consequences|`|ekk2sQVlaa	you honestly think you deserve to get her back???|`|sFcZ77ykaa	you have to gain her trust slowly.. you have to be patient thou cuz she might gona drive you crazy... well it's your fault.. but hey.. everybody have done some mistakes.

But talking about sports generally bores me and I can't stand arrogant jock-type men.
AA11199102	ask him, it's the only way to tell. it could have been an emotional moment, but we don't know that. you have a better chance of knowing than any stranger on the internet would, but i don't see any reason why he doesn't.|`|5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	He meant it.|`|Be0CtbMzaa	it doesn't count if your having sex...he only wants your body.<br>  <br>  You will learn that men who love you will tell you at the time you least expect it.<br>  <br>  Find a real guy, who appreciates you for what you really are!!.|`|Gj02KnNNaa	rookie mistake. often guys who aren't really experienced think that highly intimate times is the best time to say it, but it's actually the opposite that works best. don't worry, like i said, rookie mistake.|`|VbMJYMfaaa	Gurl....I love Ice cream ...and I love sex.<br>  Sometimes I say I love you to people that please me in a way. <br>  But for now hopefully he'll tell you I love you all the time not only when you are having sex. <br>  Saying i love you to someone is easy , demostrating it makes the difference.|`|zFx7NT2Baa	A guy can feel some extra-intense emotion when being intimate (as you tell) just as you will as the emotions and chemistry get hotter, so the basic feeling of loving you might get expressed at that moment before he retreats into his usual, guy sort of, self.  It would be that way for me when I was younger; now - however - at that moment during sex I am a little more cautious about saying, "I love you," but I am more likely to say it when not having sex, as I do now almost every day to my wife.|`|4SEL5RL7aa	Save yourself a lot of worrying and possible future fights and just ask him.  He might have said it just to be romantic, and he might have said it because he really does and he just does not express emotions very well and needed an "emotional" time for it to come out.  Find a comfortable time and just ask him.  I hope it all works out.|`|RVR9iGVMaa	It could be an honest gesture from him but id be careful not to believe everything when having sex... <br>  If he says it to u another time (when ur not having sex) then id take it that it was an honest I LOVE YOU rather than him saying it while having sex and not being able to say I LOVE U any other time except only when hez in bed with u.

He's a year younger than me - adorable - huge athlete....and I'm not athletic and I'm loud - and he's shy.  AND WE DON'T TALK.

But - good question.|`|0mZNVVryaa	just start with some nice, witty conversation... just let it flow..|`|Vf6vbRhJaa	start with casual talk....Just like "hi, i noticed u in class, ur kinda ghetto. are u into hiphop?" or "hi there, wat do u think of our spanish class? really? cool". when u guys start talkin then its time for you to step ur game up, if he doesnt step up himself.. ask him "hey, u wanna get some food or something?".. in the end u guys will talk about more serious things, and be more open to each other... then u wont have to rape him,, hahaha|`|jExD9NUcaa	First, I totally think that like you use like to much!!! You want to rape him.....ok !! You need to get some help like now!!|`|0rVNJ6ubaa	Be outgoing and ask him a question..even if u already know the answer= )|`|8LksLo8taa	just talk to him, you will always wish you had if you don't.|`|9kVXV6Ppaa	i would go sit next to him and complement him or say something that u guys both argree on|`|ASKJAkTJaa	well at your spanish class sit really close to him, and act like if you were confuse and ask him for help....or when you get out of the class try to wait for him and just say did you get the part that blah blah blah  ....... youll start a conversation|`|JLzRTKj7aa	just say hi to him everyday and youll get him.

And, if you notice something he has (like a picture or something), ask him about it and spark up a conversation.  You'll be nervous, but once it is over it wikll be so worth it! :)|`|RjdU0rzCaa	just talk about anything ask him to help you with your work if yall ever have to pair up in class try to get to him first and being shy is not going to get you any were you will alway wonder what if! take it from me i ben there|`|VC0W96Weaa	Introduce yourself and just pretend its like kindergarten and you just meet them but you feel like you've been friends with him for a long time and start a conversation.|`|bGSJfyPmaa	The easiest way to have an excuse to talk to him would be to bring up something about the class/homework, or perhaps you could point out that you like something he's wearing, and if he's interested, the response would show it. Either way, if you want to rape him then I don't know if you two should be talking at all ;-)|`|hWC6miCbaa	Well mabe you can start by asking a real simple question like can i borrow a pencil, paper, etc or something equally corny. Otherwise you can like just go upto his desk and just introduce yourself. I mean i swear hes probably shy because he dosen't know anyone, if you go ad begin a conversation, then it might lesad to something. After introducing yourself kind of joke with him and make him laugh, thats a start. After a little while f being "friends" then go ahead and wink at him or smile at himw when he passes your desk or somehting. it would be kind of cute you know. sorry about the spelling mistakes.|`|qyU1BoKaaa	Maybe start with "hello" and see where it goes from there.|`|scIs4jWnaa	get paired with him for a project in spanish and let it go from there, or talk about a band you both might like|`|sxpbfmiKaa	Lol, it's funny reading that.

I'm sure you'll work something out.|`|tsoehpc0aa	hi <br>  <br>  well, you got the best chance .. you two are in the same class , ask him to trade phone numbers in case if you mis a class or so.<br>  the next time . ask him you can meet him after class because you need help to understand some spanish grammer. and move on .. you have to creat things like that ....<br>  <br>  <br>  always your best answer

U3WW7PE6aa	I'm a dude, but I would say the most attractive thing to a guy is being yourself. Wearing make-up helps as well because it shows that you care about yourself. Showing confidence is key and presentation is as well.|`|Cd5avmhWaa	flirt|`|mxYvGO2Saa	Confidence is sexy in just about anyone. If you're yourself and he still doesn't like you then you just aren't his type.<br>  <br>  Never, ever **** it up to get a guy to like you. I'm a guy, and I love The Sex, but if a girl just gave it up and didn't show me she was a decent person, I'd probably still sleep with her, but never call again.<br>  <br>  Does that make me kind of an ***? No, because as far as I'm concerned, the only thing that kind of girl wanted me for was sex, so I obliged and moved on to a girl that turned out to have some substance.<br>  <br>  Oh, and never hide who you are. If you're kind of a nerdy chick on the inside that likes video games, be honest and tell him if it comes up. If you'd rather hit the gym and run a dozen miles on the treadmill, ask him to join.<br>  <br>  Being yourself = The Awesome.<br>  <br>  Again, if he doesn't like you for you, then he never will. Never change to get someone to live you.

Sing for him, maybe just a line or two of a song every once in a while, and see how he responds.  Just be ready to handle any kind of response, and know that even if he doesn't like the singing, he still likes you.|`|d6jeBJGhaa	well you got to like not tell him because on the first part, he'll expect you to go and get a career singing and then expect you to get alot of money then he'll really like you, just because he wants it. so be carefull. but then if he is the nice type, he will respect you and help you probably get a career on singing. good luck.so just ask if he knows how to sing, unless you already know, and then say you can, and start singing your favorite song. but try to make it seem special.!!!!!!!!!!|`|Vfg4HkPAaa	Is his birthday coming up or your anniversary?Maybe you could set up a romantic night, or a picnic at the beach and spring it on him.Serenade him, I'm sure he will be amazed and probably be really proud of you.You will blow him away.<br>  Load some songs onto your i-pod to be your back up music if your self consious until you get use to singing to him, then it will just come naturally.Go for it.If he doesnt like it.Dont share it with him any more.|`|t40OmB7Aaa	When you are alone, act like you turn on the radio, and then sing away|`|BvJM1dgSaa	i dont think it would be a big deal, it might end up to be a pleasant surprise, go for it, im sure your guy will like it.<br>  If my GF suddenyl sang to me, i would be very impressed and happy of her.|`|gFLYQDeOaa	Start singing your fave song or something while he's with your or in the car to the radio.

RLLsH9oPaa	if she's 17 it's not surprising that she doesn't know what she wants...by the sounds of it you're ready for a committed mature relationship and she isn't... just hang on and be her friend for now...I know it's hard when you want to be with someone to be strong enough not to ... but it'll give her a chance to realize what she wants... I'm sure she doesn't really like her ex-boyfriend... she might have been trying to get a fight out of you...or maybe she just thinks she still has feelings for him. When you're with someone that long it's hard to just forget that you spent so much time trying to develop and feed a relationship with him and it didn't work out... but if she really does still have feelings for him then what she did was extremely wrong and hurtful and you should consider whether or not you can really truly forgive her for completely disregarding your feelings. Resentment is an awful thing to have in a relationship.|`|MMbg9CDKaa	Not hard, leave her.   If she truly wanted to be with you and/or has/had real feelings for you it wouldnt matter if her ex showed up to everything and anything there would be NO feelings.  but since there was, that should already answer your question.

Thats just dumb. If you can't decide, then the answer is neither.<br>  <br>  ALSO, its the best when you DONT get involved with people you work with, because if it goes sour, then its just always going to be awkward.
ea05859f8f81d87f783ba41e29be0a94aa	It actually doesnt matter what she does for me, there's no 1 thing that can top the other :) what matters is that she loves me, respects me and cares for me!<br>  <br>  The best thing is that she has been with me till now, no matter what has happened in our relationship in the past, so many years and love only grows stronger and not older. <br>  <br>  She has been with me whenever i needed her the most! And i miss her like crazy when she is not there!|`|LPlQcgHTaa	My wife had to drive 800 miles to see me in the hospital and help me get better.

0H3WdA4Naa	I find hugging from behind more fun and sensuous.  It places her hands closer to the groin  then when you hug from in front.  But it's not done to just any guy.<br>  <br>  Lil 1|`|zeUcqGGjaa	i see a behind hug to be really sweet and like shows the other person you care. it definatly more than friendly tho.|`|ea05859f8f81d87f783ba41e29be0a94aa	The behind one is more caring, and will definately spark a bigger smile.<br>  <br>  It also shows that u are physically close to that person (or u would like to be)<br>  <br>  the one from the front is casual, tho its nice too, but the back one is only for the person u love and a definately no no for friends.|`|0i74aBX3aa	I think there is a slight difference from behind it makes it more flirty and playful.. a front hug is more a cuddle and a behind is just a make you jump hug..|`|Nht72cXdaa	I always hug my boyfriend from behind :]<br>  <br>  It makes no difference to me, but is makes him smile so yeah.|`|LGAENfOaaa	A hug is a hug...its all showing affection|`|IHQrMLDuaa	there is no difference. me and my boyfriend do it all the time! i'm like best friends with my boyfriend's older sister (my boyfriend is younger than me). so every time i go over to their house i run right up to his bedroom and give him a huge hug from behind. then a little while later he usually does it to me. it is so romantic. i know it probably doesnt sound but it is. so yeah there really is no difference.|`|XWpPjw2saa	not really. i guess a hug from behind would kind of signify that you were dating that person...and usually guys hug girls from behind.|`|eZG2KtoPaa	I think both of them are expressing the same feelings.<br>  As to myself I love this kind of hugs. I think it reflects love,passion and happiness.|`|XN161Saeaa	nah just showing affection although when either my bf or I hug each other from behind, it usually leads to more.|`|nwqb7VV8aa	behind is playful|`|HYp16WENaa	no i dont think that makes a difference|`|sDpZaDHeaa	It means the same. I like you... ALOT...|`|DYJUdq08aa	I do that to guys all the time, and guys do it to me, so I both I assume.
ea05859f8f81d87f783ba41e29be0a94aa	No not at all, at least i don't think so narrow.<br>  <br>  In a relationship, someone has to take the effort, so start it and when troubles pour in, even to mend it.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't do anything, and even u don't bother, than who will.<br>  <br>  If a girl makes the first move, then 1 thing is sure, a guy would know that she finds him attractive, nice and a decent man worth asking out, and the girl could'nt wait anymore for the fun filled love life to start with this guy.<br>  <br>  I think all the girls should take the 1st step, coz most of the times the guys are shy.<br>  <br>  Even in my life, my girl only made the first move, i am so glad that she did :) wow, otherwise it is soooo difficult for the guy!<br>  <br>  Go ahead, do it :) best of luck!<br>  <br>  Let me know what happened :)
8p0TpLZ8aa	You may be a rebound, you know to fill a void he has. Or he may be trying to adjust to the new relationship and new woman. He may also still be in the process of getting over her.<br>  <br>  But in all truths I think you need to lay your cards on the table. Tell him your feelings and then ask him about his feelings. See where his head and heart are at. Sit down one on one, face to face. Listen to each other fully don't cut each other off, and try not to argue. <br>  <br>  No1 is wrong when it comes to feelings. Matters of the heart are no joke.This is the only way you will know whats going on in YOUR relationship. No1 else can tell you what your man is thinking but your man and your man wont know whats going on with you if you don't tell him. He may not realize how he is treating you because he is so consumed by his feelings...Just a suggestion.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped Good luck|`|ipLI8R8Jaa	No, you were just his rebound, you actually happen to be ugly, sorry dear.|`|Ho3jRLvyaa	maybe your not a convienience but maybe you should stop looking at how it affects just you maybe he really is tired and doesnt want to walk try new things though to keep the spark there|`|Rb30Wy8Jaa	honestly, he is the only one that can help you figure out where you stand. <br>  He says he still loves you, so believe in that. Does he have other things going on in his life? that could be why hes acting different. also, it could be that hes over the infatuation phase so he doesnt feel the need to constantly give you attention or treat u like a queen. these are just some suggestions.<br>  i advise you talk to him<br>  if u dont communicate now, then it will be harder as u go on.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|b4H4tWcRaa	ummm it seems like ya need to have the talk ..ask him wtas worn\g with him and if he says nothin then i think its time to move on or take a break ..because whne guys starts doin things like that is because they either have someone else or they jsut confused at the moment good lcuk|`|ea05859f8f81d87f783ba41e29be0a94aa	Being negative is not a good idea, first of all think positive, dont just see everything in a negative manner.<br>  <br>  Maybe things have soured a bit, but everything has a reason.<br>  find out what he is doing the entire day, is he working too hard, is he awake at nights, is he too much on the internet and on tv or games?<br>  <br>  Stress usually kicks in if u exert too much, but what is so important that he cant meet u? <br>  <br>  He blew up the plans but what wud u have done if u were in his place? Is his reason valid?<br>  <br>  Being self centered and dominant is not a good sign but ur love can change him, guys change, beleive me, if u love him and talk to him in a very sweet manner and make him understand, he will.<br>  <br>  BUT REMEMBER, u have to keep a smile on ur face and talk to him sweetly, talk to him in that manner ONLY, if u complain and nag, then u will only drive him away.<br>  <br>  He treated u like a queen, so talk to him, its not hard, ask him what is wrong, if u connect emotionally then the good times will be back.<br>  <br>  Best of luck :)|`|qpKwZ7B9aa	It would be a good idea to ask him to be honest with you about where you stand. He seems to be quite distracted by something else. What else could be more important than spending time with you. If you aren't his priority - maybe it is you that has to decide if this is what you want. I think you deserve someone who will be honest with you. You need to find out for yourself if this is what you want.

HrWJq9vYaa	Take a deep breath.....<br>  and another one.....<br>  look at him and smile.<br>  I mean look him in the eye, and hold the look and smile.  When you walk away look back and see if he is watching you.  If he spots you looking back that is a magic moment.  Be sure to smile and not be embarassed.<br>  Boys just want to be wanted too.  They want someone who is interested in them.  Find something you like about them and mention it.<br>  They are as self-conscious as you are, and looking for love too.  You do not have to be the prettiest, best dressed or most popular.<br>  Just relax...|`|CaAEucKPaa	One way to get noticed is talking about things that guys can relate to. If you share some of the same interests, talk to your guy friends about them (sports, cars, food etc..)|`|xGLGC6Lbaa	dont act like a friend act like someone that's interested like instead of just hittin' the park to play some ball, go to the movies or pool.. idk.|`|mSpZVHA1aa	idk im a guy|`|xdnGjioUaa	It should just come naturally... if you have to tryyy then thats too much, just be yourself|`|0f780fa6f035882050ed2e4c8fdedd3caa	the eternal question.... i have no idea either

You can't really tell if its the first time someone has made out|`|xdnGjioUaa	we wouldnt know how he knew... we didnt kiss you|`|YJgWyipLaa	He probably could tell by your hesitation or your technique. A good rule of thumb when you are uncertain is to follow his lead that way your doing exactly what he does. When you become more practiced you will develop your own style but definitely stay away from going around in circles. Try in and out slowly or nibbling (lightly )on his lips,ears,neck. Or gently sucking.|`|rrtb5Ttnaa	well, everyone first kiss isn't going to be amazing like they wish it would be. More you kiss, the more you get better. Practise makes perfect, right?|`|UhwoI8uTaa	Of course he knows you didn`t know how because, I`m guessing he`s your first boyfriend ? <br>  He`s just trying to get in your head . ;) ?|`|U7PnFxHVaa	tell him that he's probably the one who doesn't know how, or maybe he was just joking around wirh you... hope that helps.
22iiYBSFaa	i've had the same problem.....i think what works the best is not to mention your bf in front of her (the jealousy will just start up again) and to balance bf w/ bff. just have 1 girl day where you two just talk about w/e w/o ur bf, and the next day have just a you and ur bf day. works for me ^_^|`|40f23105eaa010ba59cad3e90a0586d9aa	You could tell your friend how much her friendship has meant to you over the years but that your boyfriend is important to you.  It does really sound that she is missing her friendship with you and is lashing out at you.  You could try to be really nice to her about it at first, to see if you can reassure her.  If she continues to make your life hard and be mean to you, then I think maybe  in a nice way you can "take a break" from the friendship for now.  You don't have to resort to being cruel or mean-you can just be more unavailable.  Maybe in time she will find herself a boyfriend and won't feel so insecure, and you could be friends again.|`|07HvD6oLaa	You must feel a strong bond with this friend because you are willing to put her jealousy aside in order to save your friendship. If she is not willing to do the same then I'm afraid it might be the end of your friendship. Talk to her, and ask her what's going on, don't even mention your boyfriend. Who knows she might be going through something.|`|T2Ksl6dDaa	i understand she might be having feelins for ur bf.dont be rude in saying anything to her . i think its not her fault everybody at teenage can have such feelings. talk on this matter with her in a friendly way and tell her ur relations and say her not to do so if she say yes.do remember dont quarrel with her as she is more imp in ur life.dont ever dare to lose ur best friend for a boy...... mark my ans best if u think. take my advise seriously.|`|IDy5JWJxaa	your bf is right. but think twice since she is your friend from KG.<br>  wait and speak to her again after some time. she will understand|`|Vg9aFdoAaa	u should talk to her without ur man and see wats goin on|`|tZQWzaPKaa	i say go back and talk to her. tell her how you feel. be just as open as the question you asked here. say why are you flirting with MY boyfriend...you have been acting very mad for a while and i just want to know why. tell her you feel like shes making some changes that you dont feel comfortable with and you really care for her and want to work this out. she is probably jelous because she doesnt have a boyfriend so help her get one. then go on a double date. <br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!!!!!!|`|DebcHwWuaa	Talk Face 2 Face<br>  <br>  I foyu two are REALLY best friends like you say you are, this will work.<br>  <br>  If she values the friendship as much as you do then you guyz shld be able to resolve this.
ASnUAkBtaa	go to the same parties, get to know her, take her home with you and go start making out on your bed, try to unbuckle her pants while kissing and if she lets you, that is a good sign. plz have protection though and make sure she is the right one!|`|huOUB7sCaa	u only want to do her because she is hot?? dont u like her for her personality? or something else besides her gorgeous body and face?    if u want to, tell her and just do it!!|`|I3xFJfmTaa	Sex should be something special not something you do with whoever.

And if they don't then you will. Then just ignore them if you really want to.<br>  <br>  Yes. There is no one who can tell you who to go out with and who shouldn't .

I was really nervous the first time I made out which was actually with my best friend who became my boyfriend a day later. aha good luck though :) I dont think I helped too much|`|Hm7suHKTaa	ugh, so am i!<br>  lol. i'm dying to kiss my new bf, but i' cant just do it! hopefully he makes his move. hah. but anyway, everyone seems to say:<br>  <br>  bad kissers qualify as: <br>  -they shove their tounge down your throat<br>  -they don't give enough tounge<br>  (so basically, just give enough tounge to slide around, go nice and slow)<br>  -bad breath is completely badddd! and dont use gum. locks in bad breath germs. so pop in a mint, but make sure you swallow it before you go in for the kiss. dont want them to think they got one of you teeth! =b<br>  -no chapped lips. gross.<br>  <br>  good luck. hah.<br>  i prolly shouldnt be giving advice on this, but figured i'd pass it along.|`|lQxDbQWzaa	Bad kissers usually either have bad breath, they open their mouth too wide and try to swallow your face or they slobber all over you! As long as you avoid those three things, you'll be a good kisser!|`|f5qFFFMvaa	First you need to think if they are worth kissing. <br>  Kisses are precious and should not be wasted on just anybody. <br>  <br>  If you don't believe that kisses are important, then read Matthew 26:48," Now His betrayer had given them a signal, saying, 'Whomever I KISS, He is the One; seize him and lead Him away.'' <br>  The savior of our world was betrayed by a kiss. <br>  <br>  King David said in Psalm 109:30, "I WILL GREATLY PRAISE THE LORD WITH MY MOUTH." <br>  <br>  Before you "make out", think about it and see if you are praising the Lord with your mouth and in everything that you do.<br>  <br>  "Because Your loving kindness is better than life, my LIPS shall praise you," Psalm 63:3|`|LCUp1FWraa	Well are you a girl or a boy and how old are you?|`|GKPfXMfOaa	lol..i want to see the best answer for this one (which i know isn't me lol)|`|3qxuCi1Daa	idk cus im in the same boat as u!!
pmtJWCZJaa	Unless you are both agreeing to see other people and do things with other people... Neither of them should be doing anything with anyone else .. i don't think that cheating is ever okay like really.... Yes, sex and love are 2 very different things but you shoudnt be sleeping around with other people if you are truly in love with ur partner.... If the person you are with is having sex with people that aren't you than you really shouldn't be with that person because he obviously doesn't care enough about you to just be with you <br>  <br>  Hope I helped ^^|`|tSlt4UuIaa	Sex and love are two completely different things. Sex can mean nothing if the two people don't even love eachother. It's just intercourse. But it's always wrong if your boyfriend cheats on you. It's never right, because he's in a relationship with you, not other girls. Especially if he has sex with another girl. That's bad. But it doesn't necessarily mean he loves her. It takes more than a one-night-stand to actually fall in love with someone :]|`|IhpH6WmFaa	when you go out with someone you do need too be in love with them and nor do you need to shag them<br>  if you do shag them it makes your relacionships a lot more complicated. if you love someone unless your quite a strange person you will not cheat on the other.<br>  if you do get cheated on your other half is obviously unhappy with you hense his cheating. find out what has happened and sort it. if you ever cheat on someone , love them and shag them you'll know the truth as the soloution for this is on fact subjective( ACCORDING TO THE PERSON)|`|478bbd08565322557d0320411cf54a5daa	I think you need to defferentiate between right and hurt. Sex is not about love, a person could have sex with someone they don't love, and they could have sex with someone when they are in love with somone else. You might be hurt by it, but it doesn't make it wrong, it just means that your feelings were not as important as his biological urges.|`|4MnEkq4qaa	Sex and love can exist completely seperately. you can be in love with someone and not have sex with them, or you can have sex with someone and not love them. But when combined, these two things are f-ing amazing...  although having sex without love is fun, fun is no excuse for breaking something special like love. cheating is never right.|`|ApLttDthaa	Yes they are very different.  If someone cheats it doesn't mean they don't love you.  They are just weak and have given in to their animal urges.  If they don't love you they will leave you - simple as that.  It's up to you how much you want to hang on to him.|`|AV39LYM7aa	persoanlly i feel..if my bf loved someone else..it would hurt me more than to find out he ****** someone else b/c its more than just the physical aspect btw them. they're both wrong..its the fact that if he loved you..he would also have the respect to not cheat on you.|`|wsDThzxJaa	Of course, sex and love are different things. Sex is purely physical while love is spiritual. you don't have to love someone to have sex with them.|`|AA11632154	In my opinion sex and love are 2 different things, but they are interlinked and I think that if a guy loves you he would not cheat on you.|`|U60Eewo2aa	U shd have sex only with the person whom u love...|`|1zl3nydfaa	i do think sex and love r to dfferet things but if a guy cheats on u that is wrong|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Two peas in a pod.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Sex and love are two different things. Sex does not equal love. Love does not necessarily need sex.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend cheated on you because he has no discipline and didn't really care about you.|`|5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	Sex and Love are two different things that relate to each other. <br>  You usually are in love when you have sex but in some cases it does not apply. <br>  Ex. Prostitution, Drunk mistakes... etc...<br>  I believe that someone who is truly in love won't cheat either unless if he was under the influence of something mind altering like marijuana or.alcohol.|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	love and sex is not different because nobody should have sex with someone that they dont love that's y people say making love|`|ZYyzCeoeaa	No it doesn't, cheating is hardly ever ( if that) right.|`|puJDytefaa	NO, I don't think so. I would find out the reason why he cheated on u, and then decide from there what to do.

Pobd7nnIaa	how well guys pay attention to what girls want and need. we like when men do romantic things for us. and when we don't have to tell them what they want. basically, when they aren't selfish and do things they know we'll like and is only to make us happy. well, that's what i like, anyway but other girls will agree with that|`|or9QslAPaa	Well a lot of girls are different.<br>  <br>  I like intelligence that matches mine.

Q5A6bhRcaa	i used to say the same thing now im 22 with 4 children protection fails , it did for me all four times, the pill, the patch, the shot, and condoms so unless you want to be a parent wait not only till your married but also till your ready to change diapers and have feedings every hour and a half.   no sleep, no energy and a persistant headach.   so remind your self of those things not if it happens it happens.  but on the positive side i would not change my children in for all the sanity in the world|`|8hmWep8xaa	Its good you say that.

S6vz32Khaa	I think so, yes. If you think about it, what a special gift for that special person you end up with that no one else has been with you and there are no emotional issues from being involved before, not to mention you would know for sure you are disease free. It couldn't get any better than that for your special person. I think you would feel you had something of value and very special to offer the right one. WAIT !!!|`|2VzjTo0Yaa	In my opinion, sex is always better when reserved for marriage because in most cases you can enjoy it to the fullest without any past regrets or fear/risk of getting STDs.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, whether inside or outside of marriage, be prudent who you choose to share your body with. Regrets can and will stick.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|7lKy0tTnaa	well, it all depends, now a days people...basically dont care about that, theres teens having sex at VERY early age and stuff, but its ur choice, if u happened to have sex with a guy u really like, just make sure he wares protection.|`|AA11733674	yes you should , and it is the best way to show your husband that you care about him and about his reputation, and to keep his love forever.. good luck|`|d8LLGhT1aa	Yes!|`|rKlBGf2iaa	Yes...I am...and I know it will be worth it :)|`|govpgOhqaa	In my opinion, yes.<br>  But if you know that you won't be dedicated to staying a virgin, then why promise that. If you think that you will be able to make that promise and keep it, then i can guarantee you that it's the best choice. <br>  |`|7XbXvsNHaa	YES|`|LFY5Zdvraa	Maybe? It depends on what happens and how you feel. I suggest that you wait at least until your 16 or 17 before you have sex with the opposite sex. What I strongly recommend, is that you ALWAYS use condoms. There is no excuse today for any young person to contract HPV, Chlamydia, Herpes, HIV or any other STD. Be smart and protect yourself. All of this can affect you and ruin your life when you get older. You can get cervical cancer from HPV many years after you are infected. There are no signs or symptoms of the virus that tell you that you have it. Just be careful and use protection.|`|OyKASfoqaa	i say dont rush anything! if you think your ready before then go for it but dont rush it and if you can hold out till marriage then thats great more power to ya!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  by the way im a virgin tooo!|`|IpGtRBh1aa	Don't leave a decision of that magnitude to people you don't know on the internet. Wait until you're ready and can do it with no regrets.<br>  I'm not here to make your life choices for you.|`|QFgiHZ5kaa	absolutely!!!
