I even store cans and dry food in the fridge lol. I store all my dishes in the dishwasher, because the thought of them crawling over them in the cabinets is disgusting. Pots and pans are stored in the oven. Cabinets are bare! Kitchen is pretty bare too! Dishes are washed immediately. Trash is taken out daily.       And stillll.... they remain! So I've had enough and I'm moving. But, my question is... when I move, will they somehow move with us? Like lay their eggs in the furniture or something?? I dunno, I just don't wanna move and then have them there all over again!

20090220103513AAJ0iON	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	We have found massive amounts of building debris in our front and back yards. Some of it glowed. Toxic?	We built our home 6 years ago in a beautiful neighborhood. There was an existing 100 yr old pecan tree in back and we chose our lot based on that. The builder also supplied three other trees and complete sod in the front yard. We had them plant two elms in the front and one in back. We also paid almost $2000 extra to place sod in back. The elm in back died within a month and the grass deteriorated shortly after. We decided recently to grow grass in the back and after several attempts with seeding and sodding we had no luck. I thought aeration might help but everytime something was placed in the ground we pulled out various building materials... shingles, drywall, rusted metal, nails and tools. I worked night and day to remove as much as possible and encountered something strange. When I would dig at night I would sometimes hit something with my shovel that gave a soft pinkish glow. The light would fade after about 5 seconds. It usually occurred in the top 1 to 6 inches of the soil. Anyone ever heard of this and is it harmful? Our builder was Engle homes who now have lawsuits filed against them for building on old bombsites. I don't think we have bombs to worry about but I wonder what else may be down there!!

The janitor's closet has all kinds of really strong restroom cleaners, disinfectants, glass cleaners and floor restoring chemicals, but individual consumers are not allowed to purchase these chemicals from the company that manufactures them (Kay Chemical Company). Why not? These are very strong and much better than the cleaners that you buy from a store. Why are they for industrial use only? Are they unsafe for residential use?

20090220205828AA5Eh96	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Central Heating Outdoor Unit?	Alright, I live in SE KY and our house has central air and heating. I sort of have an idea as to how the system works, but my room mate thinks he knows everything and of course did something today that seemed illogical to me. We bought some new furniture yesterday and he took one of the big boxes and covered the outdoor unit. His reasoning was that it would keep the heat inside of the unit instead of blowing the hot air outside. Now I just got home from work and the thermostat reads 66 and it is set to 69. It is about 20 outside so I went outside to check on the heating unit. The area of the cardboard box covering the unit had a small hole towards the top and it was blowing cold air out of it. I decided to make the hole bigger to allow more air to escape, and since the air is cold, I am certain the we aren't keeping any "warm air" trapped, therefor I have concluded that my room mate is full of ****. Now I need to know if I should go remove the box from the outdoor unit to allow proper circulation or if my roommate was actually correct and our heater isn't keeping up for some other reason. Weather he is right or wrong, please explain so I can understand and explain it to him tomorrow.

I know that dryers, of course, require a lot of power to particularly power the heating element. But washers use a standard 2 prong plug, and use quite a bit of electricity, themselves. So...does a 2 prong dryer exist, or no?

20090220215146AAL0fnY	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Hot water at faucet get cold real fast?	Not sure how to word this..  when I turn on the hot water at either of 2 of the facuets in my house, it takes a few seconds to get hot water.  Ok, this is normal, but after I use the hot water and turn off the facuet, if I turn it back on the water is already cold again and it takes a while to get hot again.  This can be even after only 1 minute of having hot water.  There should be hot water still in the line even after I turn it off.  Any ideas why is this?
