20090305075056AAl5YRe	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How to wire a 220v 50amp outlet, with 3 wires?	I have two questions that I've been getting conflicting answers and I'm hoping this will help. I installed a 220v 2post lift in my garage recently. The garage has a 50amp outlet with a 50amp breaker. The lift motor only draws 18-20amps. Would it be wise to lower the breaker size in this situation?       And secondly (most importantly), the lift motor is a 3 wire configuration, Green, White and Black. The 50amp recepticle is a 4 wire (Green, Black, White and Red). According to the lift directions, the white and black are both 110v and the green is ground. The recepticle considers the white neutral. Should I wire the lift motor's white and black to the two side posts on the recepticle (black and red), the green to the green on the recepticle (top) and the bottom of the recepticle leave open? I have a unshielded (wrapped in paper) wire that isnt connected (4 wire 220v, 20ft of wire I purchased from HD, goes from the lift motor to the recepticle).

20090305075644AAitJUD	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	What's adequate protection against fiber glass dust?	I'm working in a boat builder's, and they use normal dust masks. Not N95 ones. i've bought myself a simple filtering mask against non-toxic vapours such as spray paint.      I'm I better protected than the rest? Is it even necessary?      I read online that fiber glass dust eventually leaves the body and lungs without harming you (too much) as opposed to asbestos particles, which, by their form keep cutting into the alveoles of the lungs.
20090305080318AANpWzu	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	How much would you pay...?	We are in the process of remodeling (because of a minor flood in the house) and we need a few things done. We have friends that are willing to help us so I need to know how much to pay them.      How much per hour would you pay someone to help you install laminate flooring?   How much would you pay someone to reattach a toilet?      I don't know how much it would cost to hire someone to do it so that's why I'm asking here.
20090305080433AAlA6Zw	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Should I have house rewired? Built in 1946.?	My house has old two-prong outlets without the third safety ground. My downstairs is unfinished. Should I have the complete house re-wired with the three-prong outlets before finishing the downstairs or leave it. I don't have alot of money & plan to have friends assist with finishing the downstairs (drywall, carpet, etc).    It is inconvienient to have extension cords/circuit protectors at every outlet so I can plug modern day electronics in.       Would most people rewire and older home? Or leave it as is? (I am not a handy type person so this would need a hired professional.)

20090305081929AAft6mw	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	What causes bubbles in dried paint?	We bought our house about a year and a half ago & just noticed the paint in our son's room is bubbled up. It was painted before we moved in & the bubbling only occurs on one wall...about a 5ft X 3ft section. When you touch the bubbled paint, it cracks like an eggshell & we can't seem to find any moisture coming from anywhere..unless it is somehow coming through the brick on the front of the house (is that possible??). Also, underneath the cracking paint is a chaulky white/grey substance. We don't want to call someone and get ripped off (someone telling us we have to replace the wall when we really don't) & we don't want to repaint until we know it won't happen again. Like I said, there is no water leaking through the roof and there isn't anything seeping up from underneath. Any ideas what could cause this & what we could do to correct it? I will try to post a photo later if that helps. Thanks!
