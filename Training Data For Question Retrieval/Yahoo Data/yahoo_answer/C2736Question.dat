20090226095857AAiva2h	Pets;Cats	How well will a cat fit into my life style?	Hi, i really want a dog but we do not have enough space for one so we thought we could get a cat. But we don't know if a cat will fit into our life style.         The youngest child is almost 11. we have four large rooms in our house and two small rooms. We have a patio outside.The children in the family are careful with animals. We usually all only go away for about 4 days in the whole year. We will not leave the cat at home alone for more then about 3 hours.    Would a cat suit our life style? And would a dog fit our life style.

My guinea pig ginger doesn't walk,she is obese and she doesn't show any interest of climbing what so ever. I want to train her some tricks but if she doesn't even walk then doing tricks is sooo long to go. I tried to write up a menu for ginger so she has more veg's than guinea pig food and i don't think it works. Please help me and ginger.

20090226101858AAdrIox	Pets;Cats	Kind Kitten Gone Mad?	Hi all,      My family has a kitten, it's been the nicest thing for a long time now (around 6 months I want to say).  It's played with our ferret, loves the 2 dogs, and realizes the other 2 cats are just there (they like to be left alone).        However, we had to take my grandmother's cat into our home this past weekend.  Her cat hides in the basement at all times but they met once and the kitten wasn't too happy.  After that he's been acting weird - Always meow'ing for attention, then when you try to pick him up he'll meow like he's in pain (but isn't as far as I know) then scratch at you and try to get away.  He won't hiss while he does this though.      I should probably mention that he also isn't neutered just yet (he will be next week).      Can anyone give some advice as to what may be happening with him?  Thanks for your time!

I'm going to get a cockatiel, but first I want the cage set up...since alot of people don't buy a cage until they get the cockatiel...but I am going to set my cage up first.      So first, I don't want to spend over $200 on a cage. I know everyone is gonna think I'm a bad person, but honestly, I can throw that extra 200 for other places more useful and I know there are cheaper cages out there that don't cost $200+. (So if you know of a great deal for a perfect cage for a cockatiel please link it to me)      BUT      What is the bar spacing supposed to be? Like from what to what? I look at some cages that have 5/8 bar spacing, but it looks really far apart and looks big enough that the tiel's head would stuck.      So please, someone help me! I can't find any site that gives bar spacing for birds!

OK, I did ask this before, but i need to rephrase it because people are too stupid to get what I am trying to ask! My boyfriend and I just adopted a 2 year old Chihuahua-pug mix from my mother who was fostering him from a rescue place, who said he was a stray dog. We used to let him out 3 times a day and even though we did that, he would come in an poop anyway. He is pooping less, but still doing it. We let him out 2 times a day now. My boyfriend and I both have 9 to 5 jobs, so we can’t be with him every minute of the day! We can’t let him out every hour when we are not home! We can, however do this on the weekends. He does not let us know when he has to go. He just runs someone where and comes back within 5 minutes already having done his business. How do we stop this from happening? We use his crate for bed time and when we can’t watch him.

How do you go about figuring out what sets a dog off about a person.      He came in last night, she smelt him, he petted her and then the barking began.  Then she would quit and it would begin again.      I just cannot figure out why she would be fine with everyone at home, in public at dog parks etc but these 2 people she cannot stop barking at.

Now I want a puppy (so I can raise him/her myself).  Specifically, I am thinking of a lab or a great dane (a large dog).  However, some people are telling me I should not get one because my husband and I both work during the day.  I could take at least a week off of work when I get one though (to help get him/her acclimated and start training)... and I am willing to pay someone to come walk the dog during the day.  Is it wrong to keep a dog/puppy at home alone all day while we are at work (about 10 hours Mon-Fri)? I feel like other people must do it... Thank you for your advice!

20090226140256AAcYyQL	Pets;Dogs	Have you ever experienced this with your dog?	First off..just to let you all know I have an appointment with the vet.   Here is my concern, I brought my Sheltie to work with me a couple days ago, she has a water bowl here just for her. I filled it up with filtered water. She guzzled it down, I filled it up again, same thing. She drank 3 bowls before she stopped. Since then, she has been drinking a lot of water at home but not going to potty anymore then normal. My research so far has led me to diabetes. Could that be the problem? If so, what other symptoms should I watch for until her vet visit? AND, what would the treatment for her be if it is diabetes?

My dog is so wonderful with the kitten, but is a little frightened to be too close or when the kitten hisses at him.  My kitten thinks he's billy-bad-boy and will follow my dog around and then hiss and walk off when he's done.  LOL  I've done the trick with having the dog lay down and holding the cat and giving them both treats, which has been a good experience.  After the first day of doing that, the kitten was sleepy and walked over to my dog and laid right next to him!  When the dog saw him, he jumped up, concerned the kitten was going to get him.  They seem to be on the right track, but I'm open to pointers, because my animals are almost as much my kids AS my kids!  LOL  I want everyone to get along.  =)

20090226115046AAYTPIj	Pets;Dogs	Minnesota  SF 2876/HF 2906—Dangerous Dogs?	Minnesota    SF 2876/HF 2906—Dangerous Dogs    Effective: August 1, 2008    This legislation resulted in a comprehensive, breed-neutral dangerous dog law that requires individual dogs who have been designated “dangerous” to be sterilized. The law also prevents reckless owners convicted of violating the dangerous dog provisions from owning dogs and allows owners to contest the “dangerous” designation through appeal. Laws like this are the smart alternative to breed-discriminatory laws, which ban or regulate certain breeds of dog wholesale in the hope of reducing dog attacks.       What do you think as far as this being a differnt way to handle dangerous dogs?       I think it works better then just outright banning the breed. It at least is a step in the right direction.      Anyone agree?

20090226140756AAC7qnY	Pets;Dogs	Just wondering what you all thought of pit bulls?	here in the uk pit bulls are illegal, so i don't really know that much about them. all you hear about is people getting savaged by them, and using them to fight. but i've seen a few questions where people are asking about a breed of dog to get and a lot of people say pits, saying they are good with children etc. so i was just wondering if anyone had any experience with them and what they are actually like, as i don't want to just judge the dog by its bad press. i'm aware that breeds like this get a bad press because a lot of the people that own them act irresponsible with them and use them as a status symbol. but this can't be the case with them all. so, what do you think?

I am embarrassed to bring this dog to the vet but I am going to anyway.  I am going to keep him at my house after that and take care of him.

My dog is a one year old female pitbull, she lives with my other 2 rescue dogs and myself in my large home in Arkansas. She gets alot of exercise, she gets walked atleast twice a day, and then she is frequently outside with the other 2 dogs.  I have tried different collars, and even harness and she still manages to get out of them. I need help, everytime she gets out she runs around like she's never been outside before, she doesn't listen and she doesn't come when she's called. I'm afraid that she's going to get hit by a car, or picked up by someone and I won't be able to get her back. I've tried everything. I've read books, i've tried crating her, i've tried rewarding her once she's been caught, i've tried gates at the doors and even teaching her to sit before she exits the house, but it doesn't seem like anything is working. I'm a responsible owner, i don't want anything to happen to my dog i need some seriouse suggestions from someone that knows!!!

This morning, during his walk, he started wobbling, fell on his side with his tongue hanging out and started panting heavily. I brought him to the vet immediately. The vet said he had fluid in his lungs and gave him an injection of Lasix (not sure of the spelling) which is a diahretic, which the vet claimed would help drain the fluid. Almost immediately after, my pug fell to his side again, only this time he went very limp and hardly breathing. They took my pug and said they needed to put him in an oxygen tank overnight. This all happened today and I haven't gotten my dog back yet ... I need to call back tomorrow for any results. How do I know for sure the vet gave him the right medication or even the right treatment ... and if they didn't and something happens to my puglet, what should I do next?

20090226151306AATS7mY	Pets;Dogs	Have you encountered this?	There was a HUGE article in my paper today about the effects of domestic violence on pets. There is a cat on the front of the paper who is terrified of humans to this day because of domestic violence. They also highlighted other instances: A man would kick, hit, throw the family dog around when he was upset at his family. A man took his family out to the edge of his driveway, lined them up according to age with the dog last...he then shot and killed the dog, threatening to do the same to his family if they didn't obey him. Another person would hide his wife's bird everytime he left or beat her because he knew that she wouldn't leave without it.      Have you ever encountered a pet that has long-lasting effects of domestic violence? In rescue, personal life, or otherwise?      I believe I have...Getting to know my adopted cat, Angus has been a joy in my life but I've noticed he likes to chew on plastic...not ingest it but just chew it..he finds it enjoyable. Of course...I don't let him do it but last night he was sitting with me and began to chew on the corner of a zip lock bag with my M&M's inside. When I went to pet Ang...he flinched back from my hand...afraid I was going to hit him. There have also been other smaller instances when he has shied away from my hand.

She says she doesnt ever scoop the poop or pee out of it - she just waits til the whole thing has to be emptied every one or two weeks.  Now, I grew up with cats and I always scooped their poop every day.        My friend INSISTS that the cat doesn't mind and that he never has any health or behavioral problems because of it.  I tried to tell her that she really needs to clean it every day but I really couldn't back up what I was saying because I dont know what the health risks are to the cat when you don't scoop every day.      Can anyone here tell me what might happen to her kitty (sickness or otherwise) so that I can hopefully get her take better care of him?        PS- the cat IS healthy, alert, well adjusted, etc.  He hasn't been sick ever but I do suspect it's only a matter of time....I feel bad for him.      Thank you in advance!!!!

20090225113946AA4GzQ6	Pets;Dogs	How do I stop the barking...?	My puppy is overall a very well behaved dog.  The problem I am having is that he barks uncontrollably when new people come to the house.  I am at my wits end and don't know how to stop this.  He is an extremely sweet and friendly dog, but he just seems to be pretty territorial about his house.  I don't know how to correct this behavior without using an e-collar (which I really can't imagine doing to him!).  My house does not have doors on rooms so I can't put him in another room (not sure that corrects the behavior anyways).  I refuse to put him in his crate because I want to keep that his comfortable place, not a place for punishment.  I will take him to a trainer if necessary but I am hoping there is something I can do to correct this situation myself.  I have heard of people having guests bring treats, but I want this to work for ALL people who stop, including delivery people.  Thanks for any suggestions you can give me!

20090225114356AAM6zya	Pets;Cats	Is it common for cats to have strokes?	My cat that I have had for 13 years has been acting strange lately. When we first got her, we believed that she must have been very old. She was a stray & it took us almost 2 years to get her to come inside. For the past couple of years, she has become rather skinny, but tends to eat a lot. She also seemed to vomit a lot. This, however, is not my latest concern. My mother believed that she might have had cancer, but her symptoms had come & gone, so we didn't feel the need to do much about it, except for the normal routine check up on her.       A couple of nights ago, I came home to find that she was sitting in the kitchen floor with one eye closed.. the other half closed as if she couldn't see. She is very lovable & always wants attention. I tried to lay down on the floor to see if she would come to me, and after a while of saying her name, she tried to walk toward me. She fell over as if she couldn't move the left side of her body. I knew that something was wrong, and my mom decided to take her to the vet the next day as she believed it was a stroke. She got progressively worse within hours. She was laying in the litter box, and when moved out of it.. went right back to it. She wouldn't drink or eat. When my mom went to look for her the next morning to take her to the vet, she was no where to be found. She continued to get worse, making strange noises that she has never made before, and needing walls & furniture for support to move around. We made the decision to have her put to sleep this morning, as she had blood all around her mouth, and mom figured it must have been bleeding from the brain. The vet stated that she must have been the sickest cat that they have ever seen live this long, and diagnosed her with both, a stroke, and cancer. It was extremely sad to see an animal in so much pain.       I was just wondering.. is it common for felines to have strokes?

I have decided that I am not going to live in cat urine for the rest of my life but I've talked to several different people and they either say that I should give him another chance to find a home by taking him to the humane society, and others say that the humane thing to do is to have him put to sleep.

The first day I had him I fed him canned food -- he ate a little tiny bit -- then he didnt want any more of that, i tried everything, I swtiched slowly to dry food which he seemed to like at first, now hes back up to the same tricks with his eating habits, I have tried purina one, pedigree small breed, and today I bought some small breed proplan, he hasnt really seemed to want that either, he goes to his bowl sniffs licks his lips then goes back to whatever he was doing, I just got him treats he likes today-- He didnt want any of those either until I found these and he spent like 15mins chewing and that was it, what do you think I should do, the vet says hes healthy he just doesnt eat much, he eats probably about 20 small kibble per sitting, is this normal for a chi??
20090226153441AA7dZEQ	Pets;Dogs	My puppy is  "housebroken" but still has  accidents by the door if I  don't let him out right  away.?	He is 4 months old, and knows he's supposed to go outside.  But if he goes to the door and I don't let him out right away, he'll go on the floor.  It doesn't seem to be a matter of being able to hold it (he holds it up to 5 hours in his kennel when we're gone) but will go to the door every 1-2 hours if he's out.  I KNOW he can wait longer, but how do I tell him he HAS to hold it, even outside his kennel?

20090225114752AAnnR9p	Pets;Reptiles	Lazy Bearded Dragon help please!?	My Bearded Dragon, Rocky, has been very lazy recently. He's always been lazy since we got him and I was wondering if something was making him lazy. I'm getting him a new UV bulb, a really strong one, in a few days. It's 10.0 UVB. He recently got a new heat lamp and has tiles as substrate. He usually walks quite slowly and the most exercise he gets is probably jumping up the stairs. However I have seen many other bearded dragons which run very fast and compared to them, Rocky is lethargic. He is usually hand fed as he doesnt bother to eat things himself and would rather wait for a cricket to run into his mouth than chase after it. He is fed daily and has a fresh supply of lettuce. I change his diet regularly, for example, for 1-2 weeks he'd be on mealworms, then the next week waxworms, then maybe locusts, sometimes a mix. I'm trying to give as much detail as possible. He is coming up to about 1 and a half soon. I give him a bath at least once a month. Please help!    Picture of his enclosure:       http://img527.imageshack.us/my.php?image...       Remember it now has a tile substrate and uv light is up above. He has a water dish and a veggie dish as well as a main basking log. Please help as I want to get Rocky active.

Do you have to have a USDA license to breed them? I heard that you can show them, do they judged them based on conformation, fur, etc.? What is a good kind of food to feed them, do they require any special foods like sugar gliders? Are males better than females or vice-versa?

20090226160250AALqhTr	Pets;Fish	I may be out of orderhere, but how do we tell you when your fish is going to give birth?	I've seen a lot of questions about fish and giving birth. The main question is when..but since we (the people you are asking) didn't see the fish bred, don't have a current picture of it, or can actually see it...how are we expected to give you a exact time? We can guess..and most do a good job. but one questioner demanded to know if his fish was going to give birth that day! We can tell you if it sounds like "soon" but no one can tell you an exact time! Only the fish knows the exact time and she's not going to tell. Have others wondered about this?

20090226163131AAtmwg6	Pets;Dogs	What does it mean when a dog?	Let's say you're in a field and at the edge, theres a fence between the field and the backyards of the houses on the street behind. It's a metal fence. You see a dog, approach it, and it comes towards you, but he does not bark or wag is tail or hang its tongue out. It halts right before the fence, staring at you. Again, he doesn't pant, wag his tail, bark, or anything...just stares at you. Would you consider this a friendly dog or a dog that's waiting for a cautious movement before making a decision to whether you're someone intruding.

20090226162140AA1C9q4	Pets;Fish	What happened? I just found my cory dead?	I just got home about an hour ago, and looked in my tank and realized that one of my albino corydoras is dead. ='[      He had no obvious signs of illness, and I tested the water and everything was perfect. He ate last night and was fine this morning, but when I came home he was dead. I have four corydoras (all albino), and they're all fine, and so are my other fish.       I'm not sure if this helps any, but he was missing both of his fins, but I thought he was doing better because they were growing back nicely. (I had him for about six months, he was fully grown, and had no swiming problems despite the missing fins.)      Any ideas? Suggestions? Anything at all? I'll be  grateful for anything.      .:Thank-you:.

20090226162840AAWS8ZE	Pets;Dogs	My dog pees every hour, sometimes more, but it is not a medical issue.. any tips?	My 7 month old yorkie mix pees every hour, sometimes every 40 minutes. She has had a urinalysis, a urine culture and blood work, all of which came back normal, so it is not a medical issue. The vet said it was behavioral. She knows to pee outside when we take her, but when we try to extend the amount of time even by a few minutes, she will pee in the house. She also poops in the house, probably because she thinks its ok since she pees there too.  I cannot take her out every hour for her whole life, its just too much. She is able to hold it all night and in her crate during the day, so I know she can hold it, she just won't.  It is like as soon as she gets the slightest urge to go, she just goes with no warning. She will not go to the door, and we have tried the bell thing, and she would not touch it. I am thinking about sending her to my trainers house for a week to be house trained, but it is expensive. I know it is my responsibility to teach, but the vet said her case needs professional training and it has been 6 months, and she is ruining the floors. Any tips? Has anyone had this problem? Has anyone else sent their dog to a trainers home to be house trained, and if so, did it work?

20090226160429AALQBNp	Pets;Rodents	Guinea pig has two red dry spots of skin on back?	My piggy Murray is having a little problem. On his back near his hips there are two red dry spots of skin. I noticed these a couple of weeks ago but they were not nearly as red or dry. I also believe he has been losing his hair in these areas, although it is not a significant loss I have also noticed some hair in his cage and bedding. When touching the area and the hair surrounding it seems short and spiky likes he’s been chewing it. I was wondering if there was something I could feed him to help this or something I could put on it. I do not believe he is ill, he is still quite lively as he always has been and is eating and drinking normally. We do live in a climate that is VERY dry in the winter so I think this is causing or making the problem worse.

20090226162340AAZiBdY	Pets;Rodents	My rat, George, has an inner-ear infection, and now his eye is looking bad. What can I use to clean it?	George, is a dumbo rat. He apparently had been bitten before I bought, so he got an abscess, we took him to the vet to get medication for that, and it healed up nicely, except for the drainage, the abscess drained into his left ear. So now he has the inner-ear infection, which he is on medication for that now. Now, due to the pressure behind his left eye, it's bulging out and its very dry and a bit gross. I don't want him to end up losing that eye, seeing how he is going to have his head cocked to the left permanently. So, the question is, what is a pet safe, store-product I can use for his poor little eye.   Thank you for any suggestions
