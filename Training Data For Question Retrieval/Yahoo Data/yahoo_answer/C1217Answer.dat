CY495kiYaa	OK, here's the gist of a black hole:    There is a "fabric" of the universe called spacetime.  Spacetime allows us to describe the POSITION and TIME during which events happen and is 4-dimensional (3 space dimensions + 1 time = 4 dimensions).    Einstein brilliantly discovered that the space and time around us is NOT STATIC.  It can bend, twists and distort in weird ways.    Imagine you were standing on the center of a trampoline.  You represent a heavy mass (like a planet or star) and the fabric of the trampoline is spacetime.  By standing on the trampoline you (the mass) create a DISTORTION or WARP in spacetime.  If I were to place a basketball on the edge of the trampoline what would happen?  Correct, the ball would ROLL TOWARD YOU, right?    *THAT* is what GRAVITY really is - a DISTORTION of spacetime.    A black hole takes this case to the extreme.  Imagine that you became SOOOOOO fat that you RIPPED THROUGH the trampoline fabric.  IN that case ANYTHING that you put onto the trampoline surface would *ALWAYS* and *INEVITABLY* roll into the hole and forever be lost.      THAT'S WHAT A BLACK HOLE IS - a TEAR in spacetime.    I hope that helps.

LLcUNIxTaa	Fear not, your understanding is correct on drift speed.  However, when voltage (AC or DC) is applied the electrons closest to the voltage source are pushed, they bump into the ones next to them, those bump the ones next to them, so on and so on.  So current flow seems instantaneous all along the conductor.    Good practical example is a tube full of marbles.  Since they are side by side, pushing on one at one end, creates movement at the other end almost instantaneously.    The nicely ordered crystalline structure of metal helps make this happen.    Good question.    Mr. B|`|CY495kiYaa	Light bulbs run on AC (alternating current).  In DC (direct current) electrons flows over the length of the wire, from the point of origin to the point of termination.    But with AC the electrons don't move far - they just push their neighbors.  Imagine being in a crowded room PACKED full of people.  If you shove one person they will bump into the next person who bumps into the next and so on - transferring the effect across the room.      Likewise electrons on AC systems do not move much or very fast - they need only "bump" their neighbors to transfer the charge.    I hope that helps.

AA10391664	These are the two broadest classification of bacteria. A gram positive will be blue colored and a gram negative will be red when viewed under the microscope.  Pathogens and naturally occurring flora can be either gram + or gram -, so its not diagnostic of anything.|`|n776D1j6aa	Gram-negative bacteria are those bacteria that do not retain crystal violet dye in the Gram staining protocol.[1] Gram-positive bacteria will retain the crystal violet dye when washed in a decolorizing solution. In a Gram stain test, a counterstain (commonly safranin) is added after the crystal violet, coloring all Gram-negative bacteria a red or pink color. The test itself is useful in classifying two distinct types of bacteria based on structural differences in their cell walls.    Many species of Gram-negative bacteria are pathogenic, meaning they can cause disease in a host organism. This pathogenic capability is usually associated with certain components of Gram-negative cell walls, in particular the lipopolysaccharide (also known as LPS or endotoxin) layer.[1] In humans, LPS triggers an innate immune response characterized by cytokine production and immune system activation. Inflammation is a common result of cytokine production, which can also produce host toxicity.    The following characteristics are displayed by Gram-negative bacteria:    Cytoplasmic membrane   Thin peptidoglycan layer (which is present in much higher levels in Gram-positive bacteria)   Outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS, which consists of lipid A, core polysaccharide, and O antigen) outside the peptidoglycan layer   Porins exist in the outer membrane, which act like pores for particular molecules   There is a space between the layers of peptidoglycan and the secondary cell membrane called the periplasmic space   The S-layer is directly attached to the outer membrane, rather than the peptidoglycan   If present, flagella have four supporting rings instead of two   No teichoic acids or lipoteichoic acids are present   Lipoproteins are attached to the polysaccharide backbone.   Most do not sporulate (Coxiella burnetti, which produces spore-like structures, is a notable exception)     Example species  The proteobacteria are a major group of Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella,and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Helicobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Bdellovibrio, acetic acid bacteria, Legionella and alpha-proteobacteria as Wolbachia and many others. Other notable groups of Gram-negative bacteria include the cyanobacteria, spirochaetes, green sulfur and green non-sulfur bacteria.    Medically relevant Gram-negative cocci include three organisms, which cause a sexually transmitted disease (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), a meningitis (Neisseria meningitidis), and respiratory symptoms (Moraxella catarrhalis).    Medically relevant Gram-negative bacilli include a multitude of species. Some of them primarily cause respiratory problems (Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), primarily urinary problems (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens), and primarily gastrointestinal problems (Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhi).    Gram negative bacteria associated with nosocomial infections include Acinetobacter baumanii, which cause bacteremia, secondary meningitis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units of hospital establishments.      Medical treatment  One of the several unique characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria is the structure of the outer membrane. The outer leaflet of the membrane comprises a complex lipopolysaccharide whose lipid portion acts as an endotoxin. If endotoxin enters the circulatory system it causes a toxic reaction with the sufferer having a high temperature and respiration rate and a low blood pressure. This may lead to endotoxic shock, which may be fatal.    This outer membrane protects the bacteria from several antibiotics, dyes, and detergents which would normally damage the inner membrane or cell wall (peptidoglycan). The outer membrane provides these bacteria with resistance to lysozyme and penicillin. Fortunately, alternative medicinal treatments such as lysozyme with EDTA, and the antibiotic ampicillin have been developed to combat the protective outer membrane of some pathogenic Gram-negative organisms. Other drugs can be used, namely chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and nalidixic acid.

The much larger llama is easily distinguished by its banana-shaped ears, impending size, and coarser fiber. (Photo by Jennifer Clark)   Many people are confused about the differences between alpacas and llamas. The photo below of an adult llama and an adult suri alpaca should clear up some of the confusion. The average llama is roughly twice the size of the average alpaca. There are differences in the body and head also, especially the shape of the ears.     While the alpaca has been carefully bred for over 6,000 years as a luxury fiber-producing animal, the llama was bred as a pack animal. Its purpose has traditionally been to carry packs in mountainous terrain. The llama has coarse guard hair which protects it's fine, inner coat of fleece from the chafing of the pack on its back.    Alpacas do not have guard hair in the prime fleece of this "blanket" area. Despite its much larger size, the llama produces far less fleece per animal than the alpaca. The llama shown here has not been shorn; the alpaca shown here was shorn a few months earlier. The fleece of the alpaca is so dense that the animals could not remain healthy in the heat of the summer with their fleeces unshorn.    The smaller, more readily handled alpaca has straight ears and a much softer fiber devoid of guard hairs. (Photo by Armstrong Studio)    In addition to its packing use, the llama makes a very good guard animal for alpacas, sheep and other small livestock. Llamas and alpacas can interbreed and produce live, fertile offspring, but this offspring would not be either as strong as a true llama nor have as lovely a fleece as a true alpaca, so this "intermediate" animal would not be very useful. New research has confirmed that, while the alpaca was bred by the Incas out of a Vicuna ancestor, the llama was bred by the Incas from a Guanaco ancestor. All four of these animals are members of the camel family, but the rare and endangered Vicuna is famous as the animal with the finest fleece in the world.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	They are related and similar but the alpaca is larger, has slightly longer hair, and has a smaller head. The alpaca has the superior fleece. Both are domestic animals derived from the wild guanaco|`|HyUE9ON0aa	FAQ about Llamas and Alpacas    Q: What's the difference between alpacas and llamas?  A: Size and fiber quality. Llamas were primarily bred to be a beast  of burden, and alpacas were bred primarily as fiber producers. An  average alpaca standing 34"-36" at the withers, where llamas stand  42"-48" at the withers. An adult alpaca will generally produce 5-8 s of  high quality exotic uniformly crimped fiber in a single fiber fleece,  each year.    @@@@@@    Q: Where do llamas & alpacas come from?  A: Llamas and alpacas come from Peru, Bolivia, and Chile, in the high  plains areas called the "Altiplano" (elevation: 8,000'-15,000' ). Llamas  were first brought to the United States by William Randolph Hearst in  the 1920's for his personal zoo.  Alpacas were imported much more  recently, beginning in the '80s. Llamas and alpacas were domesticated  from their wild counterparts, the Guanaco and Vicuna. 6,000-7,000 years  ago by the Quechua Indians and their fiber and structure were improved  by the Incas.    Q: What kind of personality do llamas have?  A: Llamas by nature, are very intelligent, gentle animals. They are  relatively inexpensive to maintain, relatively disease-free, and are  quick,to learn, cooperative, and patient in training. Their quickness to  learn can make them, at times, mischievous.    Q: Do they spit?  A: Yes, they do spit, but usually at each other.  This being over  disputes about food primarily.  A bred female llama will spit at  advances from a male llama.  An over-handled llama, improperly  socialized without other llamas present, will think humans are  llamas and will spit as a normal course of action against the other  "llama".  A mistreated or mishandled llama, may also spit at humans.    Q: What do you do with a llama?  A:There are seven main uses for a llama, many compatible in the same  animal.    *A pet and companion  *A sure-footed, alert pack animal  *A source of excellent fiber (similar to alpaca)  *An animal trained to pull a cart  *A show competitor: 4-H Projects, parades  *A competent guard animal, very effective against small predators  *A breeding animal, as a source of income    Q: What's the difference between alpacas and llamas?  A: Size and fiber quality.  Llamas were primarily bred to be a beast  of burden, and alpacas were bred primarily as fiber producers.  An  average alpaca standing 34"-36" at the withers, where llamas stand  42"-48" at the withers.  An adult alpaca will generally produce 5-8 s of  high quality exotic uniformly crimped fiber in a single fiber fleece,  each year.    Q: Do llamas produce fiber of high quality?  How much do they produce?  A: Llamas are excellent fiber producers too. They usually have a dual  fiber fleece, however, which includes 80-100% fine crimpy fluff and  20-0% straight coarse guard hair. The fiber is hollow, making it  excellent for creating warm clothing. It is also oil free and has no  inherent odor. The qualities make this fiber a spinner's dream, and it  may be felted as well. The amount of fiber varies from animal to  animal, but an average is about 2-5 s per year.  Most llamas would  need shearing every other year, some every year, and some every third  year.    Q: Can you ride them?  A: It is not generally recommended to ride llamas, except for small  children.  An adult male will reach a weight of between 300 and 450  lbs. and stand 5 to 6 feet tall. They are expected to carry  approximately 1/4 of their body weight, so a rider or load of between  75-115 lbs. may be carried. This weight may be increased to a maximum of  1/3 of their body weight as they reach top physical conditioning.    Q: Can you take them back-packing?  A: Llamas are great friends to have when you want to head to the high  country for a little camping and back-country trekking. Because of their  soft foot (two toes, with toenails) they leave no scars on the trail.  Because they are modified ruminants, their fecal matter comes as very  well digested, almost odorless pellets. They can usually browse for  their food as they go along the trail. All in all, they fit into the  mountain trail or back-country environment very well.    Q: How much space do they need?  A: Llamas can be maintained in a backyard, however, it is best that  they have a good sized area.  Llamas are very athletic and like to run  and play.  This could be an acre or two.  Llamas are efficient  digesters and usually one horse will graze about as much a 5-7 llamas.  They can easily jump most fences, but train to fences as youngsters and  usually don't jump.  A minimum 4' high stock fence is recommended for  protection against feral dogs.    Q: Do they bite or kick?  A: They do not bite or kick like a horse.  A human isn't in danger of  being kicked or bitten by a properly socialized and desensitized  animal.  They will kick at a fly or something around their back feet,  but because the foot is soft it's just not as dangerous as a horse's  kick and isn't used as a primary self-defense measure.

They are swift flyers.  They are protected in the United States. It has a wingspan of over 3 feet, weigh from 6.6 to 16 punds.  They build large nests, that can sometimes be 13 feet deep, they use the same nest year after year making improvements as needed. They are found in close proximaty of water. They have a diet that consist of  rabbits, hares, raccoons, muskrats, beavers, sea otters, and deer fawns. Preferred avian prey includes grebes, alcids, ducks, gulls, coots, egrets and geese.  Reptiles, amphibians and crustaceans are also on the menu.

gOOxQKNAaa	That means find the inverse of the function f(x). Plugging the inverse of a function into the original function will cancel it out to x.    f( f^-1(x) ) = x    For example,  f(x) = x^2    The inverse of that function is sqrt(x). When you plug in sqrt(x) to the original function (x^2), it cancels out it x.    So, to find the inverse your function, sqrt( x - 2 ),    1. Set that equal to y.    y = sqrt( x - 2 )    2. Switch y and x.    x = sqrt( y - 2 )    3. Solve for y.    x = sqrt( y - 2 )  x^2 = y - 2  y = x^2 + 2      4. Just for kicks and giggles, let's check by plugging that into the original equation to see if it cancels it out:    f(x) = sqrt( x - 2 )    f^-1(x) = x^2 + 2    f( f^-1(x) ) = sqrt( (x^2 + 2) - 2)  f( f^-1(x) ) = sqrt( x^2 )  f( f^-1(x) ) = x  Yay, it works!    Therefore, f^-1(x) of f(x) is:  y = x^2 + 2    Hope that helped!    Note: It's a common misconception to think that f^-1(x) means "f(x) to the power of -1". No!! It's just the notation for "inverse of f(x)".

e1b7fa175ee86774c026fbd4b9b163a4aa	well by definition, oxidation is defined as the increase in the oxidation state of a species, when a species lose electrons or lose hydrogen...  reduction is the gain of hydrogen,gain of electron and decrease in oxidation state(O.S)...  NB when an element is in the uncombined state, like Mg, Zn, I2, O.S =0    a)  oxidation state of Co in Co2+ is +2  in Co it is 0...there has been a decrease therefore it is a reduction...  b)  O.S change from -1 to 0, it is an oxidation  c)  decrease from +3 to +2==reduction  d)2+ to 4+===oxidation    2) oxidizing agent is one which gets reduced in a reduction...it oxidizes the other substance and get itself reduced...and the contrary is the case(for reducing agent)  3)when number of element on both side should be balance and the charge also should be balance..usually to balance charges, we add electrons or H+ ion...  first balance the number of element and then the charge at the end  hope this helps=)|`|j81AASLZaa	Well if it is oxidized, the oxidation number of the element/ion/etc will increase while reductions will cause a decrease in oxidation numbers. The charges on the element in these ions would be its oxidation number. Since Co2+ becomes Co (any along element has an ox   of 0) so it went form+2 to 0 = decrease therefore reduction. And so on and so forth    2. Oxidizing agents DO the oxidizing on the other ion (so they are the ones that reduce)  3.

vmu2LlzMaa	Viruses reproduce by using the host cell's replication mechanisms to make copies of itself. A virus consists of a protein coat and nucleic acid, which can be single-stranded or double-stranded RNA or DNA.    Bacteria reproduce by budding, but can genetic exchange can occur via transformation (absorbing loose DNA), conjugation (bacterial sex), or transduction (infection by a transducing phage). A bacterium has a single circular chromosome, but may also have one or more plasmids with extra non-essential genes on it (this is what is transferred during conjugation). There is no nucleus, only a nucleoid region. And there are no organelles.    Human somatic cells reproduce via mitosis. They have a nucleus and organelles (dependent on what type of cell they are). Human cells contain 46 linear chromosomes.

07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	It has three electrodes. A large current can pass through it from the cathode to the anode with very little resistance but only if the SCR is turned on. What controls whether that SCR is turned on is whether there is a small voltage letting a current flow into the third electrode - the gate. When that gate is on its tiny current flow permits the large flow passing though the other two electrodes for the load.    That makes the SCR a solid state switch in which the switch is flipped on/off by the gate so the switch can control a large current for a load.|`|yxnUBSJqaa	SCR power controllers or silicon controlled rectifier power controllers precisely regulate output power to resistive heating loads such as industrial furnaces and ovens. They can be interfaced with computers and software that can monitor and/or control power throughput. The two primary modes of SCR control are:  Phase Angle: Controller allows partial waveform through during every half-wave cycle.  Zero-Crossing: Controller allows proportion of complete half-waves through to regulate power.   Important operating specifications for SCR power controllers include the phase, operating voltage, and maximum current.  Phase choices for SCR power controllers include single phase, three phase 2-leg, and three phase 3-leg.  Operating voltages for SCR power controllers include  500 VAC.  The maximum current is the maximum rated current of the SCR power controller.  Operating features to consider when specifying SCR power controllers include command signals, control feedback, diagnostic indicators, soft start, and failure detection or alarm.  Command signal choices include analog voltage, analog current, and potentiometers.  With an analog voltage command signal the output of the controller is regulated by varying an analog input voltage signal.  With an analog current command signal the output of controller is regulated by varying an analog input current signal.  The output of controller can be  regulated by varying a potentiometer, often in the form of a dial on the front panel.  Control feedback choices are voltage, current, or power.  Diagnostic indicators are visual indicators during ON condition (needles, LEDs, etc.)  A soft start provides for a gradual ramp-up of output for load protection.  Failure detection or alarm uses circuitry that detects failures such as short circuits or missing cycles and provides interlock signal or audible alarm.  Mounting choices for SCR power controllers include open panel, enclosed wall mount, rack mount, DIN rail, and freestanding or cabinet.  Open panel SCR power controllers are wall-mounted with open, accessible electrical components.  In an enclosed wall mount an enclosure is provided along with mounting holes on the enclosure.  A rack mount unit is designed to be mounted in a rack assembly.  A DIN rail mounted unit is designed for mounting on a standard DIN Rail.  Freestanding or cabinet units stand on the floor or are integrally mounted in the cabinet.  An important environmental operating parameter to consider when specifying SCR power controllers is operating temperature.|`|r2gybx5haa	google it

Gmvldblraa	You have to know something about the time. Its a velocity - its got time in it - it has to be somewhere in any equation.    Velocity = Distance / Time taken to go the distance    In the special case of going round in a circle.    If d = 2 . pi . r  then we say that T is the period, the time taken to go round once.    and V = 2 . pi . r / T   or   c / T   (since c =2 . pi . r )    no good because you don't have T? Do you have "f" the frequency - the number of times per second that something is going round the circle?    Because f = 1/T    So  V = 2 . pi . r . f  which is a common way to write it .           =   c . f   (if you prefer )    Also w,(called omega) standing  for  angular velocity        V = w . r     w = 2 . pi . f    So its all just moving the symbols around. You have to have the time, either as the period, or as the frequency. There's no other way to get equations for velocity.

74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	Easy,    Impulse dP = F dt; so that F = dP/dt.  The impact velocity V must slow to zero.  That is, dP will be the same no matter what we wrap or do not wrap around the egg.      So to reduce the force F on the egg and clearly reduce the likelihood of breaking, we must lengthen the time to halt dt.  By causing your index card to crumple on impact it absorbs the energy and takes some protected time dT > dt, which is the unprotected egg time, to reach V = 0.     In which case f = dP/dT     Clearly, to make this work, you need to fashion your index card in such a way that it has the maximum crumple capability; so as to lengthen that impact time.  Note this is the basis for having crumple hoods in cars; they increase the time to go from V > 0 to V = 0 and thereby reduce the forces acting on the passengers.

An overdose of aspirin means you have too much aspirin in your body.    This can happen in two ways:    If a person accidentally or intentionally takes a very large dose of aspirin at one time, it's called an acute overdose.    If a normal daily dose of aspirin builds up in the body over time and causes symptoms, it's called a chronic overdose. This may happen if your kidneys do not work correctly or when you are dehydrated. Chronic overdoses are usually seen in older patients during hot weather.

DRVSCxKpaa	People often have trouble with this.  An empirical formula expresses the elements present in their simplest ratio. In your example, You know the % composition, but you have to take into account the atomic masses of the elements.    For example, in water, an H2O molecule will contain 2xH and 1xO in its formula (which in this case is also its empirical formula); but will contain 2xH and 16xO by mass; because of the atomic masses of hydrogen (1) and oxygen (16).  The mass percentage of O in H2O is therefore 16/(16+2)*100 = 16/18*100 = 89%.  Note that the % O is 89%; but there is only one O to 2 H in the molecule.    Therefore, to work out the empirical formula, you have to divide the percentage present by the atomic masses. The resulting numbers will be close to a whole number ratio.  This is the molecular ratio. Divide one by the other, and you'll come up closest to a whole number, which gives you the empirical formula.    In your example, 67.61/238.13 = 0.2839; and 32.39/19.00 = 1.7047  1.7047/0.2829 = 6.0046; close to 6  Therefore, the empirical formula = UF6; uranium hexaflouride.

That is why the nomad life was the traditional life of the Somali people since it was the most productive way of making a living.

Soil organic matter is low, therefore it is low in fertility. Thus production per unit land is low.    This exposes the farmers to high risks.  Typically all over in the developing / under-developed countries, farmers do not get returns that justify their inputs and risks.  This is the main technical reason for poverty and hunger in this region.    Under the same geo-climate,  a European farmers - for example - purchases large chunks of land and take up farming activity successfully and profitably.

G5nSzRJqaa	Here are some theories:    1. The Big Bang Theory: Le Maitre and Gammow proposed this theory. According to this theory, at the beginning of the universe, the whole matter of the universe was once concentrated in an extremely dense and hot (~10 12K) fireball. Then about 20 billion years ago a vast explosion (big bang) occurred. The matter was broken into pieces, which were thrown out with high speed in all directions forming stars and galaxies; which are still moving way from one another. According to Hubble's law, the velocity of recession of a galaxy becomes equal to the velocity of light at a distance equal of 20 billing light years. It means, the light rays from stars and galaxies, which are situated at a distance of 20 billion light years or more, can never reach us. Thus this distance becomes the boundary of observable universe. On account of continuous recession, more and more galaxies will go beyond this boundary and the will be lost. As a result of this, the number of galaxies per unit volume will go on decreasing and ultimately a time may come when we may have empty universe.    2. Steady State Theory: Bondi, Gold and Fred Hoyle developed this theory. According to this theory, the number of galaxies in the observable universe is constant and new galaxies are continuously being created out of empty space, which fill up the gaps caused by those galaxies, which have crossed the boundary of the observable universe. As a result of it, the overall size of mass of the observable universe remains constant. Thus a steady state of the universe is not disturbed at all.    3. Pulsating Theory: According to this theory, the universe is supposed to be expanding and contracting alternately i.e. pulsating. At present, the universe is expanding. According to pulsating theory, it is possible that at a certain time, the expansion of the universe may be stopped by the gravitational pull and the may contract again. After it has been contracted to a certain size, explosion again occurs and the universe will start expanding. The alternate expansion and contraction of the universe give rise to pulsating universe.|`|LhvLMsyWaa	i believe that the Lord created the universe like in Genesis chapter 1 in the holy bible he spent 6 days creating the universe and everything in it and then on the 7th he rested  and i think that it goes on forever and never ends|`|62b4b4e43dbbc19be869b507637ba885aa	if u don't follow up physics and just think about the universe then you may end up saying physics or astronomy is crazy , this cannot be true or this cannot be happening.

d014f113fb3eecfed19b0fbba5d885d9aa	I have taken both and would say Trig is harder.  However, given that you have some work experience, you should find either of these a lot easier, especially if you can relate the topic to something that you either do or have done in your work life.    Example:     If you work with drywall or paneling, then Trig might be very easy as you are working with angles of how to cut the material to use in construction.    If you have worked in a manufacturing organization, then Stats should be easier, especially if you have worked with something called Six Sigma.    So I would suggest taking the class that will give you the greatest pleasure or usual potential in your daily work.  That will allow you to actually use the topic as you work and allow for better understanding.    Another thought would be to network with people who use these topics on a daily basis.  The stats could be either the American Society or Quality or the American Statistical Association.    For Trig - go to the library in the reference section and find a set of books called the Encyclopedia of Associations.

2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	The only source of light from the moon is reflected sunlight.    The reason the moon looks so bright is there is nothing else bright in   the sky to compete with it.  At night, the amount of light we see is too low to allow our daytime colour "cones" to function, so our eyes switch over to the low-light-sensitive "rods" to see.  But the moon is brighter than the rods are designed for and the moon seems to burn out our night vision - we interpret that as "bright".    But the moon actually only reflects about 7% of the sunlight that hits it.  And if you look at the full moon in a good pair of binoculars or a telescope, let your eyes adapt to the brightness - your colour-sensitive cones will activate and you may be able to see subtle colours on the moon (not just white, grey, and black).  Believe it or not, the moon has gold, turquoise, mauve, and other tones (just very faint) if you look for them.|`|f1beDbKIaa	No.    In fact, the Moon is as bright as tar.  It doesn't even reflect much sunlight.|`|gUWcvxzuaa	It's made of luminous green cheese..?|`|92uZ02Xpaa	There is either not another scientific fact about it or I don't know about it.|`|LhvLMsyWaa	no   its kinda like a mirror|`|KHjYq2bHaa	One of the above responses have a right answer. The one that mentioned low reflectivity is talking about albedo. It is the percentage of light reflect per total light received. A body with an albedo of 1.00 is a perfect reflecter, like a mirror. Black objects are close to 0.00. The moon has a really low albedo surprisingly, but since there is so much sunlight, it appears bright especially during full moon.    There's some light produced from Earth from artificial lights, and some reflected sunlight of the Earth reaching the Moon, but only a negligible contribution.
ujomB7iHaa	This is a story my 8th grade science teacher told me    He was born in the town of Syrancuse, on the island of Sicily, in about 287 BC. Hiero II, the ruler of Syracuse, had a fantastic crown of gold made for him-self. But Hiero did not trust the goldsmith who made the crown. After it was made he wanted to make sure it was pure gold, and not alloyed (mixed) with silver by the goldsmith. Hiero asked Archimedes to find out with-out destroying the beautiful crown. At first Archimeds was confused by the problem. Then one day while he was at the bath, he had noticed that the water level rose as he got in. When he got out the water level went down. Instanly he realized how to solve the kings problem.He was so excited that he ran home naked through the streets of syrancuse shouting "Eureka, Eureka" which is Greek for "I have found it."       so basically  because a liquid has a certain weight to it, it exerts pressure on the sides of the container it's in, as we add objects to the container of water, they must make room for themselves, which envolves the pushing away and therefore moving of water.     as this water is moving around, it is pushing against the sides of the container, and because the container is strong enough to keep it's form while objects are being placed inside it, The water level that we see by looking at the container rises.     the Archemedes principal is present not just in scientific experiments, but in our everyday lives as well, when we step into the bathtub, when we add ice to our drink, and even when we add carrots to a pot of boiling water.|`|f43ec9175e6ff594263397529d524231aa	I know it's wikipedia but I thought they gave a simple but through explanation.

dYnpK0k4aa	With respect,  methane has no smell.   What you are smelling cannot be methane.    Methane has a lower explosive limit of 5%.   This means that if the concentration of methane in the atmosphere becomes 5% in air,  it will explode.   Testing that with a candle would be incredibly foolish and dangerous.   It readily could explode.    Methane is a suffocating gas,  meaning that it is not toxic per se but rather drives out the oxygen and will suffocate you.    Note also that methane is lighter than air.   This means that methane in a cave would collect in pockets in the ceiling of the cave and be explosive even if in most of the cave the concentration of methane was less than 5%.    In some caves,  one finds SO2 rather than CO.   SO2 is another suffocating gas but also can be toxic and quite acidifying.   I am not a caver but I would suggest that unless you have appropriate testing equipment and breathing apparatus,  don't think about trying it.   There are just too many ways to get in trouble and if you do and are overcome,  without help,  you're unconscious and quickly die.

AA12139405	Earthquakes can not be predicted but can be suspected.  PROTECTION DURING EARTHQUAKES    The following are some of the important precaution to be observed to save our life during an earthquake. Even though we do not have fool proof system to fore warn earthquakes some of the changes in nature or in the behaviors of animals and birds may help to decide the situations.    Before an earthquake.  Have a battery powered radio, flash light, and first aid kids in your house ,  Make sure every one knows where they are kept ,  Learn first aid; teach how to stop electric main and gas supply ,  Dont keep heavy objects in high shelves ,  Fasten heavy appliances to the floor, and anchor heavy furniture to the walls ,  Plan for your family for reuniting after an earthquake if anybody separated ,  Urge your school teachers to discuss earthquake safety in the class rooms, and ask them to conduct drills ,Keep some dry fruits and drinking water.   Find out your office has an emergency plan, know your responsibility at your works during an emergency .Keep some dry fruits and drinking water .    During an earthquake.  Stay calm if you are indoors, stay out if you are out of buildings. Many injuries occur as people enter or leave the buildings.  If you are indoors , stand against the a wall near the center of the building, or get under a sturdy table  keep some cushion on your head, Stay away from windows and outside doors, if you are in a high rise building stand against a support column.  If you are in outdoor  stay in the open place , keep away from over head electric wires. and bridges,  Dont use open flames, if you are in a moving vehicle stop away from over bridges and stay inside the vehicle still earthquake stops.    After an earthquake.  Check yourself and nearby people for injury, provide first aid,  Check electric and gas connection,  Turn on your radio or T.V for emergency instructions, reduce the use of phone lines it may be required for conveying some important messages.  Stay out of damaged buildings,  Wear chapels and gloves to protect against shattered glass and debris.     Stay away from beaches and water front areas where Tsunami could strike, even long after the shaking has stopped.  Have one earthquake alarm fixed in your house.

YAttCSf2aa	It's what's know as climotolorgy.    While the last few years have been warmer than usual, and people are screaming global warming, 30 years ago people we're talling of the coming ICE AGE.     What causes this?    Part of it is the fact that measurements of tempratures have gotten more accurate (measuring the absoulte high with automated weather stations, instead of the high, when temps. are taken once per hour)  which kind of debunks the whole global warming theory. (personally, I believe there is a little, but not to Al gore's "we're gonna die in 5 years" theory)    so it's not global warming. obviously.    which basically means that we're been in a generally warm pattern the last few years (warmer than average)...and to have an average, you have to have some years where the temps. are below average, and this could just be one of them.|`|OlOaoLD2aa	people keep  leaving their fan on and the refrigerators open....go figure..|`|kzkrll3Xaa	butterfly flapped its wings in china|`|FjwdmI0oaa	Al Gore said it is global warming !!

SYSCiRhsaa	No, that's totally wrong.  Using the 5 kingdom system, Monera would be on a branch on its own.  The Monerans, or prokaryotes, are single celled organisms whose DNA is not contained in a membrane-bound nucleus.  In all of the other kingdoms cells contain a nucleus surrounded by its own membrane which holds the entire genome (all of the DNA).    You could represent Monera at the bottom of the tree with all other kingdoms coming up from it, sort of like this:    http://www.southtexascollege.edu/nilsson...    Here's another example:    http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Scie...    This one shows the split between Archaea and Eubacteria, but since your teacher isn't having you learn that I would just ignore it for now.  Just know that modern cellular and genetic analysis tells us that all prokaryotes are not as closely related as we once thought and that there is huge diversity among them.  Under the old 5 kingdom system, Archaea and Bacteria are combined under Monera.    Here is another one that is sort of similar:    http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/biol...    It shows the more modern three domain system (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya) but also divides them up into kingdoms.  Again it separates the monerans but you could combine them in your depiction:    http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/biol...    Below are some other examples.  I hope these give you some ideas.  You can see that there are several different ways to represent the same idea.  Some are more complex and detailed than others, but you can see the basic idea.    http://plantphys.info/organismal/lechtml...    http://www.nasivvik.com/images/div-tree_...    http://evolution-textbook.org/content/fr...    http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/education/e...

l2BjWA5Baa	Let's start by simplifying the right side: x + 3 + 4 = x + 7. Okay.     When you graph an equation, it's easiest if it's in y = mx+b form, so let's divide it all by -2 as well. Remember, though, that when you divide an inequality by a negative number, you have to flip the sign! So now we have    y => -x/2 - 3.5    When graphing an inequality, first graph it as if it were an equal sign instead. (if you don't already know how to graph linear equations, ask your teacher or email me!) Graph y = -x/2 - 3.5    Now because it's an inequality, there are many more possible answers than there would be if it were just the equal sign. So since (in our transformed equation) it's greater than, you're going to shade everything above (or greater than) the line!

You must be sponsored by some sort of academic body that will award you your PhD if they believe you deserve it.  Whether or not you deserve it has a lot to do with the relevance of your research.  So you need both a book based on relavent research and an academic institution willing to stake its reputation on that work.  This may be difficult to accomplish considering the dearth of significant research--not to mention academic departments--in the field of parapsychology.    Your best bet is probably to earn a PhD in psychology and then choose parapsychology as your area of concentration.  This career route is usually based in lab research rather than clinical practice.|`|mjrLWAbXaa	Many parapsychologist hold PhD degrees in psychology from the University of Edinburgh.

So rewrite x^2-25 to (x-5)(x+5). In order to get a common denominator simply multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction 3/x+5 by x-5    You then get 3(x-5)/(x-5)(x+5)... multiply the numerator out and you get 3x-15/(x-5)(x+5)    Now you have a common denominator so combine both fractions... you get    x^2-x+3x-15/(x-5)(x+5)    Final answer is... x^2+2x-15/(x-5)(x+5) which can be reduced to x-3/x-5|`|oFtVXmz4aa	You should put some () so I understand the expressions|`|7qpQSk0Paa	I added () where I guessed they should be.  1) (3x+2)/(x-2) - (x+5)/(x-2)  they have the same denominator so we add the numerators  (4x +7) / ( x-2)      2) (x^2-x)/(x^2-25) + 3/(x+5)    common denominator is (x+5)(x-5)    ((x^2 - x) + 3(x-5) ) /( (x+5)(x-5) =  (x^2 -x + 3x - 15) /((x+5)(x-5)) =  (x^2 + 2x - 15) /((x+5)(x-5))  (x +5)(x -3) /((x+5)(x-5))  (x-3) / (x-5)
921fd3e5c127d3dd26ff9bd25b494b9aaa	The individual tall cylinders that you see on the farm are built to hold corn silage. or other types of grass silage. It is a bulky feed and needs a lot of space to store it. Corn is chopped green ,the stalks, leaves,grain, cob and all, and blown into the silos. The corn starts to ferment and spoil until all of the available air is used up. The anaerobic bacteria create acids until all of the bacteria are killed and the feed is preserved.Very much like cabbage is preserved as sour-crout . It is important that the structures are round to eliminate any air pockets as that would cause spoilage. They must be tall so the chopped corn is packed tightly for the same reason.|`|1l8KBXsbaa	They are built in that shape for two reasons.    1. Crops are generally very heavy and a cylinder maximizes the strength of the material the walls are made of.    2. Cylinders hold a greater volume per square foot of wall than most other shapes (squares built using the same amount of material hold less because of corners)|`|0L2wWANcaa	they are made to hold silage but the government wanted them to be that shape in the cold war era so we could conceal all of our missiles around the country to avoid detection by the commies|`|61d7657e19812b9e24725afba39d8111aa	strength might be the reason not sure, but I think that the reason is for easy cleanout. cribs were mostly in rectangles and they held together but all bins I have seen are round and on the floor you put an auger 1/2 the diameter of the bin called a sweep and you push it around the bin and it takes the grain to the center of the bin and it cleans the bin with the least work.|`|gVP3NghHaa	its a cylinder because it means less land you use to build it, and it is stronger than a lot of other shapes. also enough room to hold corn or grain, whatever.|`|iTetA3oCaa	All silos are not tall cylinders.  Some are piles above the ground and some are trench's in the ground.  Upright silos, such as you are talking about are losing favor because they hold relatively little feed and with today's larger operations it takes a lot of them to store feed.  Recently silage has been forced into large plastic bags laying on the ground.  These provide good storage also.|`|O9FojdEMaa	silos are used to store grain or silage and it is the best shape to allow all the contents to be removed without a lot  of extra work|`|2CBxqNcaaa	the cylindrical, or tube shape has an extremely higher strength to wall ratio than other shapes.|`|1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	It's structurally the most efficient way to store harvested grain.  It's round like a pipe because it eliminates any bending stresses, so that only tensile stresses are involved.  Having multiple tall and narrow "pipe" towers rather than a single tall but wide round tower requires less wall thickness, and are less likely to fail structurally.
jSPj3S6faa	The universe is not infinite in the conventional sense.  It is infinite because we cannot experience an end to our universe.      The closest analogy to this concept is to consider an ant crawling on the surface of a ball the size of a hot air balloon.  No matter how far the ant goes, he never finds an end to the surface.  In this sense, the ball's surface is infinite EVEN THOUGH one can easily see that there is a fixed amount of area of the ball's surface.    This analogy cannot be applied completely to our universe as science is of the present opinion that our universe is not curved in the next higher dimension as is the surface of the ball.  (That is, the two-dimensional surface of the ball is curved positively in the next higher dimension, the third dimension.)    Yet the concept that we cannot experience an end to our universe which thus defines our universe as infinite must apply to our "flat in the fourth-spatial-dimension" universe.    Meanwhile, if we were to take the ball's surface off of the ball and flatten it out, its limits should be obvious to the ant.  It is at this particular point that the analogy falls apart.  We need a better analogy that matches the facts.    The fact is that when viewed from a higher spatial dimension, our universe would have a boundary.  It would be finite and it is finite.  Thus it can get bigger (expand) and yet be infinite; when you realize that infinite actually means "without end."  And that due to the nature of our existence, we cannot experience the end of the universe.|`|AA11538887	Astronomers do not claim the universe is infinite.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	No one said it is infinite.|`|V92XxThoaa	It isn't infinite.

UFteXlqwaa	As a private pilot, I use my thumb rule: 100 - ((temp - dew) * 5) = relative humidity. But that is using Celsius and while you don't tell, I guess you are talking about Fahrenheit.     Say, if the temperature was 20 C and dew point was 16 C, the spread (difference between the two) would be 4 and the relative humidity would be: 100 - (4*5) = 80 percent.    But in your case, even in Fahrenheit, the spread is only one degree and the relative humidity is then pretty close to 100 percent. So, answer D should be the closest.|`|AsKWImpQaa	You would look the temperature and dewpoint combination up in a table, or use a fairly complicated formula. Since the temperature is so close to the dewpoint, it is close to 100% (the temperature and dewpoint would be equal for 100% humidity).    Here is an online calculator you could use too:    http://www.ringbell.co.uk/info/humid.htm
j81AASLZaa	Due to the weak intermolecular forces holding the molecules together, it is easy to break those bonds without adding too much heat, so BP is low....strong intermolecular forces requires more heat to break the strong bonds so BP is higher.
Gmvldblraa	The question is loosely worded. Is the spring fixed by being clamped down at both ends, or is it just hanging free?  The speed of waves in a spring depend only on the tension in the spring and on the mass  per unit length of the spring.  Stretch the spring a bit and you will both increase the tension and reduce the  mass per  unit length - both will act to increase the wave speed. We used to change the  wave speed in springs by attaching to each coil of the spring, small lead weights ( used as fishing line sinkers), so the mass per  unit length was increased and the wave speed was slowed.    Frequency ?? You just change how fast you vibrate it. Or are you thinking of the resonant frequency of a fixed length spring? You have to be clear in your questions.  If it is the resonant frequency you want to change, then.... change the tension ( greater tension means higher resonant frequency), change the mass per  unit length of the spring ( greater mass means lower resonant frequency), change the length ( shorter length means higher resonant frequency), damp out selected harmonics ( usually results in higher resonant frequencies.)

AA10369461	Time does not appear to slow down it really does and we have proved that it does. They have placed an atomic clock on the shuttle which travels at 17,000 miles per hour, really slow compared to the speed of light, but the fastest thing we have available. The atomic clock on the shuttle and a twin was left on earth set at exactly the same time. After the shuttle had made it's voyage the clocks were checked again and found to differ by a tiny span of time.     The example of watching the clock read differntly while you race away from it falls apart when you race back towards it and the clock still runs differently at exactlythe same difference.. The speed of light is a constant (E=MCsquared were E is energy, M is Mass and C is the Constant of the Speed of Light) so even when you are racing toward it it is traveling at the same speed relative to you.    Time slows with velocity which is part of the reason we can never attain the speed of light. Speed is the distance traveled over a given length of time. The faster you go the more time slows and the harder it is to go faster over a time span that has slowed down. Not only does time slow down but mass increases which means that you need more power to accelerate the mass. Soon you cannot carry enough power to accelerate the mass to the speed of light.    Part of the problem in understanding this part of the theory is that it is pure math supporting theoretical physics, most of which have been proved as truth by the way. They are still finding ways to prove Einstein's theories nearly one hundred years later. Not bad for an autistic man.    I hope this helps.|`|l9jPfPCFaa	Time does not change, but the perception of time by the traveler might. Light and time are seperate, and not connected.

PkTab7Sraa	Your asking for a lot man, usually a degree in engineering requires a higher gpa than most other degrees as it is very math heavy.  And under 20 thou?  The only thing that's even remotely possible would be to do a program from a 2 year community college where you take courses taught by professors from a 4 year college/university at the community college.  Its usually half the tuition of actually going and your degree doesn't say via community college, its the same diploma as someone who graduates from the actual college.  Only thing that sucks is that it's community college, so you don't get the college experience (dorms, frats, parties, big campus, etc.)  Good choice on engineering as a major btw, there's a pretty large demand for engineers, especially guys to work onsite as all the current engineers are being promoted to offices or just old.|`|w3CtqNUmaa	i am nor sure about gpa, but i go to North Dakota State University, and my tuition (not including room and board) is only about twelve thousand a year. i would go to http://www.ndsu.edu and check out gpa and sat score requirements.   good luck!|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	I agree on the community college but in some states, junior colleges often have pre-engineering courses that prepare students for transfer to 4 year institutions.  Check with a local college because in my state there are slots in the state college system reserved for JC transfers to enter the state college as juniors.  This requires good grades in the JC but the purpose of the JC pre-engineering curriculum is to get their students ready for transferring into the state college system.  Then if you get that far, check for grants and scholarships from the 4 year college if you are in need of assistance.

Kpnp9ryFaa	I am currently taking Physics C and Calc AB.  However, I had a full year of precalc.  then again, all of the calculus that you actually need for physics can be given to you in a really miniscule fraction of the time it takes to cover it in a math class.  In my school, Physics C is really meant for those taking BC calculus.  However, my Physics teacher had to teach us to take integrals before that BC kids did, so I rode on that and was fine.  Talk to the Physics C teacher and see if he will allow you to take his/her class along with AB.  What I did is I really just had a 1 hour tutoring session with a math teacher and he taught me all I needed to know about derivatives.      For instance, the calculus class will spend about two weeks on derivatives, spending a lot of time learning how they fundamentally work, and solving them in a certain way that can take over 10 minutes and half a sheet of paper for a nasty problem.  then you learn a couple "rules" for derivatives.  The problem that just took you over 10 minutes and a half a page can now be done in your head in five seconds with a little practice.  Integrals are similar.  A problem that can actually take 45 minutes and over a page can be done in fifteen or so seconds with a simple rule.   Once you learn those rules, you will be more or less fine, and eventually the math class with catch up.     I know I am repeating my self a lot, but in brief:    If you are a strong math and science student, there isn't a reason why you shouldn't take physics C if you are willing to put in a bit of extra work.  I would say go for it.    EDIT:  To be honest I don't really remember what I learned in Precalc, though it just might be assimilated now.  I go to a rather challenging private school and have a B+ in Physics.  One word of caution:  you will still have to learn the long way for math.  It will be part of your grade, so even if you can do your math in a practical way, you will do poorly in math of you can't do it the way the teacher wants.|`|qCBWlmnMaa	HEEEECKKK NO!!!!

A six-week summer course is not sufficient to get a full understanding of Pre-Calc.  If you struggle in Calculus, AP Physics C would be near impossible.  As basic knowledge of Calculus and a solid foundation in Algebra and Pre-Calculus would be expected in AP Physics C.    I think you would be better off taking Pre-Calculus and AP Physics B next year.

shVgCizBaa	How To Build A Wind Generator http://www.homemade-wind-generator.com/                       ----------------------Build a generator from a lawn-edger motor.http://theepicenter.com/tow02077.html---... generator http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2006/09...         home made generator   Once I bought a petrol engine of an old lawnmower on Ibazar (now Ebay) because I wanted to learn how a four-stroke engine worked. I took it apart, cleaned everything, placed new seals and finally mounted everything back together. But she would not start. After having taken my tools again and having put it together a second time, around two weeks later, she gave her old sound again. It was the first time I saw her spinning, and she did great!     Having done all this, I thought, why should I not build something useful with this piece of beautiful equipment? At first, I had the idea of making a powerful water pump with her, but because I could not find suitable parts, I changed my mind and decided to build an homemade electric generator.    For making my electric generator, I started with the engine that I already had. It is a Briggs & Stratton 3.5 HP with a vertical shaft of 7/8 inch (22.22 mm) diameter. Serial number: Model 92908  Type 1282 - 01  Code 82021605 (engine is from 1982!)     http://users.telenet.be/b0y/ -------------------I made a homemade generator.  clip this post email this post what is this?  see most clipped and recent clippings   Posted by mihi Southeast (My Page) on Wed, Oct 18, 06 at 22:45      I recently built a homemade generator. I decided it would be nice to have if we lose power and I want to keep the refrigerator and freezer going.   Here is how I did it:     1) I asked around and got an old lawnmower given to me. It was a Murray with a 4.5 horse Briggs engine. The handle was shot, the wheels were falling off, but I got the engine running good. I cleaned the air filter, which I don't think had ever been done, and changed the oil and sparkplug. It runs fine now.     2) I bought a steel plate for $25 from theepicenter.com. This plat has universal holes drilled for a lawnmower. It also has the mounting holes for the alternator I would need. I bolted the lawnmower engine to the plate. I took the blade off the lawnmower first though. I also used 3 washers between the plate and engine to lift it off the plate a bit. This was needed to insure it could get in "depth" alignment with the alternator, in other words so the shaft didn't stick down to far.     Also, the blade acts as fly-wheel weight, which you lose when you take it off. I've found the pulley and alternator bring enough weight to make it work OK though and start easy enough.     3) I put a pulley on the lawnmower crankshaft. This to run the belt that goes to the alternator. I also got this pulley from epicenter. Theirs is a very good quality one, better than what I saw at Northern Tool.     4) I picked up a GM alternator. You can get the model number needed at theepicenter to from some of the plans they have. I used the alternator where you have a switch in the circuitry so that you can switch on the alternator to charge the battery, or you can switch it off. You can pick-up used alternators at the car junkyard, about $25. Or you can get a newly rebuilt one for about $50 or so. You do need to understand the different types and how they hook-up, which is really very simple. theepicenter website gives a good description.     5) You have to bolt the alternator to the steel plate. I had to go to the hardware store to get the correct bolts and stuff for this. It was easily done though.     6) You have to get a belt to run between the engine pulley and the alternator pulley. I ended up getting one from theepicenter too, as it was about as cheap as anywhere else and I got the right belt. Read their info. to decide on the right belt to use. I put the belt on and tensioned it just by feel.     7) I had gotten some cables that would work to hook the alternator to the battery post of a 12V car battery that I had available to me. Tell the guys at the autopart store what you're doing, they have them. You can also get them from theepicenter too. In this system you have to have a battery because a car alternator needs to be attached to one when it is charging. But that's OK, I like having the battery because I can run small appliances without having to crank-up the engine.     8) Then I ran some wires and a couple of switches, which I got at the local auto parts store, to an inverter that I had ordered. I got a 1200 watt continuous inverter for $99 (and no shipping charge or tax!). You can get small 400 watt inverters for about $25 if you only need to power small stuff.     9) I didn't mentioned that I built a wooden frame for this all to set on. Its a hodgepodge of 2x4's I had laying around. But it does the job of holding the steel plate with engine and alternator, and battery|`|JN3EbbGVaa	At large hardware stores you can now buy a solar powered light.

3bPRIkbUaa	It really depends on the type of algae you're using because different algae have different habitats. Even within the same Division, there are different habitual frequencies between major classes. Green algae, for example, has three major classes within it -- the Chlorophyceae, the Ulvophyceae, and the Charopyceae. The Chlorophyceae and Charphyceae are found mostly in freshwater or on land, while the Ulvophyceae are found in marine water and on land. So honestly, it just depends on what type of algae you have, but putting it in any freshwater would be perfectly fine, especially cold water.    As for growing the algae, all you have to do is find a clean container, fill it up with your water and put your algal sample in the water.

b651a8c169b6d9487947e546de9a0530aa	Nuclear explosions trigger a horrendous chain reaction. The instantaneous outcome is the thermal and blast effect annihilating everything in and around the area. The mushrooming cloud due to the explosion rises high into the stratosphere, spreading out vast quantities of soot and radioactive debris. Some of the debris fall back to the ground as rain out. The soot and other particles suspended in the atmosphere would block sunlight and lower the global temperatures steeply to subzero levels, ushering in wintery conditions over the planet. This sequence of events has been termed as "Nuclear Winter". As a consequence, photosynthesis would stop leading to the destruction of all green plants.    Subsequently oxygen regeneration would cease and carbondioxide would accumulate. Earth's radiation balance and heat budget would get altered leading to drastic changes in the global circulation pattern. the seasonal monsoons and tropiacl rains may disappear. the duration and extent of the nuclear winter scenario would depend on the location, season and intensity of the explosion.|`|vxNU56HQaa	Nuclear winter is a term that describes the predicted climatic effects of nuclear war. Severely cold weather and reduced sunlight for a period of months or years would be caused by detonating large numbers of nuclear weapons, especially over flammable targets such as cities, where large amounts of smoke and soot would be injected into the Earth's stratosphere|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	Nuclear winter is a theoretical concept which has been put forward by some members of the scientific community. It originated in 1982 with John Birks and Paul Crutzen. Put briefly, the detonation of large numbers of nuclear weapons could trigger a dramatic change in the global climate, causing extreme cold and potentially resulting in serious trouble for the living organisms which call Earth home. Numerous studies on the possibility of nuclear winter have been conducted, and it is difficult to prove that it would happen in the event of a nuclear war, but it is one of the many arguments used against nuclear attacks on other nations.    According to the theories, nuclear winter would be caused by a huge cloud of dust, smoke, and particulate matter resulting from large-scale detonations over cities around the world. As the cities and surrounding areas burned, they could inject huge amounts of material into the atmosphere, slowly blocking sunlight. Because sunlight would not be able to reach Earth, global temperatures would drop dramatically, and our ability to produce food would be greatly reduced.|`|52cGZS3caa	The science fiction phenomena caused by a nuclear war.

In other words, Lepidoptera means scaly wings.    As the order name implies, the powder like materials found on the Butterfly wings are called scales.    Butterfly wings have two membranous layers which are made up of chitinous materials. Wings are nourished by a number of tubular veins which play a significant role in oxygen exchange.

There are two fundamental mechanisms by which colous are produced on butterfly wings. the ordinary colour, the first one, is due to the presence of chemical pigments, which absorb certain wavelengths of the light and transmit or reflect others.    The second colour, which is known as iridescent colour, is produced by the interference of light due to multiple reflections within the physical structure of a material and thus most of the butterflies exhibit brilliant iridescence on their wings.

ixzVKzBjaa	$29.50-$29.50(.25) = $22.13|`|l2BjWA5Baa	First you need to figure out what 25% of $29.50 is so you know how much to take off.  Here's a math tip to remember: "of" always means "multiplied by."    25% is the same thing as .25 (if you're rusty on converting fractions to decimals, message me), so this problem is 29.50 * .25, which is 7.375.  You can't have half cents, so round up (because the last digit is a 5) to get $7.38.  Remember, though, that this is the amount you're taking OFF, not the sale price itself, so subtract the discount ($7.38) from the original price ($29.50) to get the sale price ($22.12)!|`|zYriuUiWaa	29.50 * .75 = 22.13|`|pVmwGyQ6aa	29.5*.25 = 7.375    29.5-7.375 = 22.125 ~ $22.13    never round until the end!|`|KoAPT42Oaa	25% off, means the new price is equal to 75% the old price  29.50*75/100  = $22.125|`|IA4x5oPMaa	$22.13|`|A96Wyoj8aa	$29.50 / 1.25 = answer|`|AA11164893	If $29.50 is the price after 25% off, it is 75% of the original price.

Let S equal pounds of strawberries and B equal pounds of bananas.    You know that you'll have five pounds total, so S + B = 5, right?    Now you need an equation for total cost (1.70), which is the cost of the bananas plus the cost of the strawberries.  The cost of the bananas is going to be the cost per pound (.30) times how many pounds of bananas (B), so that's .30B. Same with strawberries -> 2.30S, so 2.30S + .30B = 1.70.    And there are your two equations! If you need further explanation or want to check your answer, email me.

BDKqYOSraa	You are right on a few points, Stars.  1)   Betablockers and Provigil are options (among many) for the treatment of performance anxiety and  "shift worker sleep disorder" respectively.  2)   You will seem like a drug seeker if you walk into a physician's office with a shopping list of specific drugs.  "I'll have some Provigil, propranolol and a side of french fries."    Drug shopping lists are a pet-peeve for most physicians.   You also "pigeon hole" yourself into a presumptive diagnosis and limited treatments.  Isn't it possible that there are more diagnoses and treatment options then you are aware of?    Your best bet is to see a reputable primary care physician (board certification is a must) and tell him/her your symptoms.|`|icgTII3Maa	Beta blockers are prescribed for performance anxiety, especially if the anxiety is hindering the performance. But, it is not advisable to take it often since you may become dependent on it every time you need to perform. It may also be the adrenaline that is giving you the strength to perform.    At this young age, you can still manage a lot of things, without the help of medications. At least, without them, you can still keep your liver healthy instead of bombarding it with medicines.|`|UmPJ3i6Gaa	It is unlikely that your physician will do as you ask.

Might I suggest you picture the audience naked as a non-chemical method of overcoming your stage fright.|`|d8d012acc7e2b07077c8bf60a2d1f9c5aa	You're exactly right.  Some beta blockers are approved by the FDA to treat preformance anxiety.  The more common ones are propranolol and timolol.  They do not have any risk of dependence, but you still may have some side effects.  Side effects could include dizziness, slow heart rate, and others.  If you have asthma, certain beta blockers can make it worse.  If you have diabetes, using a beta blocker could mask the symptoms of low blood sugar.    As you can see, there are definitely things to consider, but beta blockers are a good alternative (if they work for you) rather than drugs like Valium or Xanax.

You simply can't afford to keep a $3,000 bull around for 6 head of cows.  After they calve, and the calves are eating grass too...well you won't have any grass left w/ 13 head on your place.  Not to mention you'll be buying hay for 13 head about year round.  Your only looking at about $1,200 profit per yr from the calf crop.  Now take the 1,200 and subtract feed, hay, vacs, vet expences, and your 45 day weaning (hay and double the grain).  Now your about out of any profit.

oZrfOhG0aa	I can interpret your question in more than one way, so I'll see if I can answer what you're trying to ask.    A computer screen produces light using one of two methods, a cathode ray tube (CRT) or an liquid crystal display (LCD).  So neither in itself is a fluorescent light source.  The CRT is similar to a light bulb with a filament that you'd use in your house.  An LCD is a little harder to explain how it works, but it passes light though the liquid crystal matrix to get the color.  Fluorescence by contrast uses an electrical charge or light energy to change the energy state of a substance.  Fluorescence relies on the energy state of electrons in the fluorescent object.  When struck by a light of the proper wavelength, or the electrical charge, the electrons in the outer shells go to  a more excited state and release the energy back as a different colored wavelength.  So an object that looks white under normal lighting can be green, red, blue, or some other color under blacklight or UV.  Your computer screen doesn't contain the elements with these electrons, only a photograph of them.  To get your computer screen to fluoresce, it would have to be made of a substance that would also fluoresce.    If you're looking at a photograph of something fluorescent on your computer screen, you should be able to see a reasonably good approximation of the colors.  Try looking at this photo:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/pineapplebu...    But you might not be able to get your computer screen to fluoresce if looking at a normally fluorescent object on the screen under a blacklight or UV light.|`|q1MwnSbcaa	whats a "florescent color"?

zf8BnU6Yaa	Water temperature has little or no effect on the flow rate of the river.  The slope of the river bed is important and the geometry of the river including the bed width and bank height will have some minor effect if the river is narrow.  The roughness of the river bed and sides also will have an effect of slowing down the river.  Also if the river is winding it will tend to be longer and have a lower slope and flow slower.

Photosynthesis occurs in plants, algae, and many species of Bacteria, but not in Archaea. Photosynthetic organisms are called photoautotrophs, but not all organisms that use light as a source of energy carry out photosynthesis, since photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon. In plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. Photosynthesis is crucially important for life on Earth, since as well as it maintaining the normal level of oxygen in the atmosphere, nearly all life either depends on it directly as a source of energy, or indirectly as the ultimate source of the energy in their food. The amount of energy trapped by photosynthesis is immense, approximately 100 terawatts per year: which is about seven times larger than the yearly power consumption of human civilization. In all, photosynthetic organisms convert around 100,000,000,000 tonnes of carbon into biomass per year.|`|SHDgd8mRaa	its a question that belongs in the biology section|`|YVkN1I5Laa	photosynthesis is a process in which plants and sometimes animals get energy from the sun to create sugers.    here is a picture   http://www.1ststeps.org/Science/Photosyn...

Most viruses don't undergo the same rigorous quality control during replication that our own genomes due, so mutations are introduced in the virus genome with each replication. If a particular genome produces a virus that's a more effective replicator (for example, if the changed genome makes the virus more capable of evading the host immune system) then that genotype will increase in frequency. Over time, you can track changes in the different types of virus within a single subject.

4BqjVDxaaa	Consider the system as the cup, water and the nickel as a closed system. The conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Accordingly, we can set up an equation like this.    (If Q represents heat)    Qtotal = 0, since energy is conserved and it is a closed system, no heat is added or lost  Qtotal = Qwater + Qnickel    Recall that change in Q = mass * specific heat capacity * change in temperature     Qwater = mass * specific heat * (Final temp of water - Initial temp)  Qnickel = mass * specific heat * (Final temp of nickel - Initial temp)    Let c be the specific heat capacity:    0 = 150 * 4.184 * (25 - 23.5) + 28.2 * c * (25 - 99.8)    Solve for c, which gives ~.44 J/(g * Celsius)

AA11513203	There have actually been a lot of similar housefly (and fruit-fly) experiments that have done just that ... isolated different populations, exposed them to different conditions, and measured how long it takes them to *speciate* (lose the ability to cross-breed ... which makes them separate species).    These usually examine what's called 'allopatric speciation' ... where the two habitats are *completely* isolated from each other.  It has been demonstrated many times that different environments, when isolated for a long enough time, can produce speciation in a surprisingly small number of generations (see my second source, below).       But what you're describing would be an experiment in what's called 'parapatric speciation' (I'll add the the wikipedia page as my first source, as it describes this nicely).  There are two separate environments, but they are *not* completely isolated ... the two environments are in contact (the flies in both environments can interbreed freely, and can cross freely into both environments).       Three things are at play.    First, since the flies can travel back and forth, if one environment is much more (or much less) desireable than the other, the flies will tend to congregate in the more desireable (or least undesireable) environment.  E.g. if the CO2 level is *too* high, the flies of course can't survive at all ... but if there is just a little difference, then most flies will just tend to move away from it.    Second, After the initial movement to the best environment (A), they may run out of room there, and some outliers will try to make a living in (B).  E.g. if some flies are born with a slightly higher tolerance for CO2, then they may *prefer* B because there is less competition there.   Thus the more CO2-tolerant flies will be co-mingling more with other CO2-tolerant flies, and a new breed of extra-CO2-tolerant flies may start emerging.    Third, however, to the extent that the flies are able to interbreed between the two chambers, any strong tendency to *speciate* will be slow.   Yes more CO2-tolerant flies are being born, but they are continuing to mate with non-CO2-tolerant flies.   This does not mean they *cannot* speciate ... only that this will be much slower.   However, if the opening between the chambers is very small, so that interbreeding is very rare, then this could tend, over time to produce faster speciation.    So the optimal condition would be when the opening is fairly wide at the beginning allowing flies to travel back and forth freely (which would allow the slow segregation of flies who are slightly more tolerant to chamber B) ... but with that opening slowly closing as time went on (simulating what might happen in nature when a habitat slowly divides in two as the intervening territory disappears).    This was a great question!|`|Gakug3eoaa	yes, this possible. I'm interested in your contained enviroment though.

Keep me informed, my email is treehuggerofthesummer@ymail.com|`|3BGJETHYaa	I'd say that you could force changes this way, but you'd need a rather large container- houseflies have a large natural range, and to have a chance of differentiation you would need to impose a penalty of going from one area to another, and distance is the most standard.    I'd suggest using a much more slow-moving and mobile bug than a housefly.

This means that 2 of the angles are equal. Those angles must be acute because a triangle can't have 2 obtuse angles (why?). So the question is:    Is the angle between the two equal sides right,acute, or obtuse.    In a right triangle:    a^2 + b^2 = c^2    If 7^2 + 7^2 = 10^2, it is a right triangle.    but,    49 + 49 = 98.    So if the angle was 90 degrees the longest side would be less than 10.  Lets pretend we have that triangle in our hands. If we wanted transform it so the longest side was 10 while leaving the other two sides at 7 we would have increase the angle above 90 degrees. So the 7-7-10 triangle is obtuse.    To summarize:    in an isosceles triangle with sides (k,k,m)  if  k^2 + k^2 = m^2  it's a right triangle.    if  k^2 + k^2   it's an obtuse triangle    if  k^2 + k^2 > m^2  it's an acute triangle    Also,    if k + k = m  it is a straight triangle, which is not a triangle at all, it's a line segment of length m.|`|6eVyP3xpaa	very slightly obtuse.

UFteXlqwaa	A high pressure means cold or warm weather depending on the season and your latitude.    In a high pressure, the lack of clouds and wind, brings heat of the sun during the day, and dissipate it at night by radiation back into space.    But is the gain during the day superior to the loss during the night? It all depends on the season and latitude.    If you are far south, the sun is so high that the heat of the day will always be greater than the loss at night.    As you move north, there will be a date of "break-even" where only the summer side of the date brings more heat for each day of high pressure.    For example, I live near Oslo, Norway, at latitude 60 N. For us, the sun is so low over the horizon that nearly half of the year, a low pressure brings colder and colder days. It is not before March that we get our "break-even" time and after March that a stationary high pressure brings warmer days.    Note that a high pressure doesn't bring dry air in itself. But since the air sinks and warms up adiabatically, moisture in the air evaporates. But it is still there. While the relative humidity will sink, the absolute one (how many grams of water per cubic meter of air) remains the same.    And this is why, in a high pressure, you can get early morning dew, haze and even fog. As the surface of the earth cools down during the night, an inversion (warm air above cold one) forms and the moisture near a lake or sea, condenses in haze or fog in the early hours of the day.

UFteXlqwaa	First, you may ask yourself: Why is it a low pressure? Well, the pressure sinks when the air rises.    And what can make air rise? It can be the terrain that lifts air masses but most often it is simply the heating of the ground by the sun: warm air near the ground rises.    As air rises, it cools down by adiabatic effet: the result of an expansion due to lower pressure. The same principle is what cools your refrigerator when a gas is released through a nozzle.    But when air cools down, it can contain less moisture. It has to condense into small droplets of water; the clouds.    But the funny thing is that when water condenses, it gives away heat. It is the opposite of evaporation that cools your skin when you sweat.    And because extra energy is brought in form of heat, the cloud continues to rise, condensing even more and finally the moisture comes down as rain.    If there is enough moist and warm air at the surface, and it is cold enough aloft, the process can continue and increase in size. That low pressure then needs to fill and that's what creates the stormy wind when surrounding air masses rush in to even the pressure.
Q2sZhNmJaa	Here are some ideas    Plumber Magic   Take two clean old-fashioned, red rubber-and-wood-stick plungers and stick them together (you may need to wet the rims first). Try to separate them. Why is it so hard? When you rammed them together, air was forced out of the cavity that the insides make when pushed together, leaving you with a lower air pressure pocket inside, compared to the surrounding air pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) outside the plungers. Higher pressure always pushes and thus is keeping the plungers together.    Magic Egg Trick   Remove the shell from a hard-boiled egg and use a bottle with a neck large enough that the egg can be squeezed through (without squashing it)  old fashioned milk bottles work great. Light a match and toss it in, quickly setting the egg (small-end down) on the mouth of the bottle. The air inside gets used up by the flame, lowering the air pressure inside the bottle. The higher pressure, now outside the bottle, pushes on the egg and pops it in. (To remove the egg, turn the bottle upside down and get the egg to be small-end down inside the bottle near the mouth. Blow hard into the mouth of the bottle.)    Fountain Bottle   Seal a 2-liter soda water bottle (half-full of water) with a lump of clay wrapped around a long straw, sealing the straw to the mouth of the bottle. Blow hard into the straw. As you blow air into the bottle, the air pressure increases. This higher pressure pushes on the water, which gets forced up and out the straw.    Ping Pong Funnel   Insert a ping pong ball into a funnel and blow hard. (You can tilt your head back so that the ball end points to the ceiling. Can you blow hard enough so when you invert the funnel, the ball stays inside? Can you pick up a ball from the table? As you blow into the funnel, the air where the ball sits in the funnel moves faster and generates lower air pressure than the rest of the air surrounding the ball. This means that the pressure under the ball is lower than the surrounding air which is, by comparison, a higher pressure. This higher pressure pushes the ball back into the funnel no matter how hard you blow or which way you hold the funnel.    Squished Soda Can   Heat an empty soda can (large beer cans actually will work better if you have one) in a skillet with a few tablespoons of water in the can over a hot stove. Have a shallow dish with about ? inch of ice water handy (enough water to make a seal with the top of the can). When the can emits steam, grab the can with tongs and quickly invert it into the dish. CRACK! The air in the can was heated, and things that are hot tend to expand. When you cool it quickly by taking it off the stove onto a cold plate, the air cools down and shrinks, creating a lower pressure inside. Since the surrounding air outside of the can is now higher, it pushes on all sides of the can and crushes it.|`|v1xDXHG5aa	These sites have lots of science fair project ideas:    http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/Resources/Gettin...    http://www.sciencebuddies.org/    http://www.all-science-fair-projects.com...    http://www.ipl.org/div/projectguide/    http://school.discoveryeducation.com/sci...    http://www.picadome.fcps.net/lab/sci_fai...    http://www.scienceproject.com/    http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/projects/i...    http://www.freesciencefairproject.com/    http://www.hometrainingtools.com/article...

4BqjVDxaaa	It is hard to contain and transport. The means in which to obtain hydrogen is questionable as well, as it is not present in natural reservoirs. Most of the hydrogen on Earth is in the form of water, which takes energy to reduce down to it's component parts again.|`|pBSKTPJhaa	Hydrogen was added in small amounts (5%, 10% and 15% on the energy basis) to biogas and tested in a spark ignition engine at constant speed at different equivalence ratios to study the effects on performance, emissions and combustion. Hydrogen significantly enhances the combustion rate and extends the lean limit of combustion of biogas. There is an improvement in brake thermal efficiency and brake power. However, beyond 15% hydrogen the need to retard the ignition timing to control knock does not lead to improvements at high equivalence ratios. Significant reductions in hydrocarbon levels were seen. There was no increase in nitric oxide emissions due to the use of retarded ignition timing and the presence of carbon dioxide. Peak pressures and heat release rates are lower with hydrogen addition as the ignition timing is to be retarded to avoid knock. There is a reduction in cycle-by-cycle variations in combustion with lean mixtures. On the whole 10% hydrogen addition was found to be the most suitable.

DU2THcAdaa	It is also important to consider how much oxygen the water contains... fish need to breathe too!  If a lake was frozen for an uncommonly long duration it is possible that oxygen levels could fall to a level at which the majority of fish would perish. However, there are many factors which affect oxygen levels in water so you would need to consider these, in addition to the points already raised.    Check out the article below for a more detailed response to this question.|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	If the lake is deep enough it will not freeze completely.  The lake freezes from the top down because the air is colder than the water and the water looses heat.  Some fish are still active but at a much lower pace than when the water is warmer and they require less oxygen as well.  So when a film of ice forms, it kind of keeps the warmer water from loosing so much heat.  The coldest water is lowest, and ice is lighter than water so it is on top.  But it insulates the water from losing heat so rapidly and when you take the heat out of the water to make ice you need to remove a whole lot of heat to do so.  So as the water keeps freezing to ice, it tends to slow down in doing so and that is why a lot of lakes don't freeze solid.|`|Jqg7Hvfiaa	They die before it freezes.|`|oyvRHQmaaa	Only the surface freezes, if the water has any depth.....

Therefore it's the same height as if the bullet were fired upward at 160 m/s.  You may know the equation: v2  = 2gh  or h = v2 /2g  You can solve this for h, but the answer comes out to about 1280m, so none of the answers looks very good.  If you don't know that equation, it is found as follows:  the time to the top of its rise is found from v=gt  The height is the average speed times the time: h = vt/2  Substitute t=v/g in this last equation, and you'll get the equation I gave you in the beginning.

For example, the cell must be in an environment that will stabilize and promote growth and also must have enough energy to undertake this process.

VxZl2hTcaa	You'll definitely want to use the hint:  consider g(x) = f(x) - x    If we can find a value x_0 such that g(x_0) = 0, then we will know that:  f(x_0) - x_0 = 0  f(x_0) = x_0    So let's use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to find x_0.  Our function is defined on the interval [0,1] (the domain).  Let's consider the two endpoints.    First of all, notice that for x = 0, we have:  g(0) = f(0) - 0 = f(0)    We know the range of f(x) is [0,1], so f(0) is in [0,1], and thus g(0) is in [0,1].  In other words, g(0) >= 0.    And for x = 1, we have:  g(1) = f(1) - 1    Again, we know f(1) is in [0,1], but now this means that g(1) is in [-1,0].  In other words, g(1)     So we know g(0) >= 0 and g(1)     Then for this x_0 we have f(x_0) = x_0.|`|tJa60S4Taa	what is x_0? I'm guessing some characters aren't showing up...

rvTcDJ6yaa	Darwin considered that change was gradual...gradualism. where change is occurring slowly but gradually over time.    While this happens in some cases where conditions are unchaging usually, for the vast majority change happens after some change in the environment eg climate change eg wamer, hotter, wetter, drier.  or introduction of new species eg predators, prey, new plant species, whatever.    THis means there are long periods of little or even no change and then a short period of ( eg million or so years) where a lot of change occurs, new species arise and species become extinct....this will happen over and over again.

XZatdDHjaa	From the DNA sequence, we can determine the mRNA sequence by using the principles of complementation. For example, a sequence ACC in the DNA will yield a mRNA sequence of UGG. Adenine will match with Thymine (or Uracil in RNA) and Cytosine will match with Guanine, and vice versa. Thus, a DNA sequence ATGC will have a complementary will have a mRNA of UACG.     Once you figure out the mRNA sequence, apply complementation again to figure out the sequence of the tRNA. Another way to think about tRNA is that the tRNA sequence is simply the DNA sequence, except with U's in place of T's in DNA. This "double-flip" thus is a representative copy of the DNA.    The mRNA is the molecule that is responsible for taking from the DNA to the protein-making machine (ribosome). The tRNA matches the mRNA and will have the amino acids of choice.    Every three tRNA base (the "triplet") is responsible for one amino acid, and thus every three letter will represent one amino acid.    I will help you with the first part:    DNA - A C C | G G T | T A T   mRNA - U G G | C C A | A U A  tRNA - A C C | G G U | U A U  Amino Acid - 20,12, 13  The trait for this sequence is 'Hairy'.    Just follow this procedure, and you'll get really good at this. Good Luck!

aYiVn74saa	because the outskirts of town contain more dry air, the city is more humid|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	That is not always true.Last year numerous towns where leveled,|`|xHcQSLiVaa	It has to do with temperature and air pressure differentials.  A tornado will have a greater chance of skipping over a town or city because the entire air mass over roads and parking lots is moving up as a whole.|`|xAdOhtaoaa	thats kinda how it is i guess idk|`|2CBxqNcaaa	Happenstance.  Random and unpredictable.|`|YAttCSf2aa	Truly, The answer is a combination of the above, as well as a few other facts to note. Quite a bit of it is sheer luck as to where the tornado forms, conditions have to be just right in the atmosphere for one to form.     Actually, the outskirts of town can generally be more humid (especially in the midwest) this is due to evapotranspiration (plants letting off moisture) which occurs more in the country than in a city    I do agree about cities being warmer (due to roads, cars, etc.), and the fact that warm air rises which would diminish the chance of a tornado, since a tornado is on the downdraft (air moving downward) side of the storm.     Also pushing air in a city upward is buildings, as a storm moves it sends out what is known as a gust front, a wind ahead of the storm, in rural areas, this wind can flow freely around trees and fields, but as houses and buildings become more dense,  causing SOME of the air to rise, even though it may not be to a huge extent, although this part is mostly speculation as to how it would affect a tornado.    Also, in the midwest (one of the main areas tornadoes form) especially, there are very few towns for the tornadoes to hit, a lot of the midwest (mot to mention southeast) is fields, and rural areas, so by proportion of rural to urban land area, tornadoes are more likely in rural areas.
Rtah7p3yaa	The Soviet Union's space program is the only one ever to have landed on Venus, and being primarily a military organization, all of its internal details were classified. The agency was dissolved at the time of the collapse of the regime, and many details have never been released to the public. I could find only one reference to the materials that *may have* been used for the Venera parachute and its cords, and even that reference describes the material as an unknown, heat-resistant fiber (see source). In any case, the parachute was not intended to be in use for the entire descent, the density of the lower atmosphere being sufficient for air braking, and did in fact burn and/or melt away from the landing craft.    The Vega landers deployed balloon-borne sensors to further explore the atmosphere: these were made from a form of Teflon called Ftorlon and lasted at least the 46 hours that the batteries continued to supply power to the instruments.

mKBZmH1Laa	Sad to say, but it seems that your Salvia is bound to die. You said the above part is mushy. Does this apical portion appears dark brown or blackish in color? Is it smelly (bacterial infection)? If yes, these are signs of tissue death. Remember that this topmost portion contains the apical meristem from which new tissues (and later organs, e.g. leaves, flowers, etc) originate. So cutting this part will totally remove the 'chances' of regenerating new tissues (though I doubt that keeping it intact will have any benefit).    You mentioned also that it has no nodes. Located along the node is a lateral meristem called axillary meristem (named as such because it's positioned at the leaf axil) whose features and functions are similar to that of the apical meristem but it (axillary meristem) stay dormant in the presence of the latter. Had your plant has a node, death or removal of the apical part will induced the growth of this axillary meristem; new leaves will be produced and thus better chance of survival.    By the way, what do you mean when you said it was a clone? Was it tissue-cultured? From cuttings? Layered? When you say a plant is a clone (clonally-propagated), it means it has the same characteristics (genotype) as that of the "mother" plant, and this is true for asexually-propagated and MOST tissue-cultured plants. Especially if it's tissue-cultured (and I believe this is the case of your plant because of the small size [about 2 inches]), special care must be given. In our case, we acclimatize regenerated plants, i.e. upon removal from tissue culture bottle, we transfer the plants to appropriate medium and placed in high RH- and optimum light-area before the final transfer outdoors (and eventually selling). If indeed, your plant is tissue-cultured, I don't know why they sold it at a very young stage (small size) as they are pretty much sensitive to outdoor conditions much more to shipment stress.    What's the color of the remaining stem? Using the nail in your forefinger, you may carefully pinch a spot from this stem and check whether if it is starting to show pitting (dry and rigid). In the case that it is still green, this means that this "stump" can photosynthesize but I doubt that this will alleviate the condition of your plant because they're not forever photosynthetic-capable. If you're sure that it's nodeless and the top portion is more or less dead, there is no more chance of leaf production (to do photosynthesis), which is needed for plant growth and development.    Finally, you have two options left: have them replace your Salvia plant or get your money back =D|`|0mb78CiWaa	No, I don't think it can survive. If I were you I would try returning it or replacing it wherever you ordered it form.|`|538523e3667a51117dd777ea15415bbfaa	it may be able to, but it will need lots of light (what the leaves specialize in)    dont cut off the mushy parts, they keep the system water-sealed, if you cut it open, the plant will dry out.    dont use any extra fertilizer, just lotsa light and water and youll be getting high in no time! ;-)|`|VQruWRDsaa	so no nodes does not mean the end of the life for the plant. Of course, plants need their leaves to act as solar power panels for energy and such. Nevertheless I think you would be surprised at what can grow with no leaves. A seedling can create chloroplasts with very little light in its stem only (this is prior to leaf production). Therefore I think your plant would be fine the way it is, I would not cut anything but just let it grow and see what happens, making sure it gets plenty of sunlight and nutrients. Obviously, it has gone through quite a shock being shipped to you.
0BVT0K0Gaa	Ha, i was working on my math hw. and saw your question and couldn't continue on my problems until i solved this problem. so yeah, there's only one problem.    When you simplify and get cos^2 (1-sin^2/(cos^2))      The way i did it    ok , so we simplify but putting (sin^2/cos^2) instead of tan    and we put cos^2 instead of (1/sec^2)    So we get integral of (sin^2) cos^2                                                                 ------------------                                                                      cos^2    As you can see the cos^2 cancels and you get int. of sin^2 which you solve by using u substitution.    hoped that made sense.       the line -------- means over...i tried to make it look like it was below but didn't work.

Friction is when you try to move something and something else such as air pressure and gravity and very rough floors make it stop because it takes away energy. In space there is no friction because there's nothing in space, hence called "space" and the only thing that's in space is probably something like Helium atoms, but there's no force that stops the baseball from moving. The baseball doesnt accelerate either, because no force is pushing it. Without force pushing it, it never go faster.

Ww4Va6sqaa	And their orbits also have a low inclination to the Martian equator.|`|E0U2yII3aa	Theory holds it that Mars once had a very thick atmosphere. However, the once very thick atmosphere dissipated from the solar wind due to a weak magnetic field. The connection? Earlier, the thick atmosphere may have provided enough brakes for the dissipation of energy as the asteroids were captured. As energy is dissipated into the atmosphere through time, this led the asteroids to migrate in more circular orbits near the equator. Anyway, they are not that large.|`|2kaKLBBHaa	They are still elliptical though.|`|4apYtDp7aa	As time passes, it is possible for the asteroids to develop more circular orbits, just as how earth can affect the path of an asteroid and it could come back to hit earth the next time it passes earth. A planet can only capture an asteroid if it comes close, and when it does that, it changes the path of the asteroid by trapping it with its gravitational field.
	Is the Universe aware? Why don't you ask It?    You are misunderstanding the nature of light though - it doesn't switch from wave to particle, it remains what it is. It's the type of interaction, not the act of observation, that determines which model best describes its behavior. Light propagating through space is best described as a wave. When that wave transfers energy to matter, it *behaves like* a particle. Without that interaction we have no way of detecting it, so all photons act like particles when observed.|`|	Maybe you're thinking about God? Is God the Universe?

OSqQZwGYaa	Cyclohexane is not flat due to a few reasons:     the torsional strain would also be considerable due to all eclipsed bonds. Therefore, to reduce torsional strain, cyclohexane adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the chair conformation. The new conformation puts the carbons at an angle of 109.5. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring (equatorial) while the other half are perpendicular to the plane (axial). This conformation allows for the most stable structure of cyclohexane. Another conformation of cyclohexane exists, known as boat conformation, but it interconverts to the slightly more stable chair formation.

5al0K3N0aa	Good question. Actually I'm not too sure but at least oxygen (O-16) will be produced because the CNO cycle does occur in the Sun, even if only in small amounts it would be significant compared to the metals (anything heavier than O-16).     You're right that it would have to be in the core though.    **edit**  CNO contributes only 2% to the energy of the Sun; so heavy elements are pretty much out. As the Sun becomes a red giant though, He-4 burning occurs and eventually Si-28 will start fusing. This will lead to the production of Fe-56. This is the only point in the Sun's life that significant amounts of Fe-56 are produced (measurably).|`|AA10929465	It only goes up to iron-56 from fusion.  Heavier elements are formed in supernovae from nucleosynthesis.|`|9GMePSopaa	My guess would be Iron and Nickel.  Since the sun is a relatively small star, it won't be in huge quantities, comparatively.    That's not definite, but that's what my common sense tells me, since fusion increases mass to a more stable one - where Iron and Nickel are the more stable nucleides.|`|Yzcptoagaa	Currently, the sun only fuses hydrogen and makes helium.  When the sun runs out of hydrogen, it will begin to fuse helium into heavier elements.  That will happen about 5 billion years from now when the sun becomes a red giant.    There are some heavier elements in the core of the sun, but they are not undergoing nuclear fusion.|`|t7WET23Paa	Play-Doh|`|79001534b8f79771dce5eae9d3d448a7aa	It seems to be iron.

(cotx) = (1/tanx) = (cosx/sinx)    (cscx) = (1/sinx)    ok so if we take cotx/cscx, we get (cosx/sinx)/(1/sinx), your sines cancel if you flip the bottom fraction (remember that to divide fractions, do this: keep it (the first fraction) change it (divide to multiply) and rearrange it (flip 2nd fraction).     so now you have the integral of   (sinx + cosx) dx    depending on your interval from a --> b    the antiderivative of those are easy to take since its a sum,    antiderivative of sinx = -cosx  andiderivative of cosx = sinx    so you have (-cosa + sina) - (-cosb + sinb) where a,b are the lower and upper bounds of your interval respectively.

IUmAflSqaa	I'm kind of confused.  It looks to me like all you need to show here is that int(K(x,y) dy) is a continuous function of x.  Once you've shown this, the function f(x), whether it's continuous or not, is uniquely defined by f(x) = g(x)+int(K(x,y) dy), and it has to be continuous, being the sum of two continuous functions.    But there are all of these conditions floating around on K, and they don't need to be there.  First, without these conditions, K still satisfies similar conditions--the function and the integrals are still bounded, just not necessarily in the way the problem states.  Second, making K positive and insisting that the integrals are bounded below 1 doesn't change the nature of the problem--these facts aren't used at all in the proof that int(K(x,y) dy) is continuous.    So... are you sure you posted the question correctly?

xkAZ0REoaa	This was one of my exam questions last year!  Flight has many advantages. It allows for quick escape from predators and gives them a large advantage over prey (whether that is other insects or the ability to reach plant foods that could not be accessed directly from the ground as well as enabling access to distant food sources). The wings themselves are often an advantage since if a bird or some other animal was to take a nip at them, they might only lose part of a wing instead of their lives. It also enables them to hide from predators by being able to reach better shelter. This access to better living space also gives them the advantage of being able to hide away their eggs more easily. Additionally, the ability to move great distances allows for breeding with other populations which counteracts the inbreeding depression that some non-flight animals suffer from.|`|4b7RMhkmaa	Well it allowed it to escape from predators on the land.

In many decay phenomina defined by decay time constants this becomes:    initial*e^-(time/TimeConstant)    at time =0, e^0 = 1, so initial value  At time = infinity, e^-infinity = 0 so none left.  At time = 1 time constant , e^-1=.3678    But Half life is a special case of decay, because you are not interested in steps of 1/e (that defines a time constant of decay), but steps of 1/2. so you have to scale the (time /TimeConstant) power by the ln (0.5) so that the time constants are steps of 0.5 (half lifes) instead of 1/e (time constants) and the decay time constant changes from time constant to half life.    That leaves us with  Initial*e^-ln(0.5)*(time /HalfLife)    I think that covers it.  Oh, time has to be in the same units as the constant, HalfLife.    --   Regards,
TKT95sKdaa	1) Antisymmetric is really the only interesting one:  Let u,v in n such that uv and vu.  Then given a part y in u, there is a part z in v such that y is a subset of z.  Similarly, there is an element y' in u such that z is a subset of y'.  Given any element x in y, x is in z, and then x is in y'; and since x is in the intersection of y and y', it follows that y=y'.  Then it follows that y=z.  Finally, this shows that every part in u is a part in v and vice versa, so we have that u = v.    Both the others (reflexive and transitive) follow almost immediately from the definition.

XZatdDHjaa	Convert all your units to the same system.    (180 km/hr)(1000 m/1 km)(1 hr/3600 seconds) = 50 m/s  The position of the speeder is: x = (50 m/s)*t      Assuming that the police cruiser accelerates uniformly at a rate of 3.9 m/s/s, we can define his position as: x = (1/2)(3.9 m/s/s)(t^2).    If they have the same displacement, then:    (1.95 m/s/s)(t^2) = (50 m/s)*t  (1.95 m/s/s)*t = 50 m/s  t = (50 m/s)/(1.95 m/s/s) = 25.64 seconds.    The overall displacement is the same for the police and the speeder.  Plugging in t=25.64 seconds, we find that x = 1282 m.

z23lyifAaa	Ethanoic, or acetic acid is glacial when there is no water present.  In that form (pure), it forms little 'iceburg' like crystals as it freezes just below 17C.  So it got a nickname based upon how it looks as it freezes.|`|3BSsEQIXaa	Glacial acetic acid is a trivial name for water-free acetic acid. Similar to the German name Eisessig (literally, ice-vinegar), the name comes from the ice-like crystals that form slightly below room temperature at 16.7 C (about 62 F).|`|94ab0da7299b6d087039f5b8d0109652aa	Acetic acid, also known as ethanoic acid, is an organic chemical compound, giving vinegar its sour taste and pungent smell. Its structural formula is represented as CH3COOH. Pure, water-free acetic acid (glacial acetic acid) is a colourless liquid that absorbs water from the environment (hygroscopy), and freezes below 16.7 C (62 F) to a colourless crystalline solid. Acetic acid is corrosive, and its vapour causes irritation to the eyes, a dry and burning nose, sore throat and congestion to the lungs. It is a weak acid because at standard conditions for temperature and pressure the dissociated acid exists in equilibrium with the undissociated form in aqueous solutions, in contrast to strong acids, which are fully dissociated.    Acetic acid is one of the simplest carboxylic acids (the second-simplest, next to formic acid). It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical that is used in the production of polyethylene terephthalate mainly used in soft drink bottles; cellulose acetate, mainly for photographic film; and polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, as well as synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households diluted acetic acid is often used in descaling agents. In the food industry acetic acid is used under the food additive code E260 as an acidity regulator.    The global demand of acetic acid is around 6.5 million tonnes per year (Mt/a), of which approximately 1.5 Mt/a is met by recycling; the remainder is manufactured from petrochemical feedstocks or from biological sources.

There could be life on Neptune now. The kind of life we look for is life consisting of our own elements, like carbon and things of that nature. But who's to say life can exist within the confines of other planets with a whole realm of elements unknown to us?    That's just a question that can't be answered correctly at this point in our history. ^_^|`|AA11564934	there's a possibility, but the probability is  about 0.000000000001%.    Why?  Because we don't know every single possible environment that can engender/support life.|`|QYDYX9B7aa	No.    The temperature is too low to sustain any chemical reactions that can run in living cells.     Although Neptune has Carbon, Nitrogen, and hydrogen, there is no oxygen or sulfur to carry out redox reactions in metabolism.

UFteXlqwaa	The equator is a place that is very hot because the sun is high all year round. Here, the air rises after being warmed up near the ground. It is a place of low pressure since the rising air lower the pressure.    On the top of the troposphere, when that air is cooled down, it moves away from the equator and - in the northern hemisphere, is diverted to the right by the Coriolis force, and comes down, creating a belt of high pressure around the latitude 30 N.    In a high pressure, air sinks and warms up adiabatically. That dissolves all the moisture in the air and the sky is clear.    Because of that, the climate of the Sahara is dry and  - as you write - warm during the day and cold during the night.    But that is most noticeable inland. Near the coast of the Atlantic; more precisely in Mauritania, the ocean evens out the temperature and the climate is milder. I have been there many years ago, when it was still the Spanish Sahara.

XZatdDHjaa	Cell transformation is basically uptake of free DNA. Certain microorganisms are capable of this, and are used in pharmacological research. Since all DNA has the same quartet of nucleotides (a language if you will), these organisms can take foreign DNA and make proteins from it (can read any other organism's genetic information). However, a downside of transformation (for us) is that it can cause same bacteria to become resistant to a certain antibiotic.

5e0c2b6e245998c415bb4509ecae5500aa	Who's to say what's possible? It's not possible, or reasonable right now. Maybe some day.  The reason it's not possible is because our body's function as systems, not as a bunch of individual parts.  For instance if we injected the "wing gene" into a human, wouldn't we also have to adjust our circulatory system genes to give blood to the wing? what about our nervous system to control it? also there is what's called hox genes which tell our bodies what goes where, we would have to adjust these or the wings would die.      Another HUGE obstacle to overcome is embryology.  or how we develop from egg to human (or frog or whatever we're talking about) It's a very complex system (hugely understated).  and to include an entire new organ or wing or limb or anything would take massive rewiring of the entire process. If we knew how to do that, we could inject heart genes into pigs and grow human hearts and other organs...But we can't figure out all the embryology stuff.    We're actually not even close to being able to do anything like that, I'd say MAYBE in 100 years, certainly no sooner.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	No.  It's a matter of vertebrate body plan.

AA11538887	Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Newton's laws of motion and gravity are still used today. Kepler used the precise measurements of Brahe to show that planets orbit the Sun in elliptical orbits and not circular orbits, although Brahe himself thought the Sun orbited the Earth. Newton's laws of motion and gravity explain why the planets orbit in elliptical paths. Copernicus thought the planets orbited the Sun in circular orbits, which we know now is not true, although he was closer to the truth than Ptolemy who thought the planets and Sun orbited Earth.|`|WPPIaLORaa	By far Newton's laws of mechanics are the most important.  They describe astronomical orbits, but they are also used in the everyday design of objects and processes that we use.  Newton's laws of mechanics work well except where velocities are near the speed of light which requires Einstein's special relativity,  or masses are so large that they bend space requiring Einstein's general relativity, or the particles are so small and isolated that they can only be described by quantum mechanics.|`|BsV2TQAvaa	I would pick Kwepler.

We do use a suit that is tied into the vital body systems so that ground control can monitor an astronaut's body systems. There is nothing that is, however, used to maintain health yet.

AA10622261	Carbon atoms being of the non metal type do not form ionic bonds with other non metal atoms whether these are also carbon atoms or some other kind eg hydrogen or oxygen. They form covalent bonds instead.    Here we have two identical atoms which means their electronegativity is the same so they will share electrons in a bond between them equally. So this bond can not be polarised, it is therefore non polar covalent.|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	Non-polar covalent|`|AA11605110	Non-Polar. Hydrogen bonds is when nearby hydrogen atoms attract eachother. Polar covalent is when the sharing of electrons is unequal. Typically it occurs when 1 atom is more electronegative than another. Water is an example of polar covalent. while methane is a good example of non-polar covalent. Think of someone who has bipolar disorder. They aren't quite equal in the brain dept.
FijSI1v2aa	Snow forms if the air in a cloud is below freezing. The water vapour then turns to ice instead of rain and the tiny ice crystals stick together until they form snowflakes. When they get heavy enough to fall, they drop out of the clouds. At this point though, we still dont know whether they will end up as rain or remain as snow. This depends on the temperature of the air they travel through on the way down to the ground. If it gets warmer, they turn into rain, but if the air stays close to freezing all the way down, then the snowflakes will make it without melting and so fall as snow. If this occurs in a mountain area, it is possible for snow to be falling on the mountaintop while lower down in the valley the air is warmer and so it is raining instead.|`|aBqJhdufaa	Instead of there being rain falling from it, it freezes up and falls to Earth as ice crystals|`|AA12035186	When someone does a snowdance.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	A snow cloud and a rain cloud are the same.

k5Ece8BTaa	Nope...    This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage?     ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes.   ? No coment will hit Earth or asteriods.  ? These cultures such as the Japanese, Mayans, Japanese or whoever didn't predict such a thing. As I just said, this is just a scam to make money off of ignorant people who don't look at the facts.  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|RSbn5STjaa	Yes - and there's nothing you can do about it.|`|Gem96NQyaa	Who cares?  If it does, there's nothing we can do to stop it, and nowhere we can go to escape it.

How about a show of hands ?|`|mxqAOxYRaa	Absolutely not. There is no solid reason for why this would happen, every possible reason is a theory which is always proved to be wrong. But if it is true, that means that we cannot escape nor hide nor stop it from happening, but the world will end eventually,but not in our generation, or anywhere in the near future generations.

i0ypGmlQaa	You can think of these as sequences of length n, instead of "positive integers less than 10^n."    So how many non-decreasing sequences are there?    You have a sequence like:    1 1 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 9    That's 11 digits long. In fact, we can write this sequence as:    a(1) = 1  a(2) = 1  a(3) = 3  ..etc    Then construct the sequence:  b(i) = a(i) + i - 1    In other words:  1 1 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 9  becomes:  1 2 3 5 7 9 11 12 14 16 19  [we increase each gap by 1]    Important: This process is reversible, thus we can simply count these kinds of sequences, instead of the original. This correspondence tells us they are the same number.    You need to figure out the number of increasing sequences of n "digits" where now we can use digits not from 0 to 9, but all the way up to 9+n-1 = 8+n, since that's what the last digit (at most) could be (instead of being capped at 9).    However, this is easy. They are all distinct numbers, n of them, going from at least 0 to at most n+8. That's n+9 things, and we're picking n of them.    Answer: (n+9)Cn - 1    There, C stands for "choose" as in binomial coefficients:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_co...    Notice this is the same, if it matters, as (n+9)C9 - 1    The -1 is because of zero. That is a single possibility that we just remove at the end, since technically, we could have a sequence like 0000000 in what we counted.    For small values n, we can check:    n=1  10C1 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9  That's obvious - any nonzero digit will work.    n=2, 11C2 - 1 = 55 - 1 = 54  This is also true. We simply have a pairing of each two digit number:  01  10  45  54  82  28  That's the ones with distinct digits (90 of them), and exactly half of those work. That gets us 45. Then we include 9 more for the repeated digit ones (not counting 00). 45+9 = 54.    n=3, 12C3 - 1 = 220  Here, it's a bit harder to see, but you could list them all if you want.

The trait might increase the probability of survival of the individual through reproductive age.  It might be useful in sexual selection.  It might increase resistance to disease.  It might increase the range of foodstuffs.  It might increase resistance to temperature changes.  And it might just happen randomly through genetic drift.|`|l4DAtTSHaa	This sounds like evolution where only the fit produce.

ZaSiPFvtaa	We should most definitely form a colony on the Moon, with at least 300 or so people, and eventually should do the same on Mars.    Why?  Simple:  a big asteroid or comet could smack into the earth, killing us, just as the dinosaurs were killed.  This could happen at any time, and we are NOT prepared for it.  If colonies existed on the Moon and/or Mars with sufficient populations, then they could wait for the "dust to clear," return at least part of their populations to Earth, and repopulate this planet, in the event of such a disaster on Earth.    Eventually, when the sun becomes a red giant, we'll have to move further out -- perhaps to moons of Jupiter or Saturn, or to other solar systems altogether.  A lunar colony would be engulfed by the expanding sun, along with the Earth.  A Martian colony might survive -- the jury is still out on just how big the red-giant version of the sun will be, at its largest.  We have literally billions of years(4.5 or so) before the sun goes red giant, however.    Obviously, I want our species to survive.  I want my genes carried along with it.  Hell, I want to go with it -- not wanting to die, I'm prepared to exist as a brain in a box on wheels, or (later) software in a sophisticated computer, if by such outlandish means I can delay what most people refer to as "the inevitable" (shudder).    I also believe we should be engaged in the exploration (with telescopes and the like, not physical probes -- they're too slow) of deep space, but my only justification here is simple curiousity, not the survival of our species.|`|PpuOab4Gaa	Well definite downsides are that it's expensive, and astronauts are losing their lives.

The breakdown voltage is specified as a voltage with a tolerance, such as 10 volts 5%, which means the breakdown voltage (or operating voltage) will be between 9.5 volts and 10.5 volts.    A signal diode or rectifier will have a high reverse breakdown, from 50 to 2000 volts, and is NOT designed to operate in the breakdown region. So exceeding the reverse voltage may result in the device being damaged. In addition, the breakdown voltage is specified as a minimum only.    Forward characteristics are similar to both, although the zener's forward characteristics is usually not specified, as the zener will never be used in that region. A signal diode or rectifier has the forward voltage specified as a max voltage at one or more current levels.    .|`|mjVymExBaa	While Billruss... has said it well technically, I would summarize that a zener is like a relief valve....

If you take the derivative of the position function with respect to time, you would get the velocity.  If you set this velocity to zero (when the Civic would not be moving) you can solve for t, or the time when the vehicle stops.  Hint: there is no negative time.  I am assuming this is the desired direction of this problem.    v(t) = 2*a*t - 3*B*t^2    setting this equation equal to zero, divide both sides by t, and add the 3*B part to both sides you get    3*B*t = 2*a    rearrange    t = (2*a)/(3*B)    substituting in the values for a and B...    t = 2.94/.165    t = 17.181818...s           I worked all that before your edit of the question, just use that v(t) equation to get the velocities at any instantaneous point in time for any t.  Average velocity would just be 1/2 the difference of any two velocities at the times required by the intervals.    a) 1/2*(v(0) + v(2.10)) Just plug times into  v(t) = 2*a*t - 3*B*t^2    etc.    Graphically you could get the instantaneous velocities from plotting this x(t) function and getting the slope at that point in time.  A constant acceleration means the velocity is always changing..

1SevO7siaa	I went to wikipedia and it explains alot about H2S. Check it out.    I think the earths temperature has alot to do with it.  Also Hydrogen sulfide is considered a broad-spectrum poison, meaning that it can poison several different systems in the body, although the nervous system is most affected. The toxicity of H2S is comparable with that of hydrogen cyanide. It forms a complex bond with iron in the mitochondrial cytochrome enzymes, thereby blocking oxygen from binding and stopping cellular respiration. Cellular repiration is how ATP is made and used up. ATP is short for energy. So if theres is no energy being created then life cannot be created!    I hope this helped, check out wikipedia though! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_su...      Another thing to add just for fun. There are deep sea vents in our oceans, the water is very acidic and scolding hot around the vents. (they reach about 350 degrees C) Its heated by geothermal activity. Hydrogen sulfide is actually spewed from the vents or "smokers". Since light does not penetrate the deep ocean floor organisms do not rely on photosynthesis, but instead a process called chemosynthesis. Micro organisms (bacteria that live in tube worms) are able to split the hydrogen sulfide molecules, the bacteria then capture the energy storred in the chemical bonds of the molecules. Sulfuric acid is produced as a bi-product of chemosynthesis.|`|SsdRuG00aa	no complex life forms would not have evolved. water (h20) contributes its oxygen atom during photosynthesis. it is split during the light dependent reactions of the process. i would expect only bacteria that can utilize the sulfur produced from splitting the hydrogen sulfide can evolve. most organisms require oxygen to live.

hVE0fWrvaa	This might seem hard at first glance but if you look closely most of the work has already been done for you. In most cases these problems will give you the amounts in grams. You would then need to convert the grams to moles and for that a balanced equation is needed.    In this case you already have the number of moles, which means you don't need to balance equations or convert grams to moles. All you need to do is look at which one is the lesser quantity. The lesser quantity of moles is your limiting reactant.    Good luck.
4fWZL4TRaa	The pressure is 1025kg/m^3, so 1025kg for each meter of depth per square meter.

Converting to other pressures:  psi = 156210kg/m^2 x 0.001 422 334 333 4  = 222psi  bar = 156210kg/m^2 x 0.000 098 066 5 = 15.318 bar  pascal = 156210kg/m^2 x  9.806 65 = 15.319 Mp  atmosphere = 156210kg/m^2 x  0.000 096 784 = 15.119 standard atmospheres where one standard atmosphere is 14.695 950 psi or 1013.25 millibar.

qBkJAlQ1aa	hmmn...are we talking about cylinders??    usually volume formulas that involves radius have it at radius^2  so if we increase the radius by 44%, the new radius becomes 1.44 times the original...  if we square 1.44 =>>  2.0736  this will render the new volume to be 2.0736 times the original or simply a little more the twice the original  if something increases to twice its original then it has increased by a hundred percent.    if its a sphere the volume increase is (~ 2.986  = r^3 = 1.44^3), which is almost times 3 -------> so the volume increase would be a liitle less than 200%    anvil ltd.|`|KblMZiHpaa	so the equation for a volume of a sphere is 4/3 * pi * r^3    so if you start out with a radius of 2 , the volume of the sphere would be:  V= (4/3) * (pi)* 2^3= 33.493333    now if you increase the radius by 44%, your new  radius would be given by (2*0.44)+2 =2.88    the new volume of the sphere would be given by:    V= (4/3) * (pi) * (2.88)^3 = 100.0155...

py39L7Wraa	first answer was no where helpful.     1. Write the balanced equation for the combustion of propane (C3H8) to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor    Combustion:   To balance a combustion equation do the following:  1. Balance the carbons on the left and right.  2. Balance the hydrogens left and right.  3. Count the number of oxygens on the right hand side divided by two and put the answer infront of the O2 on the left.  eg. C2H6 + 7/2 O2 -> 2CO2 + 3H2O  4. If a fractiun occurs multiply everything by two.  eg. 2C2H6 + 7O2 -> 4CO2 + 6H2O    propane + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water + ethane  C3H8 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O + C2H6  Final answer: 2C3H8 + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 2H2O + 2C2H6    2. Write the balance equation for the reaction between iron (III) chloride and sodium hydroxide.   the producers are iron (III) hydroxide and sodium chloride.  this is simple. the chloride is stronger than the OH, therefore it kicks him out. goes with the sodium. iron is left byself with OH and goes with OH. i want to believe you know how to write a chemical formula. if you need help with it, email me i'll see what i can do.    iron (III) chloride + sodium chloride -> iron(III) hydroxide + sodium chloride  FeCl3+ NaOH -> Fe(OH)3 + NaCl  Final answer: FeCl3+ 3NaOH -> Fe(OH)3 + 3NaCl    3. the double replacement reaction below results in the formation of the precipitate lead chloride.   Balance the equation and write the net ionic equationPb(NO3)2 (aq) + NH4CL(aq) yields PbCl2(s) + NH4NO3(aq)     Balanced equation:  Pb(NO3)2 (aq) + 2NH4CL(aq) -> PbCl2(s) + 2NH4NO3(aq)   Ionic equation:   (NO3)2 + Cl -> Cl2 + NO3 * (NO3)2 you need to put a negative on top of the two, Cl needs a negative at the top behind the l, Cl2 needs a negative at the top behind the l, NO3 needs a negative behind the O on top of the 3. the balanced equation, you need the charges for them. Pb is positive, NO3 is negative, NH4 is positive, Cl2 is negative. so just place negative and positive accordingly.    4. Identify the precipitate formed when solutions of the following ionic compounds are mixed. If no precipitates is formed, write no precipitate.   a. Zn(NO3)2 + SnCl2b.  b. KCl + AgNO3c.   c. Cu(NO3)2 + Na2Sd.   d. Al2(SO4)3 + 3Mg(OH)2     a.Zn(NO3)2 + SnCl2b. - zinc chloride, Sn(NO3)2  b. KCl + AgNO3c. - silver chloride, potassium nitrate  c. Cu(NO3)2 + Na2Sd. - sodium nitrate, CuSd  d. Al2(SO4)3 + 3Mg(OH) - aluminium hydroxide, magnesium sulphate.    sorry i can't say which will give a precipitate. but what i did was give the end products of the reaction. it's 3:20 a.m. now, and i would have completed it for you. but i need my sleep. what i would suggest you do is this, ask another chemistry teacher to explain it to you. or ask one of the strongest chem students in the class. it'll help you also, if you can get simple questions to work out. so hope you get your questions correct.|`|bimwlw0qaa	to achieve total randomness

NwbgvzfXaa	OK, here I go with my crazy imagination.    Everyone thinks that the when we see the moon, we are seeing sunlight being reflected off the moon's surface. That is incorrect.  Long ago, the sun god had one pet dragon and many pet rabbits. The pet dragon was always getting into trouble because he was always eating the rabbits. One day, the sun god decided to punish the pet dragon permanently. First, the sun god placed enough white colored rabbits on the moon to cover half of the surface. Then the sun god demanded that the dragon must carry the moon for all eternity. When the dragon gets hungry, he tries to catch the rabbits for his only source of food. But the rabbits just run as one large group around the surface of the moon to escape the dragon. Since the rabbits cover only half of the surface of the moon, when this group of rabbits run around the surface, it looks like the phases of the moon. For a full moon, the group is on the side facing the earth and all we see is their bright white fur. For a half moon, half of the group is on the back side of the moon and half is on the front side of the moon. For a new moon, the entire group is on the back side of the moon that faces away from earth and can't be seen.    How's that for a myth?|`|2kaKLBBHaa	The shadow of a great monster in the sky covers it.  Or a swarm of leeches crawls across the moon's surface.
SkG93Ybmaa	Fold moutains are actually formed by crust which have been uplifted and folded by compressional forces. This occurs along convergent plate boundaries where 2 plates move towards each other, between continental plates or between an oceanic and a continental plate. The crust and the rocks get bent and crumpled, and massive layers of Earth's crust gets uplifted as a result, forming spectacular fold mountains.|`|52f7584a0ca6651ca7209f1498e07a0caa	Those are mountains formed by the uplifting of the crust when two tectonic plates collide. The Andes & the Himalayas are good examples.|`|rw2TcmGIaa	Fold mountains are formed by Tectonic plate movement. They are found on Destructive and Collision plate boundaries where two continental or oceanic plates meet. The Pyrenees, Andies and Himalayas are all good examples.      There are things called Geosynclines which are layers of sediment compressed into rocks. When two tectonic plates move together these layers of sediment compress together and "fold" this creates fold mountains. As tectonic plates move closer together the mountains grow taller.  This also explains why half way up the side of the himalaya's there are fish fossils!

q40k1KTvaa	The first one kind of confuses me, but I know how the second one works, so I hope someone else can answer the first.     Here's how to do number two:  You start out with the formula:  C3H8 + O2 --> CO2 + H2O  then, you have to make sure each side is equal to balance it.   To do that, you have to look at one element at a time, but you must save oxygen for last.   So start out with C.   There are 3 on one side, 1 on the other. (the two is only for the O)  So to fix that, you must but a number 3 in front of the CO2.  So now it is:  C3H8 + O2 --> 3CO2 + H2O  Now, try the H. There are 8 on the first side, and 2 on the other.   So to fix that, you have to put a 4 in front of the H on the right side.  So now:  C3H8 + O2 --> 3CO2 + 4H2O  And now, finally, O. There are 2 on the right side, and 10 on the other.   Remember- the number you put in front of both the elements is multiplied by it's little number. So 3CO2 would equal 6, plus 4H2O would equal 4. So 6 + 4= 10.  Now we just need to fix the left side. So all you have to do, is put a 5 in front of the O2.   So the final answer is:   C3H8 + 5O2 --> 3CO2 + 4H2O    I really hope this helps. I don't know how well that was explained.|`|efe48b2704958e20b36597e1775c5058aa	1...Copper (I) is Cu(1+) ion and, Oxygen gas is O(2-) ion.

Capiche|`|aGOCX3o2aa	Ok start with your reactants: Cu+1 (you know it is plus 1 because it is copper (I)) and O2 (oxygen gas will always be with 2 oxygens it is called a diatomic gas) put these in the begining of the equation    Cu + O2 --->    now simply combine the 2 remembering thier charges: (it will take 2 Cu+ ions to bond with 1 O-2 ion:     Cu + O2 ---> Cu2O  to balance you make it so there are the same number of each atom on both sides. In this case:     2Cu + O2 ---> 2Cu2O    2. Simply make sure there are the same number of atoms on one side as the other. this is done basically by guess and check. HINT: it is never really a good idea to start by balancing hydrogen    C3H8 + 5O2 ---> 3CO2 + 4H2O     There are 6 C atoms, 8 H atoms and 10 O atoms on each side of the equation so therefore it is balanced.

ebuxHnScaa	You are correct that the integration is 3t^2/2 + 2t + C  But it's only 4 at t=1.    So:  3(1^2)/2 + 2(1) + C = 4  3/2 + 2 + C =4  C = 1/2    So speed = 3t^2/2 + 2t + 1/2    The position is the integral of speed. So integrating again:  (3/2) t^3/3 + 2 (t^2/2) + (1/2)t + C = p  t^3/2 + t^2 + t/2 + C = p    We are told that when t=1, the position is 6, so:  1/2 + 1 + 1/2 + C  = 6  2 + C = 6  C = 4    So at time 2, we have:  8/2 + 4 + 1 + 4 = p  4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = p  p = 13    And there's your answer.

Remember that (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2. Apply this to what you have.  y = 2(x2 + 2x + 1) - 4 - 2(1)  y = 2(x + 1)2 - 4 - 2(1)    Simplify the rest.  y = 2(x + 1)2 - 4 - 2  y = 2(x + 1)2 - 6     Remember that the vertex form is: y = a(x - h)2 + k.  This means that the vertex is at (-1, -6).    ANSWER: The vertex is at (-1, -6).    To find the zeroes, set the vertex form to 0 and solve.  2(x + 1)2 - 6 = 0  2(x + 1)2 - 6 + 6 = 0 + 6  2(x + 1)2 = 6  2(x + 1)2 / 2 = 6 / 2  (x + 1)2 = 3    Take the square root of both sides  (x + 1)2 = 3  x + 1 =  3  x + 1 - 1 = -1  3  x = -1  3    ANSWER: The zeroes are at x = -1  3.

You can multiply the length by the width and divide by 9 and that will give you the number of square yards in the room.  But, carpet normally comes in a 12 foot roll and in that room, it will have to be spliced.  You can't just splice the carpet in the manner which will have you buying the least amount of carpet.  The two pieces must run the same direction or the seam will be very obvious.  The carpet layer can cut the carpet so it runs across the 16'10" and then cut two more pieces which can be cut up into the necessary lengths to seam to complete your carpet.  One seam would run the 12' direction about 4 feet from one wall and that 4' piece would also have 3 seams in it.  You will still have some waste, and I don't know how to figure how much that would be.  With more waste, you can have fewer seams.

dZFwQPsGaa	It has to do with the mathematics of the models.  This is the whole nature of Chaos theory.  It is not random behavior, but it looks like it is.  There can be a certain level of predictability with these systems, but in comes more in the nature of probabilities rather than absolutes.    Linear systems, although they can be quite complex, can easily be broken down into smaller parts, and those parts can be looked at individually, and put back into the whole to understand the system.    We can't do that with non-linear systems.  If we look at one part, it is connected to several other parts, and you can't really analyze each part separately.  That makes it really hard to figure out what's going on.|`|xXOnjDNOaa	In a linear system, a change in one variable causes an effect that is directly proportional to that change. I.e. if the temperature going up 1 degree causes the wind to increase 3 mph, then the temperature going up 2 degrees would cause it to go up 6 mph.  However, in the weather, it's not that simple, sometimes small changes have very large effects, sometimes not so much.  Finding the full relationship between causes and effects can be very very difficult, and any slight error in measurement or prediction can quickly propagate to a large error in prediction.  This is why even the best weather forecasts are only correct up to a few days in advance.
1SevO7siaa	Ill help as much as i can!     1. When a substance absorbs light its absorbing all wavelengths of visible light. For example Green leaves absorbed all colors except green. Its confusing to understand. They appear green because the chlorophyll in leaf cells reflect green/yellow light therefore the light that reaches your eyes is green (cuz its reflected) and the rest of the Colors are absorbed. ( ROY G BIV---> red orange yellow green blue Violet)    2. Step1. When the electron leaves the reaction centre in photostem II and goes to the electron acceptor, the reaction centre is messing an electron. This electron must be replaced before photosten II can absorb more light energy to excite an electron. The source for the new electron is a water molecule. A water molecule is split in a series of reactions that releases electrons, hydrogen ions, and oxygen atoms. The oxygen that is released by plants comes form these watter-splitting reactions.  Step 2. From the electron-acceptor, the energized electron is transferred along a series of electron carrying molecules. Together, these molecules are referred to as an electron transport system. With each transfer along the electron transport system, the electron releases a small amount of energy. This released energy is used to push hydrogen ions from the stroma, across the thylakoid membrane, and into the thylakoid space- the area inside the thylakoid. The energy that is released as an electron is passed through the electron transport system (ETS) is storred temporarily in an hydrogen ion concentartion gradient across the thylakoid membrane. There are many more hydrogen ions in the thylakiod space then there are in teh stroma. You can compare thi concentration gradient to water behind a dam. Energy is storred in the potential energy of the water. In a dam the energy is used by allowing the water to flow down and turn turbines that will generate electric energy. In the Hydrogen ion gradient, the energy will be used to generate ATP (energy) from ADP and free phosphate groups.  Step3. When the events of step 1 and 2 are taking place light energy is absorbed by photostem I. This energy is transferred to a reaction centre, where an electron becomes excited. Once again the excited electron is passed to a high-energy electron-acceptor. In photostem I the lost electron is replaced by an electron that has reached teh end of the ETS from photostem II.  Last step! Step 4. The electron that was recieved by the electron-acceptor from photostem I is used to reduce NADP+ to form NADPH. The reducing power of NADPH wil be used un the light independent reactions.    Woah, that was alot.    4. The reaction formula for photosynthesis is 6H2O(water) + 6CO2 (carbon dioxide)------->(    you need water and carbon dioxide to start the reaction the the sun light "triggers" teh reaction and produces the 2 products glucose and oxygen.  As for cellular respiration its teh exact opposite!! Just reverse the equation    Cellular respiration equation:  C6H12O6 + 6O2------->6CO2 + 6H2O.    They differ in the order. The reverse of photosynthesis is cellular respiration... vise-versa.     I hope that helped you out alot!!!

Thus 1=A(1+1+1)+(B+C)(1-1) and A=13.   Let x=0. Then 0=13(0+0+1)+(B . 0 + C)(0 - 1),andC = 1/3.  Finally let x=-1. Then -1=13(1)+(B(-1)+13)(-2), or -2B=-23 so that B=-13.

97002d8c34e920580d103a2bd075b992aa	are you doing reverse transcriptase or real time PCR?      Anyways this shouldn't be a problem since the RT-viral polymerase operates at low temperatures anyways.  What i usually do is only use one primer to generate my ss cDNA.  Then i use the cDNA as template with both primers in a regular PCR or Real Time PCR if i want to quanitate it.  In your PCR (not RT), given those Tm, i would have an annealing temp of about 55C.  This should be more than enough for both primers to bind properly    RT PCR is a one time run.  It only generate one strain cDNA per template so you would not be able to see it on the gel!!!!!!!!  It generally operates at 37C or 25C depending on the polymerase used.      Also, whats your 5' to 3' delta G ratio?  The 5' has to be about 1.3 time higher (more negative) than the 3'.  I usually use netprimer for these calculations.  It has never failed me yet.  Plus you want to have your primer dimers to have a lower delta G (more positive) than -5 kcal/mole to avoid primer dimers.    http://www.premierbiosoft.com/netprimer/...|`|065c4ccb1266446bb12d60c809e0641daa	whoa, that's a big temperature gap....u should have used a different primer set....    i think it's standard practice to go with the lower of the two, but it still may not work...is there any way to use a different reverse primer...perhaps one that isn't so GC rich??    ...to your response....  yeah, i think that's probably the best bet...it's going to be hard to get ANYTHING to work at 79 degrees...are u sure you did the calculation right???  that foward primer looks good...you just may need to get a new reverse primer|`|0332a5aa31c2c09970bfbfeabdd45711aa	Huh ??????????????????????????????
065c4ccb1266446bb12d60c809e0641daa	Knudson's two hit hypothesis works well here.  Say for example you have a germ-line mutation that makes you heterozygous for the BRCA1 gene.  if something else happens in your lifetime that creates a mutation in your "good copy" of BRCA1, then the gene will now be mutated, and you will have no functioning BRCA1 (this is often called a "loss of heterozygosity"--which can also occur via translocation, deletion, etc.)...that is step 1.  this has to happen multiple times with many different genes (as there has not been discovered merely a single gene that causes cancer)...but IF this were to happen multiple times, perhaps with BRCA1, BRCA2, p53, etc.  then you would develop cancer...    hope this is along the lines of what you were looking for...

Os defeitos fsicos que j aparecem ao nascimento s?o chamados congnitos e podem ser hereditrios ou n?o hereditrios.  Os hereditrios s?o decorrentes de altera??es gen?micas que ocorrem no DNA, na forma de dele??es cromoss?micas, transloca??es, duplica??es, etc, os quais levam a defeitos muitas vezes caractersticos (por exemplo,  a trissomia do cromossomo 21 levando  sndrome de Down, a trissomia do 18 com a sndrome de Edwards e a do 13, sndrome de Patau). Esses defeitos podem occorer na divis?o das clulas que originar?o os espermatozides ou vulos, ou j estarem presentes nas clulas do pai ou m?e e estes nem apresentavam caractersticas clnicas em suas vidas.

k5Ece8BTaa	Why do you assume that I believe the world won't end in 2012? I don't even come close to believing the world will end in 2012.    This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage?     ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes.   ? No coment will hit Earth or asteriods.  ? These cultures such as the Japanese, Mayans, Japanese or whoever didn't predict such a thing. As I just said, this is just a scam to make money off of ignorant people who don't look at the facts.  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|mxqAOxYRaa	I don't. There is no solid reason for why this would happen, every possible reason is a theory which is always proved to be wrong.

This is a prediction also, and yeah maybe it will happen, but a lot of predictions that have been made have been false. Supposedly the earth is going to tilt, or wobble, I have heard that the earth has been tilting.

See you in 2013|`|k5Ece8BTaa	Nope...    This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage?     ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes.   ? No comment will hit Earth or asteriods.  ? These cultures such as the Japanese, Mayans, Japanese or whoever didn't predict such a thing. As I just said, this is just a scam to make money off of ignorant people who don't look at the facts.  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|kRbkiPvnaa	No,  There have been doomsday prophecies for thousands of years,  the 2012 story is just a myth.

cqLYkuz8aa	Fish breathe oxygen that is dissolved in the water. The gills of the fish "filter out" this dissolved oxygen and that is how they breathe.    While it is true that a water molecule is made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, fish do not split water molecules to atomic form in order to breathe.     Basic chemistry: hydrogen is a gas. If fish were splitting water molecules into two gases, their ponds would disappear. Additionally, oxygen in its elemental form is O2 and hemoglobin binds to O2, not O which is what you would get from splitting a water molecule.|`|TMB4d3FAaa	They get it from the dissolved oxygen in the water. If they were getting it by splitting H20 we could crowd a huge number of fish into a mammoth aquarium and get all the hydrogen we needed to run our hybrid autos. When the lake is frozen and no more oxygenated water is available, if they use up the 02 they suffocate. Often you will see lots of dead fish in the spring time near small ponds etc that have died in this manner. When I was a  youngster living in Currie, Mn. we had a gravel pit that held water maybe 8 foot deep.  The bullheads would keep an opening in the ice and come to the surface to gulp air from outside the pond to obtain the needed oxygen. They'd survive even though the ice in nearby lakes was 18 thick and the oxygen in the water was depleted.. Being cold blooded, the fish's metabolism slows considerably when the temperature of the water drops. If you do any ice fishing you will notice how sluggish they are then.  They bite slower , run with less vigor and move much slower when hoisted onto the ice.  If you keep them from freezing to death on the ice, they live a lot longer out of the water in winter than they do in warmer weather. When you see people with air hoses or water fountains being left on in winter it is to introduce 02 into the water.   That way they will still have fish come spring. With the slower metabolism they use a lot less 02. With no dissolved 02 there are no more fish but, you'll still have plenty of water left in the pond..|`|z7JsVzcnaa	From the water as one of the components of water is oxygen.  That's where they get all their oxygen.|`|LMaP6flQaa	Its not like the air goes through the water to the fish.

HwdI7hVvaa	Change in potential energy = minus of work done by electric field on the electron.  Electron is negatively charged. Therefore electric force on electron is opposite to electric field.  But electron is moving in the same direction as the electric field. Therefore force and displacement are in opposite directions.  Therefore work done by electric field is negative.  Therefore change in potential energy is positive.  Therefore the electron's potential energy increases.    By conservation of energy, the electron's kinetic energy decreases. Therefore its speed decreases.|`|bgZvfmRpaa	visit www.assignmenthelp.net for solutions|`|6aBvgvvYaa	Since the electron is traveling in the direction  of the electric field:  It's potential energy increases.

1ApjsB7Naa	Recall that Euler's formula gives us the following wonderful identity:    exp(i*theta) = cos(theta) + i*sin(theta)    Using this identity, your expression becomes    [ cos(theta) + i * sin(theta) ] + [ cos(-theta) + i * sin(-theta) ].    Now, cos is an odd function; that is, cos(x) = cos(-x). On the other hand, sin is an even function; that is, sin(x) = -sin(x). Therefore, this previous expression reduces to    [ cos(theta) + i * sin(theta) ] + [ cos(theta) - i * sin(theta) ].    Simplifying gives    2 * cos(theta).    In other words,     exp(i * theta) + exp(i * -theta) = 2 * cos(theta).    In the form x + i * y, we have x = 2 * cos(theta) and y = 0.

ezizt5buaa	I assume you have a rectangle with these sides?    To find the area--as you seem to know--you multiply length by width.  I'm guessing you are having trouble with the fractions.  Fractions are just parts of whole numbers.    Remember back when you first learned multiplication?  If you were doing 3 x 5, you might draw a field of corn or something...  three rows of five plants in each.  You could count them up and get 15.    Imagine the same thing.  Imagine you have rows of glasses of milk.  You have 3? rows.  In each row, there are 5? glasses.  Think about this.  Draw row 1.  There are 5 full glasses in row 1 and one glass ? full.  Row 2 is the same way.  Row 3 is the same way.  Now the next row is a half row.  The first glass is ? full.  So are the second, third, fourth, and fifth.  That last, sixth glass, is only 1/8 full (half of ?).  If you can draw this, you can see how all the fractions add up.    Another way to think of this is to remember that mixed numbers (like 3?) are really addition.  3? = 3 + ?.    And remember that fractions basically mean divide.  ? = 1 divided by 2.  ? means 1 divided by 4.    The easy way to solve this problem is to rewrite the mixed numerals as fractions.    If fractions just mean divide, then we can do this:    3? = 3 + ?  3 + ? = 6/2 + 1/2  3? = 7/2    And we can do this:    5? = 5 + ?  5 + ? = 20/4 + 1/4  5? = 21/4    Now you can multiply a little easier:    7/2 x 21/4     (just multiply the numerators and the denominators)    147/8           (now simplify it)    18 3/8|`|6idi2E7caa	Area = length X width    So, 3.5 X 5.25 = 18.375 sq|`|ngfPNolpaa	(7/2)(21/4) = 84/8 = 10 1/2|`|vMpNfWqAaa	Written by Lee Jie Dog, Singapore, Raffles Institution  DOG x dog =DdOoGg bcos i am lee jie doggy style call me pls  answer is 7/2x21/4=i am a dog|`|jumISG9laa	all u do is multiply 3.5 x 5.25=18.375 or 7/2 x 21/4=147/8 = 18 3/8|`|sZR0oW0taa	(3 1/2)(5 1/4)  = [(2 x 3 + 1)/2][(4 x 5 + 1)/4]  = [7/2][21/4]  = (7 x 21)/(2 x 4)  = 147/8  = 18 3/8
rvzkotf5aa	A vector is a quantity which has not only a magnitude, but also a direction.  In physics, vectors are used extensively when dealing with forces and other quantities.  For example, an object may be subject to several different amounts of force from several different directions.  Using vectors, one may compute a net force which is the vector sum of all the individual forces.  The vector sum will also have a magnitude and direction.  Another example would be a plane or anything else moving at some velocity from east to west.  The velocity would be the magnitude, and west would be the direction of the vector describing the plane's motion.|`|sR4HjV9Paa	Velocity is a vector quantity, having magnitude expressed in speed, and direction.  Speed is a scalar quantity, having only magnitude.  Acceleration is another example of a vector quantity.    Physics is a particularly fascinating science.

1ApjsB7Naa	First isolate the exponential (that is, the term e^(2c)) by adding 1 to both sides:    e^(2c) = b + 1.    Now, recall the following important property of the functions e^x and ln(x): e^x is the inverse of ln(x), which means that e^(ln(x)) = x and that ln(e^x) = x.    This suggests that, in particular, ln(e^(2c)) = 2c. Therefore, take the natural logarithm of both sides (the ln is one-to-one, so this is justified):    2c = ln(b + 1)    Now just divide by 2! Your final answer is    c = 1/2 ln(b + 1).    Alternatively, perhaps by writing "e^2c-1" you actually meant e^(2c - 1). Parentheses matter! In this case, you would merely take the natural logarithm of both sides to obtain    2c - 1 = ln(b).    Now add 1 both sides and divide by 2 to finish this off:    c = 1/2 (ln(b) + 1)    Hope this helps!|`|F3lyP5XLaa	The theorem is usually formulated for closed paths as follows: let U be an open subset of C which is simply connected, let f : U  C be a holomorphic function, and let  be a rectifiable path in U whose start point is equal to its end point.

Electromagnetic radiation in the frequencies of radio waves can be detected by both their electric field (they induce voltage on any wire hung out in space) and they can be detected by the magnetic field they carry (or consist of) because they induce voltage into a coil of wire as they go by.

Triboluminescence is the creation of light by friction. This was first studied by Sir Francis Bacon about 400 years ago, even before the wintergreen Lifesaver was invented. It turns out that lots of things can glow when friction is applied. If you look closely, quickly stripping a roll of tape can cause a faint blue glow to appear.    It turns out that sugar is triboluminescent. When you crush sugar crystals, because of their irregular crystal structure, the breaking of the sugar crystals produces fragments that are positively and negatively charged. This separation of charge can become great enough to create small sparks to jump through the air. This is like how lightning occurs between the ground and the clouds, except on a much, much smaller scale ? you?re not going to be able to reanimate dead flesh by stomping on a few sugar packets.    Normally, when you crush sugar, these small sparks excite nitrogen molecules in the air, which subsequently emit mostly ultraviolet light. We can see only a small amount of this light, emitted as a faint bluish glow. Most candies should be capable of this, though it is really hard to see.    However, if you?ve gone off and tried the wintergreen Lifesaver experiment, you?ll notice that the Lifesavers produce a pretty bright flash of light. Obviously, there is something special about the wintergreen Lifesavers which makes them so much brighter. That special something is methyl salicylate, which gives it the wintergreen flavor. Methyl salicylate, it turns out, can absorb the ultraviolet light given off by the nitrogen, and re-emit it as visible light. This is what makes the wintergreen Lifesavers so much cooler (pun totally intended and planned for paragraphs in advance).|`|AA12326949	When you chew on the lifesavers, you increase the energy of the sugar molecules in the candy.  They release this extra energy as light.  This process is called triboluminescence.  You can see this effect with a lot of other objects, including sticky tape.    It will happen in any sugar-based candy, but the light is particularly bright in wintergreen-flavoured candies as an element of the wintergreen flavour (methyl salicylate, from memory) absorbs the light emitted by the sugar molecules and re-emits it at a different wavelength that is more visible to the human eye.

Since the gravity pull is so strong nothing can escape, not even light. When a Black hole meets a white hole, they form wormholes and this may be the secret to time travel.|`|AA10650214	Event Horizons  The event horizon is the point outside the black hole where the gravitational attraction becomes so strong that the escape velocity (the velocity at which an object would have to go to escape the gravitational field) equals the speed of light. Since according to the relativity theory no object can exceed the speed of light, that means that nothing, not even light, could escape the black hole once it is inside this distance from the center of the black hole. A more fundamental way of viewing this is that in a black hole the gravitational field is so intense that it bends space and time around itself so that inside the event horizon there are literally no paths in space and time that lead to the outside of the black hole: No matter what direction you went, you would find that your path led back to the center of the black hole, where the singularity is found.   Black Holes and the Speed of Light  Black holes almost certainly exist, and one of their basic properties is that they trap light. However, it is also true that nothing exceeds the speed of light. In fact, the theoretical prediction of black holes is due to the General Theory of Relativity, which is built on the principle that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant. The analogy of a cannonball falling back to Earth with the trapping of light in a black hole is only a crude and suggestive one that is not correct at a fundamental level (for one thing, the cannonball has mass, but light does not; it turns out that this difference is critical, because massless particles MUST travel at light velocity, but massive particles CANNOT travel at light velocity).   To understand fully why a black hole can trap light but the light still always travels at constant velocity requires an understanding of the General Theory of Relativity, but the essential point is that the black hole curves spacetime back on itself, so that all paths in the interior of the black hole lead back to the singularity at the center, no matter which direction you go (an analogy in two dimensions is that no matter which direction you go on the surface of the Earth in a "straight line" (what mathematicians call a "geodesic" or a "great circle"), you never escape the Earth but instead return to the same point. Imagine extending that analogy to the 4 dimensions of spacetime and you have a rough explanation for why light travels at light speed, but cannot escape the interior of a black hole.     Singularities Clothed and Naked  The singularity is the point of infinite density thought to exist at the center of a black hole. We have no way of understanding what would happen in the vicinity of a singularity, since in essence nature divides our equations by zero at such a point, and you probably learned some time in math class that you cannot divide by zero and get sensible mathematics. There is an hypothesis, called the "Law of Cosmic Censorship" that all singularities in the Universe are contained inside event horizons and therefore are in principle not observable (because no information about the singularity can make it past the event horizon to the outside world). However, this is an hypothesis, not rigorously proven, so it is conceivable that so-called "Naked Singularities" might exist, not clothed by an event horizon. If such were the case, we can only guess at this point what that would imply for physics near such an object.   Violence in the Cosmos Black Holes       Black Holes in Binary Star Systems  It is thought that in some binary systems one of the stars is a black hole. Although the black hole cannot be seen directly, it can signal its presence if matter accretes from the other star into the black hole. The matter falling into the black hole is likely to form an accretion disk.   As the matter in the accretion disk loses energy and spirals downward into the black hole it is heated to very high temperatures and emits X-rays. Generally, any binary star system in which there is a strong X-ray source and in which one of the stars is not seen but is very massive is a good candidate for a black hole.     Identification of Cygnus X-1     Black Hole Accretion     The compact star in an accreting binary system may also be a black hole. Accretion onto a black hole will look similar in many respects to accretion onto a neutron star or white dwarf. The adjacent figure is a ROSAT X-ray image of LMC X-1, a binary system in the Large Magellanic Cloud in which one star is a more normal star and one is estimated to have a mass of 5 solar masses or more and therefore is likely to be a black hole (Source).   The diffuse glow is X-ray emission in the vicinity of the binary (which isn't seen in the image). X-rays from the accretion disk of the binary knock electrons off atoms in a volume of space that may be light years in diameter. These atoms emit X-rays when the electrons re-combine, causing the observed glow. The following table lists candidates black holes in some binary systems.

At this point, both space and time stop. It's very hard for us to imagine a place where mass has no volume and time does not pass, but that's what it is like at the center of a black hole.    The point at the center of a black hole is called a singularity. Within a certain distance of the singularity, the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing--not even light--can escape. That distance is call the event horizon. The event horizon is not a physical boundary but the point-of-no-return for anything that crosses it. When people talk about the size of a black hole, they are referring to the size of the event horozon. The more mass the singularity has, the larger the event horizon. The structure of a black hole is something like this:    Many people think that nothing can escape the intense gravity of black holes. If that were true, the whole Universe would get sucked up. Only when something (including light) gets within a certain distance from the black hole, will it not be able to escape. But farther away, things do not get sucked in. Stars and planets at a safe distance will circle around the black hole, much like the motion of the planets around the Sun. The gravitational force on stars and planets orbiting a black hole is the same as when the black hole was a star because gravity depends on how much mass there is--the black hole has the same mass as the star, it's just compressed.    Black holes are truly black. Light rays that get too close bend into, and are trapped by the intense gravity of the black hole. Trapped light rays will never escape. Since black holes do not shine, they are difficult to detect.    also you might want to know the following:    Neutron Stars and Pulsars  Neutron stars are very dense and spin very fast and are typically only 10- 15 km in radius. Because neutron stars form from burnt-out stars, they do not glow. The collapse of the star causes the matter to be converted into mostly neutrons, hence the name neutron star.    Some neutron stars emit radio waves that pulse on and off. These stars are called pulsars. Pulsars don't really turn radio waves on and off--it just appears that way to observers on Earth because the star is spinning. What happens in that the radio waves only escape from the North and South magnetic poles of the neutron star. If the spin axis is tilted with respect to the magnetic poles, the escaping radio waves sweep around like the light beam from a lighthouse. Far away on Earth, radio astronomers pick up the radio waves only when the beam sweeps across the Earth.    These pictures are based on a drawing in Zeilik, M. and J. Gaustad. Astronomy: The Cosmic Perspective. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc, 1990, p 544.    How Black Holes and Neutron Stars Form  Black holes and neutron stars form when stars die. While a staris burning, the heat in the star pushes out and balances the force of gravity. When the star's fuel is spent, and it stops burning, there is no heat left to counteract the force of gravity. Whatever material is left over collapses in on itself. How much mass the star had when it died determines what it becomes. Stars about the same size as the Sun become white dwarfs, which glow from left over heat. Stars that have about 3 times the mass of the Sun compact into neutron stars. And a star with mass greater than 3 times the Sun's gets crushed into a single point, which we call a black hole.    Supernovae  A supernova explosion is usually associated with the formation of black holes and neutron stars. To understand what explodes and what collapses, we need to talk about what happens during a supernova explosion.    Young stars are hydrogen, and the nuclear reaction converts hydrogen to helium with energy left over. The left over energy is the star's radiation--heat and light. When most of the hydrogen has been converted to helium, a new nuclear reaction begins that converts the helium to carbon, with the left over energy released as radiation. This process continues converting the carbon to oxygen to silicon to iron. Nuclear fusion stops at iron. If you could slice a very old star in half, it may look (sort of) like this:    The star has layers of different elements. The outer layers of hydrogen, helium, carbon, and silicon are still burning around the iron core, building it up. Eventually, the massive iron core succumbs to gravity and it collapses to form a neutron star. The outer layers of the star fall in and bounce off the neutron core which creates a shock wave that blows the outer layer outward. This is the supernova explosion.    How We Detect Black Holes and Neutron Stars  Black holes and neutron stars don't give off light, so we can't just look for them. However, astronomers can find black holes and neutron stars by observing the gravitational effects on other objects nearby.    X-rays  Astronomers can discover some black holes and neutron stars because they are sources of x-rays. The intense gravity from a black hole or a neutron star will pull in dust particles from a surrounding cloud of dust or a nearby star. As the particles speed up and heat up, they emit x-rays. So the x-rays don't come directly from the black hole or neutron star, but from its effect on the dust around it. Although x-rays don't penetrate our atmosphere, astronomers use satellites to observe x-ray sources in the sky.    Rotating stars  Many stars rotate around each other, much as the planets orbit our Sun. When astronomers see a star circling around something, but they cannot see what that something is, they suspect a black hole or a neutron star.    Gravity lenses  Astronomers use a technique called gravity lensing to search for black holes and neutr|`|6df7408e75717fd47b0fc4ae4d16ba62aa	hole in a space with very high gravitational force  even light do not escape from its force  or may be a way to a time travel or other universe|`|6c2a5f27fa42de7404021976940b828daa	A black hole is a region of spacetime from which nothing can escape, even light. ...

Black holes are the objects of such immense mass and pressure inside of them that it creates a gravitational field around it, called "event horizon",  so strong that not even light could escape.  For example, the earth is a planet, but when you compress the current mass of the earth to a single dot, which is called the singularity, you would create a massive black hole.    Black holes cannot be seen because of light's inability to escape through , yet they could be detected through X-rays they emit because of the massive consumption of matter in it's core.  The infinite mass of a black hole follows Einstein's theory of relativity, once you enter the event horizon, time will be extremely slowed and space would be distorted. You will see lights from other stars repetitively as though there were mirrors in every direction and after some "time" you will fall to the singularity and yes, you'll die.    A distant observer in a safe distance might see you falling  through a dark space, but not see you where you really are. Once you're outside the event horizon, that will be the last thing that your friend might see of you. He will see you stuck in there forever and not moving because light itself is stuck because of the gravity and continuously reflects the last image formed in your eye.     The Singularity is the central core of a black hole, a dreaded 0 dimension where space-time is distorted tremendously and infinite mass. Many speculations arise of the existence of a white hole, where matter is spat out from what the black hole has sucked forming a "worm hole."  But such existence were disproved by the laws of physics and no such thing has been detected in the universe|`|6476bf4b625fb8e705c903e746030e49aa	Astronomers believe that black holes are created when extremely large stars collapse upon themselves.  They are seen through telescopes as a dark area in the night sky.  They have enormous gravitational pull.  Some scientists believe that the physical size of the collapsed star at the center may be as small as a basketball or even a marble.  The mass of the former star does not change, however.  There are many questions about black holes which may long remain a mystery, because even light does not escape from a black hole. For more info... try Wikipedia:)|`|AA11817520	A black hole is a concentration of mass great enough that the force of gravity prevents anything past its event horizon from escaping it, except through quantum tunnelling behaviour (known as Hawking radiation). The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity past its event horizon exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, inside the event horizon can escape its gravity. It is, however, theorized that wormholes can provide an exit path for energy or matter. The term "black hole" is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return.    The existence of black holes in the universe is well supported by astronomical observation, particularly from studying X-ray emission from X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.    History  In the 1970s, science historians discovered a letter dated 1784 from John Michell, a natural philosopher and geologist, to scientist Henry Cavendish[1], in which he considers the effect of a heavenly object massive enough to prevent light from escaping. This letter has been considered to be the first prediction of a black hole,[2] though Laplace also mentioned a star with similar features before this time.    The concept of a body so massive that not even light could escape was put forward by the English geologist John Michell in a 1783 paper sent to the Royal Society. At that time, the Newtonian theory of gravity and the concept of escape velocity were well known. Michell computed that a body with 500 times the radius of the Sun and of the same density would have, at its surface, an escape velocity equal to the speed of light, and therefore would be invisible. In his words:    If the semi-diameter of a sphere of the same density as the Sun were to exceed that of the Sun in the proportion of 500 to 1, a body falling from an infinite height towards it would have acquired at its surface greater velocity than that of light, and consequently supposing light to be attracted by the same force in proportion to its vis inertiae (inertial mass), with other bodies, all light emitted from such a body would be made to return towards it by its own proper gravity.    Although he thought it unlikely, Michell considered the possibility that many such objects that cannot be seen might be present in the cosmos.    In 1796, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace promoted the same idea in the first and second edition of his book Exposition du Systeme du Monde. It disappeared in later editions. The whole idea gained little attention in the 19th century, since light was thought to be a massless wave, not influenced by gravity.    In 1915, Einstein developed the theory of gravity called General Relativity. Earlier he had shown that gravity does influence light. A few months later, Karl Schwarzschild gave the solution for the gravitational field of a point mass, showing that something we now call a black hole could theoretically exist. The Schwarzschild radius is now known to be the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, but this was not well understood at that time. Schwarzschild himself thought it was not physical. In a remarkable coincidence, the name Schwarzschild actually translates into black shield.    In the 1920s, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar argued that special relativity demonstrated that a non-radiating body above 1.44 solar masses, now known as the Chandrasekhar limit, would collapse since there was nothing known at that time that could stop it from doing so. His arguments were opposed by Arthur Eddington, who believed that something would inevitably stop the collapse. Both were correct, since a white dwarf more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a neutron star. However, a neutron star above about three solar masses will itself become unstable against collapse due to similar physics.    In 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and H. Snyder predicted that massive stars could undergo a dramatic gravitational collapse. Black holes could, in principle, be formed in nature. Such objects for a while were called frozen stars since the collapse would be observed to rapidly slow down and become heavily redshifted near the Schwarzschild radius. The mathematics showed that an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where it crosses that radius. However, these hypothetical objects were not the topic of much interest until the late 1960s. Most physicists believed that they were a peculiar feature of the highly symmetric solution found by Schwarzschild, and that objects collapsing in nature would not form black holes.    Interest in black holes was rekindled in 1967 because of theoretical and experimental progress. Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose proved that black holes are a generic feature in Einstein's theory of gravity, and cannot be avoided in some collapsing objects. Interest was renewed in the astronomical community with the discovery of pulsars. Shortly thereafter, the use of the expression "black hole" was coined by theoretical physicist John Wheeler,[3] being first used in his public lecture Our Universe: the Known and Unknown on 29 December, 1967. The older Newtonian objects of Michell and Laplace are often referred to as "dark stars" to distinguish them from the "black holes" of general relativity.

For a 10:1 reduction in the data record, you need to apply a digital anti-aliasing filter. Then decimation in time to cull the unwanted interstitial points.    For example, in your example, take your 5000 data points and run it through a low pass filter with a digital bandwidth of 0.09*pi radians and with a stop band attenuation of at least 80dB, then take every 10th point and put it in your new array. You will end up with 500 points that preserves as much information about the original record as can be achieved.    Another way to do this is to take an FFT of the points and apply and inverse-FFT to the fraction that constitutes the lowest frequencies. Easier to do when working with record lengths on powers of 2    For example, take 8192 points, perform an FFT on them. Keep the first 512 points and the last 512 points and mash them together to make a 1024 point record. Then shove that through an inverse-FFT to get a 1024 point compressed record of the original 8192 point record.|`|AA11558753	not into java or c  but i can di it in php

AA12329725	OK .....    Base Oils : Usually used to denote lubricant basestocks used in the manufacture of automotive, industrial and turbine oils. Such oils are usually solvent refined and dewaxed and are designated as :    AXXXSUS    where  A stands for Automotive XXX = viscosity grade in Saybolt Universal Seconds @ 40C.    eg A300SUS = Automotive Oil with a viscosity of 300 SUS @ 40C    or    TXXXSUS where T stands for Turbine    Turbine stocks are usually more highly refined, either by "deep dewaxing", catalytic dewaxing or light hydrotreating.    There is also "Brightstock" which is a "heavy end" paraffinic stock used mostly in gear oils.     Base oils are (usually) paraffinic in nature, although napthenic and aromatic oils also exist.    Naphthenic stocks are usually refered to as "Pale Oils". They are commonly used in transformer oils and some agricultural applications.    White Oils are paraffinic or naphthenic stocks that have been "super refined" - before the advent of "severe hydrotreating" this was done by treatment with sulphuric acid. The reaction between the aromatic and olefinic components of the oil produced petroleum sulphonates (the early detergents) and left an oil that, after redistillation and treatment with activated clay, was absolutely colourless (hence "white" oils). The standard tests for a white oil include, not suprisingly, its lack of reactivity to concentrated sulphuric acid (everything that could react has!) and no fluoresence under UV light (a test for the presence of olefins and aromatics). More recently these oils are produced using high temp/high pressure hydrotreating. This process converts unsaturated and aromatic compounds to their equivalent paraffins and naphthenes. It also removes sulphur and a variety of other impurities. The oils produced by this method are unbelievably pure.    "Slack Wax" is wax containing a high percentage of entrained oil (typically between 10 - 40%) and is the first stage in "dewaxing" of base stocks.    When lube oil is being refined, it is first recovered from crude by atmospheric distillation removing all the light ends, then by vacuum distillation to remove the lube oils leaving a bottoms tar (asphaltenes/bitumen).    The lube oil "cut" is further refined - firstly to remove entrained asphaltenes (propane deasphalting), then to remove aromatics  and olefins(furfural or NMP extraction), then finally by MEK/Toluene dewaxing. The byproduct of the MEK/Toluene dewaxing process is "slackwax" - crude wax with entrained oil. Most refineries try to recover more oil from the slackwax by retreating it through the dewaxer, creating more pure wax and more baseoil.|`|AA10531992	here are a few of your oils:  http://www.candlecauldron.com/waxandwick...
95f0ff27248691f9d05ec28f56de48cdaa	 uma quest?o de desentendimento quando da cria??o de tecnologia nova. No inicio da implanta??o da energia eltrica, alguma Companinhas adotaram 110V outras 220V e depois  ficou difcil mudar.   Qual a melhor tens?o eletrica? Para ligarmos um chuveiro de 4400W de totncia em 110 Volts precisamos de condutores que suportem 40 Ampres ou seja, fio de 10 mm2. Para fazermos o mesmo em rede de 220 v , os condutores devem suportar 20 Ampres e para isso fios de 2,5 mm2 aguentam.  Tal diferen?a na bitola do fio vem causando grande prejuijo ao longo de mais de sculo no bolso dos brasileiros (custo da fia??o, dos eletrodutos e m?o de obra) e no consumo de cobre.    Outros exemplos de op??es que ainda n?o convenceram foram a escolha do padr?o da TV colorida e mais recentemente da Tv digital|`|374d172f6c85b184189e5c3439126b17aa	Porque tem certos aparelhos que n?o necessitam de tanto "impulso eltrico" para funcionar,  o caso dos aparelhos ligados no 110. Tem outros que precisam, os de 220.|`|6db77bddff613b3e252e42e84941ec3daa	Segundo a equa??o r=I/U (resistncia  igual a corrente dividida pela voltagem) uma voltagem de 220 sofre menos resistncia, a corrente constante, do que a 110. Resistncia nada mais  do que a perda de energia enquanto os eltrons trafegam pelo fio. Quanto maior a voltagem, menor a resitncia. Por isso que a energia eltrica  conduzida a longas distancia por fios de alta tens?o (6000 volts usualmente).  Quando chega na nossa rua naqueles trs fios mais altos dos postes, a energia est em 6000 ou 3000 volts e precisa passar por um transformador para ser convertido a 110 ou 220. Repare que os fios mais altos entram nos transformadores e saem para a fia??o mais baixa do poste.  Eles vm em alta tens?o para diminuir a resistncia e s?o convertidos para baixa tens?o perto de nossa casa. Pois , a vem a resposta para sua pergunta: em alguns locais, onde inicialmente a densidade habitacional  menor, como cidades do interior e zonas rurais, as distancias entre o transformador e as casas podem ser muito grandes. Desta forma, a eletricidade tem que viajar um longo trajeto em baixa voltagem. Se este trajeto for percorrido a 220v, a resistncia ser menor, logo tambm a perda de energia, do que se ele trafegar a 110v. Usualmente, cidades do interior possuem corrente em 220v pois a densidade habitacional  mais baixa e um mesmo transformador precisa servir casas muito distantes umas das outras.|`|28a2c62a26919369a45119ccb3e34c82aa	Quando a distancia do gerador e do receptor for grande eh usado 220 ou ate 770000 que eh o caso de Itaipu, para chegar ate nos, e e rebaixada nos transformadores para a voltagem cmoercial. O fundamento eh  para se evitar perdas no fio de cobre. Caso contrario eh usado 110. Para uma resp mais detalhada vc tem que estudar eletrotecnica. suponho que seja "voltagem" comercial que vc se refere.

In the first step, sulfur is burned to produce sulfur dioxide.    (1) S(s) + O2(g)  SO2(g)   This is then oxidised to sulfur trioxide using oxygen in the presence of a vanadium(V) oxide catalyst.    (2) 2 SO2 + O2(g)  2 SO3(g)     (in presence of V2O5)   Finally the sulfur trioxide is treated with water (usually as 97-98% H2SO4 containing 2-3% water) to produce 98-99% sulfuric acid.    (3) SO3(g) + H2O(l)  H2SO4(l)   Note that directly dissolving SO3 in water is impractical due to the highly exothermic nature of the reaction. Mists are formed instead of a liquid. Alternatively, the SO3 is absorbed into H2SO4 to produce oleum (H2S2O7), which is then diluted to form sulfuric acid.    (3) H2SO4(l) + SO3  H2S2O7(l)   Oleum is reacted with water to form concentrated H2SO4.    (4) H2S2O7(l) + H2O(l)  2 H2SO4(l)    Hope this is helpful

The Y chromosome contains a region called SRY (Sex determining Region - Y chromosome), which is actually responsible for development of male characteristics.  If a translocation occurs between the Y chromosome SRY region and another chromosome (the X for example), then it is possible to have an individual with two X chromosomes (which would be female), but because one of those chromosomes now contain the SRY genes, the individual will develop as a male.  Conversly, in a translocation event, if the SRY genes are removed from the Y chromosome, an individual could be XY, and develop as a female (because there are no SRY genes).      So, yes, it is the Y chromosome that determines if a person is male or female, but it in part due to the SRY region ON the Y chromosome that is really responsible.|`|AA11789073	I'm pretty sure that that a transgender person has the expected chromsome structure given the sex they were born with.    Being transgender probably has more to do with development than genetics.    But you can get XY females, and XX males, if the Sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (or SRY) is either deleted, or get transplanted onto the X chromosome.  There are some individuals who have been seen with these chromsomal relocations.|`|AA11647826	In a genetic paradigm the Y in any chromosome combination  indicates male.  XXYs are considered to be male because of the Y chromosome, yet this is purely a genetic view.   For example, some XXYs may never virilize (produce secondary sexual characteristics such as a deeper voice, male pattern hair distribution, and enlarged penis) without testosterone being administered.  Again, some XXYs identify as female, or something in between the typical dichotomy of culturally constructed genders.|`|a0a24faf6f42d94a5868e04b223d2c1faa	No a female cannot be XY.   In fact having the Y is what makes you male.   The default setting in life is XX, but comparatively the X chromosome is much longer than the Y chromosome, meaning women have more genes than men. So to avoid this problem one of the X chromosome's actually kind of 'shuts down' in a female, effectively only one X chromosome is operating.    Transgender occurs when there is a mistake in the switching on and off of genes. For example  you get a man with a woman's thinking patterns because those genes were not switched off and vice versa. That is in the mental state.   If you are referring to the physical state it is still a mistake in the genes, maybe they got spliced, inserted in the wrong area of the chromosome or simply did not get switched on or off properly.

52414242fe3ad4a32e2f2dfe56e02f62aa	If its a heading, they are opposite by 180 degrees. If its a strike (eg, a geometric plane), then they are the same.    The modern and clear way to say these things are:    N5E = 005 degrees (005)  S5W = 185 degrees (185)    Edit - the way to get the degree symbol   is Alt 248.    The quadrant method to obtain a bearing is used only in the US, and then not even consistently; the international and SI standard for a bearing is 000 to 359 (as 360 = 000).    Some examples:    North (N) = N0E  = 000  Northeast (NE) = N45E = 045  East (E) =  N90E = 090  South (S) = S0W  = 180  Southwest (SW) = S45W = 225  West (W)  = S90W = 270    To add to the confusion with the quadrant system, west (270) could be called N90W or S90W. But by convention, the first direction (N or S) should be followed by the number of degrees in a clockwise direction, and then the direction of the "correction."    In mathematics, surveying, aviation, nautical navigation, and engineering the compass direction (or bearing) is always given as a three digit number (except for runways which omit the last digit) between 000 and 360. The only use of the quadrant system seems to be some geologists in the US, and that is gradually disappearing because it is difficult to use quadrants with GIS.    Hope that helps!|`|AA11194456	What happened did you sleep thru class or are you afraid to open your textbook? Draw the graph like your teacher told you to. There are 90 degrees in each quadrant. North is up, South is down, East is to the right, and West is to the left. Now if You start at North and go to the angle which is 5 degrees toward East or right and call that your starting point all you have to do is count the number of degrees it takes to get to the end point. So it's 85 degrees to the line pointing East plus 90 degrees to the line pointing South then another 5 degrees to the line S5W. You add the three numbers together. 85 + 90 + 5 = 180 degrees. You need to do your own homework if you want to learn. You need to learn, it's very important for your future.    Georock1959 is talking about something called azimuth bearing and it's always counted in degrees starting from the north. So West would actually be N275 degrees.

One atom of iron has the same character is one pound.  Molecules are combinations of atoms, like water H2O, and methane CH4.  Sub atomic particles make up atoms.  An atom is a nucleus of protons, neutrons, and other particles, held together by the Strong Force, the most powerful of the four basic forces (Strong,Weak, ElectroMagnetic, and Gravity).  Electrons orbit the atom in shells and orbitals, not in neat spheres, but more complicated shapes of probability graphs.  These are all approximations of quantum equations, such as the Schroedinger Equation, which are very difficult but the only accurate model of these things.  See: atomic chart (the elements).|`|35fdfcc942da772e22a482dd20b5e9b9aa	Elements:  substances which are made of atoms, all of which have the same atomic number.  Examples of elements include oxygen, silicon, sodium, gold, argon, gadolinium and uranium.    Atoms:  Smallest particle of an element that still retains the chemical properties of the element.  1 gram of the element hydrogen contains 602,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms of hydrogen.  That number is called Avogadro's Number, and represents the number of things in a MOLE.    Subatomic Particles:  The first subatomic particle discovered was the electron, easiest to find because it is on the outside part of the atom.  Through a hundred years of refining experimentation, it has been shown that the electrons orbit the nucleus in wave-like patterns whose individual paths are impossible to calculate.  The region of an atom where the electron is most likely to be found at any given time is called an "orbital".  Orbitals are clustered into "sublevels", which are clustered to form "Principal energy levels" (which used to be called "shells".  The electrons zip around the nucleus, which has virtually all of the mass of the atom, but makes up only a tiny portion of the volume of the atom.  The nucleus is made of positively charged protons and neutrally charged neutrons.  The number of protons in an atom is called the "atomic number", and every element has a unique number of protons in its atoms' nuclei.  Oxygen atoms have eight protons in their nuclei, carbon atoms all have six.  The number of neutrons may vary from atom to atom, giving us what are known as isotopes.  Carbon atoms (which all have six protons) with six neutrons gives us the isomer C-12, carbon atoms with eight neutrons give us C-14.  When you add the protons and neutrons in the nucleus together, you get the "mass number".  Most smaller atoms are happy (stable) with roughly the same number of protons and neutrons.  Larger atoms seem to need more neutrons than protons to keep the nucleus stable.  Nuclei with too many or too few neutrons are "radioactive", which means they spit out pieces of themselves in an effort to get to a more stable proportion of protons to neutrons.    Protons and neutrons are themselves made up of quarks, but most folks stop at protons, neutrons and electrons.    Compounds are made of atoms of elements chemically bonded together.  These chemical bonds can occur when atoms of two elements transfer electrons between them (forming charged atoms, called "ions"), forming an ionic bond.  Salt (sodium chloride) is formed when sodium atoms give an electron to chlorine atoms.  The sodium atoms become positively charged, the chlorine atoms become negatively charged, and the two oppositely charged ions attract to form an ionic bond.    Atoms of two elements can also share electrons.  This forms a "covalent" bond, and creates new particles called "molecules".  Water is a molecule formed from two hydrogen atoms sharing electrons with one oxygen atom.  Molecules are very tough...it's very hard to break a covalent bond, not so difficult to break an ionic bond.    There you have a basic introduction to chemistry!|`|76a403a6859368d4282c335fc435b05caa	sub atomic particles are charged and non charged particles that create atoms.  the nucleus of an atom is created by the positively and nutraly charged particles called Protons and Neutrons.  and the negatively charged particles that surround the nucleus are called electrons.  with different numbers of protons you can have different elements.  and addint elements togeather can make compound substances.  basicly elements are objects that only use one kind of atom to make.  for example.  in gold there is only one kind of atom.  and those atoms are called gold because of their atomic number being the same as gold which makes them gold.  but something else like bronze takes multiple elements combined to create its structure.

Si ha che lo spostamento di una riga spettrale di 1 micron (milionesimo di metro) corrisponde ad una velocit di allontanamento di 500 km/sec.  Non bisogna pensare che sono le galassie che si allontanano fra di loro in uno spazio vuoto, ma  lo spazio che dilatandosi trascina le galassie nel suo moto.  Pensa cio di dipingere dei puntini sulla superficie di un palloncino, ora, gonfiandolo vedrai i vari puntini allontanarsi fra di loro.|`|65c7e8cd373e5d15008026758db98355aa	Dicono che sia cos|`|17a1875ef539d85c8cecb3c294e1d168aa	s e stanno cercando di capire se l'espansione continuer, se s fermer, o se si invertir(contrazione).    per sono cose decisamente difficili....la pi gettonata pare essere quella dell'espansione illimitata...    ma chiss|`|AA10215666	Si, e dagli ultimi studi risulta anche perfettamente piatto, e dunque si espander all'infinito.|`|a0534634b9a4e387e6c28a7b102e37d2aa	probabilmente si...sai com'...nulla si crea, nulla si distrugge, tutto si trasforma|`|01f4ce63e9cdd0f85db4ffff1823a7f0aa	Non lo so.  io sto con i piedi per terra e con la testa nella fantasia... ma non sono mai arrivato ai confini dell'universo per poterti rispondere in modo soddisfacente|`|cb2358322bffb3dd712114e677d67425aa	l'universo magari no ma la mia pancia e in espansione continua....|`|9eac352be40f5fd949e69d682416e84caa	il ciclo eterno della natura e il ritorno al big bang!|`|1a182d8246afdaf583dba4439b003c61aa	l' universo  finito ma in espansione

Thus, a line perpendicular to this line will be perpendicular to the x-axis.    The line perpendicular to the x-axis containing the point (2,8) is x=2.    From your choices,   (a)  the line x=8 is perpendicular, but it does not contain the point (2,8), but rather the point (8,y) for all values of y  (c) and (d) both of these lines are parallel to the x-axis and so parallel to the line with equation y=10/9.

O grau de importancia que se d a determinado fato  que nos leva a acreditar que passamos por boas ou ms situa??es.  Com as pessoas acontece o mesmo. Depende do momento e do enfoque que cada um d em sua vida.  Um pessoa pode passar a vida toda praticando boas a??es e num nico deslize cometer um erro e ser taxada de ruim.

Sua autonomia foi reconhecida em 1929. A cidade est encravada em Roma, capital da Itlia. Governado pelo papa, o Vaticano  a sede da Igreja Catlica Apostlica Romana.     O complexo de edifcios conhecido como Palcio do Vaticano contm mais de mil quartos, incluindo a residncia do papa, a sede de governo da Igreja Catlica, inmeras capelas, museus, bibliotecas e a Capela Sistina.     A seguran?a do papa  feita pelos soldados da Guarda Su?a, criada no sculo 15.     O pequeno Estado tem 20 ptios, 1.400 moradias e menos de mil habitantes de diferentes nacionalidades --ningum nasceu no Vaticano, apenas moram no local-- entre membros da Igreja e da Guarda Su?a.     O pas tem seu prprio jornal, banco, moeda, selos, ferrovia, esta??o de rdio e televis?o.  o que restou dos Estados Pontifcios, suprimidos com a unifica??o italiana no sculo 19.     Na diplomacia internacional, o Vaticano tambm  conhecido como a Santa S. Tornou-se um Estado soberano em fevereiro de 1929.     A lngua oficial do Vaticano  o latim, mas l tambm se fala muito o italiano.     Arquitetura     A cidade  cercada pelos muros de Le?o 4o e por uma srie de edifcios. A entrada principal conduz  pra?a de S?o Pedro, rodeada por uma colunata elptica, em frente  Baslica de S?o Pedro, o maior templo crist?o do mundo.     A baslica foi construda entre os sculos 15 e 17 por vrios arquitetos, como Donato Bramante, Michelangelo e Gian Lorenzo Bernini. No seu interior est?o sepultados todos os papas.     Na baslica pode-se encontrar, entre outros verdadeiros tesouros da humanidade, a Piet de Michelangelo, uma das esttuas mais famosas do mundo.     A Capela Sistina, iniciada em 1473, tem um teto abobadado com 20 metros de altura. As paredes laterais est?o decoradas com obras de Perugino e Botticelli. Na abbada os afrescos de Michelangelo, criados entre 1508 e 1512, representam mais de 300 figuras humanas, numa narra??o pica da cria??o do mundo, a expuls?o de Ad?o e Eva do Paraso e a histria de No.     Por cima do altar encontra-se o Julgamento Final, tambm criado por Michelangelo, em 1544.     O Palcio do Vaticano  a tradicional residncia papal desde 1377. De l pode-se contemplar a Capela Sistina. Seu teto  todo pintado com afrescos de Michelangelo.     O Museu do Vaticano, formado por vrios museus, teve seu incio com Clemente 14 e Pio 4. Formado por vrias galerias e museus pontifcios, o Museu do Vaticano  um dos primeiros museus europeus. Em seu riqussimo acervo encontram-se pe?as arqueolgicas, esttuas, mosaicos, esculturas, sarcfagos, inscri??es crist?s antigas, tape?arias, pinturas, entre outros objetos histricos.     Economia     A economia do Vaticano  baseada na capta??o de donativos das igrejas localizadas nos demais cantos do mundo. O Vaticano alega que essa arrecada??o serve para arcar com os custos de evangeliza??o e de programas sociais desenvolvidos.     Outra forma de capta??o de recursos  o turismo dentro do complexo de museus e patrim?nios da humanidade.     Histria     As terras ocupadas hoje pelo Vaticano foram doadas para a Igreja Catlica em 756, por Pepino, o Breve, rei dos francos.     A independncia do Vaticano s foi reconhecida em fevereiro de 1929, por meio do Tratado de Latr?o, assinado pelo ditador fascista Benito Mussolini e o papa Pio 11.      Nesse tratado, a Itlia reconheceu a soberania da Santa S sobre o Vaticano, declarado Estado soberano, neutro e inviolvel. Por outro lado, a Igreja Catlica renunciava aos territrios que havia possudo na Idade Mdia e reconhecia Roma como capital da Itlia.     O acordo tambm garantiu ao Vaticano o recebimento de uma indeniza??o financeira pelas perdas territoriais da unifica??o. Na poca, a Itlia considerou o catolicismo como religi?o oficial do pas.     O tratado foi incorporado  Constitui??o italiana em 1947 com a condi??o de que o papa deveria jurar neutralidade eterna em termos polticos. O papa poderia atuar como mediador em assuntos internacionais, mas s quando fosse solicitado.     Em 1978, os termos desse acordo concordatrio foram reformulados e o catolicismo deixou de ser religi?o oficial da Itlia. Nesse no mesmo ano, as rela??es do Vaticano com a Itlia se deterioram com a aprova??o do divrcio naquele pas.     Esse tratado foi necessrio, pois durante o processo de unifica??o da pennsula, a Itlia gradativamente absorveu os chamados Estados Pontifcios.     Em 1870, por exemplo, as tropas do rei Vittorio Emmanuel entraram em Roma e incorporaram o Vaticano ao novo Estado. Na poca, o papado se recusou a reconhecer a nova situa??o e considerou-se "prisioneiro" do poder laico --n?o-religioso.|`|7c53796b3bb0c1121c8c0bfbbd878dc3aa	 o Vaticano e ponto final!

As ondas de guas abertas ou ondas de superfcie s?o for?as cclicas de energia na superfcie da gua.     Quando em alto mar, estas ondas de energia simplesmente fazem com que a superfcie da gua se mova para cima e para baixo, no plano vertical, sendo muito difcil que se mova para a frente, exceto em condi??es muito tempestuosas.     Com poucas exce??es, tais como atividade ssmica e for?a da mar, as ondas s?o formadas pelas for?as do vento contra a gua. Mesmo observadores casuais podem perceber ondula??es se formarem em guas calmas quando sopra uma brisa.  medida que aumenta a intensidade dos ventos, aumenta o distrbio causado na superfcie das guas, formando-se ent?o as ondas. Ondas maiores podem ser criadas por ventos fortes locais, prximo  praia, mas ondas ainda maiores s?o formadas por tempestades em alto-mar. Estas ondas formadas pela a??o do vento frequentemente viajam por milhares de milhas em mar aberto, antes de a energia do vento ser dissipada com a quebra das ondas na praia.     Trs valores principais contribuem para o tamanho e for?a das ondas geradas pelo vento:     intensidade do vento   distancia viajada por sobre a superfcie da gua   dura??o do vento   As ondas podem ser medidas de diversas maneiras, tais como:     PERODO DE UMA ONDA: o tempo que leva para duas cristas de ondas consecutivas passarem em um dado ponto   COMPRIMENTO DE UMA ONDA: a distancia horizontal entre duas cristas (ou cavados)   ALTURA DA ONDA: a distancia vertical entre a crista e o cavado de uma onda   VELOCIDADE DA ONDA: a velocidade pela qual uma srie de ondas avan?a   Podemos distinguir nas ondas seus trs componentes:     CRISTA: a parte superior da onda, que se projeta alm da linha da gua do mar   VENTRE: a parte inferior da onda que permanece dentro da massa d'gua   BASE:  a parte da onda que se liga com a linha d'gua   Devemos ainda observar:     Se todas as ondas que chegam  praia vm de uma nica fonte, as ondas tenderiam a ser regulares na aparncia e, portanto, com razoavelmente consistentes perodo, comprimento, altura e velocidade.     Isto  raro, pois muitas tempestades podem contribuir para a energia formadora da onda at que ela finalmente chegue  praia. Quando dois ou mais trens de ondas colidem e se misturam, a aparncia da superfcie da gua tambm muda.     Quando ondas de dois ou mais trens encontram crista e cavado elas tendem a se cancelar mutuamente e dispersar a energia que carregavam, reduzindo a altura da onda. Ao contrrio, quando duas ondas de diferentes trens se encontram crista com crista ou cavado com cavado, a altura resultante da combina??o pode ser altamente aumentada em rela??o s alturas individuais. Dentro desses trens de ondas ou atravs da sua intera??o, podem surgir as chamadas ondas rebeldes, que diferem totalmente das outras ondas do trem ou da srie, sendo muito maior que as demais.     Visualmente, a mistura de trens de ondas que chegam  praia resulta em srie de ondas. Estas s?o grupos ocasionais de ondas maiores entremeados de um grande nmero de ondas menores. Quando os trens de ondas entram em fase, combinando seus padr?es, as ondas aumentam em tamanho. Em outras vezes, quando elas est?o fora de fase, as ondas s?o menores e irregulares. Surfistas s vezes ter?o que esperar bastante, bem longe da arrebenta??o, aguardando a forma??o de sries maiores     As sries de ondas podem ser perigosas. Nadadores inexperintes podem entrar no mar durante o remanso e depois serem surpreendidos por ondas superiores s suas capacidades. Pessoas a p, mais perigosamente ainda nas costeiras e pedras, s?o s vezes feridas ou at mortas quando sries de ondas inesperadamente altas os atingem.     Um fen?meno curiosamente importante associado com as sries de ondas que ocorre  que as correntes tipicamente puxam mais fortemente durante o remanso, logo em seguida  entrada de uma srie.     As vagas, em quase todas as praias, vm de uma dire??o previsvel, a menos que seja alterada por tempestades, e mudam de acordo com a esta??o do ano. A dire??o das vagas  tamabm conhecida como dire??o das guas.  medida que muda a dire??o das guas h o favorecimento para a forma??o de correntes de retorno, em raz?o da movimenta??o dos sedimentos arenosos no fundo das praias.     Quando as ondas se aproximam das praias, elas se refratam, isto , elas dobram para se amoldarem  linha costeira. Mesmo as ondas que se originam num angulo agudo  praia tendem a enrolar-se sobre s mesmas prximo e paralelamente  praia, antes de quebrar.     A refra??o  um importante conceito para surfistas, porque geralmente quanto mais diagonal  praia for a aproxima??o, melhor. Quando as ondas quebram na praia inteiramente refratadas, em angulo perpendicular, elas s?o difceis de surfar e produzem corridas curtas. Por outro lado, quando as ondas atingem a praia em angulo, a quebra??o se move lateralmente  linha da praia, permitindo longas corridas.     As vagas s?o chamadas ondas de superfcie se estiverem se movendo em guas mais profundas que 1/2 de seu comprimento.     A velocidade das ondas diminui  medida em que se aproximam de guas mais rasas. Quando isto ocorre, a onda de superfcie se chama onda de gua rasa. O comprimento diminui, a altura aumenta e a velocidade  reduzida, mas o perodo permanece inalterado. Se a profundidade continua a diminuir, a onda torna-se ngreme, ficando maior e maior. Finalmente quando atinge 1,3 vezes sua altura, ela n?o pode suportar-se mais e a crista se precipita para a frente, caindo e formando a quebra??o.

A morte significa apenas mudan?a de plano de vida. Monteiro Lobato dizia: quando morremos passamos do estado slido para o gasoso, mas continuamos a ser os mesmos.  A nossa essncia  espiritual. Com a morte, abandonamos o corpo fsico, mas o esprito continua sua jornada evolutiva em outra dimens?o.  Morrer  fatalidade que nos aguarda e devemos esperar a morte com serenidade e confian?a, pois ela  degrau para a ascens?o espiritual de todos ns.  Depois da morte, continuaremos a ser o que j somos. A morte n?o nos far nem melhores, nem piores do que realmente somos.  Portanto, procure ser agora antes da morte, aquilo que deseja continuar sendo depois dela.

d6f18e0e18e21cc8928be77ae00bff43aa	Sim, para ser mais preciso qualquer experimento em Mecanica Quantica (MQ) tem este carter. Pois antes da experincia, o estado do sistema se encontra numa superposi??o dos possveis estados de medi??o. S quando se faz a medi??o que o sistema colapsa para uma dada medida. Ou seja, antes de abrir a caixa o gato estava no estado=C(1)vivo+C(2)morto (onde       C(1) e C(2) s?o constantes), e ent?o na medi??o o sistema decide em qual estado vai estar. Na experincia de medi??o do spin do eltron o sistema se encontra antes da medi??o no estado=C(1)spin para cima+C(2)spin para baixo, e tambm da mesma forma o sistema decide em qual estado vai estar na medi??o. O carter probabilstico da MQ n?o  um erro, ele ocorre por que, por uma quest?o de princpio, n?o nos  permitido conhecer o presente em sua plenitude (incerteza de Heisenberg). Logo, nossas previs?es futuras ser?o probabilsticas.  A realidade na MQ  aquilo que podemos medir, e como as medi??es que fazemos usando a MQ n?o encontramos medidas do tipo "gato vivo-morto", n?o temos nenhum problema. O fato de se considerar a MQ incompleta n?o est ligada a este fato, e sim a causalidade (relatividade restrita).|`|374d172f6c85b184189e5c3439126b17aa	Nossa...n?o entendi nada!|`|e49d6e3eec1fd8ec1dba0e3f1ec0e4a8aa	O gato  colocado numa caixa selada. No interior da caixa existe um dispositivo que contm um ncleo radioativo e um frasco de gs venenoso. Quando o ncleo decai, emite uma partcula que acciona o dispositivo, que parte o frasco e mata o gato. De acordo com a mecanica quantica, o ncleo  descrito como uma mistura de "ncleo decado" e de "ncleo n?o decado". No entanto, quando a caixa  aberta o experimentador v s um "gato morto/ncleo decado" ou um "ncleo n?o decado/gato vivo." A quest?o  a de saber quando  que o sistema deixa de ser uma mistura de estados e se torna num ou noutro? O objetivo da experincia  ilustrar que a mecanica quantica  incompleta se n?o existirem regras que descrevam quando  que a fun??o de onda colapsa e o gato se torna morto ou vivo em vez de uma mistura de ambos.    Ao contrrio da convic??o popular, Schr?dinger n?o pretendia mostrar que existem gatos mortos/vivos; o que ele queria mostrar  que a mecanica quantica  uma teoria incompleta.    Por isso mesmo  que se chama "TEORIA" e n?o "LEI"

It is important to note that the Kelvin scale is based on 2 reference points:  1.  The kelvin scale relies on the Absolute Zero, which is the temperature at which ALL kinetic motion of matter particles stops.    2.  And its second point of reference is the triple point of pure water (prepared as per the VSMOW* standard).  The triple point of pure water is defined as the point of temperature and atmospheric pressure at which the three phases of the substance (gas, liquid & solid) can coexist.      *: VSMOW - Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water|`|6a48621693ddb95b8d80086a7af66a5caa	Kevin or K, in science stands for that stupidest KID in science class.|`|f9e0440f68f76a5bd4f5092af0531680aa	It's a measure of temperature, like Celsius (centigrades) and Fahrenheit.

Absolute zero, or 0K, is the temperature at which molecular energy is a minimum, and it corresponds to a temperature of -273.15 on the Celsius temperature scale. The Kelvin degree is the same size as the Celsius degree; hence the two reference temperatures for Celsius, the freezing point of water (0C), and the boiling point of water (100C), correspond to 273.15K and 373.15K, respectively. When writing temperatures in the Kelvin scale, it is the convention to omit the degree symbol and merely use the letter K. The temperature scale is named after the British mathematician and physicist William Thomson Kelvin, who proposed it in 1848. Another absolute temperature scale, the Rankine temperature scale, is used by some engineers. You'll find more good science information at http://www.mysciencebuzz.com
