3ac064b8503fcb4abcff6f6401a4aae1aa	Uma crian?a de 9 anos tem boa capacidade de entendimento das coisas ... n?o precisa de uma explica??o muito simples n?o !!! Mas vamos lá.<br>  Gera??o é criar uma coisa, geralmente a partir de outra. Por exemplo, para gerar energia elétrica é necessária a transforma??o de energia mecanica (água em movimento na hidroelétrica, por exemplo) em energia elétrica. Para gerar um bebê, é necessária a transforma??o dos gametas (espermatozóide e óvulo) em um embri?o.<br>  O conceito de gera??o esta um pouco deturpado mas acho que para uma crian?a de 9 anos é suficiente.<br>  Abra?os|`|3de2e41885c163e69aa337c67f64734daa	dê exemplos de épocas... por exemplo, "a gera??o dos seus pais gostava de tais grupos musicais, q faziam sucesso na época", etc.... explique que é um determinado período, geralmente definido em 10 anos.|`|qi7mfUYTaa	Vou pelo caminho do prático e do objetivo. Convide-o pra gerar um bolo com você e, etapa a etapa, vá mostrando para que serve fermento, farinha, ovos, leite, chocolate. De um monte de coisas isoladas e desconexas, quando misturadas com critério e método, se gera alguma coisa, no caso um bom bolo de chocolate. Assim se gera um filho e, de tantas gera??es, se faz uma Gera??o de pessoas. N?o acho complicado. A analogia é o mais eficiente caminho de aprendizagem que já conheci. Quando se compara se entende.|`|GpspJGULaa	Olá<br>  <br>  Ficou subentendido que trata-se de criar algo...dê exemplos com animais, por exemplo, que é mais sutil.|`|Cb2vtXXlaa	N?o sei.rs<br>  é difícil explicar de uma forma simples.<br>  Explique usando a família como exemplo.<br>  <br>  Diz assim: Na família você tem, seus avós, seus pais e você.

Na menarca é normal a menstrua??o ser bem desregulada: ficar um mês sem vir, vir duas vezes no mesmo mês, demorar um pouco mais ou um pouco menos para terminar... mas sangrar por mais de uma semana, mesmo na menarca, n?o é muito comum, e nem muito saudável. Te aconselho a procurar uma ginecologista: ela vai te orientar melhor e resolver seu problema. Um abra?o e boa sorte.

Ser homosexual n?o é normal para a maioria. Mas se um filho seu chegar em casa dizendo: Sou homossexual!<br>   O choque vai ser inorme. Normal. O que vc tem que enterder é que n?o podemos escolher o destino dos nossos filhos, pois n?o sabemos nem o nosso. Deixe que ele fa?a as suas escolhas. Ele é amparado por lei. Apartir do momento que vc n?o aceita, vc está discriminando. E n?o adianta insistir, porque se esta foi a decis?o dele, por mais que seja reprimido, no dia em que acan?ar sua maioridade, voltará a ser homoxessual.

Your children are 2 different people, why would you want to give them one of the same names? Out of ALL the names out there you can't find another one you would even consider? Maybe after a relative?|`|J2gr1ogHaa	not so much weird but, unfair, thoughtless, uncreative, and boring. I know a girl that named her five daughters:<br>  Sara Marie<br>  Anna Marie<br>  Sarah-Ann Marie<br>  Leah Marie<br>  Ann Marie<br>  <br>  3 of them changed their names. They argued and fought and did not get along.|`|oDgnXJB8aa	No not weird but totally unfair. Give the baby middle name Neveah that spells heaveN backwards. Hope you like it............|`|VZ0xI1Jjaa	I wouldn't give them the same middle name. Mia Sophie Jaide would sound like sound good with Zoey Emma Paige.|`|K3ViTpbcaa	no. my nephews both have the same middle name. i think those names are very cute!|`|YvRkuPzOaa	I think it depends on why you like the name Paige. If it's a family name or the name of someone you look up to I think it's fine to name them all the same, otherwise you just look lazy. <br>  <br>  I worked with a set of twins named Kelly Anne and Kathryn Anne. Anne was their mothers name so it worked out well for both of them. Good luck!<br>  How about trying:<br>  <br>  Zoey Emma Brinsley<br>  Mia Sophie Caroline|`|BBXF5bXDaa	well actually i think that sharing the same middle name would not be the very best idea because most sisters long for uniqueness so sticking them with the same middle name from birth would not be the greatest idea. <br>   <br>  thank you for letting me share my opinion with u|`|DcE0FK7gaa	Yes, it's about being unique and keeping it original for your child. She will have to live with this name for ever and I don't think she will feel too special about sharing her middle name with her sister. That's my opinion.|`|AA10795096	No, make it a new tradition.  My bff's entire family's middle name is the same, cousins and everything.  Its a unisex name, so it works for boys and girls.|`|fYt20J1Uaa	No its not weird to have the same middle names. Infact if you don't like having the same middle names you could swap them all around. For example:<br>  Jennifer Pearl Read<br>  Pearl Jennifer Read<br>  Eddie Charles Read<br>  Charles Eddie Read|`|WaduRYIyaa	NO. In fact me, my sister and my brother have the same middle names.<br>  <br>  Mine - Chloe Sydney<br>  Brother - Ryan Sydney<br>  Sister - Lauryn Sydney|`|SQtvlyazaa	i used different middle names...but with nice first name  yes you can have the same middle name..use urs..or ur mothers....make it a family thing.|`|Nkp54KTyaa	Nope...I think it's cute to have the same middle name. It's a cute way to show that they're sisters|`|XSsJ7yi2aa	Not at all, my friends entire family has the middle name Page. You could make it a family tradition? nothing wrong it
9b6WmrdPaa	One way or the other your dad is goin to find out, so tell him NOW - if n e thing he could help you make a decision.<br>  What you should do is:<br>  1) Approach him; let him be empathetic (put himslef in your 'shoes') about your situation. Like say "dad i really need your support right now- and this will mean alot to me to have your support in a big decision in my life.- im pregnant." and you can probably go on to say that "i know how you feel right now but that is what you are here for dad. <br>  Listen i was 14 weeks pregnant when i was 15 years old. I was of course terrified when found out- and as well had mixed feelings like " hey its my baby i want to keep this" but now i have no regret that i did what i have to do becuase i really asked myself "do i really want to have a baby for this guy" what about my future. etc. <br>  Its hard to say, but the best thing i would tell you is to do what makes you happy- think about your future as well. So think about the repercussions and consequences such as dropping out of high school, humiliation, baby food, bills, what if your bf leaves you,etc. you also said that hardly can take care of your self- honey, honestly i know you are not ready. <br>   So tell your dad, and make the best decisions of your life. I had no regret and i am happy now. you will be too. <br>  Good luck and you can email me- i would love to be there to support you.|`|vrVfLfYBaa	i was in this situation a few years ago, and i freaked out too. my parents are strict catholics and i actually had a place lined up to go stay at in case they kicked me out when i told them i was three months pregnant. i learned that actually, just because they say that they will do something like that, doesn't mean they will. my parents turned out to be completely cool and helped me with everything. my daughter just turned two this year and is the light of my parents life. <br>  <br>  just tell your dad that you're pregnant and that more than anything right now, you need his help and support in your decision because it's definetly one that affects the rest of your life. let him know that you are scared and that coming to him took a lot of guts... i know that that was a major point i had to make with my parents when i told them. they said that they really respected me for coming to them with it instead of trying to hide it. just give ur dad a chance... he might be mad for a little bit, but i think he'll come arond eventually. good luck!|`|5i1aYgnEaa	just tell him as soon as possible. We cant really tell you how to tell him, there isnt very many ways to do it, just say it. He probably just wanted to threaten you so you would have been more careful but if he loves you he will support you. He might be mad at the beginning but when he gets over it, im sure he will be with you. In case he does kick you out, ask a friend to stay over for a couple of days to give your dad some time to cool off.|`|OC6ffEW3aa	you first need to tell him.. <br>  you have to tell him sometime simply sit him down.. not when he is mad.. and tell him you are pregnant and are fully aware of what you got yourself into.. be very mature about it..  your just freaking yourself out more by thinking about telling him.<br>  i honestly dont think that any parent would kick there child out if they had no where to go...<br>  if you tell him and he still wants to kick you out simply ask if you can stay there until you have the baby and find a place to go. <br>  good luck with everything.|`|lZm5fyCiaa	i think you should be like "dad i have something to tell you" and then you tell him that your pregnant...but just in case he meant what he said about kicking you out you should get a job now if you dont have one...also i hope your baby daddy's around if hes a good father he will help you make it through too|`|ySNOW4qIaa	Just sit him down and tell him that your pregnant.. Talk to him about it and (hopefully) if you plan on keeping it let him know you'll take responsability for it.. If its just you and your dad he shouldn't kick you out! I'm sure he'll be mad at first but  should get over it..|`|2jKOms6Saa	i would just sit him down and tell him. or write him a letter, then things will sound just how you want them to and you wont have to be face to face, it might give him time to cool down and think too.|`|3Ze2m4qoaa	Sorry, but I have no advice besides..... run far far away! Thats what I would do!|`|sWrxyJm0aa	gosh what is up with all these teens getting pregnant......you'll are ruining your lives use protection.....well if you don't want to tell your dad then tell your mom maybe things will workout........it's what you get! 0_0|`|A1bxyVcHaa	Well you made a bad call, but I bet you dad was just talkin out his a** when he said that. And he sounds like a loving parent so I bet he'll understand most likely later than sooner...|`|J3nSfoyPaa	Sit  and pray then..tell him ....leave it to god...<br>  god bless|`|x84UQgadaa	Go 2 another state and call him on tha phone and tell him. That way ur not in reaching distance =] (im serious)|`|b23108a67f933917cc0a1f19873ac817aa	just say hey dad ur going to be a grandfather, jk,good luck though|`|Ujdt4bmFaa	hm I'm not really sure if i should congrat you or not, so i won't. But you need to decide what you're going to do (tell the father of the baby, that you're keeping it giving it up for adoption etc)  and you also need to tell your father, unless you're going to run away or something which i don't suggest =/ just sit him down calmly explain to him that you make a mistake and you know you was wrong he most likely will get mad, thats normal maybe he'll need time alone to think and later you should discuss your plans with him or write a later (instead of talking to him) sometimes it is easier to express your feelings on paper than when you're actually talking to someone<br>  you didnt say if you had a mother or not (hoping you do) you could talk to her (unless you don't talk to her-it happens) and explain to your mother can sometimes be more understanding and maybe she could tell your father?|`|nfJU6jCXaa	Girl, i was 17 and pregnant too, i did NOT tell my dad he found out when i was 6months preggers. And he also told me he would kick me out, thats y i never told him, well the point is that he did kick me out and i had to live wit my boyfriend. I didnt talk to my dad for about 2months and now hes happy he has a grand daughter but seriously he doesnt let me live in peace he reminds me everyday of how i f*cked up my life. This might sound like bad advice but dont tell him, just based on my experience start saving money now asap.|`|9MpoHWsoaa	Well.<br>  He's bound to notice sooner or later, so you need to tell him.<br>  Just sit him down and be very, very mature about it.<br>  It may be a good idea to call a friend and see if it is okay if you stay with them if your dad kicks you out.<br>  I'm not sure what else you can do, good luck sweetie.|`|AA10716847	you need to tell him and deal with what comes next. most parents say things like that to try and keep there kid from have sex. good luck and just own up to your responsibility.

It is where you lose your temper, and you SHAKE your baby in a rage.<br>  <br>  Now, look, I had severe Post-Partum Depression.  It was like living in a nightmare.

Abortions are expensive and sometimes can lead to infections, so you need to be closely monitored afterwards. I would suggest telling your mother and discussing with her what your best option is. I think that you should go with an adoption myself. That baby living inside you already has a beating heart...it is your choice but you should think of all the couples out there that are not able to have children and how much joy you would bring to their lives by giving them a baby and giving the baby growing inside you a chance to live the life you started!|`|pp9RzHvDaa	Adoption isn't an option?  Why not?<br>  Your mom needs to know everything so she can help you.  I don't think you're ready to deal with this alone at 13.

Your mom needs to know your having sex at 13 and now pregnant.<br>  Abortion is murder. Just thought I'd throw that out there.<br>  Find a family that would adopt it straight from you.<br>  Or if you really are bent about an abortion, you have to check the laws in your state. Some states you have to have a parent there. Talk to your mom. She'll be freaked out and mad at first I'm sure, but she will get over it. Nothing she can change now.<br>  Good Luck with that.<br>  p.s. learn to use a condom. =) it prevents these things. and diseases.|`|CNDdRFR2aa	Okay if adoption is not an option, maybe you can pawn it off on a family member.

sgMno1PRaa	I think she is really out of order to say that. She is only 9 years old and comments like that stick in your head - plus she is going through lots of changes so probley doesnt feel that comfortable anyway. If anything at this time in her life she needs reassurance and engouragement that everything is ok and the changes are normal - not someone calling her fat!! <br>  The whole media is pushing this image of what girls should look like and we are all being bought into a world with such pressure to look the right way.<br>  This needs to change so children are bought up feeling secure and happy with the way they look otherwise it can lead to loads of problems in later life.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Sounds like grandma isn't quite ready for your daughter to become a 'female' yet - in her eyes she's still a little girl  YOU need to sit down and have a talk with the grand mother.<br>  Something similar happened to my twin grand daughters and I.  When they were younger I would walk up behind them, wrap my arms around then and hug them.  After they begun puberty, I had to change my behavior because one of the twins took it the wrong way, talkted to a councelor at school, she said something to my daughter-in-law and then she said something to me.  I told her (my daughter-in-law) "I'm not going to jail just because she is developing and she did not say it was bothering her.  She should have said something to me".  <br>  Now, I still hug them but it must be face-to-face.  I, as a grand parent, have the responsibility to notice 'differences' - not the child's.  Besides, young girls go through a lot of changes, they don't understand the changes and are sometimes too embarrased to say anything, therefore, it's not the child's responsibility to say anything.|`|LZ6ZsqM3aa	I would let the grandmother know how hurt your daughter was at these comments.<br>  <br>  It is not excusable to say that it was the heat of the moment. Things are going to get worse before they get better!<br>  <br>  Comments like that can cause serious problems. I ended up being bulimic after Years of being teased about my weight.|`|N89HLv92aa	Your daughter should not have to take that kind of verbal abuse no matter what she did. You should sit down and explain to your mother in law that she really hurt your daughters feelings and that you were teased for being overweight and it hurt you. So explain to her that your daughter takes after you on getting over emotional and that she might want to watch what she says around her. Good Luck and God Bless!|`|PTwgXnauaa	Hey im very very disappointed after reading almost same comments from so many people..whats wrong with everyone? C'mon you should act as grown-ups. Well i admit that what your mother-in-law said was not right but there is also one point that you should consider that she is your MIL's son's daughter too. Just place yourself in her position and think could you say something like this to your daughter's child WITH BAD INTENTION. i dont think so..please dont take it that seriously. I know it must have hurt you but dont show it in front of your daughter. When she told you, you shuld have told her that "No you shouldn't think like that, you know that you are not fat, she is your grandmother and she must have said that just like that..dont feel bad" and things like that. She should grow up to be a positive person..<br>  But as i dont know what kind of person your MIL is so if you are still not satisfied you can have a cool discussion with her that your daughter said so and so and what sort of phase she is going through these days. This way she'll feel she shouldnt have said that even while joking (which again i think she already felt as she apologized) but please keep your daughter away from this discussion and stuff coz if you encourage her, she will always find a way to complain about someone or other to you. You'll spoil her personality like that.<br>  I hope i hav'nt annoyed you saying all this actually this is how i strongly feel about upbringing of children as this is a very important stage for building their personality and respect for elders (no matter even if they are wrong) is a very important lesson to teach them.<br>  Sorry again if i offended you!|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	I would first explain to her that adults aren't perfect either and that sometimes, when we are pushed to the edge we can say or do hurtful things, even to those we love. And then point out that she is lucky though, at least her grandmother was nice and respectful enough to apologize later. She didn't try to act like she didn't do anything wrong, she admitted it and asked forgiveness for it. ALOT of adults aren't able to do even that!<br>  <br>  I think that since you were overweight you are making a bigger deal of it than it really was. Yeah, it wasn't nice, but you took it personal. If she isn't overweight I would have asked her why she is so hurt by it, she's not fat and she knows it.... so she obviously knows grandma said it out of frustration.<br>  <br>  Either way, I wouldn't let it keep going. What's done is done. Grandma said sorry, and now your daughter can learn what it's like to forgive.|`|pp9RzHvDaa	Well, at least she apologized.  But I would expect an explanation from your MIL because it was still extremely inappropriate.  Just explain to your MIL that she shouldn't be so harsh because your daughter is only 9 years old and she is going to act her age.  If she can't put up with it then she should admit it instead of ruining her granddaughter's self esteem.  Being angry does not justify what she said.  I would confront her about it.  She must think she can just apologize to her and she won't have to explain herself to you.  But you are the parent, and she is your daughter.  Your MIL will have to own up to what she said and change her ways.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	Your daughter is 9 years old, your mother in law is an adult. Nothing that your daughter could do or say justifies your mother in law saying what she said and she should be ashamed of herself. I would confront her about this. The last thing a 9 year old needs is to be concerned with is body image issues. As a parent I would make it clear to her that if she can't maintain some self control around your child then she won't be spending time with her unsupervised because you don't want your healthy 9 year old daughter developing a complex that turns into an eating disorder. I would absolutely say something about this and I am one of the least confrontational people on the planet.|`|pB1oXLz5aa	I would just let her know that this kind of language will not be tolerated. if she cannot watch her mouth then she can't watch your kids. plain and simple. I grew up in a chaotic dysfunctional home myself and I take great strides to make sure my sons and daughters don't have to endure the kind of verbal assaults I did. your children are gonna get picked on and knocked down in life but it should never be by family|`|iVmSh1iVaa	Oh God, how awful. I honestly don't know what to tell you to do, but I can say that I totally understand how you feel and I'm sorry you're hurt over it.  It was totally uncalled for. I don't know what it is with people. Adults are the first ones to tell kids, "if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all." And yet this came from the mouth of an adult. For shame.|`|WNn8WDPHaa	call your mother in law and have a long talk with her about what to say to say and what not to say to a none year old girl. obviously she forgot what being in puberty was like and how it feels to be insulted|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	The grandmother is mean to say such thing to a young child.<br>  tell your daughter not to worry, her Grandmother is just Jealous of her beautiful body coz she knows ur daughter is very Pretty and sexy.. <br>  She will feel better trust me :)<br>  Also ask ur Husband to tell his mother not to say such things to your daughter she's a young child this could actually effect her for long time.<br>  ask him to talk to his mother.<br>  But try talking to ur daughter bout it and how she should ignore such dumb comments from people.|`|RSb195a3aa	You should talk to your in-laws. Your daughter is their grandchild, and your mother-in-law shouldn't be acting like that towards her. They should even be thankful that you visit them, and you let their grandchild spend some time with them. Is this attitude of you mother-in-law always like this or just in this situation? Either way, at least she apologized to your daughter. Again, you should talk to them. Tell them how things are different from before (their time), so they should be careful when with your daughter. Remind them that she is starting puberty, and the damages they cause now might scar her for the rest of her life. Also, even if she isn't at the stage of puberty, she is a child only nine years old. Children have rights of their own. As a parent, you are doing a great job in trying to protect her. Does your husband/the father know about this? He would be greater help since your in-laws are his parents, so he can deal with this more. I suggest you try to be a good friend to your daughter as well. I was overweight and chubby during puberty and adolescent years. Yes, it does hurt a lot especially when it is your friends or family doing these things. They may not know or even notice, so they should be informed. In addition, try to encourage your daughter to be herself. It is not a crime, and people will accept her for it. All that physical image-building things are not to be hurried and are not necessary right now. She's only nine, and she has a long journey ahead of her. Maybe it's the only one she'll get, so she should get a worthwhile one. Good luck! :)|`|TK03jZTuaa	OK. I would feel very disappointed in grandma, and even if she said sorry I would still mention to her that I wouldn't want that to happen again. if you do at least that, she knows to be extra careful next time. Tell her that your daughter felt very hurt by this comment so she understands.<br>  <br>  Sometimes grandparents say dumb things but they need to know that it is not OK to repeat the incident.<br>  <br>  The next thing is to deal wtih your own issues. You say you have memories of being teased. I understand that makes it difficult however your daughter is not you. Try to leave your past behind and deal with what you have right now. You simply don't need to think about the past in this situation. It will not help, only hinder.<br>  <br>  But mostly, use this opportunity to explain to your daughter that no-one is perfect and we all make mistakes. Tell her she needs to forgive grandma for that hurtful comment and get on with life, not mentioning it ever again.<br>  <br>  This is a great chance to show her how to be gracious even when people aren't fair to her. There will always be someone in life who doesn't treat you right. Learning the grace to handle these situations will stand her in good stead for later on in life.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter whether your daughter pushed grandma to the limits or not, that is not the issue. What grandma said was very wrong. So don't think for a second that your daughter deserved to be talked to in that manner.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I think the real issue is why you think its all right for daughter to be up to her usual gimmicks. .|`|AA10628838	I would have my husband talk to his mom about how it hurt your daughter.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Sounds to me like they worked it out for themselves. She realized she was wrong and apologized - it's over, let it go.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	WOW,, If my in law said something like that to my daughter i would be pissed.. Even if she apologized,, it still don't mean anything. she shouldn't have said it from the start.. And as far as you daughter pushing your in law is no excuse,, who is the child and who is the adult.. the in law crossed the line big time if you asked me and it should not be ignored ,,  She's nine now what about the next time your in law can't hold her ignorant tongue,, what damage will it do then when she's older and more insecure.. Good luck with this one.. I would just tell the in law straight up how you feel and that if this ever happened again then she wont be seeing much of her again with out supervision so you can watch her tongue for her...|`|CxCigxZIaa	She apologized for pete's sake. <br>  Yes you are hurt and so is your daughter. <br>  Life lesson: perhaps your daughter is tad overweight because what other reason would the grandparent say this horrible thing?<br>  (just saying...)<br>  Note: she did apologize.<br>  We've all done it (as parents) said things when we know as soon as they come out that we shouldn't have. <br>  Let her know though that you appreciate her apologizing to your daughter...just so SHE knows that you know.<br>  :)<br>  Then...<br>  Let it go.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Well what Grandma said was pretty hurtful and thank goodness she apologized for it.  It's probably been a long time since Grandma had a 9 year old in the house, and for an extended visit too, it was probably a bit trying for her.  I think you should explain that to your daughter and tell her that she didn't mean what she said.  In the meantime, if you get a chance, bring it up with Grandma.  Say that you realize she apologized and all that, but you are worried about your daughter's fragile self esteem and see what Grandma says.  Take it from there.
AA12185963	It is ok. Think of how many women over years and years have dyed their hair. My Ob told me that it doesnt stay in the blood stream long enough to get to or harm the baby. <br>  <br>  <br>  Question: Is it safe to color my hair during pregnancy?<br>  <br>  Answer: I'm asked this question regularly in my clinical practice, and I wish I had an easy answer. In general, I suggest that pregnant women consider waiting until after the first trimester, but after that I leave the decision up to each patient. No one has enough information to guarantee that using chemical dyes on your scalp during pregnancy is completely safe. That said, there's no evidence that using these dyes every month or two will cause birth defects, either.  <br>  <br>  Over the years, people have conducted animal studies trying to shed light on this matter. Some, but not all, studies have shown a few of the chemical compounds in hair dyes to be teratogenic (meaning they can cause birth defects). However, in many cases, the animals were exposed to extremely high doses of these chemicals, doses that far exceed the amount a woman would receive from coloring her hair every month or two. Clearly, the chemicals in both permanent and semi-permanent hair dyes are not highly toxic.|`|b22ab6523c610a9bdd933dd0bc2e93d2aa	My doc says it is fine, they dont want you to get a all over color that touches the scalp.  I did it both of mine and no probs.|`|AA10596507	I think the lighter the color, the easier it is on your system.  Also, make sure they don't touch the scalp.
aRJ3ZMkUaa	Well, don't be very rude to the child and hit him. He may control it for the first few times, but once children get angry after being beaten,  it may drive them to do things like suicide. Re-in force desirable behavior with good things (hugs etc) and dissuade undesirable behavior with not so good things (frowns etc). Make sure you show him that you love him and will get him anything he wants and soon he will realize the love you have for him and he will slowly start listening to you. Also please make sure that you don't scream at him when he's happy; he may start crying and it may affect him very badly, causing psychological problems. Children lose their love towards their parents in this way. Try to be as nice as possible as soon you can get you will see some change in attitude in the boy.|`|4SrdYUuSaa	Egad -- I have never heard that generally rude children become decent adults, but that is a debate for another day.<br>  <br>  My son loses privileges if he utters one, rude word -- this is enforced by his parochial school as well.<br>  <br>  What I have found to work best (because they WILL test you) is to look at them like they are from Mars, look at them with disbelief, or simply raise my eyebrows and **** my head to one side.  I say nothing.<br>  <br>  If he didn't get it with the "looks", I say something like, "I'm certain my ears are failing me, Son, because I thought I heard you say something hurtful about (name).  I know you wouldn't do that because you would probably not want to lose television for the night, right?  So, why don't you try to restate what you were trying to say."<br>  <br>  It took some time for him to "get it".  When he was about 7, I had to sit him down and ask him how he would feel if (name) said those things to him.

They just say whatever it is they are thinking.  When your child says something rude, use that as a chance to explain why you don't say whatever it is they said.  You need to explain clearly and not just say "don't say that."  They need to learn what is acceptable and what isn't.  |`|JJ40OcYqaa	Who told you this theory?  Children learn from us or from other grownups (grandmamma, teachers, etc).  If a child is rude now; more than likely they will be just as pretentious when they grow up – maybe even worse.  The thing to do now is to correct the behavior, and tell them that it is not acceptable.  If you encounter a child that acts rude and it’s not yours, you need address it with their parents.  It’s probably overlooked to them and they may take offense; but at least you’re giving them fair warning if you respond back to the child the same way they responded to you.  It’s up to us to shape our young ones into proper, respectable people now so they will be decent individuals in the future.  |`|UGRTKKp2aa	Well, first of all the child needs to be taught that its not acceptable to be rude, they also need to be shown, you know that old saying actions speak louder than words?  If the child is seeing rude behavior from parents, etc. then of course this is what he/she will model by.<br>  <br>  There's a great program called The Total Transformation by James Lehman.

l8Ntr0ERaa	Good Question! I had a C-section and then an accidental VBAC. I was going to have a C-section and then at 35 weeks I was told that I was dilating and I got a shot to help the baby's lungs get ready for life outside the womb. That night I had some really bad cramping and was told it was to be expected with that shot and to drink water, lay down and watch them. An hour later I was sure I was in labor and got ready to go in and when I got there they said I wasn't and wanted to watch me for an hour. I told them I was and they should call the Dr. well 45 min. later I was crowning and they were in a mad dash to get the Dr. and he walked in checked me and I sure was crowning! There was no time to put me in a real L&D room or anything! The baby was born 10 min. later, healthy. I am glad (so was the Dr.) that in the end I didn't have to do another section, it was not good for me the first time! |`|f39e8475c8f65146e9266b38be944586aa	although i have not experienced this before but i checked a few sites and this is what i found. i hope this is helpful and the sources are listed below.<br>  Suggestions for VBAC Delivery<br>  From our experience<br>  Ken and Rita Turkowski<br>  <br>  Neither of us has any formal medical training, yet we feel that we can offer the following suggestions to anyone considering a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery.<br>  <br>  Refrain from using pitocin or oxytocin to induce the labor. When your body is ready to deliver, it will. If you try to encourage a birth before your body is ready, you risk causing trouble. There may be occasions (like macrosomia -- big babies) where it is preferable to induce rather than wait several weeks when the baby's size may increase the probability of rupture, but be aware of the risks in either case, and make an informed decision. <br>  Do not get a cesarean just because you are at 40 weeks. Many healthy babies are delivered past 42 weeks. Only at 42 weeks would you want to start thinking about a cesarean, but a trial of labor is still an option. Due date estimates are just that -- estimates -- and can be off by several weeks. <br>  Do not artificially rupture your membranes ("break your water"). Of course, if they break on their own, that's another story; it starts the clock ticking and you need to get labor well established within 24 hours or so. In this case you may need to resort to pitocin or have a cesarean. <br>  Do not get an epidural before 6 cm whatever you do. You risk increasing the probability of "failing to progress (FTP)". Ideally you can wait until 8 cm or forego an epidural altogether. Epidurals have been shown to cause problems that require a cesarean. <br>  There was a recent paper which describes a technique to predict when you are very unlikely to have a uterine rupture. It uses ultrasound at 37 weeks to measure the thickness of the uterine wall. If it is thick, then you are almost assuredly not going to have a uterine rupture. However, if your uterus is thin, the test is not able to say anything. So if you happen to be in the thick category, you need not worry. If you're in the thin category, you really don't have any more information than before you took the test, so you have nothing to lose. The paper citation is: <br>  Rosenberg, P., Goffinet, F. Philippe, H., Nisand, I., Ultrasonic Measurement of Lower Uterine Segment to Assess Risk of Defects of Scarred Uterus, The Lancet, vol. 347, Feb. 3, 1996, pp. 281-284. <br>  Ask questions about every procedure. Ask whether it is necessary, what the benefits are, and what the risks are. Discuss with your doctor in detail the methods that would be used in your delivery. Write them down on a piece of paper, sign it, and have your doctor sign it. Post it in the delivery room where the staff can see it. <br>  Consider giving your doctor a copy of Catherine Grace's story to read. <br>  Get a certified doula. Interview a few of them, and find one that seems knowledgeable, responsive to your concerns, and willing to help you understand what you're about to go through. She will be your advocate, intermediary and counselor. She can provide individualized instruction about the techniques and risks. She will try to give a "balanced" presentation, but will most likely spend more time describing alternatives to your doctor's preferences. Compare opinions between the doula and your obgyn. If they both agree, you have a good decision. If they don't, you should explore other options, or read up on more medical literature about the technique. <br>  Read. There's a number of suggestions of books to read on www.childbirth.org. <br>  Know what's happening in the delivery room. If one of the staff is concerned about something, ask why. If they say that you needn't be concerned about it, say that you *are*, and want to know everything! <br>  Make sure you can trust your doctor. Change doctors if yours does not want to answer your questions. Make sure s/he understands you and that his/her answers indicates that s/he understood the question. If you feel that the doctor gives you answers to different questions than the ones you asked, change doctors. If the doctor uses terms that you are not familiar with, ask him/her to define them for you. Learn his/her lingo. In the delivery room, things can move real fast, and there is no time to give definitions of terms. If s/he can say a couple of words that communicate exactly to you and s/he what the situation is, you can assist. <br>  Have your doctor read the following: <br>  Weinstein, D., Benshushan, A., Ezra, Y., Rojansky, N., Vaginal Birth after Cesarean Section: Current Opinion, International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics, 53 (1996), pp. 1-10. <br>  Farmer, R., Kirschbaum, T., Potter, D., Strong, T., Medearis, A., Uterine Rupture During Trial Of Labor After Previous Cesarean Section, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, October 1991, pp. 996-1001. <br>  Jones, R., Nagashima, A., Hartnett-Goodman, M., Goodlin, R., Rupture of Low Transverse Cesarean Scars During Tr|`|12d886c6cfc0f6a5f3386695abbbfe6baa	No. But I am pregnant with my 2nd and I am trying for a VBAC this time... if you want to try for a VBAC, you need to find an OB or midwife who supports VBACs. Also getting a doula can REALLY help! Learn all you can and educate yourself... visit the ICAN website and start going to meetings (International Cesarean Awareness Network)- they are pro-VBAC and tell you how to make that happen! Most C-sections should not happen- I mean there ARE cases where they can save lives, but it is way overused esp in this country. And there are many risks with a repeat c-section, no matter what doctors say... it is major surgery! If you had a low horizontal incision, and especially if you were double-stitched, you are an excellent candidate for VBAC! Why did you have a c-section? Mine was b/c I was induced for the convienience of my doctor. Induction leads to many many unnecessary c-section because the body just isn't ready to give birth. I did dilate to 10 but baby got stuck in a posterior position since they manually broke my water too early- ugh! Makes me mad now just thinking about it. I was so uneducated about this stuff then. Take a Bradley childbirth class too. How far along are you? If you are close to delivery try laboring at home for as long as possible, because once you go to the hospital they put you on strict time restrictions (which by the way are unnatural) and will push you into another section. Get a doula!!!! And good luck!! You can do it!!!
Ke4AQ6rPaa	You can either try for a VBAC, or get your doctor to submit whatever proof the insurance co needs that the repeat C-section is "medically necessary".<br>  <br>  If you can show that the same medical condition(s) exist or the same outcome is likely this time, you can probably get the insurance company to pay for the repeat C-section.  You may even need to try and go through the motions of a VBAC and not really "schedule" the repeat C-section.<br>  <br>  It all depends on the insurance company and how picky they are, plus your doctor and how willing she is to be your advocate for this.  <br>  <br>  I had planned a VBAC, but started experiencing the same symptoms as the 1st time--going past due date, false labor but no dilation, etc.  and because of my age and medical history (emergency C-section for fetal distress) the doctor was quite open to switching to repeat C-section.  I went in for my appt @ 40 weeks with my bag packed for the hospital and pled my case, and he sent me right over to admitting and scheduled the C-section for later that day.  The insurance paid for it.  I realize that was then; this is now, and all companies are different, but I think if you can get the dr to cooperate you can get it coded as "medically necessary".<br>  <br>  |`|AA12356515	I think that is up to your doctor to determine if they are medically necessary (not you).  So, ask your doctor if they consider it necessary & what they plan on telling the insurance company (since that is who the insurance company gets their paperwork from).  Let your doctor's office deal with the insurance company & let you know what is covered & what is not.|`|ErCJnABBaa	Doctor's descresion.<br>  <br>  VBAC comes with the risk of uterine rupture.  Because of that possible risk, the doctor could easily decide the 2nd c-section was medically necessary.<br>  <br>  The only reason for VBAC is because for MOST women, uterine rupture is low enough that they can RISK trying a vaginal birth if they and their doctor feel it's safe. |`|ZhhH5cAdaa	It's so elective!<br>  <br>  It benefits the dr., the hospital and everyone else except you.<br>  <br>  they get more money for it, it's scheduled, they can go home before dinner.<br>  |`|9c8893607c79c3c2b3e1d6817da78217aa	In many hospitals they are.

Kt5nMCn1aa	Eu já teria um imenso prazer em escutar com você as músicas que você escuta.<br>  <br>  N?o vejo nada demais em escutar algo que a maioria das pessoas desprezam ou rejeitam simpesmente só porque n?o gostam. Existem muitas outras maneiras de entender uma obra musical que n?o seja apenas pelas letras das can??es.<br>  <br>  Daniela: Os seus amigos acham ridículo escutar música deste tipo simplesmente porque esta n?o faz parte da cultura que foi desenvolvida neles. Para eles entenderem seria necessário eles se submeterem a um processo muito sério de musicaliza??o onde eles poderiam aprender a escutar e respeitar a cultura de outras pessoas.<br>  <br>  Eu, por exemplo, amo música orquestrada e música intrumental. Este tipo de música também é rejeitada por muitos jovens e adolescentes que a consideram "muito chato". Este procedimento deles n?o é capaz de tirar de mim o gosto por este tipo de música e muito menos conseguem impedir que eu fique no meu cantinho só para ligar os meus aparelhos de som para escutar.<br>  <br>  Outro detalhe: O fato de gostar de musica instrumental nunca me impediu de descutar também o que essa rapaziada também gosta.<br>  <br>  Os maiores vil?es que existem para que os adolescentes e jovens da sua faixa etária desprezem o tipo de música que você gosta s?o os meios de comunica??o de massa (rádio, televis?o, jornais, revistas) e a chamada Indústria Cultural. Estes veículos colocam no mercado cultural somente coisas que d?o lucro monetário. Você pode perceber que uma música colocada no rádio hoje já n?o será mais tocada daqui a um mês.|`|DE0iGs4Jaa	Vc diz a verdade que td mundo gosta ve ouvir a musica em Inglês sem entender nada,mas cada um tem seu jeito de ouvir a musica do jeito o que for Inglês, japonês tanto faz quem sabe seu colega ouvir a musica quem sabe gosta um pouco tenho colega que ela gosta de ouvir musica japonesa mas nem ligo se ela gosta também ela já morou no Jap?o e curte muita as musica Brasileira também mesmo assim nos n?o deixou de ouvir música japonesa ela já deixou uns vídeos de japonês para mim e as minhas colegas assistir Show nem lembro o nome do grupo achei super estanho eles catando mas e normal era um grupo jovem mas achei interasante ate curte a musica depois a musica ficou na minha cabe?a achou super legal as musica japonesa mas aquela bem animada.O n?o liga o que pessoa pensa da musica curte muito ela se gostar gosta se n?o gosta fazerquee né.Mostre um video para gente quem sabe td pode gosta .Bjs|`|702F6YILaa	é isso ai eu tambem gosto de JPOP e todo mundo me acha estranho vc é a primeira pessoa que acho que gosta tambem eu tava pensando que tava ficando louco.

I have 4 as well, so trust me, a schedule won't hold up under the strain most days lol. But, in general, breakfast is at the same time every day, brushing teeth, lunch, snacks, dinner, homework, bath, bed time stories/reading and sleep. It is usually pretty much the same every day, with a little variation just because nothing ever goes exactly as planned. But anything other than that is unscripted.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	This isn't something that can be answered for you because every family is different, but I will tell you mine.<br>  7am- get daughter up and in shower (she's 5)<br>  7-7:30 -get up son (2) and do general pick up around house<br>  7:30-8:00- feed kids and get oldest on bus<br>  8:00-11:00 house work and play with son (this is when he get s to watch cartoons a little bit not the whole time)<br>  11:30-12:00 get daughter off bus, Lunch and clean up<br>  12:00-1:30 naps (even if no one is sleeping they have to be in bed and quite) this is usually where I find time to shower<br>  1:30-3:30 books and video games (we have a wii and a handheld leapster game)<br>  3:30- dinner prep<br>  4:30- daddy's home and dinner is ready<br>  5:00- go for a walk or to either of the grandparents house<br>  7:00- get jammies on and teeth brushed read books<br>  7:15- 2 yo goes down<br>  7:30- 5 yo goes down<br>  <br>  Like I said this may not work for you but I find that it is helpful for us to know what is coming next.

My kids tend to do better when they can predict how their day is going to go|`|oDgnXJB8aa	Well your six year old is in school, while you have the other three at home it would be a good idea to have each one do a project, like building blocks, coloring. If it is summer let them play under the sprinkler. <br>  Really need more imformation about what you really want to know. Are they all boys? are some girls? <br>  Breakfast, then play time, something that will really tire them down, like the park, picnic lunc,then home a good bath, then a nap with mommie.When the one get homes from school it could be some yard play or cartoon time, or even dress up play. I had five children, 12,11,10,5,and 2 two boys three girls. Had to arrange their play seperate, because boys don't like to play house, and girls don't like to play army. I found giving them old empty food containers, and play money they all like to play Store.<br>  I hope I have been of some help.<br>  <br>  Up from the nap, |`|xRiQUZt5aa	The best routine I've found is getting the kids to wake up, nap and go to bed at the same time every day. You may have to stagger bedtimes per child, but keep it consistent for each kid.<br>  <br>  Make a chart for your day. For instance, plan each hour. At 9 a.m., we play in the yard. At 10 a.m., we have a snack. At 11 a.m., we watch a video. At 11:30, we eat lunch. Then quiet time/nap time. You may not need to do it for the whole day, but structure definitely helps. Kids also really like structure. You could also plan a special day a few times each week, like Wednesday is park day and Thursday is library day, or whatever. But make sure to structure in REST and DOWNTIME. Don't overdo it on the scheduling, or you'll all go nuts.<br>  <br>  Is your 6-year-old in school yet? If at all possible, try to get at least a few of them into preschool or Mother's Day Out a day or two days a week. That will help, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oqvssqRqaa	if the 6yr. old isn't in school, you need to get him/her enrolled and that will take off some of your stress and if possible get the 4yr. old in a school also, if its only a 1/2 day that's fine, but it helps. If none of them are in school your routine should be something like this:<br>  <br>  6:00- you get up and have time just by yourself<br>  7:15-7:30- get the kids up and start breakfast<br>  8:00- baths and get on clothes for the day<br>  9:00- playtime<br>  10:00- read a book with them or arts and crafts<br>  11:00- prepare lunch<br>  11:45- put them down for a nap <br>  2:00- get them up and let them play for while or go to a park<br>  4:30- start dinner, if your husband is home let them have time w/ him<br>  5:15- sit down as a famliy and eat<br>  6:00- let your husband get them ready for bed while you clean up or vise verser<br>  7:00- as a family read a bedtime story<br>  7:45-8:00- they should be ready to go to sleep if not let them lay there and put theirselves to sleep<br>  after 8:00- youhave your husband should have time tp spend together<br>  <br>  i hope this helps and if the 6 and 4 yr old is not in  school or pre-k you should look into getting them enrolled into some kind of program. also if you dont have a discipline plan, look into one.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|U3xyzsaCaa	My father went with the early to bed, early to rise system first of all. We'd get up and would do things like make a big breakfast one day or act out a book I'd been reading or clean the house or learn some sort of math skill.<br>  <br>  Then if it was a Saturday, we could go back to bed or watch cartoons or read, just as long as we made our beds afterwards.<br>  <br>  Each day I usually spend several hours doing some outdoor activity, whether it was riding a bike or climbing a tree and reading a book. I was always told if I watched T.V. it shoudn't ever be garbage. It made a difference in the house what was on T.V. so my parents became more careful about not watching garbage either.<br>  <br>  Just remember, since your kids are young, if you can have enthusiasm about life then they will. My father would never act tired in the mornings so we didn't learn it until our school friends showed us. My mother acted excited to do chores (even though she was tired) and made it fun. That's the most important part of a routine, is everything you do should not just involve your kids, but should be fun for them. <br>  <br>  And at night we would brush our teeth, say our prayers, and do a bit of philosophical talking before bed.  |`|cAtWxJG1aa	No one can give you the routine that would work best for you, because it depends on you, your schedule around adult obligations (work, errands, etc), your kids' obligations (school start/end times, extracurriculars), their naptime, and their general rhythyms.  This is something you need to work out with some trial and error.  I'd start by blocking out nonnegotiable adult activities, school times, and sleep times (naps, bedtime).  Then consider your kids will need time for meals and snacks; bath/getting dressed/brushing teeth/ other self-care; active play (at least a couple hours, preferably even more); social play (with four they have each other, and there's play with you, too, like a board game or something, but you still want some time with friends or in some group activity); reading books (maybe some short times over the day and a longer one before bed); pretend play; quiet play (puzzles, art projects, building with blocks, etc.); maybe some music time; maybe some (disguised as pure fun) academic time like writing stories together or making rhymes or helping with cooking measurements or whatever.  You want to build in some fine motor and gross motor time among all the activities.  You also need to have some big chunks of unstructured time for them to choose what they're doing.  <br>  <br>  I have four kids, too, ages 2-9.  They wake up between 5:30 and 6:30 and cuddle and talk; get ready for school (they can play outside if they're ready early); take kids to school; my youngest usually does an activity or errands and then has a lot of playtime and reading time and snack and eventually lunch and a nap; we pick up the older kids from school and they have snack and play outside for a couple hours or have friends over or go to friends' houses; then we have an hour or so of "work time" where they do homework, chores, and practice piano; then some quiet time while dinner gets ready, when they can watch tv, play on the computer, or play indoors; then dinner; some indoor play; getting ready for bed; reading books and read-aloud; and going to bed by 8:30.

mPLXUorTaa	Actually I've read many places that 27-35 is the best time to have a baby for both the mother and the baby's health.  It's not going to be easy, nothing really makes childbirth easier.  Also, women in their late 20s and older are usually more financially and emotionally stable.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	Probably because the younger you are, the more likely you are to be fit and the faster your body can recover. I imagine that it's easier for fit 30 year old than it is for unfit 20 year old and vice versa. So not so much based on age but on each person, how fit they are, how difficult the labor is, the type of birth they have, etc.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i had my son when i was 26 and one hell of a time. i ended up with a c-section after 20hrs. of labor.|`|1uz0ngfkaa	well put it this way, dosnt matter now does it?

Xrwvu5Uraa	ummm a woman would be HOMOSEXUAL not heterosexual if she was turned on by a woman, whether pregnant or not.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	Well, it is possible for a heterosexual to be attracted to another woman pregnant or not.  In my opinion, just that does NOT make someone a homosexual.  Now if they were to act on it that's a different story.|`|3427eebd84da66693a5d9d29a3fcc54caa	A heterosexual woman is only attracted to men. <br>  <br>  So why would she be attracted to a pregnant woman? Or any woman for that matter.
lDSUQyvIaa	The thinking goes that classical music is ordered in such specific ways to stimulate logical thinking. If the baby hears patterns structured in such ways when they're young, it may stimulate them to think in such patterns and make them more intelligent. Or so goes the thinking. There isnt a lot of research to back that up and I'd say teaching your kids early and often is a better way to make them smart than playing music before they are born.
e8fa2fbd26261aed1d25efb84f86fc73aa	i am taking it right now<br>  and so is my husband<br>  no side effects<br>  <br>  first time i took it, i got pergo the next cycle<br>  <br>  now i have only been on it for 2 weeks, so i don't know if i'm prego yet.  i'm also drinking fertiliTea<br>  <br>  other ways to get prego:<br>  <br>  Have sex three times a week.<br>  <br>  Having regular sex is the best way to get pregnant. Couples often try to time everything perfectly for ovulation but do not have sex when they think they are not ovulating. It is true that sex that is not within the time of ovulation will not result in pregnancy. However, because women do not always ovulate when they think they will, having sex three times a week will help to a woman cover her bases, so to speak, and not miss an opportunity to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  2. Use an ovulation prediction kit or fertility monitor. <br>  <br>  Using an ovulation kit to predict when you are ovulating will improve your chances of getting pregnant. For many women charting or other methods of ovulation prediction are too confusing. Ovulation prediction kits work by reading LH surges prior to ovulation. They are relatively easy to use and are generally accurate for predicting ovulation. Fertility monitors, such as the Clear Blue Easy monitor, are also a worthwhile investment if you would like to get pregnant faster. Fertility monitors are similar to ovulation prediction kits in that they read changes in LH but they also read changes in other hormones and don’t require any guesswork for couples. They are easy to use and will tell you when the best time to get pregnant is.<br>  <br>  3. Have sex before ovulation (not after). <br>  <br>  Sometimes couples get confused about the best time to have sex in relationship to ovulation. You have a small window of time each month to get pregnant. After a woman ovulates the egg will survive approximately 24 hours. Sperm, on the other hand, will live for up to three to five days. This is why having sex two to three days before ovulation will increase your chances of getting pregnant. Don’t wait until the day you ovulate to have sex. Your partner’s sperm will last longer than your egg and you don’t want to miss an opportunity by waiting. <br>  <br>  4. Don’t rely on the Calendar method for predicting ovulation. <br>  <br>  A lot of couples have heard to have sex around day fourteen of your cycle. This is based on the calendar method and assumes that you have a regular 28-day cycle and ovulate mid-cycle. Although this is better than just picking an arbitrary day to have sex, it is not a very accurate way to predict when you ovulate. Many women do not ovulate on day fourteen and knowing precisely when you ovulate will help you time intercourse better. Ovulation prediction kits, looking at previous months bbt charts, or watching for body cues will help you to determine when you ovulate.<br>  <br>  5. Charting may not be the best way to predict ovulation. <br>  <br>  Charting is great for tracking your cycle but it does have disadvantages. By the time you can see ovulation on a bbt chart, you have already ovulated. It is good to chart so you can track your cycles, see if you ovulate the same time each month, and also so you can look back on your cycle and see if you timed things right. But if this is your first cycle trying to get pregnant or if you are not ovulating at the same time each month, an ovulation prediction kit would be more helpful.<br>  <br>  6. See a doctor before you start trying to get pregnant. <br>  Make sure you are in good health and have had a regular check up from your OBGYN or medical provider. Untreated infections, sexually transmitted diseases, or poor health can affect your chances of getting pregnant. Its good to see a doctor as well as start taking prenatal vitamins prior to trying to conceive.<br>  <br>  7. Don’t smoke, drink alcohol, or abuse drugs when trying to get pregnant. <br>  This may seem like common sense but many women do try to get pregnant while smoking, drinking or using drugs. Smoking, drugs, and alcohol can affect your fertility. It will also affect your unborn child. It is important to stop smoking or using drugs and alcohol before getting pregnant and not wait until you find out you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  8. Have enjoyable sex.<br>  <br>  Sometimes when couples are trying to conceive, sex becomes a job or function of reproduction and is not as enjoyable. Plan a romantic evening or try something different to spice things up. How you are feeling sexually may factor into your chances of getting pregnant. Some researchers believe that having an orgasm during sex increases your chances of getting pregnant. For women, the spasmic movements of orgasm will help pull the sperm into the uterus and for men a better orgasm may increase the man’s sperm count.<br>  <br>  9. Have sex in positions that keep sperm inside the vagina longer.<br>  <br>  The missionary position is a good position to use when trying to get pregnant. Avoid positions where the woman is on top. Gravity will allow sperm to leak out with these positions. Also try placing a pillow under your hips to help tilt your pelvis and keep the sperm in longer. Don’t get up right after sex. Try to relax and allow the sperm to stay in the vagina as long as possible.<br>  <br>  10. There is no such thing as trying too hard to get pregnant.<br>  Most couples get pregnant within a year of trying. If you have not gotten pregnant within a year consult your doctor for advice.|`|cb063eb20a605b09164eaf9d59750a28aa	it did not work for me!-but it may work for u so try it <br>  <br>  Good Luck**************
fth1uDi9aa	Everyone is unique and it very much depends on your hormone levels and how these were effected by the pill. Remember it takes twelve months to make a baby, it takes three months for you to ripen an egg ready for fertilization and three months for your partner to grow a sperm. Some people are on the pill for years and as soon as they stop manage to get pregnant. However, it is more likely that once they stop the pill it takes a few months for the hormones and the cycle to get back into step. While you are on the pill you do not have true periods just break through bleeding. The pill tries to fool your body into thinking that you are pregnant. Sorry to be so vague but without a detailed hormone profile for the month, temperature chart it is unlikely that anyone could tell for sure.
2zC1lpfVaa	Don't know what your mean by "4 days since i was fertile".  Do you mean since you ovulate?  Light bleeding 4 days after fertilization may be implantation bleeding... But heavy bleeding... seems to be some imbalance hormone problem and you just got your period ealy this time?.
ORluWHGAaa	Go to your doctor and do a blood test|`|IGcS9K62aa	Get another test and take it in the morning when your hormone levels would be the highest.

I suggest you visit your ob-gyne as soon as possible.|`|pvDVFrKwaa	You might want to see a doctor to get a professional test done. Taking birth control irregularly messes with your cycle alot and if you messed up the cycle and accidently made it skip your last period that maybe.

I'd say take another test and if that is negative bring it up to a doctor|`|TbtLSDPhaa	no more babys nooooo

4SjnlXgkaa	Hi any news yet? That is so great. I hope that everything goes well this time and you have a happy and healthy baby! Just try to take it as easy as possible and don't stress yourself out too much.I know that this will be hard after the experience you had last time but it is in the babies best interest to have as little stress as possible. I know this sounds weird but reading all of your questions has really touched me and it was as if I relived my past miscarriage and following pregnancy. Keep in touch and update me with your progress!|`|4uzxCifgaa	Well I also had a DNC and misccaried. Remeber that for next weeks your body will still have a high hormone level, some women take longer and other shorter time to get back to normal. If you havent had your period then there has not been ovulation yet, so it might not be possible you are pregnant. But remember anything can happen and when it meant to be its mean to be. GOOD LUCK TO YOU.....
4uzxCifgaa	Well I know the doctor recommend to wait a bout 3 months, But I know parents that have started trying right away and gotten pregnant and had a baby perfectly. I guess it would also depend on your medical history regrading the abortion it would be better for you to ask your doctor just in case. Good Luck to you.|`|PoAiGIUDaa	Im sorry about your abortion :(<br>  I would check with your doctor just to be safe! Good luck and lots of baby dust to you ttc!

Don't give the child a funky spelling. Just spell it normally so she doesn't have the aggravation of constantly correcting the spelling when she is older.

She will thank you later.<br>  |`|Ny11t23Haa	Honestly, for the sake of your future daughter, I don't think any of those are any good.

Coc593Ikaa	Here is the information for the US. Check the link, it is a nice table that summarizes laws by state quite nicely. The second link is a table devoted entirely to late-term abortions. It is very informative.<br>  <br>  Except for life or health endangerment, abortions can be performed up to 20 weeks in the earliest restriction (NC) and up to 24 weeks, "viablity" or the third trimester in most other states.<br>  <br>  "HIGHLIGHTS:<br>  ???? 36 states prohibit some abortions after a certain point in pregnancy.<br>  ???? 23 states initiate prohibitions at fetal viability.<br>  ???? 5 states initiate prohibitions in the third trimester.<br>  ???? 8 states initiate prohibitions after a certain number of weeks, generally 24."<br>  <br>  ADD: Be aware, that if the mother's life or "health" is in danger, in many cases an abortion can still be performed even later.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	The farthest age in weeks where abortion is still allowed (in certain states in the USA) is 24 weeks. It's sick, disgusting and sad to have one that late, imo. I think most other states offer them up to 15 weeks, but I'm not 100% sure on that.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	in most areas, abortion is no longer legal at 24 weeks. most clinics however don't perform abortions beyond 12-14 weeks.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Depends on where you live.<br>  <br>  France: 12 weeks<br>  Germany: 12 weeks<br>  Italy: 13 weeks<br>  Sweden: 18 weeks<br>  US: Some limitations at 26 weeks<br>  Australia: No limits<br>  UK: 26 weeks|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	20 weeks is the latest, some states have the limit set at 12 or 16 weeks, though in the case of saving the mother's life it is possible to have a late-term abortion.
VWvI5RyBaa	They do it all the time for breech babies when it's early enough.  I had three babies, three breeches but they all became breech the last week of the pregnancy so it was too late to turn the baby.  I was expecting my second on a 26th and on the 22nd the doctor realized that he had the cord around his neck and was breech, I had an emergency c-section.  My third one turned on a Sunday night while I was watching the tv and I told my husband, the baby decided to be another breech.  I had an appointment with the gynaecologist the next day and I didn't say anything.  He examined me and told me to go for an ultrasound, he said he thought it was another breech.  Then I told him what happened.  By the way I was a breech too when I was born.  They say it's not genetic but I beg to differ LOL|`|sYsfI856aa	I've heard of it being done. There are ways to move the baby into a different position if necessary. I've heard it can be painful for the mother though to have the baby moving so much in a short time.|`|2GXgT981aa	I've never heard of it being done for that reason, but I've heard of them externally trying to turn breech babies around to a head-down position.  It's not always terribly successful because the uterine muscles are pretty strong.

04b12dc4f30be58ea95ac201b41f497baa	I have two kids in daycare full time M-F 9 hours a day and my day care provider charges us $2/hour per child and we pay her bi-weekly.  Our previous day care charged $2.65/hour for toddler/preschool age and $3.10 per hour for infant/baby and we paid them bi-weekly.|`|6e64a8e419e3d1ef3ce8f7805f3dac7baa	It all depends on where you live and what type of care you need. My wife watches kids in our home and charges $30 a day for 6-9 hours a day. Weekends would be $50 a day. Weekly payments are best for both parties involved so no one gets screwed either way.|`|d59f3ab95b2234fd41ac4dba05f04b7faa	I'm a nanny, and I have worked in the field for years.  It really depends on where you live.  Ask other parents in the area what the going rate is.  If you don't know any other parents, look for your community online (most larger communities have their own website) and ask on there.<br>  As far as a payment schedule goes, make it either weekly or bi-weekly...whatever suits you best.  Most nannys will think it ridiculous to be paid daily, and it is the law in most places that you must be paid at least twice monthly.|`|d86397c5741ce75598fa744b94b9a6bbaa	Depends on what all you did.  If you were really good, meaning that you played with the kids, read them stories, cleaned any dishes you used, picked up toys, and left the house in the order you found it, then I would pay you whatever day you would like (most like daily), and I would give you a good wage.  But if you just came in, plopped down on the couch, watched TV, and only interacted with the children when they were hungry and didn't bother to clean up afterwards, then you would get whatever I gave you on whichever day I choose.  All depends on your work ethic.|`|ef0ed525ed7d64200b660db3f07a674caa	I would not go below $10/hour some sitters may be more qualified than others and in that case I would pay up to $12 for the one baby. We started paying our nanny at the beginning of every month, at her request, so she was getting one payment per month. About 6 months ago we switched and now are paying her weekly. We all agree (my husband, our nanny and myself) that the weekly payments are a lot easier for everyone. <br>  <br>  For the weekends when our nanny works for us we throw in some extra money depending on how long she was there since she is giving up her weekend to work for us. We also have friends who just increase the hourly rate for the weekend time since it is basically like over time.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out!|`|f0188d968b7e8aeb51156360a9f2fae5aa	BI-WEEKLY WOULD BE BEST.|`|3839826a820c2501aa3fcc463460c189aa	weekly $350|`|AA11610212	i personally like weekly paychecks

AA11378610	During pregnancy active women often wish to continue with their exercise program. For others, pregnancy signals a time to improve their life style. For these women beginning exercise during pregnancy is desirable. Moderate physical activity has major health benefits. Regular exercise is preferable to intermittent activity. Active Australia recommends that every Australian should accumulate 30 minutes or more of moderate intensity physical activity on, at least, most days of the week (usually interpreted as five sessions per week) (Bauman, 1997). <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  In the past concerns arose regarding the safety of exercising during pregnancy. It was common for various restrictions to be placed on women exercising in pregnancy. However, as the research evidence grows, these restrictions are lifting and a more personalised approach is being adopted. The emerging picture is that in most cases there is no need for healthy women to change their exercise program during conception and early pregnancy. Some adaptations are required as the pregnancy advances. It is important to note that prior to commencing any exercise program, it is wise to seek the advise of a midwife or doctor. Occasionally there are factors that indicate women should not exercise in pregnancy. When planning an exercise program, it is of great benefit to see a qualified fitness professional. A fitness professional can offer guidelines and a training program to suit the individual woman and her pregnancy (Clapp, 1998).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  What are the benefits of exercise during pregnancy?<br>  <br>  There are many benefits of exercising during pregnancy that have been identified. Benefits include: increased body awareness, increased endurance, improved posture, helps prevent gestational diabetes, lower physical discomforts associated with pregnancy, increased sense of well being, less fatigue, improved muscle tone, improved body image, active phase of labour is shorter, less forceps and caesarean births and physically fit women recover more quickly after birth (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1994; Clapp, 1998; Sternfeld, 1997).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  What guidelines should a pregnant woman follow while exercising?<br>  <br>  <br>  Stop exercising and consult a midwife or doctor if bleeding, cramping, faintness, dizziness or severe joint pain.<br>  <br>  <br>  Women should avoid laying flat on their backs after sixteen weeks. As the uterus grows it can compress a major blood vessel when a woman lies flat on her back. This restricts blood flow back to the mother’s heart and subsequently the blood flow to the baby.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is important to exercise sensibly at a comfortable intensity and do not exercise to exhaustion or at an anaerobic (or breathless) pace.<br>  <br>  <br>   Avoid overheating. This is particularly important in the first trimester when the baby is most vulnerable to high temperatures. Wear light comfortable clothing, drink plenty of water, avoid exercising in very hot temperatures and do not exercise during illness or fever.<br>  <br>  <br>   Avoid any sport where there is a risk of abdominal blow eg. down hill skiing, horse riding, contact sports<br>  <br>  <br>   Avoid holding breath during exercise.<br>  <br>  <br>  All exercise should be accompanied by an appropriate warm up and cool down session. (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1994; Clapp, 1998; Sternfeld, 1997).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  What factors would exclude me from exercising?<br>  <br>  Do not exercise if any of the following are present:<br>  <br>  <br>  Pregnancy induced hypertension<br>  <br>  <br>  Ruptured membranes<br>  <br>  <br>  Incompetent cervix<br>  <br>  <br>  Vaginal bleeding<br>  <br>  <br>  Interuterine growth retardation<br>  <br>  <br>  A multiple pregnancy<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  There are a number of other medical and obstetric conditions that may lead to the need to modify or stop an exercise program. This is why it is wise to consult a midwife or doctor so they can assess the appropriateness of beginning or continuing with an exercise program in pregnancy (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1994).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  What types of food should I eat while on an exercise program?<br>  <br>  It is ideal for a pregnant women to avoid letting blood sugar levels fall to low levels (this can increase feelings of nausea and dizziness). These easiest way to avoid this happening is by eating small meals often (around every three hours). Foods that help avoid sudden decreases in blood sugar include salad vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grain breads and pasta. Avoid foods that contains carbohydrates (sugars) that are absorbed quickly and can cause blood sugar levels to decrease in as little as an hour after eating them. Foods in this category include refined products such as white bread, most cereals, cakes, biscuits, lollies, chips and most other snack foods. Avoid eating for two hours prior to an exercise session. Have a small snack immediately after an exercise session. If you exercise first thing in the morning, have a liquid snack while exercising then follow this with breakfast after the exercise session has ended (Clapp, 1998).<br>  <br>  <br>  by<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dhaarvi.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dhaarvi.blogspot.com</a>|`|kn5O6QpXaa	try light exercise....   low impact aerobic|`|8jJ0pwnsaa	It will probably have an adverse effect on your child's development...<br>  Babies start as a single cell and multiply rapidly, so all the days it can develop in a comfortable environment is crucial.<br>  You should probably take it easy for the babies sake...

5ce149e97f9439b4c9b19344f25abbfdaa	It doesn't sound like you actually got sick from the peanut butter, but to give you peace of mind you should probably throw it out.<br>  <br>  The recall was due to salmonella. Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning, and in very rare cases can be fatal (elderly people are most likely to die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Contracting salmonella during pregnancy rarely harms the baby directly. <br>  <br>  However, if you're still concerned a simple culture can be taken that will test for salmonella. Your doctor can order the test for you. You can alert your doctor to the fact that you've eaten potentially tainted peanut butter and see if he/she thinks that they should order a test.|`|AA11657209	Dont worry about that unless you start getting sick. I ate the peanut butter that was recalled too and so did my kids and mom and none of us got sick and that was a little while back.|`|0nCFxNLdaa	I would say unless you got sick you should be fine. Most doctors say you should have symptoms within 3 days of eating the infected peanut butter. We had a tub of the peanut butter that was affected and most of it had been eaten and no one in our house got sick.  If you start to feel ill I would call the doctor right away.|`|beb4e0c67ce4c4c1b529a49e879560c2aa	Ummmmm go to truth or fiction.com and there is the article its okay to eat i think, but i don't remember. that site answers rumors about everything!

I hope you get the result you want.|`|Sgwxtl0taa	I dont really know how everyone feels but I was really sleepy and I was slacking on cleaning which I never did before.

Good Luck!|`|wmTmRICZaa	You can take a test if your period is late. or update your question with the reasons you think that you might be pregnant, then some of us might be able to help you more.
m7c5hK0Faa	I think you should try and cut down slowly, this way there isnt too much stress on you or your embryos.  If this cycle doesnt work then the months break would be a good chance to really try and cut out the cigarettes all together.  Be strong!!|`|10519d316adbc188d750e1f892235828aa	It is dangerous for the embryo to be smoking|`|0dc66a217261bbb98ebd895700c60617aa	I have had the same question before. My doctor told me that if I hadn't stopped smoking before I got pregnant than it would be best to have a blood test to see where the hormone levels were at. Once they reached a level of 100,000 or more, than it would be good to quit then, but not before. An embryo is very fragile, and if you get pregnant while smoking, then it is harmful (but not extremely so) to smoke for a week or two more. That way it can start implanting and growing in it's familiar environment. After it gets far enough, then lessen smoking, and then quit. Sudden changes are harmful to a developing baby in the first three weeks.<br>  <br>  I also asked my family doctor, and told him what my gyno said, and he agreed. They both warned that smoking while pregnant is not good for the baby though. <br>  <br>  And another fun fact, which you probably know, is that smoking can cause infertility. Smoking directly triggers certain chemicals in the brain, which are the ones that effect ovarian function. <br>  <br>  Several websites are really helpful about this issue. www.webmd.com and www.babycenter.com.  Good Luck!!!!|`|3723e55b7dfb30e4ca7be7f2889f4787aa	I smoked until i found out i was preggers, i must have been 6 weeks gone when i found out.  Obviously i quit soon as i knew and my pregnancy went fine and my son who is now 7 is perfectly healthy.  When your baby is growing inside you, it will give you the strength to quit without patches or gum.  Maternal instincts will kick in and to keep your baby safe and healthy will become your main priority, trust me :) good luck and don't worry x|`|7QnX0bNYaa	Specifically on the embryo, i doubt anything.  Before smoking was largely demonized in the media, people smoked all through their pregnancy.  I'm sorry you flag waiving non-smokers that have to force your opinion down other peoples throat at every opportunity.  There are some things that have never been proven as fact so dont make things up.  I'll give you lung cancer and heart problems.  <br>  <br>  Your real issue here is trying to tackle two very stressful things at once. I'm guessing this is the first time you've ever quit smoking? <br>  <br>  You can expect about 3-7 days of strong withdrawl symptoms.  If you smoked a lot, you need to start on the Step 1 patch too.  You have to be very careful to not get addicted to the patch though.  Especially not get additcted to the patch and start smoking again.<br>  <br>  I really think you should hold off on the implant procedures until you feel better about the smoking ordeal.  It seriously is a very bad time to do it all at once.  Have you talked to your doctor about xyban or other prescription drugs that can help quit smoking?  That might be something i strongly suggest if you havent yet.<br>  <br>  I've quit smoking 3 times.  The first one only stuck 3 months.  2nd one 4 months.  Now i'm on my third time and I'm much more confident in that I knew what to expect.  Nightmares from using the patch.  Withdrawls and how to handle them, how long the craving lasts, what triggers it for me.. Its really something you need to make it through at least once before you can be successful.  I think i've read someplace that it really takes about 2-4 times of attempting to quit before it actually sticks.<br>  <br>  The other reason I think you should hold off, because I had to deal with pregnant girl 2 years ago is that you get a massive change in the way your brain is wired.  I'm sure some of the other women on here can tell you all about that.  All i know is its not easy to deal with.  If you stack the quit-smoking thing on top of it you have huge problems that are likely going to be more than you and your husband can deal with.<br>  <br>  Tackle the smoking first.  wait a couple months and if you're ok at that point then try for the baby again.  I really dont recommend quitting and getting pregnant at the same time.  You can also email me if you want to know anything else specific about it
0dc66a217261bbb98ebd895700c60617aa	I have been trying to get pregnant for 4 years, so I know what you are going through. If you haven't tried Clomid for 6 months, then do that. Talk to your doctor about it. <br>  <br>  If you have done that, and they say your eggs aren't strong enough, ask them how to make them strong enough. My eggs aren't big enough, or strong enough, so I know exactly what you are feeling. <br>  <br>  Before pregnancy there are several things you can do to help, and won't get in the way of what your doctor prescribes. First, make sure your immunizations are up to date for you and your partner. Also go to the dentist. (Sounds weird I know, but any type of gum disease or high chances of one can affect you and a baby!) Start taking folic acid!! You can take just a folic acid supplement, but I suggest using a over-the-counter pre-natal vitamin. ($4 at Walmart)  Make sure your diet is baby friendly. If you smoke, drink, or do drugs then quit! (Your partner too.)<br>  <br>  Go back to your doctor. If you feel like he/she isn't helping or listening to you, then see another one. Also be honest with them about everything. Make sure you tell them everything, even the smallest thing, so they can help you. <br>  <br>  If you aren't charting, you should be. Even if you don't take your temp. everyday, then you need to be keeping track of your sex and cycles. I suggest keeping a list of these things (including the dates) of when you start and stop your period, when you have sex, what position you ended up in, and how many orgasm's that you have. (A female orgasm helps sperm mobility. The contracting muscles help the sperm swim towards the egg.)<br>  <br>  Also, if you haven't had a laproscopy surgery to see what is going on inside, then ask for one. It is out-patient, and doesn't hurt much at all. It can also show them exactly what is going on inside of your body. It will also help them see your ovaries in person, not through an ultrasound. If your eggs are weak, then you have to have a problem with your ovaries, or a chemical that your ovary produces. Surgery, which is minimal, for this is standard procedure. <br>  <br>  Also make sure your partner's sperm are strong and good. A simple sperm count can tell you tons of things. <br>  <br>  Even with weak eggs, as long as your tubes are open and functioning, then with the right fertility drugs (Clomid, etc) you should be able to conceive if you time it right. <br>  <br>  Here are some website to look at. Write down all of your questions, look these sites over, and go see your doctor. If they can't help you, then they should tell you who can. Good luck!<br>  <br>  www.fertilethoughts.net<br>  www.resolve.org<br>  www.babycenter.com<br>  www.webmd.com<br>  www.asrm.org|`|m7c5hK0Faa	I would go and see a specialist.  They will put you on a drug called Clomid (or similar) which are taken in tablet form on day 2 through to day 6 of your cycle.  The clomid sends messages to your pituitary gland in your brain telling it that there is not enough oestrogen (oestrogen is responsible for developing healthy eggs).  Your body then produces more oestrogen which in turn creates larger follicles (eggs) and increases your chance of conception.  It is definitely worth reading up on, a little knowledge doesn't hurt anyone.

GMtDGPjvaa	All of my kids have gone through that...once it isn't something new anymore, he will stop. With my oldest I used to freak out, and wonder why she was doing that. My youngest does that too, she is almost 5 months old.|`|AA11765949	Babies do loose their first hair maybe he is just touching his hair while this happening and it looks like he is pulling it out. If he was doing it, it would be hurting him and he would cry. Make sure he dosn't put it in his mouth.|`|AA10636233	Both my girls did that. They would discover they had hair, then grab hold of it, and pull, then realize it hurt and scream, then pull all the harder because their bodies haven't learned the signals yet that say pain means let go. I resorted to long socks on their hands, because the baby mittens were too easy to remove. the socks have that thick elastic band, and they couldn't get them off nearly as easily. They couldn't feel the hair, or keep hold of it , so they stopped pulling. Hope this helps!|`|eRyVH2wMaa	He feels his hair he doesnt know what it is and of course its only natural for a baby to pull at stuff just move his hand away when he starts to pull at his hair. Or put him a hat on|`|fbbc4cf608f15e5a0a5e9311c1aae94aaa	It is natural. Your baby is just exploring his own body. The next thing he may do is nibble on his own fingers or pull his toungue. If you are worried he might injure himself or something, do try shaving his hair off.

TYRRjIv4aa	Wow i love your names! So cute! They all flow wonderfully together. I like the name Bethany but do not fancy the nickname of Beth. I think it's really plain and would not work well with your other unique names. Here are some middle name suggestions with Bethany anyways: :)<br>  <br>  Bethany Elisabeth<br>  Bethany Abigail<br>  Bethany Marie <br>  Bethany Taylor<br>  Bethany Shiloh<br>  Bethany Giselle<br>  Bethany Morgan<br>  Bethany Angeline<br>  Bethany Nicole<br>  Bethany Isabel<br>  Bethany Gabriella|`|6hb04Ow0aa	I personally wouldn't use it, but it's still pretty. Bethany and Heather are pretty similar to me in that they have a soft kind of look to them, so Heather might be an ideal middle name. And Heather isn't unique, but pretty uncommon where I live anyway. I also think Bethany Morgan goes really well! It goes well with the others, too. I'm also not planning on having any kids for a long time but I loove picking out names :)|`|61NKzPzMaa	My sisters middle name is Bethany. I like it.<br>  <br>  Landon Jeremiah is lovely.<br>  Christopher Mason is much nicer than Kristopher Mason.<br>  Arabella Rachel is much nicer than Arabella Rachelle.<br>  Evangline is lovely but Harlow is a masculine BOYS name.|`|rvSrjNeQaa	Evan Lendal !!|`|HqEdWTfIaa	ummm i dont really like harlow...but my sisters name is shea (shay) and that goes good with alot of names. and it is pretty for a middle name too. if i have another kid thats what i was going to use for my kids middle name if its a girl. i have a 4 month old right now and im almost 20....but i think it is cool you want to plan ahead for names. the hard thing is getting the dad to agree with them lol.|`|BMt8jcTwaa	Kristopher Mason is so so cutee i luv itt*|`|fPJTZwoUaa	i like the name bethany <br>  arabella is plain horrible <br>  harlow ireminds me of harlot <br>  <br>  if ur only 16 why are u worrying about this nw  u got plenty of time|`|6Swq0iEPaa	Bethany would not be a personal choice of mine but I love the name Beth, especially from Elisabeth. I think Bethany would be paired well with a name of its' own origin, which is Hebrew, like Aaron, Ben, or Ginelle. Though, out of your own names, I like Jeremiah and Evangeline
kc2Sa7ibaa	Count sheep :) lol That doesn't help...<br>  <br>  They say if you get up and get a drink every 15 - 30 minutes or go for a short walk it will help. Try reading.

owsegtUZaa	Definitely!! That sounds exactly like pregnancy to me. You need to take a test. You can get them at the dollar stores or even from your hospital for free usually. It will be good for you to find out asap!!!<br>  <br>  There are so many different signs of pregnancy and you definitely have some. I would say you are going to start your period but you are 5 weeks late. either you are having menstral cycle problems and you need to see your doctor or you are indeed prego! either way,,,contact your doctor asap.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything! And make sure that if you are, that you inform these guys. It would be a smart idea.<br>  <br>  16 is young....but I know of some women that had babies that young and have a great family now. But be careful from here on out. there's a lot to experience!|`|g32pZrISaa	Did you have sex? you could be pregnant.  Congratulations in advance.|`|pjRWlczXaa	It's very possible.  Get a pregnancy test to find out for sure.|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	Yes you could possibly be|`|3427eebd84da66693a5d9d29a3fcc54caa	All those signs, are signs of Pregnancy. And five weeks late would be when a woman would start experiencing nausea and breast soreness. <br>  <br>  If you are five weeks late, and you are pregnant, you'll HCG level will be high enough for a home pregnancy test to detect it. <br>  <br>  <br>  So is this with the guy you want to be with, that you're parents don't like? Or some random guy you met at the 7-11?<br>  <br>  BTW its a bad idea to post a topic saying you want to be pregnant by a man, and then a few moments later post a topic where you say you slept with two guys the month before.<br>  <br>  Just sayin'|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	uhhh of course it sounds like you have symptoms of being pregnant.<br>  <br>  you should take a test...or go to your doctor.<br>  <br>  nobody on y/a knows if you are pregnant or not, but like I said the symptoms you have listed could be signs. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|Azp6bBazaa	youre 16 & had sex with 2 at the same time?? <br>  am i right? <br>  youre sick. seriously youre 16 you shouldnt be having sex anyways.<br>  but they make these things called pregnancy tests, go buy one.<br>  you can get them for $2 @ the dollar store. <br>  follow directions & good luck. <br>  if it says neg. then you need to inform your parents & see the doctor. <br>  <br>  and if youre not pregnant get on birth control.

AA10736763	We adopted our four year old foster child, so I have some experience in that area.  <br>  Basically, if you want to adopt, you have to have a home study done FIRST.  If you adopt through the state, then they pay for all that.  Then there has to be an attorney for the birthmother, adoptive parents, and the child.  It has to all go through court.<br>  I have written several articles on adoption and fostering, if you are interested.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/user/150807/carla_raley.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/user/15...</a>|`|1ZIWC8iWaa	It would be great if you adopted a child at that age because he/she would be easier to handle and can already walk, eat and is potty trained. It would also be great if you adopted another one after so that your first child would not be lonely and both of them have someone to play with. The only problem is finding the right child and all the paper work is a hassle but it would be very much worth it.

If none of these, give your pediatrician a call.|`|62hGVNhoaa	Sounds like night terrors, she is becoming aware of the world around her and her brain is trying to make sense of it all while she sleeps.<br>  Not alot you can do except reassure her and wait until she outgrows this phase.<br>  |`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	Night terrors. Being a mother of older children, I can certainly say that that is is one phase that I DON'T miss!<br>  This happens in a state of sleep that slips partially out of sleep and is strange and confusing for the child, causing her to get terrified and cry out, but not really knowing why. Quite often, children who experience night terrors don't fully wake up, even when they are picked up and cuddled and can often continue screaming for several minutes before settling right back down to sleep. <br>  Children who experience night terrors normally seem to have no recollection of the episode the next morning, though can somethings appear anxious. <br>  What can cause them? Sometimes a change in her life or daily routine can upset her unconscious mind and cause her to react in her sleep. Sometimes it can be caused by too much stimulation during the day or close to bed time. Sometimes night terrors can be triggered by something as simple as a change in diet. <br>  However, as upsetting as these episodes are, night terrors are perfectly normal and the child usually grows out of them without lasting effects.<br>  Sweet dreams to you. |`|jLXyKYzBaa	my little boy used to wake up screaming, i used to feel so helpless but he did grow out of it, as long as he knows your there dont worry! he is 9 now and he is a very light sleeper. think every child is different, i also think sometimes when they go to sleep there brain is still goin and maybe thats why they dream alot??? good luck and dont worry|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	This is where I tell all the goody two shoes who say persist...leave her to cry...etc, to get lost! My kids did this, I had them in with me...they grew out of it. I think it is just a stage...they are becoming aware of the world, active brains giving them weird dreams...all they need is reassurance and to know you are there.|`|d2YvAtOjaa	My niece (who lives with me) started doing this at about the same age, I assumed it must be bad dreams but it did worry me as she was in such a state when she woke up it would take a long time to calm her down. <br>  <br>  We put a lamp in her bedroom and it stopped almost immediately, I think it is either a fear of the dark or not being able to recognise where they are when they wake up.<br>  We are now having a similar problem as she is in a bed and can get out when she wakes in this night, she is happy on her own in her room with the light but gets hysterical as soon as she opens her bedroom door because its dark outside!<br>  <br>  We now have nightlights on the landing and in my bedroom too!<br>  |`|e69eadb67f7b4293d10244929db51c6aaa	Pray with her and give her assurance that though u may not always be  there in her room, but there is a heavenly father, God, who watches over her and wont let her get hurt. <br>  Also watch what programs she watches on TV avoid scary movies and even some scary puppets.<br>  If she has books read her soothing happy ending stories at bedtime. Bible stories are great examples of how God sees when nobody does and how much he cares for us all.You can read her Bible stories too, Get her a children Bible.<br>  Make her as happy as possible but dont spoil her during the day.<br>  <br>  |`|w1Nq75J6aa	i had this problem with my son hes 18 months old now but when he was 10 months onwards he used to wake twice a night and scream for no reason for over an hour and then hed go back to sleep<br>  i asked my doctor and he said it was night terrors  |`|BEfzasqhaa	Have a doctor check her out,  calpol???  play some southing music
4V4m2uZ5aa	I'd take it, but I'm impatient. I always took my tests early with both my kids and they came out positive.<br>  Just remember that if it comes out neg you could still be pg, so don't get discouraged.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10967880	i would wait 3 days after you were due and go to the doctors a week after your due date|`|1CryEnb3aa	Symptoms sound like they could be for either poss pregnancy or PMS. I would wait til the 25th and no AF, take the test.  Good luck and baby dust!!:)|`|GjuRYsITaa	it may show the result now its only 3 days till your due
OxFV92hJaa	I am there now actually!<br>  <br>  I just last week met my 1/2 sister for the first time!!!! Sorry, but I'm still stoked beyond all belief!<br>  <br>  I always knew about her, from the time my mom was pregnant with me and on. She was "lost" from the time my mom was 6 months pregnant till a week ago. I'm 22, she turns 29 on March 10th. <br>  <br>  She knew about me, but not my brother. Her mom lied about everything down the line...and she has taken things a lot harder than my brother or I. We kept photos (age newborn to 6 years old, last time she was seen) around and all. She was from my dads first marriage, and he tried very hard to make sure that we knew we had a sister somewhere. We searched for 23 years and finaly found her! <br>  <br>  I have no idea why someone would keep that type thing a secret, it isn't fair....and it hurts a lot more than it helps. That's for sure. <br>  <br>  I cherish the old photos of me in my room at 10 years old with the picture of my sister on my dresser. All of those dreams and thoughts about her, it's something that I cherish. But because she was lied to, it's something that hurts her, deeply. What do you do with that? lol<br>  <br>  Just be honest people! Life happens, don't "break" a child because of your own issues. Just tell the damn truth, and let life happen.|`|TlFnIei0aa	I just found out I had a brother (well I found out 2 years ago).<br>  I think my dad hid it because<br>  1. he was ebarraced he had a 1 night stand with a druggy<br>  2. he regretted not having anything to do with him<br>  <br>  I'm not mad I didn't know, I was curious for a while, but I respect my dads decision not to tell me.|`|ogdm7RLYaa	I don't know how I was told..but I have always known that I have had an older half-sister that I have I have yet to meet...<br>  <br>  I sometimes wish I didn't know...because when I think about it, like now, it makes me sad that I don't know her :(<br>  <br>  Just my little story, not really an answer...|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	How come parents don't give kids the low down of their whole history at age 5? BECAUSE some shi t needs to be learned later in life. Should we not let children believe in Santa Clause or the Easter Bunny? I would let them know later, when they are mature.|`|cbWfIKaYaa	They must have a good reason for keeping it away from everyone and have their reason for not wanting the children to know about each other.I don't know what I would do if I were in a situation like that, it would probably depend upon the circumstances and people involved. <br>  <br>  Also remember a family isn't necessarily related by blood. They are the people who love you most and will be there for you through anything. This other child may have been better off with the family they have now.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Honestly, I wouldn't care if I had some long lost sibling out there.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? I've wondered this too. I could never keep it a secret. I would want everyone aware I had another child. But honestly, if I found out I had a sister or brother out there, and my parents withheld it for me for a while, I would understand on a level, and just accept the years we lost. I would be grateful to know from that point on though. ?¤·?|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Because that is what it is...a secret.They want to ignore the past even though the past is imprinted and you cannot erase it.<br>  <br>  I've always wondered if I had a long lost sibling (or a sibling nobody just knows about) I would be pissed if I found out about him/her years later too.
gx4s68s8aa	I did- and it was the best choice I ever made.  It is best if you do it early though.  Some doctors will not take you if you are in the middle of your pregnancy (some even earlier than that)  My first doctor came highly recommended.  However, after one appointment I knew, and she knew that it would not work out at all.  I then interviewed to other doctors.  And I found the perfect one for me.  She was very new to the area, so she didn't have many patients, however, I think we you meet the right doctor for you, then you know it very quickly.<br>  <br>  When you are pregnant having the right doctor is so much more important than almost any other doctor you will ever have.  Pregnancy is such a personal thing that the relationship you have with your doctor can really impact how your pregnancy goes.  So find the doctor that is right for you.  Good luck|`|28VX3LaNaa	Yes- you can change at anytime. |`|AA12358335	I'm extremely lucky - I LOVE LOVE LOVE my doctor. <br>  <br>  But you can ABSOLUTELY change doctors if you aren't comfortable with your OB! Start asking around for recommendations from friends and family who have babies and ask them the pros and cons of their doctor. <br>  <br>  This is a big time for you medically, physically and mentally - if you're not comfortable with your caregiver, don't hesitate to find one you ARE comfortable with!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|P7VdWn7baa	I did not like my doctor, up to 4 months pregnant, he was a very good doctor.. But he had no bed side matter, so I went to a all women's clinic, which i felt more comfortable. so yes you can change.. But if your to far along they might not take you. GL|`|VT0YGdK2aa	Change your Dr. if you arent comfortable.  I was unhappy with my prenatal Dr. so I made sure another Dr. would be available during delivery.  Best thing I did for myself and my baby|`|PYySLOw6aa	I am pregnant right now and I love my doctor but if you dont like yours call the office and change! if you dont feel comforable I would switch offices! good luck!|`|UDA0PioRaa	I am using a midwife and I really like her.  Now if you are 38 weeks pregnant with a complicated pregnancy and decide you just want to change, I would say- no, let's stick this one out.  But otherwise there is absolutely no reason why you can't change.  If you are a difficult patient and live in a small town where all the doctors know each other, you may have trouble finding a new physician.  But if you are leaving for legitimate reasons- then you should have nothing to worry about.|`|zHJm18rKaa	I did not like my doctor with my first two (10 years apart) so I switched. You have to be comfortable with your doctor and it is absolutely your right to switch if you're not. Good luck to you.|`|SrCV4UtSaa	Sure you can... First make sure it would not cause any problems with your insurance or anything like that. If your insurance has some red tape for you then make sure you get the proper procedure to get your coverage transferred. |`|KU1JnxBUaa	you can change your doctor whenever you like just ask to see some 1 else. i changed my midwife half way through labor because she was a bit too mouthy for my liking |`|yQWnMSc6aa	I changed my doctor in the first trimester. He was my GYN but he made me feel uncomfortable as my OB. It was the best thing I did. |`|Fm3L8vsYaa	i love mine but you can change at any time. |`|mHtlWYJNaa	I changed doctors at 20 weeks.... so thankful!!! I love my new doctor. She is awesome! 
b6EyFLgUaa	now im not good at the planning or anything lol but what I can say is it took me 6 weeks to get a positive test. DROVE ME CRAZY. So you may be but just have a negative test.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	Hi dear, the thing is, your periods is not the way it should be, and that make it hard to find out if you are late or pregnant. I believe you are pregnant. But the best thing to do is to see a doctor. He can give you some fertility pills or just advise to get regular again.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|nETw4eOKaa	=]|`|1CryEnb3aa	May be too soon.  Hard to say for sure with your irregular period cycle.  I would say if still no AF, go get a blood test done to know for sure.  It can tell from the day of conception.  Good luck.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	wait till the 28th to test, since your cycle can be up to 32 days long. <br>  lots of baby dust!
aTPfjimeaa	Hi to my fellow Australian.<br>  <br>  I was in your position when I wanted to make my son's 1st Birthday Cake. After a lot of research on the internet etc. I had an image put onto rice paper at my local bakery and then had them put the image onto a decorated cake for me. It turned out great. There are some printed cake toppers on ebay, and I did purchase one to make my own cake but am glad that I had someone else do it as I could not remove the image without ripping it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
SSM3u4l4aa	I spent the last half hour looking for something to help you and I think I found something. <br>  It is a travel bed that folds up to about the size of a camp chair. <br>  <br>  You could take it with you or hang it onto the back of the stroller or wheelchair and if you need to go change a diaper you could go to the stall for disabled people. It should be just big enough and you could lay her down on the cot instead of struggling. Apparently the cot folds up and folds down easily and it is supposed to be pretty light too. <br>  <br>  I really hope I helped you and I feel so badly for you and your daughter. You seem so sweet. Keep up the hard work.|`|BJRdViTjaa	let me start with Im so sorry. Life sometimes isn't fair. But to answer your question. I have an 11 year old grand-daughter who was born with spinal bifita. And she has zero feeling of her lower body and no control over her bladder and bowels.  So her mom takes a light weight rolled mattress pad where ever they go.  Using a public bathroom can be challenging, especailly if it has more than one toilet.  So ask a worker to please, make sure no one enters into the bath room while you are cleaning up your daughter.|`|IDmaxViIaa	well thats sad and maby get a picnic rug and in a public toilet lay it down an dchange her nappy. I'm so so so sorry for your daughter!!!!!!!!|`|TlFnIei0aa	Take her back to the car and lay her on the backseat?|`|kYcBVmRMaa	go to a big department or a near libary or even a public toilet and even a shop and tell them the problem they will let you use the bathroom|`|976aa08aea43900b0d8216b1ef132c4baa	Try to find a wheelchair that has a collapsible back, if you need a "baby changing" type set-up. As was stated, use the larger stalls for disabled people.|`|AA11795652	Go to the large bathroom stall (especially for disabled people) where you'll both fit and then you can change her diaper there.

Now, she's sorry and doesn't know what to do.<br>  Don't be mad at her for breaking up with him. That's stupid. Help her while she needs it...<br>  Tell her what you think. Maybe it will change her mind. If you've been friends sience diapers, you should be able to tell her anything.

zpo0bXoTaa	well some options are: <br>  you could go to your local clinic and get on W.I.C or you could go to Metro Heath Department and get on food stamps. These 2 options could help you with food/groceries while on maternity leave.<br>  you could do work at a catalog call center (JC Penny's is a good one) and you don't even have to leave home. <br>  You could do Arbone, Mary Kay, or Avon. <br>  Online surveys|`|h1AIzD9baa	I sell Avon... Its easy and quick money!! <br>  <br>  You could do Mark.. Avon.. Mary Kay.. Or you could do candle parties.. My step mom does those.. Im not sure which company for tho.. she is also a sub teacher.. she loves her candle parties.. money on the side and free stuff!!|`|vygYFdsSaa	Paid surveys!!|`|62N5DC8qaa	Look into some kind of job that you can do at home on your computer and call convergeys maybe they have some work that you can do on your computer , i knew a lady who took phone call's on her computer for different company's .
Y8kjVeLyaa	Yes they do...I use my Avent with Dr Browns...and also with Asdas own brand bottles...just put in what you think is an ok amount of bottles..I took out the "shelf" things...there's noneed for them really. And no...don't bother with the 4oz bottles...I had loads and they went to waste as baby moved onto 6 ox bottles so fast.|`|5ZvALiclaa	Don't bother with the small bottles, there isn't any point and a waste of money. To be sure they fit, bring your steriliser to the store and try the doctor browns in it. I have a feeling the doctor browns will be too tall for the steriliser because the avent are the short fat bottles.|`|IDmaxViIaa	yes they fit.|`|YGSZgJuVaa	Yes dr browns fit no problem. I use dr browns and avent bottles in the avent steriliser. It doesnt matter which size  bottles you buy. Both small and large bottles fit ok.
pzLDXL6gaa	I doubt it. I've heard from most women going on the pill made them less keen on kids though that's probably just a coincidence. In your case it's probably just the fact you've gotten older, relationship more serious, and thought more about it. Have you had any experiences like somebody you know having a baby or spending time with babies? That could cause it too.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|AxiUWLtPaa	That is a good question. Honestly I would like to know too Because I already have a 2 month old son and I'm getting ready to get the implanon. Let alone I'm only 16 and really wouldn't want to think about having children anytime soon.
SSM3u4l4aa	Really, I can see what the harm would be if you were to get it and play it for her. <br>  Kids learn all the time.. every day all day long they are learning. The videos are supposed to be really fun and educational. If you were to buy the videos and play them for her she might really learn something. I don't know if it works but there is no harm in trying.<br>  I did a quick search at Ebay to see if they had any of the systems on there used and sure enough they do. <br>  There is no harm in trying- you never know.. it might work!! <br>  <br>  I will tell you this: had this come out earlier I would have bought it for my little girl and if I have another one I will get this program for him or her.|`|0SHOXqb4aa	I can't imagine anyone wanting to teach their baby to read.  Just let it be a baby.  Apart from anything else, it would be terribly bored when it went to school if it could already read like an adult.  And yes, of course reading is the key to learning, but that doesn't mean you have to be given the key as a baby.   Sorry for using "it".  I've just noticed you indicate your baby is a girl.  I would say no, don't start her on any programme.|`|P7q9cNaiaa	I'm not sure if it works but I'm interested to find out also! My fiance has a lot of reading problems, whereas I was always really good reader. I'd like to start off young to kind of give my baby a head start. (I'm still in my first trimester though! - maybe I should read to my belly!)|`|AA11349925	I think it's just another gimmick to get parents to part with their hard earned cash. They make it so you feel you're not giving your child the best start to make you buy this kind of stuff. You're doing great just reading to your kids, look at your son in advanced reading! he didn't need this programme because you gave him the head start with your dedicated reading, just keep doing what you're doing.|`|QTp6u4CPaa	I purchased it Saturday for my 13 month old daughter...am excited to see if it works!
vsFJZRkGaa	oh my dear, you are stressing out when you should be bursting with pride! your daughter is healthy, and thriving, what more could a mummy ask for?<br>  your ped will tell you that she is growing well and is a good size. <br>  you can not over feed an infant - they are much better then us adults at knowing what "full" feels like.|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	No you cannot overfeed an Exclusively Breastfed Baby. The ped will be very happy with all growth. They only worry when babies don't thrive or there is a massive change in their charts over a long period of time - not one month. <br>  <br>  Your baby's is destined by genetics<br>  <br>  Both my daughters were in the 95 percentile in height and only 50% in weight. They are now tall and healthy slim (despite mummy being a fat shorty)|`|IDmaxViIaa	no the doctor won't be mad at you its just growing it has to do that some time in its life i mean your baby might just be an early developer or something its ok chill and if you were over feeding it it would be wide not long!!!!!!!|`|h85kkDsbaa	Hi there, my son was born long and fitted into 0-3 month clothes straight away. he is nearly 7 months now and is still so long and tall i cant put him in dungarees because the legs are always to short for him, the shops need to do a tall section for babies lol.<br>  <br>  He always gos into the next size clothes a month early but purely because the length doesnt fit him anymore.|`|9Oy0dk7raa	yes|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Don't worry about it, every baby is different and grows at different rates.  My son's 4.5 months and wears 6-9 month clothing, he's also grown really quickly in his first few months.  It'll eventually even out so that she's not gaining as much each week.|`|jNErU39iaa	It has nothing to do with what you feed her as to how long your baby is. And as you said, she is also quite chubby so there is nothing physically wrong with her.<br>  <br>  My daughter is 6 months old, the 92nd percentile for length, and the 97th percentile for weight and she is perfectly healthy!<br>  Also just remember, just because a baby is big when they are little, it does not necessarily mean they will be big as children/adults.<br>  <br>  Good Luck =)
24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	go to the doctor!!!|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Being upset is the worst thing you can do. You need to relax the best you can. Even a nice warm tub of water but stop freaking out. That is never good for a pregnant lady.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	I would see a doctor just because they are more qualified to diagnose something than these yahoos. It may just be something you are eating. Cut back on dairy for a while.|`|A9gHfAZ0aa	cramping in 1st trimester is totally normal. I have had no spotting, but keep reading if you have cramping to call your Doctor.
n2O0NwR6aa	I don't know if feelings can be catagorized as right or wrong.  You can't help how you feel.  But I will say that it's probably not "normal."  My daughter is much prettier and more popular than I ever was, but I've never felt jealous of her at all.  I'm happy for her!  Her situation isn't taking anything away from me, so why would I be jealous?  <br>  <br>  That's what jealousy stems from, by the way.  The fear that someone else's good fortune is going to take something away from you.  It's normal to be jealous of your peers who may be prettier, smarter, richer, etc. - because they may take away our friends, lover, job, or rank in the social status.  But your daughter isn't competing with you for anything - she's not going to cause you to lose anything.  So its hard to understand why you'd be jealous.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	yeah lady thats SICK. If you loved your daughter you'd be soo happy she wasnt miserable like you growing up . You'd be proud of her|`|an1b4pXxaa	I feel like my kids achievements are my achievements after all they have my genes and I raised them to be the wonderful people that they are.<br>   So no I am never jealous of them.<br>  <br>  But I do feel jealous when my husband looks more pleased to see our chihuahua than he does me. Lol. I guess the green eyed monster strikes us all in unlikely ways|`|f3SyOyMEaa	It doesn't make you a horrible parent, but you play the hand that you're dealt. You should be proud that she is your daughter. Get over your past because that is what it is and be glad that you have a healthy, beautiful daughter. My daughter is smart and healthy and prettier than I ever was, and I couldn't be more proud of her and happy that she is mine.|`|qOzEuQofaa	Yes you are a horrible mother!! Why would you want your daughter to be a loner and never find love?! I would be proud that my daughter has friends/boyfriends. A good mother wants the best for their kids not the same sad life they went through. I hope you change your mind and be happy for your daughter!|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Sorry, i think this is the teen.... fishing for compliments. IF this is she, please, do something to raise your self esteem.... I don't think you have a lot of friends.....|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	Your feelings are your feelings and sometimes we dont have much control over how we feel; however what we do have control over is if we act on those feelings. Mistreating your daughter because of this jealousy would be unacceptable. Try to get to the root of why you feel this way and work on healing that part of yourself and letting it go. Work on your self esteem. I look at my daughters hips and say to myself that i would love to be built like that but in no way am i jealous of her, i appreciate her beauty. So take pride in the fact that your daughter has friends and that people find her attractive, after all she came from you so she had to get some of that from her mother :-)|`|b6EyFLgUaa	No your not a horrible mother, I know how you feel in a way. I think you need to do something for you, go to the spa and see how beautiful you really are. If anything be so thankful that your daughter didnt have the hard life that you ( and I) had. I was teased and tormented for years. I had friends but they were bad and so were the few boyfriends I did have. Look at your daughter and be proud you raised a beautiful, confident young women. Its not wrong, women are jealousy of the young girls they see alot of the time. We wish we had our youth and the carefree time of our youth back, sadly we cant. Be proud of who you are and what you have accomplished in your life.|`|RZWiU7Jcaa	No you're not a horrible mother unless you lash out at her for it. Just be happy about  her and put that side of you *Your past* to rest. You need to work on making a better you and letting the past go and moving forward and away from the person you used to be.|`|60FCA8dVaa	My mother was/is jealous of me. Never could understand it. I'm not jealous of my teen daughter. I just don't get it at all. There's absolutely no reason for it.
nBe13Qguaa	That's horrible. Maybe she is just trying to seek attention. Maybe she feels she isn't getting enough from you. I'm sorry, I hope it's just a phase.|`|vYgJMybeaa	Show her pictures of people where you can see their bones in concentration camps. Tell her about Anne Frank. Make her read the diary of Anne Frank. Make her read Night. Ask her WHY these people deserve to die. Ask her WHY she hates Jews and other "inferior" beings.|`|bTMdpMW9aa	That's pretty scary. Sit down with her and ask her why she wants to be a Nazi and what she finds fascinating about it. Whatever she tells you, react with that. Show her pictures of the Holocaust and read her things from history about the Nazi's. Let her know how horrible it is and how badly they treated people including the Jews. And if someone says horrible things about her religon and/or race, tell her that they're ignorant and to not let someone make her feel ashamed. Also talk to her about Hitler and let her know how much of an *** he was.<br>  <br>  I kinda know in a strange way where she's coming from because I'm half black and half white and in school, people would make me feel ashamed for being half white so I disclaimed the race. Then at my school now I get crap for being half black so I just kinda learned that I was going to get crap no matter what so that's the lesson you need to teach her. That she shouldn't be ashamed for who she is because some assholes give her a hard time because honestly, it's their job to give you a hard time.<br>  <br>  Overall just sit down and talk to her and give her some pride about her heritage. I think the true problem is just that she doesn't have pride about herself and she choose something horrible to be.|`|y96eYj0Faa	Hopefully this is just a phase and it will pass. I think that she might have had some bad past experiences about her religion and being teased. She is probably hurt and embarrassed and she feels like the only way to get over it is to act like she doesn't care and like she actually hates her religion. I'm sure once this phase passes, she will calm down. Maybe a good talk with a counselor or if this 'obsession' gets worse, maybe transfer her to a new school. Maybe a private Jewish school. There will be no discrimination there.|`|VlTyziH7aa	Maybe she's feeling like she needs more attention from you. Maybe it's peer pressure from her classmates. Maybe she's met someone that thinks Nazis are cool and are trying to be like them. It could also be that her peers are making her feel ashamed of her heritage. <br>  <br>  Try talking to her and telling her that everyone should be proud of their culture. And remind her of how violent and unjust the nazis were.|`|4CawfRxdaa	It could be her trying to get attention... also kids these days seem to not want to be the same religion as their parents... they want to be different from others. I'd say since you're Jewish try and get an interview with someone who survived the holocaust. It might not be easy to find someone but try and show her that killing people is not ok and show to her how lucky she is that she wasn't born in that time... if she isn't a blond haired blue eyed person she'd be dead. (no offense)|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You need to drill sense in to your daughters head by forcing her to, listen to read about the Nazi atrocities.|`|iTi26ojQaa	Have her read some books about the Holocaust, like The Diary of Anne Frank, Daniel's Story, Number The Stars, etc.

cJQL64ylaa	As long as it is done legally and the genetic parents and the adoptive parents are given full counselling then I don't see any wrongs with it.  <br>  <br>  On one hand there are many parents who have IVF and are lucky enough to have some embryos remaining after they have completed their family really don't want those embryos to be allowed to perish.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand there are potential parents going through absolute devastation because they cannot produce viable embryos who are able to give a wonderful future to these children.  <br>  <br>  Why should they not be allowed to match up and solve both problems, both of which can cause huge heartbreak to the people involved?<br>  <br>  And for the people who will probably respond and say that infertile people should adopt children and not embryos, the adoption process here in the UK is sometimes horrendous.  It works fantastically well for some people, but if you are unlucky with your social worker / local authority (as many people are!) it can be an impossible process, so please don't make judgements on things that you have no personal experience of.<br>  <br>  Nic x
JAdNkzENaa	i think 6-7 days is a really long time. if he is on formula i would def consider changing it. if you are breast feeding then i think you ought to talk to his doctor.<br>  <br>  edit: so the last time he had a bm was 6-7 days ago?|`|6Swq0iEPaa	That is not good. If his excrement is stuck in his rectum for too long, it could poison him. Go to or at least contact your child's doctor on giving him a suppository.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	The formula has probably made him constipated. Its normal for breastfeed babies to go 2 weeks without a poo, but not normal for formula feed babies.|`|h85kkDsbaa	when my son was just on formula he would go up to about 5 days sometimes without pooping and i was really worried. i went to the doctors and was told that not everyone (adults and babies) poop every day, and as long as hes not in pain or straining then its fine. However since starting him on solids, he is now nearly 7 months he poops more then once a day. I give my son fruit and veg about 4 times a day and water to drink with his meals and i really think this has helped him. When he was little my health visitor told me to give him 2ozs of cooled boiled water with a teaspoon of fresh orange juice not concentrated and this did help him alittle. It may be worth seeing your doctor anyway. Good luck X<br>  <br>  Also i switched to Aptimal formula which is easier to digest|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	Kaitlin has the right idea - but I'd say, don't wait for the doctor, give him the suppository now (make sure it is infant size!).|`|kWEr4Cvuaa	Please go see your GP immediately. This is no problem for normal people to solve.|`|gPb0s9Ulaa	If he's breastfed, then it is normal.  He's too young to be on solids, that could be part of the problem.   Both the AAP and the WHO suggest waiting until AT LEAST six months before solids are started.<br>  If he's in pain, or seems to be bothered by this, then you can give him some prune juice (some Dr.'s will even suggest a little corn syrup, I would talk to your Dr. about doses though).<br>  If he's not bothered by it, then I wouldn't worry about it.|`|VN2wmHnZaa	Have you been feeding him formula? some babies have reactions to formula which causes constipation. I'd recommend changing the brand of formula he's being fed and, with the ok from a doctor, putting him on laxitives for a while.|`|BJRdViTjaa	Well if he isn't fussy, or crying in pain, this just may be normal for him.But honestly asking people on line about your baby's health.......<br>  Perhaps you should address your concerns and fears with your babys pediatricain.
oDgnXJB8aa	If a potty chair with a tray will help you mom Go for it! You could search on the internet places like Walmart, Kmart or sears. or a childrens store.<br>  But if this child is girl, I can tell you a story about my little grand daughter, She was two , still in diapers. My daughter let her come to my house for the weekend. I went to the store and bought her some really cute underwear. And ever so often, I would say to her, "You need to peepee? I would tell her don't peepee in your pretty panties. and believe it or not she never wore another diaper. She use the adult tolet. of cours memaw had to help her.<br>  Now the boys, I use to get a cup and hold it to their wewe and take warm water and pour over their wewe, when they peepee, I would cheer for them.<br>  Again this is an old fashion way of doing it, but it could help you. <br>  You could get the child a potty chair, and go to the restroom and the both of you sit, and just chat, maybe play with a toy, but rest assure when that child does something in the potty chair, you really need to cheer your heart out for them. <br>  I hope something here that I have said will put a idea in your head for the problem.<br>  Good luck|`|f5c09b69a5a31dbeccf525fc43e106e9aa	I've never ever seen one like that. It may seem like a good idea but I dint really think it is. You should make potty training a happy experience for your child. I'm assuming that your child doesn't like to sit on the potty since you're trying to lock him/her down. If you try something like offering incentives for going in the potty the child will be more likely to go....If you force the child to sit there he/she will equate going potty with a bad experience and will most likely wet their pants, wet the bed etc...anything to keep from having to go on the potty. Pick a weekend for potty training where you can devote the whole weekend to your child. No diapers should be worn at all and no pull ups either. Put the child in underwear and make sure he/she knows they're expected to go potty in the potty chair...There will be plenty of accidents so have plenty of changes of clothes available and if he pees on the floor then let him get a towel and clean it up himself then sit him on the potty.....That's what has always worked for me, by the end of the weekend your child is most likely not going to be fully potty trained, but the general idea will be there and it's a good start...If by the end of the weekend a foundation has not been set and you have made zero progress then your child is simply not ready and you should wait a few weeks...|`|AA11447866	I have never seen one with a tray, but you can give your kids a book to read while on the potty. Or some other toy. You don't need the tray. <br>  <br>  Before I potty trained, I kept the potty out in the living room. It was new and novel and a toy. Eventually, she learned what it was and what it was for. |`|nOq74I7Taa	That's not a good idea.  I just put a portable potty in the living room and let her get up and down when she likes.  And the last 3 weeks she has been doing GREAT!! She's also 2 1/2 you don't want to start your kid too soon, it could set you back on potty training.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	that isnt potty training... thats forcing a child to sit on the pot untill eventually the pee or poop and isnt teaching them the concept of using the toilet...<br>  |`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	They don't make them anymore. You might be able to find one at a garage sale or online (like craigslist or e-bay) but they don't retail anywhere anymore. 
FBJdJOe3aa	Could be decidual bleeding...you can email me. Check my answer in your lastest question (in the end).|`|h85kkDsbaa	Its really hard to say, if it was bright red fresh blood then it was probably a light period, but if it was brown and not fresh then it could have possibly been implantation bleeding. As you have said wait a few days and then take another test as the first test could have been to early. Good luck X|`|3p0QBNpwaa	The same thing happend to me, in dec I had a light brown/pinkish discharge(that I mistook as a period) I took a pregnancy test a month later when I missed my next period and it was positive. I thought I was due in sept but a u/s shown I was a month ahead and due in august.<br>  It's possible that its just and odd period or it's too early to show up on a test. Wait a few days and test again!
iIVnndPzaa	sweety i had the same thing.. and YES implantation bleedinig can be either dark red or light brown... there is no specific color to it... the flow of it is what you go by... if it wasn't a flow like your period.. it was most likely implantation... I just had the same thing 3 days ago and my period is due today and it's not here yet... Baby dust to you and if you test positive Congrats|`|7gLX624Gaa	I would hate to be giving false hope here but I don't think that it was a period. Normally a period has red blood and if your normally 4-5 days 2 days of really light flow is unusual. I would just wait it out if I were you for a few more days and then test again. My fingers are crossed for you.<br>  If this is not your month don't be discouraged just enjoy practising and 1 day you will get that baby.
PDypjXXWaa	As a rule, yes... And not only names. In Russian language every thing has its grammatical gender. Masculine, feminine or neuter. All words that name things of feminine gender, as a rule, end with A. Of course, there are exceptions.|`|AA10349481	Natasha is a male's name also in Russia.

I9tlJgRmaa	I'm not going to lie, I wasn't at all excited either. It took me a while, and honestly it took me a while to actually connect with my daughter when she got here. <br>  <br>  But twins is going to be alot to handle, and there's going to be alot of stress, and lack of sleep for you guys. And I think that once those two get here, you'll just be happy. Sometimes it takes some people awhile, and sometimes some people just are excited as soon as they get pregnant. <br>  <br>  I don't think there is anything wrong with you though, times are tough, so it's going to be tough. It'll be worth it though, trust me. <br>  <br>  =]|`|3gToWPZdaa	Because of your miscarriages, you might subconsciously be stopping yourself from getting excited. One loss is hard enough, but you've been through three. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't feel terrible, but I understand. I'd feel the same way. It'll get better. You may not get excited, but once your babies are in your arms and healthy, I think you'll feel better. Best of luck!|`|vygYFdsSaa	Don't feel bad. It probably is a combination of hormones and the fact that you've been let down three times in the past. Not getting too excited is your way of guarding yourself from being disappointed again. I'm sure when the time comes you'll be ridiculously excited. Congratulations on the twins!!|`|xeS8pUfbaa	maybe it will come when they are born, are you stressed out?
reO9Dgmsaa	If you got one positive and then negatives, and are bleeding, that sounds like a miscarriage, most likely such an early one it's called a chemical pregnancy.<br>  I'm so sorry!  :(<br>  *praying for you*|`|BJRdViTjaa	Not if you started your birth control pills back up as usual.  But it sounds like you need to be seen by a ob/gyn doc to make sure there is nothing wrong with you.|`|0SHOXqb4aa	Well, false positives are very rare with pregnancy tests, so unless it was a very faint result, which appeared some time after the test was done (in which case false lines can appear), then it looks as if you were pregnant and miscarried.  That would explain the prolonged bleeding.  Although 4 days early, it's possible that this month you ovulated a week earlier than normal.  However it is very unlikely that you would become pregnant on the pill, so it is a bit of a puzzle.  <br>  <br>  No, I don't think the pill's effectiveness will be disturbed by your bleeding, so keep taking it for now, but see a doctor.  I don't think there is anything badly wrong - we all get hormonal upheaval from time to time, but you should have serious conditions ruled out.  <br>  <br>  There is always the possibility that you have entered the perimenopause, that time in a woman's life where things start to go haywire as the body starts to wind down its reproductive system.   You don't say what age you are, but premature menopause is not uncommon.  Perhaps if you want to have another baby, you should see a doctor soon and get on with trying, just in case.  But I'm only guessing.  Good luck.|`|SSM3u4l4aa	Darlin' you might need to call your doctor tomorrow and see what he or she thinks about it. There are so many things that could cause bleeding like that- some of them small and some of them serious. I am not trying to scare you or anything- just being honest. Talk to your Dr and see what they think.|`|IDmaxViIaa	maby call your doctor.|`|PSGJZLUbaa	could you be having a miscarriage?   If you rule that out I personally would suggest you see your doctor ASAP.<br>  <br>  PS the pill isn't 100% perfect.|`|kYcBVmRMaa	ignore that girl up there she is so stupid it could be nufink but go to the doctors and ask to see the nurse she will tell you but try not to worry every think should be ok im shore it will im 2 scared 2 go doctors about my problem i aint been on my period 4 6 months now thts not normal and im a healthy eater
vygYFdsSaa	I think I answered this question but its not showing up??? I think you should wear it now. Your experiencing minor pain and it would make bf happy. Its so cute that he wants you to wear it, you're lucky he's so concerned.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	wear it now! what would be the harm?<br>  <br>  i have a normal seat belt and have never even heard of a pregnancy one lol but it sounds like a good idea, if you have it why not use it?
hIzQyflqaa	I dont work and i have 1 child and another on the way but my husband provides for us so we dont claim anything from the government! But i wouldnt say to someone that they should abort a baby just because they cannot afford that baby, that is what would have to happen in order to make having children illegal!|`|sVrkjixAaa	Hypocrisy with empathy is better than the absence of both.|`|9DKNSq9daa	I agree with you.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	I think you are right on a lot of levels. but, what are we going to do? besides keep paying for it
SrCV4UtSaa	Depending on what your normal ovulation cycle is and considering you just had a period about 2 1/2 weeks ago you would only be a week pregnant at most so an ectopic wouldn't cause you any discomfort this early. A home pregnancy test probably wouldn't give you verification this early either.  My guess would be that your discomfort is something completely different. If the pain is disrupting your life then I would definitely go to the hospital. If its bearable then I would make an appointment with my regular doctor as soon as possible.|`|18PnBZaEaa	to me sounds like you are pregnant. and these pains are the normal pains everyone gets when your body and ligaments are stretching to adjust for baby coming i still get them and im 5 months. if really painful go to doctor.. but sounds like exactly what i get a dull ache and very tender i got leg cramps up until 12 weeks. doesnt sound like ectopic pregnancy sounds normal .. DO A TEST TAKE IT FROM THERE. good luck xx|`|VT0YGdK2aa	Take a pregnancy test then Go to your gyno.  You dont need a hospital bill to tell you that you are pregnant.  And your Dr. can diagnose the problem usually in office.
AA11296427	Nope, not really. <br>  <br>  <br>  :]<br>  <br>  EDIT: Wow, OK, thumbs down. Jealous much?|`|r39EDGhPaa	Not so much anymore.<br>  My mom used to freak over nothing, and hit my sister and I.  It got really bad so eventually my sister moved in with my dad, and she made my mom promise to stop her bullshit or she wouldn't come home.  Ever since my sister came home, my mom has calmed down a lot.|`|z3Oed98laa	yes...i dont think there is anyone out there who has the perfect "american" family where everyone is always sun shiny and happy. I have quite a few family problems but we make it through because we love eachother|`|qs1NMpXQaa	yeah we do...we just hide them very well from other people. We dont want everyone knowing things...you know what i mean? People put on a act ( to seem they look perfect ). Once you step in a persons home; you realize their real lives. My parents are divorced ( they have a good relationship still because of me ) but my dad lives with another woman...and we hate each other. Fight constantly! She hates my mom so of course im on my moms side and so is my dad because he always agrees with me. Serious problems with me and my dads girlfriend. Dont worry- no one is perfect...they just put on a good act!|`|4GCH1lTyaa	nope..been divorced for over 20 years...i live hundreds of miles from my relatives..although when we were all together i did have a pretty good life and no probs with my sisters or brother..my relatives were all pretty cool people|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Yes ,but I will never try to type them all because I could write a book series.|`|TfLPRwFWaa	no..|`|XzksQ3AFaa	I used to when I lived at home. I was raised in a single-parent household and my mom had alcohol issues. She also had an abusive boyfriend for a period of time, which affected my relationships with men for a long time before I was able to put it past me (some days I still wonder if I'm letting it creep into my life). I think everyone has problems, it just depends on the severity of them. Some problems are little, some aren't. Also, how families deal with those problems really affects their impact on the family itself. A family that ignores the problem will be hurt more by it than one that faces it.|`|ejelObdJaa	i sure do... unfortunately every family does.|`|T8G0wOXQaa	Yes all the time.|`|8VotkEXHaa	yuppers :)|`|0xiHNsmVaa	No.|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	impossible...i dont have a home|`|z6OqBkBGaa	yes i do|`|vQuoI4VJaa	When I was a kid a had VERY BAD family problems. My dad left me and my twin when we were very little, and my mother left us pretty much to our neighbor. When our neighbor died we were thirteen and pretty much had to raise ourselves from there. We only saw our mom when she came home at like midnight to have sex with her boyfriend on the couch.  I got married at 18 and my twin at 19. We had to get married to support ourselves.  A LOT of people have family problems, you just probably haven't met any of those people because you are rich.|`|2K1cf4PPaa	in an area such as yours, most people would seem like the happy family because they have the money to put on the perfect front.

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? If my child got home late, by 5 hours, they wouldn't be allowed to go out for at least the next 2 months. They'd know I meant Business when it came time to a curfew. I would remove phone and internet privileges, and I'd not allow them out anywhere after school. They'd have to earn back their trust. <br>  <br>  Regarding shoplifting, I would again not allow them out anywhere, unless I found some kind of volunteer work for them as a punishment. ?¤·?|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	2 weeks for stealing..coming home late ..a week|`|PTdy6TWRaa	It would depend on the age of the child and what rules and warnings were made clear in advance and what other discipline methods or groundings had been tried up to that point. The reason for their lateness would factor in to it too.<br>  <br>  I think a natural consequence to coming home late would be to put stricter limits on the times they can go out and new stricter deadlines for coming back in for the next couple months.<br>  <br>  For shoplifting, if its a very minor first offense, I'd think of making it a rule that they can't go shopping without adult supervision for a few months.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	it will be harder for you one day to enforce a punishment for your teenager<br>  <br>  loosing the trust with a parent , for the parent is heartbreaking<br>  <br>  accept your parent or parents choice here, I know a teenager that has no parents and would enjoy waking up to a punishment and parents who care|`|TDGhHIvNaa	It would depend on the severity of the transgression.

My other sis on the other hand was always getting into trouble. She had zero common sense. My mom tried everything with her. Nothing worked. She was actually my step sister, and my step dad wanted to be the only one to discipline her. He took away her tv privileges, but allowed her to go out with friends. He was an idiot. She is now a 16 year old slut, who drinks, does drug, passes pictures of herself half naked out online. <br>  <br>  My advice, is to first sit with the child and explain why its wrong what they did and how it made you feel. The second time, removed the source of the problem. If her friends are getting her into trouble, removed phone and INTERNET privileges, and no after school fun. ?¤·?|`|rNvXWMOMaa	no electronics for 1 week|`|J38v75bvaa	it depends on what they like. my 11year old nephew is a video game freak...when he gets grounded all the games go. my 15 year old nephew gets his skate board taken away and has 2 stay inside...my 8year old niece loves 2 read so she gets all of her books taken away.<br>  <br>  and the reasons very on the age. 8year old gets grounded for talking back alot and just having a bad attitude the 11year old gets grounded for talking back, not doing his chores, and calling his "girlfriends" too late. 15year old gets grounded for everything lol calling his friends past 10, not being in before curfew, back talking, cussing, bad grades<br>  <br>  the older you get the more rules you have so the more reason you can get in trouble. <br>  <br>  really it just depends on the age and what they did and also how often they do it. <br>  <br>  when i was young, we didn't get grounded. we got spanked up until we were 16 and then they took away EVERYTHING.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	I was grounded by:<br>  -No having friends over<br>  -No going to friends' homes<br>  -No television<br>  -No movies<br>  -No music<br>  -No after-school activities<br>  -No phone<br>  -No PC<br>  -No video games<br>  And at one point, the door was taken off of my bedroom. <br>  <br>  And honestly, I am glad that my parents did all of that. It kept me from growing up into a spoiled brat.|`|6d08a4180b9ee9bdf1db85f96aaeed92aa	I was never grounded, but never misbehaved that much because I was taught right from wrong, and was sat down and talked to everytime something was wrong.|`|SimAO1IUaa	i was never grounded my parents said i couldnt go out but never stuck with it|`|fb3c4ac134f006739c90e4bdaad1da0baa	When I got grounded I had to sit in my room, on my bed, unless I was doing chores, eating, or at school, etc.  No phone, radio, or toys, but I could read in bed.  Bedtime was usually early unless I had homework left to do.  Chores usually were the most menial kind, like scrubbing the bathroom, scything the weeds in the back lot in the hottest part of summer (a truly backbreaking and sweaty job).|`|F8sqyRAhaa	everytime my parents grounded me i would sneak out my window i never stuck to the grounding . . . . however when they started to take away my fave things like my mobile or stereo then i started behaving as i couldnt stand going without my mobile for 2weeks . . so i would suggest you do this rather than grounding your child as it doesnt really work especially when the parents find it hard to stick to the punishment as well|`|ewM1dLW3aa	children - always always enforce discipline if what they are doing is dangerous and partially enforce other things so they know they can still come to you for help<br>  and teens....are difficult <br>  my advice as a teen I would say pick your battles for example its not worth grounding over cleaning their room try grounding on morally wrong things like fighting or if its important to you bad grades unless you can see they are trying also the main reason teens like me act up is because we somewhat think we are smarter than our parents dont ask why<br>  lastly the biggest and best tactic to controlling teenagers is to give them a little freedom so they feel like they have it even though you have them under control I.e let them go watch a movie with friends but you drop them off, wait and examine their friends and pick them up this way you can give them freedom and also feel secure|`|A6iJGksUaa	Depends what they did. But when i was smaller and even now my parents took away the following:<br>  <br>  *The best clothes I loved leaving the icky ones i never wear.<br>  *Cell phone<br>  *computer privliges (only used for hw)<br>  *No Tv<br>  *No candy or junk food<br>  *No Ipod<br>  *No GOOD books to read|`|WeZvJb78aa	when i would get grounded, i would sneak out at night and get twice as ****** up cuz my parents though i was just asleep all night and not suspicoius at all. its ur childhood, live it up man
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? It is not cruel in the slightest way. Like I've said before, they need to know there will always be a consequence, that they can't get away with something just because its the summer or their birthday or so on. They should of thought before they acted. They need to know they can't get away with anything.<br>  <br>  It depends on what the child did for what their punishment would be. One of my first things would probably be to remove the tv. You seem to really go on about removing a tv to be a cruel punishment, yet you bring up obesity. If the kid is going to sit around all day, I'd prefer them reading then watching tv. ?¤·?|`|sS1jlF2naa	It's kinda cruel, and grounding children does nothing but make them more rebellious.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	Why is there a need to ground them. If they did something wrong, they have to take the consequences. Else they will just do it again, or even something worse. <br>  How to ground them? That would depend on what was done. How old they are and on there personality. If you have a child that is not big on watching TV. It won't be any thing if he/she cant watch TV etc etc.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	There is always a point. Grounding is also difficult on the parents. I had a friend who stole a bike. He got grounded for 3 months mostly summer. The folks wanted him to spend more time around the house and to find new friends. It worked, its been 30 years and he hasn't stolen another bike|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Something tells me your parents grounded you.<br>  And if you were mine.. you'd be grounded from the computer too.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	It's not cruel if they deserved it.|`|wE7lLCHSaa	Summer vacation is the only free time?  What about weekends?  Holidays?  Winter vacation?  Spring vacation?<br>  <br>  I should back up: what did the kid do?  If it was pretty bad, then I'd say he/she earned a serious punishment. <br>  <br>  The parent should work hard to find an effective punishment.  Yes, it's hard work.  No, it's not fun.  Yes, the parent has to be the bad guy sometimes.  <br>  <br>  Who cares if it's cruel anyway?  The parent isn't there to be nice and friendly all the time.  The parent is there to try to help the kid grow up to be a decent and respectable person.<br>  <br>  And what is all this about childhood obesity and fresh air?  Geez, when my parents' generation was young they just got beaten.  American kids today are so pampered and feel so entitled to everything.  What kind of people are they going to grow up to be?|`|XYT7jvBdaa	No, it's not. So what if it's the only 'freedom' they have during the school years? If they do something that goes against their parents' rules, then they deserve to be punished. And grounding can be very effective. As a kid I actually had everything but my books taken away from me at one point, and it was quite effective and looking back on it now, I am glad my parents did it. I respect them for it. <br>  <br>  Who cares if the kid LOVES television? Being grounded from it could teach them to become more physically active, pick up a book, or do their freaking homework and study more. Restricting access to the TV can be a great thing for procrastinating kids and those who are overly dependent on the TV for entertainment. I don't see how keeping a kid in the house all day can lead to obesity. It's not as if they're being chained into a room with no physical activity and nothing but food.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Im not not going to punish my child because its summer. If my child does something wrong he or she will be punished. Its not an excuse that its summer. While my daughter isnt old enough or even in school I do know I was grounded in the summer just like I was during the school year.|`|OfTeSqoTaa	yes it is, in many ways because for one they have worked hard all school year and second this is there time to be doing stuff|`|eya1WDS4aa	If what they did was that bad then no its not cruel. they should have thought about what they where doing and what would happen if they got busted before doing it.

GrnIjiMiaa	Okay, I'm going to try my very best to keep my sarcasm to a minimum here...(crossing my fingers that I can pull it off)<br>  <br>  Of course there's a chance that you can be pregnant. Anytime a man ejaculates inside you, his little fish can swim upstream and fertilize an egg and *poof* a child is conceived. I developed pregnancy symptoms within 7 days of conception, so the physical effects can begin at any time. The only way that you will know is to take a test. You can do either a home test or go to the doctor, but you need to find out for certain.<br>  <br>  If by some stroke of luck you are not pregnant, I would highly recommend investing in some condoms and a good sex education book<br>  <br>  Good luck to you|`|AA11820380	I only had sex 2 days in sept., that was the day of ovulation and the day after and now I'm  pregnant. My boobs started to get sore when I was 5 weeks and i got morning sickness at 6 weeks, I'm now 8 weeks and boobs still hurt very much. i'm taking medication for the morning sickness because mine is severe. there is a huge chance that you could be. even if you take a urine test and it comes out negative it could be wrong so take a blood test if that happens, GL. |`|AA10015577	You very well could be.  The best way to solve that would be to take a test or go to the doctors.|`|RBMHWJHXaa	take a pregnancy test so you could know for sure|`|ad1IyCZ7aa	Any time you have sex without some kind of birth control then you have a chance of getting pregnant. There really is no totally safe time of the month. There is a strong possibility that you are pregnant. Can you buy a simple pregnancy test kit from a pharmacy where you live? They're pretty accurate, and you might as well find out for sure one way or the other.<br>  If you don't want to get pregnant then you must use a proven form of contraceptive - condoms, the pill, IUD, diaphragm - any of these. If your boyfriend doesn't like using a condom then he's showing that he doesn't respect you or care about what happens to you. I'd question the relationship - maybe he's just using you?|`|UDENYO4raa	I had horrible heartburn when I was in the first few months of pregnancy and I can honestly say, that that was a key factor to me...<br>  <br>  It's a hiiiigh possibility you are pregnant.... Try taking the "First Response" test... Those worked best for me and determined my pregnancy at about 4 weeks, and you'd be about that time.|`|rBNANXzNaa	SURE YOU HAVE QHUGE POSSIBLITY OF BEING PREGNATE....AND I JUST WATCHED A SHOW ON TLC THAT WAS ABOUT WOMEN WHO DIDNT EVEN KNOW THEY WERE PREEGNAT UNTIL THE DOCTERS TOLD THEM THEY WERE IN LABOUR, LOL...|`|0sI33S9Kaa	Well, it only takes one sperm to fertilize the egg. So you probably are. Go to a doctor for further comments. |`|AA11112201	You are pregnant, go get a test and that will tell you!|`|BfRT9s2oaa	i think yes u r pregnant . but make sure take a test.|`|a0cb768a2bcdc7a915356d5a5db75704aa	You won't have any signs until later on like 2 or 3 months.  Just get a test and stop worrying. And tell him to pull out!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	TAKE A TEST
OrKpKxkHaa	I think the "memorial celebration fundraiser" idea is great. Maybe you could print something out from the march of dimes website just letting people know what they are about so they get the idea. I birthday party is not really common for a child who has passed so I think you should make it more of a fundraiser and memorial thing instead of a birthday party (with cake, presents and a pony? that doesnt really make sense) I am very sorry for your loss and commend you for doing something to raise awareness! Good luck!|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	Send an invititation describing what your wanting|`|oXIYHsDaaa	explain in the invite that you are having a memorial celebration fundraiser.
6hb04Ow0aa	Well the two of you need to compromise. Riley IS a nice name, but the name should stay with your cats. Your daughter should have her own name I think.<br>  What about Ryan, Hayley, Ashley, Leah, Annaliese, Annaliesa, Liesel, Evelisa, Lisa, Elisa, Ainsley, or Avery? They're kind of similar.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	Gee, any kid would love to know they are named after the same as a cat...<br>  <br>  I think it's a bit weird.  It's not the only name out there, surely you can find something else you like.  Regardless, the name you choose should be something both you and your husband are happy with, not just you.|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	Riley is a VERY trendy name right now and it is so over-used that it's actually become quite funny.<br>  <br>  It would be really odd to name your baby after two past cats and I can understand why your fiance has an aversion to it.|`|R5dMLVlIaa	tell him that you really love the name and if he lets you have the choice of the first name, he can pick the middle name.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Riley is a masculine BOYS name. Awful for a little girl.|`|P7q9cNaiaa	I love the name Riley, but I do think it's a bit odd to name your first child after two of your past cats.|`|RKLFYS2Naa	RILEY is definitely a boys' name!!! Don't name your little GIRL a boys' name ..that's just embarrassing!!|`|fPJTZwoUaa	m aybe ur baby is the reincarnatin of ur cats and i think its ok to name a abay after a cat or dog  Rover tiger blackey  fluffy patch are great names and i think ppl should experiment more with names|`|50zbKv0jaa	why a male name like Reilly for a girl?<br>  <br>  yeah i can see his point he doesn't want a kid named after a kid<br>  if its a boy will you call it spot? or rover?|`|nUdbTUtHaa	Its weird I guess, but its not like you're naming them that after your pets as in because it was your pets name, but....you're naming it because its your favorite name....<br>  <br>  but it is a bit odd, if it ever comes up in conversation.  If you really cant agree come up with a compromise (Kiley) or your second favorite name, w/e that may be.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	You are going to have to come up with a new name. It is strange calling two separate cats the same name, but totally ridiculous to even suggest you use the same name for your future child.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	Ha my husbands the same<br>  <br>  ive had <br>  Sacha<br>  Owen<br>  Charlie<br>  <br>  as oets so he ruled these names out<br>  <br>  EVEN though his mum named him after a Thunderbird Scott!|`|eKDYbe9Laa	cats name should be some deference
sbfm5rCAaa	Your mucus plug is usually blood tinged so you would know if it was that. Slight increase in discharge is perfectly normal although make sure you are not leaking fluid.<br>  <br>  If the discharge is millky white and slightly thick in consistance then you are ok. If hte discharge is clear and watery then it may be a membrane leak. If there is blood in the discharge then you could be losing your mucus plug.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pvH3oHRfaa	I found that mine increased slightly towards the end yes. <br>  <br>  You'll know if you lose your mucus plug; it's like a huge blob of pinky/yellow snot!

I couldn't eat in the morning, but at recess (I was still in school) I could eat again, and boy did I eat! Haha.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	I never had morning sickness. But I did have lots of tears. Emotionally I was drained from second trimester.|`|sgMno1PRaa	I wasnt actualy sick once - but I could hardly eat because it all made me feel sick and especially the smells of food put me off before it even got in my mouth!!|`|AA10217725	its sickness throughout the day, leave alone morning. i get nausea every time i eat, and all food smells as if it has gone bad. i am always exhausted and can sleep 24 hours.

E6obQSpraa	Ever since ovulation this month for me, I have been having cramps which is really unusual for me.  Im only 6dpo and have had them everyday so far. Havent a clue what they are, but as we all know, cramps can be a sign of pregnancy, so heres hoping for us all!! xxx|`|7q9DL0uAaa	I have something similar, called my gp and he told me to do a test, which was negative but I think its too early to test. I ovulated last monday which weirdly was the 2nd time that month, usually I am around day 14 but this time it was day 13 AND day 20! Well I had the EWCM to go by. Don't anyone dare say it can't happen twice, it can, as it was on a documentary and the woman in question had triplets! After we did the bd on Monday nite, I had severe pains in my right side just above the pubic line and they are still there now, nowhere near so bad but niggling. It also hurt deep inside when we bd (doggie style TMI!!), I don't know if I am pregnant gonna wait til Wed/Thurs which is when I am due on.  I so hope I am been ttc for just over a year and getting very frustrated. Good luck to all us ttc!!|`|JjBwydymaa	oo hunni.. I was due to ovulate on sat aswell (but i never tested on OPK this month) but Im having the same kind of niggly pains this morning.<br>  <br>  But its far too early to have any symptom of pregnancy because its takes 6-12 days for implantation to take place.... but you never know hun.<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|cQq9vTTraa	the pains may be due to pregnancy.wait for few days and have a test.
ng7zWxwAaa	besides weight gain I loved being pregnant. what a gift from God to make life. It is truly a miracle. I loved the ultrasounds the heart beat the butterflies the kicks. the cravings the nesting the SHOPPING. and then you go through the worst pain you will ever feel and then the doc. hands you the most perfect gift you will ever receive your child|`|R5dMLVlIaa	yes and no.<br>  <br>  mostly, i do not like being pregnant because it is just so uncomfortable.  I can't sleep.  Can't eat or drink certain things.  And I do not like my hormonal mood swings.  I have been very depressed and also very elated during my pregnancy.  The ups and downs are driving me insane!  Also, I have gained 30 pounds.  I am always short of breath and things that were easy to do are no longer an easy task.<br>  <br>  On the flip side... people are very generous to you.  They are more willing to hold doors open for you or pick something up for you etc..  It is extremely wonderful to feel your baby moving around and knowing its something that you and your husband created.  Also, it is a blessing to be pregnant.  My husband has been an absolute charm for me during the pregnancy.  I like the extra TLC he gives me.  :-)<br>  <br>  So, I have a little bit of a positive and negative take on it.|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	No not really. Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that I'm going to have a baby and be a mother, but I don't enjoy being pregnant. <br>  <br>  I just don't feel like myself at all!!<br>  <br>  I love feeling my baby move and hearing his heartbeat but 9 months is just too long for me... I'm excited to not be pregnant anymore..hopefully only 1 more week :)|`|TlA2z5XJaa	I like the specialness of it but dislike the tiredness and crankiness, doesn't help when looking after other children or trying to study. Being pregnant is definitely a better feeling than that first week after the baby is born. That week is horrible!|`|AA10217725	yes i love being pregnant. as of now it is as if there's a deep bonding, i can  feel my baby breathing with every breath i take.but i guess its going to get only better, when i'll grow huge and wl feel the baby within at all times.|`|lm2j8g4oaa	yep love it : hope for the future, less pain, feel and look better than ever. on neg side am knackered, worry that all will be ok, little niggles though....all the best|`|8ELfnTODaa	I'm actually not too fond of pregnancy. Lots of people you don't know trying to force their opinion on you, strangers feeling like it's ok to touch your belly without asking, and of course all the physical strain. And also the fact that i'm extremely paranoid and always think there's something wrong so almost the entire pregnancy i'm a wreck because i'm worried something's happened to my baby.  But pregnancy is what it takes to make the loves of my life, so i'd never change a single uncomfortable moment for my beautiful children. :D|`|jKMH27gKaa	I feel very lucky to be pregnant; the only real side effect I have is I get tired very easily and if I lie down to "rest" I can end up taking a 3-hour nap. Also some light cramping/discomfort. But this is a very small price to pay for the reward. What I like: lol, my husband has to change the litterbox, which is a big perk, ha. I feel less guilty about not doing chores, which is dangerous. And the biggest perk is knowing there's a child (I feel like there's two!) inside me that we can't wait to see! :)|`|MWGSIoCgaa	Personally, I wanna say I don't like it much because I had a horrible first trimester; morning sickness day and night. But I have to admit I love being pregnant for the kicks, ultrasounds, and heartbeat. I feel even more attached. It's just a really special feeling. And plus not ALL women get an opportunity to carry a fetus. So I must say, I'm blessed! I'm enjoying this pregnancy the best I can.|`|sbfm5rCAaa	I love it.<br>  <br>  My hair is shiny, my nails are growing, I get a lot of attention even from strangers and I love feeling my baby move around inside of me. I love sorting out the baby's room and I look forward to having this beautiful person in my life forever!<br>  <br>  What I don't like is the moodiness and emotional roller-coaster that you feel and the discomfort when trying to sleep.<br>  <br>  however I know that in a few weeks that will all be over!|`|OiFNZnwOaa	i loved it both times and im looking forward to it again...it is the best feeling in the world when the baby moves and you watch your belly grow knowing there is a lil person in there that you are nurturing..|`|K6rZmVmAaa	Not really! lol. I miss having a going for a drink with a friend if I'm stressed (I'm not an alcoholic) <br>  <br>  I love it though when you can start to feel baby moving properly and I get lots of attention off family, like I'm ill, lol

f4zg7LHLaa	well i live in Northern Ireland, and i definitely think the death penalty should be brought back. i am also of the belief that they should have done to them, what they inflicted on others. maybe some people would think twice before committing murder.... criminals get off too lightly now days. look at Ian Huntley, murdered 2 schoolgirls, and is livin' it up behind bars. kept away from other prisoners IN CASE THEY ATTACK HIM!!! tvs in his cell, 3 meals a day, wow, some punishment. i would have handed him over to the girls parents. or let the other inmates at him.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Last movie I rented actually! lol, just returned it yesterday. (HIGHLY recommend for anyone that hasn't seen it, it is very good!)<br>  <br>  I have mixed feelings on the death penalty. There is so much corruption these days, that for the FEW that are innocent and die for a crime they didn't commit (which has been in the news very recently), that makes me sick to my stomach.<br>  <br>  If it were not for that, I'd be 100% for it. Get rid of the trash, save the money. bottom line.<br>  <br>  BUT, there are people that are completely innocent, that have died for a crime they had no part in. I don't know what to do with that part of things....is it worth it? Maybe. But how would you feel if it was your relative being killed for something they never did? That's what screws with my head on that subject.|`|145RUNQHaa	the law is too lenient with child killers and abusers though it's not often they are given a acharge of murder and they get out too soon if anyone is involved in a childs death they should be throwing away the key.but some cases are so shocking then if the evidence is strong and if it's a choice between releasing them or the death penalty i know what i'd choose.anything but risk letting a child killer back out to possibly do the same again.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Jail time and dealth penalty. <br>  <br>  People are not afraid to go to prison. <br>  Its like they get free tattoos, free health care, they can smoke, they still can have sex, free room and board and the can watch tv, they have a gym as well or atleast weights and crap and there are basketball hoops. <br>  <br>  Its like Club Med for the screwed up. <br>  Or Canada Gone Wild (I say that because of the free healthcare.)<br>  <br>  If people knew they get killed for serious offenses, they'd be less likely to do those crimes. <br>  This means that a small percent would still kill, like the mentally insane who were "told" to do it by the voices taking refuge in their heads.|`|AA11735666	Oh god yes!  I think that if someone kills, or rapes, Hell Yes!  Excuse my language but this question really caught my eye because I'm a big believer in "An Eye For An Eye".  If someone can do something that horrible, than they do not deserve to be living because they will probably do it again.  So, if we can't stop them by keeping them locked up for a while, then, yes, I do think they deserve nothing less than to die.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I am in favor of the death penalty. I think it should be used as rarely as we would hope abortion would be used. I don't know how to determine those sentences....|`|ghz5D5iLaa	There are quite a few things people do that they deserve to be put to death for. I am for the death penalty.|`|2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	I guess you are not from the US.  But it is a good idea to look at the death penalty system in action here before you make up your mind. Mostly because of the rising number of death row exonerees, Americans have been asking about the system itself and we are finding surprising and disturbing things.  Sources below.<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states, regions and otherwise similar nations that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  <br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  And, for statements of victims’ families:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org <br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Personally i think anybody who hurts children should be fixed and treated like an animal because thats all they are. Im sure my view isnt popular and legally it wouldn't be allowed but i think its sick how many rights people in jail have. Women who kill there children are given great health care, free college, treatment ect ect but at the end of the day it cant be changed they killed a defenseless child and nothing they can say or do can change that. In the 20 years it takes them to get out they get a whole new life, they baby the murdered gets nothing.<br>  <br>  EDIT- I have a friend who was murdered in a way. She was slipped a date rape drug, started to walk home and collapsed and ended up drowning in a a puddle. Do I think the guy who did this if ever caught should be put to death, yes because he was planning on raping her if not anything worse some one who plans that out cant be fixed. I was raped and abused as a child, was I murdered no but I would still love to see the people who harmed be behind bars and treated the way he treated me. An eye for an eye in the most extreme way. Do i think its sad that yes people are falsely convicted of course but the percent is small and with new technology getting smaller. Some prisoners  who have been in jail for a long time don't want to leave. Why would they if they show good behavior they get privileges like a naughty child getting off grounding. I think people who are commit a violent or sexual act are the scum of the earth. I have two sex offenders in my family and I will not see them or allow my daughter to see them.|`|oQaNYZxRaa	well I am pro-death penalty because there are things that just can be forgiven or to be served in jail for a few years. Now that said I live in a state where we have death penalty and most of the people who are in death row die of age, natural causes or killed in prison than as a result of whatever the choice is for death penalty. Is it worth it? it would if the penalty actually was carried out.|`|dU4IPBO0aa	No, the death penalty should not be brought back.  What right do we have to do the same thing to one person that they did to another and then tell them that its wrong?|`|HD4dxrFEaa	Death penalty! saves the country 54 dollars a day to take care of each prisoner.|`|MIJo5LkMaa	Yes, bring back the death penalty. Maybe it will help us in SA.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	when we as a society engage in a systematic process of killing people it cheapens all of us.<br>  <br>  to the person who says it saves money ... it doesn't.  with all the legal proceedings involved, it's actually extremely expensive to implement the death penalty.<br>  <br>  there's no evidence it's a deterrent.  the fact is, people who commit murder and so on don't think they'll be caught, so they don't worry about the penalty.  if they really thought they'd be caught, they'd be plenty deterred by life in prison.<br>  <br>  and there's plenty of evidence that we've put people to death who later turned out to be innocent.  want that on our conscience as a nation?<br>  <br>  leave the justice to God.  put wrongdoers in prison so they can't harm anyone else.  no need to turn us all into a mob.  we're better than that.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	if the death penalty deterred murder<br>  there would be no death row|`|nqcnylFpaa	i strongly support the death penalty but we need to carry out the sentience a week after the judge tells them they are going to die not 10 years like up here in washington in december of 2007 a daughter and her boyfriend murdered her father.mother,brother,SIL,and 4 year old nephew and 6 year old niece the people who killed them admitted to it i wanted to them to kill them myself they don't deserve to live the family didn't so why should they|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I really have no clue.<br>  <br>  On one end, it would save money for tax payers and such.Also, rotting in jail is much easier than dying.<br>  <br>  On the other end, I don't believe in hell and I really don't want them having the luxury of being in certain places...well I cannot really explain that here.lol.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·?

BWUlksmmaa	I honestly didn't think it would happen for me.  Not that I had been trying too hard but...I had quite a few (what I thought were) near misses in the past and never ended up pregnant, eg. I'd miss my pill for 3 days and think I was surely pregnant, but I wasn't.  Then I skipped my period a couple of times but still wasn't pregnant...all those negative tests made me think it would never happen.  But 2 months into really trying (actually having sex around ovulation time) and I fell pregnant.  I just didn't think it would happen for me and I had been reading all sorts of things such as what to do if you aren't ovulating, what to do if you have PCOS etc.  Now of course I'm worried it won't stick but I am crossing everything that it will be a healthy and safe pregnancy.  Good luck, research...knowledge is power.|`|h85kkDsbaa	Yes i felt this way, i thought it would never happen to me i dont know why but i couldn't help feeling that way.<br>  <br>  When me and my husband were trying we just stayed really relaxed about it and said if it happens it happens, we just carried on having a normal sex life not worrying about dates and then 6 months later i found out i ws 5 weeks pregnant and it was the best feeling ever, but then the stress of being pregnant started instead lol<br>  <br>  Try not to get worked up about it, it will happen for you but i am a firm believer that it will happen when you are ready and not stressing about it.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Oh yes I thought I wouldn't get pregnant for the first two years of marriage. I wanted to have babies right away but it didn't seem to be happening for us.  Well, when I finally got pregnant the first time and had a nice big girl I couldn't stop having babies. I had six children in 9 years and had to have my tubes ties to stop. We couldn't afford to feed any more than six.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	Yes. I was afraid of all of those things. It turned out though, that as soon as I relaxed and stopped worrying about it, it happened. That fear didn't last long. Then when I got pregnant, I was afraid that something would go wrong, and then that I wouldn't be a good mom, and then that they wouldn't be good kids. Our fears cycle themselves according to what is going on at that moment, but they don't do us any good, because they don't give us any control over what is going to happen whether we fear it or not. We may as well just let go of our fears, because they stop us more than they help us.

84a3f58bab9b254359c6da5c7fb80c7caa	Anything has a risk, abortions performed later have greater risks however at times there are medical reasons that make this a "better" option than not terminating. Also another thing to consider is the procedure is more painful the later it goes, the emotional implications greater, and the recovery time a bit longer.<br>  <br>  It's one of those things that I would not suggest unless there was a very compelling reason to do so. Also- finding a clinic or doc willing to do it that late can sometimes be difficult- and it gets considerably more expensive.<br>  <br>  Hope this is just a curiosity and not something you're truly having to consider.  Not an easy choice either way.<br>  <br>  P.S. Often the reason a woman chooses to terminate at 6 months is not because she doesn't want a baby but for medical reasons.  A friend of mine had to do this to her baby, painfully so, because he had a rare but serious birth defect that was not correctable and he would have died anyway so it was a risk/benefit consideration for the mother more than baby. The baby simply wasn't viable- but she still went through emotional hell so it's not a decision to ever make lightly.|`|USPabsDIaa	Well in the UK, you can have an abortion on the NHS up to 18 weeks gestation.<br>  <br>  However, there is places you can go and get an abortion up til 25 weeks.

A baby is a life long commitment.  Plus you think about the cost of formula (unless you breast feed), clothing, shelter and protection, not to forget love.  From the moment you conceive, it is no longer all about you.  But about the life that you will bring into this world. And when he/she arrives, it is time to grow up mentally. <br>  One last bit of advice, make sure that your child will have a mommy and a daddy. Do not cheat the child out of a stable home. Also if you wait until you can afford a child you will never have a child.|`|0SHOXqb4aa	I remember feeling the same way as you when trying for our first child, who's now 14 years old.  When I got pregnant I would have been scared witless and the only thing that stopped this from happening was that the nausea was so bad that it blocked everything else out.  <br>  <br>  I think we all feel this way and the only ones who don't are either lying or simply lack imagination.  <br>  <br>  My children have given me joy of the sort that I could never have imagined, even in my wildest dreams.  The decision to have them was the best I have ever made. <br>  <br>  Just make sure you are with the right partner first.  Good luck.|`|IDmaxViIaa	yes i had that with my first two kids but i've now got five and the othere three went well.|`|IGcS9K62aa	Its expected. It shows you're taking the decision seriously because it is one of the biggest you'll make. <br>  <br>   Its a great experience if you have everything squared away. If you can provide a stable and caring home. If you have the resources to feed, clothe, and provide a reasonable quality of life. And most of all... if you have enough love and time to give to a child then go for it. The world needs more responsible parents!|`|EFc8VGwRaa	of course it is because you dont know what to expect everybody gets nervous and scared and excited about having a baby|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Of course its normal to be scared its scary because its unknown. I guess it depends what your scared of, if your scared because your life will change then perhaps you arnt ready for a change. If your just scared of the labour, if you will be a good mum etc then thats very normal. But also too you have to make sure you want a baby for the right reasons, not just because you think they are cute or it will be fun. They are time consuming and it can be hard alot of the time. Good luck, you know when its time, it just feels right|`|JNvUskw1aa	Here's what I went through, I wanted a baby so I decided to talk to my boyfriend who I have been living with for 2 and a half years. Now I done the thinking by myself and I knew right there it would change our life's and would even be the best thing for us. I took a note book and wrote down Good and Bad I put down all the good things that would happen if me and Joe had a child and all the bad. Turns out there was more good then bad. Cause we have a good home, make enough money, and we would be able to give it the care it needs. Yes, it is normal to feel scared about the whole thing. When i lived with Joe for 1 year I was so scared that I didn't want a child, but, I started thinking after 2 and a half years. I thought Joe would make a GREAT father and I would make a great mother and I kept thinking of all the things I could do if I had a child, Things like raise her/him in church, teach him/her about God, make sure him/her would be a really good child. I want to have a child from Joe so bad. I started weeks ago and I don't know if I am pregnant yet or not. But, after all the thinking I did I finally made up my mind I WANT A BABY! And I know God is gonna bless me with one, I can feel it. So yes I feel a little scared but I try to remember all the good that one child will do for me and Joe and you should think of all the good it will do for you and how it will change your life. And sometimes it will change your life for the good.|`|j2VDYbeoaa	Can you provide for a child and not be a burden to society? Do you have a partner who will help with daily care? You did not say how old you are. Think about why you are scared, and go from there.|`|B5MDTdtPaa	of course its normal - babies changes your entire life, make sure youve done everything you want to in life first becasue when a baby comes theyre your life then! seriously you have time for nothing and work your life around theres :) x
wKuQC4yTaa	i am 23 weeks and the same way, hence the same its 4 am here and I was laying in bed for 2 hours. its not that i cant get comfortable i just cant seem to fall asleep even if im exhausted and know its going to be a long day. insomnia is common in pregnancy. so your not alone. i know doctors can prescribe something for you to help you sleep. plus try to limit your fluid intake about 2 hours before you want to go to bed. not when you actually go to bed. that helps with lesstrips to the bathroom|`|BWUlksmmaa	Me too.  I think in early pregnancy (pre-bump) it is more of a psychological thing.  You are thinking about the baby and your body too much.  I haven't been able to sleep properly since I got my bfp...but then I've been thinking about it non-stop.  And in my sleep, I'm aware of how I am sleeping and whether it will hurt my boobs, or hurt my stomach (I get sharp pains in my abdomen if I move at a funny angle - think it is where the ligaments are stretching)...so I am always conscious of it.  Later on in pregnancy, you have a massive bump to worry about!|`|slzx5202aa	I'm afraid it only gets worse : (<br>  I am 35 weeks and it takes me about 4-5 hours to fall asleep at night, some nights i don't even sleep because i can't get comfy.<br>  It's frustrating but well worth it : )|`|1EKMsuXpaa	Maybe try a pregnancy pillow.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Ask your dr if you can take Tylenol PM every once in a while.  Good luck and hope you get some rest!  Congrats!!|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Try making a small tummy pillow, we used to call them. They fit under the bulge of our belly and really help us relax. You can put some soft music on that will help you relax.|`|FlFlyIUwaa	Awwh, and you are so eary on! I went through a few nights of sleeplessness around 20 weeks, but with pillows its better now! Good Luck and Congrats! Also, 2nd trimester the pee thing should be a lil better!|`|AA11795652	It's normal.  You're excited and hormonal at the same time.  It gets better then it gets worse and then better and then worse again.  In my 3rd trimester when I was desperate for sleep, my doctor okayed for me to take one Benadryl to help me sleep.  Good luck!|`|52U22fiAaa	OMG, me too!  I'm 26 weeks but am having the worst time sleeping.  Sorry to say, I only think it'll get worse as you get bigger.  I've barely slept the past week and I'm hating life right now - lol.  You are not alone!|`|4jeqIx6Paa	im 30 weeks and cant sleep either , i been like this for the past 2 months !
QnJvJ67uaa	That's a tough age gap to entertain lol.<br>  If you can stand the mess I would go for painting, a huge bit of paper/old wall paper etc on the floor and lots of hand and foot prints...the 6 yr old should be able to follow rules about not standing on the carpet in painty feet so you can look after the 18 month old...then get them to tear/ cut pics out of magazines to stick on the painting and make a giant pic. We did this at pur preschool group (ages 18mth to 5) and they all loved it :)<br>  Good luck x|`|IDmaxViIaa	card for there family member they like. Painting hand and foot prints swimming in the bath lol. Lola
m0a7Ox1maa	grats Daddy 2-3 weeks before period is peak fertility!!<br>  <br>  sex is the leading cause of pregnancy|`|AA11503426	Take a test. It is more reliable than asking a bunch of strangers you have never met on Yahoo Answers.|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	Tell her to take a pregnancy test and if it comes out negative, take another in about 2 weeks. Good luck!|`|a9btWYKRaa	Tell her to take a pregnancy test. She may be late due to worrying about being pregnant.|`|drDpM6opaa	she could be pregnant maybe she got pregnant before the 2-3 weeks tell her to do a test|`|AA10967880	i would take a home pregnacy test<br>  <br>  <br>  sounds like symptoms or she could just be late|`|XvaKmukeaa	Anxiety can make you feel ill, my girlfriend was late by 2 weeks once and she was very worried, never get in over your head. Take a pregnancy test and if it's negative don't wait 2 weeks, take another just in case and if it's still negative then wait another week. She might have a medical issue near that region, like urinal.
3gToWPZdaa	Sure, they could be signs. They could also be PMS. Or, and this one may sound crazy, she might be setting these things off mentally. Women can actually worry about pregnancy so much (or want to be so badly) that they will begin to manifest the early symptoms.<br>  <br>  If she's 5 days late, she could take a pregnancy test and it would tell her what she needs to know.|`|HM0cxcahaa	<a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsrXfrrAFrDmJS8RIyUZGDOlERV.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222235917AA0yOpV">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|vygYFdsSaa	Being 5 days late is a definite sign. She could just be sick which would account for the other symptoms. Again, she needs to just take a test and get it over with, since she is late on her period the results will be accurate.|`|ylHrqNvkaa	thanks for answering mine!<br>  umm mines been just over a week and still nothing but we have taken 2 tests nd both negative so i dont kno lol<br>  get her to take a test.<br>  goodluck<br>  stress less|`|xwMWfuBTaa	tell her to TAKE A    T E S T<br>  It's very simple!<br>  <br>  Ovulation can be absent or delayed, particularly as she is so young.<br>  <br>  The only way to know is to take a test.|`|egXXgFAyaa	stfu noob|`|bJfcuKZWaa	well..considering that you guys had the unprotected sex 2-3 weeks ago..the best bet is to wait maybe a couple weeks..5 days late is a def. sign ... but also,fearing that u r pregnant..can actually make u get the symptoms and skip ur period..i had that problem....taking a test now could b too early bc of her HCG levels..hav her take 1 test and if it says negative..hav her take another one in a couple weeks..by then, the HCD levels (pregnancy hormone) should be high enough to detect a pregnancy...i had a pregnancy test say negative and a week l8er found out i was 5 weeks pregnant so yeha.lol.but good luck!|`|MAdFGBN8aa	There is no point worrying until you have taken a test. There are many things that could explain these symptoms, stress being one of them which will just get worse the longer you both don't know. I know it's scary but do a test or see a doctor.
54JkSGLiaa	to be sure, i'd say get a pregnancy test to be sure. she could just be moody, but she can also go to the local health department to get a pregnancy test done there, or go to the doctor for a blood test.
WA9Y8QAEaa	Sounds like she could be pregnant, just get a pregnancy test to make sure and if she's not, get the morning after pill. :)<br>  good luck!
I9tlJgRmaa	first off. <br>  <br>  She wouldn't have those symptoms that soon. <br>  <br>  If she's been worrying about it, then that can cause it to be late.
UC3ckMD9aa	Yes She can perform ultrasound to check the position of fetus. Its gestational age. Whether it is a ectopic pregnancy. She may be able to hear the heartbeat of your fetus.She done ultrasound to see the proper development of Fetus. As you are 11 week pregnant and you do not have 5th week checkup so the chances are great that she will do an ultrasound.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Some do, some don't.  It just depends on the practice.  Just give them a quick call and they will tell you!|`|u94HOVz7aa	some do some don't.  mine did to determine exactly how far along i was, and to make sure how many there were (twins run rampant through mine and my hubby's family)       ; )|`|kwMuRDFjaa	I got mine on my first visit and I was 9 weeks. Most OB's do.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Probably not. the wont do one until you are about 20 weeks.|`|ZxJw85hfaa	well if its your first visit I would think so.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Its possible, Mine did and our baby looked like a cute little gummi-bear... So adorable!|`|O7U1tUaJaa	most of them do to make sure that you are as far along as you think.  I should have been 10 weeks along at my first visit.  she did an ultrasound to confirm and turns out I was only 5 weeks.  I just skipped a period for no reason never happened before but for some reason it did then.|`|G766dQjtaa	Some do and some dont. Mine did not do an ultrasound until i was 20 weeks. Call them and ask them so you know.|`|eHTbY6lhaa	depends on the doctor, but i would say that they will. i am 22 weeks preg with my third child and all my doctors did things different. good luck and congratulations
JebgVOA2aa	Call the cops anyways. Get a cam and record him or take pics.|`|EBEa4Q9vaa	theres 3 options. <br>  1....go and beat hiz *** and pull her out....<br>  2....DONT WORRY ABOUT IYT ND DONT GET INVOLVED B4 U GET URSELF INTO SOME SHYT....<br>  3....call police. dont matter if hes a police or not. but b4 u do record thayt shyt for evidence. but make sure u got GOOOOD evidence|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	It doesn't matter that he is a cop. They don't protect each other from this. Just call 911. When he is at work, go get her and take her to a shelter. Or call a shelter and ask them for advice.|`|eGPZpfr5aa	cops are not above the law so he would get arrested|`|XCWYYBJRaa	cops are people too,  chances are once his buddys find out wot he is all about they will have similar disgust for him as the rest of us do,  i was attacked by a woman a few months back for hitting her boyfriend because he hit her in the street in front of me so be carefull about getting involved with domestics,  but i know its hard to stand back and do nothing,  at the very least a call to social services because it isnt fair that a child should be born into a relationship like that,  a tough position to be in,  good luck|`|xrBeYQFTaa	i happen to know that cops like this really get whats coming when their superiors find out. the only advice i can give is to go into the police station and demand to speak to his superior.<br>  if that doesnt work, try and get video footage of the man beating the woman (i know it sounds horrible) then he WILL go to jail.<br>  idk if it were me i'd blackmail the sh*t outta him.|`|AA10967880	go higher than him. find a woman help organisation or domestic violence who can help in your endevours, or if your game and brave confront him. tell him you know whats goin on and your givin him the chance to stop before you report him.|`|F2rI3Juaaa	Do the right thing and call the police.|`|INQc9VS3aa	How sad.. just try to call the cops.|`|dGM6JGqdaa	If he works for the city police call in the sheriff if he works for the sheriff call in the state police, but before you do contact an agency that protects women from abuse that way they can stay on top of it to make sure it is handled properly !<br>  <br>  I wouldn't blackmail him but I would get some evidence on him abusing her, if you try and blackmail him he could alway's use that against anything you do to him !|`|m0a7Ox1maa	unless she wants to leave him there is not much that you can do<br>  <br>  call the police if they are arguing as they are causing a disturbance
QV5E70e6aa	No body can say that you are still virgin.Virgin means :<br>  <br>  The process of brokendown a hymen in side the vagina which result in to flow of  blood out side the vigina.Normally we believe that this will will occur on the fist intercourse.If you believe like this yes you are still virgin.<br>  <br>  But note that the hymen can be brokendown due to other reasons also such as cycling,gim acivity also.<br>  <br>  Yes, the sperm can pass to uterus and result in to pregnency  even with this hymen unbroken also,which is possible in your case. But chances are remote.|`|WQ1sjTPDaa	try to put his peni in vagina strongly|`|CI3Gbl34aa	you are still a virgin.<br>  and learn to spell.|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	u r still a virgin physically,but by having a boyfriend and all the foreplay u lost ur clean soul.<br>  <br>  do't worry, u r still a virgin.<br>  <br>  but careful there is a chance of getting pregnant.if u r not interested in full sex it is always safe not to remove ur underpants whatever the temptation.or use a condom and enjoy sex.u can remove all ur cloths but keep the underpants.wait and pray for ur next periods.<br>  <br>  ask him to lick ur vagina and u can masturbate him,then he will not be so aggressive.<br>  <br>  enjoy safe sex|`|880a7a37d20953bcd40786d42ebf7afaaa	hi there is no doubt that u r still virgin & there is no chance's getting for pregnant for this process. in further for physical sex play take prediction measure to avoid any kind of  risk|`|g9lWTCkGaa	yes you will but you will not enjoy
P7q9cNaiaa	That upsets me, I'm considering applying for government assistance, but when people abuse it, it gives hard working people like myself a bad name. Government assistance is made to help you help yourself, not to live off of. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, if your sister is stubborn enough to move out before she was ready, and feels like government assistance will provide for her everything that she needs, she's probably going to go ahead and have a baby anyways. <br>  <br>  Some people don't want to go to college right away, and that's okay, but I strongly suggest going to college if you want kids. I'm going to nursing school right now, and I'll be a mom while I'm going which is going to be tough, but you that's part of being a young mom.<br>  <br>  I honestly don't know what to say about your sister. I strongly believe young parents can make it work, I've seen it happen, and I plan to make it happen for myself, my fiance, and our child.... But on the flip side, there are some incredibly irresponsible, and immature young parents, and there isn;t much we can do to stop this. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry I wasn't much help. :(|`|1tmX7xbRaa	no one can get through to kids these days. if there was a way there wouldn't be so many teen pregnancies or abortions. it's just sad that these jerks (no offense) are willing to hinder a child in such a way because of their own selfish reasons. it's sick really. some people should not be allowed to reproduce.|`|5ZvALiclaa	Send her to live with a family with a newborn for 2 weeks. she'll change her mind pretty darn quickly when she realises she hasn't showered for 3 days, can never go out unless she's armed with everything but the kitchen sink, hasn't slept in what feels like a million years and is up to her elbows in poop every 5 minutes...oh and she'll realise she doesn't have enough money to pay for all the baby stuff let alone stuff for herself. <br>  <br>  Or buy one of those robo-babies and make her parent it for a month.....<br>  <br>  or send her to me for a month, my house is pure choas...she'll change her mind quick sharp!<br>  <br>  if that doesn't work nothing will|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	I know she's your sister, but if you have any concerns for this baby she is having, you need to let the authorities know,

rhPCJfeuaa	At 3 months, his neck muscles are a bit stronger than a newborn baby's would be.  Cradle the baby in your arms with the baby's head resting in the crook of your arm by the inner elbow area.  this is the most comfortable for most babies and will allow you to sit comfortably as well.  Don't take this wrong, but practice on one of your old dolls until you feel more at ease and check with your mom to see if you are doing it right.  Once you feel relaxed, your nephew will also feel relaxed.|`|Yl93lP1laa	At 3 months he has a bit more control of his neck than a newborn.  Basically what you need to do is gently hold the back of the head near the neck to ensure that it is upright.  If his head is slumped to the side or forward his breathing can become impaired.|`|4WVUBnA6aa	Try not to “hold” him at all- cradle him in your arm (if you’re a righty, cradle him in your right arm). Just angle your arm and keep his head in the crook of your elbow, with your right forearm underneath him and your left hand free to adjust, give him a pacifier etc. You’ll get to tickle, play with him, look at him- you don’t need to “hold” him awkwardly for you o for him, he’ll be most comfortable and relaxed this way (and so will you).
pB1oXLz5aa	the age of 2 is a very incredible time in a child's development. she understands a lot more than you probably give her credit for. The best thing you did is prohibit her from seeing the baby in the casket. I saw an infant under similar circumstances when I was 9 or 10 and it screwed me up big time. your daughter is still piecing things together and she'll start asking questions. If I were you I'd just answer those questions honestly and and in an assuring manner. don't over think it, and don't try to address it before she's ready. this will buy you some time and prevent her from getting more information then she can process.|`|rEyXxDd4aa	I think it' s far too abstract to explain to a child of her age .  if I had to , I would start with the death of a pet animal , telling her that , in the end  , everyone goes to a final sleep to make room for newly  born creatures .|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	from what i've read, at two, she will not understand, you can try, but.... it just won't set in. Until she understands what it is to be alive, she will have no comprehension on what dead is. If she asks questions, answer them to the best of you ability. That is all I can advise.|`|7b3e55f1520292b18d56fea36b36fdccaa	In My Opinion you have already told your daughter to the best in her ability to understand. She will have to be alil older in order to understand it any better then she does now.|`|IGcS9K62aa	She probably won't understand but it is worth nothing. I think the bye bye thing is an effective method a the time for such a small child. <br>  <br>  When she sees her aunt she'll probably ask if you are religious put it in that context. Like, "She went to heaven." Something simple. You don't want to frighten her. (So I would leave bye bye references alone, you don't need her freaking out when you go to leave sometime.. she's young, but anything is possible!!) She probably won't remember but you don't want to put something incorrect in her mind. <br>  <br>  If she goes anything beyond that, or when the topic of death finally comes up place it in a context that she'll understand. Everyone sees death, whether its family, pets, or even plants/flowers... there is always something to compare it to. <br>  <br>  Making it simple and short is much easier than ignoring her if she asks. Just don't give her the wrong idea, it could come back. You know what she is capable of understanding, some 2 year olds are impressively sharp. Give her the truth in the context that she can handle.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	My cousins saw my cousin when he died (their father) <br>  <br>  they were 2, 4 and 7.They saw him in the casket and knew that he was gone but that was their last chance to see him and say good bye.When my cousin (their mother) spoke to them, this is what she said: there is a place called "Heaven" and some people go bye bye there.Don't worry because we will all eventually go there and we will all see each other again.<br>  <br>  It really depend on the maturity level.Your daughter might not ask a lot of question or she might.Some kids get freaked out and start wondering if they or their parents are going to die and some are chill with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss.
TlFnIei0aa	Alot of them can be, some you need an amniotic fluid test which can be requested if you are concerned about something (eg. you and your partner have the CF gene and want your baby tested for CF), others such as blindness can't be detected til birth, and the rest such as cerabil paulsey and autism cant be detected til early childhood.|`|m0a7Ox1maa	depends on different factors - not all abnormalities are tested for - that would be impossible<br>  <br>  the main ones like down syndrome can be|`|ZgBdeZnvaa	most are by blood test or ultrasound at four months.

It really helps with the endless peeing, & bad cirvical pains. You should really ask your doctor about this injction. It will help you. This shot is unfealable.
RGn4ry2zaa	Failing to understand the child. Baby, grade-schooler or teen. The kid not trusting you, not feeling safe to tell you something.|`|JG5ujkCEaa	The common mistakes many people make are to drop your babies. Damn that sucks.|`|woCRQVgtaa	Forgetting that your baby is learning new things everyday.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Never yell or cuss around children<br>  Always set rules and schedules for children<br>  Always read and sing to them<br>  Allow the kids to be kids with manners.<br>  As they grow, teach them to make their bed<br>  Teach them to respect their parents<br>  Teach them to never, ever lie.|`|52U22fiAaa	my school of thought is this: Anything that I resent or don't appreciate that my parents did, or anything that my parents failed in raising me, I'm going to do the opposite.  <br>  <br>  You need to keep a close bond with your child, nothing better than that!|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	Not burping it and then wondering why it keeps spitting up on you. Their tummies are sensitive. Another is giving solid foods too early. Also giving up on breastfeeding too easily. Sometimes it's hard, but it is much better for them than formula, and has no risk of tampering. The biggest one though, is being nervous that you are doing it wrong.Tell the pediatrician the truth about everything, always. one of the biggest mistakes you can make as a parent is lying to the docs. They are on your side, and want what is best for the baby. Trust your instincts.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Don't buy too much baby things such as clothes and toys. They grow out of them too fast and a lot is wasted. Don't get upset if people give you advise about raising your child...listen and decide what to keep and what to ignore. Decide with your partner before the child grows up who and how you will raise the child. United you stand divided you fall. Do what you think is best for your child..nobody knows them like you do. Try to have a happy home. Nothing is better for a child than at least one happy parent...except two happy parents. But if you cant be happy don't stay together for the child. The child wont be happy either. Until they are about 5 and go to school don't buy them lavish gifts for Christmas etc. My daughter loved taking the paper off gifts more than the gifts themselves. Buy them many little things they will like to play with...a packet of balloons or a bubble blower will be more appreciated than any $300 ride on horse. Who are you trying to impress anyway? Keep their butts clean and their tummy full and kiss them and read to them and love them every day and you will have a happy contented baby. Try to let them have contact with your extended family...family is important if it is not too screwy. They don't need a lot of things but they need you and after a while you will find that you need them too.|`|AA11349925	Letting others make you feel guilty or that you're a bad parent<br>  Caring what other people think of your parenting<br>  Always seek help if you need it<br>  Share the load<br>  Communicate with your spouse/partner/bf/wife/gf<br>  Make time for yourself<br>  Enjoy your baby as much as possible because it goes too fast.<br>  Don't be afraid to make mistakes, mistakes make us better parents.|`|AA11795652	Realize that you're going to make mistakes and that doesn't make you a bad mom, just learn from your mistakes.

wKuQC4yTaa	start taking prenatal vitamins with at least 800mcg of Folic acid now.  if you can;t, some women use flinstone vitamins in stead. just make sure your compensating what you don't get out of the regular vitamine by eating it.  find an obgyn you want to go to and when you get a positive pregnancy test, call and set an appointment for 8 weeks from the first day of your last period. that will put you at 8 weeks pregnant which is normal for most OB's offices.|`|XTBlOf9baa	Uh... right... 18 and 20... doesn't seem like a great idea to try to conceive. Go to college, get an education, get good jobs so that you can fully support yourself, get married, etc. This isn't a good idea for your life plan. Anyway you really shouldn't be TTC when you clearly know very little about how your body works. Generally after birth control it takes months, even up to a year, for your body to start ovulating as normal again. It will either be irregular or non existent ovulation most likely. As for prenatals, anyone to is TTC should treat their body as if they were already pregnancy. No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes, and prenatal vitamins every day. Who cares if you have trouble swallowing them. It's not about you, it's about the baby. Crush them up into applesauce. As for doctors, if you get pregnant, see your general practitioner to take a blood test to confirm your pregnancy. After that, he can help refer you to an ob/gyn. If you really want to be responsible about this, then wait. End of story.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Please wait a couple more years to have a baby. With the way things are right now it would be smart to just start a savings account and make plans on where you will live after the baby arrives. You will need so much more room. Plan on all the furniture you will need, it is expensive. Make a list of clothing baby will need the first year and go find out how much diapers and formula cost.  Do your research first before you get pregnant and did you know if you have no insurance it will cost you over 6 thousand dollars for the Hospital and Doctor for your nine months.|`|bvLvOqIzaa	Wha eh zha

rOlY7sOBaa	chances are depending on where the cysts are she might not be able to have kids or may have a hard time having kids. another thing you might want to take in account is that sperm can last up to 3 days within the uterus so since it was 4 days ago you're ok but remember that condoms are only 92% effective and with spemicide it's only 98%. you should also talk to your doctor about the cyst with your partner if she's interested in having kids in the future. good luck.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	If she's about to ovulate, she can't really be pregnant. It's really hard to become pregnant when using spermicide condoms.

Really.<br>  <br>  However, the 3 most fertile days of a woman's cycle is the 3 days BEFORE she ovulates. Sperm can stay inside and alive up to 2 - 3 days.<br>  <br>  www.pregnancy.org<br>  www.fertilityfriend.com<br>  <br>  I'm sure you will be fine though.|`|3l9Dlidiaa	They say you can be you can still get preggo about 5 days before ovulation.  I highly doubt that she would though since you used condoms and she has cysts right now.  |`|k3hY3FMjaa	if you used condoms properly than no!|`|IsPlrwiRaa	u cant rush ovualtion|`|9bc1PUydaa	why are you worried about her being pregnant? I don't really understand your question. You used condoms so she's probably not pregnant....and she just went in for ultra sounds showing she has cysts. I wouldn't worry about it unless the condom broke.|`|6e2eebd498466699a4ceb47740f7b7cfaa	No, I would say not. It takes about 24 hours for any sperm to die inside once ejaculated, and by the time her egg surfaces, it will be long gone. You should have nothing to worry about. |`|UcF86tBOaa	Probably not, but it is always possible.  If you used spermicidal condoms, there shouldn't be any live sperm there anyway.|`|g5VBh9cfaa	If you used condom and spermicidal than she shouldn't get pregnant. It would be good to know if she is on birth control because that would help higher the chance of not getting pregnant.
FiUprYsvaa	I was you in high school. <br>  I knew everything even the teacher gossip. <br>  <br>  I was told everything and anything. <br>  And it is a big burden to bear, many people wouldn't think so but it is. <br>  <br>  Just blog about it, make fake names for everyone.

If they don't stop u will spill everthing.|`|4d8420be4f044c1627ede2b5585dd409aa	When they start telling you a secret, stop them and say "If this is something that you don't want anyone to know, keep it to yourself." If they ask why tell them you don't feel comfortable with all of these secrets. If they are talking $hit about each other to you, imagine what's being said about you behind your back! Didn't think of that one did you? Stop with the secrets and maybe you'll feel a little better.

AA10096832	I didn't know about the sign language instructor. Hmm.<br>  <br>  In any case, I got a book from the library and did sign with my daughter for many, many months. She never did a sign. Then, when she was 13 months old, she and I watched a Signing Time DVD that I got at the library. OMG. Baby daughter had a 60-sign vocabulary in a few months. For whatever reason she LOVED those DVDs. I only let her watch 15 minutes at a time every few days but they seemed to stick. She and I would watch them together and pause the DVD and do the signs. It was fun for both of us.<br>  <br>  If I had the money for an instructor to come in and teach my baby and I anything, I would think it was fun. I wouldn't require that the instructor be a mom. I'm not sure I understand that part of the question.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I started signing with my son before it became the normal thing to do, I looked into the instructor program but thought it was a bit of a rip off. I would never pay to go to a group when I could teach my child myself for free. (I did buy the book though so I guess not for free it cost my $20 for the book) There are lots of fre programs like parent child mother goose where signing is Incorporated and there's no cost.|`|Efa5EYJJaa	We sign to our son. If you don't know sign language yourself and want to hire an instructor then go for it. My husband and I both know sign language so we are going to teach our son. He is only 2 months old right now so I can't tell you how it is going yet lol. I teach a class in the spring for children and my husband teaches the adults. Kids love it. I have done research about baby sign language and I think it is neat that babies can communicate with you before they learn to talk. There are several who have had success that I have read about. I saw a video on youtube with a baby signing and it is great. I think it is good to know sign language and to teach your children. I like to sign, I am still learning. My husband is so much better at it than I am lol. It seems kind of overwhelming at first but you get the hang of it after awhile.
KvEcy40qaa	dont' listen to these people....chances are pretty slim...i received some advise from a professional doctor, not some average jane's on yahoo answers and he told me there are only a couple days in a woman's cycle they can get pregnant, and that 90% of semen dies in a woman because of the temperature...so chances of this girl being pregnant are slim to none|`|aD7kHTJNaa	umm yeah UNPROTECTED SEX = YOU COULD BE A DADDY!! buy condoms!|`|s1BaLV1Laa	Yea, and while you had unprotected sex, you could have had more pre - ***<br>  So the chances of pregnancy very good!<br>  <br>  Congrats!

kv8ZFPP1aa	ground her.take her stuff away.tell her she can't go out anywhere until she can be responsible.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Ground her.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	My daughter came home past her curfew a few months ago.  She was at her boyfriend's house (down the street) and she was specifically told to be home by midnight... yet she strolled in at quarter to one.  She gave me the old, "I lost track of time" B.S., but I told her that didn't cut it.  <br>  <br>  Her punishment was being grounded from seeing her boyfriend for 2 weeks.  Now, that may seem a little harsh, especially for a first offense.  And it was a pretty miserable 2 weeks.  But guess what?  She hasn't been a second late since!  Because she learned right off the bat that I was serious about this.  If I'd let her off the hook "this time", she would've been willing to take the gamble that I'd let her off again next time.  <br>  <br>  You need to decide on a punishment - something that will mean a lot to her - and then be sure to enforce it!  No "discussing" or "reasoning" with her.  If she's late, she faces the consequences.  Once she figures out that breaking curfew = misery, every single time, she'll probably start being a little more punctual.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	Don't allow her to go out for a while. (That worked with me, lol.)<br>  When you do let her start to hang out again, make the curfew earlier than before. Once she shows you that she can be responsible again, make the curfew later and later until it's at the original curfew.<br>  <br>  As for the lying about where she goes, get detailed information about what she will be doing when she leaves. Randomly show up and make sure she is there.|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	Let her know that since she is unable to stick with the rules of the house and be home by curfew that from now on you will be going with her when she goes out. And if you are unable to go, then she can't go.|`|pp9RzHvDaa	For every minute she was late, subtract those minutes from her curfew for the next time she goes out.  If she lies again, make her curfew something really embarrassing so she won't want to go anywhere.  That always worked on me.|`|2OoG0GNjaa	I use to do this to my mother mostly because I knew she wouldn't approve of where I was going even though I wasn't doing anything bad (my friends and I would be at the park talking until 3am). <br>  <br>  This situation varies from person to person. If you know your daughter and know she isn't the type to do bad things you can try CALMLY speaking to her about your worries. Even if she tries to brush you off tell her that you really are worried. Reason with her and don't assume the worst.<br>  If you have a teen on the wild side and reasoning doesn't work with her, tell her you will call the police if she stays out past curfew. This worked on my brother when he was wild. My mother called the police on him and he never was out past curfew again. <br>  <br>  Also, if she has a fone make sure to call her often or text her if she isn't being honest to you. Continue to do this until she learns to tell the truth. Once you are sure she is being honest then she will automatically text/call you when she is going somewhere and will tell you how late she will be.<br>  <br>  If reasoning doesn't work and she doesn't listen then you MUST go through with your "threats".

I like staying at home. Subtracting minutes does not work because i know she will not follow. Try this:<br>  <br>  If she have siblings and gets home late. Try going to a store like an ice cream store and buy her siblings an ice cream so she will be jealous. Then, tell her that you were waiting for her so you can treat her but she is late. This works the best if her siblings are girls too.|`|9t5zZYhlaa	a good slapping lol. No really just ground her for awhile and if it continues, make her curfew earlier until she learns to obey it and if that doesnt work, don't let her go out at nights anymore. eventually she'll learn to listen to you|`|WNn8WDPHaa	Ground her. if that doesn't work, try therapy could lead into worse stuff
xwMWfuBTaa	Implantation occurs 5-12 days after ovulation/conception.  Your period is due on day 14 - at 4 weeks pregnant.  At 5 weeks pregnant, yes you would know it if it's a miscarriage, your hCG is up in the 1000's and you continue to get a positive pregnancy test for several days at this point even after the bleeding has stopped.  <br>  <br>  As far as "products of conception", the whole sac and embryo is smaller than a raisin, but as your endometrium (womb lining) has begun to thicken your period may be slightly heavier or longer than normal.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	if you were pregnant you wouldnt feel the miscarriage that soon, it takes a few days sometimes even a week or two to pass the baby.|`|3427eebd84da66693a5d9d29a3fcc54caa	If you are miscarrying, 80% of the time your period will be heavier and more painful than normal.

pzLDXL6gaa	You have to make a choice, it's abortion or having a baby. There are no safe at-home things you can do to cause a miscarriage if that's what you are thinking.

sbfm5rCAaa	This is quite a difficult one to answer because it depends on the level of osteomyelitis. If you have it quite severe then it could be a real problem with carrying a child to full term but if it is minor then you would probably be fine with the help of support garments.<br>  <br>  You must definitely speak to a doctor about this though. I have a friend with spina bifida who had a baby (via C-section) a few months ago. the baby was prem at 7 months but other than that she was healthy so it is possible. She was on bed rest from 3 months pregnant onwards as well to stop any complications.<br>  <br>  Speak to a doctor about it but these days almost anything is possible.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

If you like it, go for it.  My main reason for commenting, though, is to offer encouragement about naming your son Ramiro after yourself.  My son is named after my husband, and my husband was named after his father.  All of my brothers-in-law have sons named after them.  It has never been a problem for anyone, and all the boys are proud of this family tradition.  So don't worry about what other people are saying.|`|aHLnNrOGaa	You are just asking people to misunderstand this name.<br>  <br>  He will always have to explain what his name is, 'No my middle name is Junior... I am not a junior... But my name is similar to my dad's...   My dad's name is....<br>  <br>  Please learn from my life experience.  My name is very similar to my dad's.  The middle name is the only thing that is different.  It has caused problems all my life.  I still get mail to junior, even though I am not.  (I am in my 40's).  It causes problems with banks, getting mail, insurance...<br>  <br>  If you love your child do not do that to him.  It is about him having a good name he can use in life.  It is not about you.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	I think you should go with Ramiro ___?___ Cuevas (junior).  If you give him a different middle name, he can go by that as well as Ramiro or Junior (Junior could be a good nickname, but might not be so good as an adult in some situations and it might be good to have another proper name in his full name that he can also go by and not be confused with you as Ramiro too).  That is just my opinion, anyway.   Good luck and congratulations.|`|HsL0PYNGaa	I would go for Ramiro Junior Cuevas.

5ZvALiclaa	If your workplace or job is unsafe then you have to tell them because it could be harmful for you or the baby so use your common sense there. If its not, then you aren't obliged to tell them until you see fit. I would do it before you start showing though as that is just curteous and its going to look bad if it looks like you tried to hide it. Since it will be under 12 months you will not be entitled to any paid leave but if you are a good worker with a good boss they may come to an agreement on taking you back after a certain amount of leave.<br>  However, they may give you the sack and use another reason, who knows? That is a risk you have to take, but its not like you can never tell them you are pregnant. Its going to become very obvious pretty soon. I had baby last july and i was showing by the february before so i would tell them and soon.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|m0a7Ox1maa	well you don't have to tell them your pregnant but waddling around the office at 8 months is a bit of a no brainer|`|mPLXUorTaa	Maternity leave depends on your workplace as well as the state you live in.  I don't know any specific laws in Wisconsin.  You'll need to talk to human resources or look it up on your own.  You should tell them about halfway into your pregnancy.  You'll probably end up taking a combination of short term disability, vacation, and sick leave, and personal days if the company has no set maternity or family leave.|`|h1AIzD9baa	id like to say they cant let you go... but thats just untrue.. i worked for my employer for ever a year.. and it was a small business..

XTBlOf9baa	Your doctor actually explained it very well. A hormonal pregnancy is when you get a positive pregnancy test result due to pregnancy hormones, but there is no implanted embryo or eventual fetus or baby. Your chances of having kids are most likely still good, but I really can't say for certain. I don't know your full medical history, so clearly you should ask your doctor about that. All I can say is that hormonal pregnancies are very common, and it usually does not indicate a larger problem with the body. It just means your body got confused, started preparing for a pregnancy, but the actual embryo was never there (implanted in your uterus). And, no, I don't think it's possible to have an ectopic pregnancy (tubal pregnancy). That is one of the first things they check for when the embryo isn't present in the uterus. Every doctor knows that. Think of it this way. If you leave your dog in one room, but later can't find your dog, your first instinct is to check the rest of the house. Your doctor would have checked for an ectopic pregnancy to make sure, because they can be very dangerous to you if not caught and terminated as early as possible. Anyway, your doctor explained it pretty fully. I really suggest that you talk to your doctor about this. It's always best to speak to your medical professional directly about these things, just because even though I'm a nurse I don't know your full medical history. All I can say is that usually this affects your ability to have kids in no way whatsoever. It's just a body goof. Sometimes our bodies mess up. Yours was getting ready for a guest that was never coming over. It's upsetting, disappointing, and heartbreaking, but it's just a biological mess up, just like most miscarriages are.
IDmaxViIaa	the baby will die you idiot gosh but if you eat pencials then i think the baby would rather be dead i mean when your kids in school they'll be like mum whats for tea well darling you would say where having nice pancials with led in the middle is that the yummiest dinner we've had so far and your child would say but we have that every night you have a problem get some help and put your baby up for adoption its better off then a pancial eating mother.|`|8ELfnTODaa	you trolls are just getting lazy<br>  <br>  and just so you know during pregnancy if you crave things like that (which does happen) it's considered a sign of anemia.|`|geYWzzM2aa	you have pica it is a disorder where people crave or eat inedible objects or substances largely unnutritious material <br>  talk to your physician about this they usually ask about this in the questionnaire you fill out on your first routine prenatal appointment some substances and objects can be harmful to your baby and your own digestive system you should definitely seek help for this disorder.|`|55Xq3a5Laa	you probably shouldn't be eating slate or graphite while you're pregnant.

I would say if she said a girl, and at 20 weeks, it would be safe to say your having a girl.  My sono tech told me at 16 weeks mine was a girl and she had only been wrong once in 14 yrs of scanning.  I felt like it was still early to tell for sure, but she was right.  It was a girl.  Good luck and congrats.<br>  You could always pick up other gender neutral colors like yellow, light green etc.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	most of them dont say they are 100% for legal reasons and all that, usually they would give either a 70% girl or something.. but yes to answer your question i dont think anyone says they are 100%|`|5ZvALiclaa	they always say 'not 100% certain' because they have to leave room for error in case you sue them for telling you the wrong sex. <br>  <br>  However, if she was really uncertain she would've said something like 'I'm 60% sure its a girl'.<br>  I would start buying the girl stuff and keep the receipts for returning stuff. Get another scan in a few weeks/month if you can, you may have to pay though, and it will either confirm the gender or tell you something different! Don't tell the next sonographer you were told it was a girl, wait and see what they say so they give you an unbiased answer on the gender.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|wxImZRssaa	They aren't allowed to say 100%. That's what my sonographer told me. I was told I was having a girl, and they got it right. However on occasion it can be wrong.<br>  <br>  We went on to have a 4d scan at 27 weeks, (you have to pay for that) when they confirmed I was having a girl, I was happy to buy girl things, lol. <br>  <br>  I was paranoid after a friend of my sisters was told she was having a girl, bought all girl stuff then had a boy!<br>  <br>  I'd recommend paying for the 4d scan, they are amazing. We now have a DVD and lots of photos of my girl in my womb.|`|26cnysY3aa	well if i was you i really wouldn't rush to much on going out and buying every thing pink. I know a girl who had a 3D scan and was told she was having a girl...and went out and got every thing pink...and guess what.........she had a boy!!!<br>  It does happen.....try and focus on buying things like nappies, bottles, things like that...remember shops arnt going to close as soon as you have baby, there is nothing wrong in buying things after the babies born!<br>  <br>  Good luck X|`|s1BaLV1Laa	Friend of mine went for 3D scan. Showed it was a boy. On her 36 week scan showed it was  boy. She gave birth to a lovely girl after making the entire room blue. <br>  This situation is rare, but I would say just wait till your next scan before you go all out with the pink stuff.
SJ9lOnCOaa	GOOD for you for being responsible at 15! <br>  <br>  This should be something she talks to her doctor about, but I would recommend doing some research online. I know people who have taken both and have not gotten pregnant, but every woman/girl is different so do some research and talk to the doc!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  Thumbs down for encouraging safe sex? Really now? obviously abstinence is not going to happen so why not encourage them to practice safe sex? <br>  <br>  I'd rather answer a question on <br>  "which type of birth control is best?" then "im 15 am i pregnant?"|`|EFc8VGwRaa	the implant because alot of women get pregnant on the depo|`|jD8TxlLfaa	Personally, I love the implant. <br>  It really depends on what your girlfriend prefers, though. It's possible to get pregnant on any form of birth control. Just remember that no matter how careful you are, if you have sex there is always a chance of pregnancy.|`|unq5llX6aa	While I think a LOT of you for thinking about birth control while being sexually active I do think you are too young to be having sex. For physical AND emotional reasons.  Studies have long proven there are many adverse effects for sex before the age of 18... That being said, the reason why people get pregnant on the pill is the effectiveness of the pill and not taking it right.  Pills several years ago were not as effective as they are now.  Not only that but combination birth control pills such as ortho-trycyclin, yaz, and yasmin are more effective at preventing pregnancy.  It is almost impossible to get pregnant (if you take it at the exact time every day and no antibiotics) because it prevents pregnancy three different ways: making cervical mucus hard for sperm to get through, preventing egg from being released, and making uterine tissue inhospitable.  Depo can cause you to gain weight and implant causes other unpleasant side effects.  I would suggest low hormone dose bcp.  Also girls should learn their body fertility.  Google ovulation calender and learn the days you are fertile additionally.  That way you can take birth control/ depo/ implant/ condom and know that you have to be EXTRA careful (or no sex at all) on those days.  Good luck and I commend you for using protection.|`|5ZvALiclaa	Abstinence is the best thing....BUT if you want to be mature & responsible then I would say get an IUD. It does not have the high levels of hormones that the implanon and depo do and in such young bodies you don't want to mess it up too much. It is also put in for 5 years where as the depo is a 3 monthly shot and the implanon is only 3-5 years and both are known to cause very bad side effects.<br>  <br>  IUD is a near perfect birth control method but you still need to use condoms to protect yourself against sexually transmitted diseases.!!!! Please Please Please still use condoms!!!|`|AA12147519	15 and birth control?!!!  This is what is wrong with society anymore.  It used to be frowned on and now it is apparently encouraged.  Morals are not being taught anymore except for whatever you "feel" is right.<br>  <br>  You said it yourself your 15 and legal age is 16.  Grow up first, then go talk to a doctor for professional advise and don't ask the question on here.|`|h1AIzD9baa	i respect you for taking responsibility.. and its just a fact that teens are having sex earlier now.. if they were only as smart about.. <br>  <br>  i was got on the depo when i was 14..and stayed on it until i was 19.. i had no complaints.. and i didn't tell my mom.. my older sister took me to the clinic.. she was a teen mom and didnt want me to make the same mistakes she had even tho i really wasn't sure what she was talking about .. i wasn't worried about sex at 14 but no more periods sounded wonderful to me .. i had horrible cramps..    but i am realy glad she did..|`|nETw4eOKaa	DEPO!<br>  The implant is so agravting!<br>  and it causes bad headaches.<br>  and you throw up alot!<br>  definatly depo
8iLVnYRUaa	I have got the Little Touch Leap Pad (which works with the Leapfrog Baby books for Infant and Toddlers), I bought it when my daughter was about 6 months and she is now 29 months old, so because she is familiar with it she now likes to play with it on her own but she still needs my help to put in the cartridges and place the book in the pad. I would say my daughter gets lots of enjoyment from it and usually has a go at the Leap pad every day. If your son is interested in normal books then I expect he will like the Leapfrog books, they have an age range on the packaging so just choose the right one for his age.|`|RLtzqQB9aa	my little brother has the leapfrog book thiing where you put the book you want in and you can play it. <br>  my brother has most of the leapfrog things but the book and the thing thats a bit like a playstationare definatly his favourite :)|`|ZIm5utPWaa	How old is your little one? I bought my daughter one when she was 2. It was a huge waste of money! I don't recommend it.
PTdy6TWRaa	Between now and September is a very long time in the life of a 3 year old so a lot may change by the time school starts for him. By then he might be able to handle the full days much better. For now it sounds like he really needs the daily nap but is somehow resisting the nap routine. Sometimes moving the nap time to an hour or so later than you've tried before can make the difference. Good luck.
EFc8VGwRaa	no!! it could just be that baby is positioned differently and just makes you look small and for some people babys sometime grow more towards the back then the front...which make them look tiny and ive known a few people who hardly look pregnant maybe 4-5 months when they are 9 and have given birth to healthy 7-8lb babys...|`|nhhCow4haa	No way! Everyone, including my dr thought i would have a baby that was between 6lb 8oz and 7lb 10oz (that was the weight my dr guessed based on measurements from an ultrasound) anyway my son arrived and he was much bigger than ever guessed 8lb 10oz! I will never forget when he was starting to crown and the dr goes "oh wow, hes a lot bigger than we thought" i was like, yeah thanks, lol. Also i didnt start to show until about 6 weeks and i never got really big|`|J38v75bvaa	nope, your body changes different then everyone else. <br>  <br>  when i had my son, i had only gained 12lbs. my son was 9lbs 12oz!!! and was too big for newborn clothes and diapers, he went right into 0-3months and size 1 diapers!!!<br>  <br>  my sister on the other hand gained almost 60lbs...her daughter was 6lbs 7oz. and was to small for preemie clothes<br>  <br>  and if u have a tiny baby oh well...just as long as its healthy...|`|AA10217725	this is not to disappoint you, but a large, heavy baby will need more space to grow and that way it shows. Not exactly a tiny baby  but maybe smaller. it is not small or big that really  matters, its important to  have a healthy baby.
gPb0s9Ulaa	She's two weeks old.  At this stage she can't be "spoiled" or "over-held."<br>  For the few weeks following birth, there is a huge adjustment period.  Some people even call it the "fourth trimester."<br>  She is so used to be warm, comfortable, and cloase to you that she probably still needs that.<br>  If you really have no interest in comforting her physically at night (as in letting her sleep on you or co-sleeping), then I would swaddler her, make sure she's warm and secure and not lay her down until she's asleep.<br>  BTW she's too young to have colic, she needs YOU!|`|kWEr4Cvuaa	Please be very calm and patience with newborn `cause they`re very sensitive to noise and sound and lights. A quiet and peace place for the bedroom is very important.<br>  The cries of baby`s are their language to tell their complains of hunger, tiredness, sleepy or even mosquitoes bites.<br>  When my little Princess was hungry, she cried out loud. Tiredness the voices were weak while attack by mosquitoes were short and annoying. As for the noises and sound, the voices were .frightened|`|10b2b615c8f0ca19d750e607674a3c6daa	Oh sweetie. Thats just the beginning. I remember about 5 months ago I was on here every night asking What can I do to make him stop!! My son was just like that. You know what I did, not sleep. It's soo hard. Especially when your tired, crying, they're crying and tired. It's rough, but you can and will get through it. I promise.<br>  <br>  One thing I did was co-sleep. My husband and I have a huge king size bed. The only problem is I was worried about rolling over, or my husband rolling over on top of him. My son had to be nestled on/at my chest to sleep. He was like that for about 2 months, then he slept in his crib. It was just one random night and he did it. He woke up to be changed and eat and then went back to sleep.<br>  <br>  If you ever need a late night chat/e-mail buddy I'm here for you. Good luck and try and get some sleep!!|`|1ed613bb747b97b7785ed2c62ec2b592aa	girl, i can relate. my daughter was the same way. whenever i put her down for even a second, shed wake up and start crying. i had a lot of sleepless nights when she was that little. this will pass, and even though its hard you have to remain calm and patient with her.<br>  when your daughter sleeps, you should as well. <br>  if your with her dad, try taking turns with who holds her so that way you get a break and get the sleep you deserve.if thats not an option, call a friend or family member to see if they could watch her for a few hours so you can get some sleep.<br>  <br>  good luck, and remember she is only this little once. as i mentioned itll pass and you wont have to do it forever.|`|JAdNkzENaa	i know it seems mean but you should take 5-10 minutes to get out of the room and let hr cry. <br>  <br>  you dont want to be stressed out and upset. a good mommy is a happy mommy. <br>  <br>  wanting to be held it TOTALLY normal. i wish someone would have told me that!<br>  <br>   my daughter was held for the first 2 months of her life and i was exhausted and frustrated but its just part of it. <br>  <br>  I PROMISE the crying will eventually go away. <br>  <br>  one night it was so bad that i thought of everything and i mean i tried everything (the whole check list)! <br>  <br>  finally i gave her a little warm bath and she calmed down. it'll be ok i promise|`|7PXFXcKfaa	dont worry about it - shes probably just finding it hard to adjust to life on the outside ..<br>  <br>  remember in your tum she was held all the time! <br>  <br>  have you tried a sling? It really worked for my LO! <br>  <br>  good luck - remember to take some time for you - all that crying gets very draining!|`|AA11644170	My niece was the same way.<br>  The only thing that worked was this stuffed mommy arm thing.<br>  I know it sounds really weird but it soothed her. You keep it in your shirt for a few hours and it smells like you and feels like your arm is around her. <br>  It worked wonders for her.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is the link to the arm thing...<br>  <a href="http://www.babylove.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=FUR-00015L&Category_Code=M-B-FUR&vProductIndex=111" rel="nofollow">http://www.babylove.com/mm5/merchant.mvc...</a>|`|YtLYg56Maa	Naww, cute. she loves her mummy! it must be hard. my neighbors have a newborn and the same happens to them. you have to wait a little longer and the child will start getting used to you being distant|`|zQQjw80Caa	Maybe she loves the warmth of your arms. When you know she's in deep sleep, put her down where it's just as warm as being in your arms. Make sure she's wrapped like a burrito in her blanket because newborns love to feel enclosed like that. Do this till the next time you see a doctor for the girls check up.|`|9ISneLnYaa	I had the same problem and someone here suggested white noise, using the hairdryer and as soon as i turned it on she fell asleep so when i put her down into her crib i left the static on the radio. The hoover is very effective as well. Try that and see if it helps!|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	A lot of newborns are like this... she just came into this cold cruel world, all she knows is her mommy. You can get a wrap or a sling and wear her, that way she's close to you and your arms are free. Plus, if you're breastfeeding, you can just latch her while she's in the sling, and literally nurse on the go.<br>  <br>  I quite like Dr Sears' slings <a href="https://www.askdrsears.com/store/Slings.asp" rel="nofollow">https://www.askdrsears.com/store/Slings....</a><br>  <br>  Also, have you tried swaddling her before putting her down? Being wrapped up tightly makes a baby feel more secure... <br>  <br>  Good luck... I know you're tired, but cuddle your baby as much as you can - this time passes very quickly. It gets better I promise you.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your new daughter!|`|145RUNQHaa	Babies this age are too young to be left to cry she's only just come into the world give her time to gain confidence.get a sling and strap her to you so she's close all the time you need to help her feel secure it will settle her.don't listen to anyone who tells you to just leave her to cry that's horrible she's only two weeks old.i carried mine around all day at this age i had them strapped to me in a sling so i had my hands free.they get to know they have you there and they feel more peaceful so they'll be more settled and you'll be able to put her down for longer as she gets older and becomes more interested in what's going on around her.hang in there it's hard but very worth it in the end.i would also speak to your health visitor about this just in case something else is bugging her you never know but more than likely she naturally wants to be held close.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Shes 2 weeks old and the only thing she knows is her mummy's warm womb where she was tight and snug in there, she doesnt know anything different. Have you tried swaddling her, so wrapping her super super tight in a bunny rug or sheet. Theres nothing wrong with holding your baby, hold her as much as possible, they dont stay that little for long trust me. Make sure where you put her is warm and soft. You can also try a wrap which you wear and you can walk around and do housework, go shopping etc with it on and baby is nice and snug in there, you wont believe how well they can sleep in there.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	you need to find a way to handle this with out going insane.<br>  <br>  find a comfortable way for her to sleep on/with you, so you can just enjoy your bond and not worry about anything else.<br>  <br>  maybe you could ask for help with house chores and washing for the next month or so - most people would be delighted to help out!<br>  <br>  have you tried wearing her in a sling? or a baby carrier? that way she is close to her mummy during everyday tasks?<br>  <br>  if a sling doesn't work for you, and you can't seem to find an answer, follow  your daughters lead. and just cuddle cuddle cuddle until she's ready to push you away and be on her own.<br>  lay on your bed with her on your chest or beside you, pat her little bottom and read your favourite book (not childrens book, mummy's book) outloud to her. your voice and the rythmn of the patting will soothe her. once she's asleep, you MIGHT be able to slide off the bed and prop pillows around the outside of the bed?<br>  or try setting up a mattress on the floor and do the same thing.<br>  <br>  or get yourself a super comfy lounge chair, and just sit back and cuddle all day long watching tv, reading books, listening to music and playing with your baby?|`|Vad64Jjoaa	My daughter did the same thing, actually she still does on ocassion. She is now 8 months old. The other day I was trying to make dinner and put her in her walker right next to me and she screamed her head off cause she wanted me to hold her. It does get better. We had a great day today. We played and for the most part she was happy with the holding I was willing and able to give her. I know it sucks, but in a year from now you are going to wish they were like that again. You really can't do anything at 2 weeks old (I wish I could tell you that you could). The house work has to wait, that is what I have learned. Good luck to you, and just wait it gets better. Just remember those months that you couldn't wait for that little one to be in your arms ; )<br>  I had a long talk with my 82 year old Grandma about it one day and she  told me that my Uncle was the same way. They knew so little back then that they thought something was wrong with his back becuase everytime my Grandma would put him down he would scream, LOL. Just be happy that we live in a time where we somewhat understand what is going on with our little ones.|`|AA11285960	maybe swaddling might help? babies like to feel constricted...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_swaddling-your-baby_125.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_swaddling-yo...</a>
EFc8VGwRaa	baby is perfect it is good she is moving alot its when they aint moving so much that something is wrong..my baby boy moved alot as well he made me jump too..dont worry she will be fine and shes just happy and being a lil jumping bean..i too didnt take my vitamins because they made me sick and he turned out perfect..congrats and get used to the beatings lol and just wait until she is turned and is kicking your ribs..that hurts|`|nhhCow4haa	The more she moves the better, it shows she is healthy. It could be a number of reasons, could be something you ate, or she could just feel like running a marathon today. So to speak. I never took prenatal vitamins either, my boy was as healthy as ever. Some babies are even kicking etc when you are in labour. Oh the joys|`|claUGpVRaa	My baby is also that active all the time. I am due on Wednesday this week and mine is till kicking like mad all the time.  It's nothing to worry about honest. I like it myself as it assures me it is okay in there!<br>  Your baby just likes moving around! As it grows it will have less room to move around although if anything like mine, the kicks will become firmer due to lack of space! <br>  I also have not eaten too much throughout my pregnancy due to stress for various reasons but I am assured the baby is just fine! The baby takes all it needs from you, and if anything it is you who will go without so please don't worry (although I know it can get a bit annoying when you are trying to sleep at night and  it is having a disco dance in there!!) Wait until she starts kicking into your ribcage at night! That does hurt!  Good luck to you|`|wKuQC4yTaa	I am 23 weeks too and my little girl is the same way. I felt her at 15 weeks and now that she is bigger its just harder. She has woke me up now. She is pushing away from your hand because she is not sure what it is and likes the extra space, so she uses your hand to push off of. Her active movement is just saying mom im a healthy baby:) let it be a reassuring thing. some women don't get the activity we do and are missing out. enjoy it while you can.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	It's all that junk food- you're giving the poor thing a sugar rush. Rice is a starch. Cupcakes are pure sugar. She eats what you eat, and she needs some veggies. Here's a good recipe that will give her what she needs and still make your sweet tooth happy:<br>   1 bag baby spinach<br>   1 package raspberries <br>   Ken's raspberry walnut vinaigrette<br>  <br>  Just mix it up with just enough of the dressing to partially coat the spinach. It's delicious and it's good for both of you!!|`|EBEa4Q9vaa	SHE GOIN DUMMY UP IN DER. SHE KICKIN BAK|`|MFsuN8Doaa	Your baby is fine, it's when the little thing stops moving which is a cause of concern. <br>  <br>  Your at that stage where you start to feel any and everything - you should enjoy it, because it means your little baby is very happy in there.
JAdNkzENaa	i cant say that i know what dpo is but i know that a line, faint or not is a line girl! you are pregnant!|`|0VHolTVEaa	If its faint its still positive so you may be pregnant. Test in a few days and if its the same go to the doctors for a blood test to be certain. <br>  <br>  I assume 11dpo is 11 days past ovulation? its still early so dont worry dont stress just take another test. Good luck and lots of baby dust xx|`|j7fzuDxgaa	yes it in normal. i used first respone i so wanted to be pregnant i thought there was a faint line but it was a shadow from the plastic line at the back of the test =0(  . just test again in few days should think the line will be stronger, best of luck|`|BWUlksmmaa	I had a faint (but positive) line on a Sainsburys test (ie. not an early testing one) at about 10-11 dpo so there is every chance it is possible, and a line is a line - no false positives so congrats!!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	yes totally normal dont worry faint is because it is so early your hormone levels will be low as yet. also some brands of test dont give very strong lines - particularly internet strips they are known for faint lines.<br>  <br>  congratulations!

P7q9cNaiaa	I feel ya girl! Same situation here, me and my fiance (also nineteen - we're both almost 20) got engaged before we found out, but I just know that our parents won't be too happy since we're both in school still (i'm in nursing school, he's in the fire academy). Your parents will probably be a little dissapointed at first but when you begin to show them that you are responsible and are going tobe mature about this, they will begin to share the excitement with you. <br>  <br>  Just be smart, make sure you're working and go find out about all the programs that can help you (WIC, Title 20, etc...). Hit up your local library and do your reading, and maybe look into a free parenting class in your local area. Show your parents that you can do this!<br>  <br>  *** People are so rude, don't listen to them. I know plenty of people who had babies in their late teens, early twenties, before they were married and they are amazing parents. You can be a great parent, don't listen to any of these naysayers at all.|`|9a98c6a2cb84fbfbec4be6a912bbb028aa	Get together as many good plans for yourself and your upcoming parenthood as you can first.<br>   There is a big difference between telling them if you have a living arrangement, commitment from the father of the baby, decent income prospects vs telling them when you have zero idea how to make it work.<br>   They will take the news a lot better if they don't have to make it all work for you!|`|B8WEoAiKaa	the main thing is that you and your boyfriend are exiticed about baby so the rest is not so important! just tell your parents that you are pregnant and tell them that you are happy and love your baby`s father and will keep the baby!  you must be strong and sure about baby in the front of parents and thats all! everything will be fine and congratulations! :)|`|9DKNSq9daa	Firstly congratulations.<br>  The fact you are keeping the baby is great. Maybe wait till you are 12 weeks when you know everything is ok. This will also give you time to prepare yourselves to tell you family. Your parents will be ok|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	You are an adult. They will simply have to take it for what it is. Just realize that even if they do get upset, they are only disappointed that you didn't wait, not that they are getting a grandchild. They will be okay. Just call and say "Hi Grandma/pa!"|`|mko359wNaa	Hi. I think that however you go about it, you should tell them as soon as possible.

Tell how sorry you are. But then your child is a gift from God. Tell them you don't hesitate being pregnant but the thing is it is nicer if you are not pregnant in that young. I think your mother will understand you in time. So, don't worry too much. It's not good for you and your child inside you.|`|cRxoNPYkaa	Hey, mom.  Remember when I was younger and you told me that I could always talk to you about anything?  Anything at all? Yes?  Well this is one of those times.  I'm going to be having a baby.

Nobody here knows your mom or what relationship you have with her.|`|AA10217725	just tell them. the whole family looks quite freaked out to me so i dont see any problem anywhere.

Ok, here is what you do, get your parents to sit together in a private room of the house where no one can disturb you. Then ask them this question, " How would you feel if I were pregnant?" Then listen to what they say, then just explain to them that you are pregnant. Tell them when it happened, and who the father is. Cause that is the first question they will want to know. Then after that see what your parents say to you. If they get angry just leave into another room until they cool down. Most parents get excited about it and can't wait to see their grandchild. So hopefully your parents will do the same. Then after that your mom(s) will probably be able to help you in finding ways to help your child like wick coupons and where you could get good deals on baby stuff and might even help with tips on taking care of your child. When I told my mom that I was thinking of getting pregnant she was shock but she started to get excited and told me tips on taking care of the baby and where to get help,like wick coupons, and I felt better telling mom about it and believe me you will feel better too. I hope this helps.
s1BaLV1Laa	You get no leak sippy cups that also only water/milk to flow when being sucked. i would suggest one of these.<br>  <br>  here is a link where you can see a number of these, but you can find most of these or once like these in your shop<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babiesgalore.com.au/show_product_search.php?searchtype=category&categoryid=119" rel="nofollow">http://www.babiesgalore.com.au/show_prod...</a>|`|kWEr4Cvuaa	The bottle certainly.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	I would keep doing as you are doing now. Sippy cup during the day and the bottle at night. Even though he is messy now he will get used to it if he has it all the time and the bottle will make sure he gets enough formula to sleep on. He is getting food also during the day so it doesn't matter to much if he spills some. I think you can buy cups that have a no spill component but don't quote me on that. Great job on lasting so long with the breast feeding by the way. It's easy to transfer from bottle to cup later as he grows out of the formula age group.|`|IDmaxViIaa	keep going with sippy cub don't worry if he's messy just do it do he gets used to it i've done that will my 4 kids but my fifth alisha is only 2 weeks old but in the future as soon as they reach 10 months the bottles are gone for me.|`|8e7ZxOL1aa	keep him on bottle all i can say my son is 13 months old and hes still messy with sippy cup and pores it every were so yer bottle go both tho sippy day only water other wise u got milk stains every were and once hes used to it the try the milk|`|bvLvOqIzaa	Bubs shouldn't drink anything|`|SSM3u4l4aa	I suggest going with the sippy cup during the day and the bottle at bedtime. I have a little girl and at first she was messy with her sippy cup too but she got better- and I got a bit smarter. You can get spill proof sippy cups that have a rubber stopper in them that requires him to suck before any liquid will come out. <br>  <br>  The transfer to the cup from the bottle went pretty easy for me. I took her off the bottle before she was really old enough to get attached to it. I gradually took the bottles away one at a time and threw them away. And when we were down to one I gave it to her less and less. She didn't even really notice when she didn't get one anymore.. not that I could see. She was off the bottle before she was one and a half completely. <br>  Good luck!!

2HETgiwgaa	It will be very difficult for you to conceive with such a short cycle.  It sounds like you might have a hormonal problem that you really need to see a doctor about.  The time after you ovulate until you have you period is called the luteal phase, and if it is too short (under 10 days - known as a luteal phase defect) your body won't be able to sustain a pregnancy.  There are medications your doctor can give you to help with this, though, so the best thing to do for now is to go and talk this through with him/her.<br>  <br>  You can chart your basal body temperature (BBT), and try using ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) to see if you are ovulating.  Your body temperature goes up after you ovulate because of the progesterone.  OPKs test for a surge in the hormone (luteneising hormone) that helps you ovulate.  For more information about how to use BBT (which is the primary way for you to be able to check for yourself if you are ovulating), I'd recommend fertilityfriend.com.  It's a charting website which includes a free course that will teach you how to chart your fertility signs, like BBT and cervical mucous (CM). <br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust.
hZ7AfJPSaa	are you 21 weeks and 4 days pregnant... a little confused based on the information given, sorry.<br>  <br>  But if you are 21 weeks 4 days pregnant ... then I assume you conceived between the 5th to the 13th of October.<br>  <br>  Your ovulation day should have been  October 9th.|`|S62OV6eqaa	you can get pregnant anytime you have sex.

He then decided to be 6 days late! lol|`|Bg6txvxqaa	There shouldn't be too many problems at this stage, just remember that you should go to the hosp straight away (after phoning in of course) if you start to get contractions as they may need to inject you with steroids or something similar to strengthen your baby's lungs.<br>  <br>  After 24 weeks a baby is deemed viable for survival and the difference between a baby born at 24 weeks and one born at 30 weeks is immense!<br>  <br>  Everything should be fine, especially any time after 34 weeks.|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Babies have about a 95% percent chance of survival if born at 30 weeks. Those odds go up every week she's in the dark confines of the womb. The lungs are a little immature at 30 weeks, but a few weeks in NICU soon sorts that out.. So the answer is yes. If your baby was to be born at 30 gestation, her chances of survival are more than brilliant.. She'd be a little red, smaller and skinnier than usual, and she may have to spend up to a month in a special little plastic box so she can rest and get a little pinker and plumper whilst a noisy machine does the breathing for her to save her the strain, but you WOULD definitely be taking her home at the end of it, She'd have to be really poorly not to survive, So don't worry She'd be fine. My cousin was born at 22 weeks gestation back in 1974. His chances of survival were less than 11% but 34 years on, he's a happy and healthy nuisance..|`|AA11644170	My niece was born just shy of three months early and she is a happy healthy perfectly normal 1 1/2 year old now.<br>  She had to stay in the hospital for about 7 weeks and came home on a breathing and heart monitor for the first couple of months.|`|4jeqIx6Paa	im 30 weeks and 5 days i just woke up my palm and feet are sweaty and im having braton hicks every 3 min. but they dont hurt but im scared because i feel like puking i dont know what this means am i gonna have her ealy?|`|JDw1RDcaaa	her chance to survive will double at week 35 but before then they can survive but she would be very ill cuz her lungs, kidneys aren't formed at this stage and she hasnt even got finger nails at that stage.|`|LQnKhiVMaa	i would day she will have a very good chance of survival, and even greater at 35 weeks, i am sure u will be fine  x xcongrats, not long now x
fBhXFLSUaa	everyone feels discomfort during pregnancy having sex, and msot women are complelty turned off im 4 months and me and my partner havin had sex for two months but he understand we already have a 6 year old son togehter so he knows im just feeling same as i did on him so he dosn but any pressure on me as soon as i had him couldn keep my hands away from my partner so im sure if you explain this to your husband that is only for a few months and there is other things you s can do instead of full intercourse anyway try exploring and have fun|`|1CryEnb3aa	Try and talk to your husband about it.  Maybe if you two try again and take it real easy, it won't hurt your stomach as bad.  Worth a shot.   Good luck|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Is this your first baby? If it is, you are just nervous about making love with your hubby. This will not hurt your baby and you can do it up until you go into labor to deliver. Try to relax and enjoy having sex now, you don't need to hold back anything because you are already PG.|`|R5dMLVlIaa	try a different position. when you are pregnant, it is usually best to be on top or 'doggy' style.  if you do it missionary position, you can feel some discomfort.<br>  <br>  also, just communicate to your husband how you feel...  pregnancy is tough on our bodies.  hopefully he'll be understanding.|`|52U22fiAaa	Take a break and try not to stress about the sex so much.  Try again in a week or so.  If it continues to be uncomfortable, then you two might have to find alternative ways to bond and pleasure one another!  I'm sure your hubby will understand if you explain to him how you're feeling.|`|RGn4ry2zaa	Wait for the baby.|`|lcBrAk2laa	hi.. im 39 weeks pregnant.. ive had that problem and consulted my doctor.. but its nothing t orry about... your bdy is changing due to your pregnancy and your hormones will be all over the place too... later on in your pegnancy you might not feel like having sex at all... i didnt... but pleasuring your husband wouldnt go a miss..<br>  although he should understand..|`|woCRQVgtaa	Don't worry about him...worry about your baby first.

PBOWJYQ6aa	You and your baby are both going to be fine. The doctor is aware of the situation, and if the bleeding increases, they will deliver. If you are not already in the hospital, it is because your doctor determined that you can safely stay home for now. He/she would not risk a huge lawsuit by sending you home when it is not safe to do so. If you still don't feel comfortable being at home, go back to the hospital. Otherwise relax and be prepared to return if the bleeding returns or increases. You are going to be okay. It was probably just a small tear that healed itself.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	You should be delivering your baby any time now. With the placenta tore and bleeding you need to be in the delivery room having a beautiful baby. So, get going, to the emergency room and delivery room from there.<br>    Congratulations on your baby.|`|52U22fiAaa	The placenta is VERY important in the pregnancy.  It keeps the baby alive.  If you're 8.5 months pregnant, then the baby can be delivered safely with minimal risk.|`|lCKG5X1Oaa	Basically the placenta is the way the only way the baby is alive. But if your eight and a half months prego, then  you could get a c-section and still have a healthy child.|`|1CryEnb3aa	The placenta is the life line to your baby.  Very important.  What did your dr tell you?  Is he gonna induce you?  Your placenta sounds like it is ready to be done with this pregnancy.  Maybe you will go into labor soon.  I would ask your dr more questions.  Good luck|`|cWuumdy7aa	In the majority of pregnancies, the placenta forms in the top half of the womb. In some cases, however, it forms in the lower half, so that it lies partly or completely over the cervix, blocking the baby's way out of the womb. This is known as a low-lying placenta (or placenta praevia).<br>  <br>  The position of your placenta can be shown by an ultrasound scan. If you have a scan in the first half of your pregnancy that shows that your placenta is low-lying, this isn't usually any cause for concern. As many as one in four placentas may be low-lying in mid-pregnancy. The likelihood is that as your womb gets bigger, the placenta will move up (it doesn’t actually ‘move’ as such, but as the womb grows, the area to which the placenta is attached stretches upwards, away from the cervix). If your placenta is shown to be low-lying in mid-pregnancy, you’re likely to be offered another scan later on (usually around 32-34 weeks) to check that it has moved. Only 0.5 per cent -1 per cent of placentas remain low-lying at the end of pregnancy. However, when this happens, it can cause problems.<br>  What problems does it cause?<br>  <br>  The main problem that a low-lying placenta can cause is bright red bleeding from the vagina during the later stages of pregnancy. The bleeding may stop and start at first, and is painless. It happens because the lower part of your womb is starting to change shape and thin out in readiness for your baby to be born, but because the placenta can't stretch in the same way, it peels away at the edges, which causes bleeding.<br>  <br>  At first, the bleeding is usually slight, but there's a risk that it might become heavy at any time without warning. Heavy bleeding may be accompanied by signs of shock - paleness, sweating and an increased pulse.<br>  <br>  If you haven’t had a scan that has shown the position of your placenta and you experience this kind of bleeding, it may be an indication that the placenta is low-lying. Another sign that you might have a low-lying placenta is that your baby is lying in an awkward position in your womb - for example from side to side, or at an angle.<br>  <br>  Will it harm my baby?<br>  <br>  Having a low-lying placenta won't in itself harm your baby. If it causes bleeding, the blood comes from the mother, not from the baby, although it's occasionally possible that the baby might lose some blood too. Sometimes, however, if the bleeding is serious, it's necessary to deliver the baby early.<br>  <br>  What can be done about it?<br>  <br>  Unless the low-lying placenta causes bleeding, there is nothing that needs to be done about it. However, if you have any bleeding at any time, consult your doctor immediately. If he or she suspects that the bleeding is due to a low-lying placenta, you will be advised to have an ultrasound scan. If the diagnosis is confirmed by the scan, the treatment will depend on exactly where the placenta is lying, how many weeks pregnant you are, and how much bleeding you've had.<br>  <br>  If the placenta is lying across the cervix, there's a very high risk that you'll experience more bleeding, which could be extremely heavy and put both you and your baby's lives at risk. Because of this you'll almost certainly be advised to stay in hospital until your baby is born. There's still a possibility that the placenta may move away from the cervix, but this becomes less likely as your pregnancy advances. You may be offered repeated scans to check whether the placenta is moving or not. If it doesn't move, the only way that your baby can be born is by Caesarean. This will usually be carried out at around 38 weeks.<br>  <br>  If the placenta is only partly over the cervix, you'll probably still be advised to stay in hospital for the rest of your pregnancy because of the risk that you might bleed at any time. You'll need to discuss with your doctor whether to have the baby normally or by Caesarean. Some doctors will always recommend a Caesarean because of the risk of bleeding with a normal birth.<br>  <br>  What if I don't want to have a scan?<br>  <br>  You don't have to have a scan if you don't want to. However, if you've had any painless bright red bleeding, this does indicate that you may have a low-lying placenta, and you'll be advised to stay in hospital in case you bleed more.<br>  <br>  A low-lying placenta can also be diagnosed by an internal examination, but because there's a risk that this can cause heavy bleeding, it's only ever carried out in a hospital operating theatre, with preparations for surgery already done, so that the baby can be immediately delivered by Caesarean if necessary. For this reason, an internal examination will not be carried out unless the baby is mature enough to be born.
crutXlguaa	Everything you said sounds promising (at least judging from all the info I read on the Internet since I myself am trying to get pregnant for 5 months now). Well, sore boobs could be a sign, though I usually have cramps, sore boobs and pimples on my face and on my body right before I get my period. But if you have never had this before that could also be a sign. They say PMS and pregnancy symptoms are so much alike that you will actually NEED to miss a period and see a positive on HPT to be absolutely sure, otherwise you might think your period is about to start because of the cramps and everything, but in fact you might be pregnant and the opposite. So I would suggest testing first thing tom morrow morning if your AF does not show up (I really hope so). Wishing you a LOT OF BABY DUST!!|`|BWUlksmmaa	PMS and early pregnancy symptoms are very very similar so unless you do a test, or AF comes, you won't know.  But before my positive test, I started getting pimples on my back and I NEVER get them on my back so knew something wasn't right - turns out it was the hormones kicking in already...so maybe if you never get them on your face and suddenly you do...good luck either way.|`|7G8w8TZcaa	i had the same symptoms,specialy the white lotion discharge.tested 6 days before my periods were due & got positive.ur signs sound promising hon.tons of baby dust coming ur way.|`|JjBwydymaa	To be honest hun... i think the sore boobs could be related to pregnancy but the itchy and sore vagina can be related to an infection like thrush. <br>  <br>  But good luck hunni in TTCx|`|2YCqw8mbaa	You better consult a lady doctor and if u are pregnant she will test your urine and find out.  For itching and other complaints she will give u medicine.  Do not delay.
2HETgiwgaa	No, it isn't normal to have your period so frequently, and yes that could be why you haven't gotten pregnant.<br>  <br>  In order to sustain a pregnancy, you need to have a luteal phase (the time between ovulation and your period) of at least 10 days (some doctors think less than 12 is a problem).  If you have a short luteal phase, that is known as a luteal phase defect, and could be caused by a hormonal problem.  This is something you doctor can help you with.<br>  <br>  If you haven't been charting, you might find it helpful to start - then you will also have records you can take to your doctor to show what's been happening.  Try fertilityfriend.com or mymonthlycycles.com.  <br>  <br>  But, since you've already been trying for nearly 2 years, I would make an appointment to see your doctor straight away - the sooner you see them, the sooner you can get some help.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust.|`|JjBwydymaa	I think you need to go back to the doctors hun and let them do some tests on you.. It dosnt sound normal to bleed that much!<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|crutXlguaa	I would suggest going to the doctors as soon as possible to check everything up with you and your hubby. They say it takes a year for healthy couples to get pregnant and after trying for one it is suggested to see a fertility doc. I am sure there are lot of things s/he can advice and offer to better your chances of conception. You might have a minor hormonal imbalance which causes the failure to get pregnant, so I would strongly recommend seeing a doc. <br>  <br>  WISHING YOU LOT OF BABY DUST!!!
2zC1lpfVaa	Yes, very silly.  Cause at 12 dpo your body may have not built up enough HCG even to be detected by the 1st morning urine.  And with the 3er pee of the morning, the hormone content would be even lower.|`|1tm132Neaa	I just did the clearblue digital yesterday one day early and it said the same to me but my period will be two days late in a few hours. Sigh. No idea what to think. I think they can need more hcg than other brands so I'd retest in a few days. 12 dpo is fairly early. :D|`|xwOwsZvEaa	thats what i did but surely 12 dpo is too early try to forget about it and wait till u have actually missed your period.<br>  its so hard when i just want to take another test!<br>  good luck|`|ca03c4dbfbf739cc439141f60d700173aa	I've got a positive with a CB digital at 11dpo before, but that was with FMU, and every pregnancy is different. It all depends when implantation takes place.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	If you want an accurate result test with the FIRST morning urine the day of your missed period|`|JjBwydymaa	Hunni..<br>  <br>  Just wait until you miss your period.. .else you may get false negatives. <br>  <br>  Its only 2 more days to do (if your cycles is 28 days) <br>  <br>  But good luck and lots of baby dust x
BYWjXuIUaa	hi.. children at that age wants to be alone and wants to play by themselves. children undergo tantrums most of the time. just let them be. did you scold her before she acted that way? well.. try to give her sometime maybe she is preoccupied with something. observe her and if it get worse, that's the time you bring her to a child therapist..<br>  dont get mad at her. if you show her you're mad, definitely she will continue to do the act =)|`|FuR0RpCfaa	Are you frustrated around her frequently? Do you praise her? Do you act interested in what she wants to do? Do you plan fun interactive play where she can talk louder than normal? Does she watch Dora the explorer because it helps with speech and its really fun for kids of all ages even adults watching with their kids. If any of the things I mentioned you are lacking in try doing more of it. I know work and household and significant others take up a lot of time but your child can sense when you are stressed out and will withdraw from you or misbehave to get your attention. If not talking gets attention then she will do that as much as possible.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Maybe something has upset her.  Have you tried singing songs with her and reading story books with good and silly rhymes in them and good pictures with words to say and to talk about?  Eg. I know an old lady that swallowed a fly, Dr Suess, Richard Scarry, that sort of thing. Get her to make up good nicknames for people and animals and ask her about her favourite topics.   As frustrating as it is, getting annoyed probably doesn't help.  Maybe you can get to the bottom of what the story is.  Also, might be way off the mark, but have you had her ears and hearing checked? Good luck.|`|avpv7u8saa	maybe something is bothering her..Take her to a child therapist
Jcz29H2Oaa	omg what a perfect little pregnant bump! you have the cutest tummy! everyone shows at different times, but yours looks just fine :) i wish i could show pics of my tummy lol but i was chubby before i got preggo and now im getting stretch marks... sooo uhhg... enjoy your belly hun! good luck & congrats with your baby!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fBhXFLSUaa	no your about average at that stage, im 4 months two and on my second child which your suppose to get bigger even quicker on and i have hardly any bump yet only gained 4 pound so far was a bit worried so posted a comment on here everyones different i was huge twice size as you on my first pregnancy was way to big your bumps really cute, can't wait to get mine and start showing it off|`|iR9w7d7Yaa	Hiya,<br>  You look fine, i am 21 weeks and am just a little bigger then you! I can't wait to get a proper bump. <br>  All the best xx|`|OMTSqrSFaa	not you look fine to Me ... remember every 1 is different And grow & carry different x|`|h85kkDsbaa	Your bump looks about the right size to me, some people dont show at all at 4 months.|`|lzUF22l0aa	no every pregnancy is diffrent|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	no most ppl arent even showing at 4 months|`|79eRDIbXaa	Looks about right to me.<br>  Good Luck and Congratz xx|`|woCRQVgtaa	You look great at 4 months!  Every women is different.  My wife gained 75 lbs during her pregnancy while my close friend gained only 35.  As long as what's inside is healthy and you're taking care of yourself, you should be okay.  Congratulations!|`|EyKJ737daa	You look just fine sweetie, as a previous poster has written, every woman is different and carries differently.  It's just how your body distributes it that determines when you start showing and how big you get.  You look just fine though, Congratulations sweetie and all the best for a happy pregnancy and a safe delivery xx|`|JjBwydymaa	You bump looks gorgeous now hunni. I think it looks fine!<br>  <br>  Some people are bigger than others  but you look about normal to me! <br>  <br>  xx|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	No you look great and about the right size - but everyone is different remember.  Don't wish it to be too big too soon!  It gets heavy to carry around.  It's great for getting comments and stares if you're into that sort of thing, but very uncomfortable!|`|yNoENquTaa	wow. everyone is different. i'm just coming up to four months and no one knows i'm pregnant unless i tell them. so i think your size is very good. i think your baby is beautiful. =]|`|Bg6txvxqaa	You look fine to me! I'm only a little bit bigger than you are and I'mm 22 weeks with twins so it looks like it's all going well for you!|`|M5HyStReaa	I would say no. I am 22 weeks gone and look smaller than you and baby is spot on sizewise according to last week's scan
eKtEWrcmaa	Thats so heartbreaking but completely natural. I'd keep having her see the therapist. Even if it takes a few times before she starts to talk to them. <br>  <br>  She's probably scared of losing you also in addition to the trauma of losing her birth mom. Losing someone suddenly is hard for a young child to handle regardless of the relationship. <br>  <br>  Have you talked to the therapist or psychologist? They will probably have good suggestions for you on how to handle the situation and what you can do at home to help her work through her grief and fear.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	She is afraid of, losing you, too.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	She doesn't want to leave you because she is afraid to lose you|`|VFrnaad7aa	It is natural. Her mind was thinking that she could not see her real mom.|`|d1P05XfPaa	You are one of a kind! <br>  Keep up the good work!<br>  God Bless!
PBOWJYQ6aa	You are doing everything you can do. Just hold her when she hurts. My children's father died in a car accident when they were 11 and 13, and although we had been divorced for ten years and they never saw much of him, they still lost an important part of their lives. That's not easy, but in time, they got through it. Just get life back to normal as soon as she'll let you, because that will help her to realize that life goes on, and it's okay. Let her grieve, but don't let her obsess. Make cookies with her. If she is able to help, let her help, but if she can't, let her tell you what kind of sprinkles she wants on them. Give her a sense of control. I think that between the cerebral palsy and the loss of her mother, a sense of control is probably the most important gift you can give her right now. Good luck.|`|IDmaxViIaa	thats sad maby get her to talk to her friend about it cause when she gets it out she won't as upset.
79eRDIbXaa	More then likely you are Absolutely fine even if you have a bladder infection. They will just put you on some anti- biotics to clear it up. The only thing to worry about with a bladder infection is that if they are not treated early enought then it can cause a kidney iinfection. Kidney Infections are not so good in pregnancy as they can cause Pre- Term Labour. Don'tWorry ok - Good Luck and Congats xx|`|JDw1RDcaaa	i have had four urine infections while being pregnant and they cant harm your baby, but if they go undetected for weeks and weeks then YOU could end up with a kidneys infection|`|1CryEnb3aa	You deffinately don't want to get a kidney infection.  And that can happen if it is put off too long.  You would know if you had had one at this point.  You low back would hurt real bad and it would hurt very much bad to pee.  Your pee would have a foil odor as well, and run a fever.  Good luck and don't worry about your baby being effected yet.  Good luck
XOnSRoR2aa	Are you anxious or upset about anything? I think you may be having a panic attack because you are experiencing some of the classic symptoms of one. It would be extraordinarily rare for you to be having a heart attack, stroke, or anything else that serious at 16, and you'll most likely start to feel better if you take some deep breaths, listen to some soothing music and drink a small glass of water. If the symptoms persist or get worse tonight, go talk to your parents, and if necessary see a doctor. <br>  <br>  Sometimes we're so busy throughout the day that we don't have time to really stop and think about the things that are bothering us, but they come flooding in at night when we are lying there in bed, and the emotion and worry can cause a rush of adrenaline which creates the symptoms you're describing.<br>  <br>  Turn off your computer and dim the lights in the room. Put on some chillaxing music and your most comfortable pajamas. Take ten slow, deep breaths. Do some light yoga stretches to release some of the tension in your body. While you are in bed, tense up all the muscles in your body starting from your toes and moving up, then release each one; this will relax your body. Make sure your room isn't too cold or warm. Focus on positive thoughts. Try to go to sleep, but if you can't, take a warm bath or read a book or watch something funny on TV for a little while until you feel more calm and start to really become tired. I struggle with insomnia, and these things usually help me. <br>  <br>  Good luck. : )|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Get it checked ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  The pain in your left arm, combined with a rapidly beating heart are, two signs of a heart attack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|XLJHECEeaa	How much do you weight? That could be a big factor, because with weight can come a lot of problems. I think you should go get checked out also, by doctor.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	Get it checked out sounds serious|`|d1P05XfPaa	You have heart problem! <br>  That's a sign! Your left arm!|`|JsffWlnEaa	those are the symptoms of a stroke|`|VFrnaad7aa	I think it is your funny bone and you are nervous on what's gonna happen.

sxecXFgraa	I spank my kids and spanking is a last resort.  Depending on the situation, I think it can be combined with something else.  After about 12, you shouldn't have to spank your child.  I say that now but my kids aren't there yet.  Who knows, they may do something at 14 that I feel deserves a pop.  I wished timeouts worked for every kid and situation but they don't.  Not all kids are the same so it amazes me that some parents feel the same punishment will work on all kids.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? I think spanking is okay as long as its not a hard hit. Just enough spank in it to embarrass the child. I think it's okay from toddler age, to 7 years old. It embarrasses them, and then they don't do it again. ?¤·?|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	How do I feel about spanking???<br>  <br>  It sure has been uncomfortable on my backside.<br>  <br>  But it sure is a quick way to learn a "lesson"<br>  And knowing parents' love and affection 24/7/365 then a RARE bare belting of a couple of minutes, we can accept. Get it, learn from it, get over it, get on with life.<br>  <br>  Seems every child is different and every parent is different. IMO, use on it's own OR use grounding "as a last resort"; Rarely should spanking be used WITH grounding.<br>  <br>  How old is too old?  Well, many guys really don't "need" a spanking once they have reached 13 years of age; maybe even sooner. However, others (some of us) can sure benefit from the RARE one even at 14 or 15, maybe even 16.  Too old? Well, I guess once a kid is out of college and earning his own way in the world.<br>  .|`|f9lO5MIraa	It had better be a pretty severe infraction, never do it in anger and always make sure the kid knows exactly why it is happening.<br>  <br>  Always do it away from other kids also.  The embarrassment could be bad.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Spanking should be reserved for 2 consenting adults period.<br>  It should never be used on anyone smaller than you.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I don't believe in it, From Birth is too old. And should never be started in the first place.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	It really depends on the kid. Spanking is a great way to make quick corrections if you don't over do it. The mistake that I made was in not believing in spankings. I stood my children in the corner for time-outs. (can also be effective depending on the child). The corner worked great on my son, but my daughter could not tolerate it. When she became an adult, I discovered that the corner was one of the biggest reasons that I never got a grip on her. I stood them in the corner for one minute per year of age, as recommended by whatever book I had read at the time. Turns out she would have responded better to the quick discipline of a spanking. She didn't have a long enough attention span for time-outs to work. <br>  It also depends on the offense. Let the punishment fit the crime. My best piece of creative genius came to me when my children cut holes in my waterbed. I gave them each a teaspoon and a bucket and walked away. They figured out that they were supposed to spoon the water out of the bed the hard way. After about half an hour, I came in, made sure they both had about the same amount of water in their buckets, and let them off the hook. They never forgot that lesson.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	I do not have children of my own, but I can remember getting spanked as a child. My parents by no means abused me, it was discipline plain and simple. They would take me outside and bust my butt and bring me back in to wherever we were crying. Spanking at my house was a hand on the butt, but was also, a switch, which did not hurt very much.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think that is what is wrong with children today, their parents refuse to spank them for being bad or they are just plain afraid. <br>  <br>  On it's own until it doesn't work anymore and then do the grounding. Between the ages of 2 and 12. 13 is old enough to start being grounded.|`|124377045ceac9826f76a176d439bd8faa	I think there is way too little spanking these days. With most kids and most parents spanking, as simplistic as it sounds, can make a big difference.<br>  <br>  I do not believe, in most cases, in a punishment in addition to the spanking. One of the benefits of spanking is that it is over quickly, the point is made, the air is cleared and we can move on.<br>  <br>  The only exceptions are when something more is really required. Like one time my daughter also had to apologize to our neighbor, in addition to getting her bottom warmed, for being rude and obnoxious.<br>  <br>  As far as age, I intend to follow what my Mom told me when I told her I was too old to be spanked:<br>  <br>  "When you quit acting like a child, you will be too old for a childish punishment."<br>  <br>  It seems kind of silly to me to suddenly retire the paddle on some particular date--it will just gradually fade out.<br>  <br>  Even though I almost never got spanked in my early teens, I know for a fact that there were times my behavior was changed by the image in my head of Mom greeting me with her hairbrush in hand. So there was value in leaving the possibility open.|`|Sb93dIXbaa	One to two years old slap on the hand for knocking or touching things they are not supposed to do. One swat on the butt which doesn't hurt through to diaper but gets their attention, Three to to eight or nine light spanking with hand eight or nine swats no beatings. And ten through the teenage years restrictions you can't out and play or go to the movie or dance.And you should have raised a good child. Remember parents time outs don't hurt not that you want to hurt your child and also its not a shock attention getter.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	13<br>   should be the end of corporal punishment, even the most well intended kind.<br>  It should be used sparingly and in only the most extreme circumstances for the best effect.<br>  Not all kids need it but for some it's mandatory.|`|qxbWW6Cxaa	i feel spankings are neccescary but only at certain times. Grounding does punish children im telling u that right now. i was spanked as a kid 1 time! im serious 1 time! and i never did anything to have to get one if those again. but yes i think there to old for that at age 11. good luck|`|RDgyb7W8aa	I am from the old school.  I believe that sparing the rod spoils the child. When is it too old, when you are out on your own. When they live in my house they live by my rules.|`|WfotGbjNaa	i would never spank my child at all|`|wORqCGlyaa	it sounds barbaric but spanking is sometimes the only thing a child will learn from. people think that putting your child in time out or on restriction will teach them, but in fact the only thing that this teaches them is that their worst punishment will be to have their x-box taken away. im not saying to beat your child but put the fear into them and make them think, when they are about to do something wrong they will remember this and think twice. i am tired of people who just let their kids run wild and dint punish them because they think its wrong. ive been in law enforcement for several years and i see that the problem child are the ones who have no discipline. the parents think its ok to let their kids run wild but then they wonder why a few years later that same kid is in a juvenile detention center|`|9ee9d8dfb116ccbe7884f6ff20c1af67aa	As a kid I was "punished" I got the belt, nothing severe (it wasn't super hard) but trust me it isn't cool, and afterward the parent will feel so guilty they usually apologize anyway.
EyKJ737daa	Yes tinned fruit is just fine.  Depending on what you give him, just make sure there are no pips left as some do have warnings on the cans that pips may be still be present.  Soft fruit like mangos, peaches, apricots and pears are good for little ones.  Sounds like you doing a great job though with his fresh fruit already but yes having some in the cupboard for "just in case" is a fantastic idea especially if you can't get to the shops to get some or they are out of his favourites.  Well done mummy and keep up the great work :-)|`|7lPspOboaa	I buy the brand that cans in pear juice as opposed to syrup.

The ones which are in syrup contain far too much sugar.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	my little one use to love the tinned orange segmants but only when they were cold from the fridge<br>  <br>  also peaches and pears i think coz they were nce and soft make sure they in natural jucie and not the syrup kind x x

EyKJ737daa	Mums often know best because we are with them more often and know when something is not right.  I'd do the same, I'd keep him home from daycare.  He does sound like he may have picked up a tummy bug.  Monitor him for the next 1-2 days and if he continues to throw up, I'd take him off to the doctors.  He may get better in the next couple of days and throw up the bug that is making him sick and if that is the case, great.  Try and keep as much fluid up to him as possible.  Sometimes when they are unwell and running a fever, they know themselves that they need to keep drinking and they do, my 3 year old has done this when she had a fever not long ago and she just kept drinking and drinking but eating little and within 24 hours she came good!  I'm sure your little boy will do the same too. Keep an eye on him and if he gets worse, definitely take him to the hospital or doctor but if he gets no worse then that's a good sign too.  All the best sweetie and lots of cuddles and hugs for your little boy xx|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	mothers instinct is best|`|h85kkDsbaa	Hi there, i work in a nursery and we always say that if you feel your little one is poorly to keep them at home.

lzEuuseJaa	I've never heard of any such facility and I'm familiar with the area. If you're using Huntington Hospital, they would tell you if there was such a facility. Your OB's office would be familiar with it, too. There is a Ronald McDonald House near Huntington Hospital, but that's only for families who have children in the hospital with very serious illnesses, and there isn't enough room for all those that need to stay there.<br>  <br>  Maybe they thought you meant a facility for abused pregnant women and their children? There is one in Pasadena, but that doesn't seem like what you're asking about. Let me know if it is and I'll give you more info.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
pzLDXL6gaa	You take it very soon after sex and it's quite effective (but not perfect) at preventing pregnancy. It delays ovulation and/or stops fertilisation and implantation. If you're already pregnant it won't do anything.<br>  <br>  Harriet
1CryEnb3aa	I think it sounds really low.  Check this web site out.  Good luck.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Check out this website it should explain everything. . . . <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringpregnancy/hcglevels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringp...</a>|`|vcxzt3R6aa	as long as your numbers are doubling you should be ok. are they going to test you again to check?<br>  Key things to remember about hCG levels:<br>  In a bout 85% of normal pregnancies, the hCG level will double every 48 - 72 hours. As you get further along in pregnancy and the hCG level gets higher, the time it takes to double can increase to about every 96 hours. <br>  Caution must be used in making too much of hCG numbers. A normal pregnancy may have low hCG levels and result in a perfectly healthy baby. The results from an ultrasound after 5 - 6 weeks gestation are much more accurate than using hCG numbers. <br>  An hCG level of less than 5mIU/ml is considered negative for pregnancy, and anything above 25mIU/ml is considered positive for pregnancy. <br>  The hCG hormone is measured in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/ml). <br>  A transvaginal ultrasound should be able to show at least a gestational sac once the hCG levels have reached between 1,000 - 2,000mIU/ml. Because levels can differentiate so much and conception dating can be wrong, a diagnosis should not be made by ultrasound findings until the hCG level has reached at least 2,000. <br>  A single hCG reading is not enough information for most diagnoses. When there is a question regarding the health of the pregnancy, multiple testings of hCG done a couple of days apart give a more accurate assessment of the situation. <br>  <br>  Guideline to hCG levels during pregnancy:<br>  hCG levels in weeks from LMP (gestational age)* :<br>  <br>  3 weeks LMP: 5 - 50 mIU/ml <br>  4 weeks LMP: 5 - 426 mIU/ml <br>  5 weeks LMP: 18 - 7,340 mIU/ml <br>  6 weeks LMP: 1,080 - 56,500 mIU/ml <br>  7 - 8 weeks LMP: 7, 650 - 229,000 mIU/ml <br>  9 - 12 weeks LMP: 25,700 - 288,000 mIU/ml <br>  13 - 16 weeks LMP: 13,300 - 254,000 mIU/ml <br>  17 - 24 weeks LMP: 4,060 - 165,400 mIU/ml <br>  25 - 40 weeks LMP: 3,640 - 117,000 mIU/ml <br>  Non-pregnant females: <5.0 mIU/ml <br>  Postmenopausal females: <9.5 mIU/ml <br>  * These numbers are just a GUIDELINE-- every woman’s level of hCG can rise differently. It is not necessarily the level that matters but rather the change in the level.<br>  <br>  What can a low hCG level mean?<br>  A low hCG level can mean any number of things and should be rechecked within 48-72 hours to see how the level is changing. A low hCG level could indicate:<br>  <br>  Miscalculation of pregnancy dating <br>  Possible miscarriage or blighted ovum <br>  Ectopic pregnancy <br>  <br>  What can a high hCG level mean?<br>  A high level of hCG can also mean a number of things and should be rechecked within 48-72 hours to evaluate changes in the level. A high hCG level can indicate:<br>  <br>  Miscalculation of pregnancy dating <br>  Molar pregnancy <br>  Multiple pregnancy|`|V8JtHopoaa	Yes. I miscaried at 6 week and aparently my hcg dropped dramaticaly, it was only 25. then the next day it was 0.8. So yes thats normal. I went on a website but i cant remember what it was called.

2HETgiwgaa	Six days is about the earliest a fertilised egg will have implanted and for your body to be producing the hormone (hCG - human chorionic gonadotropin) that home pregnancy tests (hpts) test for.  But, it can take longer than that for the egg to implant - and every women is different as to how long it takes for the hormone to build up.  If you were able to find a test that was sensitive enough to detect hCG at 6 days, it would also carry the risk of a false positive.  You'll hear people talk about the two week wait (2WW) because 14 days post ovulation (dpo) is really the earliest recommended time to test - to avoid the disappointment and cost of false negatives.  Some women don't get positives for several weeks or more, though.  The best thing to do is to wait until at least the day your period would be due before you test, make sure you use first morning urine, and get multi-test packs of the hpts - so that if you get a negative, you can wait a few days and test again.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Wait at least 2 weeks for best result<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|JjBwydymaa	2-3 weeks...

Anything with hops will help also, I think that's what she meant by beer. Not just any kind will do. Do some research and find one that has a high hop content.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	First off - are you sure you're not producing enough? Women often mistake the real signs of low supply. Your breasts don't have to feel engorged to have milk in them. Expressing milk is no indication of how much you produce as pumps are not as effective as baby. If baby is gaining weight well and wetting lots of nappies, then it's unlikely that you have a supply problem. That said, it does happen...<br>  Your body works on a supply and demand basis, so try to express and nurse as often as you can, including through the night. Make sure you are drinking enough water and you calorie intake is at least at the minimum (I believe it's 2500 a day while breastfeeding, that's open for correction). You could also try fenugreek supplements from the health food store. Or Mother's Milk Tea. These both help to increase supply. Also, oatmeal can help to boost it too.<br>  Good luck!|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	Easy question<br>  <br>  Oatmeal<br>  Anisee tea<br>  Chamamile tea<br>  Warm shower over shoulders and breasts (not too too hot or will dry up breasts)<br>  Express milk straight after a feed<br>  Glacta herbs such as fenugreek (tea works better than capsules but both really bring on the milk)<br>  have read beer but I dont like the idea of alcohol in any bf mums system<br>  a massage from hubby<br>  some people go so far as getting hubby to stimulate breasts during love making<br>  lots of water<br>  lots of plenty fruit and veges in your diet.

433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	My midwife said the best time to go is between 28-30 weeks. I went at 28 weeks for my 3d/4D and the pics were a lot clearer as I was able to see everything! Even muffin one sucking his thumb, and muffin 2 covering his eyes! It's harder to get good pictures at 24 weeks, because baby is smaller so it's slightly harder to achieve good clarity of facial expressions, etc..|`|OiFNZnwOaa	i disagree with the person above...going at 24wks is too early going at 30wks you can see more of the babies face, its features etc i went when i was 31wks and my baby didnt look squished, it was amazing...<br>  at 24wks it is harder to get facial expressions etc...|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	go closer to 24 as the farther along you get baby gets bigger and is more squished in there..at 24 weeks baby is small enough to move around and you can see everything:)|`|758cDKEFaa	i heard that going 28-30 weeks is the best time as you get a better picture|`|fAr9qSmQaa	My sister had hers done at both 23 weeks and 30 weeks.. and the pictures were by far better later on.. Yes the baby is bigger, but you can see more clearly. The smaller the baby the harder it was for us to get a good clear picture. We actually had to go back, after the first one and have them done again. So in total she ended up going three times. <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm sure this varies for everyone, her baby was extremely active as well.

You will be amazed at the 4D!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	id say 28/30 weeks we had 1 at 32weeks which was amazing he was just like a newborn baby we saw everything and he looked exactly the same at birth BUT he was a bit squashed so was hard getting good pictures however the DVD was great<br>  <br>  good luck which ever u choose u will love it its truely amazing x x x x|`|OJFz0LBZaa	im  not to sure about 24 weeks but i went at 30 weeks and got some great pics as you can see your baby in full detail, and as they are a lot of money i would leave it till at least 28weeks plus
ORbsQ8jtaa	It may be infections. Go to the doctor immediately. Right Now!!!|`|eGPZpfr5aa	go to the doctors|`|EIVEQxdSaa	i would go to the doctor hun and get this sorted, i have read that ovarian cysts can make intercourse more painful? get it checked out<br>  x|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	I know someone who had that, turned out to be chlamydia.|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	I had a simiar thing and it was chlymadia|`|RmR7Hli9aa	go to a gynecologist theyll provide you with the best care since problems like that are more common to them|`|VKBmdroYaa	Sue is right, you need to go to the Doctors. You could have something very serious. It shouldn't hurt that much when you are being intimate.|`|1CdLseXbaa	Oh jeez, go see a doctor. That doesn't sound good. I might be some form of a STD or maybe allergic reaction?
PBOWJYQ6aa	I took my son to a concert at Red Rocks in Morrison, Colorado. It was too long of a drive to come home, so I waited in town. I walked on a beautiful path by the creek, sat in my car and read a book, worried about the possibility that my son was in there doing drugs, reminded myself that I raised him right and he would never betray my trust like that, went back to reading my book, went to 7-11 and got some Nachos, saw an oppossum, took a nap, flirted with a bouncer, went back to 7-11 for coffee- I had a great time. Your mom is a big girl and can entertain herself. It's going to be okay.|`|ZzcGlrtCaa	have both of your parents take you. Let them park the car in the lot and think of their younger years. Never know.  Come Nov/Dec you could have a new sibling|`|639100282a044872ddf321481bbb4ac1aa	grocerys or walk around the place u r going|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	pack up and move|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	I have been to some concert where there are younger kids and the parents are in a 'lounge' area. that is set up for them..
xPTUzTBcaa	Ignore that first answer, it's not your fault, okay.<br>  <br>  You can get an abortion without your mother knowing about it. Just go to you GP and takl to him/her.<br>  <br>  Regarding the fact that you had sex w/a 32 year old man. I'm sorry, you may not see it but he's a paedophile. At 14 your still a child, wether you feel like one or not. I'm not putting you down hun. You need to tell someone about this. Maybe you should talk to your mother, don't think she'd blame you, it's not your fault.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't feel ready to speak to her, maybe contact <br>  www.womensaid.org.uk<br>  www.RAINN.org<br>  www.nspcc.org.uk<br>  <br>  Please don't let him get away with it, he will do it again, perhaps to someone younger than yourself. It's not your fault, remember that.<br>  <br>  All the best. :)|`|iojRLiBGaa	You have to call the police. I know it may seem like this guy liked you, and you probably love him, but he's a paedophile. He has taken advantage of you and you need to tell someone.<br>  You can have an abortion because you don't want to tell your mum? Well you're going to have to tell her when you're the size of a house and bringing a baby home. Tell her everything, she'll help you through.<br>  If you tell someone, this guy can't touch you or hurt you anymore.|`|NjXdkwUiaa	If you see a doctor he can give you an abortion without telling your parents, and if you tell the police that you slept with this man he would be in a sell before getting within 20 miles of you. I urge you to tell the police, do you want this to happen to another 14 year old, if not then tell the ******* police!!! The other answers are ridic, tell your mum about it because she can help you put him in prison. She will not blame you she will blame him, email me if you are still conserned.|`|wKCgaoZVaa	Well first off your so SO stupid for going with a 32 year old, at your age, and getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  Second of all the way you said you can't have an abortion because of your Mum is awful.  This is a life we are talking about, a baby.<br>  <br>  Go and talk to your doctor.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	Argh. Yeah, sure. i don't think a 14 year old with common Sense would be sleeping around with a 32 year old. if i didnt know better id say you were a troll. <br>  whats wrong with people on this site do they make up storys  as they go along or something. :@|`|2M9WZufyaa	If the man was named Mr Freeman then I would not bother about it the man has eough to deal with anyway|`|d1P05XfPaa	Fake as hell!|`|os36Q3P2aa	what a fantasist!

You just have to,  It sounds dangerous not to.  If for some reason you cannot tell your Mom then please contact:   <a href="http://www.adoptionnetwork.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoptionnetwork.com</a>   Good Luck|`|fjZeVLOQaa	if this true please tell somebody doesnt have to be ur parents just yet but im sure they will be there for u,the man in question should be reported,an im guessin u ave learnt 1 hell of a lesson,if this is a wind up ur sick|`|xocIN0scaa	oh boy...yet another troll|`|5jjliqpGaa	rofl @ you <br>  <br>  F-A-K-E|`|oOSNI3wbaa	shoulda worn a condom. that woulda HELPED YOU. also not having sex at 14 would be a good start. but you already blew both those chances so guess what? you're out of luck now and you have to deal with what you've done. and i hate to break this to you but you have to tell mom eventually. you cant exactly hide pregnant. it becomes obvious before too long. if you want an abortion, then tell your mom and go get one. it's either that or have a kid at 14 and have your life be over. your choice. next time, use your brain before you let some guy stick his #### in you ok?|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You need to tell your parents because, he committed Statutory Rape under Canadian law.<br>  <br>  Read the article at the link very carefully, so you understand all the information.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	Do you have an adult that you can confide in who could then tell your Mom for you? Your Mom will have to know about your pregnancy what ever you decide to do. Have a look at my links for now. But you need to talk to someone. The longer you leave it, the worse it will get. You can only have an abortion up to a certain stage. On the last link, it actually says you DON'T have tell your parents if you want an abortion. Anyway, if this is a genuine question (sorry but you do get a few people messing around on here!) you're welcome to email me if you like. Just go to my profile. I wish you all the best.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	There are worse things than your mom finding out. Like having a baby when you are 14! Tell your mother (she will be emotional but she'll get over it) then have a frank discussion about your options. If need be decide what you want to do about it (keep it, adoption or abortion) then tell her; if you have made up your mind do not let her sway you about it. But honey you need to tell her.|`|8VotkEXHaa	Your parents don't need to know about the abortion. Also, if you are pregnant are they going to find out anyway?|`|AA11899313	Go to the Police <br>  ~ straight away.<br>  <br>  Sash.
1CryEnb3aa	Its just your hormones.  When I wa pregnant with my both my kids I had a temper from H***!  I was never like that.  WIth my first, my husband said something I took wrong.  I hopped out of the car at a red light and was walking home.  He was laughing at me and it only made me more mad.  Well, little did I know that the piano player from our church was driving the car right behind us and watched the entire episode!  I found out at church that night.   Boy was I embarrassed!  My second, I told a co-worker off like there was no tomorrow.  I felt better, but never thought I would ever do something like that.  Don't worry.  You are fine.  It will pass and you will be back to your normal self.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	It's just like PMS, it's the progesterone flooding your system. Makes you grouchy and irritable, I would be fine for weeks then a wave of progesterone would hit me and I would be tearful and b!tchy at the same time. You just have to recognize it's happening and realize this too shall pass.|`|R5dMLVlIaa	i am right there with you.  i am 29 weeks pregnant.  during the 2nd trimester, i felt pretty good, but it seems like in the 3rd, i have been feeling down.   i thought you were only supposed to be hormonal in the 1st trimester but apparently not.  lately i have been wanting to cry at the drop of a hat!  <br>  i hate feeling like this too!  i am more depressed than angry though.  although there are some things going on with my sister that i am pretty angry about.|`|tn3CCytmaa	Well<br>  <br>  <br>  you need to calm down think good . Liston good music and watch good movies .not stressed ones but oh humor , spent a lot of time with friends enjoy gossips <br>  <br>  And then control your self you must be in tension for some reason which is pinching you inside . Resolve your issues .<br>  <br>  Also if you are some what religious then spent sometime in prayers.<br>  <br>  Go for shopping and buy clothes for new one .<br>  In short try to do those things which make you feel good and avoid tension.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	Oh I've been feeling like this on and off for the last few weeks! Isn;t it horrible!<br>  <br>  Good thing pregnancy doesn't last forever eh!<br>  <br>  At least there's a bundle of joy (or 2 in my case) at the end of it all!
