I believe that most places have at least one female artist. And if they don't then go somewhere else. So basically, call ahead to see if they do.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ODFn1CiMaa	stephen fowler sucks
g1vxi1cwaa	You go down to the supermarket...You look for toothpaste (it should be in a rectangular container probably made out of cardboard, also there are many brands like colgate....and such) THEN, You pick it up using the fingers in your hands. (Be sure to grip tight or you might drop it) Note: Do not grip it too tight.<br>  Then you go to the register. Put the toothpaste down by releasing your grip. Then Pay for it. And Walk out of the store. (DON'T FORGET YOUR TOOTHPASTE!) And thats how you make toothpaste....
g4DgFGIcaa	yes, that would be correct|`|S4X8zOUoaa	I don't believe states have a specific suffix for URL's.<br>  <br>  .la is for the country Laos, but you don't actually have to be from Laos to use it. Some companies that are based in Los Angeles also use .la.
mDYsr62maa	But, always check the local laws to be sure.  In Texas, you can shoot in rural areas if you have more than 10 acres.  If less, then you would need special permits etc.  Also, be sure you cover yourself by see what is down range and posting notices against trespassing.  I wish I had your problem, but maybe next year.|`|Dbj8pU8haa	You may fire your weapon anywhere outside the city limits.|`|S4X8zOUoaa	Unless it is excessively noisy or disrupts order, it is not illegal to set up a target range where you live.
e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	Chapel Hill is still a good 4 hours away from the closest beach, just so you are aware.<br>  <br>  Emerald Isle and Atlantic Beach are the most popular ones in NC, but Topsail is really nice too.  There aren't many spectacular resorts, but find a nice hotel like the Hilton.  If you wanted something resort-like, I would suggest looking into renting a beach house.<br>  <br>  In Atlantic Beach, my favorite beach front to go to (if you don't have one in front of your hotel, or if you would like to go to a different beach) is definitely Fort Macon.  It's at the end of the island (when you go over the bridge onto the island, you would turn left on the main road... there's really only one) and if anything, it has an interesting old fort you can explore with a reinactment and a cannon shooting every hour or so. <br>  <br>  The Outer Banks, especially Okracoke, is definitely the most sought after vacation beach spot in NC, but the ferry ride adds another 3 hours to your trip.<br>  <br>  If you would like a nice day trip, Bear Island is beautiful, but it is a State Park so no hotels.<br>  <br>  If you end up in Atlantic Beach, I would definitely suggest a day trip to Beaufort.  They have a lot of boat rides that will take you to see wild horses on the nearby islands, or go see Blackbeard's house.  Also, Cape Lookout is a nice day trip from Beaufort as well.  They offer Catamaran rides to there. <br>  <br>  NC recently revamped the Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores, definitely worth a visit.  <br>  <br>  Here is Beaufort's website, which also contains information about surrounding areas and beaches: <a href="http://www.historicbeaufort.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.historicbeaufort.com/</a>|`|39yiT45vaa	Atlantic Beach is really nice!! Its way on the coast but loads of fun....There are a bunch of hotels for check online....But for the best advice....find a local to tell you what the best things to do are!
