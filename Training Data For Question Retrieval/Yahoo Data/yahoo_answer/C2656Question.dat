Minha vizinha adotou um gatinho da rua e estava cuidando dele, ela tem outros gatos que s?o muito bem cuidados, ela toma o maior cuidado p eles n?o saírem na rua, mas esse conseguiu sair,voltou algumas horas depois com a cabecinha achatada e acabou morrendo no quintal dela, ela tem quase certeza q foi um vizinho do lado, pois ele tem passarinho. Gente isso é muita crueldade, se gato vai atrás de passarinho é pq é a natureza dele, ele age por instinto. Mas eu acho q foi crueldade mesmo, pq o bicho era t?o pequeniniho, fiquei chocada!!Por isso meus gatos est?o em viveiro,n?o saem na rua.

20081004035819AA6lBw4	Pets;Horses	What do I wear fox hunting?	I don't want ANY anti-hunting slogans posted on this please...   My question is about what type of jacket I need. I live in Northern Ireland where fox hunting is not banned, and would appreciate any advice from anyone in the UK and Ireland about whether I need to get a tweed or black jacket for hunting. It's my first time next week.   I've been told to get a tweed one for before the season starts and then a black one for the later hunts - is this correct?   Also, I have buff jodhs, long black boots, a shirt and stock - is there anything else I need, as I don't want to get it wrong!   Many thanks!!

I am still at school so can't spend all day with it but I could give it a lot of love and attention. I would like one that doesn't bite a lot and that I can cuddle and play with. I would like one not too hard to look after. I don't want a guinea pig as I have a dog but if I had a small one I could keep in the house I could keep i out of his way. I'm just telling you this so you know I do like rats and mice incase you think one of these could be right for me but then think no as I won't like them      Thanks, Please help, a.s.a.p   Bye.

Je lui mettais à manger sans pouvoir l'approcher. Un jour j'ai décidé de le prendre car il était de + en + perdu et il avait été battu par des enfants. Nous l'avons attrapé avec un filet de pêche et depuis il est à la maison. Il est resté 2 mois terré derrière le canapé je lui donnais à manger. Depuis 2 ans et demi, il mange avec les autres, dort sous le chauffage mais je peux tout juste le caresser car il a toujours peur. J'aimerais le prendre dans mes bras pour lui faire des bisous mais il s'affole alors je n'insiste pas. Qui a déjà eu un chat avec cet handicap, quelle est votre expérience pour l'apprivoiser et lui donner confiance ? Je suis patiente mais toujours impatiente de lui faire partager mon amour car je l'adore.

20090205174947AAPb3UD	Pets;Dogs	Would you continue to take your dog to this vet?	Ok this came in over the raw chat mailing list last night and I am wonder what people here would do in this case. Whether you feed raw or not, diet is the choice of the owner.      "The big kicker is that I got a HUGE lecture about feeding raw. She   printed me off 17 pages from a book Small Animal Clinical Nutrition   and told me I should home cook his food or give him Solid Gold. She   told me that my Calcium/Phosphoreous ratio was wrong and that he is   going to start breaking bones because she had to put down a liter or   grey hound pups that were fed a RAW diet because there bones were   breaking from walking. She also told me he needs carbohydrates   (either from sweet potato or brown rice). She said I was doing him a   HUGE DISERVICE by feeding him this diet and that basically I was   killing him. I took her literature and then complained to my husband   on the way home. I am right in what I am feeding him right? He gets   chicken carcasses, pork ribs, beef, buffalo, deer, beef organs (not   all this in one meal) but as variety. He also gets Salmon Oil. She   told me that she thinks he has an allergy to some kind of food I have   been feeding him and that allergies can pop up overnight. She said I   should put him on one COOKED protein with out bone since dogs who eat bones get constipated. Is this what I should be doing?"      How would handle this? Would you be on the way to a new vet or would just continue to use this vet?      NOW before people unfamiliar with raw go on about how the vet knows better, raw is bad etc etc. Take raw out of the picture and substitute what you feed. How would you like it if you KNEW for a fact your dog was eating healthy and your food of choice was questioned?

I have ridden many morgans before, because I volunteer at a morgan breeding farm, and they need me to school some of their horses.  One of them bucked me off, and then bucked my friend off too.  Then, another one spooked and ran, I didnt fall, but still, it was a small gust of wind.  Augh. Then, this other one was playing follow the leader, and my friend cantered her horse, this was my first time riding that horse, so I didnt canter.  Intentionally, that is.  I didnt fall, but still.  The list goes on.  Any of you feel the same for a different (or same, whatever) breed of horse?   :)

20090205171841AAtbFjP	Pets;Dogs	Neutering at an adult age, negative consequences?	So we recently acquired our 3rd dog-- who was "adopted" (I put in parenthesis because it's a long story).  He was neutered just a few months ago, at the ripe old age of 5.  I met this dog when he was almost 3, and he was a drastically different dog.  He was still intact then.    My question is this:    What are the psychological, emotional, and physical consequences of neutering a dog at such an "old" age.  I have my own opinions on neutering and spaying, so I don't need the sneuter police to convince me it was a good thing, I just need cold hard facts please.
20090205173008AAjvO4i	Pets;Dogs	Drinking from toilet-- how to discourage it?	My dogs have a nasty little habit of drinking from the toilet.  Prior to recently, it hasn't been a really big deal to me, the water here isn't chlorinated or anything, and we don't use any automatic chemicals to clean the toilet, so there's no chance (that I'm aware of) of ingesting something they shouldn't.  Recently though, I've started my dogs on an apple cider vinegar in the water treatment, and it's become a problem to me that they drink from the toilet.  Up until now, I thought that closing the toilet lid would be a fix all, but I just heard one of my dogs in there trying to nose the lid open, and I know it's only a matter of time before they figure that out.  Aside from shutting the door or baby gating the bathroom, are there any other "cures" to this addiction that my dogs have that have been tested, tried, and true?

20090205172035AAfb4lf	Pets;Horses	To wrap, or not to wrap? Any pointers?	I have a new 3/4 year old draftx mare. She is really green, we are just starting her cantering. I want to make this a good experience for her, and for her to be healthy through everything. Should I wrap her legs, or leave them be? We're taking it slow, I'm only working on her cantering once or twice a week so she doesn't get pushed too much. I don't want to overface her. If this horse was older, I'd wrap no matter what, but I don't know if wrapping her this young will have any ill affects on her later in life...

20090205161244AA6HxdM	Pets;Horses	Are polo wraps supportive enough for showjumping?	I ride an OTTB mare; her little legs are pretty tough considering how hard she is on them.  A long time ago I bought some Eskadron gel-tech open front boots, and they're amazing.  But since then she's developed a cold splint on the inside of one of her legs, so I can't put the boots on her or they rub the cold splint.    The only other boots I've got are some old galloping boots that she occasionally wears for turnout and some splint boots, but they're really only protective on the inside.    I ride using polo wraps all the time, and I love how protective they are, but do you all think they are supportive enough for showjumping in the 3'-3'6" level?  If not, do you all know of any soft boots that aren't /super/ expensive?

I got my dog neutured about a month ago, and ever since then I noticed that he doesn't breath as easily as he used to.. this is mostly when he's sleeping though, for example he snores louder and more frequently, and when he's just breathing heavily, it sounds like he has boogers or something.. i don't think it's a cold, cause it's been going for a while now..      what do you think it could be?

20090205170219AAvBX0z	Pets;Dogs	Why is the dog trying to attack the little ones?	I don't want to say MY dog, cause I am the only one in my family that dislikes animals. Anyways, my family just got a pit bull (mixed with another breed...). I think he is around 6 months old....they say he is still a puppy.      So, yesterday and today (happened twice) they let the dog loose. And like any kid, my 2 sisters (8 and 4 yrs.old) were admiring the little thing. They didn't even touch it. The dog suddenly got all agressive and tried to attack them. It was LOUD. The dog didn't do that with the others, at all.      So why did it attack, I mean tried to attack? Another thing, are pit bulls good to have? It's an outside dog, not inside. I apperciate any help, this is their first time having a pet. Figures.

20090205163800AAiSuWH	Pets;Dogs	A quick question about my dog, as well as guessing what his breeds are (pictures)?	This is purely an out-of-curiosity question.    My dog is really needy. I can't go anywhere without him being right there, staring at me. It doesn't really bug me, unless I have an arm full of something and he gets underfoot.    He's a crossbreed, my baby, and if I let him, would get away with murder. For added fun, I'll include a picture so you can try to guess what he is, if you don't already know (it's easy). I'll let you know when someone guesses what the shelter told us he is.     My question is: Which one of his breeds shows this trait?    Baci (pronounced Bah-tchee)    http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s293/...    http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s293/...    http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s293/...    http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s293/...    http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s293/...    http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s293/...

Hey guys; I have a question, I dont think there is something seriously wrong, Im just interested.      Well I have had my chinchilla for about a month. She is a black velvet named Tia, she is about 3 months old. Her cage is in my room. She never runs on her chin-spin (wheel) duing the day, but at night, she runs on it like crazy! Anyways, its really weird... when I turn the light on in my room, she stops running and just sits there like she wasn't on her wheel before, then when I turn the light off she starts running on it again. I noticed it and tried it several times, and she still does it! I was just wondering why she might do this. Thanks!

20090205163040AAmSwoW	Pets;Cats	Help! My cats are recovering from surgery and are acting very strange!!!?	My cats are home from their surgery that was on tuesday. Tabby is acting fine, just not eating and drinking like she usually does. She also didnt quite make it to the litter box today. Pheobe has to wear an e-collar so she doesnt pull out her staples, which she had to have fixed today. She is also barely eating and drinking and she has not even tried to used the litter box. I don't see that they have urinated much at all. Both were declawed. Pheobe was spayed as well. Could this be a major issue or just side effects from being put under? When should I be concerned? How do I know if they are eating and drinking enough and why are they not going to the bathroom? PLEASE HELP!!!!

20090205163835AAZ4STd	Pets;Cats	I am wondering what may be wrong with this cat's eye?	Hi all.  Ok...I have this stray/feral I take care of and ask about him here often!  What a tough little kitty.  Surviving below zero weather.  I have made shelters for him and luckily he goes in them and stays here pretty much 24-7.  He now lets me pet him and he rubs my legs and purrs.  I have an indoor cat.  I am off track now though!  The other day, one of his eyes was all watery.  He also had strands of hair matted under his chin that day so I think he got into something.  (Later on the hair was gone...cleaned.)    (This other lady that takes care of him...she and I think there is a 3rd person taking care of him as sometimes he is so dirty and stuff and then appears all clean and neat.  Did he do that himself?)  The next day it was heavier, and in the morning because it was so cold, looked like it was frozen shut.  Which may have been a good thing.  This a.m., it is all dry, his eye is open and he looks better.  I got to get a better look at it today and there is a bump above his eye.  Maybe there is something in it???  IDK.  Please do not say bring him inside as I cannot.  If you think I should take him to a vet or TNR/shelter...you can say so but I might not do that.  So I need to know if there are other options.  Looking for your opinions.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!

20090205170526AATcXWg	Pets;Cats	New boyfriend and attack kitten at night?	I have a kitten who's very bonded to me(I bottle fed her and work from home so she's usually with or on me). She thinks I'm her mother and I suppose I encourage that behavior. She's very sweet with me and has never bit, clawed or hissed at me. She even lets me trim her claws with out(much) complaint.      My last boyfriend was HORRIBLY abusive to her. He'd fling her about by her tail, hold her under water  and drop her off the balcony. He is no longer in her- or my- life.       I do however have a new  boyfriend. Ian would never hurt her and is just as gentle with her as I am. He feds her, pets her and loves her without any problem from her. She'll even bring her toys back to him for another throw. Yes, my kitten plays fetch.       Its at night when there's a problem. Ian and I live together and therefor sleep in the same bed. My kitten, Slyvanas, will only sleep if she's in bed with me. Its slightly annoying but its cute. Whats not cute however is how if Ian lies down without me in the bed.....she'll attack him! She pounces on him and claws at him until he gets up and gets me to go to bed with him. Then there's no problem. She'll sleep happily between us-unless I need to get up.      I'm sure this behavior has sometime to do with the abuse and I'm hoping I can fix this somehow. Ian would never hurt her and he'd never hurt me. I think she believes she's protecting me and I wish I knew how to make her trust Ian.

20090205173446AAcqPsm	Pets;Dogs	Can a male dog breed twice in one day?	I have a female Aussie 1 yr old in first heat (too young to breed!) but she escaped the house and I found her in with my male Aussie. I am very worried that they breed.  They have both been desperately trying to get at each other. When I found them together, I watched them to see if he was still trying to get at her, but he was just laying there panting heavily. She was  very willing and flagging at him but he just ignored her. So I separated them  for about an hour then let her near him just to see if he was still excited by her, as he had been. He just ignored her efforts.  So i waited an hour observed them again but this time he tried, and I removed her immediately do you think they bred?  Can a male do it more than once and will a female want it more than once right away? maybe he tried and kept missing the mark till he was tired? I am planning on having them fixed but must wait till she is out of heat. ( had considered getting one litter before fixing  as they are both of champion lines). Also heard that the morning after pill has side effects.  is there a pregnancy test other than x ray? or ultrasound?  Thanks

I have a red ear slider about Two years old, and everytime i change his water I notice he will stay in the tank swimming, eating, basking under the uv light, and then he'll dig himself a hole, in the rocks and bury himself and stay there for 2 days or more...the only way he comes out is if I take him out, why does he do this?       he's been doing it for about a year, i havent notice any change in appearance....his shell is hard, but i noticed a dry patch....      is it normal for him to stay "sleeping" for such a long period of time....   oh and when I take him out, he'll eat, and bask, as if nothing is wrong...

I was told she was 2 1/2 years when I got and I have had her for about 6 months so she's about 3 years old but when I took her to the vet and I told her her age, she said that "she has aged for 2 1/2 years" so i'm thinking she's actually older than 3. Right now she measures 31 inches from her nose to the tip of her tail. Her tail alone measures 21 inches and her body is about 10 inches.       http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u241/...        http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u241/...

I've had him for about 6 months now. He still wakes me up to take him outside.      I sleep about 8 hours, and he does go to outside right before I go to bed. He wakes up 2 hours before I get up, and he whines, and whines, and whines. I can ignore him, and it goes on for hours. I can tell him to "shhhhh" or "BE QUIET" a million times, and it won't help. Eventually I just get up, take him outside, and then I'm awake for the rest of the night.      How can I stop this? I KNOW he is capable of holding it, because he sometimes has to hold it 8 hours, on days, where I don't get home to take him out.      I do crate train him.

20090203061110AAXWDEc	Pets;Dogs	Field trial & other performance event people is this true?	AKC just revamped the lure coursing rules and to the dismay of many long time exhibitors they have removed the dismissal - a dog can go out &  spend the entire time harassing the others dogs and then go out the next week & do it again! There is no rule forcing the owner to remove  the dog from competition even for a short time for retraining even after repeat offenses. AKC strongly opposes the universal cry by long time coursing folks saying none of their OTHER events has a such a penitently - so really what happens if a pointing trial dog doesn't look for birds just harasses the other dogs? I seem to recall that an obedience dog can be banned if it repeatedly makes trouble in the group exercises - why is this different?

My horse is a medium/regular tree and a 31cm in Prestige saddles. A 31cm Prestige is considered narrow/medium and a 31cm Stubben is considered wide, so what size should I get?      -My TB has very big withers; how are Stubben saddles for horses with a big wither? Do they tend to pinch? Are they cut back enough?      -I've seen their Juventus S in black, but with a light brown underside, can you get it in all black?      -Also, if this doesn't fit my horse, I'll need to sell it; are Stubben saddles still selling pretty well in the current state of the economy?       Thanks!

20090205182702AA6F19H	Pets;Fish	Why aren't my Zebra Danios swimming together?	I have 4 Zebra Danios that do not swim together the majority of the time. They mostly swim around solo and toward the bottom of the tank instead of the middle or top. I have a 20 gallon tank with plenty of room in the middle and the front of the tank for them to swim. They share their tank with 4 MM Platies.       Once in a while a few of them swim together, but they are rarely all 4 in the same place. I thought they were supposed to school, what gives?
20090205181746AAWkL63	Pets;Dogs	Housebreaking a puppy, ready to  give in?	First puppy for me, ever. I am a working mom, M-F. Dog trainer told me that was OK, just to crate train. Supposedly puppies won't pee where they sleep? She does. First thing in the morning, outside. When home from work, outside. In fact, today it was nice weather so I kept her out 35 minutes or so. BUT, she will do her business outside, then after letting her in, she will pee or poop (right in front of me) 5-10 minutes after being in. I jsut don't get it. I don't know what I am doing wrong. I do the "No!" and put her out after. It does not work, she will still continue to do this. We have been housebreaking 3.5 weeks. She is 10.5 weeks old. I need some serious help. I am starting to think that she will never be trained. I am thinking the trainer was wrong and a puppy is too hard for a busy family to train. Is there anything I am doing wrong? Please tell me something I have not tried already. I know puppies are babies that are learning, but she is just not getting it, so I must not be doing it right. I rent a house, and just can not have the carpets ruined. I am at a loss......

What should I do?
20090205182648AAftlCR	Pets;Dogs	Help me train my dog not to try to bite/growl at my brother???? Please??? I LOVE MY PUPPY TOO MUCH!?	I just got a male puppy (8 months) named Pippet about 3 days ago. He is such a sweetie pue! I love him so much! The only problem is that he is aggresive towards my little brother. He has tried to bite him twice (didn't suceed thank goodness) and has growled at him. He does prefer women more than men, but he loves my dad. My brother tries petting him and rubbing his belly and giving him treats but nothing seems to work too well. Have any tips? Please help! I don't want to send Pippit back to the shelter because we love him dearly. With a little training, he will be fine, right???

20090203062959AAmRNpl	Pets;Horses	Which trainer to believe?	I have 2 Arabians. I was hiring one trainer when she hurt her back and was out of commission for 2 months. I hired another once it looked like she would not be coming back for a while.       The first trainer noticed my 8 year old grey mare wore her front hooves down on the inside of each instead of wearing them down evenly. She watched her lunge and said she would benefit from wearing sports boots while training.      Now 2 months later, the second trainer looked and said the mare was starting to deform the cannon on the front right leg from the hooves wearing unevenly and she won't be able to take any stress on her or she will have more damage. She said there is just a little fluid on the knee now. She suggested that the farrier put a "pad" on her hooves.      The vet saw her in August and saw no problems and neither has the 2 farriers that have seen her. I've called the farrier back who saw her in August to see if he sees any difference in her. He will be here Friday.      My question is with so many people having different opinions, who do I go with? My concern is a rider's weight may be too much if she is not very sound. I start riding lessons on my other mare next month (she is currently getting 30 days training to brush up her manners and cues) and the trainer will then switch to the grey mare.      I trust the first farrier to do what needs to be done. He knows Arabians and has a very good reputation. But who do I trust in the long run? The vet who sees no problems, the trainer who says sports boots, or the trainer who worries that the cannon is deforming from stress? I am a larger rider and do not want to hurt her or make her worse.       P.S. The vet said in August that she could carry me with no problems. I am not going to do competition riding just hacking out.
20090203063211AAQw9n1	Pets;Dogs	Getting rid of worms in puppies?	I just noticed that my dog was scooting her butt across the floor and leaving, yes, worms behind.  First of all, I'm completely shocked because I she just went to the vet on Friday and her stool sample was negative.  How can they pop up so quickly?      Anyway, I went to WalMart and grabbed a bottle of Hartz liquid stuff and gave her a teaspoon.  (She's a little thing.  4-5 pounds.)  I now read that Hartz is pretty worthless.  Should I wait and see what happens or should I call the vet (again)?      I don't want the poor thing to have to deal with the worms, but I don't want to make her sick with more medicine OR pay for another visit to the vet when she was given a clean bill of health four days ago!      (And yes, from now on I will certainly not treat her with over-the-counter medication.  I love my dog!)
20090203063841AAc89bw	Pets;Horses	Strong Horse.....Help!?	When im leading my 15hh chestnut gelding (TB x Arab x Welsh) he gets really strong and heads for the grass or food.He shoves me up against the hedge or like the other day I turned him around (whilst still having his tack on) and he stuck his nose out and pushed m into the wall and I had to jump over a bucket with a load of scoop forks in.I've tried a controller head collar,a halter,his bridle,a chain around his nose,the lead rope round his nose and he only,well most of the time leads in a chifney.Im 13 and my dad lives and a half hours away and my mum is scared of him because of what he does,Im moving him in march to my own stables because it costs so much, we cant afford a trainer at the moment but we have a sand school till the end of march.I am aware of when hes going to do but theres just no way of stopping him, he rears, if you hold onto him while hes trying to get away he kicks out, he kicks if you whip him and the only way you can get him back is by bribing him with food.   Is there anything else I could try or a training program to get him back to a normal head collar and what should I do after he gets away when I catch him again because words don't work and if you tell him to do something o hit him(not hard) he practically runs over you! please help!

20090205183341AAXjCwt	Pets;Horses	Do you think I should ride again?	So about a two and a half years ago I bought a horse and was really into horseback riding and helping out at my stable.  But after about half a year my interests started changing and I no longer wanted to go to the barn anymore which led to selling my horse back to the owner because she wasn't getting the care and attention she needed.  I have never rode or gone back to the stable since that day.  But now, I am really starting to miss it and I am thinking about riding again but I am afraid that I will not be accepted there because everyone will dislike me for not paying enough attention to my horse and not even visiting her after I sold her (don't get me wrong I really loved her and I feel incredibly guilty for selling her back).        So what do you think, should I go back to the stable I rode at and where the horse I owned is at?

20090205190140AAVEgdo	Pets;Cats	Cats wont stop peeing on my bed!!?	I have, this is gonna make me sound crazy but, 6 cats. Every so often one of them, not always the same one, will pee on my bed. They are all healthy and happy, we keep their litter clean, scooped almost daily but that doesn't seem to have any bearance as to when they pee on the bed, as they will sometimes pee on it right after we put new litter in the box, but not always. Anyway it seems to be random, and for no apparent reason. I have tried to put news paper, plastic sheeting, and tin foil on the bed, the only thing this did was attract them ("Ooo, it makes noise, JUMP ON IT!!). So now I've got this idea that maybe if I can find a smell that doesn't bother me or my fiance, but that they hate, I can spray it on the bed and they'll stay away. But I cant think of any smells that cats don't like, to try. So my question is, what are some smells that cats really, really don't like, that either don't smell bad or don't smell at all to humans?
