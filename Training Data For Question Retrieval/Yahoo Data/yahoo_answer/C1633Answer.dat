Z2w4YCiyaa	They do have a small stand in the mall its not much of a store. Its about the size of any stand in the mall. You can go to the Amway Arena and buy plenty different magic items and even the same thing they have at the store also you can go online to OrlandoMagic.com.|`|Aw6nZ4wWaa	no but i'v heard of it|`|qDrctkHSaa	They have a small booth just outside Macy's at the Florida mall. Don't believe they have a store inside the Amway arena.
zyUfLvF5aa	It really depends on the hidden mickey. Some are very easy to find, while others can be very hard, such as the one in the picture. It really varies. There are millions of hidden mickeys throughout the parks, and everything else in Disney World, look everywhere, they can also be in resorts! I hope you have a great time looking for these little mickeys.|`|2q1XI0j9aa	it depends on where you are at. They are easy to spot in its a small world. you can find the answers somewhere and check yourself, but IDR where...|`|WUnEENDQaa	I've found one today! When you go to Epcot, go into the Mexico country. Then go on the attraction featuring the Three Caballeros. Towards the end of the ride there is a small float saying 'Viva Donald', and a hidden Mickey is in there. Towards the bottom right of the float, there is 3 small drums that represent Mickey. The 2 small drums for the ears, and then another small drum for the head. That's the only hidden Mickey I've found!|`|kJdpjLKeaa	There are some that are straight out, but some that are really hidden. I like to have a little list so when I go to the parks, I can easily spot one. For instance, if you go into the Haunted Mansion, during the ballscene look at the table, there is a hidden Mickie built from plates.|`|siBUbTdyaa	<a href="http://www.hiddenmickeys.com/HiddenMickeyParks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hiddenmickeys.com/HiddenMicke...</a>|`|Aw6nZ4wWaa	It's not hard but there are millions at Magic Kingdom.It's not hard at all!

URZNtrxsaa	Hi Melissa,<br>  Besides the obvious fact that Boca sits along the coast next to the beaches and the ocean, I will tell you that we have no where near the number of retired seniors that exist in Florida. At one time yes. However, Phoenix and the Valley of the Sun now has a population of over 3,000,000 people, with Phoenix the 5th largest city in the US.<br>  That said, we do have lots of sand to share with you and lots of Midwesterners that visit here both as snowbirds, and ones like me that escaped the cold 15 years ago and love it here. In addition to all the Valley has to offer you, we have some of the most beautiful scenery in the country. You can snow ski and water ski here in the spring months if you are so inclined. During the summers, you can escape to Flagstaff or the Rim country up north and see temps plummet at night into the upper 40's, while the Valley sizzles.<br>  Or, you can head for California, only a 4 to 5 hour drive way and enjoy the SoCal beaches...<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision|`|4ccfa336e8d721730deaa2e0cdead710aa	Yeah it isn't that cold in the winter. Other than that nope.

oNh9Av4aaa	well what i would do is get a bank account and every time you babysit put about half in it and the other half you can spend as you like after a little while your savings will really add up well i hope this helps <br>  ~Ally|`|nQS78Vibaa	You are just 13 so I wouldn't worry too much about saving now. If your parents are giving you money to the mall then they are giving you an allowance. Once you get older and get a gross amount of money in one pay check put 10% back of that check into a savings account and don't think about it....and before you know it you will have quit a chunk of change saved.|`|2AAo6Xr7aa	Try to save it keep it inside a wallet and think that you should save it for something you might want in the future or just tell your mom to help you save a certain amount.|`|OEaBSuaWaa	Give it right to your parents.  Put it in a piggy bank that doesn't open.  Put it in the bank. Lock it up!|`|AA12340290	if u need 2 start saving, then just strt saving........|`|hKVh1EIcaa	hhmmm...|`|AcFBETxAaa	Sure had better save up some money and get a tent and supplies. Grandpa said all hell is just around the corner and everything will shut down and everybody gonna be fighting. Sounds like civil war and big trouble. Good idea to be saving but if it gets too bad them dollars won't be much good. Need other things to stay alive, I reckon. Grandpa is taking us to the country and wait it out.

Since it is free valet parking you can tip accordingly.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	Its either self or valet, if your in a hurry and dont mind tipping the extra $2-$5 i would go valet to get you in and out and you dont have to put up with walking and looking for you car like i do in vegas haha..|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	the parking is FREE  but my hand to GOD, my friend had his car stolen from WYNN parking on Tuesday....the criminals know that the hotels have cut back on security to save money   SO BEWARE  LAS VEGAS is in the hands of the thieves right now...BEWARE  use all security devices to protect your property...and watch yourself walking around especially in these poorly lit parking lots|`|NHEhUOv9aa	Parking in vegas is free and valet is free too...All u gotta do is tip and not very much either.....I recommend valet for sure....u walk rite in and when u want to leave u walk rite out...Its that easy....Very convenient.....Sometimes by 11ish or 12ish at nite valet is full so be careful bout that.....|`|AA10240904	Self parking is free unless you valet then you give the valet at least $2 when you pick up the car|`|XwXuJIF8aa	Free and usually you should tip the valley $5.|`|XvBPAFqOaa	I used to love tourist like you.

JLA2Wncfaa	I have stayed in a celbrity spa suite at MGM and a Pyramid spa at Luxor neither are recently refurbed but both are nice I think that the room at Luxor was nicer with the tub in the window and becasue of the slanted walls you can see the sky and the strip or mountain, but the resort at the MGM is nicer. <br>  <a href="http://vegasuncovered.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/mgm-grand-las-vegas-my-review/" rel="nofollow">http://vegasuncovered.wordpress.com/2009...</a><br>  <a href="http://vegasuncovered.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/luxor-one-of-the-best-value-budget-hotels-in-las-vegas/" rel="nofollow">http://vegasuncovered.wordpress.com/2008...</a>|`|AA11114814	I stayed in a spa suite at the Luxor in 2001.

dd3gCaNHaa	personally, i think you answered your own question...saudis are just like all other people...some are good, some are bad and some are just plain sick. the fact that the saudi society including officials in the government found these scandals extremely shocking and condemned it so strongly and fought it as they continue to do so proves that the majority of saudi society are decent people that fear Allah and follow islamic conduct and saudi customs and morals.<br>  in the last few years, any thing against saudi arabia seemed to get more publicity than necessary...it became a fad. any twisted pathetic sick soul that wanted to have it's 5 min of fame, play a prank or just contribute in distorting and destroying the image of what "saudi arabia"  is and how its people are suddenly realized that all technologies could serve them and their purpose and it's way too easy not to mention the sheer numbers of people all around the world that they could reach at virtually no cost or effort...<br>  i am a muslim saudi woman...i am a daughter, sister, wife and mother...i have been and still am and by god always will be proud to be saudi. May allah help us fight corruption and aid the sick to heal whatever it was that lead them into the darkness and caused them to be full of rage & destruction taking it out on everyone...may allah help us guide them back to the righteous path so they could become once again decent productive proud muslims and saudis...<br>  as for people from around the world: hope one day you'll see the saudi that i know, love, adore and belong to.|`|Ul8jifyuaa	i had lived in saudi since 1980 till 1989, all what you said was happened and a lot, but the Saudi regime can hide all of this, but now with the Development of the world saudi regime couldn't hide it any more|`|nzwYJbEFaa	just try to keeps urs switched off!<br>  w/o blue tooth your left out on alot of good tech and cool stuff your just looking in the wrong places|`|wbJXqkVGaa	How dare you!?!

3zl6DrjVaa	Camp  rim rock is Great
J08K6Fqeaa	It will be hot and muggy, and thunderstorms often flare up in the afternoons. If you can handle this, then by all means, go!<br>  <br>  According you yourfirstvisit.net, The week you are planning for is an average time to visit. The crowds aren't terrible since many schools are back in session. It loses appeal because of being hurricane season.<br>  <br>  However, whenever you plan to go, here's the best tip anyone can give you:<br>  <br>  Go buy "The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2009". This was the best $20 I spent for my family's July 2008 vacation to Disney. The book contains reviews for restaurants, hotels, and attractions on and off Disney property. However, the best part of the book are the touring plans! The plans give you step by step instructions on where to go and when to go in order to avoid the longest lines.<br>  <br>  For example: "Soarin" in EPCOT is one of the most popular rides in all of Disney. A 2-hour wait in line is not uncommon to partake in this awesome experience. However, using the touring plan in the book and maximizing Disney's "Fast Pass" system, we were able to ride it twice in a row without waiting in line one time!<br>  <br>  By the way, if you don't know what the "Fast Pass" system is, then definitely get the book or ask us that are in the know at yahooanswers. It's fast, easy, and one of the few FREE things in Disney. Yes, it is absolutely FREE!<br>  <br>  Go out and buy the book today. I promise you will not be disappointed.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|l6yHfjBNaa	No it's not crazy. I've pretty much always went to the Orlando parks in the summer, and it's fine. Just have patience!! HA HA.. Easier said than done.<br>  <br>  I would suggest going to Universal Studios/Island of Adventure if you're afriad of long lines. They have a thing "The Front of the Line Pass" I think it's called. Of course you have to pay for it, but it's worth it! You go to a seperate line and you get on the ride very quickly. Something to note about this is that you can only use this pass once for each ride, so say you want to go on a ride for a second time, you would have to go in the regular line. <br>  <br>  Hope I've helped!<br>  <br>  L8r!|`|JMVkZJzUaa	Not crazy at all.  Some schools start back in August, so lines are somewhat shorter, but the parks still keep longer hours, there are lots of nightly fireworks shows.<br>  <br>  I have gone a couple of times in August, and it's my favorite time of the year to go. Ya gotta like hot weather, though|`|vZaLptZWaa	It will be hot!!!!|`|d2635e5d3253618c3db1335b418bad59aa	Don't let them fool you, Disney is packed around Labor Day, which is near the begining of September.  People will be trying to fit in that last vacation before school starts and might try to take on a few extra days at the end of August.  My husband and I go every year in August and run into that.  Yes, the end of August is less crowded than the begining.  But August is still a busy month neverless.  <br>  <br>  I would say you should be ok for the 17-22nd.  I wouldn't go later than that though due to Labor day.<br>  <br>  It will be hot, but you will survive.  Just wear something cool and drink lots of water while you're there.|`|kJdpjLKeaa	I am planning to go in September, but I have heard that it is REALLY hot in August in Flordia, but I heard that the lines are shorter and that some children go to school around that time, so there will be less crowds.|`|7SWu8UTeaa	a lot of people dont go in august becuase school starts and it is hot out.  I think you would be fine in the heat.|`|3eRDHl4Saa	It will be hot! If you enjoy hot weather, then you'll be fine. If not, it will be horrible because you have to wait in lines outside for many of the rides. And you have to walk around big parks. I love the hot weather and I love Disney so the combination is great! The temperature can vary from the low-70s to high-90s.<br>  <br>  The lines are definitely shorter. A lot of people don't have the guts to go to Florida during that time of year. Also, students are going off to college or regular school so that helps. If I go in August, I usually leave around the 19th or so and get back around the 26th, so you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	A lot of schools down south go back to school in August, so you may be alright going 17-22.

You can definitely live frugallyon $9/hr here but it depends on your lifestyle and your expectations.<br>  <br>  If you need to check out the current gas prices. Use downtown zip code 33602 and go to like gasbuddy.com or something similar. if you want to know about housing prices.  Check online at Rent.com or Apartment guide. or the newspapers ads at tbo.com<br>  <br>  Also check the newspaper for current crime article and such. Sometimes the best places to live cheaply are near USF.  It does tend to depend on WHERE near USF.  But you can find cheap and somewhat decent housing there.  Some student housing, you must hafe a co-signer NO Matter your credit and some not.  But check Boardwalk at Morris Bridge and similar places at apartment rental sites.<br>  <br>  The price of groceries. Use that same zip and check sales weekly ads at winn dixie.com , publix, sweetbay; also check save-a-lot and we have aldi here.

dbf481897e1a3a28a794979826f7b24eaa	Actually do you know that it's easier to learn and understand math and science in English? <br>  <br>  I was Malay educated up to Form 5. Took my A-levels after that and Math and Sciences (Physics, Chemistry and Biology) was so much easier to understand. <br>  <br>  Besides that, there are lots of information online and they are all in English. I don't find any reason not to teach Math and Science in English. <br>  <br>  You will be surprised that malay kids nowadays speak english all the time and some even speak it at home. I have a few malay friends who speak english with their kids. So, do you think that they cant cope with the language? Kids are really smart, and they can learn really fast, if given the chance. <br>  <br>  I dont think it's easier to command the basic knowledge of Math and Science using the mother tongue first because what you are learning are just translation of knowledge from English to Malay. And wait a minute, not every student's mother tongue is Malay. My mother tongue is Chinese, so... if you want to talk about mother tongue.. it will be another story and another question.|`|9C0thBTzaa	Because Maths and Science is easier in English<br>  what is the point of learning both subjects in Bm, then in english? You expect full translation? its nt possible that way, learning in primary will build better foundation and good command of english usage, hence enhanced students learning esp sc and maths in secondary..<br>  imagine the struggle of using learning in english after all you have learnt is in malay..plus, very much needed books is mostly printed in english, if wanted to study in bm, thus translation need to be done, and we;re wasting more money to republish those books again where we can actually understand them better, in english, yet, english is definitely tough to learn, but nt impossible, if all of us learn the language frm young, sure there would be no problem, its juz a matter of attitude and how we approach the language,as a matter of fact its juz a language, where singaporean and may countries can learn them, why not malaysians? show them Malaysia Boleh!|`|5e6836dfa778c1efeee10f87746767f4aa	after yesterday protest they are going to change back to Malay|`|5c873097b4af9f2a2cc6aeb0288d4ff5aa	cos it was like that in 1969 when i was in darjah satu.......lol|`|omjahgaBaa	Why Malaysian Government insists on using English for math and science?<br>  <br>  This is because the whole world uses the language as an information and/or technology language.

xmulMOYraa	Yes there are casinos, they have some in cripple creek and some in Black Hawk and Central city. I actually work at a casino and some of them up the mountain are really nice. They just voted on amendment 50 and the stakes have now been raised from $5 to $100 max beat. Most of the casino have poker and BJ tables and the slot machines.

V7lGsaR8aa	The three hotels i found the best are as follows . Hotel Rex 1 Le Quy Don Street . Palace Hotel 1 Nguyen Trai Street . Petro House 63 Tran Hung Dao Street .<br>  These three hotels are in the city centre all close to all the facilities you would need , between the 3 i always preferred the Rex as there was always a few people round the bar/pool area . The area is pretty lively on a night with plenty of "girlie bars" if that's your scene . These hotels can all be booked online.<br>  These 3 hotels are on what is known as front beach which is not the best of beaches . Back beach is only a very short cheap Taxi ride away if you are wanting time on the beach(the hotels there are not as good).

OkIN1DCZaa	Hey there mate!<br>  <br>  There is lots of stuff to see in Sydney!!<br>  <br>  There is Luna Park where you have to go on a ship to get there.<br>  <br>  Go to Darling Harbour! There is the aquarium, and the wildlife zoo! You could also go have a little walk in the park and watch a 3D movie at Imax! You could also go on the monorail, and the powerhouse museum here you could be pretending to be doing something!<br>  <br>  You could go walk on the Sydney Harbour bridge as well! Go on the Sydney sight viewing bus and go to the top for the best views ever!! You will have 2 hours on the bus and when you finish, it feels like you'll never get lost!<br>  <br>  Go on the aqua duck, where it is a boat on wheels! It is a duck that has wheels that drive around and could even go on water! I think it is 2 hours on an aqua duck.<br>  <br>  There is heaps of hotels to go to! <br>  <br>  Restaurants? There are plenty!<br>  <br>  Tip: Make sure you have enough money before you go to Sydney. <br>  <br>  Have a great time!!<br>  Lesley|`|hT7BhNamaa	Matzahwo, I am a traveller also, I am in Canada, and so far have been there 4 times with trip number 5 being planned.<br>  <br>  Shopping, look at the more boutique specialty, usually run by the mom and dad types. Keep away from the ones with the big flashing lights and Souveniers advertised.<br>  <br>  I was introduced to a number of places. Night life at the Rocks in Sydney is great, okay I am a mere male, but the girls go there also. The Irish style pubs I found from Thursday night on you can barely get in, if you don't get there early and the atmosphere is great.<br>  <br>  You want to see the harbor, I went on a dinner Cruise on the John Cadman Floating Restaurant. For information I hope I spell this right, you go to Jetty No.6 Circular Quay ferry wharves not far from the Opera House.<br>  <br>  Food, I happen to stumble on a couple of places, thanks to the cabbies over there, I mentioned food, and he took me to this place not far from the CBD called South Sydney Juniors, it's some sort of Football Club or something. I have seen buffets, but this place and a couple of others I was taken to take the icing, cherry off the cake so to speak, my god the food was so good.<br>  <br>  I happen to have the name of another place I went to, they call it the RSL, or Returned Services League, I went to one called Canterbury Hurlstone Park, hope that is right, I am sure one of the locals will correct me.<br>  <br>  These clubs you have to be a member, but the doorman will give you a temporary card for the night just show them your passport that your a visitor. I am not sure if you can go and use the slots.<br>  <br>  I went to what they call the outer south western suburbs, to this club called Club Marconi, another football club, my god it was fun, and the food....wow.<br>  <br>  Hope I have given enough to cover your question, and I'm not a local lol.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Shop at the designer stores in Paddington or the factory outlets at Homebush . kings Cross is the place for night clubs careful though some are known to be a bit sleazy.<br>   Plenty of eating places around darling Harbour although really where ever you turn you won't be far from an eating place or go for a ferry ride to Manly for a meal or out to Bondi beach or China Town There's plenty of time to relax at the beaches|`|9KDE7v7Haa	Hop on the sight seeing bus, get on the roof and within 2 hours you'll see all the best view. Get on Sydney tower to eat or sky walk, climb the Harbor bridge (you have to be sober for this). Relax at Bondi beach, or for somewhere quiet go to the northern beaches. Shop at Oxford street, Paddington, the best shopping in Sydney. Visit the Ivy, staffs there are excellent and sexy. Party goes best around Bondi, Darling Harbor and The Rocks, they're wild around Darlinghurst and King Cross.|`|yULnOJUwaa	Hello mate!<br>  Go to a local library and check out travel books like Frommers that give advice about destinations.

3IJNTuTnaa	It's pretty bad.  McArthur Park is probably one of the most dangerous spots in Los Angeles after dark.<br>  <br>  That said... you might actually be okay, if you stayed away from the park, and if you weren't, y'know, wandering the streets after dark.  But don't get me wrong.  It's still a really crap neighborhood.|`|68fabd3b833fc008897646f2a6b1dac6aa	I think many of the previous posts are still thinking of the MacArthur Park of the 80s and early 90s. Don't get me wrong the area is still pretty nasty, but remember in many parts of LA, the color of your skin doesn't matter, if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time you could get in trouble. Some areas around there are not too bad, but it is true that MS 13 has a heavy influence in that area. If you were to live in that area, I would suggest to try to live a little further north from MacArthur Park or a little more east towards downtown LA.|`|0VtxM72gaa	Well, there was a shooting there on witmer st:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/02/long-time-stree.html" rel="nofollow">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/20...</a><br>  <br>  I've been there during the day and it seemed ok, but it's not somewhere that I'd want to be after dark.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	No matter what you are (trust me, Caucasians aren't exactly the prize of mugging anyway), MacArthur Park is home of the most dangerous gang in North American, the Mala Salvatrucha.  Look it up online, no one in their right mind lives there, only poor immigrants that are terrified every day and night.<br>  <br>  BTW, Westlake is a street there, not a neighborhood.  If you say neighborhood, people are going to think you're talking about Westlake Village, the city.  Nobody calls that Westlake, it's called MacArthur Park.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	It's not about the color of your skin. Macarthur Park is dangerous, regardless of skin color or language spoken. Some of those old apartments have nice architecture, but there is still a lot of crime in the area. You might be able to find an OK spot nearby, but still you need to be careful.

Even if the Arabs unified African tribes into countries they brought with them an identity crisis that still felt in the African countries. And since the Arabs are not an agriculture society, when they arrived to North Africa or Africa where Agriculture was the main source of income, they didn't encourage this activity and they encouraged commerce, because that was their main activity, so the Arabs got richer and the autoctons got poorer.<br>  <br>  Than we'll have to talk about the end of the Andalus empire and what supposed to north Africa and Middle Africa commerce.<br>  <br>  <br>  After what we arrive to the European colonization: Europeans went straight ahead to the economical colonization, and used all the resources that a country needs to build a strong economy, the resistance to get the European out Africa consumed a lot of human and economical potential.<br>  <br>  Once the those countries kicked out the occupation this once still managed to put in the power people who will give her economical advantage in each country.<br>  <br>  In order to stay in control, those political leaders manages to do everything they can to rise a generation where analphabetism is over 64%... do you think with this percentage you can make a rich country?|`|vITZgKthaa	i think because many in the government are corrupted and they want to keep the money to themselves and that's why you see many poor people with diseases in Africa ..because they don't have the money to built up hospitals or any human health centers<br>  <br>  and from there it adds up to a country crisis <br>  <br>  ...you can also see that many people from Africa immigrating to many european countries like France,Spain, Great Britain to have a better life <br>  <br>  I hope this Helps|`|6uQh4VSpaa	If you really want a good answer, check out "The End of Poverty" by Jeffrey Sachs.

ZRG7wEf9aa	You don't have to, but there are reasons why your friend was asked to.  El Al has the best security on the planet, hands down.  They are so through that it takes time to screen every bag.  By delivering your bags the day before, they can have it screened and on the flight in plenty of time.  This is only a request, not a requirement at this time.  Your friend must check their bags two and one quarter hours before the flight departure. In Tel Aviv, there is a new service where two El Al employees will come to you and do your security check, and take your luggage to the airport anywhere from 6 to 24 hours before your flight.  There is a $49 charge for this.

I have seen a few sites and there are quite a few Firenze's in Italy but its not a hugely popular name.<br>  This site is in Italian but where there is blue that's where the surname is more popular, which you'll see is around the Tuscan area. Its say there are 909 people according to their data with that surname:<br>  <a href="http://cognome.alfemminile.com/w/cognomi/cognome-firenze.html" rel="nofollow">http://cognome.alfemminile.com/w/cognomi...</a><br>  <br>  I found on another site a few of places where there is this surname.

Q4NFFBizaa	why do you need money on the border? Everyone in mexico will take your dollar bills.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	First, everyone will NOT take dollar bills.<br>  <br>  A lot depends on where you are crossing. The larger crossing stations are better equipped.<br>  <br>  I don't know what border line you mean. Once you get your FM-T tourist visa, you will need to go to a bank to pay the fees. In most immigration offices, there are banks close by. They may or may not change dollars to pesos as well, I don't know, I have always paid in pesos.<br>  <br>  There are ATMs all over. You should just withdraw the money you will need in pesos for that day from the machine. <br>  <br>  If you are talking about casa de cambio, money changers, larger banks will change money. There are small shops that offer this service as well. Hand them the dollars and say "Pesos, por favor". Near the border that will be enough and they will know what you want. They are harder to find open on weekends.

I think a Macau tycoon tried this project many years ago and it failed. Do not get me wrong, Casinos bring capital, jobs and prosperity to fund programs like poverty alleviation, education and  health care in the localities they are operating at. And by the way, why not call the project a Plan to Make Somewhere in Manila the Entertainment Capital?

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Items bought while on a cruise are duty free. That just means that there is no sales tax or import duty payable at the time of purchase. A US resident does not have to pay any duty when returning to the US if the total purchases are less than $800. Above that customs charges a percentage of the value. Many states now ask you to declare anything purchased outside of the state on your state income tax and pay sales tax. Declaring your purchases is up to you. They have no way to check.<br>  <br>  Excursions are not taxable items.<br>  <br>  Note that some foreign countries will charge their own sales tax. You are not exempt from that. Some have programs to return the tax to you if you are a tourist and meet certain requirements.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|EoEjbKpzaa	I don't believe that it applies for the excursions because they are planned through the cruise line. when you get off the ship and purchase things everything is duty free, no taxes, and most things you by you can bargain.

9f5169159afb1c45757aaedd7e065b7caa	The city of Irving on the west side of Dallas has many, many Carnecerias (Mexican meat markets) that sell goat meat.  They are on every major street in town.  Just look for the tag that says "cabrito," (goat meat).  Also, if you go into a Taqueria (small Mexican taco stand/restaurant) and order tacos or barbecue, it will probably be cabrito, not beef.  It is very good, very tasty.  Love it.|`|mDYsr62maa	None in the city, but you should be able to find goat at any of the Hispanic markets in the city, and most meat markets will carry it as well.
YBbumuyFaa	China in general is not exactly vegetarian friendly. In fact, many Chinese think the concept of vegetarianism is a bit strange. Eating meat is a bit of a social status thing and a show of prosperity, because not so long ago, eating meat was a luxury for most people here. In some poor parts of the countryside, it still is.<br>  <br>  However, like I said, it is still possible to keep a vegetarian diet here. Restaurants often have a good mix of both meat and vegetable (or tofu) dishes. So if you are ordering for yourself, its not too bad. The problem comes in if you are attending some kind of banquet. Then you are likely to encounter a lot of meat. If that happens, I would just politely inform the host that you don't eat meat.<br>  <br>  I would recommend picking up a Lonely Planet guidebook. I believe it lists restaurants in each city by food type, vegetarian being one of the categories. There are even some restaurants that specialize in making fake meat dishes from tofu.<br>  <br>  Also a rule of thumb when looking for vegetarian food is to look for Indian Restaurants. There are quite a few in Beijing and Shanghai. Although they may serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes but they will suit your purpose just fine.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/archive/2008-03/18/content_12962113.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.china.org.cn/archive/2008-03/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/beijing/dinning/indian.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguid...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.indianembassy.org.cn/Indian_Restaurants_in_china.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianembassy.org.cn/Indian_R...</a>|`|rVbY5qBsaa	Rice and vegetables :)|`|CEKZsoFRaa	noodles, rice and veggies|`|Wvj6o1XZaa	A lot of things.<br>  Rice, vegetable stir-fry, vegetarian egg rolls, chow mein, low mein...|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Get over your label of 'vegetarian' and enjoy the food that China has to offer..............|`|7ES4xMloaa	eat raw veggies and dont stay long, china like every other country on earth loves the meat|`|yQdA5rHnaa	vegetables|`|P5rfNdFEaa	When I went to Beijing, they had lots of vegetarian dishes.  Actually the Chinese don't waste anything.  They have a dish for every part of an animal and a dish for almost every vegetables.  The only problem is that, if you're a pure vegetarian then you might not like the way they prepare their vegetarian dishes.  They usually stir fry them in the same left over juices as their meat dishes.  It brings out the flavor but pure vegetarians might not like eating meat juice along with their vegetables.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	when you come to the restaurant you just show a waiter a special paper where it's written in Chinese "I'm a vegetarian, what vegetable dishes do you have?"...<br>  if you want, you may also add phrases like "no eggs" and "no fish oil"...<br>  <br>  there are many yummy dishes made of plants and beans, for example tofu with something so it's very easy to please your stomach and to keep your diet principles...|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Spring rolls are obvious choice.

I have lived here for 2.5 years and there are many restaurants that serve great veggie, tofu, rice, and noodle dishes.  if you are unsure of the dish, make sure you have a few phrases with you in both Chinese character and pinyin (character written in English alphabet) saying you don't eat meat, that you are a vegetarian, or to ask if a certain dish has meat.

eCjx7kLAaa	Most likely the lack of big cities.  Bands, especially when doing limited tours, and/or new artists, only hit the places they can be sure to draw a large crowd, and think they have a large fan base willing to pay for their tickets.  Also, a lot of it has nothing to do with the band, their record label and managers figure out where they are going, and it is mostly based on profit and going places likely to have the most impact in promoting their name, i.e. media market size.  Getting your name broadcast over a Houston radio station means a lot more than a Mobile radio station.  And 1600 people in Birmingham could be 16,000 in Chicago.

AA12243895	speaking from experience all technical schools are a quick fix to real college and all they do is screw up your credit by approving you for a bunch of loans that you never ask for. yes the programs are short and relatively easy but most technical schools end up closing down or changing names. they usually lose accreditation and none of the hours transfer to any other college or university. they are ok if you have a specific industry you want to go into and you want to do it in a short amount of time. i have an associates from a now defunct school that helped me land a job at a major hospital, a great job that i kept for years before returning to UH. i was young and had just had my daughter so technical school seemed like a good idea. and it was, for the moment. i learned a lot of valuable job skills that i used in the real world and have they have helped put me ahead of my UH peers.so it may not be all bad depending on what you are looking for. my cousin who lived with me while attending Texas School of Business finished school but never found a job. it was not helpful to her and she ended up moving back to Louisiana.|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	the only bad thing is that  you do NOT get any college hours for it

You will have days in the 30s and days in the 70s. <br>  So when you take your baby out, I'd suggest dressing him warmly and take extra blankets. You can always take some layers off if it feels warm once you are out and about. It won't be consistently warm(60s and above) until mid-late April. And even then we will still have a chilly day in the 50s here and there.|`|iRFsu2kVaa	If you move further south you'll find most days start to average 50o in late February-early March.

73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	Loads of typical "Guido"s. Not so much emo that I know of.<br>  <br>  Guido: A sad pathetic excuse for a male; not necessarily of Italian descent, but most likely; usually native to the New York/New Jersey Tri-State area.<br>  <br>  WARDROBE: tight zipper shirts, tracksuits, designer jeans, fuzzy kangol hats, tiny hoop earrings, fake gold chains, and related Euro-trash garb and tacky cheese-wear.<br>  <br>  NATURAL HABITAT: Known to frequent Tri-State area malls looking for club gear to waste their week's pay on (most likely spotted shopping at "Bang Bang" in Staten Island). During the day when not at their food delivery, telemarketting, or construction job, can be located at their local gym tanning or lifting weights. Can be found nightly at mainstream danceclubs they read about online (SF, Webster Hall, Etc.). Most notable for cruising the Jersey shore in an old car (Honda, Mustang, etc.) which has been tinted, painted and sports $1,000-$3,000 rims in a feeble attempt to look like new. Guido cars usually have a boomin' system through which cheesy music like freestyle, commercial club/trance and hip-hop (anything KTU plays) is loudly blasted.<br>  <br>  GENETIC LINKS: Directly related to modern day urban-guidos, A.K.A. "wiggers," A.K.A. "wegros;" urban-guidos are white males who once exhibited the traits referenced above, but have now instead opted to keep it unreal, with wardrobes consisting of clothes from labels like FUBU and Rocawear which they bought on sale at Macy's. These individuals still listen to the same music and drive the same type of car as their predecessor; it is usually just their choice of attire and use of slang and poor speech skills that differentiate them from the classic guido. Most guidos are distrusting of non-whites despite the fact some of their attire and music can be traced to non-white origins.<br>  <br>  PASSTIMES/RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES: Guidos enjoy beating up a non-white or homosexual while assisted by a group of 5-10 guido friends backing them up; engaging in date rape; and displaying their lack of rhythm by dancing poorly in the middle of a club's dance floor while non-guidos look on in disbelief. <br>  <br>  I'd like to add that Guidos also come in a female variety. Big black hair, orange tan and the biggest loudest mouths lined with shiny red gloss.|`|XwXuJIF8aa	I am ex Jersey guy. Mostly aggressive, scarastic.

Because of the draw of NYC and Philly, but being generally cheaper to live, there are tons of people of all types all over the state.  Interesting about the emo comment, I don't know if there's a larger than normal proportion of emo culture in NJ, but much of the recent emo/punk musical movement originated in North Jersey and Long Island.  Also, as the state is largely wealthy and suburban, it is the ideal location for that culture to take hold amongst the legions of bored teenagers.

ozK2hKJZaa	This is a yes and no question. Yes, because it connects to Lake Geneva so you can cruise up and down between the Mediterranean and lake Geneva. Otherwise it's a no, because it's a small sea connecting to a lake so in the middle of it all, there will be a small inlet that is a run-off river. The run-off can be a little tricky to handle, it will be a little shallow there, sometimes it can be full of water but it happens rarely. Plus the currents there might blow you backwards. Okay, here is your second question, it does not connect the Rhine River. The Rhine River is by Germany. The Mediterranean is by France and Italy, there is no river that leads there.

lc7SLrPlaa	As you previously mentioned to me, you wanted to modify your wardrobe. This would be the perfect time to do so. Take clothes that you like, ones that fit into your new style. I'd say you would only need about two weeks worth of clothing. Keep in mind that what you don't take you can get there or have mailed to you. As for shoes, i would take at least two pairs of neutral shoes and three of you absolute favorites. Same goes for jackets. From there JUST TAKE THE NECESSITIES!!! You can take your makeup and hair straighteners but you don't need toiletries like shampoo. Stuff like that you can get there they just take up space. Obviously you are going to need a toothbrush and deodorant. From there your electronics and phone chargers. If you want your itunes back it up on an exterior hard drive. And lastly, your memories. Things that remind you of home, your stuff animals and pictures. The glass jar...and all my love.<br>  <br>  hope this helps:) i love you mimi <3
biKMQ2I1aa	call the schools and ask...it varies|`|211Wwh6Laa	Basically, if you call a school for information, and they seem vague or glib, they either want to sucker you in with all the perks before slamming you with an outrageous cost...or they are expensive and not worth the money.<br>  <br>  If you haven't already, look at this link <a href="http://www.beautyschoolsdirectory.com/find/index.php?overturejeanmadeline=y&searchterm=jean_madeline&search=Y/?overture_jean_madeline_aveda_institute_b&OVRAW=jean%20madeline%20aveda%20institute%20tuition%20costs&OVKEY=jean%20madeline%20aveda%20institute&OVMTC=advanced&OVADID=23382242011&OVKWID=176647835011" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyschoolsdirectory.com/fi...</a> and find the exact school that you want, and request information.  They'll call you, and when they do, ask.  <br>  <br>  I looked at the Jean Madeline site to see if I could help (I've been learning quite a bit about navigating these school sites in my search for a college, and know trying to figure out how to get info. without calling is like pulling teeth, so I thought I'd try a few of my tricks), but there's nothing...you have to call or have them call you.  Here's the request for information form <a href="http://www.jeanmadeline.com/jmi_info-form.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jeanmadeline.com/jmi_info-for...</a><br>  <br>  This looks like a pretty legitimate school, and I know I'd heard of them during my modeling training (one of the students was hired by Allure...and an instructor there worked as a fashion or beauty editor for Allure)...so my guess is that it's probably an excellent school both by reputation and educational standards.  They are probably going to try to get you "hooked" before they tell you the astronomical cost.  Hope not, though!

URZNtrxsaa	Hi There,<br>  If we new the answer to that, then we would all be rich!! Let me give you some examples of how the rate fluctuates in just the past two years.

d754b3be3baefac8167410c09de8770faa	Since you're going on a cross country road trip, the best car(s) to take on a road trip are those made by Chevy. The Cobalt (4-door) and the Mailbu are the best ones to take. Chevy cars are the best of the GM products because they are the best on mpg in the city and the highway. If you want the most for your gas mileage, i suggest getting these Chevy models. If your 2-3 people should back out and cancel, go for the Cobalt (2-door). This will really help you.|`|tkM1a0dWaa	Challenger|`|5d69a2b5acd5128b7f6ba155c12e4e78aa	The only car I drive is one of my Astin Martin DBS's.

A minivan might be a good idea plus you can sleep in it and not have to get a hotel. A station wagon would be good also.<br>  <br>  A lease would be the dumbest idea since you have to keep the car under a certain mileage. You'd blow through a years worth of miles on your trip.<br>  <br>  If you can find a van in good shape you can buy it, drive around for your trip and then sell it when you get back. A boss of mine did that with his buddies.

AA11184785	Although Gaelic is widely accepted as the official language of Scotland each area have their own unique languages.<br>  For example, I live in Aberdeenshire in NE Scotland & we speak Doric. <br>  It really is just a bastardised form of english but even people from other parts of Scotland find it impossible to understand.<br>  <br>  As for our currency, we use the same as in England but do have Scottish banknotes in the same denominations as England. We accept english notes but they will not accept ours, even though both are legal tender anywhere in the British Isles.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Gaelic is a language still spoken in the Highlands.  The dialect of English spoken in the rest of Scotland is called Scots.|`|fKpBXXJbaa	There's actually two Scottish languages - "Scots" which is a Germanic language very closely related to English, and "Gaelic" which is a Celtic language closely related to Irish.<br>  <br>  There's a joke that goes "a language is a dialect with an army and a navy", but linguists nowadays do consider that Scots is a language in its own right, about as close to English as Danish is to Norwegian. With languages there's often a continuum of dialects where as you travel along the language changes a little bit, and every now and again someone declares there's a standard national language -  for example, with West Germanic languages you can start in Belgium with Flemish, which is not quite the same as Dutch, then when you get to the borderland between the Netherlands and Germany there's not much difference in the language the people on the two sides of the border speak, though people on one side will say they're speaking Dutch and people on the other side will say they're speaking German. The dialects continue to change over distance, so eventually you get to the stage where people in north Germany think Bavarians talk funny, and vice versa, and it goes on into Austria, and when you get into the Swiss mountains no outsiders can understand the local dialects even though they're supposed to be German. Heading in the other direction, Frisian is close to Dutch, and until around about 1400, Frisian and English-speakers were supposed to be able to understand each other. Dialects continued to develop on this side of the sea too - Chaucer wrote that in the late 1300s some merchants from London were travelling to the continent, and stopped off in Kent to buy some eggs, but had great difficulty making known what they wanted because the word in London was "egges", but in Kent it was "eyren". Eventually the Oxford/Cambridge dialect became standard English, but the Scottish version which developed from Northumbrian English was considerably different, so it's effectively a separate language. Most people will of course use an accented version of Standard English when talking to strangers or foreigners, but may use Scots among themselves.<br>  <br>  As for Scottish currency, no, it's the same as the currency in the rest of the UK, the Pound Sterling (GBP). Scottish banknotes are not legal tender anywhere (and neither are English banknotes legal tender outside England and Wales), but this does not prevent people accepting the local notes if they want to.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Scots Gaelic is still spoken by many people in rural parts of Scotland, but English is the primary language, of which there are numerous different dialects in Scotland. Nevertheless, Scotland is officially a bilingual country and you'll see signs written in both English and Gaelic.<br>  <br>  Scotland is part of the UK so it doesn't have its own currency, it uses the UK Pound Sterling (GBP). The major Scottish banks print their own sterling banknotes though, and these are very different in design to the notes issued by the Bank of England and by the various Northern Irish banks.<br>  <br>  Scottish banknotes are widely accepted in Northern England, but not (in my experience) in the South of England. And the Northern Irish notes are not widely accepted outside of Northern Ireland. However, the Bank of England notes are accepted everywhere in the UK, including Scotland.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	There is Gaelic, which not many know nowadays.

Get on as a WALK ON passenger--it's cheap, and hang out in Kingston long enough to have an inexpensive fast food meal for lunch and/or walk along the beach on that side. <br>  <br>  When you're back in Edmonds, you can spend time on the beach on that side as well. <br>  <br>  Get the bus to downtown Seattle, catch the monorail to the Seattle Center and walk around the grounds there. Even if you don't have the money to check out the displays at the Pacific Science Center, Experience Music Project, etc., you can go into Center House for free (it's where all the food courts are). People watching is good and it won't cost you anything more than any food you buy. <br>  <br>  If you can catch a bus that gets you into the Green Lake area, you can walk the 3 mile path around the lake and gawk at all the sunbathers and runners in the area.|`|lECtqGHSaa	space needle is fun sorta pricy but fun

XOgvpDiZaa	You're staying at a Ohana WAIKIKI hotel. You put in "k" where a "w" should be. No wonder none of the previous posters knew where you were staying. (I even googled the name and got nothing, with "ohana kaikiki").<br>  <br>  Now that I know you're staying on Oahu in Waikiki...<br>  <br>  I suggest the Beachcomber hotel. It's just a walk from there to Waikiki Beach (and close to the International Marketplace and the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center).<br>  <br>  Other info:<br>  -For shopping in town there's Ala Moana and Ward (it also houses a 16-screen movie theater which is amazing)<br>  -Don't expect NOT to have rain when you visit<br>  -Catch the Magic of Polynesia show (it's located at the Beachcomber). Great show!<br>  -If your family is renting a car, get out of Waikiki and head out to the Pali Lookout, which is located on Pali Highway. You'll get spectacular views of the Windward side and scenery. It'll be windy too so hold on to your hats.<br>  -Head up to the North Shore to experience what old Hawaii was like. It's a colorful little town with Matsumoto Shave Ice, the most popular shave ice (snowcone to you) on the island. There's always a long line. It's also home to nice beaches.<br>  -Take a surfing lesson<br>  -Hike Diamond Head<br>  -Visit Bishop Museum<br>  -Swim with the dolphins at Sea Life Park<br>  <br>  Not sure if that's the info you wanted (what to do on Oahu), but there you go. :-)|`|AA11142587	My husband just went to San Antonio, lol. The flight is about 6-7 hours.

As for the flight, I doubt you can get a direct flight from Texas, or maybe if you're going to Honolulu you can, but from Texas to Cali it's about 2 hours, plus layover time, then a 6 hour flight to Oahu.<br>  <br>  Can't think of anything else you should know, I'm not too familiar with the area you'll be going to.  Hope you get some help :)

rE7MYpQtaa	I love to answer these kinds of questions =) but anyways as for entertainment, restaurants, and things like that,some great attractions are Nascar SpeedPark, Broadway at the Beach, Barefoot Landing, Planet Hollywood, Ripley's Aquarium, Ripley's 4-D Adventure, Atlantis Putt-Putt golfing, The Dixie Stampede, and Deep Sea Fishing with the Hurricane Fleet, to name a few. Truly, these are fun whether you are 4 or 40.  You can also go to club Kryptonite (if your old enough) Some Awesome places to eat are Benjamin's's Original Calabash Seafood, The Filling Station (Pizza), and T-Bones (at Barefoot Landing). Umm you can go to Barefoot Landing and Broadway at the Beach (I go to Barefoot landing in the day normally, but if you go at night they have a cool little carnival-like thing)...but don't waste your time going to the mall, it sucks, although, there is a place called outdoor world there and it is really interesting. they have a huge fishtank with small sharks in it and there are daiIy shark feedings. I hope that this info has helped you. I have been to Myrtle Beach 13 years in a row, so i know my way around pretty well. Have a great trip!

That means an island more than 200 km from any existing claimed island and which also has not already been claimed, as most countries assert an economic zone of 200 km.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could buy an island and stage a rebellion against the existing government.  They may, or may not, notice.  It will depend on whether there is a possibility of valuable resources nearby.  If you want to get an idea of the nonsense that can go on, do a search on the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.|`|AA12082232	You could but it's a matter of having people/countries/organisations recognize its sovereignty.

7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	Not quite possible as is too short. Its possible if you treat it as your sidetrip, but definetely not a daytrip, as Taiwan is a flight away from Hong Kong and the airports in Taiwan are all a bit far from any attractions as those located far away from its main city. If you really want to have a daytrip, invest on a visa to mainland China and Shenzhen and Guangzhou is quite worth a visit. If not, you can also head towards its outer lying Islands like Lantau, Lamma Island, Cheung Chau, Peng Chau etc as they all have its own charm and attractions and its just a ferry ride away and at most 30 min of your time to travel there. Most of all, no need to exit Hong Kong and no separate visa needed.|`|4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	It's possible, but an expensive day trip.  What I would do is not worry as much about hitting Taipei.  You might be able to find a flight out of Hong Kong to Taichung, in central Taiwan.  Then a taxi ride into the main part of Taichung will probably take about 20 minutes and cost around $500 NT (About $15-20 US)  <br>  <br>  I love Taiwan, but I agree with the others that there are better options for a day trip.  I think the price of your flight just wouldn't make it worthwhile for me personally, but if you're asking if iit's doable, yes... it is.|`|ZtPdNnIZaa	nope! it's been 2 rush. as Taiwan is a diff country apart fr HK. it's take over 90 mins flight to arv there. then another 1 hr headed to the city area. but beside Macau, NT & Lantau... i guess u can visit Shenzhen also as it's just 45 mins train n ppl always go daytrip there 4 cheap shopping.|`|qpp0bb46aa	Absolutely (even without Prof. Lee's assistance)!<br>  1.

Daytrips from HK would be Macau or cities in Guangdong Province. Zhuhai for a relaxing day by the sea or Shenzhen to buy cheap knockoffs. It doesn't take long to get to Guangzhou from HK by train, either. Shenzhen and Guangzhou don't have reputations for being safe cities, though. Additionally, you could also consider taking a ferry to one of the outlying islands in HK.|`|cexE1ji8aa	No, it will be a waste of money on airticket only.|`|2ea51KKlaa	1 day in Taiwan is way too short.

dpKntiZoaa	I can answer a couple and I'm afraid then the others wouldn't then apply<br>  <br>  For an non-EU citizien this is becoming impossibly difficult to get a job in the EU anyway. To obtain this, you must have a job offer from an employer, and this employer will have to obtain a work permit on your behalf. <br>  <br>  This exercise is (a) costly (b) takes time - can be up to 6 months and (c) difficult - the employer must prove that the job has been advertised for at least 6 weeks and also credible reasons why it cannot be fulfilled by another EU member citizen. <br>  <br>  Taking into consideration the recession which is biting hard, then this option is nigh impossible for someone without very specalist skils/experience (who could therefore also apply for the highly skilled migrant tier) - working as a general worker in the catering industry will not get you this permit as there are hundreds of thousands of people within the EU who could fulful the vacancy and no employer would try to prove otherwise.<br>  <br>  I answered a question from a fellow American and this gives a lot more details on how difficult it is (granted this is for the Netherlands, but the general principles apply throughout the EU) and you can read more here if this helps <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoNhS_x5OwfyI.GZJm2WjL_ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081029005645AAYhd63">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Concerning being an English teacher, I am afraid that this would not be considered a specialist job as of course Europe has native speakers in the UK & Ireland.  Also Danes generally have a very high level of English and (same as here in the Netherlands) foreign language teachers are not necessarily native speakers.  Indeed very few are.<br>  <br>  You would not be able to work as a freelance writer for sure and a translator would require you to speak Danish to a very high level with qualifications<br>  <br>  I realise that it looks like I am being very negative, but unfortunately (same as in the US), in the last 10 years there have been massive movements of immigrants into the EU and as a result, immigration policies have been substantially tightened as a result<br>  <br>  For official info you can read the info on the Danish immigration dept site <a href="http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/work/work.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to...</a>  It is a really good site actually answering all questions very clearly.|`|g8JGLnk6aa	I love Denmark.

If you were willing to share a flat with other people, you could pay DKK 2500-4000 for a room<br>  <br>  Yes it is difficult to get a work visa if you don't have specialized skills that no EU citizen can fill.Or you can get transferred over by a company if you are at management level (I got transferred over by a US company that had offices in Denmark) <br>  <br>  As the other poster says, teaching English is not a specialized skill. There are plenty of Danes who are fluent enough in English to teach it (most English teachers in Denmark are Danes), as well as thousands of English and Irish working as English teachers<br>  <br>  I don't know how you would do translation work unless you were completely fluent in Danish. There are plenty of fluent Danish-English speakers already in the country. As for freelance writing, there is only one English language weekly paper, the Copenhagen Post (www.cphpost.dk) that you could try to get a job with, but it wouldn't pay your rent. <br>  <br>  Minimum tax rate is 50% but it rises based on your income<br>  <br>  Healthcare is free and easy to get if you are a legal resident. When you register with your commune, you get a booklet listing doctors offices in your area and you register with the one close to you.<br>  <br>  I moved to Denmark from NY and the cost of living is at least 40% higher. Food, drinks, entertainment, utilities, insurance, cars, etc are all much more expensive in Denmark.

URZNtrxsaa	guess you have not been here long. At noon today in AZ, it was 2:00pm in NYC today, and at Noon in AZ tomorrow, it will be 3:00pm in NYC tomorrow with the switch tonight to DST. <br>  <br>  We don't change our clocks here in the summers because if it was 120' in your neighborhood during the day, would you want an extra hour of sunlight.  <br>  <br>  FYI, parts of AZ do follow DST up on the indian reservation in NE Arizona.|`|1Mu14qcQaa	Paulie--I believe that the sun shines the same amount of time regardless of how we set our clocks :)<br>  <br>  Arizona is one of the few places that doesn't observe daylight saving time. We are always on Mountain standard time, while the other Mountin time zone states switch to mountain daylight time.  <br>  <br>  Since the Pacific states also observer daylight savings (Pacific Daylight time), Arizona shares the same time as california during the summer.
WNfffzGiaa	That's where I went to school. I absolutely loved it. It was a really good experience. I can't imagine if I had gone to a more traditional university.<br>  <br>  And to the person above me: All colleges are party schools. Don't bash suburb kids.|`|7x9lvbhAaa	are you talking about the columbia college in sc are chiago?|`|bFfWFsFWaa	The Columbia College in Chicago has a reputation of being a party school. Most kids go there who have grown up in suburbs and don't want to leave home just yet.<br>  <br>   I used to hear very good things about it, and then I got to the age where I started to actually look into schools. Don't be fooled by your first impression. It's a party school. Not a very good education, and I haven't really heard of any good programs. I've had two friends go who were complete drunks. They love it. And four friends went who ended up dropping out within the first year or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>      All schools are party schools huh? True, but some more then others. You can't compare Notre Dame to Columbia. Or UofI to Predue. Columbia isn't all that great. Oh yeah and...I'm a suburb kid.

Israel was there first; the Muslims stole the land from the Jews, and now they want to call the Jews "occupiers?"  Absurd!<br>  <br>  In my opinion, Hamas and Hezbollah, in other words Iran, are true Islamic murder machines.  They don't even care if their own people get slaughtered; that's why they hide behind women and children when attacking.  What cowards!

I am not opposed to the existence of Israel. I AM opposed to its terrorism. Big difference.|`|RRaASyBGaa	Well I'm arab but I've been living in australia all my life. I'm Pro-Palestine, but i don't hate all jews. I think that, yes, the jews should have some of the land, but I dont think that it is fair that the Palestinians have been completly wiped off the map and more than 1 million people forced to live in such a small area of the whole land. I certainly don't think that it would be better if there were no jewish state, that would just put them in the same position as the Palestinians are in now. My personal solution would be to have 2 seperate states, dividing the land according to population density (if there are more palestinians, they get more land, if there are more israelis, they get more land), that way everyone can live peacefully, even though the Palestinians are the rightful owners of all of the land. <br>  <br>  My main dislike is when the Israeli government and army kill thousands of Palestinians for only 1 Israeli killed, it makes me think that they think that their lives are worthless. The recent happenings in Gaza in January, in my eyes were cold blood murder and I think that the Israelis were completely to balme.<br>  <br>  As i said before, I don't dislike all jews and Israelis, only the ones who are killing the Palestinians and those who support them. I have many jewish friends despite the fact that I am muslim and i hope that one day, we can all live in peace without war and hatred.<br>  <br>  I hope you value my opinion and I would like to apologise if i have offended you in any way.|`|jKW69YXzaa	While I support both Palestinian and Israeli countries, I do not support partitioning, I believe that they should be unified under the name.....'Palestine', Why?<br>  <br>  The only reason the so called Israel exists is because the British gave it to them? Britain had no right to do so, Lands are owned by the people who live in it. The people who lived in this geographical area are entitled to it. But yet they were kicked out and massacred. Jews were kicked out of 100's locations of the world, over history. Hmmm, Is it always the problem those countries? Hmm..I don't think so.<br>  <br>  If the Ottoman Empire still existed, Israel wouldn't, Instead Britain claimed Palestine. Gave it to the Jews to get rid of them in Europe. Why? No Country would take them in... So they just saw that they had justification to take over Palestine.<br>  <br>  And to the Dude who said in the 60 years Israel gave the world more contributions then the arab would that is 100% BS, you may want to look at this <a href="http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&intSectionID=309" rel="nofollow">http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?...</a><br>  <br>  Did Israeli contributions help develop stuff like Smallpox vaccinations and contribute to medicine? like eyesight and anatomy. No l don't think so. Plus if it wasn't for the Arabs, Mathmatics, Astronomy and Medicine would be so underdeveloped as Arabs preserved Greek works, while others burned them because the church said it made people heretics. if Andalus wasn't founded in Spain by the Muslims. The European Renaissance wouldn't have happened and you would all have your veins cut if you were sick to get rid of the excess bile, phlegm, blood or whatever. I think you would enjoy that. The Muslim world was flourishing and improved these works, first modern hospital was established in Cairo (Ahmad ibn T?l?n Hospital).<br>  <br>  Also since Europe is such a safe place now that Hitler is no more, let the Jews go back there. lets see the tolerance that people will give them, I'm sure they will be welcomed back. Right? ;)<br>  <br>  Also if Israel is so powerful and capable then wy didn't they kill everyone in Gaza. They can't... If the Arabs wanted they could have united and annihilated Israel, but no because we want our relations with the U.S to be good. No wonder the Soviets, Germans, Chinese wanted to be self dependant.<br>  <br>  Also if the Jews were 'still strong' lets look at statistics, In 2000 The number of Christians in the world was 2,039 million, number of Muslims was 1,226 million and the number of Jews *Drumroll* was 14.5 million, Hinduism a polytheistic religion had 828 million people. Most people convert to Islam and Christianity but not Judaism. Nothing against the Jews, because Islam and Judaism are alike. I'm sure the statistics have stayed the same because I've read a reference on a research I was doing  and the numbers were still proportional to the 2000 figure (It was the 2006 figure) as Christianity was dropping, Islam was growing, Judaism was Declining.<br>  <br>  O, and Judaism was meant to restore monotheism, Christianity was supposed to succeed and replace Judaism and Islam was also supposed to succeed and replace Christianity, And If Muslims corrupted their books and forged the quran, Islam would also be replaced, but as of yet it hasn't been so yea....Another reason why Muslim women shouldn't marry non-Muslim men and Muslim men can marry Monotheistic believing women. Islam also goes in depth into subjects. It talked deeply in the laws on various life affairs and take into consideration the corruption of people back in the days and placed rules to protect them. Islam is different than other religions, It is detailed. If the Bible was an encyclopedia the torah would be a short novel and the Quran would be the whole set of encyclopedias<br>  <br>  Let me tell you something else, if George W. Bush wasn't president 9/11 wouldn't have happened, it was clearly an inside, even our Islamaphobic American teacher thinks that and he worked for the U.S navy. If It wasn't for Israel the Middle east would have had peace. it was only after Israel did the conflicts start. But I believe Israel will just fade to a bitter memory, occupying one pharagraph.<br>  <br>  Btw, I'm half-Greek/half-Arab and a Muslim and I'm happy. I've got good genes, the right religion. And I'm happy :).|`|i00SbscLaa	I don't think people just wake up in the morning and say they oppose Israel for no reasons.<br>  Most people including Jews  have contentions with Israel over Human Right issues.<br>  <br>  The right of the native people of Palestine to live on their native land in peace.<br>  <br>  The Israeli occupation of other people land.<br>  <br>  The Israeli collective punishments of civilians.<br>  <br>  The Israeli illegal settlements built on Palestinian land.<br>  <br>  If Israel has the right to exist so Palestine has the right to exist too.<br>  <br>  If Israel has the right to self defense so do the Palestinians.|`|74RNHyxHaa	I believe that the followers of Islam, Judaism and Christianity all deserve to live in Palestine, equally. All three religions have a history and background there, all have a claim to it as a Holy Land.  <br>  It would be best if there was no Jewish state, for the reason that the current Jewish state is causing half the problems in the Middle East. The main problem is Zionism and it's policies. If you get rid of the Zionists, then there can be peace. I don't dislike Jews, I dislike Israelis who approve of the things happening to the Palestinians, whether they are Jewish or not. It's not about religion, its about humanity.|`|19ec41e42df6e58799e9d9a266240579aa	the big difference between Israel and the Muslim nations is that the Muslims were there first. In Malaysia, of course the Muslims are the majority, and they were there first. I dont want to sound racist, but the locals at that time did not stop the immigration of the Chinese and Indians to Malaysia, and when they came, the Malays even gave them citizenship. Why would u call it unfair?? Its true that the Muslims are given some privileges, but that is to be expected. Even if u go to China, or Japan, no one but Chinese or Japanese can become their respective president. The Israelis on the other hand came to Palestine, and drove her people out, and now makes a big fuss about them being fair, while still discriminating the Arab Israelis??Proof: The education given to Jewish children of Israel is way higher quality than the education for the Arab Israeli. The way these 2 groups are treated is so different, that u can call it a double standard.|`|Me2oJOtAaa	Shalom, <br>  <br>  I used to live in israel to :)  <br>  <br>  I personally am for Israel all the way. It has a right to exist, it NEEDS to exist .its our homeland... its where we came from and its where we turn to every time we pray. <br>  <br>  Its actions may not always be perfect but i think our people deserve and have a right to live in our own land..<br>  <br>  Israel in 60 years has given the world more scientific and medical discoveries than the whole of the arab world put together... <br>  <br>  I wonder where all these poeple so keen to rant against our land would be without the israeli invented pcs and technology to voice their opinions in the first place ! :) <br>  <br>  My personal solution to the arab israeli conflict would be to give them their own state - with access to - but not ownership of jerusalem.. <br>  <br>  and if they dont accept then i think then it would be time to really go to war once and for all... people have pushed us around for too long... no other country would be expected to tolerate such a long and constant state of war so why should we ? <br>  <br>  I think unfortunatly you are going to get a lot of retarded remarks to what is really a sensible question ) <br>  <br>  There are a lot of people around here who are so anti semtic they would make hitler look friendly! <br>  <br>  There is still a lot of archaic anti semitic beliefs out there- from us all wanting to take over the world ( really - if we could do that you think we would have done it by now though - like - what are we supposed to be waiting for ? !  ) to the playground stuff about us being inbreds etc <br>  <br>  ignore them.<br>  <br>   In more than 5000 years of our history i dont know one account where name calling has hurt us and you only have to look back in history to see that even the biggest attempt to wipe us out - from the egyptians to hitler - havent succeeded. <br>  <br>  On the plus side- there are lots of people out there who support israel and jews. And while the arab and muslim world is busy throwing tantrums and blowing each other up, israel and the jewish people are advancing and getting stronger every day :) <br>  <br>  AM ISRAEL CHAI ! :) EIN LI ERETZ ACHERET :)|`|PHQy22VUaa	I am glad you asked this, Because really, I have  , and I know this sounds trite, but its the truth, great friends that are jewish. friends I would consider some of my best. the problem is that 'israel' is based on a racist ideology.  A state that privileges one group. The jew.  This will never work unless you live like the bubble boy, inside a jew bubble. I do not think israel should exist for this reason.  I think jews  like any race should live in that region if they pay their way, work and follow laws, and give equal rights and human rights to any human being... but most jews don't there.they want , want. want.  They want the land, they want the jewish only state,   they want the pride, they want the greed.   They want the biblical exile myth that has become an industry especially in  the days after WW2.   It is ugly. ..  Over 1000 children were killed or maimed permanently this last war over there ..   What if that was YOUR CHILD   >      Blinded and crippled by white phosphorous and bombs at a children's school. or hospital... or your private home.... The jew immigrant is almost like a crazy psycho.   Thinking they have the right to kill people for their  'belief system'..   It is insanity.... and Americans that are aware of this are sickened to death... because the world knows that the USA has been welfaring and supplying the apartheid state of Israel for decades with our threats and tax dollars and private jew donations...... and the world disrespects us and hates us for it .....and rightfully so..  This is so NOT AMERICAN.... Americans do not want the jew philosophy to harm us anymore.  America is made up of every race and religion on this earth. Why should we help protect a radical group of " jews" that do not only NOT  pay their way  ,   but KILL CHILDREN AND TORTURE young Palestinians.    USA just outlawed torture for good.     Now ask your jewish friends if this made sense, because  I  am truly trying to talk to you and we do not have that much time. We are all one on this planet whether you like it or not. We all share it. ...And you must put your ridiculous belief system behind you once and for all.|`|lvWqfnfpaa	I'm am not an Arab but I do strongly support Palestine.<br>  <br>  Israel? Israel does not exist. What exists is Palestine which has been renamed Israel.<br>  <br>  Okay, Britain GAVE Palestine to the Jews. Who do the British think they are? They think they can just give any piece of land to anyone they want in this world? Who gave them this right? The Jews came and just took over. Think of a family just moving into your house and being in charge without your parents permission. Makes you feel uncomfortable, right? Well, the Palestinians have been living like this for almost sixty one years.<br>  <br>  A Jewish homeland SHOULD exist. But somewhere else i.e. America where people love them so much<br>  <br>  Do you see the kind of things people from your country say above? Palestinians can be Jews, Muslims and Christians. But these ignorant fools forget that 'Palestinian' is an ethnicity, not a religion<br>  <br>  I dont hate Jews or Israelis. But what I do strongly dislike is thieves, liars, murderers and cry babies.

D0bwDLXJaa	I was on a plane a few months ago, and a family of four was traveling on the same flight. Mom and daughter just happened to be seated right in front of me, and the little girl kept turning around and smiling at me for about the first half hour of the trip. Then all of a sudden, she started getting louder and louder and jumping all over the place. Before her mom could stop her, she had jumped over her mom and down the aisle heading toward the bathroom. I felt sorry for the mom, but at the same time wondered if they corrected her at home. It took another half hour for Mom to get the daughter to calm down, and she finally decided to just keep looking at me. I don't always like loud kids(especially on long flights), but I also kept making eye contact with this little girl and kept smiling back at her, and pretty soon, before we landed, we were playing peak-a-boo around the seat.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry about the people on the airplane, I've seen a lot of kids traveling with parents. Some nice, some not so nice, and I've never seen another person say anything to mom or dad. Just plan for a great time with your son. <br>  <br>  I would never tell you not to take your child on a plane. I like that you're including him. Not all parents do that any more. My daughter has flown with both of her daughters, and she takes lots of coloring things(The magic wonder coloring), a couple stuffed toys(one of their favorite toys), and plenty of snacks. She found out if they keep busy eating, they don't want to run around. Personally, I think my granddaughters like to fly, because they get a few extra snacks, lol. The first time she flew with her older daughter, the baby was 14 months old....so, don't give up hope.<br>  <br>  I don't know about the pics, but you could always ask the flight attendants. <br>  <br>  I wish you a safe and fun trip with your child:).|`|3TcifNJNaa	i think it's perfectly normal to get up, walk around, and stretch your legs on a plane. i do it all the time, and i'm 13, but i've been doing it since i was little.|`|xIHgTqVhaa	I'm a former Flight Attendant and I fly a lot with my three children. <br>  <br>  Not only is it NOT rude but it's a great idea. People would rather *see* a toddler than *hear* him or her cry. Most people are parents themselves and know this is a difficult age. <br>  <br>  My 20 month old son once slept 20 minutes of an 11 1/2 hour flight, so yeah, we did a lot of walking on that one. Two of mine were very active toddlers. <br>  <br>  Just some tips;<br>  -Wait till the seat belt sign is off. <br>  -If the seat belt sign goes on, you need to get back to your seat BUT if it's super bumpy, don't attempt it if it's too dangerous. Jump in an empty seat, grab and handle and your child or even sit on the floor if standing is too risky. <br>  -Try to stay out of the aisles during the meal service. Those carts are the perfect height to hide toddlers.<br>  -Stay with him the whole time. Don't let him run off by himself (kind of a no-brainer but still...)<br>  -Do not go into a different class of service. I've had F/A's bark at me just for passing through the galley when a meal service wasn't going on.<br>  -Don't let him run around with food and drink.<br>  <br>  Some will stop and smile at him. Others will obviously not want to be disturbed so make sure whomever he's interacting with is a willing participant. <br>  <br>  I recommend that he have his own seat and that you bring slippers. Bulkhead seats are also a good idea as he wont disturb anyone in front of you but these are popular seats. <br>  <br>  I follow my childrens' cues. Do not wake him for take-off and landing to make him drink (this is a myth). Do not keep him from snacking. Keep him fed, watered and let him sleep when he needs it during the journey. Be a Good Mom when you get there but let things slide while in transit. <br>  <br>  When my son stayed up for so long, he had slept two hours to the airport and an hour from. Was it tiring for me? Yes, but he wasn't screaming or throwing fits. He was quiet and happy. What else could I ask for? It's a tough age...<br>  <br>  As far as photos, just ask the crew. You're more likely to get them at the end of the flight so don't dash off the plane if you want some. They'll give you whatever goodies that budget cuts haven't cut out!<br>  <br>  For more information, nine years ago I wrote an article on this subject. It's based on both my personal and professional experience of flying with kids. It's totally non-commercial and other parents from around the world have contributed;<br>  <a href="http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  An edited version appeared on the Expat Women website in December;<br>  <a href="http://www.expatwomen.com/mothers/flying_with_children.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.expatwomen.com/mothers/flying...</a><br>  <br>  Hawaii is so beautiful and kid-friendly.

Also, noise can be a concern, many people can't stand crying children on flights (some is OK, just not the entire flight), which I know is largely out of your control, but just be aware.  There are people who will be annoyed by any sign of someone that young on their flight, but they should be a minority, most people from my experience are OK with it as long as he's not unreasonably noisy or bothersome.  People get up and walk around all the time on long flights, even with young children, so it's generally not a concern.  Please be especially considerate of anyone sitting next to you.|`|vHwoWtBmaa	Well, I am not a mom or anything, but I think it would be fine. I don't think people will mind at all. They will probably think he is cute and talk to him or something. I think as long as you don't let him bother other people then you should be fine with him on the plane. You should bring stuff to entertain him too.

DRaq0kz9aa	Sydney is a great place to live.  Great beaches, nightlife and friendly people.  But yes it has been hit by unemployment in my opinion as has the rest of Australia.  Australia isn't technically in recession yet but could be come June. However, Australia is doing a lot better than most of it's trading partners (7/10 are in recession already).  <br>  <br>  The Federal government is giving every Australian taxpayer $950 in the next few weeks which I am looking forward to :)))) but don't particuarly think is going to stimulat anything worthwhile.<br>  <br>  Sydney has a rent shortage at present which has increased rental properties to exhorbitant prices and hard to get unless you have good pay or are cashed up.  Better of sharing with people in the same situation as yourself such as fellow students.  <br>  <br>  The NSW Gov't rather usless, as a matter a fact I haven't heard from them in a long time (thanks for reminding me).|`|DqmMW2tcaa	Sydney is a great place to live with the harbour and beaches.

You can ride ONLY if you have a wrist band|`|zyUfLvF5aa	Well, sort of. Eventually they will find you and kick you out. The food closes up except for a few fast food stands, such as the one in tomorrowland. The shops are closed fairly fast after park closing, but are normally open until about 30 mins after the park offically closes, but as you know, you don't need to be out exactly at closing. At the rides, you have to show your room key in order to go on the rides. The Disney Room keys are original, so they are the only ones that will get you in. Also, not every ride is open during extra magic hours, only specific ones, the most popular ones. So in the end, no you can't stay for extra magic hours and shop/eat. Well you could eat, but not much of it. I really suggest staying at a Disney Resort, because you also get the free transportation/free parking. Plus, no resort or hotel/motel is better than Disney. Have a magical day!

AJXyQa17aa	When you say best - you need to define if you mean most expensive, low crime rate, private schools etc etc...<br>  <br>  Dalkeith is probably one of the most expensive suburbs to live in, with house prices starting at 1.5 million AUD... however they also have a high rate of crime "per capita" - but if you're looking for classy then this is the place to be (Close to Subiaco, Mosman Park, Claremont - known for their niche shops... and also close to university of western australia) <br>  <br>  If you would like to live in an affluent suburb, and money is no issue - I would suggest looking at Mount Lawley, Maylands, Highgate, North Perth - all north of the city (5-10 minute drive) but surrounded by culture, private schools and have low crime rates.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to live south of the river - again with no cost as issue - I'd try Fremantle, Bicton, Applecross, Rossmoyne.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to live near the beach (once again, very pricey) try Cottesloe, Scarborough (high crime rate per capita), Hillarys (sorrento), Mullaloo ... and even further north, Mindarie<br>  <br>  Try looking at www.reiwa.com; they have a link where you can search suburbs with median price etc - you can also type in a search for houses, prices starting at 1.5 million...and these will give you a good indication of the wealthier suburbs.<br>  <br>  No telephone poles? Good luck... perth is still pretty backward :) <br>  <br>  Best of luck with this one! :)|`|Lt8UFEIoaa	I live in Ellenbrook, and there is underground power lines there, its a great community there, everything is close by, the suburb is less than ten years old so everything is nice and new!!!|`|uG8yLnUWaa	Don't know where some of these people live, there are no telephone poles or power lines (above ground that is) where I live in the northern suburbs.<br>  <br>  I live in a suburb called Ocean Reef. It is about 20 mins from the CBD on the coast. It is not a partucularily modern suburb, but there are pockets of new development scatterec throughout. The next suburb up, Iluka, is a newer suburb. Still on the coast with no aboveground power/phone lines. Amenities and facilities are in neighbouring suburbs, iluka is striclty residential. Great parks and open space.<br>  <br>  When you say classy people, not 100% sure what that means. Even the richest suburbs are not all classy - Just Google Rose Hancock Porteous and you will understand......|`|7RbootLlaa	Some say, Cottesloe (Beach), Dalkeith, Nedlands, Northbridge. As for no telephone poles - yeh right. They all have them. Classy people??? LMAO.... Just because these are the money suburbs, does not mean they are classy.<br>  Paramount houses - well to tell the truth a lot of suburbs across the board have them. Mirrabooka is a crap suburb, but gee the new housing estates they have built there in the last 20 years - the houses are mansions. Mirrabooka has a high crime rate, it's central to other high crime rate suburbs, burgularies are high there also, but people move there and I don't know why?|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Cottesloe it has beautiful beaches great places to eat ,a wonderful pub, nice houses but Alan Bond lives there so I don't know about the classy people bit.|`|k2vvT6glaa	Leeming!<br>  <br>  not really- I just live there...

AA10254694	If an election was called what is left of Thaksin's supporters would be elected along with others who support the populist agenda of Thaksin.  The current regime installed by the rouge corrupt Bangkok PAD would be kicked out of leadership.  No one has to pay the people in the North or Notheast to support ideas which helped to improve their lives and incomes.  That is propaganda made up to support robbing the poor people in the north and south by the rich Chinese running Thailand from Bangkok.<br>  <br>  Of course the Police and Military are part of the corruption and so it will be hard to have a stable Government when they are in the pocket of the Chinese merchants and elitist inteligista. Thus the seat of Government should be moved to<br>  a more centralized location.|`|yC55lotMaa	Supposed to be Isan Thai (easterners) and Northerners to still support him and his nominee party.<br>  But in Central, Bangkok and south, it will be others parties.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bangkokview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bangkokview.com</a><br>  <a href="http://tourthaionline.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://tourthaionline.blogspot.com</a>|`|8eb45b4c6ee01d5f00ffcb946d4ea1d1aa	yes he is supported by the rural poor.

For better or worse, and I think for better than the alternatives, elections are a popularity contest and one way to be popular is putting money in peoples pockets. In the US the republicans generally cut taxes for the rich and the middle class; the (US) Democrats generally promise funding for social programs for the poor. Its just in Thailand, it appears, that sometimes the cash incentive is given up front rather than at the back end. Its inappropriate of course but some sort of democracy is better than none. <br>  <br>  A slightly dodgy businessman is one thing; there are plenty of dodgy businessmen in politics in lots of countries. However, dissolving the political party that won the last election (and the previous three) and replacing it with a coalition headed by minority party, rather than having new elections, is, some might say, pretty much off the reservation in terms of international standards.<br>  <br>  I couldn't help noticing the government giving away Bhat2,000 each to government workers recently. Which way do government workers, who tend to be the educated elite and many of whom live in or near Bangkok (solid Democrat territory), tend to vote? Tick tok.<br>  <br>  With what happened with Prachatai last week I imagine that this sort of software is becoming more popular in Thailand.<br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/ProxyWay-Pro-Anonymous-Surfing/3000-2144_4-10495309.html?tag=mncol" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/ProxyWay-Pro-Ano...</a><br>  <br>  There is a remark on this page about the intelligentsia being PAD supporters. It isn't true as a broad brush statement; some are some aren't. The newspapers have had plenty of articles about academics being hounded by PAD supporters. Many academics signed a petition against the lese majesty law recently which has put them on a collision course with the government. The government has accused 'the academics' of having a 'hidden agenda' by opposing that law.<br>  <br>  I don't have much about the Chinese business aspect. In the US many big businesses make donations to both parties (donations list are publically available on the interest). It wouldn't surprise me if businesses in Thailand played both sides - just to be safe.|`|4e5d4a1a7ed268b398e3f6a34abdba78aa	Thaksin' s popularity in the northeast is largely based on the fact that he buys their votes.

This is an option to get your foot in the door, strictly phone work, stressful, yes, but it's not in your face, customer service and the overtime pays well.

YBbumuyFaa	Tang-Tubo Alliance or Sino-Tibetan Friendship Treaty of 821/823 A.D is one of the major arguments cited by the Tibetans that Tibet was historically not a part of China but a separate country.<br>  <br>  Here is the mention of the treaty on wikipedia.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Tibet#The_Great_Sino-Tibetan_Peace_Treaty_of_821.2F822" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a><br>  <br>  A monument was raised at the Jokhang Temple in Central Lhasa to commemorate the treaty between the two kingdoms of Tibet and China.<br>  <br>  I think, this is the image  file<br>  <a href="http://image46.webshots.com/46/9/30/92/342593092GAxDsL_fs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://image46.webshots.com/46/9/30/92/3...</a>|`|yJ4AJnrgaa	Never heard about this. I checked the wiki link provided by the first poster.<br>  <br>  Looks like China is guilty of breaking the peace treaty. Another example of imperialistic designs of Chinese Emperors.|`|asaLj4BTaa	I found one<br>  <a href="http://zhihai.heshang.net/picture/UploadFiles/200609/20060922094034808.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://zhihai.heshang.net/picture/Upload...</a><br>  The monument is more than 1100 years old. It is called 唐蕃会盟 in chinese.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Tibet became part of china after 200 years  the monument was erected, this monument imply the hostility between chinese and tibetan ended ever since that time.<br>  I reread some history about this, emperor taizhong of tang lived in 599-649, this monument is erected in 823, so emperor taizong had nothing to do with the monument. And at the age of emperor taizong and sungtson gompo, tibetan contributed lots of money or goods to tang dynasty every year,  obvious, sungtson gambo is defeated, not emperor taizong.
dd3gCaNHaa	sorry you were in a hospital and hope you're feeling much better and that everything is ok now.<br>  all non gov. hospitals i've been to or visited in jeddah don't have any segregation, even the so called "segregated" waiting rooms always seemed "mixed".<br>  there are saudi male and female doctors as well as saudi male and female nurses (they are growing in numbers each year) working side by side and with all the foreign doctors and nurses. i've heard it's not quite the same in other cities of the kingdom (guess if they are more strict in everything else thier hospitals would be too) depending on what the majority of people prefer i assume. i went to a couple of hospitals in khobar, from my experience, it was more chaotic and far from professional in terms of: answering phones, making appointments, general inquiry, waiting rooms, calling patients, paper work and follow up. doctors i've seen ranged from "ok" to "discounted bundle rushed treatments" kind of docs! so, for any major or significant medical issues i would go to jeddah.<br>  i personally don't think a husband can refuse critical treatment of his wife... by law hospitals should provide urgent treatment regardless...however, i've been shocked before by "lack" of "it's a no brainer" laws in my country and other arab countries so i guess i'll have to research this some more (even though i was married to a guy who worked in several hospitals before...)<br>  oh, a close relative of mine actually had plastic surgery without the knowledge or consent of her husband in one of jeddahs well known hospitals so i guess some procedures don't require the husbands "ok" because i'm sure that hospital won't risk it.|`|UhnvXXxjaa	there is no sex segregation in Saudi Hospitals, the only sex segregated place in hospitals is the waiting room/area. btw there are so many saudi female nurses.|`|XqfSDTKkaa	Well my sister the hospitals arent really segregated. The hospitals I've been to usually have men waiting rooms and womens waiting rooms. Some have mixed waiting rooms. However the hospital wards have female sections and male sections usually on different floors. If youre sleeping in the hospital it will be in a female only section and same applies for the men. If youre a female patient you will always have a female nurse, and same goes for men, usually a female nurse unless it's a more embarrassing procedure involving nudity then they'll get a male nurse.<br>  The male doctors/ women drs/ nurses all work together but are not to be alone with one another. If you are a female patient and seeing a male doctor, there is automatically a nurse sent to the room to act as a 3rd party so no funny business goes on.<br>   A lot of women see men doctors. however some families dont approve of this. I was told at a hospital that if I wanted a female OB I had to wait 5 months for an appointment. If I was willing to take a male OB I can have one in 2 weeks. A man has no right to deny his wife any medical treatment and she should complain to anyone she can. He can only deny that a man be the Dr. ( I assume) and in that case get her a qualified female Dr. However most men in grieve situations will let their woman see a male Dr. ( ie emergency room).<br>  Um, I dont think women take the maids to the hospital with them but its not like a rule that you cant....<br>   Hope I helped!!!!|`|mxIYhkAnaa	Salaamu alaikum wa Rahmatu Allaah, sister,<br>  <br>  As far as i can say ( Allaah has blessed me with a alhamdulillaah good health)  there was no need for me to make a visit a doctor, let aside the operation theater. Although i have been several times been in a hospital of Madeenah al Munnawarrah, because of the birth of my 2 children. Masha Allaah. <br>  <br>  So i would describe my answer based upon this 6 visits (controle before, the delivery itself and the after controle). I hope it doesn't sound general, but just my experience, insha Allaah.<br>  <br>  <br>  >>> How are male doctors working together with female nurses in i.e. the operation theater?<br>  <br>  I have seen (at my stay in the hospital after the deliver) that some female nurses are working with male doctors, but they are working with a complete hijaab (including the face) although some foreign nurses, covered up just their head (excluding the face). It was how can i say that, based upon the beliefs of the nurses (about the niqaab) and what there nationality was. Foreign nurses worked there just because there was "need" for.. There aren't many Saudi sisters working as nurses in the total visits i have seen 3 but working only with the female doctor and still covering up their faces (because of my husband precense (he had to translate sometimes)). <br>  <br>  Basically if there is a need (operation is a need, i think), there is a premission to mix, but it is preferred not to... But yet since there aren't male nurses.. It is really difficult...<br>  <br>  Can female nurses treat men?<br>  <br>  As far i have seen, yes, if the nurses are foreign, mostly they have no problem with it. Saudi nurses, no, as far as i know and have spoken with, no, in the most case of emerengy, they would call the foreign nurses up to work more hours...... Even my female doctor (out of Syria) is been called out of her bed, to make the delivery, with the result she came when i was 15 minuts before i was done... <br>  <br>  Can women be treated by male Docs/Gynecologists?<br>  <br>  As far i have seen, she was one of the two female doctors that helped. Although above them is a male doctor specialisted, so if something went wrong (with the delivery) i had to go under a operation, my husband has given his premission for that the male doctor could take over and see my auwrah and belly (i would be covered up under a sheet) and my husband would not leave me alone during the operation..<br>  <br>  If a husband refuses to give his wife permission for medical treatment, what is she suppose to do? <br>  <br>  Hmm, Sabr? Even serious, like i said above, my husband gave my premission, and he is one of the most pious (others would call it radical), masha Allaah. The wise, makes his decision based upon the facts... If he would not give me premission, he would make the risk of losing our baby. If i had the flu ( or something that isn't medical or religious need for to visit a male doctor) he would not give me premission and would search a other hospital to search a female doctor.... Untill she is found, the wife has to make sabr.... A lot of men, undermind the health and/or sabr of their wives... Many stories has reached the newspaper... A good husband could make the balance between "need" and "ask" and he would know the sabr level of his wife (can she wait (perform sabr) medically and spiratually an other hour/day/ week?).. If the wive speaks honestly to her husband, they can find a way out. <br>  <br>  Do Saudi ladies take their maids with them to the hospital also?<br>  As far i have seen, yes, sadly, (i am agianst this trend, showing off you can offord (with money) a house maid), most men hasn't learned to take care of their family (let aside themselves).. Long happy life with the Mac Donalds.... "I'm loving it" the slogan is totally applied to the Saudi people... Sadly...<br>  <br>  Salaamu alaikum wa Rahmatu Allaah.|`|WIEH455laa	There is no segregation is Hospitals other than waiting rooms. Female doctors and nurses can treat men and vis versa. Yes, women can be treated by a OBGYM, no need for husband consent for medical treatments. <br>  <br>  Most don't take their maids. There are Female Saudi doctors as well, who work side by side with male doctors. <br>  Saudi doctors and nurses don't wear an Abaya (over coat), some wear long skirts, some wear scrubs (pants/white coat) some wear a long white coat to their feet.|`|54pPOC5Caa	There is no segregation of the sexes at all at Saudi hospitals except for waiting rooms as hamad mentioned. Female nurses treat both sexes, male and female doctors treat both sexes with no regulations regarding this matter what so ever. There are lots of female Saudi nurses by the way, some of whom cover their faces with burgu3 with no problems. And yes, there are Saudi male gynecologists, in fact the famous gynecologists are mostly male.|`|nzwYJbEFaa	i have alot of saudi friends that happen to be nurses i women can b treated by  a male obgyn but they r very few male ones here i see lots and  lots of maids in hospitla mostly the ped section|`|cypZ0ykXaa	donno 'bout other things but in islam its acceptable for a female to consult a male doc when therz no other go.|`|AA12350023	yes. as they say.. no segregation..<br>  my first attending gynocologist was a male doctor (a US doctor) here in Saudi, but he was off the weekend I delivered, so the attending doctor assigned to me just happened to be a very good lady docter from Pakistan. She was excellent.. <br>  there were male and female nurses attending to my deliever (I had a c-section) I can remember all of them..<br>  Though the rooms where I was recovering in, was all women on that wing and the attending nurses were all female.. <br>  but I know when visiting other friends and relatives in the hospital there are male and females on the same wing and male/female staff also.. <br>  <br>  when I make an appointment, the receptionist asks me if I prefer male or female doctor.. if the female is booked far in advance I just take the next available doc and sometimes its a male.. I know some women are funny about this, but I guess being raised in the west. I personally dont care.. <br>  .... yes some women take their maids with them to the hospital. those that need assistance or in wheelchairs etc..<br>  but the hospitals ive gone to, now post signs asking the patients to not bring well children or maids in if you absolutely dont have to.. cause they take up too much room/chairs in the waiting area for those that need it.. and the kids run all over wrecking havoc playing. and also well children can catch colds from the sick kids there.. <br>  its better now, but I remember around 10years or so ago.. seemed women would bring in all 7 kids like it was a picnic or outing.. their kids would have bags of chocolate and drink boxes, chips and eating and munching, running all over, smearing juice, soda , chocolate all over the chairs, making a mess for the cleaning staff, running in and out of the clinic, causing the nurses to have to police the children the mothers refused to do.. It was awful.. so they now are trying to get stricter with this..

36a3854c55b5983c72e9a4e1ff6ab816aa	Really depends on what kind of boats were talking about I guess. River Rhone is quite a big river and is navigable by quite big prom ships and even small cruise ships. But I cant remember that this river passes through Lake Geneva that is in close to the alps. Even if lake geneva is quite close to the mediteranean I dont think there is a direkt route throuw that sea and that you have to go through atlantic ocean or that sea across from Istanbul.<br>  <br>  Youre best bet is to try to contact local authorithes and ask. If theyre dont know they will recomend you to some that know. Johan.|`|pQqGmQ99aa	No.  LAKE Geneva, is a lake.  Lakes do not flow into the ocean, rivers do.  The Mediterranean is an ocean.  The do not meet, thus you can't cruise to each.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	I don't know exactly where Lake Geneva is, but you could have a travel agent set something up. It would be like a custom cruise tour. Many people do this, where you combine land and sea into a single vacation. Also, sometimes, you can book 2 concurrent cruises to come up with alternate destinations, depending on where you want to begin and end.
Y47WgY4Laa	What sort of horror stories have you heard? I went to university in central London and there were hundreds of international students all having a great time in London.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about gun crime / violence, don't be. Despite the impression you might get from the news, the violence is usually gang-related (so you're unlikely to get caught up in it) and tends to happen in rougher suburbs of London (where you don't need to go).<br>  <br>  Regarding personal safety: London is like any big city - you just need common sense to survive. Don't carry more cash than you need to; keep your valuables tucked away; make sure your laptop etc is insured (just in case!); and always get a taxi home if you're going to be out after midnight. This all sounds obvious but its what has kept me safe in London for over 10 years.<br>  <br>  What concerns you about London's nightlife? The bars and clubs in central London usually have good security, bouncers, cloakrooms for your bags, etc. If you don't get into trouble on a night out at home, there's no reason you'll run into any here. If you're worried, stick the student union bars or the places you feel comfortable. That said, it would be a shame to miss out on London's great live music venues, jazz bars, comedy clubs, small theatres, etc.<br>  <br>  As the person above said, the only real danger in London is over-spending. Like other big cities, it's expensive but you can very easily adapt to living on a budget. (I can give you plenty of tips if you need any!) People forget that there are plenty of free things to do in London and that students are entitled to some great discounts.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying London is perfect, but I do think it's a great place to study. You will meet some incredible people from all over the world and have access to things that some people will never see - the galleries, museums, libraries, theatres, shops, restaurants and so on.<br>  <br>  If you've got any other questions, please feel free to ask :)<br>  <br>  Check out <a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/</a> and <a href="http://www.timeout.com/london/" rel="nofollow">http://www.timeout.com/london/</a> to get an idea of the things you can do while you're here.|`|DCYHglflaa	Wow, this is too broad a question. First, you can hear horror stories about anywhere--don't let people scare you.  It depends on where you go, and all the usual concerns of being safe. Use common sense. It should be a WONDERFUL experience for you---sounds like some people may be a bit envious of your opportunity and are trying to put you off the idea. <br>  <br>  the scariest part of living in London is the expense.

You can;t really get bored or anything.|`|l4jSgRRmaa	Do a google search "San Francisco sights."<br>  Some ideas are:<br>  China Town*<br>  Golden Gate Park (rent a bike)<br>  Fisherman's Wharf (see the seals)<br>  Japanese Tea Garden <br>  Exploratorium*<br>  Zoo<br>  Cable Car*<br>  Lombard Street (crooked one)<br>  Just looking at the houses is interesting <br>  Union Square<br>  Alcatraz Island (former prison)<br>  Sausalito (by ferry)<br>  Ghiradelli Square<br>  Pier 39<br>  Golden Gate Bridge <br>  Coit Tower<br>  <br>  Do not think there is something wrong with you if guys try to pick you up.

tQsxsuNPaa	Highly populated?  With Big Yellow shutting stuff down and downsizing and such...much less than when I lived there (big yellow being KODAK - formerly the largest employer in the area, and a stable job with a great benefits/retirement package.  No such thing as security any longer...with any business!)<br>  <br>  Much of the population has migrated to the southern part of the Metro area.  <br>  <br>  Crime Rate...depends on the area, as with any city, but it's pretty bad in the city.  Few middle class people have really ever lived IN the city...everyone (for the most part) lives in the suburbs...again, like most cities in the US.<br>  <br>  Climate...changing.  My mom says they hardly ever get much snow anymore...I remember storms!  And they almost NEVER close the schools!  I used to walk through blizzards!  But you still never see the sun!<br>  <br>  Businesses:  Kodak, Xerox, Gleason Works (no idea what they do) Bausch and Lomb, and Alliance Tool and Die (they make stuff like car parts, I think) are all big employers, there.  There are TONS of smaller industrial things, too. <br>  <br>  Activities...Ummm....that's a huge part of why I moved away!  We used to ski in the winter...big (:)) ski areas are Bristol, and Swain.  Several are a little further away, but those are the two within about an hour, that most people ski.  Ice skating used to be big.  There is a large county-wide parks and rec department that runs a bunch of skating rinks, some pools, you know...Most of the schools there have HUGE varieties of sport for the kids, and there are a number of private clubs...a gym, pools, things of that nature...there's a beach.  They closed it down in the mid 60s due to pollution, opened it up again in 1981 or so...not because it was less polluted, but because it was safer, overall, to have a lifeguard there.  Boating, both on the river and on the lake, and in Irondequoit Bay.   Small amusement park, officially called Dreamland, but the locals know it as Seabreeze.  The beach is in Charlotte, and there's an antique carousel there. <br>  <br>  Greater Rochester is home to three of the top public high schools in the state. <br>  <br>  What, EXACTLY are you looking for?   I could probably go on, but if you email me...I can give you more specifics...let me know sort of what you're writing...cause I'd be better help for what it USED to be like, as in, if your characters GREW UP there, I can give you better details for their backgrounds...cause I haven't LIVED there in about 25 years!

It's like anywhere else I guess, be vigilant and safety conscious.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|s2IOyj8iaa	They are reasonably safe . One must be alert of course . The train driver has a camera he can see what is going on in any of the carriages so if something is out of order he can phone Police and they will be waiting at the next stop. Most people are good people . I wouldn't be afraid .although you do hear of the occasional story it is not common for trouble.|`|FxFqg5Qhaa	I live on the northside too and used to regularly take trains and buses. As a 20yo female i am always wary using any form of public transport after dark. I would personally feel safer on a bus than train - often on trains at night there may be only you and a few others on one carriage - a lot can happen between stations!! Worst case scenario of course, but it does happen. During peak hour and during the day I never have a second thought of using the trains though. There have been quite a few assaults/stabbings/sexual assaults/robberies at train stations over the last year here in brisbane after dark though. <br>  <br>  Also during the weekends a lot of the night trains have a security guard patrolling the trains, when you look at the timetable it will have a little symbol or something letting you know which lines have the guards on and when. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|2MP9nYLdaa	nowhere is safe now
ipw5zYZYaa	Best way to pronouce Zheng would be to think of the word, "sung."  Now, use a "j" . . . "jung" and you have a close approximation.  The downward accent over the "e" means you are going to drop your voice . . . very similar to the end of a sentence (as opposed to a rising tone at the end of a question).  <br>  <br>  The "e" by itself is more like "uh"<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	Zheng is pronounces as Jen in Jennifer...<br>  the sign above "e" shows the 4th tone...|`|1LlhqADoaa	"eng" is a single whole in chinese pinyin.<br>  don't concern about "e" <br>  here a source.You can learn how to pronounce "eng".|`|fNV8oDLKaa	You can't separate the è from -èng.<br>  Zhèng pronounce like gen- of gentle.|`|FUyAN0aLaa	zh- er -nnnnn......|`|scgZqOn0aa	its like:<br>  renèè or like ay in the word sway

YGSstaiEaa	The biggest difference is the rent.<br>  The rent in Tokyo area is much expensive.<br>  Grocery is another one that makes living cost different, but not like as rent.<br>  However if you live in a country side, you will probably need to own a car to move around. (train and busy system in Tokyo is excellent)<br>  <br>  For example, living in a studio type of apartment in Tokyo would cost 70,000 yen or so while it would cost around 40,000 - 50,000 yen in a country side.<br>  and price for gas/water/electricity are also different depending on where you live.

First for taxi's to Bangkok from the airport there is a small building outside on the curb that has a line where you wait for the next taxi.  If you do not go there you will be taken for a very expensive ride by a driver that is trying to tell you he will get you to the city.  Your fare should not be more that 180baht.  If it is more than that you have been taken advantage of.  Make Sure you get a Metered cab every time you get into a cab and that he resets it when you start to roll away from the curb.<br>  <br>  I stay at the Key Hotel most of the time.  It is inexpensive, and convenient to the rail systems.  Making the need for a taxi limited.<br>  enjoy|`|7MDe2OO0aa	a. Public Taxi in different color, could be green&yellow , blue , pink , orange etc. Always goes with the driver who open Taxi and do not trust or go with any guy who approach you and ask if you want a taxi. Sometimes they brought you a car which is not a taxi and over charge you. Average price from Airport to Downtown is 300 Baht. Toll way is 70 Baht.<br>  <br>  b. If you just come for stop over, can try the hotel near airport that offer free round trip airport transfer like Silver Gold Garden. But if you wish to see the city , shopping or have a city tour, look for hotel near sky train is the best choise. e.g. The Heritage Bangkok, Asia Hotel or Pathumwan princess ( this one is right in the shopping center ). Or you can check for some promotion offer for Bangkok Package for a good deal.|`|jxCS9DToaa	Taxi fare ie metered taxi should be about 400 baht depends if the taxi uses the express way or not.  Good hotel Nana Plaza 500 Baht, or Nana Grand about 2,000 Baht|`|CMHpeeqGaa	You should have a look on <a href="http://www.everythinglink.com/productlist.php?q=bangkok&rb=4-328" rel="nofollow">http://www.everythinglink.com/productlis...</a> they have a load on there.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	Are you asking about Général de Gaulle, who organised resistance to the Germans in London during WW2 and later became President of the French republic? Or do you want to know about the international airport called after him?<br>  <br>  Charles  de Gaulle<br>  Born: 22 November 1890 <br>  Birthplace: Lille, France <br>  Died: 9 November 1970 (aneurysm) <br>  Best Known As: President of France, 1958-69 <br>  Charles de Gaulle was the dominant political leader and grand figurehead of France during and after World War II. De Gaulle was a career soldier in the French Army who had been wounded and held prisoner during World War I. He rose to the rank of general and was serving as France's minister for National Defense and War in June, 1940, when France capitulated to Germany early in World War II. DeGaulle escaped to Britain, where he made a famous broadcast calling on the French people to resist (earning him the nickname of the "Man of June 18, 1940"). DeGaulle formed the Free French forces and led the provisional government that ruled France after it was retaken from Germany. After the war he was elected head of the French government, but left the post in 1946 and formed a new political party, the Rassemblement du Peuple Francais (Rally of the People of France, or RPF). DeGaulle was in and out of politics until 1958, when he was called to form a government amid political chaos in France. He oversaw the constitutional reforms that led to the Fifth Republic of France, and became the first president of the new Republic in 1959. Proud, stubborn, and charismatic, he insisted on France's right to pursue an independent path from both Europe and the United States. He also settled France's difficult relations with its Algerian territory by granting self-determination to Algeria. He served as president for just over a decade until stepping down in April of 1969.<br>  <br>  If you want more detailed information you can read about him on this website:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_...</a><br>  <br>  If what you want to know about is the airport, it is located North of Paris and is also known locally as Roissy.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_International_Airport" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_...</a>
