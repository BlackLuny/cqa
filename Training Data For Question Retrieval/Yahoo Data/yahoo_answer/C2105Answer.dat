cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Don't confuse rating and voting for best answer. Anyone can vote for best answer.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up/down is called rating and is available starting at level 2. It indicates what you think of an answer not necessarily the best. The person getting best answer gets an additional point for each thumbs up. Thumbs down does not affect points.<br>  <br>  The person receiving the best answer receives 10 points. It can be selected by the asker or put to a vote. To choose a best answer do one of the following. If the question is yours you can select a best answer after 4 hours. You will have 4 days to do it. If it is someone else's question you will have to wait 4 days if the asker does not pick it himself. There will be a "vote as best answer" button.

This is something you can either do or you can't, but don't fret, just concentrate.<br>  <br>  The interview will have questions based around the spheres of interest.<br>  These include your time-keeping, ability to work as a team and as well as alone, any experience you have had handling money or high value items, any past positions of responsibility and any time when you've had to maintain confidentiality in a professional capacity.<br>  <br>  Don't rush and stammer in your answers. Think a second before, but without appearing too hesitant. Be truthful, and use examples from your life. It may be your first job, in which case, you can use examples from school, college, volunteer work in any capacity, even helping old ladies across streets, as long as you can make it strictly relevant to the job at hand.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Email me through this is you wish - I'd be curious to know which office your going for and how you get on.

suPD7c3gaa	Oh dear.  I feel so badly for you.  Once the recycle bin is emptied, there would be no way to get those photos back.  In the future, invest in the little memory disks for your camera.  That way you save those like you would CD's, with no real reason to delete right away.  You should have several of them, so that there's always a blank one.<br>  <br>  But first you said you "think" you deleted the pictures from your computer.  Then you said you accidentally deleted them.  Be sure you've done a search.  Maybe they are just not where you thought you put them.  <br>  <br>  Another bit of advice.  Don't be so quick to empty your Recycle Bin.  I always keep things I delete there ("Trash" on a Mac) for at least a few weeks, if not longer in case I find out later I've deleted something I hadn't intended to delete.  Never empty it as soon as you put something in it.  That's always when unintended deletions like this happen.<br>  <br>  Hope you find them!|`|el8yX5q3aa	WOW...I have done that...but now I back up everything on an external hard drive and on disks.  There are also several online hard drives you can use...or upload to photobucket and fill that up..you can have as many accounts as you want....but one holds oodles of pics.<br>  <br>  I also did a family webpage and it holds my 9000 pics on that...so if I lose them....I just download them again.  But not everyone is going to do a family page to hold pics.  :)))<br>  <br>  I also have a special google email account...family emails pics to that account and I upload mine there too and create folders and they are saved there.  Google email has tons of space.....<br>  <br>  It isn't just my pictures though either...so I have oodles more that aren't on there!  It is the family pictures throughout the U.S.  But those are safe as long as I keep up the webpage.  :)))<br>  <br>  THANK GOD I just uploaded mine on photobucket and on the external...as my computer just crashed and I had to reformat.  I only lost a couple things I needed...or updated...but the majority of it was there.<br>  <br>  I did about 12 hours more on the family tree and lost that...but thank God the four months of typing was saved.  I can deal with 12 hours!<br>  <br>  Backup....never shut down without backup.....learned that lesson a couple times.<br>  <br>  Also...firefox has a new program called foxmarks.  It will back up your bookmarks so you NEVER lose them either.  Each day I hit sync and it automatically does that.  If I ever lose my browser...I can get my photos.<br>  <br>  Also...Microsoft has a 25 gig hard drive you can have free of charge....<br>  upload to that.....it is called SKY DRIVE...and it is pretty neat.

Classic mail.  You simply look to the very upper right of your mail page.  You'll either see the link for All-New Mail, or Yahoo! Mail Classic.  Click on that link, and you will be on your way to switching over.  Again... you can easily switch back and forth at any time.  Personally, I don't care for the All-New version of Yahoo! mail, but it does have one feature I'm particularly fond of that Classic doesn't have. That is you can delete ALL emails in your In-Box, not just one page at a time as is the case with Classic.  So I'll switch over to delete several pages of emails in one click, and then swtich back to Classic.|`|0imjbygmaa	There's some button on the top of your yahoo mail that says switch back to class, and then you say yes.|`|c8f77ec6dbbf045e46b3bc02399a996caa	at the top of the screen after your name and Sign Out there is a link which says All-New Mail or go to Options - Mail Options, there is one there.

It's glaringly obvious you can choose the category at that point in the process... but some just can't figure that out.  So instead of blaming their own lack of common sense (she says kindly), they blame Y!A.   There are also some people who specifically state they don't care what category their questions go in.

Residence in a province or territory is the basic requirement for insured health care coverage. The Canada Health Act defines a resident of a province or territory as:<br>  <br>  "a person lawfully entitled to be or to remain in Canada who makes his home and is ordinarily present in the province, but does not include a tourist, a transient or a visitor to the province."<br>  <br>  Each province and territory is responsible for determining its own minimum residence requirements with regard to an individual's eligibility for benefits under its health insurance plan. The Canada Health Act gives no guidance on such minimum residence requirements beyond an initial three-month waiting period to establish eligibility for and entitlement to insured health services. Provinces may require minimum residence annually in the province, and evidence of intention of returning to the province for that minimum residence period each year.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

AA11307940	That would be nice, just like questions and answers, it pops up to tell us we are wrong, unfortunately in Yahoo mail classic, we have to click on the spell checker ourselves.

For me though it would distract my train of thought if it were to pop up while I'm typing.

When Yahoo detects that you’ve already signed into Yahoo Mail, it will disconnect you when you try to sign into messenger or vice versa - hence the message that you are signed in to another computer. To get rid of your problem simply disable chat in your mail (!) account by clicking the smiley and following the prompts.

suPD7c3gaa	I can't understand much of what you've said here, but If this is something you did online, you fell for a scam.  No site gives away prizes just because you filled something out.  I bet you didn't even look, before you gave them any of your personal details, to see if the page you were using to fill in that information was a secure (SSL certified) site.  If there were no terms on this bulletin... why wouldn't you have been suspicious right then and there?  Whenever you see something online that's offering money or prizes like you mention, and you have to fill out personal information... you need to know IT'S A SCAM.  No one MADE you fill out that information.  You did it of your own free will.

IsxB0Qi7aa	Underneath your question you see the 3 boxes that say: Interesting, Email & Edit. Under Edit the 3rd choice down it says Delete Question. If it has gone to voting or a best answer has already been chosen, then it is too late, you can't delete it.|`|F0h2iFWsaa	You can only delete questions that you asked, and you can only do that while they are still 'open'. Once a question is in 'voting' or has been resolved via a Best Answer being chosen, the question belongs to Y!A and is in their database forever (or until they start archiving old Q&As anyway).<br>  <br>  To delete your question while it's still open, go to the question page, pass your mouse over the pencil icon in the toolbar below your question, and click Delete Question.<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/ask/ask-76322.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a>|`|e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	I don't know how to delete your own question, but if you want to delete someone else's question because it violates the guidelines (inappropriate content, etc.) you can hit the "report abuse" button and check off the reason you want to report abuse. If you are a user in good standing usually your recommendation will be followed and the question will be deleted. (especially if you're not the only user who reports the inappropriate question.)|`|e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	For your own questions...<br>  <br>  Only open questions may be deleted. Once they are in voting or resolved, they become the property of Yahoo and go to their archives. They even stay there if you quit YA entirely. <br>  To delete an open question go to your profile, go to "my questions". Click on the question you wish to delete, underneath it click "+", then click "delete question".|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Use the PENCIL  under the question to delete OPEN questions. Only YA can delete resolved questions, generally as violations. Or, you can hide Q&A by clicking "Edit My Info" next to your avatar on the Profile page, then change settings under PRIVACY.|`|ODYrypwaaa	After you have posted a quetion, pull it up on your profile, click on the pencil icon and there should be an option for delete.
2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	There are 2 sites that I think you might mean -- AskJud and PeterAnswers. They are both 'fake psychic' sites or 'robot' sites. They work using a trick.

zDQIPFH2aa	Google maps does it as do several others, but not all parts of the country have been completed.  You may find your street has not been done, but a block away they have done the houses.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Go to any search site and type in 'Streetview' maps -- several sites link to it or present it in different ways.|`|L6ZEQxvLaa	google maps still does, doesn't it?<br>  <br>  ♀♂
ncCWnApDaa	A suspension is permanent unless you successfully appeal it, while winning appeals is rare its not impossible.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Just so you know, suspended accounts don't have all their Q&A removed. Only the ones that violated the rules are removed. So any answers that are still out there in voting can end up getting Best Answers, as you've seen.<br>  <br>  There IS another type of 'suspension', though, where ALL Q&A vanish, as if they never existed. This one usually causes the email account to disappear as well. You have to make a BIG mistake for this to happen.|`|suPD7c3gaa	Most of the time, as has been said, suspensions are permanent.  You're getting Best Answer notices because your answers haven't gone away... just your access to your account.  So you could still get Best Answer notices and even violation notices.|`|fox5a3ePaa	Its permanent im afraid.|`|haTvOeacaa	It is permanent.|`|rrkmmbnEaa	Permanent - just create another email account.|`|UWv3Qx4Gaa	finito|`|a2708e7f671d2c5308a7fca7225d05d4aa	Accounts are suspended forever <br>  unless you appeal within a 1 week time frame <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/first_appeal.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a><br>  a person can appeal only once.<br>  In the appeal make sure you are polite <br>  stay on focus if you can make sure you mention the reason why the account got suspended <br>  don't mention things that are off topic <br>  don't threaten the appeal board<br>  the appeal board is for appealing only and not for abuse.<br>  If a person wins their appeal their account will be re-instated<br>  their influence boosted<br>  get any points if lost, back<br>  <br>  If there is a loss at the appeal the account will remain suspended <br>  and the person will lose another 10 points.
2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Sorry, it can't be done. You have to ask it again, this time making sure it goes to the correct category before you finally submit it for posting. You can either leave the old one where it is -- or delete it using the 'edit' feature (pencil) under it while it is still open. No additional points will be lost if you do this, but you will also not get BACK your 5 points, either.|`|a2708e7f671d2c5308a7fca7225d05d4aa	Before one posts their question <br>  one needs to preview <br>  once for possible spelling mistakes or grammar<br>  Another previewing to check what category to place your question<br>  if you post your question and suddenly realize its in the wrong category <br>  Then its too late.<br>  Always check everything over <br>  that I mentioned above.|`|aa9e4f65153be65e413d2ff21b91c4d6aa	When you repost it, there's a tab to choose the category yourself.

f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	We have unlimited storage with Yahoo, so you don't have to worry about it. It's been like that for over a year, now.

AA11228933	What can you do? I wrote an innocuous story about my dog. It was in answer to someone asking for their group that needed an upbeat little story because they feeling a "little down" that day.<br>  After posting it I checked back the next day to see both the question and the uplifting story- GONE! <br>  Where? Why? What do you do? There is no place to inquire is there?<br>  Whomever oversees this YA should have the decency to explain. It's no big deal really. It would only improve the trust and respect for the YA community overseers. "Sneaky" comes to mind, or suspicious.|`|RhkKGsipaa	it seems very strange.  My suggestion,edit your info so your questions and answers aren't public,that way if some members are stalking you they won't have ready access to your posts.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_...</a>|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	If this is the one and only time this has happened to you, in almost 3 years with a WIDE open profile, I would not get into a huff about it, really. If it continues, you might want to check your RECENT fans, to see if someone 'suspicious' has just added themselves. This might be the problem. If the answers were not violations, obviously appeal them. But hiding yourself after all this time, just because of 2 violations, seems to be a bit of an over-reaction.
zDQIPFH2aa	Did it not post or was it quickly violated.  It would be a chat violation.  You can't ask about user's "feelings".  That is defined as chat on YA.  Unless there was more to it including a possible link, it should have posted.

t2M1kXY4aa	No, it won't "re-ask" the question or bump it back to the homepage ... you'll have to retype (or copy/paste) and resubmit the question (and lose another 5 points) if you want that to happen.<br>  <br>  "Extend expiration" simply allows the question to remain open longer, rather than automatically sending the question to voting if you don't choose a Best Answer.|`|f06Sy0dfaa	No, it doesn't. It just extends the date to where you are able to receive more questions.
eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	For your own questions.<br>  ==================<br>  You need to wait for 4 hours after you submit the question and then go back to the question, you will have a blue tab under each answer, "select as best answer", click the tab on the answer you consider to be the best. Rate the answer 1-5 stars, add a comment if you wish, click submit, you're done. 3 points back.<br>  <br>  For undecided questions.<br>  ===================<br>  Click "VOTE" on any Category. Pick a question, click on the question to open it. Select the answer you think is best. Click on "Vote as Best Answer". You have gained 1 point.|`|q48Wn25Saa	Four hours have to pass before you are able to give out a Best Answer. And when you can, there will be a big blue button beneath each answer.|`|suPD7c3gaa	For your own questions:<br>  <br>  Once your question has been posted for at least 4 hours, you will see the blue "Choose as Best Answer" button by each answer. After 4 hours have elapsed, just go to your question, then to the answer you want to choose, and click on that button, and follow the steps. If you haven't gotten the answer you need, you can give it a few more days just in case you get more answers, and one that might be better.<br>  <br>  Voting Undecided Questions (Other members' questions):<br>  <br>  Go to any category or sub-category and click on the "Vote Undecided questions" tab. Then click on questions to vote, look over the answers and click "Vote as Best Answer". Your vote will be counted, but the answer you voted for won't necessarily get the most votes. Do not allow your own questions to go to voting as you will be no control over which answer gets the most Best Answer votes.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	You can't do it right away.  After like 4 hours you can go back to your question and buttons will appear below each answer and you can select the answer you think is best, give it 1-5 stars and leave a comment about the answer.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Language or links will do it. In your case, I'm betting language. You might be getting some violation notices soon. You really need to read the rules carefully. Posting sexually explicit descriptions is NOT allowed on this site.<br>  <br>  Questions are prescreened for certain words and/or phrases, to help spot violations. Flagged questions are held for staff review. So some questions may not post for hours – or may get violated by staff. Delayed questions will be off the front page, so get very few answers.<br>  <br>  If you are posting questions with links in them, this can delay the question posting or even cause it to not post. To get around this, post the question without the link first, then return to the question and use the PENCIL under it to put the link in the ‘additional details’ section.|`|4di2FUSUaa	o idk im sry...y dont u post the question here?
