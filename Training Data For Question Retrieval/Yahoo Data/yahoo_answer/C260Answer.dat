pgbmuOniaa	yes the violence is cut back some as well as use of more mature language & swearing. also some of the things said in english are not accurate to what is said in japanese & the subtitles are almost a direct translation of whats being said. for instance when renji fought byakuya at the end in english he insulted renji but in japanese he congratulated his subordinate in his ability to force him to his knees by saying "your fangs indeed reached me". so it just gives you a more accurate idea of whats going on sometimes you get lost on things when its in english. but either one is still good. though i do prefer jap. over eng|`|6PSnZDhDaa	I agree with answer 1...

cgfE0yyzaa	Well, like the first season, they left open the ending of the second season again. You could call it a "cliffhanger ending". The light novel of Shakugan no Shana goes way beyond the ending of season 2, so they will always have the option to continue production of the anime.    As far as your question, I don't think Shana ever told Yuji about what she said at the end of season 1. He did forget/didn't remember about that moment. I don't want to spoil you for the enjoyment, but season 2 have a lot of harem moments (basically couple of girls jealous over the main guy). Though in the very end I would say there's a real brief development. I'd say you should check it out just for that cause it's worth seeing Shana's smile. ;)

He's probably just disappointed you aren't facebook messaging him.|`|ZuEbNOUeaa	Because SOME people are rude when it comes to emails and stuff.|`|rnzFaYM3aa	Most people would rather suffer though torturous interactions then rather disclose their true thoughts and feelings. Your friend may have either been too busy to respond, or just didn't want to seem cruel by telling you outright that he wasn't interested in talking to you. Best thing to do in either case is to not seem taken by it and give him some space to see what becomes.

xTioPxaVaa	Your're going to be pretty hard pressed to find a chord book for flutes.  Mainly because you can't play a chord on a flute!!  You might find music arranged for a flute duo, trio, or quartet.    The best thing you could probably do is to get piano music and transpose it for flute.      Greetings from Austin, TX    Ken
a919bfb9c4d207df3618510881d052d8aa	A good story isn't dictated by length, sometimes a shorter series can have much greater impact than a long, drawn-out one.    FullMetal Alchemist wasn't a faithful manga adaptation the first time around, but it was still amazing, some 50 episodes is as good as you might expect.  Check out-    Death Note (medium length- 37eps), Monster (long- 72 eps), Jigoku Shoujo (two seasons, with another upcoming, 50+ eps), Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (50 eps, two seasons), Bleach (this should be nice- plenty long, ep.205 just aired, but beware of fillers, though not as bad as Naruto), Rurouni Kenshin (only the first 60 something are worth watching), YuYu Hakusho (112 episodes, awesome, classic series), Detective Conan (this you'll love- 500+ episodes, brilliant story, fillers air often but are basically random cases you won't really mind), Ghost in the Shell (has two seasons, some 50 eps if I recall), etc.|`|Ttf7867jaa	They will continue if there's demand for the show - fans buy dvds or maybe if ratings for the show is high.

6IHvMqsMaa	haha, nice rant =]    It does annoy me, mainly because I can't put myself in their shoes - but in all honesty I broke my toe and walked over 50 miles on it before realising (only did notice because it was bent the wrong way and was... well you don;t want the details) lol. And then I walked another 50 miles... but my friend broke his toe and was on crutches for several weeks, we all respond differently I suppose.     *I do not want sympathy - I got none at the time, just told I was a retard, haha)    But if you claim to break your foot, lol, and then come in acting fine, then that's rather stupid.    Hahaaa, not seeing a doctor and just knowing it is broken - rather silly again. Its like people coming out of exams saying - I've definitely passed that - WTF? how do you know?

When someone shows up at work complaining that they have I migraine, it is all I can do to keep my mouth shut.|`|a4993552752cc787c811fe933d03022daa	I haven't been in a situation where someone has made a fake claim to me, of having any broken bones, fractures.

Leda2ha0aa	I think that last season's Vickie & Heba teams were the worst in history.  People talk about how they hate Joelle on here - she really did upset me with her blank facial expressions, constant babbling and lack of motivation.  But this was nothing compared to Heba and Vickie.      Vickie ended up having to change her phone number because she had people calling her and mailing her letters about how much she was hated, I read she even got death threats.    The other teams did not vote to keep Joelle that one week just to bring back Carla.  They voted to keep her because they knew she was a weak link and would be easy competition.  They knew she did not have the motivation.  It was pure strategy (as stated at elimination table) - not emotional to keep her.    I am enjoying this season more because people are really behind each other and want each other to succeed.  I still think that some people have been drinking a lot of water when they know they have immunity that week, so that they know they will have big weight loss next week (see Tara about week 2).  You are right though, it is so much more enjoyable this season than last.|`|AF46xoubaa	I absolutely hated Vicki and Heba.  I made sure to vote for Ed to the finals because I didn't want Heba in there.  I was sad that she won the at home.  Vicki is the worst person they have ever had on that show and I have watched them all.|`|AA11791312	I have to agree, although - and I can't believe I'm saying this - Joelle has helped me appreciate Vicky and Heba! Yes they were malicious, conniving, backstabbing, calculating bullies, both of them. BUT...when Bob pushed them, they worked and worked HARD, whether or not they really learned anything about losing the weight and keeping it off. They wanted that money so damn bad they were at least willing to work and work HARD for it, even if they went back to burgers and buffet food after the show.     Joelle? She just didn't care either way.  And I LOVE the way the entire house saved her that one time....but only to bring Carla back. The love they showed her when the Silver Team got booted just proves it.  Everybody loves a winner, but I think they love fighters even more and that's what Carla is.     OTOH, Joelle? Whatever.

I would have to believe that they are weighed in before the televised weigh in - this way they have the percentages ready and then they can pick a certain order to weigh in to create a dramatic moment for television.  I would think during the first weigh in, they shed everything.|`|L0OyvCYkaa	i totally agree. maybe they are cheating. you know, one week they might be a little heavier, then they take all the jewellery off and they have lost 12kg! wow. lol|`|dApctU2Haa	I agree with katanast. I doubt that wearing jewelry makes much of a difference, and if it did, those contestants sure wouldn't be wearing it. They would probably be advised to take jewelry off, also, for weigh-ins if it mattered.|`|S5XReswIaa	I think that because they are on the ranch all the time and always working out, the weigh in is there chance to be a little dressy and make themselves feel good.  They did lose some weight and they are not able to wear the the "black dress" yet, so they wear a little make up and some jewelry.  "When you look good, you feel good".  That's just my opinion.|`|AF46xoubaa	That scale is all for tv.....they are weighed ahead of time.  Actually underwater with special equipment that gives a true weight and body fat percentile.  They do not know their weight until they are on the scale we see so we get the shock value.|`|htBHCNDtaa	I guess they don't think.|`|AA11791312	You're kidding, right? The scales don't work that way. If 1/16th of an ounce made a difference between immunity and elimination, I think people would be taking off jewelry, CLOTHES...ANYTHING it would take to win for another week. In the scheme of things, taking off or putting on earrings or a watch is not going to be a big deal.

cgfE0yyzaa	There is no exact date on when it will start, but yes a new Suzumiya Haruhi anime was announced. It's rumored (or maybe confirmed, not sure) to be a whole new, untold story about Haruhi. A poster of Haruhi with her long hair was featured in July 2008 edition of Japan's Newtype magazine - presumably before she cut it. The image: http://moe.imouto.org/post/show/26431    There was a rumor it's going to air this April, but it turns out they will re-air the first season: http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=66...    So at this point, the new Haruhi anime is confirmed but no one knows when it will air.    In related news there's a Haruhi net animation (ONA) spin-off set to release in February 13: http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=63...|`|8xVGuEDkaa	The new season of the anime series was first announced in a full-page advertisement of Asahi Shimbun on July 7, 2007 in Japan.[43] Promotional videos for the new season included a live action sequence inspired by the "Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody" chapter from the third novel which depicts Haruhi and Kyon breaking into school grounds with the footage taken from surveillance cameras. On December 18, 2007, the anime's official website, haruhi.tv, was replaced by a fake 404 error with five form input fields.[44] If KNSAK (the initials of the SOS Brigade members' family names, with the exception of Kyon, whose initial is taken from his nickname) was inputted, a fake xterm interface opened with messages by "YUKI.N".[45] At the end of these messages, the enter key could be pressed, which redirected the viewer to an informational page about the new season.[46] As reported by Anime News Network, "the 'disappearance' of the website on December 18 at 4:00 a.m. (Japan Standard Time) is a reference to the pivotal date in The Vanishment of Haruhi Suzumiya, the fourth volume in the light novel series and an apparent indication of which novel plot the anime project will adapt."[44]|`|v6IOiPumaa	There will be a season two released soon online; but you won't be able to watch it unless you're in Japan; something to do with the IP or youtube settings that say 'you need to be in Japan' in order to watch this or something like that.|`|pJ0k4DSwaa	theyre gonna re-air the first season because they skipped some scenes which wont connect to the second season.     The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2006 Has only 13 episodes! But on April 15, The melancholy of haruhi suzumiya 2009 will have 24 episodes.  i got this information in KyoAni and i live in japan.

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	It's simply an arrangement of 'Primavera' ('Spring').

1675ab520649de846e54a4b76149c50baa	I can answer as the opposite as I am a Scorpio woman who was with her Capricorn man for two years.  I admit to being very possesive of him as he was flirtatious with other women - which drove me crazy and caused arguments. There was also a problem with the balance of control in the relationship. We both wanted to be in control. I believe that as another person answered, it can work as Capricorns and Scorpios do like having one romantic partner in their lives at one time. Capricorns are also uncomplicated vs. Scorpio moodiness and that is a good balance. Scorpios also bring out the passionate nature in Capricorns. I think what did work well for me with him was that when I because upset he was an extremely good listener and stayed rational where I am irrational. I also respected his good sense of business and work ethic.|`|0uMLrKAbaa	scorpio's personality is extremely complex n contradictory. they r serious, authoritative, jealous, possessive n deep thinkers. because of their intuitive sense they r able to find out other people weaknesses. sometimes scorpios can be cold, introverted, polemic and lunatic but beyond but beyond the surface there r many good qualities such as strength and the fact that they r always ready to help other people. they r seldom afraid and they r determined to reach their goals.    They r very passionate people, but in a love relationship they r contradictory and complicated. when they fall in love they give themselves body n soul, even though their natural restlessness never abandons them.    scorpio men r violent, moody but passionate n exciting as well. their ideal woman is determined n hard to seduce. generally, scorpios prefer hiding their own emotions n hate mawkishness es.    TIP: be precious with him. make him feel that he is special. never take him non seriously. never give him any reason to be jealous.    scorpio n capricorn relationship can be good! ,|`|1bkiNiwzaa	Idk exactly about this relation, but I would sure like to point out that anyone getting involved with Scorpio should know these things about Scorpio- obsessed with s**, very manipulative, very powerful.    So just be careful.|`|TVs6R1Wxaa	hey i am a capricorn girl too.i don't know|`|55bffae43f7b7cfbd5b53cdc525c5a75aa	capricorn must cut out the negative nervousness.    the other things is great
4fynzEGwaa	I think that whole thing is just sick!! I am not sorry if I offend any one I think same sex marriage is wrong! I think plural marriage is wrong!! When God crated the heavens and the earth he created one man and one woman!!! not a man and a man not a woman and a woman! not a man and a woman and a woman!!!!! I could go on forever I think I should not have answered this no I've got myself all worked up!!|`|j0e31EdOaa	http://cinerel.org/|`|UUKWOWhnaa	It's perfectly fine for those who welcome it.If all are happy then there is no problem with it. Quite frankly i feel it's nobody's business. There are many who are raised with this is as the norm, when people aren't raised with these norms then obviously they will have a problem with it.It's the same as meat eaters who are raised on beef going to other countries and think it's disgusting that they eat cat's and dogs!! This baffles me. I think all should be free and have the same rights and protections.It takes many different,decent people to make a society.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Traditional marrige only, if we give them an inch they will take us a mile!!|`|rptP7ynpaa	personally I like gay guys, they're friendly and funny, and who cares if they're "morally incorrect" they're people too.|`|IizPFrELaa	Marriage is between 2 count them 2 people!    Be it a straight marriage or a "gay marriage"|`|0TtLt667aa	Amen to that. just don't go starting any religion.|`|AA11938631	Why are there no polygamist females ? Or maybe there and no one hears about them. I would bet there are none, because a man would not share his wife with other men in the household. I prefer just two people in a marriage, be it man and women , man and man, or women and women.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	I  Dont believe in it but love is love no matter how you look at it..im not to judge|`|0GDgg2zsaa	idk|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	there are more people to consider....like children .....I dont think it is fair on them as they dont get to choose the alternate lifestle...and like you say its not for everyone.....so I think it is better for traditional in this sense....2 parents I think is more ideal for kids  :  )|`|e1d902a1e3f67c79f0006f242202774daa	i go whereever i think others will be happy. if it's plural weddings, then so.    besides, gay weddings are much more fun.|`|onkUcy19aa	That would be very, very complicated, and all I want is a simple life with one wife and probably 4 children, at most.     I don't subscribe to pluralism because of my religion.|`|yH39NEXSaa	Marriage should be between 1 man and 1 woman. End of story.      Bring. On. The. Thumbs. Down!!!|`|09zVUMBRaa	I feel polygamy is okay as long as it's fair.  Meaning, women with multiple husbands.  Otherwise, forget it.    Codicil: Really ancient men  (like 80) should not be marrying 12 year olds.|`|43JgLpkKaa	marriage : 1 man and 1 woman .... just like God stated in the beginning !!|`|dd7f6eb566c0d6a7067106dd5cbbc4e3aa	i agree one man one woman|`|EONXaXYEaa	Wow, I've never heard about that. It would be quite interesting, but if I were in congress, I would have to vote no.|`|hBcMiZDBaa	I am a mormon. keep that in mind.    I dont like it. and I dont agree with it. my religion banned it hundreds of years ago. and I also think its weird. and those polygamists (who ARENT mormons by the way. saying THEY are mormons is like saying baptists are catholics) are just weird and very wicked people. its sad to hear on the news about a bunch of people being totured there.    I disagree with it and im mormon (so does every other mormon. every mormon disagrees with polygamy)    thats my opinion|`|JPDxyTT3aa	because no one wants 1/3 of something if they get divorced.     and bc getting married to more then 1 woman would be a nightmare.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	Polygamy is illegal. more because of the tax loopholes it would open up, rather than for any moral reason.     The debate is never grouped with Homosexual marriage as they are not similar. they are only similar in that they are outside the norm. So, to say that becouse gay people can marry, Poligamy should be legalised too doesn't make sense.....     That's like saying.... If Marijuana is legalized, rape should be legalized also. The only thing marijuana and rape have in common is their illegality, so too, the only thing Gay marriage and polygamy have in common is their illegality at one time.  They cannot be bound together.|`|XS0ltAYaaa	I think its ok to have plural marriages so long as everyone is treated equally & no one is favoured above* another. If people can be happy in such relationships, then they shouldn't be judged by society.
t2KJijUpaa	Sophie's she planted it there for attention. When confronted she told her mum and dad that she was pregnant. but later when kevin was at the pub and it was just sophie and sally, she told her shes not really pregnant and she made the whole thing up for attention.   as she is fed up with Rosie getting all the attention|`|956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	Like the other  answerers have said she said she did it to get attention.  The trouble I have with that explanation is why did she hide it then?  If the bin bag hadn`t broken Kevin would never have found it.  Maybe it`s her friends test and she`s pregnant.|`|VQpu20kDaa	Sophies    But she isn't pregnant, only attention seeking|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	It was Sophie's but she's not pregnant.She just wanted some attention from her mum and dad!|`|iFCBEZW7aa	Sophies but she certainly aint pregnant.  She's just an attention seeker.|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	Sophie's cry for help to get those two parents to notice they actual have another daughter other than Rosie and it worked however next story line Sophie gets a good boyfriend who turns her to religion.|`|Un4aFFUNaa	Yes it was Sophies and no she is not pregnant.  She set the whole thing up to get attention from her parents.|`|f1608bdb212d4515049acab36a99ef38aa	it was Sophie's pregnancy test and no she isn't pregnant she did it to get attention from her parents by saying she was pregnant then kevin went mad and was demanding to know who the father was sally kicked him to the pub then later on it came out that she wasn't pregnant she was after attention as rosie was getting it all and she wasn't getting any hope this helps you|`|v1uNUcwCaa	it was Rita's so she would get a better storyline!|`|j0e31EdOaa	http://cinerel.org/|`|DtU1EpoVaa	It was Sophies and  she is not pregnant. She did it to get attention from her parents just like she sent the postcard when John kidnapped Rosie|`|e785823013fcf53d3eb03bda32a095bdaa	Hey there ye it was sophies but she made the whole thing up she isnt pregnant ! she just did it to get attention from her mum and dad ..... !!|`|B0ypUuHXaa	It was Sophie's, but it was all a stunt so she could get attention. She told Sally and Kevin it was positive, and then told them the truth when Sally said she had to go to the doctors. Kevin was angry she lied, but Sally realised she must have gone through the humiliation of buying one just because she needed attention from her parents.
MX0s76pzaa	Next time, ask your Twilight Qs In the "Movies" section instead. Why?  1. You will get more answers about It there than asking It here In the Comics and Animation section.  2. Twilight questions pollute C&A (even though they have NOTHING to do with anime) and everyone gets fed up with them.    As for the torrent, It's just as Fu said, the real version hasn't come out yet.|`|ZZR9OTzVaa	Try searching for Twilight Torrent here.    http://searchtor.com/index.php?category=...|`|KSC02NcLaa	Its still in Theatres, DVDrips don't come out until its on DVD.

sNE4orNgaa	I liked a short story he did which apeared in a compilation called autopsy room and it was about a dead guy who was not really dead and they found out because the hot nurse accidently gave him an erection while checking him out. . . kind of creepy but unforseen all the less- very comedic dark humour|`|QPiIRyDYaa	The Bachman books.|`|90i8RqKoaa	The Shining and Cell|`|BdiQPKn0aa	Shawshank Redemption without a doubt|`|frwlypDWaa	Stephen King is one of my favorite writers. The guy sure knows how to tell a story, doesn't he?    "'Salem's Lot" is the best vampire story I've ever read.    "It" creeped me out. The movie? Except for the clown (Tim Curry), not so much...    His short story collections are second to none.    For sheer audacity, "The Dark Tower" series was probably my favorite.|`|cJcwHBglaa	Ah I love the Shining!

Book...i'm a diehard fan of The Shining, obviously, but I really liked the intricate nature of the plot of Needful Things, as well as the obvious creeping anticipatory sense of foreboding that builds through the novel - but come on it's Stephen King, it's hard to find fault with any of his books (except The Stand, I found it very long and at times a little hard to follow).|`|onkUcy19aa	My favorite novels by Stephen King are:    1.

2JAB7ODsaa	I'm Australian and hated it!

There is even, within moments of the opening scenes, Rolf Harris's wobble board.    But Baz Lehman's long-awaited, and over-budget epic Australia manages, against the odds, to avoid turning into one big sun burnt stereotype about God zone country. Instead, in what turns out to be a multilayer story it describes an Australia of the 1940s that is at once compellingly, beautiful and breathtakingly cruel.     Described as a cross between Gone with the Wind and Out of Africa it bears, in fact, little resemblance to either movie  apart from a similarly spectacular landscape as Out of Africa and a plot line that loosely resembles that of Gone with the Wind.    In this case, Lady Sarah Ashley, a passionless English aristocrat (Nicole Kid man), inherits a vast cattle station in the Northern Territories only to find that the station is the target of a dastardly takeover plot.     Much against her will, she is forced to enlist the help of a local stock man known only as Drover (Hugh Jack man), to save the station by driving her huge herd of cattle hundreds of miles across the Juryman desert to Darwin. Which is then bombed by the Japanese.    In the worst Mills and Boon tradition, Lady Sarah  whose emotions are as frozen as Kid man's forehead  and the rough neck Drover loathe each other on sight but, as they endure the harsh and rather dusty travails of the cattle drive they quite quickly fall in love. She even teaches him to dance. Under a BOB tree.    But if it sounds shallow and predictable, Australia is, in fact, anything but.    The cliches are saved by little jokes and asides, as if Lehman is saying 'Yes, I know, but what can you do?' In an early scene, as the newly-arrived Sarah drives toward her station, Faraway Downs, with Drover, a herd of kangaroo lopes alongside their vehicle.    As Sarah oohs and ahas with melodramatic wonder, a shot rings out and one of the kangaroos falls, killed by an Aboriginal stock man riding, literally, shot gun on the roof of the car. The horrified aristocrat spends the rest of the trip staring at the hind leg of the kangaroo hanging disconsolately over the windscreen, and the trails of blood that trek through the dust on the glass.    Later that evening she pops her head out of her tent door to behold the kangaroo being roasted for dinner plus (more importantly) the sight of a half naked Drover soaping himself down; a scene that will only do for Jack man what James Bond's swimming briefs did for Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, and will ensure Jack man as Craig's only viable cinematic rival as the heart throb du jour.    But what gives the film its heart is something else entirely. This is also the story of Null ah (Brandon Walters), a mixed race Aboriginal boy left orphaned by the inhumanity of Australian law. The 1940s was the time of the Stolen Generation, when mixed race children were banned from living either with their Aboriginal families or within the white community, but were taken from their homes to be brought up in church missions.    Mullah's increasingly frantic attempts to escape from the 'coppers' and his symbiotic relationship with his grandfather, the mystical King George, played with awesome power by the renowned Aboriginal dancer and musician David Gulping, is treated with a stark honesty and is what actually makes this film truly Australian in both its best and its worst sense.    Brandon, 13, was discovered by Lehman in his local swimming pool in the West Australian town of Broome and he plays Nullah with a combination of mischief and tragedy that may turn him into the real star of the film, despite  or perhaps because of  the fact that he has never acted before.    Australia is reported to have gone $US30million over its $US100 million budget and right to the last minute there was speculation that it would not be finished in time for its Australian premiere.    Australian audiences  who are already in love with the film  are guaranteed to flock to the box office but Luhrmann needs the American market if he is to break even. If all else fails there is always Jackman, stripped to the waist, under the shower. That if nothing else should pull them in.       It's not too good tough.|`|VSDGX0LFaa	Well I haven't exactly heard of any gleaming reviews, but what can I say? I haven't even seen it.

Chaka Khan because shes the best live singer out there and Billy Idol because he really puts alot into entertaining the crowd (going into the crowd himself, bringing people up on stage, dancing around etc.).|`|pCbnKj0waa	I went to see Rush last summer...

Spice girls [no] but the other 2 i would never be able to decide. My first gig was Instill's and I did my first lot of 'moshing' lol it's so fun! and then there was The Zuton's concert in West Arboretum where they were supported by Mystery Jets and Noah and the Whale - so that was totally amazing too. And I think it'll be a 3-way tie in a couple weeks because I'm going to my friend's gig and he's the singer of The Elevation and I love their music, so that'll be immense too. :)

I'm married with a Aries now for 11 years and he is sweet and i can talk with him and he can make me laugh. What i find sexy about him is he is a real man.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Aqarius...stubborn and has to be right.

But when I looked at an aquarius (me) and cancer relationship it wasn't anything like how either of us communicate in our relationship.|`|1PdUecpYaa	virgo - caring, protective, but very critical and gets jealous easily. couldn't make up his mind. i'm a pisces. we were complete opposites. we really didn't get each other.    leo - romantic, loving, fun to be with, but can be a bit selfish and self centred. doesn't like talking about emotional stuff... pretty nasty break up... his moon sign is aquarius so he acts like one sometimes especially when i got emotional... he'd block out any emotions and act cold...  i broke up with him 2 months ago and now i'm bitter and lonely...|`|j0e31EdOaa	http://cinerel.org/|`|HZxX9ke8aa	i dated with librans mostly and i know what you mean. they are super manipulative people, very smart and full of ideas (that's why they are indecisive anyway) and being a cancer myself, i was completing them with my insight (choosing the best given option by intuition)... so, intellectually, we were doing great, that's when we are alone and that's what a cancer wants, an intimate relationship... yet that's not really enough for them, they need an army of friends around themselves and being moody, eclectic and having "high standarts" it was always unbearable for me... feeling like i'm surrounded by idiots, you know?    but maybe you are more resilient than me.
AA11791312	I don't think there's a limit or a max, although it's pretty dumb to expect that you'll be on the show if you only have five or ten pounds to lose. Right now, both the heaviest man AND the heaviest woman they've ever had got eliminated - yet I don't think it was their overweight status that got them there, though it was part of it. Dan is 19 YEARS OLD, and Carla had an albatross around her neck named JOELLE...both facts about them that made for "good TV."    You could have 200 lbs. to lose, but if the combination of obesity and back-story don't come together in a way that serves the show well, you probably won't be considered as a future contestant.|`|dApctU2Haa	Yea, I looked on the website, too, under casting.It stated:    "-DID YOU GAIN THE WEIGHT AFTER PREGNANCY AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TAKE IT OFF?  -WERE YOU AN ATHLETE WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER AND THEN LIFE GOT IN THE WAY?   -DO YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT FOR YOUR WEDDING DAY OR TO START DATING AGAIN?  -ARE YOU A GRANDPARENT WHO WANTS TO BE AROUND TO SEE YOUR GRANDKIDS GROW UP?  -ARE YOU FINALLY READY TO LOSE THE WEIGHT ONCE AND FOR ALL?    WHATEVER YOUR REASON IS, WE ARE SEEKING BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND PARTNERS! "    I don't think there is a specific weight that you need to have, probably around 200+ pounds|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I think I saw a lady on there who was 190. could be by bmi. call them or email to find out|`|S5XReswIaa	Actually the first season, a girl was eliminated the second week and she was 175lbs.

fAg6cLP5aa	obviously, first of all check if the strings are in place at the nut and at the bridge of the guitar. secondly, the 'fuzz' you're getting may be your neck's fault. its angle may be incorrect, and therefore when you play, the strings makes contact with the fret and buzzes and u can check the severity of the problem by checking what fret this is happening on. cover each fret on each string one at a time and strum until the buzzing stops. if this is in fact your problem, you will need a neck adjustment. i had my gibson adjusted last year, and it's going fine for now. it happens, and it's nothing to be worried about.|`|ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	Changing to a heavier o a lighter gauge of string will cause a change in tension on the neck. A simple adjustment will fix it. Take it to a shop if you don't know how. Adjusting the truss rod can cause serious damage if you do it wrong|`|SkRJNhuCaa	Those are heavier strings compared to what come on the instrument as standard.  As a result you may have to adjust your trussrod and/or tremelo springs.    The manual for your guitar has information on how to do this, or you can take it to a dealer who'll do it for you (at a small price of course) and show you how to do it yourself next time.    Of course you should also make sure your guitar is properly tuned and the string tension not too low (which can also cause rattling).

On the Fandango presale for the Jonas Brothers tickets is $15...but i don't know if it's expensive because its a presale...or they are just trying to take advantage of the situation :D    anyways good luck and have fun!!

qzmMiLI1aa	Mission to Mars (2000)       When a mysterious storm kills all but one crew member of the first manned mission to mars, a rescue mission is launched. Once on the red planet, the crew finds the sole survivor of the first mission who informs them that this was no ordinary storm. It was meant to protect something. But what? Written by Eric Thal    Commander Luke Graham is selected to lead the first manned mission to Mars. Upon setting foot on the red planet, the team discovers an ancient, domelike structure which appears to be a beacon. The dome destroys the team and leaves Luke injured. The recently widowed Jim McConnell leads the rescue mission. When they arrive, they find Luke surprisingly alive, and he has spent the time alone learning the secrets of the mysterious construct. The question now becomes: do they enter the dome and answer humanity's oldest question, perhaps risking their lives in doing so, or return to Earth with what they do know and return in force with equipment and supplies?|`|uYVyEZ7Aaa	Mission To Mars    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183523/    :)|`|CKQtOusTaa	oh heres their site:  www.redtube.com|`|Lrf1NgUxaa	Mission to Mars|`|nYgUfUd7aa	Mission to Mars and it came out in 2000.|`|T5OMklFZaa	I think you ask about this movie:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_to_...

Iz5tNA5aaa	That is typically what Hollywood week is about -- drama -- especially group night.  They are back to singing by themselves next week.    I thought it was a little funny myself.  Some of those people are really pathetic.      I'm glad bikini girl is gone.|`|AA11791312	Maybe you haven't been watching this show long enough.  Yes, group rounds during Hell Week seemed a LOT more dramatic this season, but the drama happens about this time EVERY season. In fact, if you really couldn't watch this last episode, you might want to wait until the first live show before you watch IDOL again. Because next week is the individual performance round...and here's where the meltdowns get to be REALLY bad. Because this time, there's no group members to hide behind. The contestants will either "rise and shine" or "crash and burn." And the cameras will show it all (well, most of it.)|`|9rLi9pSRaa	I agree with your observations.  It wasn't a very good show but what it did bring to the surface was how the contestants interact with each other. I think the producers want to see that and if  they have any problem people they have to get rid of.  They did.  I was surprised the really gay guy stayed on.  I can't think of his name but he had the sunglasses on the top of his head and was acting really stupid and prancing around a lot.  He won't stay.  They won't put up with that kind of girliness from a guy.  Too over the top.  So now they have 75 and next week will cut them down to 36.  Should be interesting.  After all this time they still have the viewers.|`|hCqJMe9xaa	omgosh! I'm so glad bikini girl is gone she was a total. b. i. t. c. h. to her group and to kara too!|`|ZXr8BSRyaa	I think a few people got through who should have got sent home, but bikini girl is gone.  How the heck Tatiana got thru is amazing to me.|`|zdrXmriAaa	Well, that's pretty much what group night is all about, the drama and the tears. The first half hour, though, was all drama, and it got a bit annoying. :|    Anyway I'm glad bikini girl is gone, she's such a b.i.t.c.h.!!! And tatiana, too, i'm not really sure how she got through.  Too bad emily (pink hair) didn't make it! I like her.    I'm loving adam lambert and michael castro. x]    Can't wait for next week. :)|`|6iut4NN2aa	I thought judges did a great job. There was a lot of talent there and a lot of crap that were sent home.  Dont forget they cant just send everyone home, they need to make it a little exciting so you can watch it next time again.|`|456OFsHvaa	That's what group rounds are. They test your skill as a singer and see if you have the ability to adapt to whatever surroundings you may have. The judges also want to see if you know how to perform as a team and if you can rehearse well; if necessary, they also want to see if you can make any last-minute adjustments if one of your group members is missing/sick, or if your song just doesn't work. Group rounds actually are about talent; the entire night challenges your skill as an all-around great performer.

btrMdy5Uaa	I always thought it was because they felt like Ryan was doing a fine job all by himself...but heres the reason:        from wiki:  Having admitted a weight problem, Dunkleman appeared on the sixth season of VH1's Celebrity Fit Club. It was on Celebrity Fit Club that he spoke about his reasons for leaving American Idol after hosting the first season. He stated his departure was due to the terrible way they treated the young contestants on the show, staging the fights between the judges and reshooting contestants with producer-provided, glycerin tears in their eyes. He went on to say that leaving the show was a mistake. However, the doctor on the panel reminded him that acting according to one's values is never a mistake. Dunkleman lost 15 pounds on the show, and his team won the grand prize|`|rF1fpyenaa	I often wondered myself.  I don't know the answer but I am guessing maybe he thought the whole thing was cheezy.  He's probably kicking himself now.  He probably had no idea the show would last so long and be such a success.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	Brian Dunkleman, who the heck is that?  I must have missed that season all together.  I would have remembered the name alone.  I haven't heard of the guy since.  Is it for real?  Dunkleman?

LcSwDbr4aa	Samurai Chaploo (like it was stated before, this series was made by the guy that made Cowboy Bebop)  Rerouni Kenshin   Samurai 7 (take the classic black and white masterpiece, add giant robots in Trigun type of world=awesomeness)  Chrono Crusade (kind of like Cowboy Bebop in time setting, a little like Outlaw Star's premise in reverse, this time it's the lady in charge of the safety of the guy)  Hellsing  Moribito (another kind of like Outlaw Star's premise reversed, only it takes place in an feudal era)  Claymore (a little darker than most anime, but kind of like Cowboy Bebop, but instead of a team of bounty hunters, it's a group of elite demon slayers hunting equally dangerous demons)  Eureka 7 (has the ragtag group of Cowboy Bebop, some of the humor found in Trigun, and some mech stuff thrown in for good measure, although probably will be hard to get into)  Fate/Stay Night (main character believes pretty much everything Vash from Trigun does, without the obsession of donuts)  Code Geass (Outlaw Star like plot)  Full Metal Panic (Outlaw Star like premise for plot)  Full Metal Alchemist (Because it's one of the BEST ANIMES EVER!!!)  Devil may cry (Dante, like Vash is an excellent gunfighter)  Ghost in the Shell or Appleseed (takes place in a futuristic setting like Cowboy Bebop)   Karas (main protagonist and antagonist shares a lot in common with Spike and Vicious from Cowboy Bebop)  Lucky Star (Lucky Channel Segments are kind of like the Big Shot segements from Cowboy Bebop)|`|32xabB4oaa	I loved all of those too.

A spate of similar crimes committed by separate suicidal groups known as "The Individual Eleven" becomes the core focus for Section 9 as war approaches in the form of refugees flooding into the country.

You might like Trinity Blood as well... its kind of similar to Trigun in my opinion. (Abel is a lot like Vash.)  Michiko to Hatchin reminds me of Cowboy Bebop as well. Perhaps its just the underworld/mafia feel to it though...  And Vandread is similar to Outlaw Star.|`|ttyuhvGPaa	Gun X Sword - is like Bebop only set in Wild west fashion.  Darker than Black - take Bebop + Trigun + Batman and that in itself literally sums this series.

Why do you ask that Twilight is stupid?  It's a great book and I really appreciate the book very much.  I don't think people who doesn't have care for their lives should go out of their places and find somewhere else. Becasue I really don't think that they are messing up a good book.    Let them think another time to explian the reason why Twilight is stupid.    But it's better to watch the movie directly than to read the book. Books are the sae than movies. But the good thing with the book is you can read the seasons all of it while waiting for the movie.

Faraday thinks it's related to the amount of time that a person has spent on the island... in the episode you might not have seen yet, Miles also has a nosebleed. He asks Faraday why the 815 survivors aren't affected since they've been on the island a long time, but he's only been there for two weeks... and Faraday asks him "Are you sure about that?"|`|2651822e8844588a4e782839c98ff665aa	Daniel saw what is happening to Charlotte happen to someone else when they were building the hatch.

q7z7Ni3Daa	Technically, a cell(ular) phone is a type of mobile phone. PCS is another type and as someone said, many people include car phones in mobile even though they are not cell phones.    What it comes down to is this though. Americans created it, so Americans get to name it.    So there! ;)    Edit: mys24, you mentioned that it's a proven fact Americans are lazy when it comes to language(......) Could you post the source of that fact please? I have a hard time accepting it, so your source would make for interesting reading and enlightenment on my part. Thanks! =)|`|wmBK9uASaa	Only one syllable|`|huto12P3aa	They just say different words to the british for some words.|`|rptP7ynpaa	because cell is short for CELLULAR which is the correct term for 'mobile' phone|`|Rc1351g4aa	because there different even tho they are american they speak english get your own language yanks|`|tFGMfDthaa	Because I think that in America mobile phone means a car phone.|`|oDzOYMjDaa	Everyone here can pronounce "cell" while "mobile"can have different pronounciations. Cell's just easier. American's are very lazy when it comes to language (no offense, I am American, but it's a proven fact, eve if you do speak with proper grammar)|`|cgqgomawaa	there are lots of differences between languages. even though we both speak english, there are differences, like we say fortnight, American's say two weeks.|`|sVFkMVujaa	i guess the same reason brits say "boot" instead of "trunk"? dunno.|`|7sXNwFynaa	cellular , not sure what it means, maybe it is a new term.    idk.|`|6Nmly1wmaa	Cause Mobile's are what we called um back in the 80's they ARE cell phones|`|fMxVDps3aa	Because a mobile is also something that goes on babies cribs. And a gas station of course.|`|a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	Maybe because here a mobile refers to a mobile home of which we have a lot.  I do not know..lots of words are different here.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Same reason why you say Mobile instead of Cell phone.|`|yBWFn0JYaa	Well why do a they say a lot of things weird? IDK?!|`|BGKIJeTGaa	I dunno. I'm Filipino and I say Cell Phone.|`|nq9ZSHXraa	I think its just the language they use and different words to the british :) x|`|fl3vTwjGaa	Because there totally awesome dude|`|Zhfxd7PKaa	I say cellular device and I am American.|`|PYjoulnNaa	Why do the Chinese talk about hand phone rather than cell phone???|`|601769880381ed0f6423429080479dccaa	Why do you say:  Lift instead of elevator  Nappies instead of diapers  Brolly instead of umbrella  Dosh instead of cash  Flat instead of apartment|`|10knD5g0aa	It's called English for a reason.. cos it was founded here in England.. The Americans have bastardised the English language to make it sound more of their own..|`|If7d3qJIaa	A cell phone is  really a radio.   Back in the beginning in the radio telephone system, there was one central antenna tower per city, and perhaps 25 channels available on that tower  The cellular phone system divides the area of a city into small cells. This allows extensive frequency reuse across a city, so that millions of people can use cell phones simultaneously.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	we differ from them that all, like we drive on the left.  as for Putra remarks... he's forgetting that it was the British that found american land so where would that put you if we hadn't ??|`|DNQxUcptaa	It's probably something to do with the origination of the mobile phone networks. They are cellular in arrangement, in fact we did start off referring to this with companies such as 'Cellnet', but this seems to have morphed into a more general description of 'mobile'.|`|QIwhMrBraa	why do americans say other things we dont say? why dont americans say 'nappy' or 'dummy' or 'pram' or 'cheers' or a zillion other words just because it may be english, it aint the same country, is it. just like the aussies the yanks broke away from england, is it a big surprise they use different words. they dont eat the same s**t either.|`|q02UN23aaa	because it is short for cellular phone, which runs off of cellular towers.|`|NePxlTnZaa	It comes from the word cellular.    A mobile phone network is made up of numerous short range base/relay stations which create individual bubbles or cells of signal reception, which overlap and join up with each other to create a wider geographic area of network service, your mobile phone automatically connects itself to the base station with the strongest signal.    If you can remember back, O2, before it was sold off used to be BT cellnet.|`|d5aa461bdb5fa1bfd8158df539805abeaa	The first phones installed in cars in the USA where called mobile phones.  There was pretty much one tower in your area and the phone was just a simple 2 way radio.  If you ventured too far out of town you would loose signal.  Later came "cells",  they were several towers spread out over a large geographic area.    Because of the rural nature of the USA when Cellular Phones first came out you were really aware of the cells as you traveled from one broadcast 'cell' tower to the next.  Driving in your car the hand off from one cell to the next would often drop your call.  You would always need to tell people you were on a "cell" phone to warn them you might be dropping the call.|`|AA11523465	Why do you use unnecessary apostrophes?|`|07YZSMolaa	its different everywhere its just what your brought up with ive just moved to germany from uk and they call them handys!! lol|`|oGoumhBgaa	same reason us kiwis do :) just because...enough said :)

You never bought the cooked sliced chicken from a supermarket. ie reformed chicken. Well it has every part of a chicken you can think of in it. But it tastes nice so who cares.|`|4Ef8yCbfaa	I have my dear Goatboy :)    Think it was in the form of a kebab|`|KkSW6EViaa	nope, & i don't really plan on doing so.  it's bad enough people eat their wings. poor chickens :(    meat is murder.    :)|`|dsDxmuLaaa	noke...  gross!|`|onkUcy19aa	Yes.

c5njkH5Oaa	Toyota Aygo! It's very easy on the fuel, very economical, its Japaneese, so it's good on quality (mine has never gone wrong yet), easy to park, and cheap to buy!  Plus low insurence group which is really important when you are a new driver...insurence is a killer!!|`|XS0ltAYaaa	Dodgem car.|`|bdzHtXJGaa	ill tell u what.....  go for a small car if u r the only one travelling.something with safety stuff like airbags and all... u know...  my suggestion for a good car is a sparky.something compact,stylish,and safe.|`|IR5hyVUbaa	It should be 4-door, 4-cyls, not sporty. I would prefer Honda or Toyota... First time drivers usually have much more expensive car insurance, and it depends from car. You should compare insurance rates while choosing the car - for example here - carquotes.imess.net|`|tFGMfDthaa	I recommend a Honda Civic. It's the most reliable car I have ever owned including one that I totaled and walked away from the accident with only minor injuries. Even my husband who prefers larger cars really likes driving mine.     Hondas cost a little more but are worth it. They retain their value. They don't break down very often. They are low maintenance. And they get good gas mileage too. I know people who own Hondas that have up to 200,000 miles on them.|`|PIeronuZaa	Top 10..take your pick    http://www.gayot.com/lifestyle/automobil...|`|pNUtnoC8aa	A Ford Pinto!!|`|CEKZsoFRaa	fiesta, any toyota|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	toyota tercel|`|UdwIaCxBaa	Monster Truck    : )|`|ujN57lxTaa	japanese|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	a motor bike|`|cgqgomawaa	ford ka :)|`|ccOJn7q8aa	get a diesel engined car if you are going to travel a lot|`|qRM0r7eVaa	Nissan micra..its the best little car on the road.|`|TZiySTOGaa	fiesta 1.1|`|zYQtUuzmaa	Ford Ka's are perfect frist time cars.

70OHpjySaa	I understand what youre saying and for some reason, that movie had a big impact on me.    First, I tried to record it several times on TV, when it was on the schedule, but it was pulled out and replaced by something else. I thought some executive on TV was pulling it out from the schedule each time at the last minute, because it was too racy, being about S&M, or maybe just after having seen the poster! (see sources).  So, that REALLY made me want to see it even more!    Then, when I finally saw it, I thought it was the best roles for Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader. They really had chemistry so thick you could cut it with a knife!    The big surprise is that movie is extremely sexy while at the same time being extremely sweet. Hard combination to achieve anywhere, if you ask me.    So far, Ive seen that movie three times.|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	I love that film - it is well written and well acted.    Good choice, might treat my hubby to a watch of it tonight....|`|MzZ1xenkaa	yes i watched it with my sister and my sister is uptight and she kept saying ewww that girls touching herself lol  i just told her to shut up as she kept asking loads of questions and i hate people that do that when im watching a film lol|`|JmdnlQsHaa	yeah ive seen that a few times.  its funny and maggie gyllenhaal is a great actress|`|c5njkH5Oaa	it was interesting...but  a bit wierd|`|lJZNGsZCaa	Yes I have, very strange woman, find James Spader character quite sinister, but an entertaining film nethertheless.|`|zPu3D88naa	yeah its not to bad|`|nyDPFTT7aa	Yes i seen that film before on Film Four and i didn't like it, it was a bit weird. x|`|QGkaMovlaa	yeah its good, bit weird|`|AA10886678	yes its a really different film which i think was quite under rated at the time
3Z4YFz29aa	no, but her face seemed to swell up, and she needs to NEVER wear those mom jeans again!|`|QGuxbItCaa	iluv2eat....with a name like that of course you would like fat people.|`|uQoBeM0Xaa	I dont know... its ok. But in the end who really cares? Her songs suck anyway.|`|pzQ4N6hnaa	not at all ilike her  like this she is absolutely ok|`|GCl84SPLaa	Nope|`|mZcdC90Uaa	I agree with Seb her songs do suck and it doesn't matter what she does. If she wants to be fat let her. The only problem I see with gaining weight is the actual health issue with diabetes, heart problems, and all that stuff. If she doesn't care about the risks then she can let her self go all she wants. It is shallow for the media to cover her 24/7 just because she put on a little weight.  Stefani|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	Really?I didnt notice....|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	she is a disgusting blimp    very unattractive|`|DMpVSHvXaa	I think that it's none of my business and that I don't care.

493063d6139840a25805427e0c89ce9aaa	If she had fallen, American Idol would have allowed Square Dancing because she would have been a "ho down". Get it?|`|5LxpvXSmaa	No she didn't have the chops pure and simple. She is a sly one working the cameras and she got what she wanted exposure so we have not seen the end of Katrina unfortunately. She may not be on Idol but with all her press VH1 has got to be a knockin.|`|HknnehIsaa	I think she was definetely a "diva."  It was definetelt time for her to go.  I think Simon and Randy were distracted a little by the whole bikini thing......  She sure showed her colors when she wouldn't even congratulate the other girl!|`|CofT1t1aaa	no i wasnt surprised,  she was horrible and the only reason she was there is because she was eye candy for the guy judges|`|hCqJMe9xaa	I'm just so tired I've been weaing heels since three in the morning and my back really hurts.    take the heels off! omgosh I hated her so much I wantedto walk up to her and slap her and tell her to stop being a b**ch to everyone. I wish she would have fallen down the stairs once she got eliminated. I would have laughed my head off|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	Kara DioGuardi saw right through her, I wish they didn't bleep out what she said... She shouldn't have made it to Hollywood, she didn't get there with her talent, she had a bad attitude & was trying to seduce & flirt with Simon to get votes, luckily they didn't let her get away with it a second time.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	No I was not surprised, I was sooooo relieved! I didn't think she was a good singer at all, she sounded way too nasel-y and she tried to hard, and then she didn't want to work at it and she was too tired, wah wah wah|`|9rLi9pSRaa	I think they should have kept her for one more week just for comic relief. She was  a character and a definite diva.  She could work the room and got the attention she wanted.  I'm sure Simon will miss her.  So her voice wasn't all that good she was certainly entertaining.  ( like the cheap Madonna)  Maybe she could be a stripper in Hollywood.  She could have the "Failed American Idol" Stripper on the marquis.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	No. She was such a ****** to everyone: Kara, Paula, her group. I personally thought she sucked during her audition, but was actually okay on Week 1 of Hollywood week. But Katrina definitely was disappointing on Week 2, group week. I'm glad she finally got out, and did u see the way she's like, "My group's so fake"? OMFG!    Also, I think Rose should have made it! She was soooo talented!!|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	Only surprised because Simon and Randy loved looking at her, but I guess her voice actually broke through their daze.  She should never have made it to Hollywood Week based on her voice in the first place.|`|daij1eBCaa	I really couldn't stand her. She just had this attitude about her...I'm so glad she's gone because she wasn't that talented. Honestly, I didn't think she deserved to get through to Hollywood in the first place but let's face it, she didn't get through based on her voice. ?

KdCzS5Q4aa	He's not himself anymore?! Do you know him personally?!  Seriously, you shouldn't judge people by their Youtube video's.|`|8ku6ox0Taa	i think that Joe and Nick are changing. I love Nicks new attitude but i miss the old Joe. someppl are saying that camilla bell is the reason that he is acting this way but i dont know thats why i am so happy about the new youtube video thats coming out  where he is going to shake his "tail feather" to single ladies|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	.................???????????????????????...|`|eUFsTmlsaa	you know i love joe he is my favorite  but i did notice a little change in him!...i know fame didn't change him because he is still himself maybe hes not feeling good or something...but now nick is talking more and kevin is just goofy ol kevin!...But did you go on the live chat when they had it in january?joe didn't really talk that much either!...and i told my sister something was up!...But idc i still love him!|`|MgOzpSs6aa	He has changed a little bit...i do miss the CRAZY Loud joe :( but i still luv him : )it seems the hotter he gets, the quieter, lol|`|RBt0Oz7maa	OK LISTEN    1. Joe started when he was 15 , hes 19 now , that called growing up , if he stayed the same , people would just say he was immature.    2. Hes still funny , i mean didnt you see him on the tonight show ? Hilaruos.    3. Also , he has always coverd for nick , in nicks shy days , like in interview when nick couldnt answer a question Joe ALWAYS helped him out , now joe is trying to let nick have the limelight and talk more. Joe used t talk more , because nick was quiet...now that nick isnt , all three of them talk the same.    4. OMG didnt u see their new vid of joe coming randomly of of that box with his cheesy smiley way he talked , hes still the same lol    5. dont worry because everyone said B , so in there next vid Joe is going to be shaking his tail feather to Beyonce! Thats gonna be funny!|`|jkXYlKJzaa	i couldnt care less|`|ZhDkr8wvaa	*sight* I miss DJ Danger *sight*...I miss the outgoing, funny, crazy, loud Joe Jonas..he has turned into a quite, shy serious Joe Jonas. I don't understand why?? People say he is maturing..What?? That's just stupid!! Just because you are maturing doesn't mean you can't be funny, crazy or talk anymore!! I really wish to know why my first "BIG CRUSH" had to change..Maybe it's because of Camilla Belle? She is 22 years old..maybe he tought that he wasen't matur to date her?? I really wanna met him and ask him what the heck is going on in his beautiful head??!! The danger side of Joe is fading!! He probably needs to get a new nickname soon (I HATE MYSELF FOR SAYING THIS!!)    Aww...Watch this video:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHZvC6KJp...    it made my cry!! Also this    That's my Joe:)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY-irUsZa...    Well..anyways..whatever happens..God bless Joseph Adam Jonas and may whatever that is bothering him, soon go away and  bring back our DJ Danger:P|`|I3WdUnTnaa	I honestly dont think joe is changing, i think he's just run down, tired, stressed maybe.    But the rubbish about camille belles age is driving me crazy. joe could date a 25 year old and it dosent bother me, why does everybody seem to think age is a problem. im 24 and i act like a teen but i also can be mature when i need to.     i think people need to chill and just give him some space, hes not changing, he probly has issues going on like every single human on earth has. give hime time and hell be back for sure.|`|YJfP8wjPaa	Yeah, I think Joe and Nick have changed. It's like they switched personalities, Joe is being real quiet and not saying or doing anythng funny, Nick is talking more and it was really funny when Nick dropped the ball. Joe is my favorite, but I'd hate it if he changed!

GI27dKIkaa	You'd have to contact someone like a magazine distributor    BUT - they'll only deal with the magazines they distribute AND they probably consider their mailing list to be 'sensitive data' so wouldn't tell you anything anyway !|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	There is something called The ABC List of Publications.  A hard copy is available in most town's central libraries, and quite a lot of other libraries as well.  BE WARNED, there are many more than you might think!!|`|zYQtUuzmaa	The best place to look is in the magazines themselves. If you are submitting an article you need to make sure it caters to the magazines readership otherwise they won't look twice at it. You should select a few magazines that you think will like your article and pitch it to them rather than just sending it out to everybody. Hope I helped :)
19YfKNpJaa	Here are some suggestions:    a) actively seek out student musicians who will play for free.  Do you have four string instrument-playing friends?  There's your string quartet.  See if you can convince one of them to program your quartet on his senior recital, or something.      b) write chamber music for people you know.  Again, if you have friends who support new music, this is your avenue.  What performer wouldn't love to have a piece written specifically for him/her?  It'll increase your chances of getting performances if you already have a performer in mind when you write the piece.    c) I wouldn't count on a commission coming your way until you've already got a "buzz" about your name.  Now, on the other hand, if you follow my advice in (b) above, you might be able to call that a commission, if you can convince your friend to pay you in some way.  That may not be in money -- I've "commissioned" pieces from composer friends of mine for things like dinner at a nice restaurant, a bottle of scotch, etc.  Then I get to premiere a piece that has my name on it, and the composer gets a recording of the piece, and gets to add a "commissioned work" on his CV.    Overall, I'd say you should start small.  Go for small chamber pieces, or solo pieces.  I don't mean this to sound condescending, but a BMus degree in composition (regardless of how many honors) doesn't entitle you to performances.  There aren't many performers out there who are going to say, "well, this guy's got an undergrad degree in composition, so I should play his pieces." They'll need another reason to play (refer to (b) above, again).    I'm impressed that you've already gotten an amateur orchestra to read your symphony -- that's more than what most young composers are able to get without huge financial difficulties.  In general, you'll have better luck finding student musicians to play a piece for flute and piano than a paid orchestra who wants to put your piece on a program.  Or a violin concerto which requires not only the orchestra, but also a violinist who decides he'd rather learn your piece than a standard rep concerto.  But, if you can get some exposure by having small groups play your pieces, then there's more likely to be interest in your music.    Also, check out the competition scene.  If you win, you might get a cash prize, something good to put on a CV, and either a recording or a performance of your work.  Find every competition you can (reasonably...) and enter.    A website is a good idea, but I think that's more for getting people to hear MORE of your music than hearing any of it for the first time.  If you have a website, then you should give the address in program notes for any performances of your pieces.  Then the audience can say "hey, I liked that piece...I'll check out the website and listen to some more stuff."  You'll probably get more traffic this way then just by hoping people will come by chance.    Good luck -- I know this is a frustrating situation.|`|jR8kyp0Taa	Do you have a link to where I could listen to your symphony? I love to check out new music! I can also give my opinion if you like. I'll tell you whether or not I would buy a recording of it.     Boy Wonder    EDIT:  Mamianka, I don't care where you are in the food chain, as far as composers are concerned, a real composer writes not to be famous for it, but because it is his/her nature. You don't have to have your works published to enjoy them. Composing is joyful in itself, don't let your less-than-stellar talent stop you from doing things you love.|`|sc4BtGxGaa	Most of the dissemination of new music today is digital - did you write yours in Finale or Sibelius?  Each of those programs have a forum where s composers can post their work.  And, with digital composition, you do not need to worry about the quality of the performance - YOU control everything, down to the slightest rubato.  From there, people can purhcase download,s scores, parts.  It's a big world, and fill of people who can compose - and many more who THINK they can - so elbowing your way to the top of the heap is hardly easy.  I wish you luck.|`|NCMZy6Uqaa	I've seen young composers do things like:    - Introduce their work to student orchestras or chamber music  ensembles at conservatories or similar institutions.  - Look for festivals of contemporary music around the world.  - Look for composition contests around the world.     In these last two you usually send the score and a recording, and your work might get selected to be played and/or win a prize, but you should check submission protocol on each case.  There are some labels who specialize in contemporary music also. you could check on the internet, and ask them to consider your works for release.    My advice is, go international ;)|`|dpYMlxA4aa	Getting your music performed after you're out of school is the hardest thing for a young composer to do.    The easiest way to get performances is to hire musicians and rent a theater for your concert. Unfortunately that option can be very expensive.    Send your scores to competitions. most competitions give the winner at least one performance.    Send some scores and recordings to Orchestras. Youth orchestras, especially ones that have some kind of connection to you are often receptive to this.    Websites help. One of the first things people do these days to find out about people is use google, and if you have something up as opposed to nothing that can help.    There isn't really a protocol for this, just be polite and persistent.|`|95yt7QkIaa	I don't know for sure. If you want to present your music well, you have to have enough authority from other people like teachers, professors, and hold little  concerts so people can tell whether they like it or not. It is never a waste of money. There's plenty of oppurtunities.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	I know two composers...and they never had this problem initially... as far as the recordings are concerned, they played/recorded them themselves. couldn't you try that? surely you play if you've become a composer....
GrI8mCJyaa	Hmm...sounds the same or has a signature sound....I'll say both bands have that signature sounds that let you know who it is within the first few notes.    I say that is very different from 'every song sounding the same'....    BTW.....I'm sure alot of gay porn illustrations would be interested in buying your avatar pic.....just saying|`|AA11017714	Def Leppard|`|AA11343198	DJ Assault|`|yS61H04haa	AC/DC does sound like they are playing the same song over and over again. That is why I can't stand them.|`|hZegT1raaa	i think a lot of boston songs do sound the same, but this is so true of the dave matthews band|`|iIoCfIwXaa	Scouting for girls..... there a UK band and there shite!|`|en7Jr7qsaa	COLDPLAY *yawn*|`|FvEvFIW8aa	so you think a band should sound like a totally different band on every song on their album?     the reason most bands songs all sound the same is.........DERP because thats what type of music they play and the type they're fans want to hear from them, do you think AC/DC would have gotten to be such a huge band if they included spanish and hip hop songs in their albums? didnt think so|`|IatEdBpvaa	The Supersuckers.  After all, they had an album titled The Songs All Sound The Same.|`|YbmklSzGaa	I think all that "emo" music sounds the same. And the screamo.    Oh, and Nickelback.|`|LwqM7EHVaa	AC/DC.. I love them, but all their songs sound the same..|`|EWE5BMLKaa	Only looking at the question?... I would've guessed The Ramones|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	I think most of bon jovi's stuff sounds the same i still like it tho.all of aerosmiths stuff sounds similar not the same tho.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	mm i dont think acdc's song sound all the same its just that brian johnsons voice is so distinctive.     i thinkkkkk every emo song sounds EXACTLY alike. there is no difference between one or the other.|`|1e3gBZY9aa	I think they both sound the same.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I didn't like Boston for the same reason when they came out.  They were a breath of fresh air during the disco period but too much the same.|`|mQHJIAdTaa	nah not all boston sounds the same... but NICKELBACK does....
Um8osMNuaa	Anybody besides that talentless Beckham woman, the show just won't be worth watching if we have to see her pouting and b!tching for top dog position with that other just as talentless Cole woman.    l'd like to see Sharon back, her and Louie make a great double act.|`|eBHQBeF7aa	Charlotte Church or Duffy.|`|Gj47yTKvaa	Mel B    I love Mel B she has the personality and experience for it|`|NPtz1Y4Taa	ME as i need the money lol  have a nice day and i wouldnt b s|`|c4cfa82feca12657ebdf40e2d14cd893aa	Lets have sharon back|`|0VHolTVEaa	I would like to see Sharon Osbourne come back she was great. Although if Victoria Beckham did it there would be so much bitchyness between her and Cheryl|`|iddMxOroaa	Baby spice or sporty spice, they were the only two who showed some talent|`|fynzkVK4aa	I think Charlotte Church would be great.  She has been in the business a long time so knows her stuff, is very down to earth and isn't afraid to speak her mind, but at the same time she can be honest without coming across as nasty or catty.    Myleene Klass would be a good choice too but I think sometimes Myleene might be a bit scared to be totally honest if someone was really bad, whereas Charlotte would be honest without trying to hurt their feelings.|`|GjsLzmNAaa	Well i've heard it's going to be posh spice.. which will be awful lol.. also i've heard charlotte church and lilly allen.. but both of them have had fueds with cheryl cole so that would be interesting.. I don't want them to replace Danni but if they do someone like Mel B would be good like the other person said : )|`|98zzi4w8aa	Bring Sharon Back !  Though Ozzie Osbourne Would Be Hilarious xD|`|LWXMUmFOaa	lily allen|`|8mQVfDRqaa	I'd love to see Sharon back! :)|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	None of those especially Myleene Klass (sick of the sight of her).|`|0v7Msiznaa	charlotte church she would be great and she would also speak her mind.
eUFsTmlsaa	After Hours by We Are Scientists...Mad weird but pretty sweet:)|`|bAp35x7uaa	LOL, it's After Hours by We Are Scientists... genius!      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv2_LSIuj...
y5dwVEK5aa	girl you need to drop him   he aint worth all that an your still young|`|FhKfyxWlaa	I don't think that female friend is just a friend...I think its physical.  Assume its done, and move on with your life. Don't make the same mistake that I made and wait around for ten years, playing the on again off again thing.  Aquarius guys can be really selfish bastards. Sorry, but that's the truth.  It's all about them and what they want and your feelings don't really matter all that much.  Don't sit around by the phone.  Don't call him or text him. Just move on.|`|B7WIZdglaa	I would say that you sort of move on in a sense. I mean, atleast act that way. Aquarians like a catch, so be one for him. If he says "oh im going on a road trip w/my gal pal" .. act excited for him and tell him you hope he has fun (as much as that will sting). The more aloof you act, the more he will probably come around. Don't really call him, just text him randomly. If you start being aloof, and that pushes him away even more- and he totally stops talking to you, well then it just wasnt meant to be. I've actually never had this problem w/an aquarius- I had it with a virgo sun and gemini moon. I felt like I was constantly chasing him. When we were together he would act like he liked me.. but he would never call when he said he would, and when he did he was always "at a party" or "out with friends".. I was always thinking... why didnt you invite me?! Sometimes 2 people are on 2 totally different levels when it comes to relationships. Just live your life, keep yourself busy, and im sure your aqua will come back around.|`|AA10423276	i think he's going out with someone else. i think he just wants to be friends with you now or he didn't like the way you kiss.|`|ed3eK4mHaa	I think he's kind of lost interest, which is sad, because you're a Gemini and a great match for him. However, Aquarians can be very aloof. I would give you this advice: let it go. Totally let it go. Don't call him. Don't chase him. Become very happy, satisfied, and move on with your life. It is possible he will drift back to you after this road trip girl doesn't pan out. It's also possible he won't. Your best bet is to let him go. Don't go back for "closure" because he will find that trite and annoying. Just let it go. Let him chase you. If he isn't chasing, he isn't interested, and it has nothing to do with you. It's because he's feeling disatisfied with himself, so let him. You find other things to do.|`|2VNmxfgpaa	Well, it's hard to give you better advice than Shellie who so articulately and senstively recommended leaving him be...     But then I sure agree with Marina that to Aquarius, your feelings don't matter and they are self-centered....    Since you already have such great advice all I can do is come on as a sympathizing partner of an aloof Aquarian who does everything to please but winds up in the cold all time.  Aquarius - ARGH!  You said it.  And guess what - after you give up, he might even show up acting like he likes you again!   Leave him be.  If he pursues you, and by chance you date, be ready for his intimacy levels to swing like a pendulum.  You'll wonder where you stand all the time.  If you don't want to surf looking for experienced people, well, you've got another one.  Best wishes.|`|FauWi8zRaa	I`m aquariun male.............. he seems to me is testing the waters............ us aquarius men don`t like to show and deal with emotions..... if he enters the relationship and you break up with him that would hurt and we don`t deal with emotions to well.|`|GntonLeQaa	Most Aquarians are free and easy spirits....they are independent, rebellious to commitment and they especially like their freedom....freedom to come and go as they please without having to explain their actions.  I think he is testing you and you need to consider him only a friend until HE shows more interest by taking action to make your relationship stronger.....

Anyone heard from Doris about Monday's Dr. appointment for Pete?    It feels good to look forward to some 40 degree temps. Weatherman says they will be temporary.

dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	It's no tie... LeD ZePPeLiN|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Motley Crue or Def Leopard|`|5G4cRjA5aa	That depends - are you talking commercial success or personal preference?    Commerically, I think it's AC/DC. "Back in Black" is the second biggest selling album of all time with 42m copies.    Personally, I have not found a band that I consider as the "greatest rock band ever". But I'm only sixteen, I've got another few decades to do so :).    Mikhaela|`|XhJuHMwQaa	Led Zeppelin for sure.  AC/DC maybe.  Why Guns N' Roses?  Because they had one good album?|`|LwqM7EHVaa	The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Cream, and Pink Floyd.. These are the greatest rock bands ever..|`|EWE5BMLKaa	Devo    They have inspired/influenced as many bands as the above mentioned.  They are also a band based on substance, not a band lucky enough to write one good album and have the world remember them for that.|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	Prolly The Rolling Stones or The Who or Blue Cheer.|`|c3DqvgE4aa	QUEEN|`|AA11111862	For me its a tie between Motley Crue & AC/DC.  I never really listened to Led Zepplin much- besides Stairway to Heaven of course .|`|0ef851000b538b263ac2c3058c608291aa	kings of leon  rolling stones|`|8Hlvv8a4aa	The Band|`|AA10723498	For my age group it's Buddy Holly.  He was killed tragically along with the rest of his band in a plane crash.  You should look it up on the web,  He was well loved.|`|FbZcM1nlaa	I would say Queen definitley. Guns and roses back then when they had a decent album, (But they kinda suck now) Led Zppelin, Van Halen, AC/DC, there are to many good ones, but I would go with Queen probably.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	I agree with your first two, but GnR? They had like, one good album right?|`|vZxrQh4Jaa	OMG AGREE ! I love 80's metal most   Iron Maiden, Def Leppard .. yea I'm weird..     But I love AC/DC most.|`|LoGtEsi9aa	Metallica.    =]|`|AA11656797	Pearl Jam.|`|MX7eJqfFaa	TOO MANY FOR ONE TO BE THE BEST!    If I where to pick Led Zeppelin would be my all-time favorite though|`|RcmdFIyyaa	Yeah, they're all great, but...                                                            Aerosmith! Are the greatest rock band of all time! When they were inducted to the Rockn' Roll hall of fame, they had a song on the radio at that EXACT moment. This is the only band this has ever happened to. And plus they have a Guitar Hero game!|`|ZZT85PQUaa	Avenged sevenfold|`|7e632a04dd178e071e54add9fb9eb945aa	Led Zeppelin and the Stones are both up there.  AC/DC has the right attitude, but not really as many big hits as ZEP or the Stones.  The Who can be in there somewhere as well.|`|317c7fb02e7fb40c4a87b85cf3ea5106aa	ACDC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  but i love tokio hotel!!!!|`|7qWhyqJGaa	Led Zepplin, AC/DC, Rolling Stones, Queen and Pink floyd are the best!!! In my opinion I would have to say Queen.|`|BZKRfF10aa	QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|h0cidqaTaa	METALLICA!|`|LMUwz5y8aa	Metallica  Iron maiden  AC/DC|`|U2t6Pndhaa	Iron Maiden/Metallica/Judas Priest/Zeppelin Tie|`|EgW9LBF8aa	Alice Cooper|`|amXka9LDaa	red hot chilli peppers    Ac/dc    led zeppelin    black sabbath    boston    kansas    metallica    pink floyd    Rush    VAN HALEN    U2    The who    Wolfmother    ZZ top|`|Cppi6kRFaa	This is more of an opinion question but in my opinion the greatest is Black Sabbath (Ozzy's version). They influenced every hard rock, metal, thrash, goth, and doom band that ever played a power chord! But even Ozzy said he was a huge fan of the beatles so again its all a matter of opinion.|`|aUbxn1eYaa	Linkin Park And Lost Prophets All The Wayyyyyy!|`|7SJJ2xtWaa	Van Halen, Aerosmith, ZZ Top, The Who, Led Zeppelin, and Queen.
HjFisSCXaa	You can watch it here too:  http://www.surfthechannel.com/episode/66...|`|3jhUTJedaa	i wouldn't watch it ...the movie that it's based on is so much better, called "The shop around the corner" but it's an old movie.|`|a9HULbDKaa	check    watch-movies-links.com|`|Or1FSQxKaa	You can but I wouldn't recommend it - it's rubs!|`|WpqfQOTJaa	We've got the VHS of it.

UOzty1bGaa	honey i don' think it's such a good idea well according to sun sign rules it's not a good match but there are always exceptions....
Um8osMNuaa	l watched them all when they were first shown, it was something a little different to all the other programmes that were on at the time. Plus l like the alien type shows, like X Files and 4400.|`|4Ef8yCbfaa	Its not bad. I`m liking the story so far.|`|h8I9gOihaa	Yes.It is OK but I really love "Two and a half men" .They are hilarious!|`|btrMdy5Uaa	Are you talking about the Roswell show that was on like 10 yrs ago with Kathryn Heigel? I loved that show! I watched most of them when it was on, maybe I'll find it on Netflix and start watching again!|`|wsCBo2Zkaa	I loved Roswell!!! I have all 3 seasons on DVD. Season 3 is my fave, i love the last ever ep but i won't spoil anything for you!!! Max & Liz are my fave characters, their the perfect couple!!! Tho i love Maria too, she makes me laugh!!! Lisa Michelle x x lol x x
PgFYPZg2aa	I find him pretty entertaining, the whole out breath over dramatic dialogue makes the whole show much funnier than it is intended..."oooo I'll save that for later, for now I need to make it to the tree line before nightfall to avoid being stuck in sudden violent storms that kill over twenty people in this region every year.  Just last year a group of nuns were having a picnic on a rock near here when a lightning storm came in with no warning...and they were never seen or heard from again"....lol|`|eiEdUWNbaa	I prefer Les Stroud, Survivor Man.|`|MBqSntreaa	I like watching him eat various animals and then proclaiming about their enormous amounts of protein.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	i have watched him and i think he's a bit of a prick... lets all drink water that you know an animal has pissed in.|`|HNnVrvCfaa	I love it.  I particularly enjoyed the episode where he was given a dead camel (to demonstrate that if you're lost in the desert you should kill your camel) and he cut it open and climb inside it's carcass.  He also skinned it and used it's fur as a cover.  Oh and he cut open it's organs and drank it's water supply.  Was rather entertaining.|`|a6f1adc3e857cef18f7615f6ae435f72aa	No, He's a knob. Watch Bruce Parry instead.|`|AA12270117	Yes he is very very sexy.

XCVFEAC8aa	they might, cause the movies are a big hit and they might just call it College Musical, instead!    idk we will find out soon!|`|h84uIkZOaa	that wouldn't be called high school musical anymore. college musical???|`|AhqTR4Ljaa	they are in fact doing high school musical 4 but its gonna be a new group of kids, they are doing a reality tv show now to find the cast|`|NkEVxk5iaa	There is going to be a number 4, but I am not sure if it will have the origonal cast though.  I know that it has the English girl from the third one though.  :)|`|QGkaMovlaa	hope so|`|fa4n8rpGaa	They'll keep it going as long as the $ keeps rolling in.|`|XZfdLVu5aa	There is gonna be a High School Musical 4 but it'll have a new cast. Some of which were introduced in HSM3...remember that annoying we boy that was into Sharpay and the Sharpay min-me?     oooh its not looking good lol|`|KGZlxhAVaa	NO they introduced a new cast of people who were freshman in highschool musical 3. These ne ppl will be the main characters for highschool musical 4 , 5 and 6
I6dcRgD6aa	I didn't notice but I think it was ridiculous for him to be in the competition. If he is talented his Uncle Donny & Aunt Marie & would have been able to get him jobs. Even if he wasn't talented they surely know many people who would put him on their shows. I think it was the wrong place for him anyway. I know Jordan Sparks' father is or was an NFL player. She can afford to go out & get a career without competing with the average Jane & Joe. To me the show is about that girl like Kelly Pickler or Fantasia or Reuben or Clay. I like to see people who would have never got any recognition to show what they can do. It shows that poor people have so much to offer in so many ways if they just had the opportunity. Than we have people like Paris Hilton in our face all the time. I am glad Osmond is off but he probably forgot the words that is why most got kicked off. The only black guy who was shocked (the one who saw evil in Paula's eyes) she evidently thought he was hitting the notes too high cause they showed her reaction. I think they have some real talent this year though.|`|AA11111862	I don't think he should have been in the competition because just on family name  alone, he could have gotton  a record deal. I think this competition should be for people who need real help getting into the business & know that this is their only way.  But he was an okay singer. Not bad. I think he did just get cut because he wasn't a great singer. Put it this way, if he was so great they would have showed him singing last night.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	Yes he certainly had talent and the good looks but like you said he was already ahead of the game and had the Osmond's connections for him to get ahead.  Maybe he was trying to do it on his own but that show isn't for pros its for amateurs like you said that have raw talent that can be trained  and molded for the show.  Thats what makes the show great, watching how they do it.  David Osmond will do fine and I'm sure we will see him.  Probably in the audience watching his uncle Donny Dancing With The Stars.  They are always promoting their own.|`|CofT1t1aaa	i think he got voted off due to the fact that he wasnt that great and there were others that were better than  him.    he was ok   but there were better ones|`|AA12390047	Guess he wasn't good enough in the judges eyes.  I'm glad he's out because there'd be too much controversy about a "fix".|`|Am1wfhBDaa	I think they read where many thought it was another Idol fix and let him go.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	I was not sure if he was gone or not. I think he was quite talented and he definitely deserved to go further than last night. He does have a future in this business Osmond or not. They passed Norman why would they let someone like him go?
5e7ae76d63cef0003f897d4f3907586daa	that's the only pic i've seen.    he looks hot    and also read that he won't marry her without a pre. nup. so i don't think he's after her .|`|6aw3naCNaa	OMG he's actually good looking!!    I watch Loose Woman and always wondered what he looks like.    she never shuts up about him.    I like Carol but you gotta wonder why someone his age is going with her.    I smell gold-digger!! Hope not though!!|`|0R5gf3Abaa	he looks like toby anstis|`|NkecUYMGaa	Some sponger nobody who'll bleed the old hag for every cent she's got.    Good luck to him I say.

AA11378593	Kiki's Delivery Service     In director Hayao Miyazaki's gentle, animated adventure, young witch Kiki (voiced by Kirsten Dunst) moves away from her family to practice her craft, but she finds that making friends in a new town is difficult. With her cat, Jiji (voiced by Phil Hartman), in tow, Kiki puts her broom flying skills to work for a baker's wife by starting an express delivery service. She quickly discovers, however, that she can't take her abilities for granted.|`|Or1FSQxKaa	Kiki's Delivery Service

Ea9A4yHNaa	I think you're meaning Steve Reich's "Early Works". The sound pieces are "It's Gonna Rain" and "Come Out" and the clapping piece is called of all things, "Clapping Music". This disc also has a piece called "Piano Phase". It's an amazing CD.    Please also check out some of his other works, such as "Music for 18 Musicians" and "City Life". Also, look into Philip Glass. I know Reich isn't technically jazz, but since you posted it here, you might also want to check out jazz artist Dave Brubeck. While neither one explores phasing, both Glass and Brubeck use unconventional meters, so they will give you another look at rhythm, much like the Reich pieces.    Please let me know if you like the other stuff, because I am 99.99% positive that I have found the CD you wanted. Enjoy!
Klw3Ke3Haa	I am not sure but you can probably try a blog site or use the power of google to find plenty of useful and helpful sites for you to use. Good Luck!|`|hMIXMpufaa	Not to be a downer or anything, but in the heavily watered down anime market (at least in its current state) Japanese companies are less likely to spend money on anime that isn't: shounen, BL or moe. Since I've never even heard of Crossover, chances are not a lot of other people have which greatly lower the chance of it become animated.
YNuyXl1waa	All of the syndicated "What's My Line?" episodes (1968-75) exist...but GSN rarely airs them, favoring the original 1950-67 version.    An incomplete listing of the 1968-75 episodes is on the tv.com website; the episode in question has been rerun a few times in the last couple of years.    Contact either GSN or FremantleMedia North America (the show's owners) and they might give you a digital copy (on DVD) since you were a contestant on that episode.

Y1aAGPURaa	I wondered why the baseball was getting bigger. Then it hit me.    Police were called to a daycare where a three-year-old was resisting a rest.    Did you hear about the guy whose whole left side was cut off? He's all right now.    The roundest knight at King Arthur's round table was Sir Cumference.    To write with a broken pencil is pointless.    When fish are in schools they sometimes take debate.    A thief who stole a calendar got twelve months.    A thief fell and broke his leg in wet cement. He became a hardened criminal.    Thieves who steal corn from a garden could be charged with stalking.    We'll never run out of math teachers because they always multiply.    When the smog lifts in Los Angeles, U C L A.    The math professor went crazy with the blackboard. He did a number on it.    The professor discovered that her theory of earthquakes was on shaky ground.    The dead batteries were given out free of charge.    If you take a laptop computer for a run you could jog your memory.    A dentist and a manicurist fought tooth and nail.    A bicycle can't stand alone; it is two tired.    The optometrist fell into his lens grinder and made a spectacle of himself.

When the daughters went to check in, they saw a really good looking bell boy. The father caught the three girls looking at him and he threatened to kill the bell boy if he did anything at all with them. So the bell boy minded his own business and ignored the girls.    While he was working ever so diligently, the eldest daughter goes up to him and says, "If you don't do it with me in bed, I will pour red juice on the sheets of my bed and tell my father that you popped my cherry."    Fearing for his life, he did it with her.     Then he saw the beautiful middle daughter in the hallway and she too walked over to him and said, "If you don't do it with me, I'll pour red juice on my bed and tell my father that you popped my cherry."    Again fearing for his life, he agreed.     Later that evening the youngest blonde daughter saw him. She walked up to him and said, "If you don't have sex with me, I'll pour green juice all over the bed and tell my father that you popped my cherry."    "Green juice?" He asked. "Why Green?"    She replied, "Because my cherry is not ripe yet, duh."|`|Cvcklfddaa	Look up Tim Vine    He's the man with the golden pun|`|NGO7v58haa	Guy 1 - I'll have you know that my mind works like lightning.

yRE2HDr3aa	Neil Peart by miles    Metallica is great but the drumming isn't exactly the strongest point. Plus Lar's drums sound like sh*t sometimes .|`|cbZdeOSPaa	Neil Peart :) Not that I don't like Lars but I like Peart's drumming much more.    Leprosy explained why!|`|9RTuRPviaa	Neil Peart. He is amazing. I'm not the biggest fan of Rush and i can still see that.|`|EWE5BMLKaa	Lars is mediocrity at it's finest      Tim Alexander beats out both|`|NC67WVlEaa	Peart! Have you seen the size of his drumset? I'd say it's about 4 times the size of a standard one.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	Full Disclosure:  I am a fan of both but I am a Rush fan first and foremost.    That being said,  Lars is neither as good or as bad as the posts here state.  Lars Ulrich is a very talented drummer - his rhythms are what drive all of Metallica's songs.  In the realm of 4/4, straight ahead metal he could hod his own with almost anyone.    Neil Peart has separated himself from the pack and can stand with nearly any percussionist anywhere.  His talent is for finding the hard way to do anything (just listen to Xanadu - in one part he has a hi hat hit going tap tap tap which doesn't match the rhythm of the rest of the drums.  Stuff like that is so hard to do).  He knows his own stuff so well that often times you will see he alters his sticking from tour to tour on the same song - I guess just to challenge himself.    Neil is a devoted Buddy Rich and Gene Kruppa (look em up if you don't know who they are) follower and has himself become a known name in the world of Jazz and big band percussion - both of which are generally much more advanced than any flavor of rock.    So yes, while I admit openly my own Rush fanboy status that doesn't mean I can't look at this objectively.    Between Lars & Neil - Neil is the stronger.|`|9BtA5Knfaa	NO QUESTION IN MY MIND, IT WAS AND WILL ALWAYS BE,    NIEL PEART       Probably the best Percussionist to EVER sit behind a drum set!!!!    Or at least in the top 5 in the WORLD!!!!|`|GrI8mCJyaa	Please.....is this a joke??    Neil Peart.    Lars can not even play a double-stroke roll.  He has not progressed in the art of percussion since 1989.  Blechhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!    Shame on you for such a question.|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	Keith Moon enters the arena and bashes their skulls in.|`|bribxhsdaa	Anyone who thinks Ulrich is better than Peart needs to be neutered as to stop their stupidity filtering down a generation.     To quote the Cheetos Cheetah on family guy "THERE IS NO ****ING DRUMMER BETTER THAN NEIL PEART"    I still like guys like Bonzo, Moon, Jordison etc. I think Bonham (Zep) was slightly better but Peart is one of the best to ever do it.    In a lot of cases, people who think Lars is better are Metallica fans/people who hate prog.    FYI - Lars still has major damage control to do on his rep as a drummer after the **** fest that was St. Anger. (I like lars but he fell off as of that album)|`|89xzNpVaaa	Both are great drummers but Neil Peart is a more experienced drummer, man!  Neil Peart started drumming for more than a decade before Lars Ulrich.  But anyway i love them both!|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Had you asked prior to the realease of The Black Album, I'd have gone with Lars. He used to be absolutely great. He may still be, but he stopped showcasing his talent on their albums long ago.   Even Deathmagnetic, with all its hype, has lame drumming. I mean, I gotta turn the treble almost all the way down cuz he just won't stay off that dang hi-hat. It's like one big woooooooosh... reminds me of trailer air-brakes.    Neil Peart by far. mlsgk nailed it. I've noticed that on many Rush songs...|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	Neil pearl. He made the pearl drum set.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Lars is a fine Metal-based drummer but Neil Peart can do just about anything he wants with a drum kit... Rock, Jazz, Fusion...

A9vxi8piaa	To make the battle easier, at least your level is more than 25. And then try to fuse Rakshasa. It ll be useful.    There are 3 enemies: Nice Guy, Though Guy, and Shadow Kanji. Nice guy as a healer & supporter, Though Guy & Shadow Kanji will attack ur party. So, kill the Nice Guy first. Dont use bufu becoz he absorbs ice. He ll use heat riser that can increase attack, defense & hit to Shadow Kanji.  Yosuke must dekaja him be4 he does something horrible. The tough guy will keep attackin you but dont get lure. You must focus beat Nice Guy. After defeatin it, you must fight Tough Guy. Most of his attack is phsyical, so Rakshasa is very useful because he can resist phsyical. Dont use phsyical attack & Agi because he absorbs them. After defeatin it, you can focus to main boss. Without his 2 servants, he is very weak. Keep attackin it and he doesnt have any weakness or strength to any element. When his HP is low, he will attack with Poison element. Use Dokudami Tea, Me Patra, or Posumudi. Dont forget to heal your partz|`|Ttf7867jaa	Not sure if this is what u are looking for... i didn't play this game.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDET0igyU...

That's "Rediculous"...    Nah i just find it funny how "Lose" and "Ridiculous" are some of the most common spelling errors.     Honestly, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out on your own since there are only so many sounds that can be made. Plus they only raise and drop in pitch.    I did "You are not alone" when i was in grade school on the Flutiphone......a cheaper version of a recorder.    Maybe you can try 8notes.com.....hopefully that will have it.

If you have given me detailed emotion, I could have pinned some of them down, but I might as well just give you bunch of them.   *My Chemical Romance*  Helena= Gerard and his band wrote this in memory of Gerard and Mikey's grandmother, but I've seen my friends change this song to something like when a guy leaves their lover.  Dead!= I'm not really sure how and why MCR wrote this song, but my friend and I have talked about it, and we guessed it's got to do with provoking someone who made an mistake at their love affair.   I'm Not Okay (I Promise)= This is one of my favorite song from MCR. They wrote this in meaning of their school life when they were kids. MCR band are like these geeks in school who gets bullied around. If you see the music video, they pay back to the jocks. The word "I'm not okay" symbolizes not being alright in the school being bullied.      *Linkin Park*  Given Up- Again, I'm not really sure why they wrote this, but I'm guessing they are showing their frustration to a person and they want them to end their misery.   Leave out All the Rest- If you see the Music Video and the interview, then you will be able to guess that the person that is leaving the lover (weather by dying or going somewhere else) wants to be remembered as a good person.     I would have written more, but these are the basic. If you were looking for a romantic yet powerful song, try Until the Day I die by Story of the Year. If you want more of the frustration showing song, try Famous Last Word by MCR or No More Sorrow by LP.

9rLi9pSRaa	You know I do think they read the blogs like you suggested and get ideas of who people like but it isn't the deciding factor.  I think David  was very good but he is not the ideal for the show.  I think the premise of the show is to take raw talent and mold it into a showpiece.  David already had the basics from his family and environment alone.  So he was ahead of the game.  Too bad because he is very talented but at least he got exposure and I'm sure his family will  ensure he gets the breaks he needs.  It was a good start for him but I am really glad he is gone.  Gives the others an even break.  Good for the judges deciding that.|`|QmSIsUZvaa	i dunno, but does n e 1 agree that he looked EXACTLY like David Cook, plus his name is David?|`|sVdQSMvJaa	With the last name Osmond why is the world does he need to go on an amatuer singing competition to get a record deal?  Won't a little family name dropping get him the music career he wants?|`|956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	I hate to be mean but although he was very good they have to be practical and be able to market him.  He was in a wheel chair with his MS 2 weeks before the auditions and unfortunately probably will be again.|`|KmC0K59taa	I was really disappointed he was let go.  He had one of the best voices!  They knew he was an Osmond.  They showed family clips when he auditioned.  Maybe too many people complained.  Still though, he deserved a fair shot.|`|tEmJT3hYaa	I think he was really good and I do not understand why he was thrown off the shoe. Confused!!!!!|`|yGHMC7G1aa	It was obviously a fix. He probably performed well, although we wouldn't know that because they didn't even show us the reason he was let go. I was hoping David would be the next American Idol, whether he is one of the thousands of Osmonds or not. I definitely think it was fixed.|`|Tq3v6jcTaa	I have to say I don't agree that David was not the ideal for the show.  Plenty of contestants (David Cook included) have made albums, sung concerts, and already had experience and exposure.  David Osmond's voice was definitely good enough for the top 36, and I think he tried out to see if he could make it without his family's help (he seemed really humble in the auditions).  I think the farce here is that they didn't show us his group number so we could see how he did.  Seems fishy to me, if he really was bad enough to be let go, I think they would have shown it.  If he did well, as usual, then they wouldn't show it because of the backlash for cutting him.  I don't know, but I don't think it looks fair.|`|AA12390047	Apparently he wasn't good enough in the judges eyes. I don't think there was a "fix" involved at all.

ehMPOlefaa	To directly answer the question, I think that the Simpsons themselves could very well admit this sort of a thing.  They are so irreverent that Bart or Homer could just basically say that they're not good anymore or that the family is a lot of crap.

"no, lady," the driver answers.

3vCrx4LHaa	Edit: I read the Comm. Guidelines, I don't think this site is Illegal, it's a Chinese version of Youtube, and is old. Still up too - if it is, and I am mistaken, my apologies and this can and should be removed. But I don't think so.  Hi! Sorry for the delay, below are part a and b of An American in Paris.  A: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjE1MzQ0Nj...  B: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjE1MzQ0Mz...  Have fun...  Hint about Youku: Let the movie parts buffer for a few minutes, it makes watching easier and without so many stops and starts. Also, to watch full screen press the square lower right hand corner. Youku buffers hard, but this is the best clearest copy of An Amer... so, just let it load, should be fine.|`|tLI94qWNaa	If its a classic you should own it, they are just too good not to have in a movie collection.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	No.    Buy the movie.|`|Zyl2wBnPaa	you can probably get it at the library|`|DEK6CQQQaa	I agree...It is illegal to "download online"|`|zV70m8eJaa	it's a great movie.    buying it would be better.

Leda2ha0aa	I was shocked as well as you.  I thought she was going to the end.    It seemed obvious that Leah was going to be the person to go next since she gave up at the Quick Fire challenge.  That makes me wonder (again) how they vote people off and what they take into consideration.    I think looking back, bot Jamie and Leah have about the same amount of wins under their belts. It was pretty shocking that she did leave on that note.|`|6AqFenaSaa	I was surprised too! Jamie seems a very capable chef and she seems willing to learn with every challenge. Leah, I think, should have been sent home because of how she treated Arianne a couple episodes ago (totally let her sink and then threw her under the bus at judging), because of the other challange where she didn't really do any cooking besides a [tomato??] salad and because she gave up in the quick-fire. I agree with the other guy on here that they are keeping her purely for the drama and love triangle nonsense with Hosea.     How many times has she screwed up skinning or de-boning a fish???     I'm no chef but I know if miso seems too heavy, you don't thin it out with butter! Of course it was too greasy...    Btw, I think Stefan should win. He's on-point for every challenge and although they played up his anti-team member shennigans, he still made amazing desserts (even though he wouldn't tell anyone what his plans were).|`|27jdKozNaa	I was shocked to but In Leah's defense her dish failed b/c she didn't understand how the sauce was made but her fish was cooked perfectly & Jamie's mistake was a pretty basic fundamental. If you leave a liquid to boil it will condense down & that's why the salt became so super saturated in the dish.     Remember the chick that got sent home in a previous season b/c she mixed lemon with dairy & why just on the last show Fabio at elimination was like "chef-acid (lemon usually) with cheese-please You work at an italian restaurant!"  that's b/c fundamentals in cooking tell you acid & dairy result in curdling...anyway I know that's a little off topic but basically I think they sent her home for a fundamental error & also b/c the Challenge was to see who could match their dish the closest. Leah's taste was there but the Constancy & eye appeal was lacking b/c of it's over oilinessss. They said in the beginning the person that was going to be elimintaed was the persons who's dish tasted furthest from the original & so yeah Jamie's salt killed it for her.     Also, yeah leah gave up in the quickfire challenge but that was only when the guest judge was like 10 seconds left & she knew the chances of winning at that point were slim to none & slim just left....Sh*t I probably would have thrown my hands up & been like F*ck it too LOL.     But yeah her attitude is going to hurt her in this competition in the long run IMO|`|ZA6O9qfBaa	I really liked her at first, especially since I am a Lesbian woman... but damn did she get nasty and unappreciative towards the end. In my opinion- they should have sent ALL THREE of them home!|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	Head to head, Jamie is a MUCH better chef than Leah. I'm bummed!|`|3L9bRmOqaa	Yes, I am VERY shocked!  I really though the final 3 would be Jamie, Stefan and Fabio.  I really wanted Hosea and/or Leah to be kicked off (more Leah).    Love affair?  More like cheaters in heat.|`|yYvFF2fDaa	I don't think she should have gone. I think Leah should go. I hate her.|`|QQbSIrBxaa	Honestly I am rooting for Hosea to win but would not be disappointed if Stephen or Fabio win.  If Leah wins I am going to stop watching Top Chef.  Seriously she has been in the bottom at least three times and has lucked out all three times because someone did just a little worst (in the judges' opinions at least).  After reading one of the comments explaining why they would kick Jamie off instead of Leah I guess I could see it, but I still think Leah should have gone home for not coming close to the actual dish and giving up during the quick fire.  At least Jamie knew how she could have fixed it and Leah had no idea!

7fEVNng5aa	Yes, I've read it numerous times. Don't worry, I'm not gonna yell and p*ss and moan 'cause you "didn't get it". The first time I read Watchmen I was disappointed, too. With all of the sub-plots, extra stories (like the pirate story), the excerpts from Hollis Masons autobiography, etc., it's easy to be overwhelmed the first time through. Or the second. Now, when I read it, I don't gloss over anything. All of the excerpts and asides add something to the overall story.    The pirate story is *not* irrelevant. If you pay attention to *where* the story is told (i.e. which panels the monologue takes place in) there are parallels between it and the rest of Watchmen. The pirate himself is an allegory for one of the main Watchmen characters (sorry, won't give spoilers).     Anyways, I don't know what else to say, except that I love it. It's a book I can read multiple time a year and not get tired of. It's full of interesting characters, ideas & situations. It's also beautifully written & drawn, IMO. Might be worth giving it another chance, especially before the movie comes out.    BTW, regarding the movie, I'm stoked and terrified at the same time. The previews all look fantastic so far. The Comedian looks great, Rorschach looks great, Doc Manhattans crystal palace on Mars gave me chills when I saw it and the overall mood seems right. I'm terrified because Hollywood has royally f*cked up Moores other works they decided to turn into "film". If they screw this one up Hollywood might be burned to the ground.    -----  Jimmy-   This is real literature, IMO. And that's not just delusional fan boy speak. Watchmen has been required reading in college courses, for example. There's alot more to it than guys in tights and capes.|`|9hCezzwRaa	Not a big fan of the Watchmen!  I have to agree with you.

When you're 15, sure, sure it's cool but when you've read real literature you realize this comic book is just a rip off of ______ except the main character can fly or whatever.    I suppose this doesn't help you one bit but I'm bored at work and felt like typing.    BA:  Shaft - Isaac Hayes|`|5G4cRjA5aa	I've read it, also in anticipation of the movie, and I'm halfway through reading it the second time (to understand it a bit more).    **SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T READ IT**    I didn't love it or hate it as such, but how was it clichd, may I ask? I like how (except for Dr. Manhatten) they were all actually human rather than all good, defying the usual connotations of a superhero. How Ozymandias turned out the be the bad guy in the end, for one thing (though I don't quite know how we got to that point in the first place, hence the re-read). I agree with you on the pirate story, that was irrelevant.    From what I've seen of the film, they seem to have translated the novel well. I'm looking forward to 6th March.    Mikhaela    BMA: David Bowie's "Heroes".

Lol|`|e2JxDMAZaa	nothing|`|3fPeyZaPaa	they better put out on the first date if they want a second one|`|AA10481463	Nothing, but casual conversation and laughter.  Just getting to know one another.  However, if a person is really hot, I just might let the date take the lead.|`|WVApZoBeaa	depends on how much i like him...but more then likely just a really long yummy kiss leaving him wanting more. but since i already gots a guy...we wouldn't even be on a date.    *offers you cookies* :) how bout you?|`|kej0H1AXaa	Put out or get out, that's my motto.|`|8IxC4MAyaa	maybe a good night if the mood is right.    ive only had sex on one first date, ended up dating the girl for the better part of 4 months til i started snow removal for the winter along with my regular job. then she didn't like waiting for me to get done with work and moved on...granted it was mostly based on sex. lol

k9DWHrJ7aa	i would, but the small town i live in doesn't have any, unless you count police/sheriff vehicles to transport you to jail.|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	I've hopped off the bus Gus, I would make new plans Stan, but I'd have to be coy Roy & drive myself strangers make me nervous.|`|E9ZLxgsOaa	In NYC yes.  In Nashville hell no.|`|y3Yu3DCDaa	the public transport in my country is not that well developed yet. but if it was, and i had a car, then i'd still chose public transport!! it's quicker and more environmentally friendly.|`|huONxcYxaa	hmmmm... probably yes:)  hoped i helped!|`|l6bUdWlqaa	In the city i live in,  i would perfer my own car, public transportation here take a very very long time to arrive to wherever place your going|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	in florida no in nyc yes|`|wEbB1FuNaa	The only places i would prefer public transportation would be NYC and San Fransisco|`|c3MFIbeUaa	I would as I carpool a lot in my area.   However living in a smaller town i am not afforded the luxury of city transport.   In the summer though i do ride my bike three miles to work.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Not where I live. But if we had a more efficient rail system I'd probably use that to get to other towns/cities. BUT since I work about a mile away from where I live that would just be silly. I also need my car for frequent and sporadic use during my work day.|`|c6HfikOHaa	no one i doubt in the uk its a disgrace|`|c6ff08c632b9e5165a8a3d098d3a1710aa	I wish ours was better|`|fkYQN5Xuaa	defo public transport cars are seen as an accessory to get girls here in ireland and they all twats playing banging loud music thinking they it  ill be "uncool" in my bus thank you...|`|sVFkMVujaa	we don't have any public transportation in my city.  besides, everything is spread out with great distances between places, so a car is a necessity.  if i lived in a big city with gridlock and very expensive parking lots, then i would consider public transportation. otherwise, no, not really.|`|PSk0zY5uaa	if i lived in NYC, Paris, London or something i would rather take pub. transportation|`|URO3gDXcaa	if it was available i would use it as long as there was a reasonable schedule.|`|uqLUKbMbaa	I like riding the bus.  I go for the back seat, in a corner where the heater is.  I get a nice comfortable ride there.  And if the journey is a long one, I take my iPod with me.  No worries about traffic.  Just sit back, take it easy and listen to the music.|`|THJCWCoMaa	weirdos are not my friends. I have no friends. So this said, I hate public transportation.|`|AA12278670	Me! I can't drive to save my life, so why endanger others? Plus, if I go everywhere with my parents already (them and me and my daughter), what's the use of having a car to just sit parked all the time? Why pay for insurance and make payments on a car I'd hardly use? No, I'd rather call the cab or take the bus when I NEED to go somewhere...it just makes more sense.|`|3q3bXWMFaa	when i was living in the city,yes but now that i'm in the country,riding the bus is tedious and too damn long so i'd prefer a car.  and also during school hours is best for me.
e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	They're popular because apparently there's an epidemic of stupid people who cannot figure out how to get their hands out from underneath a friggin' blanket.    Dave from TN makes me laugh.|`|5boLbxzdaa	For the same reasons people collected Beanie Babies.      Freaking morons!    Talk about pissing  your money away!|`|PMQWI1Ojaa	It's a blanket with sleeves.

m2UUrurBaa	i've heard of the name, but never looked into their style of music, like gnarls barkley's crew.     Lead singer looks like a Low budget black ultimate warrior. song is tough though    pharell suffers from the peter pan complex    Who the hell dates via myspace? lol, but blind dates are fun, especially if you go on a double blind date, because you and your boy can make inside jokes the whole time if shorty is busted.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	I've never heard of the band. He looks like a mix between a mystical animal and Wilder Valderrama.     He looks like this white guy I used to know, only like an alien too.     Good luck!|`|bribxhsdaa	Never heard of them. I'm at work so i can't view Youtube.    What genre are they?    Considering Pharrell doesn't look 35, It's not as weird as you'd initially think. But if you know how old he is, It's not more sad than weird.    I've never been on a date with a girl via Myspace. I like picking up women I can actually see/smell. I always thought people who exclusively picked up birds via internet had gab issues.    Isn't a blind date no better than an internet date? Considering you can't exactly confirm what they girl in question looks like?    However Big W is on the one for how blind dates can be hilarious.|`|42a3494c4c91e3621ec36d45d2b2ef4faa	lol...  i think its kinda sad that most communication today is thru Myspace.. never been on a date, but i know what u mean  and yeah, i think Pharrell found the Fountain of Youth, he just dont wanna tell anyone|`|6fxr3VBGaa	What's wrong with Pharrell? lol|`|aJfBtT9iaa	1. No i have not and yes he looks like a gay werewolf  2. he dont really look like hes 35 so i guess its ok.  3. I guess... u actually met women on myspace? wtf lol

Well, guess what I'm not into prejudice neither discrimination and in fact my little brother is cross eyed and I have no problem with it, because it doesn't bother me and it's not his fault! He's cross eyed because of genetics...

uUzbqGh5aa	Nick should tell Phyllis and see where things go from there.|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I haven't been watching Y&R for long, but I don't like the idea of anybody sleeping with someone's spouse. Of course it is a soap opera and it makes good drama. I don't like Sharon and Nick togethert.|`|3q3bXWMFaa	they get up and take a shower :)  we both know that Phyllis is gonna kill that heifer when she finds out.  Phyllis is gonna go back to being that crazy "b" that everyone has come to know and love,and kill Sharon.  but then again Phyllis knew this was gonna happen since she was the one who did it to Sharon.  but i myself can't wait to see how this plays out.|`|fcPiQDwEaa	After Nick tells Phyllis what happened and Sharon turns her love interest elsewhere as has been reported in the spoilers, who knows what will happen, should be interesting though.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	Nick will feel guilty when he goes home to see Summer, but Phyllis will push him further away w/ all her rantings, right back into Sharon's arms.

fcPiQDwEaa	I don't know, but l'm looking forward to seeing that today. I'll miss Brad.|`|YJlCKreSaa	A woman|`|955YoHvVaa	That happens on todays episode and I know Colleen or JT doesn't because they are going to be talking and hear a scream and then they will go down in the woods and find him..|`|Xc02z608aa	SPOILER*********************************...

AA12315431	It is getting old very fast. I understand PPD is a very serious medical condition but I had no idea it made you crazy and forgetful as well. Good to know since I am pregnant.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	She probably did leave the baby with Audrey  and I too would not put it past her to just lose the baby in the snow..then again not intentionally because   she was frozen and not thinking straight.|`|fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	I'm thinking somebody kidnapped her.    I think that Robin has been trying to get a-hold of somebody ... but because of the stuff going on at the hospital (with nobody seeming to be able to get through, and nobody being allowed to go in or out), she couldn't get through herself.  Any ambulance attendants wouldn't have been allowed to come out, anyway.  They''re already threatening to shoot anybody who even TRIES to get out.    Patrick was stressing the other day that the baby is sick, Robin doesn't know what's going on with the hospital because the lines are down, and he knows she might try to get Emma there and put them both at risk.|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	This whole Robin storyline is getting on my nerves. Who takes a baby out in a blizzard? And then wraps the baby in a light receiving blanket and starts walking. Plus they don't live in the woods, so why didn't she stay on the street? Robin is a doctor. She knows that for a fever, you give acetaminophen (Tylenol). My son's pediatrician has an answering service 24 hours a day, and so does every pediatrician I've ever heard of. I know, I know it's a tv show, but I am so annoyed by the whole thing! The writers really need to do an about face here, because this is so stupid.|`|sJs0nuTSaa	On my Wednesday episode, she still has Emma.  I doubt the writers will have something happen to her.  She probably stumbles across a store or something and leaves her there to keep looking for help, and just doesn't remember.  Hopefully!  But, even with the storm, an ambulance would have arrived sooner or later and taken the baby to Mercy Hospital.  It was dumb to go out in a storm if you don't really know the area.  However, we already know she's not thinking clearly.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	Yesterday it ended with Robin taking Emma out of the carrier and she was heading down the road in a blizzard.  And all I could do was shake my head...    Supposedly she's going to drop the baby off at Audrey's and forgets she does...Johnny and Lulu will find her.    I'm so frustrated by the Robin storyline....That baby was crying it's head off yesterday and I wanted to jump through my computer and pick her up!  I know they are trying to portray what a mother with PPD goes through...KM is obviously doing a great job because she has me yelling at the  TV "GET HELP ALREADY"!!|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	I don't get why Robin was like "I thought there was a gas station over here, but I guess not." She's been living in Port Charles for like her whole life (expect for her time in France). So why is she getting lost? She wasn't swerving on the road or anything either. Robin needs help. Her sick baby needs more than a coat and blanket.|`|6Ch7vbKfaa	I am soo SICK of this storyline!  Robyn is smart and this is what she is reduced to??? How ridiculous.  It is testing my nerves....|`|tgVGE2Umaa	This storyline is pushing my buttons, Robin has always been great with children. But to answer your question, I wouldn't be surprised if she just laid her in the snow with the way she has been acting lately.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Yeah I agree but she is sick.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	As of yesterday's episode, Robin still had Emma and was trying to walk for help in the blizzard.  Her storyline is horrible and Robin is so annoying.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I read on some sites and in magazines that she left Emma with Audrey Hardy, Elizabeth's grandma and then went out for help.|`|230NbPVUaa	She still had her at the end of yesterday's episode, she had taken her out of her carrier and wrapped her in a blanket and was holding her as she was walking through the snow.. but watching the commercials it looks like she might lose her|`|ppE0GtkIaa	Robin is a BIG AZZ and a ROTTEN MOTHER to that poor baby. I hope someone did take that baby and it will teach that B*TCH to be a better mother and snap out of that PPD. Did you see her yelling at Emma and Emma was screaming. I would cry and scream like that if I had a stupid pathetic mother like her. But, Boy does Emma have a good set of lungs on her...lol I hate ROBIN, There is nothing great about her on or off screen.
gakFjZfdaa	I did!!! That was "Classic Mrs. C"|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i know she was being really rude?|`|lXwIx74xaa	i wish that they will be done with her story line soon. it's boring.|`|CyVxolNHaa	It was the Alzheimers speaking, but yeah, it was a classic, but u just gotta love her though!LOL!|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	She is an awesome gal, always!!  What a wonderful actress she is.    Bless Murphy's heart - he told her she would never be alone.  I love the two of them together!!|`|0ZfZulnzaa	Mrs C is awesome, she is a fiery ole gal and I can't wait to see her and Jill at it again!
Xc02z608aa	I've thought that as well, on and off.  I think it would keep things more interesting if Summer really is Nick Newman's.  That way Phyllis will always have a way to mess with Sharon.|`|lXwIx74xaa	i hope it's jack's. that would be jacked up though.|`|gakFjZfdaa	Yep I almost forgot about that one....Nick was the only person to see the results. I believe Summer is mos def Jack's. Maybe Nick is keeping the info b/c he wanted a daughter again to replace Cassie or b/c he's just doesn't care for Jack like Victor, and thinks Jack doesn't deserve anything.|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	I hope Summer is Jack's and Sharon & Nick get back together. I want Phyllis to go back and be the old Phyllis' that everyone loves to hate.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I think Summer is Jack's.    I don't really care what Phyllis thinks about "Nick's calculated betrayal" because she is such a calculating, betraying tramp.  I think she is about to get what's coming to her.    I stopped watching Y&R for awhile at one time.  I am trying to remember Sharon's rape you are talking about.  The only thing I knew was that she had dated a football player or something in high school (before she met Nick) and she had gotten pregnant by him (not sure if that was a rape) and gave the baby up for adoption.  That baby was Cassie who they later found as a little girl and got custody of her and started to raise her together.    I just read a spoiler - Sharon and Billy are gonna hit the sheets!!   Can you believe that??|`|fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	I think she's Jack's.  I can't say that Sharon would be "filled with glee" ... after all, she'll realize that Summer only knows Nick as her father.  If she's old enough to have bonded with Nick, then there's bound to be some heartache there whenever Phyllis undoubtedly decides to cut off all of her daughter's ties with him.  No matter how Sharon might view Phyllis, she wouldn't wish that on an innocent child.    I think Sharon might not be so mad at Nick, because he did what he did at a time when he had lost his own daughter and he probably saw Cassie in Summer.  I think Phyllis, on the other hand, might flip her wig!  Think PSYCHO in a dress!  I don't think she'll want to tell Jack at first ... if ever.  She'll start to remember Danny, the man who is not Daniel's biological father, but who still managed to take Daniel away from her because Phyllis had put his name on the birth certificate and because he could prove that Phyllis had lied and schemed against half of Genoa City, and had bamboozled him into thinking that Daniel WAS his!    Yep ... Phyllis will go into panic mode.  She's the one who told Nick the other week that she is the same person she's always been ... that he knew how she was when he got together with her.  That tells me right there that she's gonna do something she won't be able to turn back from.    EDIT:      I answered your question in good faith.  There was no need to call my answer out or get hostile with me.  If you only wanted people who echoed your sentiments to answer your questions, then you should've said so!  I do not come where I am not invited.  If you don't want Sharon fans to answer your questions ... then by all means say so.      I have never ONCE said that Sharon is a saint.  I have never heard any Sharon fans say that Sharon was a saint.  It's only those who hate Sharon who have accused those who respect Sharon of calling her a saint.  I challenge you to prove in any one of my questions (or answers) ... or any one of anybody else's questions (or answers) ... that we (Sharon fans) have said that Sharon was a saint!    I did not say that Phyllis was a psycho ... I leave that up to others who have witnessed her actions to interpret for themselves.  My exact words were, when Phyllis finds out ... "Think PSYCHO in a dress!"  I would certainly imagine that anybody in the real world who does the things that Phyllis does - or HAS done - would convey that mental image!    I'm not here to play games with people, OR to try to belittle how people feel about their favorite soap characters.  I leave that up to people whose questions are obvious ploys to call people out on their beliefs.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	I have a feeling Summer's Jack's....I thought that a long time ago.  Now the writers have the perfect reason to cut all of Nick's ties to Phyllis if they have Jack be Summer's daddy|`|YJlCKreSaa	I think Summer is Jack's child.  I remember that Nick only saw the results and I've always thought it would come out that Jack was really the father.  I don't know how Sharon would react.  Her scruples aren't much better so she would probably forgive him.
uwds1QuVaa	I think that would be fantastic if Sharon ended up pregnant with Nick's child!  It is time for them to be together again.  And I love Nick, but you're right - he is a cheater!!   He cheated on Sharon - numerous times - and now he's cheated on Phyllis as well.  You know what they say "once a cheater - always a cheater."  And that definitely applies to Nick.  And I think it would be fun for Phyllis and Jack to have another go around.|`|pnUGLB6xaa	I sure hope so it service her right|`|LO3BMobRaa	First off, if you saw them making love yesterday, you'll see why Nick is a prize, he's got the look and the body. I hope Sharon gets pregnant.|`|lXwIx74xaa	i hope so|`|XRPtuwoTaa	It will probably happen since the writers want to make Nick & Sharon the next Bo/Hope (Days)|`|msUIsv8maa	Yes i can see it he turned his back on sharon & he was married to her at the time|`|YJlCKreSaa	He left Sharon to be with Phyllis, so he may do the same to Phyllis.  I think Summer is Jack's child anyways, so hopefully that will come out soon.|`|rxk90e6Taa	Nick is hott!! Who would turn him down? Certainly not me! (as if I'd ever have the chance) LMAO    I don't think Sharon will be pregnant. But if she is Nick won't leave Phyllis because of that. He would leave her because of her lying, scheming and manipulating.  Besides Phyllis may not want to be with Nick once she found out they slept together. Her jealous rages may be too much to keep her cool whenever she hears Sharon's name.|`|955YoHvVaa	He turned his back on Sharon and Noah after Cassie died and Noah was still his son so it wouldn't shock me the least him doing it to Summer or Phyllis..I think Sharon will get preggy and then what Cassie said to him while dying will come true for them instead of for Phyllis and Nick to have a baby..|`|gakFjZfdaa	If it happens I see Nick turning his back on Phyllis. He will finally have another child of his own (maybe a girl this time). It's going to be a serious turn of events...remember Summer just may be Jack's child; Nick was the only one who saw the results.
SYYO3oozaa	It stays on beat for a while but once you transition to a different sound it goes offbeat.  Kind of repetitive too.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	no i dont think so.
yw6lUEU9aa	well, the episode was amazing !  First, with Meredith, you know the killer of the week before, well he died at the end, but not at the hospital. He had some organs which could be convinient for a the little sick boy. And so he tried to kill himself to die in the hospital and so to give it to the little boy. At least, that's what he pretend to do, and so Meredith didn't want to call Sheperd, because she was sure he wasnt' gonna let her "let her patient die" and he would have operated the patient, even if he's a bad man. But the little boy gets to live because someone else (miracle^^) in the hospital had the same organs and died. Meredith, at the end, went to see the patient's death (penalty, he was a serial killer remember) and so she's all shattered and can't stop crying, so Sheperd calls Christina and they kind of become friends again. Izzie !!!! i'm so sad. She knows now why Danny is here, it's because she's sick, really sick (tumor or something) and she's all upset and tell him not to come back anymore and he disappears, apparently forever. dR McSteamy has an embarassing problem (after doing IT with Lexie) and everybody kind of laughs at him and at the end Lexie stays with him anyway (i think she's faling deeply for him). Another great story is with Bailey. She has a really big hard moment to go through (she didn't sleep a lot and was desperate), she has to take care of the little sick boy and even wanted to stop the operation Sheperd was doing to save the killer's life to save the little boy's one. Unforgettable lines:    Derek (doing surgery on the killer): If I stop this surgery, it's the same as me sticking this scalpel into his brain. is that what you want?  Bailey: Yes. That's what I want.   Bailey: Dr. Shepherd?  Derek: Dr. Bailey.  Bailey: I need you to stop. I need you to put down the scalpel. This man is trying to kill himself and, God forgive me, I need you to let him    :D advice u to watch it !!!|`|7CsLJ4I8aa	There was no Grey's last week.

I was assured I would not have to remove my clothes - and I didn't.  Neither did any other invited guests.  It was rather unnerving though, because many of the ladies were extremely attractive in many ways.  I would rather not have attended, but I was there as Best Man.  How I came to be there as Best Man is another story for another day.  I still feel hot under the collar as I recall the event.|`|3q3bXWMFaa	ok i'd have to admit,i didn't know what a "naturist" was until i read everyone's answer and now that i know what it is....the answer is hell to the no!!!!|`|0CET3S3daa	Certainly will attend.....

Lmao|`|THJCWCoMaa	Its a shame your mom and dad didn't save for your plastic surgery. This would have helped, so I see your point.|`|ym04vDkcaa	your harsh nd y dont u save up for plastic surgery i bet YOU need it|`|N8998SBlaa	because you wanna wait for their reaction when they finally realize how hideous they are and start to cry...oh the anticipation...|`|AA12036375	Because you would probably get your a** kicked. I don't let anyone talk about my daughter in any way. She is beautiful though. All parents think their kids are the best looking. You would be asking for trouble.|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	because they let you grow up without informing your mom you was ugly so do unto others as they have done into you|`|GRyFxwTbaa	Sure, but make sure you've developed ninja-like reflexes first, DG.|`|x7vB4P5Naa	HAHA!!! I bet most parents think their children are the best looking...even if they aren't!!!!  A friend of mine said she hopes her children become fat kids because...you know, nobody kidnaps fat kids!!!  Anyway.....|`|UL3sHgqNaa	That or you can get them acting lessons for those horror movies|`|rgA4jIsyaa	maybe the uglies are all herms, i think the yamster is on to something    frankly, i tell people all the time their kids are ugly, but i think the responsibility of telling the child lies on the parents...i mean telling somebody they are beautiful on the insides is only going to make them try to cut themselves open and see....    am i right???|`|nPt7hUE8aa	Of course! Honest is always the best policy.   The kids are gonna realize it on their own and wish their parents would have saved the money for them to fix it.|`|b11d4406389c926e8457572221d6ce48aa	Have you noticed the ones with the kids who can't properly close their mouths have the most pictures on facebook?

That is so not polite.  Suggest to them that they put the kids in a circus side show. When they make enough money from that, they can use the money to pay for the plastic surgery.  LOL.|`|AA11530601	cause its rude, itll make them feel bad, and its subjective. Wha u think is ugly someone else might think is beautiful. Just cause u think something, dosent mean u have to blurt it out.     If I did that all the time, id be in trouble! so yah, thats why    I know ur not serious anyway but - one day u might say it to the wrong person.....if u said it to that dad and hed 6ft 2 he might beat the crap outta you.|`|65637be5b6e62fe9ddf9ceed6a13d85daa	First thing is about the category suggested.  This yahoo answers favorite category  Tell you something?  Now your question>  Look in the mirror.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Of course it doesn't apply to me, my kids are gorgeous..  Because you value your tongue, and would like to keep in engaged in your head?|`|0p9wHjSWaa	The only reason I dont tell people their kids are looking is because I dont want to curse myself.|`|G2WgHzu5aa	I want a nose job and a new husband. This husband seems to think I am fine... *rolls eyes*    I am saving for both of my kids boob jobs because it seems they are not developing them quick enough. We will just have to see about lipo too. For some reason these plastic surgeons wont give an 11year old DD's (completely ridiculous)    Naturally I got the answer all wrong...  You should tell people that their children must be a genius to look as they do - if not they must start considering other options such as Plastic surgery. Momma told me to always tell the truth.|`|MBknatYtaa	My wife got upset with me when I mentioned that a kid we saw as we were in a store or someplace like that was one ugly kid. The parents were not within ear shot, it wasn't anyone we knew, but she said "you can't say a kid is ugly!" She did agree the kid was ugly after I asked, but she still insisted I can't say something like that.|`|nqlk9iUCaa	I HAVE KIDS?!!|`|QGP930C6aa	ummm... but nobody likes to admit they have ugly children since they look like them and all|`|3q3bXWMFaa	lol lol lol  you know that there's a special place for you in hell for making that comment.|`|c6HfikOHaa	i think that to a parent a child can never be ugly its not till they hit teens turn in hell children that you actually start to rate them|`|PD1WpoEsaa	lmao!! ive never thought about it quite that way....  but yeah, i guess youre right!! LOL|`|AraBfesHaa	Haven't you ever heard the song "Everything Is Beautiful (In It's own Way)"?  Have you ever heard "beauty's only skin deep"?  Have  you ever heard "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"?  Maybe you need to get  your eyes checked, then cash in your trust fund to get your own plastic surgery.    And may I add that no one has control over what they were born with.  You can mask it with make  up, but natural beauty is better.  So there's absoluteluy no need to insult people.  If you want to do that, aside from probably being "ugly" yourself on the outside, you need to improve on your inner beauty also!  Since you want to insult people because of the way they look, I'd like to ask you whether you think you're "ugly" or beautiful, and how you came to that conclusion, and how would you judge other people's looks, took?  Is it eye color, nose size, big/little ears, wrong color hair, breasts too big/too small, or what?  What makes YOU determine someone is "ugly"?|`|6qtuzvN1aa	My daughter doesn't want to invite certain girls from her class to her birthday party. When I looked at the class picture to see who they were, I could tell why. I'm making her invite them anyway. Even if they are homely looking. Everyone needs an ugly friend.

My job does not pay enough and I can't afford health insurance but that is about it. My family is healthy and for now we have a roof over our heads. Sure, I worry every day about whether or not all I have can be taken from me.    I look to the things that can affect me directly (loss of a job, illness, etc) and try & plan for them accordingly. I am not worried about anything else happening in other countries right now. They have their own governments to be there to help them out.    Are we going to survive (America)? Not unless we wake up, get slapped in the face with reality and significantly change our ways. Spending, waste, abuse etc. Most will come through OK I'd guess.

7WybdnLjaa	As far as I can understand, there were very low expectations for Anna Nicole Smith in general let alone her appearance, and I did hear people tease and joke about her often. I suppose there are more expectations for Simpson and Hewitt. Does that make it okay? Does it make it right? Not in the least. I think the entertainment "media" is much more influential than we give them credit for and I wouldn't hesitate to put some responsibility on their "heads" concerning the unhealthy images many believe are normal as far as weight and health go. I think they actually need to be reprimanded for a great many things really.... Here is the next question though...why is it women in the performing arts (as well as in most places) are more criticized for their weight and looks than men are? Double-standards...I hope one day they are a but a rare occurrence.
geJM58L2aa	I have the same problem as you.  My husband and I got married and moved into our town home together last October so we figured we needed to start a DVD collection so we could have some movie days.  Fortunately, we bought all of our DVDs at Walmart, mostly out of the $5 and $7 bins.  We have all types of movies - comedy, action, chick flicks, scary, you name it.  We actually have them organized into 2 sections.. Denzel Washington movies and then everything else, lol.  Everything else is in alphabetical order and then we have a section of 16 or 17 Denzel movies.    We were so excited to get all of these DVDs because we wouldn't have to re-watch any of them for a very long time.  Now it's completely changed.. we have a handful that we can watch over and over and the other ones just sit there collecting dust.    Do you buy a lot of movies you haven't seen before?  If so, maybe you should try renting the movie or finding reviews online before you buy it so you know whether you'd like to add it to your collection.  Or just try something like Netflix or that Redbox that's outside stores where you rent the movies for $1.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I have about 500 dvds, I just buy a lot of movies for 5 bucks at walmart, I don't buy things I wouldn't watch though, although there are about 20 movies I have bought that I haven't even seen yet, like Pulse, Silent Hill, Pearl Harbor, Saving Private Ryan, and The Sound Of Music|`|QWEJc4SZaa	I have about 300 DVDs. I keep them on some special shelves.|`|be0454b26052c43b82f9c56f20860acbaa	I have over 50, but now with redbox. I think I will just rent the movie for 1$ and not pay 20.00 thats a savings of 19.00. Then if it is worth it wait to u see it real cheap some were.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	I have about 1200 DVDs and I have them in albums. The boxes of the DVDs are in the basement.    I don't buy movies like "Twilight", "The Wedding Planer" or "The Day After Tomorrow". I collect classical movies. I have practically all Hitchcock movies, Audrey Hepburn movies, Stanley Kubrick movies, Coen Brothers movies etc. These are nice to have.|`|VCyY0WOQaa	i have over 150 dvds,|`|Pdex43zgaa	I have a collection of DVDs but I don't count them or keep an inventory. I know which ones I have. I used to buy them all the time, because I really love movies, but lately I haven't been buying any as most of the time I get them as gifts.|`|a1bc7b2add9196836f6fc478702f2b80aa	I probably have over 500 dvd/vhs movies. I wish I'd never gotten them. They take up WAY too much space and I hate to give them away after spending so much money on them. For me, I quit buying DVDs and went to a Netflix subscription. For the price of one DVD I get to watch about 12 a month. This way we always have something new to watch and I don't have to find a place to store it. It works for us. As for where my movies are stored now, are in storage cabinets, kinda like a kitchen pantry with shelves and doors.   Bethany

She said that when I was born,the 1st thing I did was sit up and smile.  Babies dont have the muscle tone to sit up unsupported til they are about 9 months old.  Ppl always celebrate "the 1st smile" so I guess that dosent happen til later either.   No idea why she had to gloss over the facts, its not as if being born is a cute baby competition.|`|frwlypDWaa	That when I was born, they didn't know who the mother was...|`|XxiHLifGaa	If you keep doing that with your eyes they will stay like that.*|`|0p9wHjSWaa	Michael Bolton was a good musician.|`|QEqGukjZaa	i will turn into a woman..|`|IizPFrELaa	And I'm not blind...|`|DjbCw7ePaa	"You're the prettiest girl in the world."|`|fkYQN5Xuaa	if you dont eat the crusts of your bread then you ll nevr grow chest|`|3q3bXWMFaa	when all of her answers ended in "BECAUSE I SAID SO"|`|G2WgHzu5aa	She told me that sex was only for making babbies.|`|62Dk8fJDaa	If you stand on your head after sex, you won't get pregnant...    6 kids later....|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Childbirth is a piece of cake  I guarentee, there wern't no cake there|`|fguyiSIjaa	Only thing I can think if is the whole Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy thing.

Since...    There is a theory. During the bubonic plague, a sneeze was believed to be a sign of impending death. "God bless you" was "a way of commending his soul to the care of God." The phrase may have also come in handy to protect oneself if someone nearby sneezed.     Today, "bless you" is more a sign of good manners than a shield against death. If only folks were as courteous about other involuntary bodily functions...|`|3QzvVaTgaa	we say: "health!"|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Yep always do|`|wmBK9uASaa	Usually say "here have a tissue to mop it up"|`|DiBAWKPsaa	Yes, it's a force of habit (:|`|UmAM1cW8aa	No     I say     ***** you     he spread all the germs around me  ewwwwww bless me !|`|7SJ3cY48aa	It depends who sneezed :)|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Yes or Gesundheit|`|KkSW6EViaa	yes, everytime. just incase their brain falls out.    :)|`|AI4My948aa	I say, "cover ya bleedin' mouth, you pig bastard."|`|3SFxfoHEaa	yes i do, i count the sneezes too.  i sneeze when i am driving, it's the bloomin trees.|`|4CsGde1qaa	I say "God bless you" and nothing else|`|syBq8Yllaa	no...I'm not in a position to bless.

NZrjvKWjaa	Ghajini hangover. Still my mind shaking with it, No time for 'Luck By Chance'|`|wz8gx3gaaa	Second one.|`|mqA1Z75saa	Konkana Sen's character showed the real definition of success though she had her set backs which teaches  ~ This is life everyone makes mistakes  Farhan got what he wanted but at the expense of the ppl who loved him. SRK rounds up all !!    Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If we love what we are doing, we will be successful.|`|nPE7lYATaa	i havent seen any new movie after the release of Ghajini...|`|TrQ7auS1aa	Excellent question.......even i was thinking the same after watching the movie.......I think that movie says u decide what is important in ur life.....if u want success at any cost and want to b happy like farhan go that way,if u want to lead ur life perfectly with principles though not getting that success like konkana be happy like that..........    even i was confused after watchinh that movie.....it was a simple story...which we see in oureveryday lifes...we have to decide what we want and what makes us happy...  but one message which SRK gives in the end of the movie is to maintain ur old relationships(friends)in life as they  knew u when u were nobody.....|`|2mFfhIxOaa	It's a good movie & a good question too.  I think the movie want to say that be successful & popular but don't forget those people who were with you when you were nothing.  So when you become successful be with them becoz they are your true friends.|`|8wHg5MECaa	I do not have good luck by chance!|`|H93JbQS0aa	I loved it!! it was so much full of meaning went yesterday saw it park royal, yes it was orange wednesday!! lol     So anyway all them acheived something by using others!! there is no way out of it, its ok to be a little selfish to get some place but dont go so far that u totally misuse those whom u should really trust and stay good friends forever coz they only tell u the truth since they were with u in your bad and good times lol|`|I13rHn1Waa	(b)|`|oataqlMpaa	********** B ********|`|Z13dQrkuaa	B) You make your own definition of success - be happy & proud of whatever you have achieved in life - Konkana's character.|`|uApjEN9laa	not yet|`|mY26IlAaaa	No   Not yet|`|IxQzS9SEaa	you make your own definition of success - be happy & proud of whatever you have achieved in life - Konkana's character|`|EZ5GvAz0aa	try to achive what you want to. and be satisfied of what u have in the end, coz thts ur 100 %. in short, konkana's character a bit modified.|`|jpHK0nGgaa	i Saw The Movie & i Loved It .  i Am a Die Hard Indian Movie Fan & i Am Only 13 Years Old .  Well According To Me The Message Was   If You Want Something With a Burning Desire You Should Try & To Go Get It Because You Won't Succeed Until You Try & Fail & Keep Trying Over & Over .   That's What Gives You The Motivation To Move On & Keep Trying To Success .  You Just Can't Give Up .

Just because they ruin your **** doesn't mean you have the right to kill them. They were probably there before you.|`|f02fdd44028e78a86a13cf15a8da31e7aa	I agree with controlled hunting.   I don't agree with the wiping out of any species.  I didn't read the whole thing because it got boring but if no species is wiped out then I don't see any problem with hunting from land.     Hunting from air however isn't really hunting at all. The animal is at a disadvantage and it's pretty lazy on the hunters part.|`|BMYOukx5aa	If they are endangering someones livelihood by killing off their stock then nothing.|`|x2rmsjIXaa	it's one thing if you're taking down The Wolf that got a taste of YOUR live stock,and is hanging around .. . it's completely another to take out a wolf that you randomly found running around the tundra, to prevent him from 'possibly' taking out somebody's livestock in the future.|`|RLJJGZJnaa	Theyre another animal on the planet that are trying to survive? So what if theyre eating livestock, thats the way they get their food, put electric fences around your stupid livestock, its completely wrong to kill any animal just because they kill other animals, theyre a gorgeous thing, and they didnt do anything to you, so you shouldnt even have to ask such a question, anyone that can shoot a wolf from an plane is just plain sick.  No one should be able to do that.  It should definately 100% be illegal to do.    Im sorry,  But thats my opinion.|`|lLN8VD20aa	That's why 158 wolves voted for Barack Obama|`|jYmvtUC5aa	..unfair advantage.....get down to their level......hunt them as the ancient people did...with stealth and skill.....then I would say  the hunt is fair.......killing for killing sake is bestial.......killing with a purpose or for survival is another matter........  My sincere sorrow for your "livestock"....|`|sVFkMVujaa	and what about all the orlons and dacrons who gave their lives for your clothing?  do you ever think about them?|`|gu3GAFC9aa	That is terrifying sick way to die. I think everything has a right to live.  The biggest problems in the world are human beings, people have no respect for life. That wolf has as much right to live as you do. How would you like to be chased does and shot at and have nowhere to run or hide?|`|OXleDYVQaa	I own one and have lived with them, and to be fair to you, I get it. That doen't mean I think it's right to bounty them and hunt from an airplane, and that would be my thought in hunting anything.    As a species, unlike animals who hunt to survive, we as humans hunt for sport, or war, even each other, and often from aircraft, which makes no sense to me either.    Also had we as a species, not decided that encroaching on their turf (any other species) was for the good of man alone, we might have considered alternatives.    You did ask, and I offered an opinion.     Dallas

After it's all over, should anyone disagree with your singing, tell them that you didn't like their body either.  lol    You can do it.|`|AA10792562	Once you get the first couple of notes out, the rest will go fine.  Do the best you can, and no one can ask more.|`|TxIDLrjOaa	That why you are better in a duet, damn I wish I could get over my fear (of groups) but once I sang with one person I was so happy. I could sing in front of someone.|`|ycaloVnkaa	Dude stop thinking. Just go with it. Just jump into the deep end.|`|ZtaEg6mZaa	First of all pick a song to sing that you and your teacher both think is good for your range. Don't look at your classmates when you sing either, look at the back wall or at a poster or something.  I looked at one of my classmates once and I started laughing.     You can't really get courage... it just comes to you, if that makes any sense.

63a5e4aa71cbea07611f89f87df0073eaa	It's nice that you admire and want to emulate Jim Carrey.  He's a talented comedian and he's had some great successes.     If you are interested in learning how to be a stand-up comedian (which is where Jim Carrey got started), you should see if the local comedy club offers a class or has a connection with a comedian network that offers mentoring.    I wouldn't say it has all been sunshine and flowers for Jim, though.  His love life hasn't necessarily been that stable and I think the success has come at a cost that you might not want to pay.|`|bi8q08Iwaa	have a few screws lose but look smart doing stuff anyway. I love jim carry|`|5xIxQ5yfaa	be hilirious !!  dont be a skeptical//paranoid  try to be open//and just be ur self (if ur a funny person// just work on comedies/gags/jokes/facial expressions    ma advice is that, dont be like jim carrey even though u can take him as a role model but just be ur self!!!!|`|39v3cGrUaa	Good looking, funny faces, and most important...

That's just a bunch of lies.|`|1gHeBQCKaa	ummm, that's dumb!   There is no connection to NEEDING to get a boyfriend...|`|dnmXybF5aa	it means you can't masturbate anymore therefore you'll have to get a boyfriend because you broke your finger. its a joke. theyre making fun of you. duh. seriously how old are you

wsCBo2Zkaa	I think its very interesting at the minute. I find it rather creepy at times and its kinda scary when George morphes into his werewolf form. I like Mitchell he's quite dishy!!! Annie gets on my nerves a lil. Its quite a dark show and can be very violent at times but its still good. Just rather dark.

However, these TV sci-fi / fantasy programmes often cut corners in the "special effects" department.   Presumably because good quality CGI is expensive.|`|aScafPEOaa	Its quite good so far!   I'm one of these people who hate reality shows and wishes there was more 'fiction' programmes on so I'm hoping this will be good to actually let my mind wonder!

5418463416e8caa309a081dd29995b76aa	I agree with you, plus that woman gets everywhere.    I know we all have to take responsibility for our actions and decisions etc but is there any wonder women feel so much pressure to look a certain way and go to ever more extreme ways to achieve it.    Plus she evidently is just a 'face' for the show she has no knowledge or right to make a judgement on the way other women look - particularly when she is 'created' with her professional make up artists, stylists etc|`|LAdyqASxaa	Yes it is    But after watching Gok's show a few weeks ago in a sense he could be called a "hypocrite" as well, he lost all that weight due to being unhappy with his body and now he tells averagely sized women that they look fine and shouldn't diet.    But Myleen will maybe use some of the techniques she learnt from Miss Naked Beauty with 10YY, but with 10YY, the women know that they will be going to get the surgery, whereas when she did the show with Gok, there was no surgery included|`|76a2abe8e583e9295d0577810103916baa	Yeah...She is a bit.|`|Q7Sy9Cnraa	Yep,..i agree with you !     One minute she is fronting a Show to keep looking Natural,..then the next one is advocating Plastic Surgery just to look "Good"!    She's probably cashing in on her new "Fame" since doing the Jungle Show a few years back.    Since then,..she has had a Baby(who i doubt she hardly see's!) and seems to pop-up everywhere on the Box!    Numerous TV Ads and Chat Shows. I'm getting sick of seeing her! ;0    She needs to slow down and spend time at home with her young Baby, partner and Family.|`|DtU1EpoVaa	I agree she is being hypocritical. She seems to be on everything at the moment   My the pay is really good and that why she is doing it.|`|VcKKXFtNaa	Urgh... i find her to be kind of alien.

1eiPSIydaa	You'll need a full size keyboard with 88 Keys that have weighted hammer action.  This will help it 'feel' like a real piano to some extent and will be invaluable if you want to learn full piano keyboard techniques.    I use a Studiologic SL990  http://www.studiologic.net/sl-990PRO.htm...    BUT this one doesn't have sounds - you have to connect it to a sound generator or Computer with audio software.    The Yamaha DGX530  you mentioned looks really good.  Right sized keyboard etc.    I would NOT recommend the YPG235 because it's not full sized (only 76 keys)    Good luck

bea44d4bb85275e95bee4156a827f611aa	The Kinks cause I like to get kinky!|`|SaxjkMbSaa	The Kinks -- I was already a teenager when they became popular in the US circa '64/65 and remember that " You Really Got Me " and " All Day and All of the Night " were 2 of the " grooviest " songs out then.|`|nU7yv87Vaa	Wow, not much love for The Yardbirds at all... they're my third favorite band, so not surprisingly, that's my answer. Of course there was the succession of immensely talented guitarists, but it seems not many people appreciate everything else the band had to offer. Keith Relf was an amazing songwriter/lyricist and harmonica player, and though he may not have been the most talented singer ever, he was certainly unique and could do a variety of types of songs. Jim McCarty was (and is) a fabulous drummer and is highly underrated, just like Chris Dreja at bass and Paul Samwell-Smith as a producer. I find myself bored with Kinks songs somewhat easily, but The Yardbirds have so much variation in the music they played I could never tire. They not only built upon the blues but helped set the foundations for metal, psychedelia, and even prog. They were so innovative in guitar and studio techniques, too. For me, it's absolutely no contest, and I wish more people would see what was so great about the band.|`|YbmklSzGaa	The Kinks|`|euZRbiA2aa	The Kinks overall but for your love by the yardbirds is one of my favourite songs.|`|6EoAKcMwaa	I love the Kinks.|`|87CAVhs2aa	The Kinks!|`|KHUEkyNaaa	The kinks were more popular, but The Yardbirds had better musicians including the likes of Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton three of the best guitarists Ever!

But I'd go with The Kinks..|`|89xzNpVaaa	The Kinks, trust me, mostly people start listening to The Yardbirds because of Jimmy Page------(and people will listen to him because of Led Zeppelin)---------and Eric Clapton.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	The Kinks|`|BBn8Xkiyaa	The Kinks 100%    P.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	The yardbirds were not that great the only reason they are better is because they had three guitarists that are now in the top 10 greatist guitarists.|`|hZegT1raaa	the kinks|`|AA11017714	Um...  WHAT???|`|5Wa8pNn9aa	The Kinks I guess?|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	The kinks rock.  "Do it again" is my favorite.  Standing in the middle of nowhere,  Wondering how to begin.  Lost between tomorrow and yesterday,  Between now and then.    And now we're back where we started,  Here we go round again.  Day after day I get up and I say  I better do it again.    Where are all the people going?  Round and round till we reach the end.  One day leading to another,  Get up, go out, do it again.    Then it's back where you started,  Here we go round again.  Back where you started,  Come on do it again.    And you think today is going to be better,  Change the world and do it again.  Give it all up and start all over,  You say you will but you don't know when.    Then it's back where you started,  Here we go round again.  Day after day I get up and I say  Come on do it again.    The days go by and you wish you were a different guy,  Different friends and a new set of clothes.  You make alterations and affect a new pose,  A new house, a new car, a new job, a new nose.  But it's superficial and it's only skin deep,  Because the voices in your head keep shouting in your sleep.  Get back, get back.    Back where you started, here we go round again,  Back where you started, come on do it again.    Back where you started, here we go round again,  Day after day I get up and I say, do it again.  Do it again.  Day after day I get up and I say, come on do it again.

aXbSpXhCaa	10 Question: If a blonde and a brunette fell off a building, who would hit the ground first?  Answer: The brunette - the blonde would have to stop for directions!    9 The assistant asked the blonde if she would like her pizza cut into six pieces or twelve.        "Six please" she said, "I could never eat twelve!"    8 A blonde was walking down the road with a healthy looking pig under her arm. As she passed the bus stop, someone asked,        "Where did you get that?"    The pig replied,        "I won her in a raffle!"    7 A person went into the office kitchen one morning and found a new blonde girl painting the walls. She was wearing a new fur coat and a nice denim jacket.    Thinking this was a little strange, he asked her why she was wearing them rather than old clothes or an overall.    She showed him the instructions on the tin,        "For best results, put on two coats".    6 Two blondes were in a parking lot trying to unlock the door of their car with a coat hanger.  First Blonde:        "I can't seem to get this door unlocked!    Second Blonde:        Well you better hurry up. It's starting to rain and the top is down!    5 Three blondes were walking through a field when they came across a set of tracks.    The first blonde looked down at the tracks and said,        "I think they could be bird tracks."    The second blonde went to look and said,        "No, I think these are deer tracks."    They stepped aside and the third blonde went over to the tracks. She looked down, then got run over by the train!    4 A blonde asked someone what time it was, and they told her it was 4:45. The blonde, with a puzzled look on her face replied,        "You know, it's the weirdest thing, I have been asking that question all day, and each time I get a different answer."    3 A blonde was driving down the road listening to the radio and was quite upset when she heard blonde joke after blonde joke. A little way down the road, she saw another blonde out in a field rowing a boat. The blonde stopped her car and angrily jumped out yelling,        "You dumb blonde bimbo! It's blondes like you that give the rest of us a bad name! If I could swim I'd come out there and give you what's coming to you!"    2 A blonde and a redhead went to the bar after work for a drink, and sat on stools watching the 6 O'clock news. A man was shown threatening to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge, and the blonde bet the redhead $50 that he wouldn't jump.    Sure enough, he jumped, so the blonde gave the redhead $50. The redhead said,        "I can't take this, you're my friend."    But the blonde insisted saying,        "No. A bet's a bet."    Then the redhead said        "Listen, I have to tell you that I saw this on the 5 O'clock news, so I can't take your money."    The blonde replied        "Well, so did I, but I didn't think he would jump again!"    1 A dumb blonde was really tired of being made fun of, so she decided to have her hair she would look like a brunette.    When she had brown hair, she decided to take a drive in the country.    After she had been driving for a while, she saw a farmer and a flock of sheep and thought,        "Oh! Those sheep are so adorable!"    She got out and walked over to the farmer and said,        "If I can guess how many sheep you have, can I take one home?"    The farmer, being a bit of a gambler himself, said she could have a try.    The blonde looked at the flock and guessed, "157."    The farmer was amazed - she was right! So the blonde, (who looked like a brunette), picked one out and got back into her car.    Before she left, farmer walked up to her and said.        "If I can guess the real color of your hair, can I have my dog back?"    A woman went into hospital to have a fanny tuck. After the operation she received 3 cards while she was recovering. One was a get well card from her husband, one a card from the surgeon and a 3rd, which was a thank you card, from Eric, on the burns unit thanking her for his new ears.    When I went to lunch today, I noticed an old lady sitting on a park   bench sobbing her eyes out. I stopped and asked her what was wrong. She  said, "I have a 22 year old husband at home. He makes love to me every  morning and then gets up and makes me pancakes, sausage, fresh fruit and freshy ground coffee."  I said, "Well, then why are you crying?"  She went on, "He makes me homemade soup for lunch and my favourite biscuits and then makes love to me for half the afternoon."  I said again, "Well, why are you crying?"  She continued again, "For dinner he makes me a  gourmet meal with wine and my favourite dessert and then makes love to me until 2:00 a.m. "  I said, "Well, why in the world would you be crying?"  She said, "I can't remember where I live.    Things you can get away with saying only at Christmas.         1: I prefer breasts to legs    2. Tying the legs together keeps the inside moist.    3. Smother the butter all over the breasts!    4. If I don't undo my trousers, I'll|`|7gfNIajYaa	Once upon a time there was a man named Paul Murphy.  Him and his friend Bob O Shea met up one day by accident on the street. They hadnt seen each other since highschool/    "Oh my God...Bob is that you!!!??"says Paul.  No waaaay,Paaauuuul!!"shouts Bob.    The two spend ages talking about the past and eventually they start talking about the present.    "So Paul,what are you doing now?"asks Bob.  "Well,I own a nail factory"replies Paul. "Its called Murphys nails,how about you Bob?"    "I work in the media making commercials for companys,boring and easy stuff really. I make plenty of money. Do you?"    "No my nail factory doesnt get enough marketing...it kinda sucks"    "I have an idea. Listen,you know I owe you for hooking me up with that chick back in highschool...how about I make an add for your factory!!!Then youl start gaining money for sure!"says Bob!    Paul is delighted and agrees. Bob tells Paul that an add for his nail factory will be made in a few days and that he will ring Paul when it will come on the tv.    One night as Paul is sitting down watching tv his phone rings and an estatic Bob tells Paul that any moment the add will come on the tv,.    Paul sits there untill eventually an add comes on the tv.    The add is simply a picture of Jesus nailed to the cross with the slogan "Murphys nails are miraculas" typed across the screen.    The whole world erupts in anger after seeing the add.   The Vatican in Rome is full of anger and chaos. Every religion is laughing or angry. Sheer chaos and wars eventually reign across the Earth itself.    Paul rings Bob.    "Bob what have you done!!The world wants my head!!Fix this!!"cries Paul to Bob.  "Okay wait a few days and Il have it fixed"    Paul is sitting down watching tv nervously a few nights later.    An add comes on the tv.    In the add,there is simply a cross with nobody on it. The thunderous sound of a stampede can be heard. Suddenly an image of Jesus running away from an army of Roman soldiers is shown. Jesus turns to the camera with his thumb up and says "The should have used Murphys nails!!!!!"|`|G26O8ecfaa	The newly weds ..........      The newly weds arrived at the front desk of the posh ocean-side resort in Hilton Head, South Carolina, looking all fresh, and eager to enjoy their two week vacation / honeymoon.  The stunning blonde at the front desk smiled and said, "Well, hi Jimmy baby, how ya been lover ? Long time no see."  A frosty silence prevailed until the couple reached their room.

Startled he looks around the room but there doesnt seem to be anyone there, so he carries on stashing the valuables into his bag.  Then he hears the voice again: Jesus is watching you.    He looks around the room again, only this time more thoroughly, and he spies a parrot in a cage.    He walks over to the cage and says: My, my, a talking parrot. Are you Jesus then?

I guess I'd better see a doctor."     "Listen, you don't have to spend that kind of money," Mike replies.    "There's a diagnostic computer down at Wal-Mart. Just give it a urine sample and the computer will tell you what's wrong and what to do about it.     It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars . . A lot cheaper than a doctor."    So, Joe deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to Wal-Mart.    He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits.     Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout:    "You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks. Thank you for shopping @ Wal-Mart."    That ! evening, while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Joe began wondering if the computer could be fooled.    He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and a sperm sample for good measure.     Joe hurries back to Wal-Mart, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results.    The computer prints the following:    1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. (Aisle 9)   2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. (Aisle 7)  3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab.  4. Your wife is pregnant. Twins. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.  5 If you don't stop playing with yourself, your elbow will never get better!

She was stark naked! As I was reeling from the shock I heard my 5-year-old shout from the back seat, 'Mom, that lady isn't wearing a seat belt!'     2) OPINIONS   On the first day of school, a first-grader handed his teacher a note from his mother. The note read, 'The opinions expressed by this child are not necessarily those of his parents.'     3) KETCHUP   A woman was trying hard to get the ketchup out of the jar. During her struggle the phone rang so she asked her 4-year-old daughter to answer the phone. 'Mommy can't come to the phone to talk to you right now. She's hitting the bottle.'     4) MORE NUDITY   A little boy got lost at the YMCA and found himself in the women's locker room. When he was spotted, the room burst into shrieks, with ladies grabbing towels and running for cover. The little boy watched in amazement and then asked, 'What's the matter, haven't you ever seen a little boy before?'     5) POLICE   1   While taking a routine vandalism report at an elementary school, I was interrupted by a little girl about 6 years old. Looking up and down at my uniform, she asked, 'Are you a cop?   Yes,' I answered and continued writing the report. My mother said if I ever needed help I should ask the police. Is that right?' 'Yes, that's right,' I told her. 'Well, then,' she said as she extended her foot toward me, 'would you please tie my shoe?'       6) POLICE   2 It was the end of the day when I parked my police van in front of the station. As I gathered my equipment, my K-9 partner, Jake, was barking, and I saw a little boy staring in at me. 'Is that a dog you got back there?' he asked. 'It sure is,' I replied. Puzzled, the boy looked at me and then towards the back of the   van. Finally he said, 'What'd he do?'       7) ELDERLY While working for an organization that delivers lunches to elderly shut-ins, I used to take my 4-year-old daughter on my afternoon rounds. She was unfailingly intrigued by t he various appliances of old age, particularly the canes, walkers and wheelchairs. One day I found her staring at a pair of false teeth soaking in a glass. As I braced myself for the inevitable barrage of questions, she merely turned and whispered, 'The tooth fairy will never believe this!'     8) DRESS-UP A little girl was watching her parents dress for a party. When she saw her dad donning his tuxedo, she warned, 'Daddy, you shouldn't wear that suit.' 'And why not, darling?' 'You know that it always gives you a headache the next morning.'       10) SCHOOL A little girl had just finished her first week of school. 'I'm just wasting my time,' she said to her mother. 'I can't read, I can't write, and they won't let me talk!'     11) BIBLE A little boy opened the big family Bible. He was fascinated as he fingered through the old pages. Suddenly, something fell out of the Bible.   He picked up the object and looked at it. What he saw was an old leaf that had been pressed in between the pages. 'Mama, look what I found,' the boy called out. 'What have you got there, dear?' With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered, 'I think it's Adam's underwear!'|`|8phMfVERaa	Work, you say?

lbvF3GZsaa	oh my god.......have any of you people actually even heard the song C.R.E.A.M.? Obviously not.     Lame answers, people...Here's the only answer you need:    A 'Shorty', although it is now used to describe a young women, originally meant a young guy that was new to the game, you know, particularly the drug game but also the rap game or whatever. And the song C.R.E.A.M. is about how hard it is to make it in the ghetto in NYC, particularly the things young guys have to do to make it, like sell drugs.       So...when it says, "life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff", he's talking about going to jail,  (the line before that is 'hancuffed in the back of a bus, 40 of us).....and more broadly he's talking about how life in general shouldn't be so hard for a kid from the ghetto.    Just wanted to clear this up for ya, guy.....lots of ignorant answers you're getting and all that.|`|f6f5c3479ccfabd9b01b2d8b87e5ec81aa	Short and sweet. It means life as a kid shouldn't be so hard.

q4XUy0Duaa	I agree with you.  It's been proven that alcohol causes a person to lose more brain cells than weed does, and to act more recklessly under the influence of alcohol as well, but for some reason, alcohol is legal.  And of course there are the many medicinal purposes for smoking weed such as the treatment of asthma, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, cancer, aids, depression, stress, arthritis, etc.  It's a natural plant that grows just like oregano and basil, and there's no reason it should be illegal.  But like Big W said, the government is already making too much money off of it by supplying the suppliers.  On top of that, they know everyone smokes regardless, and it's an easy way to keep the prison cells filled.  I've been caught numerous times where the DTs are parked near the spot just waiting for people to go in.  If they were trying to eliminate the so called problem, they would raid the spot instead of arresting each person who enters the spot, but the cops have quotas to meet.  I've had cops compliment the quality of my weed and confiscate it and I highly doubt it ever ends up in any evidence rooms.  And I'm not sure what the laws are in the rest of the country, but in NYC, the law continues to change so that the severity of the punishment increases.  Before Giuliani took office, being charged with possession was a slap on the wrist.  Nowadays, if you're caught with at least an ounce, you're tried with the intent to sell, and an ounce really isn't much and is obviously for personal use.  There was even one law that was implemented that made it possible to take away someone's financial aid if they're caught with possession.  I wish the government would realize how much money they would make off of taxes alone if it was legalized.  We would also save a lot of money because it costs the tax payers over $35,000/year to pay for the occupancy of one prison cell, and you'd be surprised at how many people are locked up for possession.|`|xUxUwloPaa	Biting Katt Williams is SO 2004.|`|ceF5X2m7aa	thats what im saying!  i think the reason they use is because if you legalize weed then people are gonna start fighting to legalize cocaine and stuff..|`|nDQOwAA3aa	because back in the day their was a young man trying to make a name for himself (i refuse to learn his name because if i do then he won) and he payed scientist to make false reports on pot and wouldn't publish any findings that says anything other than pot is worse than heroin with is an actually quote and they were either going to legalize alcohol or weed and you can't use alcohol for anything other than drinking while you can make all kinds of things with weed with would ruin many corporations|`|nlRUP7UAaa	its illlegal 2 but it without a consent 4rom a doctor  but it ain illegal 2 use|`|Lq9tBgdaaa	why are weapons restricted? They are only chunks of metal that just so happens to kill people if you touch them wrong.|`|oba1NFNdaa	they make it illegal because they say it make you loose brain cells, but i think there all full of ****. your right all it is, is a plant.|`|kgUzdfqVaa	It is just a plant - and it is natural.  However - half the stuff people smoke these days has been grown using horrible disgusting chemicals which make the smokers in to very wierd, paranoid, anti-social people over time.  Also, a minority of people don't know hot to handle themselves and smoke too much which again affects their mental health.  So - yes - it would be great if it were legalised and made safer. BUT there will always be a minority of 'tards that will ruin it for everyone else.|`|LS2mF8u3aa	Well, first off; Racist history.    And it hasn't been legalized because unintelligent, bureaucratic politicians don't know how to legalize, control, and economically use the legalization of marijuana to their benefit.     In time, dear friend, our dreams will come true.|`|m2UUrurBaa	Because like every other illegal substance, The fed's are making too much bread off it,    Although in Cali they do have the weed vending machines.|`|P3GgROxtaa	i agree with you 100% i think its bogus  that its illegal. i do it anyways but still  i think thats stupid. i dont understand   why either. but just cause its illegal  doesnt mean its guna stop me from doin  it haha|`|ZN5nkM0waa	I've many sources say that it's illegal because the government can't tax it. that seem like the only logical reason. It has no permanant effects, it's not addictive and it hasn't killed anyone. In the end it all comes down to money.|`|S7tmJEkGaa	Because politicians are crooks and they make more money off tobacco, which is proven to be more lethal. There has been some studies that can prove some shortterm memory loss, but thats it!|`|wqP48i43aa	its not illegal if you dont get caught|`|4xgPgvKfaa	Yes it illegal. The only part its legal is when you live in a certain state and you use it for medical purpose. But the goverment must give you an all clear.|`|ID8w4y1Waa	Many people I know don't realise it's illegal lol|`|6fxr3VBGaa	but just think if it was legal than how the dope boys gone to make any money.    i think it should stay illegal to sale because it would cause problems if it became legal to sale    but i do think that the drug charges for possession of marijuana should be lowered or even did away with completely. i don't want the jails filled with people who were just trying to smoke a blunt.

Surprises and just leave me on the edge of my seat action.  Love fantasy and sci fi movies because they take me to another world.  I love those kinds of movies, I love psychological thrillers, such as silence of the lambs, hannibal, oldboy, bug, etc...|`|a48cfffc5a668f8ee11c890acdaf3ccfaa	The Soundtrack.  If it is good, it doesn't matter who the actors are, what the plot is...the music can make the scene.    This is why I can't watch Asian movies.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	A good movie for me is one that makes me forget I am watching a movie.  I want to feel the experience is real.|`|AA12116276	A movie that is not like most other stuff out in terms of basics. A lot of people say romance. But if you think about it, it doesn't matter what genre the movie is in, there almost always turns out to be some cheesy love story that ends the same way. Please, a movie that differs from the same kind of formula and script as always--just something that I can't watch and know exactly what path it's going down the whole entire time. A love story can be fine, but not done the same as always.|`|9HtT0RiGaa	The plot and the acting skill of the actors / actresses.|`|JX5sm9Mzaa	comedy but also pathos, and always romance  happy endings are nice but not required - it makes them cheesy  in horrors - no happy endings = ]  x|`|GEuXbpCMaa	booobz!!|`|wEbB1FuNaa	i look for romance and how the guy treats the girl...if you end up watching a movie and you dont like it encourage your friends to go see it!!|`|wvPwc4PGaa	I just look for something that interests me, usually crime thrillers....i try not to get bogged down with clever cinematics or anything like that, i just prefer good plain story telling....|`|6BCYXUbDaa	I love quarky characters, who you eventually see there deeper feelings. Like in Garden State. I like dark and off humor.  Thrillers aren't so much my thing, but if i can't call the plot in the first 10 minutes it sounds good.|`|1uRUaSblaa	I like movies that keep me wide awake and intrigued throughout, with interesting story plots.Usually, I go for comedies. I like a good laugh. Horror films are a 'no-no' for me.Extreme psychological thriller sounds exciting but not for the faint-hearted like me,I guess.:)|`|il9Tdmchaa	I want the movie to really get me involved so I can escape for a couple of hours. I like comedies the best but a really good one is hard to find. I also like a movie to be fast paced and characters that seem like you could run into them anytime.|`|hGY08GjRaa	The movies I get most excited about and want to share with the world are ones that move me or really make me think. If a movie makes me cry... It's guaranteed to be a new favorite, because I don't cry easily at movies/TV...only if something is really powerful and touching.    Any "message" the  movie has, also  has to agree with my own sense of morals.     But I also enjoy less "deep" movies that just have an interesting story/plot.  I like a good comedy now and then, or a good family movie.     But basically, my top list of movies are ones that display the strength of the human spirit, make me feel a glimmer of hope about humanity.. and make me really put myself in the character's shoes.    Extreme psychological thrillers can be fun if A) there's not too much gore (I like a good murder mystery, but they don't need to focus on the gore of it) and B) I prefer not to  hear the F word every 20 seconds, TYVM.

1494f9fee36fe30f5be23fa070a2529daa	It is neither "Season 3 part 1" nor "Season 4 part 1." It's more like "Season 3, Part 2." It is still a part of season three, but it's a new "volume."     "Volume Four: Fugitives" has a promising beginning, though anything looks good in comparison to the train wreck that was the "Villains" volume. Heroes has been on a decline quality-wise and I am hoping that this fourth volume will restore my faith in the show.|`|6hFK44Bnaa	I thought that episode was one of the best episodes of the entire series.|`|sZHcfnq9aa	i agree! I absolutely love heroes! It is one of my favorite shows ever! I have already finished season 3, not too long ago. Enjoy it! =]
Ui8DcdmMaa	People use both.  Tropical is more 'Western' but Sidereal is more kind of 'Vedic' or Hindu or Indian.  An interesting experiment was done where astrologers were given the same situation to analyse using different kinds of astrology, including Sidereial and Tropical and interestingly they all came to the same conclusion.     No-one can explain why this might be.  I think you have to go with your style and trust that it will offer something to you.  There is no right and wrong - only different.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I agree with the person above me.     Tropical astrology is more true for me. Sidereal is mostly not very true for me, but it got a few things right. However, what it said that was correct is something that my Tropical already told me.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	Tropical is based on Babylonian Astrology and is two signs off. Sidereal is based on Indian Astrology and is 1 and 2 third signs off.  Both are accurate but the descriptions for each sign is a bit different. I use tropical because that is what I started with and it works. However it doesn't work the way most astrologers think it works. The symbolism is wrong for the most part and that is what is causing all the confusion. For example Traditional Astrology says that Juno points to marriage and is a good sign of the soul mate. This is simply not true. Juno points to the love affair and mistresses; love without marriage. And if it does end in marriage, there are no children. Another example: Neptune is the third Benefic but Traditional Astrology says that it's the planet of illusions. This is only true when badly aspected because Neptune rules creatvity among other things. Getting the symbolism right is very important. It has to work every time and in the Astrology I practice it does.|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	Same reason people use Indian, Chinese, or some other type. No one bothers to really take the time to examine which, if any, are truly accurate.  Magic 8 Ball works for me. It's not bigoted. It's fast. it's cheap. And like astrology, works no better than random chance.    If it's not science, it's superstition.|`|QfTEYT3zaa	All of these ancient systems are a matter of feeling. The didn't just spring from nothing, they're a blend of everything, so its ok just to go with whichever one feels more right.     I suggest you do a lot more of your own research, and maybe talk to people who use one or the other about how accurate it is to their lives and why.
21J0IIZbaa	Overall the lineup is better than last year.  I like Disturbed and Slipknot better than any of the bands on this year tour.      Manson and Slayer together is great enough, but adding all the other bands puts the lineup a 10+    I saw Killswitch Engage in 2005 and Behemoth in 2007.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I think it sounds pretty good ;D|`|5G4cRjA5aa	Very well put together, I have to say.    Mikhaela|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	I'd like to see Slayer and Marilyn Manson.  The rest are gaywads though.|`|8oDAhb7Waa	me and a friend wanted to go to see cannibal corpse and slayer but we didn't know all those **** bands were playing also. we'd be stuck sitting through all them gay bands with nothing but trendy myspace scene kids spinning around in one spot not making contact with anyone doing chuck norris roundhouse kicks fighting an intense battle with the invisible force known only as AIR (hardcore "dancing" LOL). and they're not even playing on the same stage which is lame. i'll pass.|`|4m1U5Z7naa	I think Mayhem should play at Mayhem Festival   and I don't think that's the "sickest lineup ever"|`|qkCFLgaSaa	oh its just sick how cool this concert is gona be! ive already seen slayer and MARILYN MANSON and omg it flippin awsome! i cant wait see ya front row!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

10mOHSZTaa	A piano is a keyboard instrument. If you have hopes of performing on an acoustic piano, you should get a keyboard with at least one pedal and weighted keys, or you're going to be in for a big shock when you have to play an actual instrument.    I have no idea what you mean by practical or theory, though. Theory *is* practical; without theory, you can't improvise. People who 'just make something up' are people with a solid grounding in theory, whether they picked it up the efficient, boring way and got training, or the inefficient, romantic way and reinvented the wheel figuring it out for themselves.|`|aFGnE9BHaa	the keyboard is much easier to play because the touch is different and easier to play and control.    I have been playing the piano for 10 years and theory can get really boring, but it really helps when you play the piano.|`|Ixny0YFIaa	same ****|`|etA9BX5gaa	its the same..  why not learn on a keyboard.  they are cheaper, and easier to move.    just in case you find yourself hating it...you won't be stuck with a piano.|`|CSD1JsOTaa	Piano...and Practical...theory sucks|`|zlQo7WMoaa	They're the same it doesn't really make any difference. Practical, I'm not too good at reading music.|`|ezxrCnZ6aa	ok the piano and the keyborad are almost the same its a little easyer if u first learn on the piano and the move 2 the keyborad i know this for a life experience i have played the piano for 3 years and the key board is so easy for me because i learned on the piano first.|`|L3ZD8p7paa	keyboard is playing chords such as the C chord with the left hand and playing the tune with the right  piano is playing the melody  it depends, for example: if you area beginner you might want to try playing something simple such as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star then try the original Twinkle Twinkle little star song composed by Mozart.   By my opinion i am now learning piano but i once learned keyboard and i believe keyboard is easier for me!
I6vMxEU9aa	So take one word, you said  You put it in your bed  You rest your tiny head on your pillow    You wonder where you're going next  You've got your hair pushed to my chest  And now you're hoping  That someone will let you in    Well, I swear I'll let you in  You know I'll let you in  Oh Kelsey, you    So don't let anyone scare you  You know that I'll protect you  Always, now through the thick and thin  Until the end    You better watch it  You know you don't cross it  Because, I'm always here for you  And I'll be here for you    I know, I know, I know  I know how it feels  Believe me, I've been there  And I know, I know, I know  I know what it feels like  Tell me, Kelsey    And I'll swim the ocean for you  The ocean for you  Whoa, Kelsey  And I'll swim the ocean for you  The ocean for you  Whoa, Kelsey  Oh you, darling    Now it's gonna get harder  And it's gonna burn brighter  And it's gonna feel tougher  Each and every day    So let me say, that I love you  You're all I've ever wanted  All I've ever dreamed of to come  And yes you did come    I want you so bad, can you feel it too?  You know I'm so, I'm so in love with you  I want you, so much  I need you, so much  I need your, I need your, your touch    And I'll swim the ocean for you  The ocean for you  Whoa, Kelsey  And I'll swim the ocean for you  The ocean for you  Whoa, Kelsey    And I'll swim the ocean for you  The ocean for you  Whoa, Kelsey  And I'll swim the ocean for you  The ocean for you  Whoa, Kelsey    And you never, ever let me in   (Let me in)  And you never, ever let me in  (Let me in)  And you never, ever let me in  (Let me in)  And you never, ever let me in|`|kYUmWAOiaa	I don't know.
dpYMlxA4aa	The vast majority of Movie and video game music is all done electronically with Synths. until you break into block buster hollywood stuff you need a firm grasp of audio software and hardware. But even when your music is being "performed" by synths you still need a solid composition background to make something musically satisfying (that background isn't necassarily taught in school.    I wouldn't drop out and go to trade school, though if your school doesn't offer courses in electronic music you may want to transfer to a school that does offer that.|`|MBiAm9zaaa	It depends on what college you are in. Does it have a strong music program? If not, you may want to consider switching to a different college, or going to a trade school.|`|Ea9A4yHNaa	Yeah, you'll have to take that stuff. I should know... I AM a composing major! I'm in my last semester and I can tell you taking two foreign language courses was, I thought, a bit ridiculous.    Now, I have been composing since I was about 6 or 7... nothing serious, just short melodies. My stuff got better when I got older, but it really took off once I had music theory!  Hopefully you'll get other classes too, like form, orchestration, and counterpoint. Music history might sound boring, but if it's taught right, this class can be VERY useful. Knowing some history might give you some new ideas.    Now, I want to be a film composer, so I understand your concern. You should learn to be a better composer through the program you're currently in, but I don't know if you'll have the right degree for your career choice. I know that if I really wanted to make it as a film composer, I'd probably would have to major in film composition in some school in California [I'm not ready to move to the West Coast]. There may be a degree in composition with emphasis in alternative media... I don't know. You might want to scrounge around in video game trade magazines and online articles. Read articles about some of your favorite video game composers. What education do they have? What schools did they attend? If you can find this out, you can see what classes they might have taken and see how close your current degree lines up with it. Many times two classes might be packaged a little differently but they will essentially be the same class.    Asking the college's counselor can be dubious, since most times they don't know what classes you'll definitely need for your career choice; they're mostly just trying to reel in students. They might say, "O yeah, you'll need this, this will be a great way to set up that career" but unless they know of someone that has done so from your school, or know FOR SURE that it's possible, they're most likely blowing smoke.    Good luck and I hope you can find out what you're looking for.|`|zg0Iricdaa	I mean I am no expert, but unless your a gifted person at a prestigious music school it's going to be tough road to getting recognized and getting your stuff in movies, especially big time blockbusters.  I think, unless it is your real passion to compose for an orchestra, you should get involved in audio engineering.    But I could be wrong.

(Yuck)|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	Yes, my youngest sister & my daughter & only a few years apart & we were all arguing about something involving men, money, lifestyle & I guess everyone was talking crap, I accidentally sent an email to the wrong person & then we were all fighting & had to get together in person to resolve it.    It's happened to me with text messages to... I would be texting & then I would receive a text msg & just hit reply & then after I sent it, I was like, who did I just reply to? I need to learn to pay more attention... It's a horrible feeling to know you just wrote a message venting your frustrations & then you realize you sent it to the wrong person...|`|AA11530601	i think i have regretted it yeah but usually about a day afterwards. Have never got an email not meant for me!|`|1bkiNiwzaa	No, I'm not impulsive, so fortunately that hasnt happened.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Yeah, once at work I sent an e-mail to one of my co-workers, but I hit reply all accidentally - I sent a message to a client about how much of a waste of my time the project was. Yeah, that sucked. But I didn't get fired.|`|MBknatYtaa	I'm sure everyone has, that's why google's gmail actually has an optional setting to help prevent drunk e-mailing by having a setting where you have to answer a math problem before you send it. I haven't set up my account to use it as yet, but it is an interesting feature. Do you think Yahoo will get upset with me for plugging a competitors product?|`|GzlckRcnaa	oh yes,even now i'm still regretting it but i'm not gonna tell you.sorry it is a secret :P|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Yes a long time ago. I learned my lesson and no longer communicate emotional things over email; those things are usually better to be addressed in person.|`|ipqWxJyGaa	No, I haven`t.|`|rMmVuHEhaa	Nope|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...unfortunately a few...|`|sVFkMVujaa	yes, to both.  once sent a pic to my little sister that was meant for a friend in australia.  i heard about it for a month, lol.   and i always receive emails for people with erectile disfunction and those who have money to throw away on scams.|`|iVC63zypaa	Several .. I don't even want to think of some them. *cringes*|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	not yet  : )|`|RAiBtbMLaa	ehh. yehh!! who hasn't? :/|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	i have it was my ex boyfriend i wrote him a mean email about how i was over him and that he was too stupid to let me go now he getting what he deserve i didn't think it would sound so mean until i read after it was sent|`|GEuXbpCMaa	yes|`|s9I6QwV7aa	ye. It was a junk mail|`|aTzcqC4Naa	yeah... regretted sending a few... texts more so though|`|Yn185AiOaa	kinda it was a text message confessing my love for someone ;D  wow now that i think about it, that message was reallt corny|`|KSIkMTknaa	YES, last week it was my job resignation! Given another day I would not have proceeded.|`|9mbpXIlvaa	I store my emails as a draft first for a while, then go back and read it for that reason...that's much easier than trying to apologize later. :)    I started doing this after I accidentally sent my very religious aunt an off-color joke meant for my husband. Their names are stored right next to each other in the address book---VERY embarrassing.|`|7cdfc5d9a205827b098980cae58531dbaa	Yes a lot. after many times of doing this and being regretful after that, I got used to just thinking once more about the email before pushing  the send button or taking one more look at the names of my recipients if I am sending it to many people.|`|hf6UbyUxaa	Yes I have sent an email to somebody and I immediately regretted it...  Because once I meet someone online and he was nice to me when I am sad that is why I tell him about why I am sad but a few days later I heard a rumor that he is laughing about what happened to me and he tell it to other pepopel and he did not keep his promise that he will not tell anybody about that secret why I am sad...

ndbxnUfwaa	A site called SeatBOT has them right now.  These guys seem to always have the tuff stuff to find.|`|g3hfy9Ziaa	You might not be able to find tickets for less due to the fact that the London venues can hold more people and therefore can charge less for tickets.|`|TYLwhc4Baa	True, I saw the tickets on ticketloot for $ 132 and there were only 2 available. so that means they are quite sought after. i would suggest buying them if you can, or take an easyjet flight to london.. will probably cost a bit more :))

Also met Chris Eccleston, Johnny Vegas and the guy who used to play Andy McDonald in Corrie when they came in to pick up tickets.    I also met Chris Moyles, Tim Booth, Natalie Appleton and Johnny Lee Miller backstage at a Radio 1 gig in Heaton Park years ago.    Gary, Phil and Tracey Neville grew up living next door to my Gran so used to speak to them quite a lot.     My mum asked David & Victoria Beckham for their autograph in Selfridges in the Trafford Centre and I met Jordan when she was doing a book signing in Borders. Also met Steps at the BBC in Manc.    Wow, I've met quite a few famous people when I look back!    :o)|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Back in the 80's I met Billy Wright the footballer, he used to play for Wolverhampton Wanderers.

He is as vain as he appears, but can also laugh at himself, so fair enough really.  He was great with the kids and just one of us at the end of the day.    I have sttod close to Princess Anne and Ewan McGregor at the Blair Athol Horse Trials on different years; and I once saw Pat Sharp in McDonald's in London, he was strutting about like "look at me everyone", we just rolled our eyes and went on our way, although that was a few decades ago now.

OSK0tQPSaa	Potentially so, as many movie goers are rather thick|`|tuvcxnJXaa	I think the name 'Twilight' will almost certainly be in the title, simply for marketing's sake.    Not everyone will know the name 'New Moon', but they'll instantly associate with the Twilight series if the name is in the title.|`|QEEweJUaaa	Twilight will be the title more than likely.
RKbmRAR8aa	1. She doesn't think that the Phantom will actually hurt Christine. He really just wants to help her and love her at the beginning, it's only after she picks Raoul over him that the Phantom starts getting angry.   2. She doesn't know what he is going to do before he does it. She of course saved him while they were both young, so she knows him and knows that he is the Opera Ghost, but he doesn't confide in her.  3. Does she? I didn't remember that.    4. She is not at the auction with Raoul, they are at the same event for obvious reasons, because for both of them much of their past is attached to it. They bid against each other on the same object.  5. Raoul sits in Box 5 during the performance of Il Muto, because he is denying the existence of the Phantom at that point.
96zZlJVYaa	Good question. Madam Gery when up there to check on Raoul because the Phantom had warn them about leaving box 5 empty. This is his own personal box to watch the stage without anyone would notice him sitting there.     The reason why they thought the Phantom had left because there wasn't any more incident during rehearsal or on stage. They sung Masquerade to celebrate his absent because no one knew who the Phantom was and they had a very too year as well.    you have good taste...

a1Ngi39Xaa	Wow, I learn so much here in Yahoo Answers!!  I am not Canadian so I didn't know all that....|`|q1zz80wBaa	It was when the European travelled Canadian shores. Europeans were looking for spices but they found the beaver instead. So they started demanding beaver pelts for expensive top hats. Top hats were so popular back in the day, so the Hudson's Bay Company had a flag/symbol of moose and beaver on it. Thats when the coin came out too.|`|8phMfVERaa	And I thought Wallty and the Beav were American icons!   See how much I know, huh?    lol, JK    PEACE
lbvF3GZsaa	You know.....it's probably not especially 'cause you're a women.....it's probably 'cause you're 26 with no music credentials.     Honestly....the music industry is a male-dominated, sexist field. It's going to be tough no matter what. And furthermore, what have you done in the music industry? This seems less a question about men thinking you're a bimbo and more a question about how to break into the music industry. That industry does not want vision statements........they want production. They want to see what you've done with other musicians.     So my advice to you would be to start cutting your teeth with a band, or multiple bands.......be the person in your music community that everyone wants to work with, or everyone has. You need exposure as an artist before you can break into the industry. You need to 'brand' yourself, you know, make yourself more marketable.     And check out this video link I've posted below. It's Scott Austin, one of the younger music execs, talking about how to break into the industry. Cheers and good luck.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	Its the genre your trying for   switched to something more respectable|`|21428fc02666515c85c83d64ffb798faaa	Maybe you should "pretend" your a bimbo...then you might get what you want...Engage in a little sexual innuendo...dress a little more provacative...Its a sad statement...but its true...I bet things change...Maybe just try it as a form of research...Its a dirty industry...|`|6631c5068e2c4c313b1caa78900e6761aa	Don' t hate the players hate the game..Its unfortunate but that's how the music industry is.

By:Kathy Mattea  Lyrics:Claire had all but given up  When she and Edwin fell in love  She touched his face and shook her head  In disbelief she sighed and said  In many dreams I've held you near  Now at last you're really here    Chorus  Where have you been?  I've looked for you for ever and a day  Where have you been?  I'm just not myself when you're away    He asked her for her hand for life  Then she became a salesman's wife  He was home each night by 8  But one stormy evening he was late  Her frightened tears fell to the floor  Until his key turned in the door    Chorus  Where have you been?  I've looked for you for ever and a day  Where have you been?  I'm just not myself when you're away    They'd never spent a night apart  For 60 yrs she heard him snore  Now they're in a hospital  In seperate beds on different floors    Claire soon lost her memory, forgot the names of family  She never spoke a word again  Then one day they wheeled him in  He held her hand and stroked her hair  In a fragile voice she said    Chorus  Where have you been?  I've looked for you for ever and a day  Where have you been?  I'm just not myself when you're away    Where have you been  Ive searched for you forever and a day  Where have you been  Im just not myself when your away  Im just not myself when your away     Video link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc1COAJug...

It's out of one of his songs from his side-band - Fort Minor.  I'll try and find out more infomation for you -    EDIT - Here we go -   "Although 22 songs in total were played at the concert, "Somewhere I Belong", "Papercut", "Points of Authority" (which featured verses from the Fort Minor songs "Petrified" and "There They Go") and "Wake 2.0" were cut from the CD tracklist."Somewhere I Belong", "Papercut", and "Points of Authority" are featured and appear on the DVD as Hidden Content while "Wake 2.0", appears only on the DVD listing."  Thats from wikipedia by the way - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_to_Rev...      This is from lyricsmode.com. It's a bit of the song lyrics from Petrified  Yeah  How you doin', y'all?

9ZZ9VSUoaa	I wouldn't actually call it a sex scene. They were just kissing, and Edward never intended to do more than that.     Edward has to be extra careful around Bella. Even though he loves her, he also wants to kill her. Her scent is stronger to him then anybody elses. If he loses control of himself, he may not be able to stop himself from doing something he doesn't want.    Besides the fact that Edward is old fashioned and believes in being married first. Just wait until Breaking Dawn! Now that will be a sex scene!|`|zV70m8eJaa	it wasn't a sex scene - it was their first kiss.    and he pulled away because the smell of her blood  became too much for him and he thought about killing her.|`|SCknCanPaa	Because if he got too out of control he'd bite her.  Breaking Dawn was hilarious.    Didn't you read the books first? U:|`|5486688cf347dd651f288eb7332d092daa	lol, that was not a sex scene.

The film was way too dark (literally), which made it extremely difficult to see what was going on. Why in the world would the director choose a small mountain town as the setting for the film?

I'm so into you  And the hardest part is knowing that I'll never follow through  You're slowly killing me  And I wish it wasn't true  Cause I'm so into you    Like a ton of bricks it hit me  And woke me from this dream  No matter how hard I tried to wash my hands  I could never get 'em clean  I could never get 'em clean    What are you doing to me?  I'm so into you  And the hardest part is knowing that I'll never follow through  You're slowly killing me  And I wish it wasn't true  Cause I'm so into you    Can you hear me?  Cause I can't change what I've always been    What are you doing to me?  I'm so into you  And the hardest part is knowing that I'll never follow through  You're slowly killing me  And I wish it wasn't true  Cause I'm so into you  I'm so into you  Cause I'm so into you  I'm so into you    Edited to add the video from youtube.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBz-YQZu7...

d2RV8HTmaa	I was thinking that Widmore sent the men who are after Sayid...trying to get rid of the Oceanic 6 because they know about the island.  But...after last night, I am thinking that Ben has orchestrated all of these calamities now facing the 06 in an effort to pressure them in ALL returning to the island.  Remember that Ms. Hawking told Ben that he only has 70 hours to get them ALL back....or "God help us all."  Ben did reveal last night that he was the one sending his "lawyer" (not sure if really a lawyer) to scare Kate into thinking they are trying to take Aaron away...just to get her to run away (to the island with them).  So that's why I think he is also behind what's going on with Sayid and probably even with Sun....and befriending Jack now.    It appears that Charlotte and Miles have been on the island longer than the other people and that is why they are now being affected by the time sickness (temporal displacement).  The reason for that remains unknown at this time.  I'm starting to think that Charlotte is also Widmore's daughter and was born on the island (??). And I think Miles is Dr. Candle's (remember the Asian doctor on the tapes from Dharma) son and also born on the island back in the 70's when Dr. Candle was there.|`|ibiO4VEQaa	I think Ben sent the man, to get Jack to contact Kate and get her and Aaron with the rest of them to go back.    I think Charlotte is/was Annie the redhead from Ben's childhood his only friend, so she would've made contact with the island before any of the survivors.    We saw in the first bit of the premiere the Asian scientist from the DHARMA videos had a wife and baby son on the island, I think it was Miles, so he would've been on the island before any of the survivors too.    Juliet next because she was on the island for 3 years before the survivors. Locke and Sawyer and maybe Jin will get nosebleeds now too. And eventually Daniel I think.    Ben just wanted to get the Oceanic 6 together, it's the only way to save the island. So that's why he pulled that trick on Kate. Aaron probably does have a connection with the island, I think Walt does too.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	No one knows who that man was that shot at Sayid and why he had Kate's address, people say it might be Ben forcing Sayid to come back to the island.    A popular theory is that Charlotte was born on the island and Miles is Dr. Chang's son, also born on the island and that is why they're getting nose bleeds.    Ben doesn't want Aaron, it's just his way of forcing Kate and Aaron to go back to the island.    It's all about getting back to the island and stopping the time jumps!|`|XJGp4AxHaa	The sickness just affects people when they start to have trouble with the jumping through time. Their brain starts to get stuck in the other time that it went to.    Ben wants Aaron since they all need to go back to the island. They can't get back unless they all go together.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I'm guessing Whidmore sent the man to hurt Sayid.  I could be wrong.  I don't know about the time sickness.  Ben is just a jerk, so I think he thinks Kate would be willing to go back to the island to keep Aaron.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	Who sent the man to shoot Sayid with the dart gun and why did he have Kate's address?  i think Ben.  if you notice, they're not trying to kill Sayid. only paralyze him.  then Ben could FORCE Sayid to go to the island. and Kate.      If the time sickness affects people sooner who have spent more time on the Island, why are Charlotte and Miles being affected?   i'm pretty sure Charlotte was born on the island.  and Mile is Dr Pierre Chang's son.  Change is the asian guy from the DHARMA orientation films. he goes by "code names" in the films: Dr Marvin Candle, Dr Edgar Halliwax, and Dr Mark Wickmund.    Why does Ben want Aaron?  remember Claire told Kate NOT to bring Aaron to the island.  maybe he wants to take Aaron from Kate so there's absolutely no way she can have contact with him and bring him to the island.  i think Aaron might be a "devil" in a sense. a bad seed of the Shepherd blood line that will destroy life on the island in the future.|`|MNxxD0h2aa	I think the answer to why he wants aaron is just  to put pressure on kate to go back to the island|`|ETIHOWt9aa	I don't know who sent that man, but it probably was Widmore. Kate was probably next on his list.    I think Charlotte was born on the island and left at a young age, now she is back, but she doesn't remember. that is why on last season finale, she did not want to leave, she is looking for the place where she was born. I have no idea about miles, but probably his been on the island before as well.    Ben told Jack that he was going to help him convince Kate to go back, know we know how he is doing it. He just wants Kate to go back with the rest of them.|`|K45ARg6vaa	I think Aaron is actually Jacob but in a younger form

Dogs tend to be more energetic and universally lovable...few people hate dogs, but a lot of people hate cats (usually for no good reason) or see them as a pet for old ladies or lonely middle-aged women.|`|iMakU3RHaa	I totally agreed with you!|`|oPRmgyXzaa	send disney your ideas|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I agree, I love cats, but the only ones that were any good about cats, are like a hundred yrs old, lol, Aristicats, That Darn Cat, etc, then theres the Garfield movie, but I dont think it any good|`|asGVrqhEaa	I wouldn't be talking about dogs! They help the blind, they find bodies, they track down information on cases. Why do you think they do so many dog movies. And all the dog movies they have done have been awesome! It's just sometimes they pick the wrong people ( Miley Cyrus)  to play the parts.

I turn on the TV in my bedroom and watch...usually I'll see a stupid denny's commercial, and get motivated to go make some breakfast, or if its early enough, get annoyed with whats on (i.e. news, weather, and info-mercials) and finally get up.  LOL!|`|AA10598858	Yeah. Every morning, I go in the living room and kind of nap on the couch, wishing that today would be a snow day and I wouldn't have to move...    Sometimes I fall asleep on accident and wake up late, and it sucks! >.O|`|liup711gaa	yeah like every freakin day lol.....but I just get up cuz I don't feel like laying there just thinking lol|`|e41w1Cmuaa	Do you mean if you have to go to school or work so you don't want to get up, but you don't wanna fall asleep cos you know if you're late you will get killed.

76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	My friends played the guitar and drums. I picked the bass up  so I could be in the band. While I was learning the bass, I started listening to Stu Hamm, Steve Harris, and Geezer Butler and decided that it wasn't a bad choice after all.|`|RG2sckhGaa	I started playing the upright Bass in the orchestra in 4th grade.  It was the natural next step.|`|WtC6A9xYaa	i chose the bass because not as many people play the bass. everyone wants to play guitar. the bass is a great instrument that's a lot of fun to play.|`|XhAFxWG5aa	i chose bass because it kind of keeps the beat and is the under tone almost kind of leading the guitar to be above it. oh and i thought bass would be easier

HZxX9ke8aa	cancer and leo good as friends only. but lets see the rest;    both moons active and social at first sight. probably the first person is more jealous and stubborn because of the aries. while the second person more open-minded and unconventional because of the gemini (emotionally)    both has cancer mercury. so they're going to be emphatetic people both. which is a very good thing for the first person especially.    second person's scorpio mars very dangerous. mars really makes one aggresive and fearless there.    venus; well, the second person will appreciate deeper and meaningful things, finding them much more beautiful. first one will be into shiny things, being much more superficial than the latter.|`|wHL0Jw23aa	Those two usually aren't. We tend to fight a lot! Believe me|`|d69856882943ee44ddbbe3cb4e643f2aaa	There *is* a certain chemistry...both are bound to get attached to each other at some point and maybe then grow apart when they've gotten mad at each other. The compatibility here depends the most on your composite charts, and your happiness as a couple on how harmonious your natal charts are themselves. The most common problem I've seen between leo and cancer, is not ONLY that the leo's self-centeredness bothers cancer (like leo will ignore you in social settings, but be sweet to you and devote their attention to you all the rest of the time, and they will always dramatize their situation but de-dramatize yours, and then they are also fickle so that they don't really call you..ever, and they really have a hard time forcing themselves to do anything, they are not like the cancer, they hate responsibility and, for example, can't see themselves taking care of a fussy baby in the middle of the night, but can easily get down on all fours and play with the kid on the carpet.)    The other thing I've seen is that leo will eventually think cancer is weak once they have broken all the way into their shell and cancer expresses everything it feels. But, cancer is far from weak. Cancer has a lot of motivation and is the survivor of the Zodiac. It's just that Cancer has been taught by his/her father that his/her emotions are very important and are to be taken care of, so he/she gets hurt easily. But this does not make them weak, it just makes them more aware of emotions in themselves and in others. This is exactly what makes Cancer a natural psychologist. Their value system learned from the father is actually a gift, and not a weakness. So, the fact that they notice unfair treatment emotion-wise and give importance to emotions, which actually are important, just like everything else, because everything is a balance, nothing can be neglected...makes them more likely to cry than other non-water signs about unjust treatment emotionally. But here is where Cancer becomes the beacon of light for all the other signs, displaying its cardinal leadership energy. Cancer is the sign that is supposed to make us realize how exactly we messed up our kids, how we are treating our partners all wrong and why they left us, why you have this certain problem, etc. Cancers are very clear-headed. They know the reason for almost everything, making them very wise.    Leo will seem a little ignorant, stupid, or just plain hard-headed and stubborn to cancer at times. You have to realize, cancer, that leo was not taught by their father (the one that creates individuality, specialness, and the ego, the sun) that their own emotions and their safety were important (the moon). They were taught that their own individuality and right to feel special were important (the sun). So, this is why you do not see eye to eye, because leo cannot see everything that cancer sees in regards to emotions, because they are not concentrated on them. So, when cancer starts crying about "nothing important," leo will lose respect for the cancer and not want to be around him/her. Being aware of what made you what you are now, Cancer, all thanks to astrology, you could try explaining to the leo why exactly you are crying, so they could see that it is not foolish. Emotions are the least foolish thing in the world, and if left uncared for will lead us to do things that we later regret and will sure show us that they can have more control over us than our own will-power.|`|t6wmRfoZaa	Last Cancer I was with cried too much for me. but my ego is so big there's only room for one of us in the relationship|`|AA12215623	It depends on whats in the chart. Me and one Leo could've worked out fine. Me and this other Leo, don't speak anymore.|`|BBSRuyNfaa	I'm not an expert at reading charts but based off sun signs yes. They complement each other. The only downfall I have experienced (two happily married couples in my family both of the women are the cancers the men are the leos) is that sometimes the leo's selfishness upsets the cancers sensitivities...other than that they seem to do great:-)|`|ioZeveazaa	No they wouldn't get along. They could probably be friends however Leo is too arrogant and "in the limelight" and Cancer will find this annoying. Trust me. Good luck!

But for you, I will sign anyway.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	I'm not a guy, so my signature doesn't matter, but hey! Some of us round-faced people NEED oversized sunglasses to balance our features!

Nice to know that guys think the same|`|FVDJMWDEaa	i'll join you on the uggs...but i own too many pairs of big sunglasses to join you on that one lol|`|MWSv1yfhaa	I am not a guy but you can count on me.|`|8zJy3jeOaa	um no.

bribxhsdaa	Album was ****ing Dope. And i don't even like Jay-Z too much.    Jigga What/Faint is one of the illest crossover genres/covers i've ever heard.    I might not like Jay-Z has a pure hip hop MC. But the man is the master of the crossover track and spinning hip hop commercially. If you look at what he did at Glastobury, 100's of thousands pure ROCK fans singing the lyrics to "encore".|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I liked it as well.And yes It was a success.|`|BnpBF4rEaa	the album as a whole did not do that well, but Numb/Encore, was the main reason it sold. later they then released Numb/Encore as a single as it was so popular!|`|gUYcVXMTaa	I liked it!

jLvlcoFBaa	Fletch Won is currently in production for a 2009 release.     Joshua Jackson is just rumored to play the part.    He won't be another Chevy Chase but I think he can do a good job with the part.    Fletch Won tells the story of a young Fletch on his first story. When the man Fletch is about to interview turns up dead, Fletch takes it upon himself to figure out who killed him.|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	markwill..., Chevy is the only one that can play John Cock-to-to-toson aka Irwin Fletcher.

And nothing and nobody is insignificant.|`|gZ1XZBBKaa	its one of my favourite movies and favourite songs. and i like jake too. lol. i don't think there is any hidden messages, but i took me a couple of times watching it to understand it. and its amazing.|`|S0Clu20aaa	LOVE THE FILM AND SONG !!!  Its been out for ages and I went through a stage of watching it all the time... You have great taste x I might watch it again some time soon x x   Coz it a mad world !|`|NVUngN45aa	the origional one is better  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZRib_aAQ...    check out the funny dancing|`|6h30kGjDaa	I watched this film when i was 11 and its still my favorite film,when i was 11 and watched it for the first time i was like what the hell is going on but the second time i watched i understood every part and yes i do love the song by gary jules also my favorite.   its a film that really gets your mind thinking.  Luv AbZ XxX|`|EhDFNQ5iaa	we'll there actually really aren't any hidden messages in the film really. And the song is actually a re-make of a song from the 80's i believe.. But they are both amazing. The movie is quite difficult to understand though yes. It took me several, several times of watching it to fully understand. I actually even had to look a few things up as well because everything is made up for the movie so there are just some major parts that weren't explained in it to make sense with other parts.. But once you get it all down it all actually makes sense    By the way, if you have any questions about any parts of the movie feel free to ask :)|`|hKP5sQewaa	That film is great! I forgotten its sheer greatness until i watched the youtube Video! Nobody is totally sure what its about lol, but what we do know is he went back in time to stop his girlfriend from dieing (somehow, something to do with timetravle) It said on the directors cut DVD half way through the film some writing came up saying how every now and then a person can time Travel or see into the future, but its been a long time since ive watched it! Im going to watch it today now!   The rabbit is one freaky thing eh?! Its a very weird but great film! I wander what made the director think of such a weird film? But it is Great, i love the song too, But it sure is a depressing song! :[  "why are you wearing that stupid man suit"  hehe    Hope i helped!! :D|`|0KVws6REaa	Check out the link below.    The song is a cover version of an early 80's hit by Tears For Fears.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	I love the film & song- and I don't really think the song has a hidden message- its primary message is in the chorus and it just has a mysterious sound to the instrumental part of the song which makes you think there might be something more to it.

They have Aspen trees that lost tit's leaves, evergreen trees and some rather large cedars there. It is always good to see that place after a snow as one can catch a glimpse of various birds and an occasional squirrel out and about.   In the morning I have seen deer there as well.     With older houses around it offers a Kincaid  Winter painting look but allows access to the woods behind the park.

It is completely ridiculous, this is very far from there worst allegation. The Sun is scum, even after  Kelvin MacKenzie, who recently said that woman who are seen as unfit mothers should be made infertile, was fired it is still scum and always will be scum.   Many owners, near where I live, will not allow The Sun in their pub, they would rather loose customers than have that disgusting newspaper on their property.   Of course The Sun will say Chanelle looks classy, they think she looks classy when she strips for them.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	You have to remember that the Sun's idea of Classy is going to be far more trashy than anyone elses.  Just as the Sunday times brings tears of mirth to be when they suggest my life will not be complete without an ugly clear perspex chair for 3,500, I can personally guarantee you that when the Sun says "classy" they mean, "we'd like to see her naked".    They don't know what classy is, so they're not taking the mickey - they're quite sad really, like a teenage boy with too much hormones and no girlfriend!|`|AA10077992	OMG!

IFf5r9zAaa	Chuck D took political hip hop to a whole new level. He's a far more skilled lyricist than people give him credit for. His work with the Bomb Squad has created one of hip hop's most unique sounds and he continues to drop knowledge, regardless of whether or not that's what will make him money right now. Unlike many political rappers, he is genuinely intelligent and his work as a political commentator proves this. His voice sounds amazing, and it's instantly recognisable. And he puts on one hell of a live show. Public Enemy have had their ups and downs, but they've never dropped a bad album. And albums like Nation of Millions, Fear of a Black Planet and Apocalypse 91 are classics of the genre.    Cap, are you talking about yourself in the third person now? Second best nothing and you know it.|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	Tupac Shakur-sheer audacity, abrasive in nature, un-clenching truth-teller...the best hands down    Lyrically though my favorite would have to be Nas-"Nas Is Like" & "One Mic" are just some of his masterpeices.  Hip-hop genius whose ability to produce thought-provoking music has been unmatched.    I also really like Slug & Murs   "...I'll take you anyway that I can have you  Bring along your ethics and your issues and your taboos  It's not the standard free bird situation  But your talking to these pieces of a man whose trying to make it  Thru the puzzles, travels, struggles, battles  The body pillow pimp trying to snuggle with my shadow  We could stay proper keep the clothes on, no pressure  Just hold me and pretend like you've known me forever..."  -pure lyrical greatness|`|xmdh8iY3aa	Guru.    He gets criticized for his monotone style and is subsequently underrated because everyone looks at Premo being the genious of the Gang Starr Foundation. But I disagree. I think Guru was essential to the success of Gang Starr and his monotone style is actually an asset. His flow is dope, he's got almost a bass like voice and he's kicked some serious socially conscious lyrics in addition to his bravado. Peep Soliloquy of Chaos, one of my fav Gang Starr tracks.    I saw this kid and his girl having a fight  Another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face  And then the kid pulled out and bust and laid him to waste  A riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews  Started buck wiling tryna snatch kids jewels  After that 50 came and turned the party out  And then the ambulance came to take the body out  And we didnt even get all the equipment out  And we didnt even get to turn the place out  This can happen often and its really f'd up  So Ill ask you to your face homeboy whats up  Did you come to see my show or the stupid ****** playoffs  Killing you and killing me its the soliloquy of chaos    Plus Guru had success on his own, without DJ Premier, with his Jazzmatazz series. He wrote and produced most of those tracks he performed and definitely had a strong influence on the jazz/hip hop fusion of the early 90's.|`|xUxUwloPaa	Meh. I don't think Slug had any outstanding lyrics that would make people gasp. I think when you listen to an Atmosphere record it's more about the vibe and the connection you feel.    "We used to use Apex to play our tape decks/ now we're just having safe sex with fake breasts" -Slug|`|LUGxA6R8aa	nba|`|S7tmJEkGaa	I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies  and hypothesis can't define how I be droppin these  mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery  Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me  Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits  tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics      Wutang - Triumph|`|f6f5c3479ccfabd9b01b2d8b87e5ec81aa	My favorite rapper is Jay-Z. He has shown that he can maintain his presence through the ever-changing landscape of hip-hop. He was mentored by some of the greatest in Hip-hop history (Biggie and Big Daddy Kane) He has several big hits with very different flows on each. He can make a successful album for chart appeal and also create original style like the Black Album and American Gangster. He has appeal across different genres in music. He headlined a show that is traditionally for European rock groups. He's a great business mogul and his wife looks good. I could go on forever.|`|9wUrbqT3aa	NaS -     "So pro-black, I don't pick cotton out da asprin bottle"  "Yo best success, is my worst Blunder"      Arguable the greatest Diss track of all-time "Ether".  Which wasn't a battle between un evenly matched MCs.. he toped Jay-Z at Jay-Z high point in his career    The song "Rewind" - One of the most creative songs ever.  Proved that he can tell a story better than any one else.  He already had "I gave you power" & "1 Love" and others... but this one was classic.    Also social concious music.  An example is "Black Girl Lost" speaks to issue in the Black Community.|`|7c6b95340430de1dc625befda6dbea44aa	i like lupe fiasco  hes a lyrical beast  like in his the coolest-    She would be my queen, I could be her king, together  She would make me cool, and we would both rule, forever  And I would never feel pain  And never be without pleasure, ever, again  And if the rain stops, and everything's dry  She would cry, just so I could drink the tears from her eyes  She'd teach my how to fly, even cushion my fall  If my engines ever stall, and I plummet from the sky  But she would keep me high, and if I ever die  She would commission my image on her bosom, to him  Or maybe she'd retire as well  A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell, and I'll be .."    but u gotta listen to it cant just read it|`|HL8W9yU6aa	Pharoahe Monch is one of my favorites, he has a peculiar way of playing with words, he can approach different subjects and have that soulful tone, the lyrics paint the message in your mind that he's trying to portray, for example, on the song Mayor, i can easily picture the obscurity of the moment and time the character from the story was feeling.|`|u8hsZ7claa	"But tryin to see eye to eye with the faceless,  just ain't working the way the manual paints it"    To quote myself  "my favorite is based on the manner in which he handles the English language" (can't believe I just did that), but it's just that simple to me...The art of rhyme and ability to convey a message is critical in hip hop, and this guy has the uncanny method of creating the most incredible visuals with his words...      "This for the thinkers  This for the urchins allergic to they own stingers  This for the absurd verdict linkers  This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions  but cant remember where his drink is"|`|6fxr3VBGaa	Reasons why AZ is great:  -only guess appearance on the best album of all time and murdered the track  -lyrical content, word play, and rhyme scheme is so concentrated i wonder how the hell he does it  -he is level with Nas on all the tracks they did together and you can argue that he out rapped him on some  -Rather Unique is the most lyrical some of all time IMO  -he rapped about real shyt and keep his style as real as it gets|`|gUYcVXMTaa	Morning Cap,    My fav. rapper is Jay-Z I truly admire him not as a rapper but as a person.  He came up like I did living the pro-jects LOL started out as a small time dealer made his way up to the top then once he had the money left it alone and went into legal ventures that will make him money way pass his death.  The only difference is that I bought a bunch of property with my money!  With the music, the sports bars, the clothing, the basketball team.......and countless other projects the man still has time to provide clean drinking water to those in Africa!  I even named my first born child TeeAnna cause I feed TeeAnna man, ima move keys you can call me the piano man, rain snow sleet hail man, I move E's hydro man!!!|`|q4XUy0Duaa	One of my favorite artists has always been Canibus.  I give him credit for recognizing LL Cool J's bitchassness and calling him out on it, because I always felt the same way.  Also, he doesn't dumb down his lyrics to sell records.  And on top of that, he named himself after my favorite plant.

cVbpywZpaa	pulp fiction no doubt at all!!!!!  john travolta, samuel l jackson, bruce willis,harvey kietel,uma thurman,tim roth.....top class cast, i would say every one of their performances in the movie were excellent, classic soundtrack, fast moving dialogue, just every little thing about it is amazing from the little conversation about the five dollar shake to the short but amazing turn by harvey kietel as mr wolf or the fact that tarantino creates his own brand for things in the movie,like big kahoona burger or red apple cigarettes. this film is one of the greatest ever made, and it thrust travolta bacxk in the limelight and made him an a-lister again, look at his films that followed all big budget box office hits,broken arrow,face off,primary colours and all because of pulp fiction, the best film ever!!!|`|c661ffb50a295d702392241cf59b4170aa	I know it's going to seem like I'm choosing the most famous but really...Pulp Fiction. I held off watching it until about 2 year agos and my boyfriend (new at the time) loved it and made me watch it. I thought I was going to hate it but I ended up loving it. He had seen it so many times that he could appreciate small nuances and stuff and it was great...example: the way John Travolta smokes a cigarette and constantly puts his hand on his stomach. I loved Bruce Willis and "Fabianne" and their chemistry. Uma Thurman was great in the Jack Rabbit Slims scene. Samuel L. Jackson was at his best...It was just a very entertaining movie.Shockingly the only bad thing about it was Quentin's appearance in it. He was too whiney.|`|AA10053661	Pulp Fiction........hands down!    Look at the amazing cast. Look at the amazing elements of the movie. I could go on and on but one moment sticks out the most. I mean when else could a guy get his head totally blown off in the back of a car and you find yourself laughing at the shock of it all while feeling deeply disturbed at the same time. The man is brilliant!|`|PpWosZsIaa	Pulp Fiction. Great Paring of Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta.|`|K7N0pkU8aa	Pulp Fiction    -the chemistry between Samuel L Jackson & John Travolta was priceless  -some of the best movie quotes of all time  -it's hard to beat a funny gangster movie|`|UdwIaCxBaa	A close tie between Pulp Fiction and True Romance.    If you could bottle the magic of Tarantino, then Pulp Fiction is what would occur.  I personally think he's relied too much on his own praise since then, so I think its the raw nature of Pulp Fiction that makes it so special.    I'm looking forward to Inglorios Basterds as I think Tarantino is simply a guy who makes 'cool movies' like KillBill, but needs to branch out and make cool movies that are different from one another. For me Kill Bill and his other movies are simply poor homages to Pulp Fiction.|`|iQAGeVjsaa	Pulp Fiction, it wasn't because it was a new concept, it was the way he put it together, the way he told the story was something that no one had ever really done before.
ThKkn5fKaa	I have both Bernstein and Karajan, but I will admit that the one that I keep coming back to is actually a live recording of Zander with the Philharmonia.  It is a very unique interpretation with strict attention to Mahler's expression markings and articulations.  There is something about it that just feels right to me.  Not to mention I really enjoyed listening to the commentary.  There is a whole CD full of commentary from Zander on his interpretation of each movement, and it is very enlightening.  Listening to the music after hearing him discuss it just makes everything come into focus so much more clearly.  I'm also very happy with the quality of the sound, especially considering the inexpensive price.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Rattle, Abbado and Solti spring to mind immediately....[Can't say that I find the ninth worth listening to myself.]|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	Bruno Walter's recording, despite his obvious personal links with Mahler, I have always found a disappointing Ninth.    Many would say you must have the Barbirolli/Berlin Phil Ninth in your collection. Barbirolli was a profound (if not exciting) Mahler conductor and so this is worth exploring.    Although not always a fan of Haitink in the recording studio (he is so much better live), his Mahler 9 is among the best.    One very personal recommendation is by one of the best but most unrecognised Mahler conductors - Kirill Kondrashin. If you can get a hold of it (I did!), there is a Japanese Altus CD of the very first performance of the symphony in Japan - by Kondrashin and his Moscow Philharmonic in April 1967. This throws a new perspective on what one usually expects from Mahler. But it's so harrowing, it's simply marvellous.
9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I would like to see Mahler at work as a conductor. In his own work primarily but then in other msuic too. So many reports suggest he was one of the greatest of all time and I'd like to have experienced it for myself.    As to Liszt, there is too much superficiality in his music for my liking and I suspect there would have been a great deal of empty showmanship on display. A pianist I would have liked to have seen would be Beethoven - or perhaps Rakhmaninov.|`|PCNsRfJPaa	I would go back with you as he is my favorite.|`|WVLNcDXBaa	I would like to listen Chopin playing his own pieces. I think it would be very interesting , because maybe if we could listen his performances, we would understand better his work.  And I would like to listen Paganini also, because we know that he was an amazing violinist, but nowadays nobody could listen a record with him. And I would like to listen him "live", in concert, because a record can't be so qualitative to reproduce all the "colors" of the artist's music. And also, a record doesn't have the atmosphere and the emotion of a concert.  Interesting question.  All the best!

AA11608168	Good theory, I've always wondered if they ever did kill the right one, but i've always believed she's the right Phyl.....anyway, looking forward to how this plays out!!!|`|LO3BMobRaa	No, because Sheila Carter was brilliant and tactful in her schemes, while Phyllis is just like a spoiled teenager who just takes drastic steps when she can't have her way. I wish Sheila would have killed her.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Wow.  You never know just how many tricks that Phyllis has up her sleeve!!  Don't think it's gonna help her with Nick this time though.|`|a7590c3c5bac6d04d5fbb3e0c50319baaa	THERE IS NO WAY. SHEILA COULDN'T COPY ANYONES WAY OF KISSING AND MORE, PLUS HER PRIVATE FEATURES.|`|lXwIx74xaa	if she is sheila, nick is dumb as a doorknob. i would be glad because when they finally kill of shelia, there won't be any more of her or phylis.
939a573d51518cee62321893077ea36baa	I think phyllis has changed but wouldnt u go over the edge if you found out your husband slept with his slutty cheating ex wife I love nick and phyllis toghter but I am hopeing she doesnt go into old phyllis mode and get herself in big trouble I really hate sharon and nick toghter thier so loveing please thier boreing nick is so more intersting with phyllis|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	I think if she found out that nick and sharon had sex then found out about summer is jacks yeah I would say she will be throughly ticked and maybe go back to her old self|`|lGdzb8aqaa	I have thought this since the birth of the baby. Nick took off for 3 days after he got the DNA results. At the time he was already married to P and he was madly in love with her. I think that the results were that the child was NOT his, he was crushed and instead of being honest and tellling everyone, he choose to LIE to everyone . There is no reason for him to leave for 3 whole days after getting the results unless he was very upset about them. He didn't tell anyone where he was and he didn't show ANYONE the DNA results (the official paper)     Nick was in the plane crash AFTER that, and he liost his memory, I don't think that he remembers that he did this. Now he really believes that Summer is his. I really don't think she is. I wonder if the writers will ressolve this with the whole shar/nick thing. and if Phyllis finds out that Summer is really Jacks, she will want to also keep the secret as she is so crazy about Nick but she won't be able to. but it is also going to be Sharon who goes crazy and starts to act like a crazy woman over Brad,so we are going to be in for a wild ride this month.  I think Jack and Phyllis should reunite     After watching yesterdays scenes, it makes me miss them together. They still have tons of chemistry and are alike in alot of ways. I think they make a better match then Jack&Sharon and Nick&Phyllis in my opinion. Anyone agree?|`|iwqGju5Vaa	I think she's changed, but I can totally see her old self coming out. Perhaps not running anyone over, but doing something dramatic.|`|F9LRKwMyaa	I would love to see Phyllis run Sharon over with her car! That would be awesome!|`|0ZfZulnzaa	Phyllis has not changed at all, look at the way she has been acting, she is still scheming and manipulating and trying to cause trouble, she is going to do what she needs to do in order to keep what is hers, whether it be Nick or whoever she will do what needs to be done!    Her scheming is what got Brad killed, just because she did not want Nick and Sharon alone together.    I would LOVE to see Phyllis and Jack back together, I think they are the best couple, they make the show IMHO. They can get into so much trouble alone, put them together and its just incredible the things they can do!. lol|`|LO3BMobRaa	Phyllis has changed, from bad to WORSE that is, and she'd most likely conceal Summer's identity to hold on to Nick just like she did Daniel Romalotti Sr. If she does come up against Sharon, I hope Sharon takes a lesson from Dru's book and beat Phyllis unconscience.|`|6RTqwCc7aa	I totally agree with Sask Arie.  I love the Phyllis character as much as I love the Sharon Character.  I do not like that they have Phyllis with Nick.  He calmed her way to much and Jack and Sharon was just torture.  Put the couples back where they belong.  MAN...wasn't that the hottest scene with Sharon and Nick hooking up in the cabin!

667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	Danielle Russo, she was Alex's mom.  Not sure what happened to her on the island yet, but her younger self was a lot prettier than her old self, I guess living on the island and all she endured did it to her.  She didn't have Ben's baby ,he stole her.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	Danielle Rousseau has been on LOST since the pilot when we hear her voice coming through the radio Sayid, Charlie, Kate, Sawyer, Boone, and Shannon all take into the jungle.    then she appeared several episodes later when she held Sayid captive in her bunker.|`|aSG5lHrwaa	russo is the  woman who is alex's mother , bens daughter   at least thats wat i think .  hope i helped   but its good to see a lost fan out there   ^_^|`|b71a9fcb4e3cb531cd27f67e3f40102daa	Russo was the French woman that left the audio recording, found in the first few episodes of Season 1.    She was played by Mira Furlan, and appeared a couple of times in the first 3 seasons. She was the one that Sayid found, by following the cables, and she was the one that warned the group about the others.    She told the Oceanic survivors that her baby was taken by the Others 16 years before they arrived.    Any of that ring a bell?|`|FplTPoAyaa	She is the French woman that showed up on the island, I believe in season 1.  She had an affair with Ben and had a daughter, Alex.  She was living in hiding on the island, away from The Others.  The castaways discovered her and she became a somewhat ally of theirs.  She didn't know her daughter, Alex, was still alive until the castaways and she found the Others camp and discovered that Alex was living there with her father, Ben.  She was killed last season, but she was a tough cookie.|`|7CsLJ4I8aa	FYI:  It's Rousseau|`|AA10954273	Danielle Rousseau is the French woman who showed up in the first season.  She's Alex's mother.  This means Jin was approximately 16 years before the plane crash.|`|ETIHOWt9aa	That girl was Danielle Rousseau, the French chick that came out in season 1, but died in season 4. She is Alex's mother, as we saw she was pregnant. Rousseau told Sayid and the rest of the survivors that she got there by boat and that the boat crashed, it was true.

RUoXZmYFaa	Actually, you CAN search by things other than the film's title on Netflix.  You just need to type an actor or director's name into the search bar and it will come up with a link to their film reel.  And though it only shows large write-ups of a few of their films, you can also see a detailed list to the right of that that shows all of their films that Netflix has to offer.    The pros of Netflix are the convenience of renting a movie from your home, not having to worry about late fees or a trip to the rental store, the ability to keep a list of movies you want to see in your queue for easy access, and the comfort of being able to browse thousands and thousands of titles as you search for the one you want.  And you can watch online now or through your TV (thanks to Netflix compatible devices).    As for the cons? I hear the envelopes are not the right size for the US Postal service and that kind of gets on their nerves.  :)|`|2oGc1tuCaa	You can use those criteria.|`|urmhRHwxaa	I love Netflix and have used it for about seven years now.    Pros?  They have a wide selection, no late fees, a reasonable pricing structure based on how many movies you take out at a time, more and more movies are available for download from their website, and you don't have to bother going into a video store again.    Cons?  In the past, Netflix was accused of "throttling"...that is, favoring their newer customers and those who return movies less frequently.  This does happen sometimes, but not enough for me to want to get rid of it.  I live in a big city, so typically, I dump the movies off on Monday, they arrive early Tuesday morning at Netflix, and I have a new batch Wednesday or Thursday.    If you need a better search criteria, I would suggest using the IMDB (us.imdb.com) as a reference in conjunction with your Netflix queue.
1pVuLZ0Iaa	I agree! Tamara is a little bit more on the "Mental Institution" crazy side and she doesn't seem to have that much common sense either. IT is just kinda slow.|`|KcixQp5Raa	I just watched it yesterday and I have to say Tamara is as dumb as a box of ROCKS!    thank goodness she's gone!|`|AOZvz2dpaa	i think she is just plain dumb    That Entertainer dude is kinda duhh too|`|VFVdrDBQaa	The two of them are equally ignorant and almost incomprehensible at times.  She cracked me up last night with her tirade but "It" uses words that he doesn't know the meaning of and butchers them.  They should hook up and move to Idiocracy. (if you've seen the movie you get it)  I have socks with a higher IQ than those two knuckle heads.|`|LHSeSvR2aa	I am so glad that Tamara is gone she is flighty she drives me nuts.  plus at the end of the show when she was yelling at everyone saying that she is better and that embarresed her in front of live tv.  she would not shut up so she embarresed herself!  now i just need to see that Frenchie gone.  she makes me sick i cant stand looking or even hearing her.  she is dumb!|`|w6czQwhBaa	tamara is dumber
Tbb6frbraa	Hands down you're lookin for "rocket 88" ... see rock n' roll was actually started by african americans, it grew out of rhythm and blues..  In 1947 there was a popular rhythm n blues song called "cadillac boogie" this song was adapted by Ike Turner who wrote "rocket 88" to record with his band The Kings of Rhythm.  On an early spring morning in 1951 they kicked up the tempo and recorded rocket 88 as the first ever recognized rock n' roll song, although the credit for the song went to his saxophone player, Jackie Brenston, and went down in history as being performed by "Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats" ...  This is a historical inaccuracy..  Also most early rock n roll songs were written and performed by blacks and then re-recorded by white artists and those were the versions accepted in american culture..  So you're best luck for finding this song on an album is the re-recorded version by Jerry Lee Lewis...  amazon or ebay... as far as record stores: blackhole records, amoeba records, bionic records... those are the only ones i can think of that would have a good old school album..|`|bKtpUETnaa	go to a old record store|`|b5018c41eade53d7d315f669b34387a9aa	Buddy Holly Ebay
tLI94qWNaa	Yes, it is a beautiful movie.  Very sad and this movie will melt your heart.  Not only are the characters in this movie so life like, but the acting is just out of this world.  You dont have to go in with any expectations, none are needed, it is just an amazing movie that will go down in history.  One of heaths best movies in my opinion.  You have to see it, at least just once.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	It's great, even for straight people like you and I|`|8419d1a15767e35c02a2bbc81278a330aa	Good Acting! Great scenery.

If you're a homophobe who can't take guys kissing once or twice, then it's not the movie for you.    And it's Brokeback Mountain. Not Mountain.|`|Mcz3IjNgaa	no prolly not. you wouldnt like it|`|64301a6c9e237f4dbdcc89a89faf2792aa	Well, I actually enjoyed Brokeback Mountain.  There is a few man on man "sex" scenes where Heath Ledger & Jake Gallenghaal in a tent but they don't show anything.  However, it is more than a "gay" love story.|`|2ea3b1109a1954597d6e6877c0d98075aa	Very good film actually infact the 'gay theme' isnt what its about, its the fact real love transcends sexuality, you can have a deep love for another person and this film shows that another person can affect you, regardless of whether they are a man/woman, trust me when you watch it, you wont be thinking why are two men doing what they do, it actually means something more significant, I was impressed by the level of acting from Heath & Jake, the film was definitely worthy of awards!

Do you want him to be?|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	What kind of question is this? There is no indication that he is gay. He seems to love females. Angelina. Jennifer. Gwyneth. And so on and so on. Stop fantasizing. He's straight.|`|VFVdrDBQaa	I heard a rumor about very attractive, popular male musicians and celebrities.  The theory is that they can have pretty much any woman they want.  They can expect their every needs to be met.  They become hungry for something different.  It's like topping out on a drug.  You have to try something new when the same old same old stops getting you high.  So the theory is that they experiment with anyone/anything that's different and "untapped".  Just a theory I heard somewhere.|`|89TgOjXpaa	No, he's married to Angelina Jolie|`|OlxVG5eXaa	If he likes men, he's done a great job keeping on the down low.    Clay Aiken does enough of the "look at me, I'm gay" act for everyone.|`|HBFHZXybaa	If he was gay, then why would he be dating the hottest woman in the world?.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	Trust Me that man is not gay at all, not only that he is hot but he is partnered with Angelina and has 3 bio children with her.|`|uIg6an6Jaa	probably|`|r2iMJgIqaa	BESIDES THE FACT THAT HE IS MARRIED TO ANGELINA JOLIE AND HAS KIDS WITH HER..........NO!!!!!!|`|KdCzS5Q4aa	No, he's married to Angelina Jolie and they have something like 70 children.|`|VNum3TKyaa	OMG no you didn't........

I hated the way her face looked while she sang, I could barely watch. I did think it was sad though when she was smiling at the camera and acting like the usual Bikini Girl, but as soon as she got into her hotel room and didn't know the cameras were still there she started crying... I feel sorry for her, it just shows how sad and insecure she is to act the way she does.|`|fk9AvB25aa	Sorry but I am not sorry to see her go, she doesn't deserve a moment of silence for reducing her group to a train wreck. If I remember right she didn't bother to comfort her fellow group members because she didn't want to be "fake". To me she is the most fake person of any one I know. She made a fool out of herself for posing after all of that.|`|iddMxOroaa	Send this to Kara, she would have an orgasm reading this!|`|YFcrDpDeaa	God I am so glad she is gone so I don't have to look at her making retarded "sexy" faces.. she was a total "butter face" aka hot "but" her face... they needed to brown paper bag her!|`|buUTakKAaa	ugh i hate that girl    she symbolizes everything i hate in a girl    stuck up, slutty, nasty, biattch, rude, dumb as hell, ....the list goes on|`|l0rKjtUDaa	YAAAAAYYYYYYY!!!!

You look stupid.|`|12Nou1pvaa	honestly i think she was like a set up made by the producers to cause a buzz, she has no talent, other than showing off her body, her parents must be soo proud|`|ORwz7nzJaa	i don't like that girl.  she doesn't sing well. i don't like her voice.  and she's so annoying... she can't be a great singer.
T1ffrjHAaa	We all make a judgement on people we meet based on our impression of them, this could be things such as looks, manner, friendly personality and the like and based on what we feel we can usually make our own mind up about the people around us or in our life. When this type of judgement is based on a "celebrity" it is usually based on what type of the person or character that we "believe" them to be. Factors that can influence that include how the press and magazine portray them. In cases of celebrity, fame or fortune you will also find that jealousy is a factor.    Im sure that she has many people who like her and love her dearly and who know she is a good person, but I bet that these are people who know her. Its the ones that don't who spread the dislike.    I think shes nice by the way. Good luck to her, that's what I say !|`|MSqYCPd7aa	who ever said she is desirable to us guys........|`|9fcLSbbwaa	I think shes really pretty and people are just jealous.

Misty sunrise in my hometown,   Rows of cotton bout knee high,  Mrs. Baker down the dirt road,  Still got clothes out on the line,    Erwin Nichols there with Judge Lee,  Playin checkers at the gin,  When I dream about the southland,  This is where it all begins    From Carolina down to Georgia,  Smell the jasmine and magnollia,  Sleepy Sweet home Alabama,  Roll tide roll,  Muddy water, Misssissippi,  Blessed Graceland whispers to me,  Carry on, Carry on,  Sweet Southern Comfort carry on,    Catchin catfish on the river,  Chasin fireflies by the creek,  Kissin Debbie Williams sister,  On the porch Homecommin week,    With rusty cars and weeping willows,  Keepin watch out in the yard,  Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie,  Could be anywhere you are,    In Carolina or in Georgia,  Open arms are waitin for ya,  Louisianna yellow rose of San Antone,  Arkansas, Mississippi,  Old man river whispers to me,  Carry on, Carry on,  Sweet Southern Comfort carry on,    As I sit here I'm surrounded,  By these priceless memories,  I don't have to think about it,  There's no place I'd rather be,    In Carolina or in Georgia,  Smell the jasmine and magnollia,  Sleepy Sweet home Alabama,  Roll tide roll,  Muddy water, Misssissippi,  Blessed Graceland whispers to me,  Carry on, Carry on,  Sweet Southern Comfort,  Carry on, Carry on,  Sweet Southern Comfort carry on|`|1UKAho1iaa	I'm From The Country- Mark Chesnutt.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Take this job & shove it(LOL).

Lfc9Zav2aa	Smashing Pumpkins  song Butterfly with bullets "despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage"|`|aCcRsh7uaa	It's technically a Pantera song, but with Dimebag Darrell doing the vocals.  It was written for the Supercop soundtrack, which you can find here:    http://www.amazon.com/Supercop-Original-...    It is NOT on any Pantera or Damageplan albums, and the lyrics are nowhere to be found.  Good luck, hope this helps!|`|c6NbAVgraa	I know this is a stupid answer, but Google it! I think you already know that?|`|HGw3qqC4aa	Sorry|`|qkblT2hgaa	Try www.getlyrics.com|`|l9jtfrU4aa	I think this is the song you're talking about....    Smashing Pumpkins, Bullet with Butterfly Wings.  1995 double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.    The world is a vampire, sent to drain  Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames  And what do I get, for my pain?   Betrayed desires, and a piece of the game    (chorus)  Even though I know - I suppose Ill show  All my cool and cold-like old job  Despite all my rage Im still just a rat in a cage (2x)  Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved  Despite all my rage Im still just a rat in a cage    Now Im naked, nothing but an animal  But can you fake it, for just one more show?   And what do you want, I want to change  And what have you got when you feel the same    (chorus)    (chorus 2)  Tell me Im the only one  Tell me theres no other one  Jesus was an only son  Tell me Im the chosen one  Jesus was an only son for you    (chorus)  (chorus 2)    Despite all my rage Im still just a rat in a cage  Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved  Despite all my rage Im still just a rat in a cage  And I still believe that I cannot be saved      Hope this helps,  -Pandora-      EDIT:  Never mind; that wasnt the song you were referring to. The only lyrics I found for Caged in a Rage were too inappropriate to be posted on this site, and even at that Im not sure if they were the right lyrics.  Sorry I couldnt be of more help. Ill do some more research and try again later.
1eQcq4eZaa	of course they are not for everyone, not even everyone who likes metal    for me, their vocal delivery is not my favorite style, but it is tolerable...but sometimes I prefer to hear death metal growls over Dani's shrieks (my favorite metal is classic thrash, though)    regarding the music, I believe it is pretty awesome...the guitar work is splendid, rife with riffs, and they throw in plenty of ambience with the keyboard and other instrumentation    I give them one and one half thumbs up|`|8EO7DCogaa	filthy|`|HjOpieXLaa	i think they're really amazing, their song are awesome.  the vocalist has a good voice.

"The first three times,my wife didn't like the color."|`|oC8U5Bl5aa	my daughter, soon to be 19 in march, started college last august. i didn't send her off to a major university, just a junior college because you receive the same education just like the big schools but for a lot less money. she still lives at home and we are very proud of her. moving out into the real world can be overwhelming and scary but i'm sure you will do just fine. it takes a little while to get used to and you will eventually get the "hang" on things. good luck and take your time, there's a whole new world out there. just remember whatever you put your mind to you can achieve it, always have faith in yourself.

oYcA2x4jaa	You are the girl in the Tub.  You are at odds with yourself. You know that there's something wrong with you. You know it's ugly and you weren't always like that.     You are also the Brunette girl. You want to be able to like yourself, but can't.     Explaining your just helping to the brunette is your subconscious telling you that you can't currently face the things that are wrong.     That is what the dream is saying.|`|uXw553Wkaa	well we might need some information about your REAL life. do you have female friends who might symbolize the people in the dream? maybe you think one of them likes you.|`|2VNmxfgpaa	It sounds like the answer to the mystery comes when you describe your feelings about the brunette at the end of the dream:    "There's nothing wrong with her...(remember there was something wrong with the other girl's face)...she likes me...she comes back to me when I walk away...but I'm just not interested, and I don't know why...I'm not jealous if she's with someone else...I'm just not interested, do I need a reason?"    Sometimes if we don't click with someone we don't really need a reason not to be with them.  Your dream tells you that's perfectly OK.|`|XFHNY69Gaa	yes, i think i can help, i hve come across many people who experience dreams like you in my area of expertise- a dream decoder...  anyway, those who have dreams like these tend to be losers who have no social life so they make things, post them on sites and like this and act like they're all that.. does this sound like you?    Alternatively, you could just be experienceing something i like to call ' a weird, no-name, completely and utterly random dream' with no explanation to it. hope this helped hun...

7WybdnLjaa	I think they have problems just like everyone else on the planet does. The problem starts when they don't believe they are like everyone else or when everyone else doesn't believe they are like everyone else. Unfortunately, if we raise our kids to believe that those in the public eye (such as celebrities) are great role models, we will always feel a back lash when they "goof up". What happened to kids looking up to their parents? Perhaps we parents need to be better role models and we wouldn't react so benevolently when another human being is imperfect.  In addition to that, I think many (if not most) celebrities live outside the real world so long they can no longer associate or live in reality. If I ever meet one that I feel is down to earth and real, well they will most definitely be one in a million.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	Lindsey is cool. But paris just needs to be extinct.

AGMUa20Oaa	People say personality, and that is bull***! The first thing is attraction, so the person has to look good(maybe for you and not for other people). Then, I think is important the personality and if they are good providers.  Loyalty and honesty is important, but develops through the relationship.|`|RBQrgByeaa	Helen Keller.|`|WbKBHh8Haa	Honesty, Loyalty, real|`|6jM9aAAvaa	love and ambition|`|RcCJSSMPaa	CHARLIE SHEEN    LOL J/K  intelligence, respect, sense of humor, and if he's good looking and smells good..WOW!!!!|`|NB5Dr7Nzaa	Chocolate dipped strawberries, an extremely soft blanket, and a vibrator.. Hehe, just kidding.  I would really like a man who has an understanding of God.  A complete package would start with a man who isn't playing games and would let me know that he really likes me and wants to spend time with me.  Then he would hopefully be kind, but silly and like to goof off.  Not for my selfish reasons but because it shows good character he should have a job.  And I love a thinker- someone who makes me think.  Looks aren't a dier requirement, but there would have to be a physical attraction in order to have a healthy desire for "chemistry".  This is getting too long so I'll wrap up with friendship- I would want a man who is as interested in having a strong bond as a friend as well as a lover.

JPDxyTT3aa	i agree. my sister in law who is 15 had something sim. happen to her recently and they are saying she gave concent bc she was "wet" and thats the sheriff talking. i cant believe that crap. and they wonder why women dont come forward when stuff like this happens. they never do anything. just sad.|`|vQG6fDFeaa	He should get tied with barb-wire... and have someont go to work on him with plyers and a blow torch.|`|rnMZHdCraa	A dude 86 years old should come and rape him, see how he likes it.|`|zV0IPFIVaa	Hang Him.|`|suLTN10laa	Even though I admittedly do not know all the facts in the story...  I agree.    2 reasons:  1. when I was 16, I thought I knew EVERYTHING, turns out I didn't know sh...crap!    2. adults should know this about teens!  Especially if he, himself has teenagers!  Why would a real middle aged man want "relations" with a CHILD as young as his!?!  ANSWER:  A real man wouldn't!  A real man would be disgusted at the thought  And last but not least, my own opinion:  Once an abuser, ALWAYS an abuser.  He needs to do more than "ask for forgiveness" he should do time, even if he does just get community service with a good lawyer...the public humiliation is good for him|`|Tv8VHoeCaa	Yes. He should be ashamed of himself.    But that said.. there are hundreds of such people that i personally see everyday here in Southern China doing the same.    They stroll into hotels with 16, 17 ,18 year old girls and they are 50, 60, even 70 years old.....      Poverty is the real criminal.  Many are explioted because they are poor.    Life.   you guys have it good living in USA, Britain... etc...  The poor countries like India, China, ... even Thailand and the Philippines....      Life is unfair.|`|IP2suWFTaa	Yea,that's not right.He will pay the consequences for what he has done.|`|wwzoqIvVaa	Young girls make aging men feel younger.

Being a father myself, I would most likely you want to take my anger out on him personally.|`|nAK82h6vaa	Your right he should be castrated,Alot of sick people out there.|`|GRyFxwTbaa	Remember, forgiveness and punishment are entirely separate issues.    You can forgive him as he rots in prison.|`|13fDE4nGaa	I guess if the "YOUNG WOMEN" was of legal age of consent    Why should it matter to any body the guys AGE?    if she haves sex with an older man she is old enough to know what she is doing    Maybe it is about time the young Lady's start facing some charges as well if they are underage and "LIE" about there ages   this happens every day all across the country.    Horny old men will not go away        UNFORTUNATELY    Lieing little Prick teasers wont either|`|ym04vDkcaa	he sholdnt be forgiven hes sick|`|4TmN5Dohaa	I do and I am a fifty year old male, who  has grandchildren.|`|sxYR3WU6aa	WHAT A SAINT!!!

GRRRR|`|kg6H6HDuaa	I have and it was scary|`|6UlOorwMaa	as a matter of fact I have, I lit candles all over the bathroom, it was kind of nice|`|P9wMY4Zpaa	Yeah i used to do it all the time, cuz mom would wake me up in the morning to take a bath before school and the light would hurt my eyes, so i just bathed without one on. now i do it now and again just for fun. ;)|`|ZNViGvidaa	yes i've been 'bathed' in the dark.  thank goodness i had a towel near by
0wE0r0Tbaa	Yeah! You've actually picked my two favourties!  Also The Mist- The film overall isn't even that good, but the ending is just so disturbing! It was a real shocker. If you haven't seen it, then you should! Sit through the crappy film and wait till the end, it's worth it!    Also, Unbreakable's quite a good one! I never saw that ending coming!  I just love the film. Films that can always catch me out at the end are the best, not any of that predictable crap :)|`|35ccc8ce58bda98ad049f1093b5a126aaa	Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.|`|GK3wBfTHaa	Hmmm I would have to say. Not going to really give away the twist but there are two I can think of right now. I know there are more but too tired. ;0D    Black Christmas - Very disturbing and when the whole truth came out about the relations and how many were actually involved. That was a sick twist I did not see coming.     Shattered -  Didn't see that ending coming and I pride myself on figuring out these things. I even guessed on the Sixth Sense. But I only had one part of the movie figured but the ending was...wow should have seen it coming.|`|32jXRHX9aa	Best one ever is in the Usual Suspects|`|tLI94qWNaa	I have to agree with you on the sixth sense and the others, both of those movies had amazing endings, so twisted and just awesome.      1. The ending of all the saw movies, I mean they just keep on coming out with amazing twists and you never see them coming, I Just love that about these movies.     2. The ending of the movie Oldboy, I never thought that Mi-do was Dae-su Oh daughter, and he slept with her, just twisted.|`|Tp2VuKzeaa	Great! Now I have found out the ending to Sixth Sense when I was planning on watching it haha.

aihogb26aa	I would be pretty positive that they know...first, by the time the contestants get in front of the judges, they have already been through at least 3 other auditions and interviews with producers and they do have to fill out a personal questionnaire. Plus, the producers like to exploit the juicy backstories because it gets viewers emotionally involved in the contestants. And I have to admit that it totally worked with me for Danny...i was totally hooked from his story AND his voice. He's a very impressive guy.|`|AA12390047	They did an on-air story about Danny and I know the judges saw that.  I like him.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I am impressed with him regardless of his back story but yes I do believe the judges are aware because they have to fill out a questionnaire before they get to the judges in try outs.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	Yeah, they put that information and stuff on the sheet I think.. I want him to win. He's brilliant.|`|AA11452399	He is a good singer so what does his story matter? They all have stories, some just sadder than others. Makes no difference to me as far as voting or talent goes and it shouln't to anyone else either.

But kudos to Danny for not milking it like Daniel did on the last series of X-Factor (the current British equivalent of Idol), who managed to exhume the stories of his dead missus at the slightest sign of defeat.

RNNdRHrMaa	Dont stop the Rock by Freestylers,  if you read the info on the video, it would have told you.    I love the advert though|`|fb5e6abe0d15467cb8e98fd9cd776d9daa	Let me clear this up, 'cos it's a bit confusing. The track is called Don't Stop the Rock and is by Freestyle. It is NOT by the Freestylers, they sampled this tune on their album We Rock Hard, giving this sample tune the title Drop the Boom and the Freestylers also took their name from Freestyle. Hope that makes sense (this all took me a while, it's that confusing. And I'm a big Freestylers fan...) I can't find a link to the Freestylers tune so you'll just have to trust me, or buy the We Rock Hard album, which is awesome.

Klw3Ke3Haa	Yes I love Tsundere characters. I agree with you they can be kind of bitchy sometimes but I love how well they are made up. One of my favs is Rin Tohsaka from Fate/Stay Night.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	Suzumiya Haruhi owns your soul.|`|JgCGpQaxaa	Tsundere are annoying as hell when they don't grow out of their tsuntsun nature.    I'm thinking of the end of the second season of Zero no Tsukaima, as a prime example.  Louise and Saito essentially have been married, and for pretty much half the episode (days or weeks in her time) Lousie believes that Saito is dead.  She is in tears, and would give practically anything for Saito to return.  However, practically 10 seconds after their joyful reunion, she already gets pissy at him and once again starts calling him an "idiot" and a "dog."   Now I can understand that this is the way Saito and Louise relationship works, but if she can't go a whole minute without the tsuntsun after she is reunited with the man she admittedly loved and believed to be dead, I can't help but facepalm repeatedly.  I ask myself, "Has their relationship developed AT ALL this season?"  and I have to answer, "No... it has not."    It's this kind of crap that really, REALLY turns me away from the tsundere characters.  Essentially a tsunderekko doesn't like to admit that she is in love.  But if she has already admitted that she loves someone, and he and everyone else knows it, and SHE knows it, and heck, they've GOTTEN MARRIED, I would like to see some character developement, and see her tone down the tsuntsun at least a little bit.  I'd LOVE to see a character like that.    Edit: Actually, now that I think about it, it's really just the recent characters that piss me off.  Lighter Tsunderrkos like Madoka Ayukawa from Kimagure Orange Road (it's from the 80s) actually GROW and DEVELOP.  And as they realize they are falling in love, they don't act completely retarded 100% of the time as a defense mechanism.|`|xJOM4hWHaa	My favorite character type would be the oranyan (male tsundere), more than the tsunderekko.     imo tsunderekko > yanderekko/yangirekko (especially after watching School Days).     In the end, I guess I can't say I like or dislike female tsundere characters.|`|oH0u3RxJaa	My thoughts on tsundere...well their usually characters who are initially jerkasses for whatever reason, and soon warms up to the main character.     They MIGHT have been the results of the feminist movement (indirectly anyways), since these characters didnt exist in the past, where characters in ALL sorts of stories (not just anime) were all...basically the ideal submissive butterfly. Tsundere is still relatively new, My view on them is...so-so. They can be entertaining at times, but I just hate Soryu Asuka Langley...and its really hard to give a GOOD reason for a girl to be a Tsundere. The best is probably Nagi, from hayate o gotoku. And obscenely rich tsundere that solves all of life's problems with excessive money.   In the end though, I probably prefer yamato nadeshiko's more...of course that probably because I'm a male...   Now Yandere on the other hand, me love!! Yandere's are hot...but thats because I like cute little girls...with the occasional dangerously psychotic moments, like Lucy from elfen lied.   Fun fact: I used to mix yanderes and tsunderes up a lot. And thought they were the same.

yxVN1Etaaa	Finger independence is the ability to move each finger individually without needing help from another finger at all.  It is a key factor in playing guitar, piano, and any other instrument that requires your fingers to be used across a large range of fingering positions.  Some people are just naturally capable of this but most have to train themselves with finger exercises to establish that there is not finger dominance and that all of the fingers can be used with the same speed and precision.  Most guitarists will seldomly use their "pinky" finger which (with there being only four fingers on the fret hand) literally cuts out 25% of their potential playing skill.

3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	I don't know that much about Roth.  But if he's a gore master, then Cell ought to be right up his alley.  There was certainly plenty of gore in the book.  The question is whether Roth will tell the story, or he'll get so absorbed in the gore that the story goes by the wayside.    However ... in the book, King himself came pretty close to over-pushing the gore at the expense of the story (IMO of course).  If Roth does the same thing, then at least the Cell movie could be considered a faithful adaptation of King's writing to film, which is more than can be said for a lot of other King stories that have been made into movies.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Ooooh.  Eli Roth on a Stephen King novel.  Well, I think Eli Roth will do a good job with this. Cell (the book) was amazing, and very bloody and gory, so I think it's right up Eli Roth's alley.

WlEOO8Luaa	don't forget the 'e' in Basterds.    I don't doubt that this will be a classic by Tarantino. You're right on your opinion of Death Proof...kinda lame.    But, a group of Jewish-American Nazi-hunters in WWII Germany? and starring Brad Pitt? I have a hard time seeing this as lame. I like to think this will be a Brad Pitt a la "Fight Club" and "12 Monkeys" rather than "Troy" or "Legends of the Fall"|`|b1d94518579dc9e27a499adab10f47e4aa	I think Inglorious Basterds could be among his greatest films.  The cast is an ecclectic array of stars and "hey I know that guy!" type of people.  Having read the script, I have to say it was pretty enthralling and exciting.  And assuming the script is about the same as the film, yes, there will be blood!  I think the film will keep Brad Pitts recent track record looking great (Babel, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and I could actually see it garner Tarantino an Oscar nom for Best Director, if it lives up to its potential.    Also, it is not a remake of the other Inglorious Basterds, just the title and premise is an homage to the 1978 film.|`|aCcRsh7uaa	While I agree that Death Proof was by far Tarantino's worst movie, I really think that Inglourious Basterds (the incorrect spelling is intentional, that is how the name of the movie is spelled) is going to be amazing.  I haven't seen the original, but based on the cast of the remake alone I can think of nothing but great things.  Let's run through the list: Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, Mike Myers, and BJ Novak, all with music by Ennio Morricone.  How could it not be cool?

I am a virgo and whenever I meet virgo men I'm usually not attracted to them but they understand me so well and know just what to say that our connection is one that can't be stopped! It's just my luck that most of the time I never meet virgo guys or the timing is completely wrong!|`|o2FJIXS9aa	Basically bad. I am a sun and moon Pisces and while I like Pisces women as friends, but I just find Pisces men too weak-willed and sneaky. I cannot even match their lying capacities! I guess I need something a little stronger. Oddly enough, I do know a few couples who are both Leos and have been married a long time. When you ask them how it works, they always say they are very different types of people. Madonna and Sean Penn are both Leos and that seemed to work for a while. Maybe you just didn't find the right Leo guy. Good signs for you to try might be your opposite sign Aquarius (not much head butting there), Sagittarius, Aries, Libra.|`|72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	I can definitely understand that you and your ex Leo didn't make it very long because two Leo's together is a lot of work in the relationship. It's almost impossible but that depends on the two Leo's. Leo's want to be the center of attention in their own ways and want the spotlight. Not just that Leo's are headstrong and when you got two Leo's together neither one of them is going to want the other to be the boss or tell them what to do. It's just a lot, but I'm sure the sex and passion is good when two Leo's are together. Both are fire signs so there shoulf b a lot of fireworks in the bedroom. I'm a Sagittarius and my boyfriend of 7 years is a Leo. We are perfect together. Sagittarius is more laid back in personality and I think that's what a Leo needs to give the relationship balance. Now as far as me dating someone with the same sign. I have been there done that too! lol. I dated another Sagittarius when I was 16 years old. (I'm 28 now) anyway, we dated two years and it was the worst relationship of my life. I also think that what added to everything was the fact that we were both young too. He was two years older than me at the time but still, we were young. He was just one of the worst guys I have ever encountered and he was abusive on top of everything. He had a lot of issues but in all honesty I don't think the way he was had anything to do with him being a Sagittarius. Come to find out his father was abusive to his mother and wasn't a very good father to him and his siblings so I think in his case it was his upbringing. I have been around a lot of other Sagittarius men that were really nice and charming. I just happened to have a relationship with one that didn't turn out so good.|`|weL7rkWDaa	Dating my own sign was  good the one thing i liked the best is the fact that we could remain friends even after the fact we broke up.

AA11784502	Hello ,  "The Mikado is a comedy that deals with themes of death and cruelty. This works only because Gilbert treats these themes as trivial, even lighthearted issues. For instance, in Pish-Tush's song "Our great Mikado, virtuous man", he sings: "The youth who winked a roving eye/Or breathed a non-connubial sigh/Was thereupon condemned to die /He usually objected." The term for this rhetorical technique is meiosis, a drastic understatement of the situation. Other examples of this are when self-decapitation is described as "an extremely difficult, not to say dangerous, thing to attempt", and also as merely "awkward". When a discussion occurs of Nanki-Poo's life being "cut short in a month", the tone remains comic and only mock-melancholy. Burial alive is described as "a stuffy death". Finally, execution by boiling oil or by melted lead is described by the Mikado as a "humorous but lingering" punishment.  Death is treated as a businesslike event. Pooh-Bah calls Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner, an "industrious mechanic". Ko-Ko also treats his bloody office as a profession, saying, "I can't consent to embark on a professional operation unless I see my way to a successful result." Of course, joking about death does not originate with The Mikado. The plot conceit that Nanki-Poo may marry Yum-Yum if he agrees to die at the end of the month was used in A Wife for a Month, a 17th century play by John Fletcher. Ko-Ko's final speech affirms that death has been, throughout the opera, a fiction, a matter of words that can be dispelled with a phrase or two: being dead and being "as good as dead" are equated."     =^,,^=

If two people form a Grand Trine with each other, no matter what the planets are, they will compliment each others lives.  2. Chiron points the way to your Soul Mate. There are 2 main aspects. Chiron Jupiter and Chiron Neptune. When these planets for a trine, conjunction, parallel or contra-parallel in geocentric or heliocentric charts you are looking at the soul mate aspects.  3. Watch out for dangerous clashes. There are quite a few to look for. The Chiron square Chiron is called the Separate Ways Clash. It is caused by being born about 13 to 18 years apart. Many times people with this aspect will stay together for many years and still end up going their separate ways. A Saturn Juno clash is also very bad. Saturn Chiron is the heartbreak clash. This can be over come and because Chrion rules the family, many times what we see is the source of the heartbreak might be a family member other than the spouse, but many times it comes from the spouse as well.  4. Most astrologers will disagree with this one. Juno doesn't point to marriage. Juno rules the love affair and increases the chance of people becoming intimate but it also rules spells, and as such, fades away with time. It rules marriage without children and children without marriage. But Juno rules the NEED for sex and is the most powerful of the sexual planets.

BBSRuyNfaa	Not a guy, but most guys I date are cancers..they love a humble woman, not too flashy, smart, caring, intellectually stimulating...if you can teach a cancer something new in a kind/non-condescending way, your halfway there. They are very sensitive so you have to be cautious to their feelings more than you may be accustomed, they prefer being inside than lots of nights on the town and love to shower their mate with affection(mental, physical, emotional) and get the same in return, if this is you...congratulaions:-) they are faithful to the core!|`|2WK2UoPyaa	I like a girl that is faithful but naughty. willing to try new adventures and have fun but doesn't mind just setting at home sometimes. Looks will bring me only so far. I would sacrifice looks and the body for a I'll try any thing you want type of girl (not just sex). Use caution we tend to manipulate those around us, we are very cunning.
t6wmRfoZaa	virgo will verbally destroy cancer  cancer will cry, the go off and get even by poisoning dinner|`|ioZeveazaa	Virgo and Cancer are very good together. Virgo is usually very understanding of Cancer's emotions and this is very good for the relationship. They are good at feeding off each other emotions and supporting one another. Good luck!|`|HZxX9ke8aa	cancer messy, virgo tidy.   cancer instictive and intuitive, virgo rational.   cancer lazy, virgo hardworker.    at least if you are a typical cancer/virgo... and love is blind.|`|wHL0Jw23aa	horoscopes shouldn't matter if it's LOVE than it'll find away =)|`|n53BNB8taa	Yes virgos can be good at fault finding and criticizing but they love cancers.  One or two things can destroy the relationship are jealousy (when cancer wants to spend time with their parents virgo will get jealous)also cancer will get very angry when you insult his parents or his family and will remember it and say it back after many years.   Cancer person can be controlling and if they say hurt words when hurt don't take it seriously.Also don't force your bed room ideas into the cancer in one go, he will go back into his shell and never come back (maybe after 3 or 4 days).  Cancer and virgo relationship will first develop from friendship stage and then lovers stage then goes to the commitment stage (that is good don't rush it).  go to www.cafeastrology.com and you can find out more.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	There are 4 things to look for.  1. If two people form a Grand Trine with each other, no matter what the planets are, they will compliment each others lives.  2. Chiron points the way to your Soul Mate. There are 2 main aspects. Chiron Jupiter and Chiron Neptune. When these planets for a trine, conjunction, parallel or contra-parallel in geocentric or heliocentric charts you are looking at the soul mate aspects.  3. Watch out for dangerous clashes. There are quite a few to look for. The Chiron square Chiron is called the Separate Ways Clash. It is caused by being born about 13 to 18 years apart. Many times people with this aspect will stay together for many years and still end up going their separate ways. A Saturn Juno clash is also very bad. Saturn Chiron is the heartbreak clash. This can be over come and because Chrion rules the family, many times what we see is the source of the heartbreak might be a family member other than the spouse, but many times it comes from the spouse as well.  4. Most astrologers will disagree with this one. Juno doesn't point to marriage. Juno rules the love affair and increases the chance of people becoming intimate but it also rules spells, and as such, fades away with time. It rules marriage without children and children without marriage. But Juno rules the NEED for sex and is the most powerful of the sexual planets.|`|Oc8Dg4gvaa	virgo and cancer make a good couple relationship

0947e3ec7f569b16160b4d118918524baa	I think you are thinking of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will.  It shows Hitler and the Nazi party as the great hope of Germany.      http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025913/    Because of the way it glorifies the Nazi party and Hitler, it is not readily available for purchase, although film studies classes usually end up showing either that film or Olympia (also by Leni Riefenstahl) because she was a woman director at a time when women didn't direct films and she had an innovative and stunning style.

He has lived almost his whole life with his mother, so when a stranger appears one day from a company called "Happy People Ltd." and claims that they can bring his mother back for 1 000$, he doesn't think long before he agrees. But everything doesn't go as it should go. For a while everything is fine and Ed's mother bakes cakes and takes care of him, exactly as before. But then she starts to act more and more strangely. Pealing potatoes in the fridge, repainting the kitchen over night, chasing dogs for meals, jumping over fences and other things that ordinary old mothers usually don't do. And when Rob (who was sent to jail by Ed's mother) appears, things really start to get out of hand.|`|QmOmbprOaa	GOOGLE COACKROACH MOVIES?|`|jH90CtQIaa	cockroaches for momma

Not true.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	The original uncut Japanese version of Grudge.|`|gJBqAXwtaa	the ring  the strangers  dead silence|`|Dr2JjGIfaa	imo, i think the answer wiL vary on what people deem to be scary (gave u a star 4 the q)    imo, i tend to get creeped out more by those films that are based on true stories, ie wolf creek, texas chainsaw.    but heres some of the scariest films ive watched recently    - the omen (damien gives me the creeps!)  - friday 13 part 3 (jason scares me shitless)  - rec (jus for the fact that u r trapped in the building with nowhere to escape, im claustrophobic)  - dead silence (the ventriloquist's doll scares me)  - my bloody valentine 3d (included this because the 3d effects made it more scarier in certain scenes)  - the strangers (only mentioned cos of the ending, which is one of those where u know something is gonna happen, but what actually does happen is unexpected)|`|yfmZDXPTaa	the exorcist scared the crap outta me.  also the amnitinville horror.  the grudge 1 & 2  the ring 1 & 2  final destination 3 (more of a thriller than horror bu still pretty scary)  chucky...|`|DIEih5asaa	Guess who's coming to dinner.|`|aCdya2qkaa	Ringu - the original version of the ring - 10 times scarier then the american version of the ring.

Rec -- They made a remake called Quarantine but I would suggest sticking with the original. Way scarier.    Audition - Creepy and pretty much a more disturbing and slightly horrifying version of Fatal Attraction meets Saw. Oh and its created by Takashi Miike. Yeah he loves his gore.        Last is what I call indie or sun film festival kind of movie. An Australia horror that for me was more gore and disturbing then horror.  But then again I would scream at night still so lets go ahead and call it horror.    Feed - About some sick guy who enjoys watching women eat themselves to death. Very very disturbing.

Vm0v7tRPaa	well i mean its possible but it will take a longer time to manufacture this item. for example the triple threat came first and it took a couple to few years to make it blu ray. and no to the amazon puting it there if they did there is a good chance abusing the movies contract.(i really don't knoe if threre is 1 lol) it will probably take 2-5 years to get through all the seasons in blu ray while it only took 3 years for just dvd. im just glad that its in regular dvd because wat if you went someones house and they don'ty have blu ray you know.  it would be but to me its just a watse of $.|`|Klw3Ke3Haa	Nice link, sure I think there is a chance.|`|hqhxKISfaa	i don't thinks so because that would take a real long time for each episode and that'sis about 900 minutes of footage so the price would be very high and it would be expansive for them to make    but the do make the movies in blu-ray look at these    http://www.walmart.com/search/search-ng....

Xkas9BG2aa	The Beatles broke up in 1970, and John was murdered in 1980, so he had 10 yrs. as a solo artist.  Though when Sean was born in 1975, he spent 5 yrs. as a house dad to Sean...and somewhat retired.  At the time of his death, he and Yoko produced a wonderful album which was called Double Fantasy.  Some great songs off it were....Woman...Starting Over...Beautiful Boy...Watching the Wheels..etc.      He was only 40 yrs. old when he died, so maybe he wasn't consistently producting creative work, but he still was writing songs.  Imagine how many more songs he could have written the last 29 years since his death?!  The music industry lost a great creative talent when John Lennon was killed.  RIP John.|`|ye6IiFr7aa	who john lennon?

They have a diverse background: musician, teacher, architect, firefighter.    They started recording in 2002. They were big on XM-Kids and XM-Disney. Signed a record deal with Disney in 2006. Debuted on Disney channel in 2008. Personally our family loves their music, but not the show.    Personally our family likes their music, but not the show.|`|GYIVGGSOaa	That's weird.

gIjnoEi5aa	I'd like to see Danny Gokey as a finalist because he's a great guy with an awesome voice.  However, I agree with you on Anoop!  I fell in love with his voice during his initial audition when he sang, "Thank You," by Boyz II Men. He has an amazing voice, which is absolutely gorgeous! I also found out that he sang in an all male a cappella (sp?) group for the University of North Carolina and watched clips of the performances on You Tube. After watching those clips it made me want him to succeed even more.  If he doesn't make it to the top 12 I'll throw a fit!|`|QmSIsUZvaa	I like the guy danny i think his name is, the one whos wife passed away and his best friend, the one with pierings on his lips, i like the little black girl Jasmine, meghan the girl with all the tatoos, and the girl with the blonde/pink/black hair who was getting yelled at by the b*tch in the red hair.|`|aihogb26aa	So far I really like Anoop, Danny Gokey, Matt Giraud, and Stevie Wright. The only one I really do not like is Von Smith...he just oversings everything and seems too cocky for me. I also know that there are a lot of singers who have barely gotten any airtime yet...so it is probably way too early to pick favorites and unfair to those who haven't been shown yet.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	I would really love it if Danny Gokey won. I think he's brilliant!|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I don't know his name but they spotlighted him last night after his group's performance.  He has a punk look, dark black shaggy hair.  He was wearing black eyeliner and I can't remember what the group sang all I know is that he sang the H E L L out of that song.  He was the best they showed last night!!    Just found his name Adam Lambert, I think he is one to watch!!|`|l0rKjtUDaa	too early to tell, but Danny and Adam are looking good so far, but some of the girls are not so bad... wait til we get to the top 12.|`|fk9AvB25aa	I usually wait until the top finalists are chosen, so many are cut after Hollywood week.

Usually around 600-700MB.    this is the format you usually get when you record video in digital cameras.    Okay so you got the format down.    Most  .avi movies are called "torrents"...you can use goggle to search for these "torrents".. you would type the name of your movie +torrent" on goggle and look at the results.       First of all get a torrent downloading software. I Recommend Utorrent.    Goggle Utorrent on goggle.      Second, go to Mininova.org  The biggest torrent website would be mininova.org you can get better results if you type the title of the movie .      Third, Also in getting better results, you need to look at the number of SEEDS and LEECHERS. SEEDS are people who have a complete file. and LEECHERS are the ones downloading the file. THe faster the SEEDS and/or LEECHERS the faster your download will be.         And this is extra info if you ever wish to put them on a a DVD, to put them on a DVD    you need to convert .AVI to the dvd format.    there are various converters...I use ConvertXtoDVD . THe conversion process takes like 3-4 hours...you can customize the features as well.|`|d82a3c6d477271a1421807cfc4799764aa	http://www.gotmovies.net    or in .torrent sites (need to download bittorrent) like:    http://www.torrentz.com  http://www.isohunt.com    a list of the 50 best .torrent sites here:    http://www.lednerd.com/2007/05/06/seleca...    (although it is in portuguese you can ignore most of what's written and look directly to the links...)    or hosted in rapidshare:    try out http://rapidlibrary.com to look for rapidshare hosted movies    or in webblogs...    in google write the name of the movie followed by a blog type (example blogspot.com) - the problem is you'll take long because many blogs write movie reviews...    or using programs:    besides bittorrent, where you need to search for the .torrent files on the web, there are other programs like, for example, emule...

nnDor5ehaa	LimeWire or FrostWire, they're both free, but I prefer FrostWire because it takes less memory and has more downloads for people who put music on rather than LimeWire, which has more downloads for people downloading music    So FrostWire has more music on it, and not just rap, but all kinds, and videos, and even porn if you want that, and LimeWire can give you a virus since more people use it. (people try to hack you're computer)    They both are iTunes compatible so you'll have free music for you're iPod (music and videos)    FrostWire also has more speeds on it, Poor - Turbo Charged (6)  LimeWire has less, Poor - Excellent (5)    So I suggest FrostWire rather than LimeWire but they both work fine and I've used both for years.|`|Ur2EFfanaa	You need to try out MP3Lingo.com.

gJhwH335aa	NO, there isn't any Hunter x Hunter anime episodes that continues after Greed Island arc. The OVA stopped on a cliffhanger so you might wanna pick up and continue the series by reading the manga after that.     You can continue the series where episode 92 left off by reading it from Chapter 185. You can either start from page one or just skip it to page 10-11 where the episode 92 left off  http://www.onemanga.com/Hunter_X_Hunter/...    So far there's 290 Chapters for the manga. The series has been plagued with multiple hiatuses. The manga has going for yet another hiatus like a month ago >__    And as far as I know, Togashi already decided that he's going to work on the series to be like this    10 Chapter for the tankobon (manga volume) --- HIATUS (usually lasted for minimum 4 month, maximum 2 year) -- Another 10 Chapter for the tankobon (manga volume) --- Another HIATUS -- And so on...    The anime company won't take a chance on producing anime that didn't have a definite ending because if they do that. They will have to make lots a filler episode to keep the gap between the current chapter and the anime episodes. It will cost more money if they decided to makes Hunter x Hunter anime now.    I must include this. Since this series has been plagued with multiple hiatuses. You will be experiencing some of the bad drawn chapter on online site. However, if you decided to buy the manga volume (like I did), the mangaka has re-drawn and improved the quality of all of the badly drawn chapter for the tankobon (manga volume) version.    You can read the sarcasm article about Hunter x Hunter being one of the 4 manga that kept going for hiatus and also get a little insight on why the series keep going for one hiatus after another here  http://comipress.com/article/2007/02/11/...|`|kOrYXVedaa	Search google.

JXc0O8G9aa	It looks like it's proprietary to Ibanez.  Ibanez doesn't use Floyd Rose or Kahler bridges in any of their guitars.  Especially in their lower end guitars like this.  They have used their own bridge system since the 80's (Edge).  If I remember right, they used to use licensed Floyd Rose bridges but didn't want to pay for the Floyd Rose brand name any more so they developed their own.  I'd imagine they developed this for these guitars since a higher end model would come with an Edge bridge.    Edit:    When you see a bridge referred to as a floating bridge, that just means that it's not a fixed bridge.  Floyd Rose, Edge and Kahlers are all "floating bridges".  It's a type of bridge, not a brand.  In order for a tremolo bridge to work, it can't rest on anything.  It needs to "float".  The "floating" is caused by tension of the strings being equally balanced by the springs pulling the bridge in the other direction (in the body of the guitar).    I'd imagine Fat 10 is just what Ibanez decided to call that particular bridge model and nothing more.

3jFm0rWdaa	Judging by what I hear on the radio lately it's probably an advantage!  But seriously I've wondered about the overreliance on electronic tuners and that the person never really learns to hear pitch.  But if you've been playing guitar for that long and your band hasn't kicked you out I seriously doubt you are really tone deaf.  Practice with your guitar tuning it to a keyboard!!!  That's the best way to improve your ear and tuning abilities.|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	Why not? Just because you need a tuner doesn't mean anything. What do you think most bands do backstage before a show? Theres more people that need a tuner than can tuner by ear.   Besides if your a good enough player does that really matter?|`|ePkiOzPSaa	Well there's a difference between not being able to hear when a note is perfectly in tune and not being able to hear if music sounds good.  Usually, having played a while, you will start to be able to do the former better.  You should try talking to your band about it, if you are completely lacking any confidence.  At this point, though, if they all sound good, you can probably bet that you aren't terrible.  It's completely possible that the others wouldn't tell you, for the sake of being kind, but I would imagine you would know.

"Ba dum ba dum"...yeah I think they didn't add that to the soundtrack cause it was only like 15sec long. Not really worth it to them I guess. What you can do is check the credits. At the end they usually will add them but again hard to see them recognizing a 15 second song.

gDxMoBl9aa	It's good to see that You've taken up the banner for Punk here in R&P Steve, the Genre needs a face around here ever since Dan C has been gone.     Elitism and Narrowmindedness runs rampant against every genre up in here, I am sure Punk is no different and definitely understand where You're coming from.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	Early Police  The Pouges|`|euZRbiA2aa	Rancid i dont rate them a poor mans Clash.It is true apart from a couple of bands proper rebellion punk died in the early 8os.How old are you by the way?Im 40 and remember the old punk bands well.Only genre i really listen to.    EDIT oh well if you like sham 69 your fine by me.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	rancid 100% influenced by the ramones? funny i havent heard the ramones play any reggae.     anyway, i agree somewhat, lots of great unheralded punk bands out there that could use more recognition.|`|W4BvABL6aa	Psycho  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw6Fjo6VX...    It goes back and gets deeper. Maybe their are concerns that the older and possible creators will be forgotten. The convenient shorter sentences, drive the answering society, therefore a negative effect is facilitated.    Most of the time,  you can read those typical answers, without even looking. The worst instances of this happens in the Taylor Swift category.    You will see so much of this in your life. Just try not to hate.    did you like "the sonics"?|`|6jNBKvQGaa	That does bug me a little.  The people that say that aren't serious punk rock fans.  They listen to them because they're famous I guess...but honestly I think the Sex Pistols suck and the Ramones are kind of overrated.  Not that they weren't influential.    I'm not crazy about first wave punk anyway, I'm more into Hardcore and Crust.    Hey Col, if you think punk is dead I have some bands you need to listen to.  Might change your mind.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Yes. People only say things like to make themselves appear all knowing. It is like a person who hates the Beatles but knows "Come Together" yet they think they know everything about the Beatles. Really ridiculous. They only what they want to hear. Some people do not even know Jaco Pastorius or even Andres Segovia.    However, it is hard to fully gain that recognition like The Clash, The Ramones or the New York Dolls simply because they WERE the pioneers of the genre.|`|7qt4aQGYaa	i hate when people suggest a genres most popular band. I asked for classic rock bands and someone asked me if i had ever listened to the beatles or led zepplin.|`|7sqjaYx6aa	i don't mind it. it's true, but you have a point. it's obvious they're great punk bands. people hardly mention black flag, circle jerks, dead Kennedys, misfits, bad religion, the germs etc|`|4LH9RXtuaa	What irritates me are the ones that keep asking "What are some bands that sound like __________ ?"  I like a variety of music, not just bands copying each other.|`|F3QAraMOaa	It only bugs me because, well, it's very likely that the person has already heard of those bands. It's like when people ask on here for some good bands from the 60s and there's 20 answers saying "The Beatles".|`|bPHU2JKaaa	I love Misfits old Danzig crap you know.

I think the reason a lot of people do this is because they want to let the crowd out first.  A lot of people dont like to be in crowds who all are trying to get out, they just are patient and wait until everyone else is out and then they have room to move freely.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	nope

I think it's the girl scout cookies.|`|13fDE4nGaa	Your eating    Quit eating 4 three or 4 days   and you will be on yer way    Good luck|`|YdXhZka8aa	The protein shake is useless calories.  You're already getting plenty from the sausage and girl scout cookies.|`|RP5NnxgUaa	This is what you should do:  Breakfast: Whole wheat english muffin with peanut butter on it. You get your whole grains and protien that will keep you full until mid morning. Protein helps you burn calories.  Mid-morning snack: A cup of fruit or a 100 calorie pack.  Lunch: A low fat healthy lunch meat on whole wheat bread with salad.  Mid-day snack: Sugar snap peas, or some kind of vegetable like that,  Dinner: Anything low fat with chicken.   Dessert: An apple    4-5 days a week at the gym: 30 minutes of cardio and 12 reps on each machine.     Good luck!|`|SJwRbuBHaa	ehh, let me see,,the package says "smoke sausage" thats it !   you don't eat them, you smoke them.|`|f8d37f51816f93a01c3756a4f407dca2aa	You need more sausage hun.

Klw3Ke3Haa	I probably wouldn't pay much of anything for it because comics hardly even interest me, but you can try sites like ebay, amazon, buy.com, or go to a comic convention to find customers willing to make a reasonable purchase price. Or use the power of google to find plenty of useful and helpful sites for you to use. Good Luck!|`|hzH75VDXaa	At most 50 and I doubt anyone would pay that much.    The comic itself is one that you can find at any comic shop that sells back issues for 4 bucks.    The autographs, well if the person  is  fan of that artist or writing they may be willing to pay a little more, but neither of them are that popular.    If you had something autographed by Alan Moore or Peter David, it would be a different story.

I just lowered my head until I made eye contact with him and i was like "WTF...stop looking at my boobs idiot". Only b/c he was a guy friend and I didn't think of him as a guy (if that makes sense).|`|NQYnmxELaa	I love boobs and will look at them as long as I have eyes and women have breast!|`|3uz3DMJgaa	HAHAHAHA.  i dont care if the chicks looking at  me while i stare at her ***/boobs.  it just means i think shes sexyyyyy.|`|ydR5Lm7Naa	I LOVE WHITE GIRLS    I NEED ME SOME WHITE MEAT    WHITE GALS NEED SOME DARK MEAT LIKE ME!!!!|`|WKcJE9bKaa	I don't have that problem since I don't have cleavage :-)      Why should they really have to be "sneaky"? the reason women show cleavage in the first place is to have men look at it if i'm not mistaken.    I guess complaining about it is half the fun for alot of women.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	then stop showing it...    would be the same thing if i pulled my mr woopy out and walked around in public and when girls look i'd be like "gurl plzz what chu lookin at... you gotsa be mindin ya bizness dats all"|`|uQUqZ7k5aa	am i sorry did you say something, i was staring at your cleavage|`|nceIGfCBaa	Do you really think we men do not notice you noticing us noticing then try to cover up said cleavage?

I love boobies and theirs nothin you can do about it.|`|8CUfDxRtaa	I really don't care if women notice it or not...I even let out a compliment or two to some women...such as "nice presentation".    now if you'd kindly show me your presentation I will get back to work.|`|EiB6GNxlaa	Boobs have gravity...    As a guy, I actually prefer small ones... but does that stop me from looking at big ones?? NOPE.. we try, but it is nearly impossible to just not look..  and to make it worst they make us stupid ... suddenly we cannot count change, walk without tripping, or say a complete sentence without stumbling over our words... kryptonite..|`|iIWWeD7Taa	We know you catch us but we cant help it.  If you dont like it, hide 'em.  Until then, I will continue to peer at your breastseseseses|`|mwv79AIhaa	nope, sometimes we want u to know that we admire the hard work u put into urself..would u rather have a lot of guys looking, or them turning theyre heads the opposite way when u walk by?|`|rCX9gQUvaa	I just take their head and throw down there and make them do the motor boat sound..

I love it when guys get caught staring at boobies when they are my boobies I make them blush for it.

A lot of actors are always the same character just in a different movie. Like Hugh Grant is always Hugh Grant...    My favourite Johnny Depp movie is Chocolat.   I also like him in Secret Window, and  Pirates.|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	edward scissorhands was awesome, but i like the pirates trilogy, hes flippin hilarious in them, and sexy. :)|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	Edward Scissorhands  Sweeney Todd  What's Eating Gilbert Grape|`|rcRoF7WNaa	Oooh, Blow was good, but I'd have to say Ed Wood.    Then Donny Brasco.|`|FUNsFQEtaa	i love johnny depp in many movies and i think he was able to portray just about all of the characters with great accuracy...  my favorites (and i mostly liked the entire movies because of him):    Finding Neverland  Sweeney Todd  Pirates of the Caribbean 1,2,3  Edward Scissorhands  Sleepy Hollow  and What's Eating Gilbert Grape    my sis thinks he never gets mad at any movie even if it was an action movie like say: nick of time, that's supposed to be an action movie and i nearly never saw him show an ounce of anger!  he's a very talented actor i really appreciate his work|`|aZ5nW8VIaa	1.

6U9b2t4raa	Awesome!!  Is there anything you could not look sexy in? Doubt it.      But I do regret to tell you the Snuggie is not all fun and games. Like I told our friend Serabi earlier, it can be either a warm fuzzy friend, or an instrument of evil.      Like the ad states, they are great for sporting events. Wrong!! I wore my red one to the Worcester Sharks hockey game, and was beaten almost to a bloody pulp. One guy got behind me, and pulled on it so tight, I could not raise my arms to throw a punch.   B-  One size DOES not fit all!! My seven year old was wearing mine, tripped over the excess 4 feet, hit his head on the table. Snap..10 stitches.   3- While attempting to throw a log on the fire, the long droopy sleeves caught fire. Luckily I was drinking beer at the time and dowsed the flames.   D-   it is very hard to pee with this thing on...one, there is no flap in the front, so it has to be raised up and over or removed. More than once , my Snuggie has been submerged in toilet water.      Buyer Beware!!!!!|`|PVMsr2Faaa	Haven't learned how to work a blanket yet?|`|TEhITkeIaa	And I would love to see that picture my dear.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	I always see the commercial and think they're ridiculous but I honestly would not mind having one.|`|0GkhVzh5aa	Nope I have to suffer in my blanket where my arms are constantly trapped... lol|`|Mu3UvybKaa	Yes, I see what your saying. Although, a robe may be just as effective|`|dC1wU8n4aa	huh? no|`|OzslGLjAaa	I think they look like wizard robes. You could glue some felt stars on it, and pose for the cover of fantasia.|`|uXpmw4Giaa	I agree with nita r  I always tell my friends that if we started a cult  I would buy snuggies for everyone!  but yes it also could be a hospital gown  and it would probably be very comfertable too|`|39uYZ4nsaa	Good for you!|`|vlFVdcxOaa	like lord voltarmore. lol! SSSCCCAAARRRRYYYYY! AND SOFT!|`|0CET3S3daa	I always love my time in a hospital gown......   though it's "hard" to hide...|`|7vk4xoKZaa	haha yes. I want one so bad. Just the name makes me giggle. SNUGGIE!!!!|`|fHxpycJSaa	I only wear mine to outdoor sporting events, like the weirdos on the commercial.|`|9BB5H7aJaa	that is very cool.  unfortunately snuggies have not yet made it overseas  and I just have to cuddle in a hospital gown=,(|`|snUDfcfgaa	Yes.  In my cult that its name is still to be determined, we wear our snuggies naked.  It's good for quick and easy access on Orgy night.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Its like an open back moomoo|`|Vhq3GURQaa	While we are busy mocking it the 'inventor' of the snuggie is cashing those big checks.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	they remind me of a cult robe.|`|AA10916001	If you get one in red, you would look just like a Rajneeshee.    http://hem.passagen.se/jan.olofsson/biow...|`|nBGjPwViaa	The commercial looks like a coven of witches got together for the evening.|`|9eBruYtqaa	just use a blanket. those things look like the robes they had to wear in judgement city in the movie "defending your life"|`|ba4R1tf1aa	If that's a new pet name for Ted, then YUK! NO! NEVER!    *yer sic!*|`|rPywKtJRaa	Hospital gown, over-sized straight jacket whatever.  I think if you feel the breeze then you should return your snuggie.|`|qdPtCBJeaa	No not tso much a hospital gown but more like a Saints Robe.....I think I would feel........mmmm .....holier than thou?  giggles
56dfvnwmaa	not sure. I think I know who you mean. Her name is Joanna Pacitti or something like that.    I dont know what happened to her|`|4JQ71C1caa	Yes! Joanna Pacitti - I loved her too! And when I was watching American Idol this week, I hadn't seen her at all. I'm also wondering what happened to her.|`|9X0nHkdWaa	OMG I love her too!

I don't know if she made it or not.  She was probably not very dramatic (TV worthy) so they didn't feature her.  I hope she is still in!|`|1e1c46a239b656a18912bf09414d22c5aa	the unofficial list of this season's final 36 contestants has been leaked  and she is on the list|`|CCYWYk3qaa	Yeah I agree with you! I liked Joanna's voice. Yes we all know she's been a record label before..but i myself have been looking for her and have not see her at all on any one of these Hollywood week days. I've been wondering that myself. If anyone has any answers please let us know! I"m curious myself! Maybe b/c she's had 'star fame' b4 as a kid and has had a bg of singing w/ a label..maybe they decided to only show ppl on TV who've never had that kind of background b4. They'll probably show her once it gets down to the top 36 if she just so happens to be on there.    I found this link.....check it out    http://video.aol.com/video-detail/joanna...

lEPN80gWaa	surely, this isnt something that youre going to want to here, but hell, ill voice it anyways. parties that tended to be fun when i was younger were high school parties. the usual, people drinking, maybe a local band, normal debauchery and usually an unhappy house owner. something you probably wont want at your house. a mini road trip of sorts with a few friends brought along would take off better, most likely.
h1IYS0dbaa	Bonnie & Clyde    Urban Cowboy is a bad movie.|`|VSWl45cKaa	One is more a romantic comedy and the other is an historical (but violent) interpretation.

Ui8DcdmMaa	To be honest, I don't know anyone who would claim that Astrology is a science - except if they are completely without knowledge of Astrology.      Science is a  very small subset of the 'truth' that which our brain can understand and 'formulate' scientifically.|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello    From memory Astrology is classed as a science due to its strong mathematical nature.    Sadhara|`|3WItFAwlaa	The same reason many people think that it is a religion.    Because they don't know any better.    "Points of light" have nothing to do with it.  But that was CUTE.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	I read the website that you're posting her. It's kinda funny because I know that that is not what Astrology is about. The site is right in thinking that the planets are too far away to have influence on us. I know that this is impossible. But think about this; The Babylonians took notes on what was happening in the sky and what was happening on Earth for hundreds of years and they noticed that when there were certain patterns that certain things would happen. It had nothing to do with the shapes that the planets were making, but perhaps the planets were showing us what was happening if we could only read the signs. This is what Astrology is about. It's about reading the signs in the sky. Not some make believe fact that the planets have influence over us.    Most Astrology has not taken on the task of trying to prove itself. The only school that has so far is the Magi Society. This is the astrology that I study. And we know that we don't know everything there is to know about astrology but at least we are dealing with a fuller set of planets than the early Babylonians and the symbolism is based on research that has to be repeated every time or it's discarded. It's done using scientific method.     So go ahead and think that it is all superstition. It just proves how ignorant you are. This is funny because you think a lot and still can't see the truth. It's really funny that you can't see all the order in the universe either which is the main proof that the universe was created by a much higher intelligence than we have the potential for. Still I have respect for skeptics because I do see a lot of what you are saying and how most people don't really try to find the truth by individual investigation. In this way I'm glad you are still thinking.    Until I found the Magi Society, I was ready to give up on astrology because it was wrong over 50% of the time.|`|2VNmxfgpaa	I did read the site, I have the gist of the arguments.  I will not rebut those arguments at all.      Relating to astrology is a bit like relating to Tarot cards.  No scientific proof or measurable effects.  The symbols of planets, signs, etc and the symbols in Tarot and Qabbalah have Universal Applicability and spawn real, applicable insight into human nature and relationships by identifying universal traits and relative relationships to other traits.    I am well-versed in classical astrology and tarot.  The applicability goes only so far in providing counsel and insight.  It is no substitute at all for critical thinking, reasoning, common sense.  Rather, these are means to gain insight to mysterious situations, moving back toward logical action is the whole point.  The mind needs to start somewhere when stuck, universal symbols are ideal.    That's not even why astrology is known as a science.  That is only because complex mathematics and precise calculations are needed for astrology.  "Science" is not correct by any means.  Applied math would be more accurate.    That being said, astrology can be uncanny.  Life can be uncanny, even if you're an atheist.  Life has an uncanny way of throwing at you what you need.  If you want to categorize Astrology, call it "Psychology with Syncronicity".

Usually, people who are weak and/or have low self-esteem are more likely to cheat than other people with stronger more grounded morals.|`|Amkmles0aa	women chat more|`|jaAolejUaa	well, the population ratio does state that there are 10 women to 1 men. so if we think about it there are more women to every men. plus some of these men become priest and others are gay. there would be less men for the women then. so how can women cheat if there are limited men. in men's case there are more women available for them. so men cheat more than women do.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	The last article I read said it is about the same.    Research used to say that men cheated more, but that was because of problems with the research sometimes.  Men who don't cheat may feel like it's bragging if they say they do, so they lied.

And the silly chesnut that if men are cheating, there must be women to match, is wrong because there are men on the down low who are bi sexual and do other men, plus prostitution is mainly geared to men.  There are very few women who get prostitutes as male prostitutes are geared for bi/gay men.     They did this study and men are 60/40 to women.  Men cheat just to get as much as they can, women cheat for emotional reasons.  More women cheat nowadays because they have their own incomes and are not tied to the home but still not in the numbers that men do.    I had many a conversation with a particular married man who was trying to get me, a married woman to cheat with him.  He told me it was harmless fun and he had done it hundreds of times with coworkers.  He drove a van for that express purpose so he could go to a nearby park for a nooner quickie .  He set up Tuesday night as his night to go out and cat around, telling his wife he played hockey at the rink.  He deliberately flirted with women from other company facilities so he could arrange to meet them at their hotels when they came to town.  He also liked to hit on any interns or contractors we had too, because they were only going to be around for a few months so he would befriend them and take them under his wing in order to get in their pants.    I asked him why he needed all of this, what his marriage was missing and he said it was just because he wanted MORE and wondered what other women were like.|`|UVciAbXxaa	idk i know a lot of both genders that cheat an that been cheated on but with my experience imma go with women since ive been cheated on twice|`|EJ3oiAo5aa	50/50!|`|PMYhY7tMaa	Women cheat more than men for sure|`|wUkU3HVwaa	i'd say that women cheat on men more with things like snogging and kissing people when out clubbing and such like.  whereas men like to take it that extra bit further  bstrds haha  xxx|`|BAhmIXiKaa	women cheat more|`|TerZs0dTaa	Men cheat more, fact.|`|4WttCv0paa	I'd think men do|`|8lzBktaeaa	nowadays, women are thinking like men , it goes both ways|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	Men cheat more.

Men and woman generally cheat for various reasons. To say who cheats more would be more of a guess, even though there are basic statistics out there suggesting that men cheat more than woman, this does not mean that it is fact. In-fact, today, cheating woman is just as common as cheating men.    The main reasons why men generally cheat on their spouse relates to sex. Quite commonly there is a sex problem within the relationship. Whereas a woman generally cheats as a last resort when all her complaints are left unheard, as a last resort a woman may cheat, but it will generally be for emotional reasons rather than for sexual reasons.    If a man continues to show no respect for the woman, continues to ignore her, and gives her no emotional support, some woman may look elsewhere to have their need fulfilled. A man, however, is generally a more simple being. Thats not to say some men arent deep and emotional, however, generally speaking, a man will cheat when he feels his need for sex is not being fulfilled, or, he has spoken to his partner about this and has got not no respectful response.    Most of the reasons cheating woman become unfaithful are reasons that could be easily rectified by a husband who is willing to make the effort and put in some extra work within the relationship. For this reason, we believe that most affairs relating woman cheating on men are preventable.    Cheating men may also be preventable by greater communication and in a mutual agreement where a mans needs can in-fact be met. Some kind of mutual agreement that benefits both in the relationship is always the best bet.    To be honest, cheating is for kids who havent grown up. We recently read a an interesting report that stated, men and woman who are more likely to cheat are those who have been spoilt rotten since kids, have never had to cope with any major stress as partners have always bailed them out, have never dealt with any hard times, have always had everything done for them, and people who like to have their own way. In other words, grown ups with self-respect, self worth, and respect for their partners will generally do whatever they can to make the relationship work.    We believe that if you choose to have a relationship with someone, then you should both love each other before you make the commitment. A relationship is about trust, loyalty, commitment and a lifelong quest of fulfilling each others needs. When you love someone, you live not only with him or her, but also for him or her. There happiness is yours, and there misery is yours, you take the good with the bad, gradually trying to improve the good, whilst overcoming thrown obstacles along the way. With the support and love from each other, there is nothing you both cannot accomplish as a team.    Do you think your spouse may be cheating on you?

QWaspeg7aa	I couldn't narrow it down to one, but I would have to say All About Eve is an amazing film- Bette Davis is just fantastic in it. Brokeback Mountain is brilliant too- I'm a huge Annie Proulx fan and read the novella first and I really didn't think Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger could do justice to Ennis and Jack but they so do, especially Heath Ledger, Annie Proulx herself said she fell back in love with the characters once she'd seen the film. Ang Lee's direction is beautiful. Other than that, How to Marry a Millonaire which I think is really the birth of the chick flick, Vertigo for obvious reasons, The Shawshank Redemption because Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are both so believable and the whole film is structured so well- there isn't an unnecessary scene in it and the casting is superb. Also for the scene with Brooks (I won't tell you incase you haven't seen it) but if you're not sure about this film it's worth it for that scene alone. Oh, and Monster- Chalize Theron deserved about 50 Oscars for how she played Aileen Wuornos, I've never watched such an unnerving performance in my life, she's just utterly captivating. Withnail and I is outstanding too- there are so many incredible characters and actors in that and I think the pacing of the whole thing is so good. Uncle Monty is possibly my favourite film character ever. Badlands I love- the soundtrack and locations are so atmospheric.  Cinema Paradiso I love, it's a real cup-of-tea-on-a-rainy-afternoon film. It's hard to fault Taxi Driver, Midnight Cowboy, Goodfellas, The Godfather trilogy, and Stand By Me.  Amelie is great too for the fairytaleness of it all, as well as Edward Scissorhands and I suppose you could put Dirty Dancing in there too- it's not a perfect movie by any means, but if by perfect movie you mean something you enjoy everytime you see it then it would be.   There are some films that are imperfect but are kind of perfect because of that, like Buffalo 66, which wouldn't be everyone's choice but Christina Ricci and Vincent Gallo are just so good. Angelica Houston is weirdly captivating and the storyline just keeps you watching from beginning to end. Also in that category is Rainman- I find Tom Cruise seems to be playing himself somehow although not having Tom on my Facebook means I have to go off how he comes across in the media.   There are also some films that I feel mean leaving out so I'm just going to list them- Thelma and Louise, The King of Comedy, To Have and Have Not, My Own Private Idaho, Barton Fink, Fargo, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Cape Fear (original and remake, I can't decide between them), The Lost Boys, Forrest Gump, Apocalypse Now, Good Morning Vietnam, The Matrix (probably just the first one though to be honest), Lord of the Rings (trilogy), Scum, Scrubbers, Sexy Beast (esp Ben Kingsley in this), Reservoir Dogs, O Brother Where Art Thou, The Big Lebowski (I am a Cohen Brothers fan but I'm not sure I'd put everything on this list), This is England, Dead Man's Shoes...  There's probably loads more I could list but I'm going off the point of your question now anyway!    Oh God, I forgot Requiem for a Dream. Watch it, it's amazing. Ellen Burstyn will blow you away. Probably not one to watch with your parents in the room though but the fact that it is graphic makes it so good- if Darren Aronofsky had left that stuff out or even just toned it down it wouldn't have the same quality at all.    I also forgot Walter. You will cry your eyes out if you watch this, I've never seen anything so tragic in my whole life. Ian McKellan is just brilliant. It's one of those films that's really influenced how British film is made today and I really recommend it.|`|W5h7UfZmaa	The god father 1 2 3|`|alpymXfCaa	People are going to think I'm insane (because of Elephant being mentioned).

Elephant  The Royal Tenenbaums  Good Bye Lenin!  Strictly Ballroom  The Sting  The Never Ending Story  The Fox and the Hound  C.R.A.Z.Y.|`|Rnkewtiuaa	Batman: Dark Knight!

Leda2ha0aa	Once again he took the easy road (last time he picked the "girl" vegetarian chef who he thought he could beat - but didn't) and this time he picked the easiest meal all of them would have been able to prepare.    I agree that Carla was able to figure out a more complexed meal so she should have gotten higher marks, but Stefan's was supposedly spot on and so that is why he won.    I just love the French Chef, Eric Ripert.  He seems so shy and humble when talking to the people.  It was nice to see him getting a compliment from Toby, the other judge, and then saying "a compliment coming from someone like you"... it was nice to see there are some people who are so talented who don't have huge egos.  I like watching every time he is on.|`|e4259abb4e5d0ea5a734423f5be756f9aa	***Without even tasting the dishes I firmly believe Carla should of won.  Tom is Stephan's biggest fan though so he has that going for him.  ***I am officially in love w/Chef Eric.  He is such an awesome chef and seems so nice (unlike that Italian chef last week).  I think he wanted to give it to Carla.      As long as Hosea and Leah aren't in the final 2 I won't freak out but this may be my last season watching.|`|ciXSjbCiaa	I totally agree. I was so disappointed Stephan won. I thought she did an excellent job and had a much tougher dish! I thought he got the win because as you said, it was more fitting to him.     I can't believe that Hosea wasn't sent home for his mistake w fish, his expertise.|`|9X0nHkdWaa	have you ever watched hell's kitchen?! I think that guy is a nazi O.o!!!  oh no the nightmares are coming back|`|b7d3fe1e0770cd80916e81d846475327aa	I agree with you.  Stefan picked a pretty easy dish - baked lobster with hollendaise is not very complex, flavor-wise  - and Carla's was more difficult.  I don't even know what that fish was she made!  She deserved to win.  I'm more annoyed that they keep Leah on the show!  She's made two inedible dishes almost in a row but she stays and Jeff and Jaime go?|`|3L9bRmOqaa	I think Carla did get robbed of another win.  But, she is a humble person so I am sure she was grateful to be on the top and not with the other 3 who were on the bottom.

rnqgiRkWaa	in a relationship we love DEEP.  we NEED to feel wanted and appreciated and sexy!    the question is what have you done for me lately, what can i do for you today    we are generous, FUNNY! jealous.   some feel the need to control more then others but for the most part we all want a sense of control!     we need to leave our stubborn attitudes behind, cuz we arent ALWAYS righ (most of the time we are right thuogh lol)    we are very very loyal UNTIL we get screwed over then its anyones game!    if you lie to us, we will lie to you. because our egos dont want to be made a fool of    we are very passionate and like to spoil!     we just want someone to be loyal loving and there for us. who has good communication      we need to learn to give as much as we take and realize that we arnt the center of the relationship all the time.   we need to stop feeling like we have to control everything around us and not to get so jealous =]  we need space and not someone to smother us.|`|aOBmcGAZaa	I think they are like any other female. There's no difference in how you are based on how the stars were aligned at the time of your birth.    http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/ast...|`|LrKCLZF7aa	There are 4 things to look for.  1. If two people form a Grand Trine with each other, no matter what the planets are, they will compliment each others lives.  2. Chiron points the way to your Soul Mate. There are 2 main aspects. Chiron Jupiter and Chiron Neptune. When these planets for a trine, conjunction, parallel or contra-parallel in geocentric or heliocentric charts you are looking at the soul mate aspects.  3. Watch out for dangerous clashes. There are quite a few to look for. The Chiron square Chiron is called the Separate Ways Clash. It is caused by being born about 13 to 18 years apart. Many times people with this aspect will stay together for many years and still end up going their separate ways. A Saturn Juno clash is also very bad. Saturn Chiron is the heartbreak clash. This can be over come and because Chrion rules the family, many times what we see is the source of the heartbreak might be a family member other than the spouse, but many times it comes from the spouse as well.  4. Most astrologers will disagree with this one. Juno doesn't point to marriage. Juno rules the love affair and increases the chance of people becoming intimate but it also rules spells, and as such, fades away with time. It rules marriage without children and children without marriage. But Juno rules the NEED for sex and is the most powerful of the sexual planets.
FF4nWQmqaa	The woman was hired from the ceo of the of the bank to protect his personal belongings that was in a safe in the bank. He hired her when he found out that the bank was being robbed.    The ceo worked with the nazis in his pass and the stuff that connected him to the nazis was in the safe.He didnt want everyone to know about it so thats why he hired the women to get it before the people who robbed the bank do.    The ring that danzel had was a Cartier ring, belonging to a Jewish friend who he allowed to die at the hands of the Nazis in exchange for money.    The robbers did take all the daimonds that was in the safe. The diamonds were worth ALOT of money somewhere in the billions.    The robber  gave denzel the diamond at the end because when danzel came into the bank and was talking to the robber danzel said that he had a girlfriend but wast married. The robber asked why and danzel said because he couldnt afford a diamond ring. So the robber helped him out without danzel even knowing it by give the ring.    At the end the robber came out his hiding spot and walked straingt out the bank. While walking out he bumped into Denzel who didnt notice who he was and dropped the diamond in his pocket.

iWXQH1Jeaa	Light until he started killing innocents. Near just sucks.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	L, Light is a bit crazy and Near is just...well have you seen him?|`|ucswpeSKaa	while i was watching it i was cheering for light the entire time.. i loved L, he was an amaaazing charrie, but i just totally can relate to how light felt and i understand how he was. he had such a good idead, and plan for the world.. he just wanted people to be honest and for no one to commit crimes, he wanted the world to be a better place.. i agree with that.: "this world is rotting, and those who are making it rot deserve to die".. he DID go a bit overboard with wanting to be God, but i was on his side.. =]  RIP Kira!!    =]|`|6PSnZDhDaa	[seigi no mikata] I'm on L's side.... though I understand Light a little bit... Near ticks me off... Mello's cool|`|e8o2eP6Zaa	Light. I agree with his intentions to cleanse the world. I think criminals deserve the death penalty. Though Light sacrificed some innocent people along the way, I believe sacrifice is required sometimes to achieve better things in future.    But for him to think he IS God is too much =)|`|dwu1b36xaa	L, Mello, and Near.  because the characters are just damn cool  plus they have MATT! .. i know he was only in there for like 30 seconds but come on HES AWESOME!|`|ETVr1PdRaa	LIGHT! I can totally relate to his character! :)    I was hardcore L until the offed him, and the had Near take over, and then I was like... Grr! And switch the Light. I'm still a total L fangirl, though.|`|LtSn8mXXaa	I guess I'm on L, Mello, and Near's side. At first I was all for Light, but then I started to like L so I guess I was for both of them :3 But then Light killed L so I completely switched sides I guess :P But I also don't like how Light is killing people and everything. The way he tricked L (Well, sorta, I guess :P) was cruel, and it made me mad. I don't like the way how he didn't care about anyone at all. Well, I guess that's what power does to someone.  Oh, and I don't like Near for some reason. I don't know why, it's just that, I don't like him :P Odd, but okay|`|ARRsp216aa	I actually found myself rooting for Kira. What bothered me was that L could figure things out too easily for my taste. He could somehow just jump to conclusions. I felt the same way about Near. I think part of me wanted Light to win just to see what his idea of the world would have been like.|`|4pDDWVdwaa	L ftw!  ^_^ light almost has no personality and only a dream that was his..'driving force that creates you' .. he had nothing but a goal and a manuplitave mind set so.. i didnt really like him much. and he killed L TT_TT   as for near and mello, well.. i didnt really have much of an opinion of them to be honest.. cause after L died, things went by really slowly, but in the end it revived a little.   i loved and pity'd Teru Mikami though >    www.ZeroGrapeJuice.deviantart.com|`|Jz4QuEgTaa	Light.  Why?  Our Mind's Think Alike.|`|5OwJz5V4aa	i love L...i totally support him...that goes with the rest of his team...(mello, near, etc.)|`|pTERJdzQaa	Ryuzaki L!!!!! NO CONEST!!!!!    Eery member of the Kira task force were all really cool, and they werent trying to rid the world of other humans, they were the ones that actually had the sense to try and stop Kira.    I really hate Light Yagami, Anyone who would try to kill of waves of people for no particular reason is not great, Light has to be the most overrated char. in the series, besides L is alot more cooler and smarter than Light, and also Near(N) was really cool, and he made an awesome replacement for Ryuzaki.|`|IlsDo8jqaa	I was on Raitos/Lights side at first because he was killing people and I found it funny that you could kill someone with a notebook. Now I'm on L's side though because I though about what it would be like if were real and I believe humans don't have the right to take another creatures life weather it is an ant or a human.    I think B's cool too. XD|`|fvwPCW3kaa	When I started out I loved light but now (like you) I love L.   And I absolutely hate near he annoys me so much. Mello just rawks ~    =]|`|6EocUFbhaa	In the beginning I thought that Light was suppose to be the good but then time progressed and you saw that he is just pure evil and is very hypocritical. He fights fire with fire and always gets a bigger flame. I think most people leaned towards him at first then once he became all crazy with power it scared you to a point where you liked L better. Light kind of reminds me of Sweeny Todd because all they want to do is to rid evil from the world but they do it in the wrong way.

I believe, people in India try to see sentiments and emotions with tears . any movie made like that get huge money .

They make amazing songs and have great voices. The Sugababes however, make crap songs which aren't catchy. They've had really bad CD sales since Mutya left, they're going down the pan - it's not an opinion it's a fact! Girls Aloud don't slate off other bands, which is what The Sugababes have recently done. Oh, and Girls Aloud have had 20 consecutive top 10 hits - more than any other female group. Girls Aloud are NOT desperate for attention... came to that conclusion by reading magazines have you? Get a grip and stop judging them by what they look like. Oh, and Girls Aloud haven't had a member change over stupid bitchy arguments within the band.

qThmcR1Aaa	I've been a Floyd fan for ages ... they're probably my second favorite band.    "Meddle" is my favorite. It's a big transition album for them ... there's a little bit of their early experimental style in there, but they're also figuring out how to write gorgeous melodies and catchy songs. Plus, David Gilmour starts to discover his signature guitar style. It took them four years to find a direction after Syd Barrett flaked out, and they finally found it. When you listen to "Meddle," you virtually hear the blueprint for "Dark Side of the Moon." Great stuff.    "Echoes," to me, is the greatest thing Floyd ever did. But yeah, there's plenty of other good music on there. "One of These Days" is a big galloping instrumental rocker. "A Pillow of Winds" and "Fearless" are gorgeous slow acoustic pieces, "San Tropez" is a nice little tropical tune, and "Seamus" is hilarious -- a little blues song with a dog howling along with the music.    There's a little bit of everything. Excellent album!|`|2PFn8k4jaa	Animals, but my favorite ususally changes every now and then..|`|LwqM7EHVaa	i'm stuck between dark side of the moon and animals..|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Dark side of the moon|`|TZMJTtnkaa	meddle is definitely my favorite the first songs are great and yeah echoes is epic|`|ObeBvtzgaa	The Wall, at the moment.  Haven't heard Meddle really.|`|AA10529198	Me... I still say "The Wall"|`|UadhKe8xaa	The Wall or Dark Side of the Moon.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here  Favorite song, favorite album!|`|AA11615514	Wish You Were Here is better than Animals (IMHO)  Meddle is a good album too  Dark Side of the Moon is really good|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	"Dark Side of the Moon" :)|`|7fEVNng5aa	Animals for me.    Give Meddle a few more listens. It's a fantastic album. Echoes is an excellent song, but so is One of These Days and Fearless.|`|9RTuRPviaa	Wish You Were Here is probably my favorite. I listen to Dark Side of the Moon the most though.    Meddle is really good. I'd give it another try. Try listening to One of These Days on a really good stereo system (not like an ipod), it'll blow you away.

y9TipQ7Daa	I don't think they are going to change the mascot. I think they are just trying to make people relate to him more on a personal level. It's funny, because he is so obviously different than we are - yet he does all of these things that are the same things we do. It's good advertising, I think. I love the Jack-in-the-Box commercials. Jack is hilarious.

My guy is 6'5 and 250 pounds. But other than that I guess I wouldn't really care since all is well in the bedroom....|`|YZkj6HOUaa	My nieces once made up my hubby with the whole dress, makeup, nail polish and everything and he didn't look that bad. He didn't look like a female either though.    Rather than being embarrassed to be seen in public with him, I think it would be fun to watch other people react. And at least if he was out alone, I wouldn't have to worry about him sleeping around.    So I think I could adjust. Except he'd probably have nicer clothes than me with my T-shirt and jeans all the time.    PS. Is this a test question for your own use? ;)|`|vxEDtriRaa	Shopping!!! Woo Wee!!|`|RP5NnxgUaa	Hmm... that's a tough question. Have you heard that Christmas song "Walking in a Winter Wonderland"? Well there's a song that guys sing that's called "Walking around in Woman's Underwear" and it's really funny. I guess it would have to depend on whether he goes out or not. If he just does it in privacy, I wouldn't judge, but if he goes out clubbing like that and hooks up with other cross dressers, than I would have a problem with it.

Turkey is packed full of protein for guys that pump iron life myself.|`|WXAoSr49aa	dont really like any of them but ham please i dont eat turkey|`|NB5Dr7Nzaa	Ya know, I don't really care that much for Turkey.  I hate it sliced at the deli for some reason, but I will eat it if it's straight off the bird.  Love me a turkey sandwich after Thanksgiving with A1 sauce.  Mmmm.  But honestly my all time favorite is Ham and Swiss.  With a touch of mayonnaise and a little more than a touch of mustard with a tomato and lettuce.  Simple perfection.  And I really love a smoked ham.|`|EJ3oiAo5aa	Turkey is better!|`|klhFMdCgaa	turkey.

At home, it depends on which holiday we just had. I like sandwiches from both, I make my own sandwich, so I can trim those little hard gristle parts out. Other people dont always seem to mind leaving them in there.|`|cT3BLcukaa	OMG I HAVE THAT PROBLEM ALL THE TIME at my dads house thats all they eat is ham and i am a total turkey person and that little hard chunk you are talking about makes me cringe its horrible i HATE HAM    and plus turkeys are gross pigs are at least a little cuter than a pig lol

yJd1WwF2aa	Yes I LOVED her! She had a real older touch to her voice it reminded more of Carly Simon and she had the coolest personality ever! I was mad at bikini girl, it was her fault Rose got out. I really hope Rose comes back next year, i really liked her :)|`|bpyx92GZaa	I liked her alot, she was different and a cute young lady too. Some of those people should have been kicked off like that guy with the piercing near his lips and such a cry baby and he is so GAY too.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well she was great.  I will only star because roses are red and I love flowers.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	I liked her.|`|iYoCZVpmaa	I don't know,  and i don't care.|`|fQghpx3Zaa	Ugh. I couldn't stand her. Her voice sucked too.|`|ecNeN0staa	I did, she was great.|`|l0rKjtUDaa	I really did.  She was different and I was anxious to she how she might develope..  it was sad.|`|CL5Plgekaa	I think she had a unique talent. She could have gone further with the correct material.|`|75354f898ff7737b3aacdf85ed7acf69aa	i did like her. hard to believe she was only 17. She seems like an "old soul" for some reason. I would love to see some movie studio snatch her up and out her in some kooky film.|`|KmC0K59taa	I did like her.  Her voice wasn't outstanding, but neither was Brooke White's and she made it really far last season.  I think she lacked confidence and that didn't help her any.  Her group sucked (she got stuck with Bikini Girl!) and she set herself up for failure mentally.|`|eI5rgLcraa	she was alright      she could have not screwed up even though she was pissed at bikini bimbo.    she let katrina get the best of her, and then didn't perform well|`|RAzV6v5Aaa	i liked her alot!!  its a shame she got cut.  i think they made the wrong desition.  i starred the question btw, i also give rose a star 4 tryin.
BiOEG91faa	Schmitt Music artist------------Pat Green    ET|`|a045515e54b0474a7e28840819491423aa	Yeah, I couldn't find it on the website, either.  But they tell you on WAXX during their special radio show sponsored by Schmitt Music.  It's on every Saturday at 8am and 8pm.  The answer for this past weekend's Artist of the Week is Pat Green...
kBSlNEL2aa	STOP! right now, don't be dumb...Nothing and I mean Nothing in your life is EVER bad enough to cut yourself over...remember that.  Wish I lived near you because I would come save you, then beat your *** for being dumb, but then hold you tightly in my arms so no one could hurt you again....|`|ym04vDkcaa	depression?|`|Mu3UvybKaa	For real?|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	I think you are very depressed or you want attention.  More often people are depressed. You need a counselor.|`|mhaxOQ5raa	Attention... Why else would you be on here asking about it?|`|iwqOtZPpaa	I don't know why you started, but you should really stop!|`|AA11641349	You want attention. As is the case with most people who "attempt" suicide.    Talk to somebody, anybody.|`|LiVfS4Zxaa	WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU KIDS TODAY? I myself am only 15; I consider myself precocious but it needs to be said...who dictated the fashion of cutting wrists? Call the Samaritans, go to a therapist or have a piece of cake to cheer yourself up. If you're seriously depressed, you need help, sweetie! (I'm pretty sure you're a girl!?!)    Good Luck!|`|2zgNP4z9aa	stop it immediately! That is an order!|`|NeAgoZj7aa	Yuv gawn nuckin futz n kneed ah guud friend ... IM Me|`|7xkwE3X9aa	Because maybe you are depressed..  I do that too sometimes when I feel like I need it.|`|liup711gaa	Because you are desperate for attention! grr emo people annoy me. Get of the computer and get some help. I have no pity for people who puposly harm themselves for attention. It is STUPID! Get a life and stop looking for pity cuz you aren't gonna get any....especially on the computer!|`|SXoz1P23aa	Normally people do it because they fall into such a deep depression they start to feel nothing at all except for pain which in itself is depressing enough but they start doing it so that they are in control of their pain that is what professionals say i also believe it but there is more to it in my opinion anyway it's something that lets you tell yourself you can still feel but if you keep it up the rates of you becoming addicted to heroin, crack, coke, or methamphetamine increases greatly but i cant tell you to see a shrink cause they are pretty much useless at least to me they were i used to cut to but after my friend kicked the crap out of me i kinda saw that i was hurting my self more and more and just making my self more depressed so i started changing my emotions listening to happier music and stuff it was forced at first but after a while i started to enjoy the brighter colors and happy music and the music i would recommend is  Daughtry and  even more so HelloGoodBye|`|f9b85050d33b3fd3ebe8752d14b6659baa	I did that too. If you really want help, you should talk to a good friend that you know well.... and definitely tell your parents how you feel. If you are afraid to tell them, tell them through a letter... and then see what they say. Sometimes we get this way..I know what depression feels like..and it hurts more than anything. Talk to someone, that always helps, but make sure its an adult, so that they can help you talk to people that know who can help you.   I hope you feel better. God bless.|`|DIlMYYBQaa	Girl, you better be kidding!!!! Talk to someone. Don't hurt yourself, your mom needs you more than anything right now!|`|spo9KBRpaa	do you wanna band aid?|`|hneetSf2aa	thats not good..get some help|`|7f2GSDmqaa	NO!!! Dont do that!!! Please get some help.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	i didnt even know you HAD writists  ?  seriously though - are you serious?    if you are serious, and you are sad or something - call someone, FAMILY or good friend and tell them - do it now.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Find a friend to talk to, try and explain why you feel like you have to do that. If you don't feel comfortable talking to a friend, there are other people who can help. Just let someone know you need to talk to them.|`|evEJxv06aa	you need help please stop hurting your self if you have a problem talk to your parents or go see a doctor he can help you i mean hurting your self is not going to solve your problems so please ask for help from either your parents or the doctor please!!!! life is very very Precious please don't ruin it like that its going to hurt you and your family very very much ok and normally people do that when they are in deep depression but if it gets out hand that you should ask for help.|`|vZlTKC0Vaa	Go see a psychiatrist.|`|AA12383908	You need to seek counseling. Talk to a parent or a trusted friend. Hope things get better for you. I know they will.|`|661f39420372e21b090f02f05da73dfaaa	Growing up is so hard, don't take it out on your self.|`|kEQX5sswaa	Stop now. Use plenty of Neosporin on your cuts. I know girls who are scarred up for life because of that crap. They have to wear long sleeves to hide it even in warm weather. You'll regret it later in life if you have to look at ugly scars every time you look at you own arms.|`|CApnEZ83aa	Get some help!|`|wPM6eBkWaa	Yikes, not so good.  Cutters have deep issues that only a professional can help you with.  Before it gets to bad, please seek help.|`|159e14ec854d24444172426d492de79eaa	well: you know something it is because of "Polls & Surveys says  yourself must answer Entertainment & Music  and please! go  see an Family psychologist basically they has Group recovery therapy  sessions just remember relax and enjoy some jazz music today"

If they sigh over and over for attention, I hate it.  If they sigh once, then it doesn't bother me.  Depends how bad their breath smells... :p|`|zRUHryuraa	*sigh*|`|nmDbEgXQaa	*sigh* Sorry, I couldn't resist! :P|`|IHP2QrEoaa	Depends on the situation|`|215d3acf00f732b247b6cc433098b991aa	loool  yeah i know what you mean  maybe they find it hard to breathe out normally|`|0oztnUbdaa	Only if it's repetitive.|`|ShIBKelQaa	it drives me nuts|`|orCK7reIaa	Sigh.......we can't help it dear.

AGbusTqGaa	JD- Seems ok unless he's wasted    Sarah- Wants to be the counselor of the house way too bad, its super annoying.  Her issue with her dad is slightly sketchy.  Unless theres more to the story I think she might be over exaggerating the molestation thing    Ryan- Really funny, slightly inappropriate at times but who isn't    Devyn- Hate her!  She is creepy and needs to get over Scott bc he obviously doesn't want to hook up with her    Scott- Boring, he never does or says anything    Katelyn- Needs a stylist and needs to do something about the dark circles under her eyes.  She is really annoying too and the situation wtih her boyfriend is kinda ridiculous.  She's way into him and he obvioulsy doesn't feel the same way or he would have called her when she was gone.    Chet - Gay Gay Gay!!!!!!!!!!!    Baya - I haven't figured out why but I do not like her.  Its also really shady that she's sleeping in Ryans bed knowing that he has a gf that he talks to everyday.  Kinda slutty...    This is probably the worst season ever so far|`|G4wDlSh7aa	i think it's the MOST interesting cast yet.  they picked very diverse people this time which i think is good.  i like everybody.|`|56dfvnwmaa	heres what I think of everyone thus far.     JD-is nice when he's sober but an ignorant idiot when he's drunk.     Sarah-probably the most open minded and so far I see nothing wrong with her. but there will be cause eventually JD tells her that she contradicted herself or something.    Ryan-funny and whatnot but doesnt know how to keep things to himself though. 1st day and already asking if Katelyn is a guy? too soon buddy    Devyn-needs to get her crush over Scott. and enough of this BFF o meter crap. its very stalker like    Scott-so far nothing bad to say about him. although he's a bit too much in the background    Katelyn-acts a bit sIutty when things dont go her way with her boyfriend. I mean one thing is grinding with others, no biggie but kissing them. ok     Chet-probably the most open minded there and educated and tolerant along with Sarah.     but hey this is why we watch this show. if everyone was perfect it would be boring. if you dont hate someone on a reality tv show then chances are it wont be very interesting.|`|ciXSjbCiaa	These people are so boring and dull. The only one that is dynamic is Sarah. It just amazes me that out of all people in the world, they chose this group. It seems as though the casts get more boring and more shallow the longer this show is on. I really wish they would go for people that were interesting and actually had things to offer.

Best birthday ever.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	I may not have a birthday cake, but there would always be some kind of cake and I would put a candle on it for my husband and myself.  I would blow the candle out and I would make a wish as well.  When our son was little I loved buying birthday cakes for him and watching him blow the candles out and make a wish.|`|HRQjffv8aa	Nope    =.= apparently my parents think 14yr olds are too old for candles.. but i get cake , no party- id probably be too lazy to go to my own party anyway|`|XWwnf90paa	I never have a cake but i buy everyone of my family one, am just bout to go to tesco for one for my mums birthday tomorrow, i always put candles on for them x|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No, not for years.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	February 14th.|`|3uz3DMJgaa	i take em off when im done blowing em out|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Of course yes, im guilty of that even now im in my thirties! still waiting for that wish to come true though!|`|HAhm1TUoaa	I haven't had a birthday cake in a few years.|`|XAAF7R23aa	no the cake would not be big enough, lol|`|H6D6jlKGaa	no i dnt have a cake with candles on i, i hate cake its horrible.. i used to have  a cake when i was younger jus for the candles n then my bro would eat all the cake lol|`|aScafPEOaa	Yes|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	I make the wish before I blow out the candles.  It only comes true if you blow them all out at once with one blow. These days one pink candle represents each decade for me, with one white for the single years. That's an advantage of being too old to put all the candles on the cake, it is easier to get them all with one blow!  LOL!|`|wnnudNp5aa	Haven't had a birthday cake in a few years. But we go out to eat on my birthday, and I can have cake then if i want it.|`|OMApFdWnaa	yes all part of the fun|`|BIqXrr9kaa	yeah only if i get the cake myself my hubby never does anything like that for me...my last birthday i didnt even get a present!! :(

You told me not to drink, Mom, so I drank soda instead  I really felt proud inside, Mom, the way you said I would.  I didn't drink and drive, Mom, even though the others said I should.  I know I did the right thing, Mom, I know you are always right.    Now the party is finally ending  Mom, as everyone is driving out of sight.  As I got into my car, Mom, I knew I'd get home in one piece.  Because of the way you raised me, so responsible and sweet.  I started to drive away, Mom, but as I pulled out into the road,  the other car didn't see me, Mom, and hit me like a load.    As I lay there on the pavement, Mom, I hear the policeman say,  the other guy is drunk, Mom, and now I'm the one who will pay.  I'm lying here dying, Mom.. I wish you'd get here soon.  How could this happen to me, Mom? My life just burst like a balloon.  There is blood all around me, Mom, and most of it is mine.  I hear the medic say, Mom, I'll die in a short time.    I just wanted to tell you, Mom, I swear I didn't drink.  It was the others, Mom. The others didn't think.  He was probably at the same party as I.  The only difference is, he drank and I will die.  Why do people drink, Mom? It can ruin your whole life.  I'm feeling sharp pains now. Pains just like a knife.    The guy who hit me is walking, Mom, and I don't think it's fair.  I'm lying here dying and all he can do is stare.  Tell my brother not to cry, Mom. Tell Daddy to be brave.  And when I go to heaven, Mom, put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave.  Someone should have told him, Mom, not to drink and drive.    If only they had told him, Mom, I would still be alive.  My breath is getting shorter, Mom. I'm becoming very scared.  Please don't cry for me, Mom. When I needed you, you were always there.  I have one last question, Mom, before I say good bye.  I didn't drink and drive, so why am I the one to die?|`|cNySQ2axaa	concrete angel by martina mcbride|`|AF6d9PUgaa	Concrete Angel and Who Knew?

ZyGyDLsDaa	Flash Gordon (1980)  starring Sam J. Jones, Max von Sydow, Melody Anderson, Topol, Timothy Dalton, Brian Blessed, Ornella Muti, Peter Wyngarde, Mariangela Melato, Richard O'Brien (creator of and actor in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"), William Hootkins (Porkins of "Star Wars Chapter IV: A New Hope")// Watch for Deep Roy as the Princess's pet!  IMDb synopsis:  In this update of the 1930s comic strip, Flash Gordon is a football hero who is skyjacked aboard Dr. Zarkov's rocketship along with beautiful Dale Arden. The threesome are drawn into the influence of the planet Mongo, controlled by Ming the Merciless. Ming has been testing Earth with unnatural disasters, and, deeming it a threat to his rule, he plans to destroy it. He also intends to take Dale as his concubine. Flash must avoid the amorous attentions of Ming's daughter and unite the warring kingdoms of Mongo to rescue Dale and save our world.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  I saw this in the theater and even went back several times, as I thought it was pretty darn good! Since then, I've lost count of how many times I've seen it. I have a collection of quotations, including "You have until the sands run UP." and "No! Not the bore worms!"     However, I don't think a warrior actually gets pulled in, just stabbed by the critter that is inside the trunk. In their initiation, they agitate the creature, then each person being initiated has to shove his hand and arm down into the hole and hope he isn't stung because he will have to be killed quickly or will die a very slow, agonizing death. Later, Prince Barin (Dalton) and Flash (Jones) have a competition of this, rather like playing Russian roulette. Now, I'm going to be trying to think of a movie in which a snake grabs a warrior. Hmmmm... For now, I'll stick with "Flash Gordon", but I will delete this if I find another possibility.     If you go to 4:30, you can see the initiation:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB7QFAPF4...  Is that what you remember?|`|ZFj7J3Zaaa	$T@R W@R$    STAR WARS|`|zs38LPu4aa	erm....Flash Gordon?    probably not though but there's a big toughness test that's a bit similar to that in the film|`|UiYLc7WBaa	Sounds like Flash Gordon, although the guys hand gets stung, rather than him getting pulled in. Then they kill him to end his suffering.

ngiV2fb9aa	You'd be amazed at how just changing how you pronounce your vowels while you sing makes you sound better. Sounding almost british while you sing makes the vowels sound so much nicer to listen to.     Remember this:  "A"- Dead  "E"- Rain  "I"- Ahh  "O" Open  "U"- Loop    Another thing to remember about singing is to know your range. If you're a alto trying to sing a operatic high notes, it isn't going to sound good. So figure out with range your voice is and sing pieces that go good with your voice.|`|AA11195316	try these folks   www.vocalcoach.com  good luck|`|nIV0oAGNaa	Practise Lots, Drink Plenty of Water and ask your parents if you could try singing lessons?|`|1VeqStpmaa	Practice, practice, practice.  If you can, take lessons or work with a friend.  There's something called opening your larynx which lets you sing with more volume without losing pitch.  It just takes training.

Hollywood ending.  They're a better or more accurate depiction of how life truly is.  Sometimes the bad guys gets away.  In the case of "Zodiac," the film is based on true events.  So in real life, as far as that story is concerned, the bad guy did, in fact, get away.    As for worst movie I've ever watched - Battlefield Earth takes the cake.|`|1ZW2rzkYaa	the cat in the hat w/ mike myers.      lost 2 hours of my life with that one|`|GRB4vt4Qaa	Anything that says it is going to be scary and then results in the killer stabbing obvious packets of fake blood. My worst film would have to be either Butchered, these people got murdered in front of the camera and you could see the outline of the blood packets up their clothes. Two hours of my life i will never get back.  Also another film you should definitely not watch is Cloverfield, it was crap. I walked out of the cinema twenty minutes after it started.

I actually paid money to see it in the theater.  I sometimes wonder how they can continue making a movie that bad.

ZtnXNbaEaa	im a cancer female... and yes cancers if they say they love they mean it... they are very sensitive and give respect to feelings the most... they dont entertain any fake love... if they say "i love you right away then you can actually doubt them or it may be in their rush to get a boyfrined... but typical matured cancer dont entertain using such sensible words jus like that... and coming to libras im dating a libra guy... they hold back a lott to say the L word... since libras are very judgemental and takes lotta time to make decisions... but if they say it they mean it... i've seen so many of my friends libra boyfriends who are deeply involved in relationship with their mates... so its very hard to find whether a libra likes someone or not... since they seem very superficial and light hearted in any relationship... anyways finally i can say... if both cancer and libra are matured... they are very true in relationshops and they mean what they say...  i guess cancers mean the most... since generally  libra guys are little flirtatious and its not easy to tie them down in Love coz they look for pros and cons in every situation..   by the way nice question :) even im wondering whether my libra boyfriend love me or not... almost the same situation|`|3yp7TRUoaa	Cancer. Cancer's a water sign and are very emotional. People say that Libra's are superficial, that might be true, but i know a lot of Libras and they are too free-spirited to commit. But when they do, their I love you's are very sincere. Cancer might only say it cause they're too kind and they don't want to hurt your feelings. Libra women (that i know of) take their time to have serious boyfriends, and you can tell when they do cause they talk a lot about them! So both are pretty sincere, it just depends how far into the relationship they say it. Cancers can get a little clingy too quickly so it might be a little early in the relationship. It's because they're so emotional. Even if they seem unstable, they know how they feel about someone, and feel that there's nothing wrong in expressing your love, as long as you're sincere. And cancers are surprisingly, pretty in check with their feelings! Libra's a changeable so they might not mean it later in the relationship, OR they realize that they do, later in the relationship.    Sorry for the messy answer!
TpG33NoWaa	I simply cannot understand your question.     By 'hot', do you mean 'suffering from excessive ambient temperature'?     Are you 'panting from overwork' in this nice photo?    Or do you mean 'sexually exciting'?    If the female person you are contemplating is unduly influenced by how you look, you should really look elsewhere, anyway, I feel.   You are slightly insecure, perhaps, maybe intuitively attributing superficiality to this girl?    If you live in a community that habitually measures people's 'hotness' only by their appearance (rather than by their 'performance'), why not move to somewhere a bit more adult in outlook?    Oh, I forgot....   You look 'hot'  enough for any normal purpose, I suppose.   As you are a member of my species, I prefer not to allocate a 'mark out of 10' for something so relatively unimportant!|`|j6SUkE4Raa	try to charm hurr instead.......|`|spo9KBRpaa	looks arent everything  you seem like a nice guy...  just believe in yourself hunnie..  and if she turns you down, just dust yourself off and move on :)|`|7f2GSDmqaa	0...sorry pal|`|AA11790156	you look like the guy from the Hanna montana show|`|1PGmB4JNaa	10!

If you have a great personality,sense of humor etc.....and are fun to be around and really nice you could rank really high on the scale of 1-10 but really I would have to know you before I could rate you,but do keep in mind how important those things factor into your looks....|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Most importantly, if she doesn't like you, it doesn't mean you're not attractive. Another girl, who you like too, will think you're gorgeous. Not all attractions are likewise, looks are subjective.     There is no factual 'hotness rating', it's only in one person's opinion.   In my opinion, you're definitely cute - 8/10.|`|6bxOT9qJaa	I bet you have a great personality!     Just have confidence in yourself. That's one of the most attractive traits!|`|0Re4PPq9aa	WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IT MAKE? CAN YOU AFFORD PLASTIC SURGEY NO?!?|`|nmDbEgXQaa	I don't like putting numbers on people, but you are really cute!

Then I ate some smoothie drink and vomited in it. You might be the ugliest man that I have ever seen, seriously that was disgusting and sick/nasty. I would rather eat my own diarrhea then to have to look at you. You look like a box of cheeze its that were roasted and burnt, except that your not even cheeze its your cheese nips which are the gross nasty ones that nobody likes at all. Seriously if beauty was measured by trees then I would say your definitely a stump.  You look like Michael Jackson's armpit after he had all those weird surgeries and is now like a man/woman and albino black, you are ugly man. Muy feo. Muy, muy feo. Just in case you only understand spanish. If I was your mother I would leave you on the street in a box cause I would hate to have a child that looks like you as my own, maybe some nun or something will have mercy on you, maybe not. I would start saving up for some type of surgery given your situation you could probably just go to the fair and I'm sure that people would pay to laugh at you or throw tomatoes at you, that would accelerate your process towards plastic surgery. What can someone do with you? You have no chance with that girl- like none, maybe you should start liking guys and try that out to see if you'll be more successful. I pity you.        .....But maybe you have a good personality, so.....|`|y3XywUBLaa	WOOO!!! HAWT MAMA! U r some sexy thang!!!

vqg6wpCLaa	Godzilla just cause she's super amazing. Yes, she.    Anyway, even if Godzilla were to lose, there is always all those kids she had that could take King Kong in seconds.     Power wise though, I would definitely say Godzilla again. So far, Godzilla has yet to be killed; defeated, yes, killed, no. That being said, we know that Godzilla has a lot of durability. Then there is King Kong who got shot down by the helicopters - he went down pretty easily, in my opinion.     So, the winner would be GODZILLA!|`|8gXCjxl9aa	king kong is dead so i am guessing godzilla|`|8e7ZxOL1aa	i know there is a moive in jap but subed in eng its got king kong godziller and some turtle and they fight it out the hole moive its pretty good for its age ii dont member who wins i think humans lol as always but look it up on youtube type it in the top it should come up fight agains king kong and godziller worth a try|`|EHWsPsmxaa	I'd say King Kong because he's more mobile than Godzilla. Plus King Kong can wrap his arms around Godzilla and toss him if he wanted too. Godzilla moves way too slow and has T-Rex arms.|`|4JQ71C1caa	King Kong|`|6rR7LTl1aa	If there's one lesson we've learned, it's that Godzilla *always* comes back.    Also, points for armored skin, projectile/beam weaponry, and not being flammable or prone to climb things.|`|05o0D2Yuaa	If both were alive and willing to fight each other in a sanctioned event, I'd give the nod to Godzilla for several reasons:    1) He breathes fire, so that's gotta be a plus for any fight  2) He's got that scaly skin so I'm sure that's gonna come in handy as armor for the king kong punches  3) He's got a tail he can use in addition to his arms and legs  4) King Kong gets too easily distracted by the ladies    My money's on Godzilla.
p3qrj7HDaa	yes, yes, and yes!    Much more so as an adult, rather than when he was younger.

aeiP74PLaa	this is funny cuz i live in japan and my gf is really into mation(thats what they call american cartoons here) she wears a bobby hill backpack and has weird cartoon porn of the jetsons|`|KzUBsF3Maa	ooooh man  u teased her about anime? no wonder she broke up with you  i would have done the same thing(not that i have a boyfriend)  and it has nothing to do with colour of skin  it is a little immature to break up over animies but i know how it feels  because anime is the thing u don get in real world but find in anime  u tease or make fun abt it .its like u make fun of the bull's tail  u get the horns  but don ever do it again cause it hurts me too|`|XNIkS3KNaa	No trust me that's not the case.    I'm probably one of the most mature girls out there, always have been and I've loved anime for over 15 years.  Also it's not nice to tease no matter what it is especially to the point of almost tears.  If your with someone you should except them for everything they are.    Although she was wrong to assume you liked anime based on the way you looked.  In my opinion then you were both at fault.      The point is no matter what it is, if it's anime or something else the persons personality is what makes them mature or immature.  Not what they like or don't like.  Hope I helped some. :)|`|Syc0F9D8aa	No offense, but if you were teasing her to that extent it is easily understandable that she would want to break up.|`|VmXq5NCOaa	False idea    @ Paul C --No, not all Asians love anime. I know plenty of Asians who DON'T LIKE anime. I win. Don't stereotype. Gotta problem? THEN TOO BAD because your observations are WRONG.|`|hSpsroCXaa	I really don't think "anime girls" are weirder than any other girl, teasing someone until their almost in tears continuously is enough reason to break up with someone no matter what your teasing her about.    It just shows a lack of respect for the person that you expect to be with you.  I don't think teasing someone until their crying or almost crying can be considered kidding, can it ?|`|4bFypdGLaa	Nah. Of course immature anime girls (and boys) exist. But that has hardly anything to do with anime... But it can depend on what anime she was watching I mean if she was 17 and was always watching Yu-gi-oh, I'd be pretty sure there was a connection between the immaturity and the anime. But most popular anime among older is made for mature people, deep stories and mature situations and language.    As for the teasing..I mean my friend that watches Vampire Knight (anime) witch I think it's something only 12 year olds can enjoy, but I have no reason to tease her, I mean I'm sure she finds some of the things I watch or do in real life weird.    And duh! Of course it just racist to assume all japanese, or even all asians, like or even know what anime is.... I mean most anime fans I know are White and some Black .. I know no Asian anime fans (in real life I know some on the internet of course.)    .....and one more thing I watch anime and I often wonder if it's just my location or if all people my age are so insanely immature, it sometimes borders in retarded how much some of my classmates act.|`|HRQjffv8aa	You teased her for what she likes and who she is and you deserved what you got, how would you tease your grilfriend to the point of tears or even close. Cant you accept a person for who they are.|`|aaf06036662e5585eae277522d859cd1aa	Your just annoyed that she broke up with you -.- No need to take it out on female Anime-fans >.|`|8hVz7gPXaa	firstly i am an anime girl and when my bf/friends teased me about anime  i got really annoyed i mean ANIME IS SO COOL but thats just me but seriously u shouldnt have teased her that much .. if she kept telling you about anime or stuff like that u should have just told her that u dont really like anime and that you will still love her if she likes it or not|`|AA12076018	I can understand her point of view. My dad constantly annoys me about watching anime. It would either upset me or make me angry. But then I'd get over it as it was his opinion not mine. I do however agree that it was kinda immature of her to break up with you over. And no we are not immature we just like anime. I have a love of art and view anime as art. The same with manga. I would say it's her that's immature or not understanding. Not girls in general. You are probably a great guy and I'm sorry she didn't see that.|`|jpfrJRE3aa	ok it doesn't matter whether you like anime or not because some people will always be immature. secondly ALOT of people watch anime and not all of them are immature. oh yh shes not immature for breaking up with you, she broke up with you because you teased her.     oh yh i think its bad that she thought that you liked anime because of the colour of your skin.|`|Ug7vrO4Iaa	You're both immature. You for teasing her enough to make her almost cry, and her for almost crying over something so dumb.|`|v1hCymAEaa	Well it is understandable why she broke up with you, it wasnt nice to tease her to the point of tears, girls can be pretty sensitive when guys do stuff like that, even if you were just joking I would proably break up with you too (no offense.)    You should have just accepted what she liked and just told her your not into it, even if you are asian. She did kind of stereotype you which was wrong but like I said you should have just told her from the beginning. It sounds like you werent that into her anyway so maybe it was a good thing it ended before the relationship got serious.    Im a girl and I dont find myself weird and I have a lot of friends so not all girls who like anime are weird. Some can be a little more fangirly than others but it doesnt necessarily make them weird just a fan of anime.    :-P|`|6qDhXpWfaa	Somehow it's hard to believe she broke up with you because you teased her about anime. If you were like "You're such a nerd, why do you watch that crap" - which you probably weren't (?), then yeah, that's understandable, but light teasing wouldn't make her break up with you. I think she just used that as an excuse to hide the real reason of ending the relationship with you.     Unless she was COMPLETELY obsessed with it, which seems unlikely cause then why would you two be together?     You're right about her assuming you like anime b/c of the colour of your skin, cause that's just playing on stereotypes.

d014f113fb3eecfed19b0fbba5d885d9aa	First of all - your throat contains muscles that needs exercise to vibrate appropriately for singing.  Even the professional singer must warm up before a performance just as any athlete in any sporting event.    So first off, since you stated that you have not been trying to sing lately, your voice box is out of practice and as you get older, will continue to restrict you from singing a large octave range if you do not do something to stretch the muscles and exercise your throat.      What is needed is to work up (slowly at first) to a daily vocal exercise routine / octave scales which will start to stretch your vocal cords and allow you to sing larger and large ranges.  If your grandmother is around, ask her what vocal exercise that she has used.  Otherwise, ask the music director or choir director at your school what is being taught in the singing classes.    Also doing any number of physical exercises, especially ones dealing with deep breathing, will also help develop a diaphragm that can sustain a vocal note over time.  Learning to take deep breaths and sustain the exhaling can do a lot for vocal support.    I learned a number of exercise from singing with choirs while in high school and college and have used them to maintain some of my range.  I have not been as consistent as I should, but still command a good voice.  Singing in church has also helped me a lot.|`|4n3ZGd8uaa	I've heard of a procedure done to keep a high note when singing. If you do some research on Michael Jackson you should find that he had a procedure done to keep his voice sounding like he hasn't hit puberty.   No BS, you should really look into it if you take your singing seriously.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	of course your 10 year old brother can sing higher than you.  his voice hasn't dropped yet.  that's nothing to be worried about.  seriously.    as far as retraining your voice.  aside from working with a professional, you could just do your own exercises. start with a five note scale, say CDEFG and back down GFEDC. sing "beedee" (sounds dumb i know) for each note. when you get back down to the C, go up a half or full step. continue as high as you can go. the next day do same and see if you can push your voice a half step higher. if you can, focus on that higher note for a few days until it sounds good and then continue.  you want to make sure that you don't overwork your vocal chords as you could do a lot of damage.  drink plenty of ROOM TEMPERATURE water.  when you're singing you don't want cold water because it could shock your vocal chords and make them freak out and your efforts would be fruitless.    experiment with different vowel sounds when you do the exercise.  you can do an "oo-ahh" sound or lalala or whatever really.  Good luck!
Leda2ha0aa	Jamie.  It should have been Leah, but Jamie's celery was way too salty in her meal and so she was let go.

GOJ5LzBNaa	Is this a coincidence or have I missed a news item on TV or something. The CEO of Boeing was, I am given to understand, recently interviewed on this very subject. This is a rough approximation of his answer.    " Boeing Co. is lengthening the passenger version of its new 747 widebody jet so airlines can squeeze in about 17 extra seats, a move that will bring the new plane a tad closer to the seating capacity of rival Airbus' massive A380."     "The 747-8 Intercontinental will now seat 467, up from 450 in the previous design, Mr.Ah Now, unknown executive for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a recent Web log posting. The passenger version is now expected to be 250 feet, 8 inches, the same length as the freighter version of the new airplane."     The current 747-400 model seats 416 squirrels.     I cannot utterly rely upon this information so if you must know with more certainty I would give them a ring up in Seattle.|`|C1y4sOfFaa	one.|`|HxAyoEQVaa	ONE BUT HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE REALLY BIG NUTZ|`|SCiY5JESaa	........|.....  ........|..........NUTS     ........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)

Family: The Princess Bride  Western: Dances With Wolves  SciFi: Jurassic Park  Sports: The Natural  Foreign: Les Quatre Cent Coups (The 400 Blows)  Rom-com: When Harry Met Sally  Classic: Stagecoach    It's not really fair to compare "Monsters, Inc."  with "Schindler's List"

kHqmlta4aa	Because the BBC has invested megabucks in Ross's contract and if it were to admit to itself, and publicly, that it had made a major mistake in contracting this buffoon at 18,000,000 over 3 years it would look bad for some very senior people.  Much better for them to put it down as a temporary lapse and give him a smack on the wrist.  Somebody should be sacking the idiots who approved his contract in the first place.  (To put it in context, 18,000,000 is about what the BBC raises for Children In Need.)|`|cpyENCTcaa	Whilst there is some truth in the other answers, the simple fact of the matter is that what Carol T said was racially motivated whilst Jonathan R and Brand's telephone prank was just a bit of sick joke not thought through.

23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	Neither offer you you good value.    Sky is expensive and if you go for Sky HD you will be paying over 30/month before you add on the cost of movies and sports. True, you can get broadband and phone included but you still have to pay for a BT line rental on top of the Sky subscription (they don't mention that in the adverts). You will have to pay for "installation" even if you're capable of doing it yourself. Sky HD costs more to "install" and rent too. Most of the HD films are on premium channels that attract further subscriptions.    Virgin is slightly cheaper, you don't have to pay for a BT line. But you must be in a cabled road. Strangely enough, they don't mention that not every road is cabled. Have a look at your pavements and see if you can find manhole covers with something like CATV cast on them. If there aren't any then you are out of luck.    Freesat is available for a one-off purchase of a receiver and dish (typically less than 200 including installation). There is no monthly subscription. Freesat HD offers you subscription-free HD reception but there is not the same range of HD channels as Sky.    Freeview is very cheap. It uses your ordinary aerial, if it's good enough. A Freeview box can cost less than 20 (but it's a basic one). There is no HD on Freeview yet but there may be Freeview HD available by the end of this year.    BT V-Box is a pay as you go service available to BT Broadband subscribers. It doesn't even need an aerial if you are happy to watch the BT selected channels. They offer pay-per-view films and HD so you're not paying for channels or programmes that you don't want. If you already have BT broadband (which also includes a phone service) there is no economic sense to use Sky or Virgin.    Having said all that, you should note that the channel line-up is not the same on all "delivery platforms". Have a look at what Freeview, Freesat, Sky, Virgin and BT offer before you make up your mind. It would be bad if you had the cheapest service and then found out that your favourite channel is only carried by someone else.|`|WU7wpxe7aa	sky obviously its got wayyyy mor channels and u can get free broadband with it and virgin its jus like freeview|`|4HTMZ97Saa	We have both Sky+ and V+ (virgins rip - off of Sky+) in our house, and they're quite hard to separate on pros and cons.   Sky has the advantage of channels like Sky One, Sky Boxoffice (worth mentioning that Sky allows you to record films you buy, Virgin doesn't) and a good interactive service, but Virgin has huge archives of tv programmes, movies, music and catch up tv in its on demand service (this depends on what package you get)   Be wary of Sky in the rain/bad weather - I get all sorts of problems with poor signal in the rain etc. and get some interference when planes go over, whereas with Virgin you wouldn't have any problems like that.  Virgin also takes an age to start up when you turn the power on which can be annoying, and its remote can have a mind of its own at times!  I couldn't recommend one because they both have their own strong points. Just check out packages from both|`|SUR1MHqWaa	sky all the way|`|ioKKaSvEaa	To be honest i have sky but my friend have top up tv - freeview top up and you top up your channels when you want more and you don't have to pay monthly were changing to that soon|`|CcR9kvHhaa	I have just switched from Sky to Virgin Media. I didn't want to but we had to. Sky was costing us 60 and month whilst we now only pay 24. 7.99 of that is free unlimited calls to home phones only. No matter how much you call a home phone it will cost 7.99 (or around that)...    Outcome - Virgin Media   :-)      + you have catch-up t.v.|`|fVF5IdDvaa	Swapped from Sky to Virgin after spending two summers with no TV reception at all after the tree outside grew leaves and blocked the signal!  Windy day?  Forget watching telly, the picture breaks up too much to be watchable.  That said Sky broadand is a good deal, and Sky has more channels for your money.  Just make sure they do a PROPER site survey when they install it - allowing for the trees etc.    Virgin has decent broadband (just dropped from their 10mb to their 2mb package without a noticable loss of speed!) and the TV never breaks up.  Virgin on Demand service is fantastic too - I can spend ages going through the music videos.    Cost wise they are pretty much the same - however after you've been whichever one you choose for a year, ring them up and tell them that you want to switch - they'll try and keep your business with some extra hidden deals!|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Virgin does not  cover many areas,there does  not seem   any movement towards extending thier cable links.  I do like sky indeed have always had it they were first 24 hour news channel.  All in all  I think Sky gives best value for money.The person that is only paying 24.99 per month is that for all the channels you had when on Sky my son had an offer like   that it jumped considerably after a couple of months|`|CWW0V7kOaa	Most of the answers you are getting don't have a clue about Virgin.    It has EVERYTHING you can get on Sky including Sky 1 etc, As with Sky it depends on the package you get as to whats in it ... Sports, Films, Sentanta etc but it is cheaper overall, has features (BBC iPlayer and better catch up) not on Sky and is more reliable as it's cable.    The biggest Virgin plus point for me ... If you have a problem the telephone / tech support is a million times better than anything I found with Sky, and unlike Sky, calls are free and they will call you back and turn up if there's anything you need.     I dumped Sky originally as they seem to employ chimps to deal with tech faults, charge a fortune to call them to try and sort their problems and want paying to call out to fix their own kit if their chimp can't explain to you how you should fix their problem in the 10 minutes per call they allow their operators for each call before it cuts off  forcing you to call back and start the merry-go-round again!    Oh ... and the Phones free and the Broadbands lightning!|`|ajPHMliqaa	sky.....u can get 30 ok channels for free and lots of radio too      http://www.freesat.co.uk/index.php?page=...|`|1nMkURyPaa	sky because u get sky sports and sentana sports|`|69b91f42927e8e3de27734e3a92e06f6aa	I have both and prefer Sky for ease of use. It is very clear to use    BUT     Virgin for all the extras you get such as whole series of old programmes, loads of catch up tv (Sky only has a small amount) and music videos you can watch for free.    PS. Also if you live near trees, you can lose your sky picture in Summer and also in bad weather.    Virgin remote takes a couple of seconds to do the action you have requested too - it doesn't sound like a big deal but it gets really annoying after a while.|`|Bu6lx93Jaa	it depends. sky have more hd channels but most are movie or sports channels you have to pay extra for.   With cable your guaranteed decent download speeds as the signal is through cable not going through a telephone exchange|`|ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	I have the full Virgin phone, broadband and digital TV package. It is expensive but......    The broadband, even at 2mg is fast and reliable. I can watch streamed (video without downloading) channels and TV without any problems at all.  The telephone is at a good rate where I get calls to 01 and 02 numbers free. If I search 'saynoto0870' I can call all calls free  The digital TV service includes Setanta and all the Sky channels for a fixed rate. It is reliable and includes every UK digital radio station and programme.  I don't like Sky dishes. We had one and it did damage when it came loose in very high winds.

dPyfP0ijaa	Theres really no average, I was on the teens on my "list" when my best friend had 2.    Everyone's different whether you're a bit slutty or a bit conservative.    The best thing to remember is only sleep with one person at a time and don't sleep with the next person for a few weeks after the last relationship ended.    Give yourself time to be sure you're not pregnant and get yourself tested between each person.    The worst thing is to end up pregnant and not know the father or with an std you might be spreading and not know who it came from    use a condom!!|`|S5Hij07Haa	one per relation ship

GgAClEQUaa	If you download bittorrent then you will be able to download films and music for free, by using torrent sites such as www.mininova.com. Bittorrent is available from their homepage for free, just google it. It is, however, illegal.    Also, in response to the above, so long as you are vigilant in what you download and do not accept any files other than the file you want, and ensure that the file size seems right for your target download, you will not get any viruses.|`|351qtoozaa	it is possible to get them for free but you have to be willing to steal from the movie industry and cost people jobs and they could depend on that. but y'know if u wanna save that $5 and dont care about the other stuff then be my guest just dont ask me|`|HkSSJXE9aa	well you can install utorrent and then search the movie you want on btjunkie.com or install limewire and also if you use firefox you can get downloadhelper's extension and downthemall extension for firefox and you can download any videos or movies from any site such as ov-guide that will find the sites for you...|`|cEuFh0T8aa	illegally some websites|`|wjOMEHoHaa	nothing is free literally!|`|GvgmSxdCaa	Not possible to get them for free...    There are such things called Torrents ...     But they contain viruses and it is in violation of Copyright laws.     Best thing to do ... Pay for the movies.|`|cfdcea076742739e75b363443aad92a9aa	illegally stealing movies dot com

l0rKjtUDaa	I thought the same way.  we say that here in Arkansas all the time.  I thought it was courteous and respectful.... she's weird anyway.  I mean i like her but sometimes i think she's popping too many pills before she gets out there.. lol.|`|AA10041941	I am in Kentucky lived here my whole life * in fact the guy that said that was from pretty close to where I grew up* and I say that ALL the time.. maybe its a Kentucky thing? I tell my boyfriend each day before he goes to work I love you, be careful! its not meant in the way they took it of course! LOL seriously.. thats too funny when I seen that I just KNEW for some reason they would take it the wrong way..heheh you all be careful now ya hear me? HAHAH!|`|iYoCZVpmaa	Ummm...  i don't understand the question ?|`|KmC0K59taa	Yeah, this was NOT a threat.  I talked to several others who watched it and felt the same way.  The show just wants to create drama and they showed the clip all week of the "threat."|`|uSu7guCsaa	I spent a lot of time in the Southern United States and love that region. I was amazed by the entire panel (and show for that matter) when they tried to crucify the guy for saying "be careful." I heard it all of the time. Kind of like saying..."Whatcha know good" or "How bout' it" or "Take care." American Idol owes that guy a BIG apology and needs to wake up to not all of America is British or Hollywood. :)|`|nztycnvfaa	I'm guessing that the reason Paula thought it was a threat is because she is jumpy now. There was actually a girl that competed on the show that killed herself right in front of Paula's house. If I were Paula, I would be a little nervous as well.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well there are people that we don't need to know about.|`|yJd1WwF2aa	Okay can people stop make such a big deal about it? They didn't understand. Neither did I when i first heard it, until like two weeks ago when the SHOW SAID SORRY for the misunderstanding     Simon from England so it doesn't surprise me that he didn't get it. Paula's not from the South. But I am surprised Randy didn't get it b/c he was born and grew up in like Georgia or Louisiana.
cfQnuJU7aa	No it was Carter Burwell that did Bella's lullaby Robert Pattinson did the songs (let me sign) and (never think)|`|EZKe92TTaa	No, I believe at the end someone else wrote the music for the Lullaby|`|heZONliaaa	No, Carter Burwell was.

Have you try Katekyou Hitman Reborn! yet? KHR! is an ongoing Shounen anime.        --- KATEKYOU HITMAN REBORN! ---    KHR! is about a boy named Tsunayoshi Sawada [Tsuna] who is a total loser (studies, sports, girls, life >.>) & nicknamed 'No Good Tsuna' [Dame Tsuna]. He has zero friends & dang hopeless -__-    One day, a very strong infant named Reborn, who is a hitman from Italy, comes to him & tells him that he will be the 10th generation boss of a Mafia family, the infamous Vongola Family & he will train him to become an admirable Mafia boss. At first, Tsuna refuses to do anything related to the Mafia, but then, he gains lots of friends & when danger comes, he is willing to risk himself for the sake of others. In the earlier episodes, you may not find Tsuna interesting coz he had to rely on the Dying Will Bullet to get strong, but as the story gets deeper, Tsuna changed & totally FTW!!! XD    You should read the manga too. There are some differences between the manga & anime, like, in the anime, they didnt show Longchamp Naito & too much blood. The charries there bleed a lot where fighting but yeah, the anime version didnt show it -__-      It's really cool coz it has both comedy & action- typical shounen. There is a little romance too.  All the guys there totally kickass like, Gokudera Hayato (weapon: dynamites), Yamamoto Takeshi (weapon: katana), Hibari Kyoya (weapon: tonfas), Rokudo Mukuro & Chrome Dokuro (weapon: Trident & Illusions), Sasagawa Ryohei (weapon: his fists.. he's a boxer), Lambo (weapon: able to control thunder, 10-Year Bazooka), Sawada Tsuna (weapon: X-Gloves. Dang his weapon is the coolest!!! XD)    I already make my cousin (who makes fun of KHR! at first) & a few Contacts to watch KHR! and now they are totally ADDICTED to it. Heh. =D  Genres: Shounen, School, Comedy, Action      KHR! main HQ :D  http://vongolahq.wordpress.com/  Read Manga here!  http://www.onemanga.com/Katekyo_Hitman_R...       BUT    If you want Romance:::     VAMPIRE KNIGHT    Cross Academy is different from other schools. It has a Day Class and a Night Class, with different uniforms and no interaction between these two classes. Secretly, students of the Night Class are all vampires, led by Kuran Kaname, a noble vampire who 10 years prior saved Cross Yuki from the attack of a stray vampire. Now a Guardian of the Night Class vampires, Yuki works along with fellow classmate Kiriyuu Zero, a young man with a hatred for vampires deeper than anything she could imagine. Together, they protect Kaname and the Night Class vampires from having their identities revealed, as well as protect Day Class students from any vampire attacks that occur do to a vampire's natural thirst for blood. Based on the manga by Hino Matsuri.    Genres: Vampire, Supernatural, Shoujo, Romance, Mystery, Drama     CLANNAD    Tomoya Okazaki is a third year student labelled as a delinquent. Everything seems to be unchanging for his school life until he meets Nagisa, and Tomoya finds that his life is about to change. He starts to have dreams of a bleak world and meets a girl who has the ability to fuse junk together in order to create things, and doing so, creates a body out of junk for him. He is then reborn into this empty world and follows around the girl, the only two existences who are "alive".    Genres: Supernatural, Slice of Life, School, Romance, Fantasy, Drama, Comedy     AISHITERUZE BABY    Katakura Kippei is in every way a high school playboy. Spending his days flirting with any female he can see, responsibility is the last thing on his mind. Life takes an unexpected turn for him as one day he returns home to find himself with the fulltime task of caring for his 5 year old cousin. Kippei's aunt Miyako had disappeared, appearing to have abandoned his cousin, Yuzuyu. With Kippei's lack of responsibility and knowledge of childcare and Yuzuyu's injured heart with the disappearance of her mother, their time together is in for a bumpy ride. Based on the manga by Maki Youko.                Arrivederci~ =D|`|1KajpBdaaa	hehe u caught me in a good mood for listing anime lol >.

ONyrHCSwaa	yeah!!!!!! well I've met Paris Hilton lots and lots of times.... so many times that now she recognizes me now and she's like hey malini what's up! hah but I've seen her at airports before!! so have lots of my cousins it's random haha but it's easy cause the crowds sort of give it away......  by the way YES there are guards and crowds of people wherever there are celebrities.........even the ones that aren't that famous. Like literally, one time when I met Paris Hilton they had to block off an entire street because there were too many people for the cars to even drive up and down the street...... and it was a really long street too.   It's sometimes hard to get to them because of the crowds (and the bodyguards are really bad about letting you go near them so you have to talk to the celebrity and get them to change the guard's minds. haha.) I seriously have bruises from the last time I met Paris Hilton.  People get pretty crazy around any celebrity or at least in my experiences with them.  So be careful. hehe :)  but good luck!!|`|pQBjqMkoaa	i agree with erica    LAX is the hotspot for celebs|`|xQZmk1vKaa	yes there will be a big crowd and also a lot of guards (well it depends on who this person is) i think you would have a high chance of seeing this person considering there is only one airport. expect a load of crazy fans screaming, trust me they will do ANYTHING to get near a celebrity.|`|3omToSXnaa	go to LAX in Californa and just sit there and you will defently see clebrites everywere|`|23be963eb1028d7ae0b0e466b5716e56aa	it depends how famous this celebrity is... maybe you can come closer to him/her if the guards are not that strict... goodluck!|`|AA11332035	Like a few people said, LAX is an easy place to see famous people. The most likely ones are Bradley International Terminal, American Airlines (Terminal 4), and United Airlines (Terminal 7). That's because those are the most popular airlines with 1st class seats. International, because, it's more expensive to fly long distance in a private plane. You also will see famous people flying into the Burbank (Bob Hope) Airport a lot also. So far in LAX & BUR, I've seen Mike Tyson, Rob Thomas, Gene Simmons, Spike Lee, Rodney James Dio, Ted Nugent, Simon LeBon, and so many others, it would take me awhile to remember all of them. Most of them not real famous, and most of them musicians. I've also driven many famous people too, but it's confidential in my line of work.
wX5fOrNGaa	Couple of different answers for this depending on two things:     1.  Comic Shops or Comic Shop Sites That Doesn't Know Obama Is In It - Since it hasn't received much press yet on Ebay and other sites and everyone seems to think Savage Dragon  137 Variant is the 1st Obama comic, you can still find it relatively cheap on some sites (but it's getting much harder).  For example, I bought one a month ago for around $7 at http://www.atomicavenue.com/atomic/Issue...    2.  Comic Shops or Comic Shop Sites That Do Know Obama Is In It - On Ebay, three different auctions went for $100 or more.  I called around some comic shops listed on the Licensable BearTM site and one's that still had it (Bunjee's Comics in Georgia) was selling their copy for $350.00.    Hope this helps.
rZebRJlEaa	I think you might find this site interesting:    www.tzipilivni.co.il    it's her own official website    another good place to search for her videos is youtube...type in tzipilivni2009    by the way...she has a husband, and 2 grown sons...u can see her husband's face on some youtube videos...she even dances in some videos, quite hilarious    Hope this might ease your hunger for Tzipi Livni ;)|`|WU4MHq3aaa	.|`|VKHXlaWVaa	I am absolutely convinced she awaits you right now.

The anime is the only good thing on there except for family guy.|`|v1hCymAEaa	I dont think that is true because if they did a lot of people would get really mad. The only reason I watch Adult Swim is for the anime, I am not a big fan of the comedy shows. I have noticed however that Swim has been pushing the anime back some hours though, but its not going to get cancelled or they would lose a lot of money.      :-P|`|ZJjlcXD4aa	God I hope so that **** sucks....|`|DmXexkZdaa	I hate half the **** they put on. I hope they do keep anime. I heard that same rumor and if it's true, I quit watching the channel. All seriousness, I think they might. According to an Anime megazine I read, Anime isn't doing so well in the US... even if it's popular, the ratings aren't do as well as they should. I assume it has to do with people down loading episodes or buying DVDs.|`|qAfnWKQCaa	For f*ck's sake I hope so. I can't stand that campy jap sh!t.    I hope they drop that weird psychedelic crap that they've got too.    Family Guy, King of the hill, Clerks, The Venture bros., and Robot Chicken is all they need to keep. Cancel everything else.|`|ARRsp216aa	To be honest I have always found their anime line-up to be seriously lacking. I watch most of my shows online so I wont really care either way.|`|szSjOCqqaa	Seriously people? Calling that crap comedy is a disgrace to the genre and comedians everywhere except will ferrell cuz he's just as bad if not worse. I've heard this too and I would seriously like to believe it's not true; however, I fear it's very likely because the anime segments apparently don't bring the ratings that there "comedy" shows get. I believe their viewers are a hybrid of intoxicated pot smoking crack addicts ie will ferrell fans.    For the record Anime is described as Japanese Animation ie Naruto, not American like Family Guy (which I love) or King of the Hill (which I hate).

Study the anime's art (or manga) and try to see how they did it.  Secondly, try watching manga tutorials. I watched some and my manga faces improved considerably =] Just search mark crilley on Youtube. Hes a very good tutor.  Finally, PRACTICE. If you keep drawing your specific characters, eventually you'll get better and better at it.   Oh and don't forget your special weapon; Pencils! w00t!|`|gCIRxhXDaa	theres a person on deviantart that goes by the name of crysa. she has a few good tutorials on things like hair, wings, faces, eyes, how to draw folds in clothing, and the like.  here's a link to her page.|`|ARRsp216aa	Remember the most important thing to help improve your drawing is practice! Tutorials and how-to-draw books only go so far. Like the person above said, the more you practice the easier it will become. Trust me after you draw a certain thing over a long period of time it becomes really easy. But be sure to study the art style you want to draw so you get a feel for how you should draw it.  It won't happen overnight,but after a while you'll get the hang of it. Hope I helped, good luck!

AA11512196	Known for its Space Western theme, Trigun is about a man named " Vash the Stampede" and the two Bernardelli Insurance Society employees who follow him around in order to minimize the damages inevitably caused by his appearance. Most of the damage attributed to Vash is actually caused by bounty hunters in pursuit of the "60,000,000,000$$" (sixty billion "double dollars") bounty on Vash's head for the destruction of the city of July. However, he cannot remember the incident clearly due to his amnesia. Throughout his travels, Vash tries to save lives using non-lethal force. He is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D.

GFhocHr8aa	Well... he's dating you because he wants you, not her, and he ignored her call because he was focusing all his attention on you. A little jealousy is understandable, but unless he shows actual signs of cheating, it's no reason to end the relationship if you're mostly happy together.|`|nxHjSKTTaa	Yes, you are being way too jealous! You can't be like that and expect to keep this relationship. Then he'll have to start hiding all his friends from you and he will come to resent that.|`|B7WIZdglaa	well, although i'd probably be a bit weary of who this girl is and why she is calling my boyfriend.. I think the silent treatment was a bit immature. You need open communication for a relationship to work.. giving the silent treatment is not communicating openly. You should of asked who she was, how he knows her.. and maybe if you all could hang out sometime. Get to know his girly friends, because not only will that show them that he is into you and with you, but it will make you feel better about him talking to them.|`|wZa3qiSbaa	No you shouldn't try to make it work on your own he has to be also willing to make it work as well, I never believe a guy when he say their just friends.... Well  now your his friend and many more , Can't he just give his friend up for the sake of what he has with you?|`|2IBHMk9Naa	I'm a Scorpio and I get jealous quite quickly too, I think you should apologize, it was kinda childish to ignore him and give him the silent treatment! Have a little faith in him, or if you feel he is untrustworthy then don't have such an intimate relationship,then  just be friends!    But scorpios do get jealous!!!!!|`|NUupRBrGaa	According to astrologically not good match girl match and boy is not match so this matching is 50% only|`|LrKCLZF7aa	There are 4 things to look for.  1. If two people form a Grand Trine with each other, no matter what the planets are, they will compliment each others lives.  2. Chiron points the way to your Soul Mate. There are 2 main aspects. Chiron Jupiter and Chiron Neptune. When these planets for a trine, conjunction, parallel or contra-parallel in geocentric or heliocentric charts you are looking at the soul mate aspects.  3. Watch out for dangerous clashes. There are quite a few to look for. The Chiron square Chiron is called the Separate Ways Clash. It is caused by being born about 13 to 18 years apart. Many times people with this aspect will stay together for many years and still end up going their separate ways. A Saturn Juno clash is also very bad. Saturn Chiron is the heartbreak clash. This can be over come and because Chrion rules the family, many times what we see is the source of the heartbreak might be a family member other than the spouse, but many times it comes from the spouse as well.  4. Most astrologers will disagree with this one. Juno doesn't point to marriage. Juno rules the love affair and increases the chance of people becoming intimate but it also rules spells, and as such, fades away with time. It rules marriage without children and children without marriage. But Juno rules the NEED for sex and is the most powerful of the sexual planets.|`|tAaxrqUYaa	YES!    your overacting you little dick!    hes allowed to have other friends besides you. be grateful he didnt pick up the phone. i would've. you seem to nagging and needy tbh. if i were him i would leave you|`|mKfQQRDuaa	Don't Leo your intense Scorpio jealousy, kill the relationship! Leos are devoted and faithful, he won't lie to you.  He has no reason to. Remember Leos live in the spotlight and the planet that represents Leo is the sun, therefore within the light of the sun nothing can be hidden.  Leo is also the eternal child and young children are rarely good liars, or liars at all.  Think about it...kids are often painfully honest and Leo rules children.  Your relationship is likely to be intense, extremely passionate and emotional.  Leo and Scorpio can be faithful to the death and painfully in love and lust with one another.|`|55bffae43f7b7cfbd5b53cdc525c5a75aa	You should ask when the situation is calmed down.

p1EpGJAjaa	I know that she just a had a baby girl with O'Ryan, I don't know if they're married or not.
irSBrZiQaa	You are not alone I love Phillip and I have been counting down the days for his return. The show is not the same without him.     Phillip started to go get delusional he started to think that everyone working for Spaulding was against him. He asked Gus to do background checks on some of the employee's, and he just went crazy. Alan being Alan wanted to protect his company and his grandkids. Phillip became so crazy that he took off with his boys and later wanted Lizzie to come, but she did not want to. Phillip was crazier then ever and vowed that he would make people pay for making him lose Lizzie's love. Later he asked Harley, Beth, Alan and some other people to meet him at company, however when they arrived they would find Phillip dead from a gun shot. later Phillip was declared dead.   Harley was charged with his murder and served time, but the real killer was Alan. After Alan got arrested he tried to tell everyone that Phillip was alive, which he was because Alan set the whole thing up. No one could find Phillip and they sent Alan to a mental hospital. Later it was found out that Phillip was still alive.    As far as his return Bill Lewis is searching for him to help Lizzie. Bill thinks that it takes a Spaulding to fight a Spaulding. I also think that once he comes back beth is going to go into shock...    I hope this helps :)|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Anita is right on the money with her answer.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Thanks for asking and thanks to Anita for the wonderful update!    I had stopped watching Guiding Light years ago and I didn't know what had happened to Phillip either.  I've been watching it now for a couple of months and it's really getting good!    Can't wait until Phillip comes back.  He was always one of my faves.|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	Well it looks like Anita answered it for you lol no need to answer this one :o)|`|f0173000dda40d230a0442e8832073d1aa	Hats off to Anita...give her the points!    I love the GL and while I will drive for hours to see Hamlet, and often sit and read "real" literature I find that this show is a great albeit slightly guilty pleasure..  I don't watch any other soap, but I love, love, love this one!    It nearly killed me when Tammy died, I was crushed when Lizzie thought Sarah was gone...chocked up for Gus.....    I can't wait to see Philip..I only pray that he is the old good Philip and not the horrible maniac he was when he went away.  Can't wait to see Beth, Alan and Rick with him and Lizzie too.

ETIHOWt9aa	Desmond is looking for Faraday's mother at oxford but found out she is in Los Angeles. I also think Ms. Hawking is Faraday's mother.    Rousseau was the woman helping Jin, but it was in the past, the whole time traveling dilemma. She is the French chick from the previous seasons. The one that captured Sayid, warned him about the others,  and the mother of Alex.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Desmond is looking for Daniel's mother.  I think it's Mrs. Hawking.|`|vapIgjE1aa	eloise hawkins is faradays mother. jin, on the other was time traveling with the others on the island and went 16 years in the past. the young woman that was pregnant is danielle rouseaau.(!)|`|8696641a7fa3c84c2678c6fb04a20748aa	Desmond was looking for Daniel Faraday......in last nights episode not his mom.  The lady helping Jin is Danielle - the crazy French Lady.  Eloise Hawkins is Daniels' mom and connected to Charles Whitmore..........she was also the lady that Desmond wanted to buy Penny's ring from and she wouldn't sell it to him....her picture was also on the monk's desk when Desmond left the monastory.  I don't know the connection between them, but Desmond is Daniels' constant and Penny is Desmonds'  Now I'm confused!|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	Danielle Rousseau is the crazy French lady from the first season. The Island has traveled back in time to when the French arrive. In the 1st season, the Lost survivors find Danielle when searching for the radio signal that is repeating a distress call in French. Her child was born and was abducted by the Others and raised by Ben. The child is considered by Ben to be his "daughter" and is killed by the mercenaries from the freighter. Ben vows revenge and is going to kill Widmore's child (Penny)
4JQ71C1caa	They're both amazing with very strong, beautiful voices.   But I'd put my vote on Leona. I loved her album more.|`|6ubffIyWaa	Leona Lewis most defiantly!  Am sorry but who is Jordin Sparks she pooped out of no where!  She just randomly appeared in a Neyo track, he probably used her to make himself look better.  Don't get me wrong Jordin Sparks is a good singer, but is she good enough? No!  Listen to her live and you no what i mean!  Sorry if my comment offends but everyone is entitled to their own opinion and this is mine!|`|yBH8EDsQaa	I think they are both very good singers but Leona's voice gets a bit boring because she always starts quietly and gets louder. I just get bored listening to her songs sometimes and and I don't think her voice is very versatile because it sounds the same all the time. I do think she's quite musical though because she does good versions of other songs. I'd say Jordin Sparks is more like a Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey because she can do more technical vocal skills.|`|cF4zzu0Baa	well  i wud  sai jordin sparkz buty leaona is probz betta cuz she wrked wiv mariah carey  beyonce rihhana ciara and  nicole sherzinger and more|`|P6aieYVIaa	Prefer Jordin Sparks myself she has great power with her voice.  Leona's music sounds too much the same for me.  I appreciate her artistic ability, just not for me.  Jordin every time. :-)|`|0a0c0e6587caf659cbfccb545a4fec1faa	leona lewis is loads better she has a unique voice!|`|bfP8tjPKaa	Jordin Sparks|`|ev353FQMaa	I like both of them but i definitley think Leona's voice is more DEVELOPED.|`|mGvSEY6Saa	i think they are both good, leona lewis is an amazing singer, but so is jordin sparks...  tough call there :)|`|9ZRvPegvaa	Dont get me wrong, Jordin Spark is good but in no way close to Leona Lewis.    Leona is in a class of her own.  She can be compared with the likes of Whitney and Mariah. BUT she is the best singer out of them all to sing live.  When Leona sings live, it is so hauntingly beautiful.  Mariah did not achieve that on Xfactor (but she may have been better when she was younger).    Leona has totally amazed me. Especially with the ballads.|`|pN3Q4IMOaa	Leona defo :) buuh yea jordin sparks is also very good|`|vN6J6nELaa	I like Leona Lewis, but Jordin Sparks said she wanted to sing with Leona, and they might collaborate on each other albums this year. I love both, but Leona is my favorite. =]|`|1sP3dJlnaa	Leona is better.|`|p1todZkkaa	my votes on Leona,just cause her voice's the most beautiful..jordin's voice are more to the pop acts..so both are nt bad atually|`|5pixuieFaa	T.B.H.I think Leona is a better singer.|`|5caec993eac9c99e4343f9ba6a23999caa	i like both 2  but i prefer jordin

JqhQSjQFaa	The Movies Hilarious.........and yes he was meant to be retarded|`|yqe0I5zpaa	It's a movie! The retard, racist, homosexual jokes were crude and offesive, but c'mon it is a movie!!!! If your uptight you shouldn't be seeing an movie Rated R for pervasive language, violent content, drug content and sexual references and that has a white actor in a black face, if your uptight do not see the film.|`|m6CIhrgqaa	That kid is in the Tropic Thunder special features & his character isn't mentally disabled, he is just overweight, lazy & a bit dopey ( Kinda like Jake from Two & A Half Men.)|`|n9fmwnawaa	I didn't watch the movie. I went to the theatre to see another movie the day Tropic Thunder opened and there were some af/am's picketing the theatre because of this movie and the part Robert Downey Jr played. They only picketed that day. If I had been goint to see that movie, I would have chosen not to, because I am a white chick and don't like to go against a crowd.|`|DeuKCARsaa	yes...but having the gay black rapper balanced it out..he didnt let anything slide|`|urmhRHwxaa	People misunderstand the film.  Stiller's character's role as "Simple Jack" is not poking fun at retarded people, it's making fun of actors who cynically take such roles because they know they're showy and good for winning awards.  Stiller's character took the role simply so he could have a shot at winning an Oscar, a la Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"), Sean Penn ("I Am Sam"), and Cliff Robertson ("Charly").      It also satirizes films like "Forrest Gump" that pass off simple aphorisms ("Life is like a box of chocolates", "Stupid is as stupid does") as wisdom.  In the film, Simple Jack can talk to animals and his mental retardation is seen as a savant-like "gift", which implies that mentally challenged people are somehow special or have supernatural traits that "make up" for their slow thinking.    People reacted to the fact that the word "retard" was used and, as usual, showed that most people aren't bright enough to understand satire, or most humor beyond Adam Sandler beating someone up.
Klw3Ke3Haa	I am not sure but you can probably try a blog site or use the power of google to find plenty of useful and helpful sites for you to use. Good Luck!|`|NsSzHsq3aa	I would go with a character from the current most popular anime. I went to New York Anime Fest with my friends and we did a group cosplay of Tengen Toppan Gurren Lagann and we had a great time because they had some Gurren Lagann panels and the voice actor Steve Blum was there. I don't have a favorite yet, but I like costumes with good mobility (to dance in!), maybe a cool looking prop =3, and recognizable by the majority. I've also always wanted to cosplay the kitty from Trigun x]

tuATxHsVaa	It's Beethoven's 5th Symphony. However, this is a disco version called "A Fifth of Beethoven." It's by Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band. It came out in 1976 and was really famous in discos.     Here is a recording of some guy playing the record it was on:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxS0gO_-T...    You can buy the album "Best of Walter Murphy" and it's on there:    http://www.amazon.com/Best-Walter-Murphy...    By the by, this question doesn't belong here in "classical"

VhHVhdnzaa	Do = C  Re = D  Mi = E  Fa = F  Sol = G  La = A  Si = B|`|8cDd70dSaa	Those aren't chords, and they aren't in Spanish. That's like in The Sound of Music...Do Re Me Fa So La Ti Do...the notes of the scale, but it doesn't specify what scale. There's really no way to tell what they were going for from this.|`|wMVOg8dIaa	Those are syllables used in Solfge (a technique for the teaching of sight-singing in which each note of the score is sung to a special syllable, called a solfge syllable.     In the major Romance languages (like Spanish), the syllables Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and Si are used to name notes the same way that the letters C, D, E, F, G, A, and B are used to name notes in English. This system is called "fixed do."    So:    Do    -   C    Re    -   D    Mi    -   E    Fa    -   F    Sol   -   G    La    -   A    Si    -    B|`|BuQoNtGOaa	They are notes from the major scale, which note depends on what key your in.

NQumSrA3aa	LOL!  I find the remix very "dancey".      And, I don't think he will respond to it unless he absolutely has to... as in, he's at the Terminator premiere and some annoying interviewer won't let it go.  And even then, he will say something very general, but apologetic.    I've been a fan of his for a while and he's an INTENSELY private person... his own daughter's name isn't even used in the press.  He gave them a fake name to protect HER privacy.  So I just highly doubt he will revisit this whole thing on his own.    EDIT:  I saw this today and thought of your question:  http://justjared.buzznet.com/2009/02/06/...  Apparently, he didn't say anything about the remix, though.|`|JIvuToXVaa	He would probably swear|`|mi7cxYeMaa	I think he'd probably just laugh at it, or throw another fit    but i think he would just laugh...a lot
d9305427a9af00631d5b9b86b24d4d9aaa	Yes he called KROQ in the morning, and expressed his regret for what he did and explained the context for it. He said he appreciated them poking fun at the situation.|`|lcXs249aaa	..no i dont think so
urmhRHwxaa	I doubt it, since it's making fun of his outburst and also bringing more attention to it.      My guess is that he probably wishes his outburst was not made public, but could care less otherwise.  He's a wealthy, talented, and popular international star, so he can do almost anything he wants, and he knows it.|`|HQMb14hUaa	just wait till next month when he PMS again|`|t6k3yoNdaa	Lmao. I could not stop laughing at the remix, and the actual one! Poor Christian.    http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedishr...
BCu8rER4aa	i can only agree w/ you w/ jacob!|`|DeuKCARsaa	wow...i didnt even think about anna for bella...but thats almost perfect!    But the age could be a problem.    I think Jacob is perfect...but i dont think edward is cute enough|`|3ca554b994e514508242f36d37077a74aa	The guy and girl who play Edward and Bella in the movie aren't what I  ever pictured. Honestly, I don't think I could find actors or actresses to play how I have imagined the characters in my head. I know what they look like to me, but I just can't explain it. I like the girls you chose for Alice and Bella, but I think Blakely looks too young to play Renee and Meyer isn't ridiculously beautiful enough. =)|`|uDsACcFCaa	i think they shouldve used Steven Strait in the second movie.    your picks for alice rosalie and carlise are definately better.    Rachel Blakely to me looks like tanya from the denali clan|`|Z4LmvBJnaa	i guess that sounds like a possible cast, wow good job picking it out!|`|GK3wBfTHaa	See those actors maybe for adult versions of Alice, Edward, etc but that ain't ever happening so your choices, though not bad, are a little too old for the characters.     Bella, I am okay with there choice. I see Anna too much as Sookie right now to think she could play Bella. Carlisle, well he is suppose to be young and beautiful and John ain't either...to me. So their choose is fine to me. Alice character I think is fine for now. Edward, though I didn't picture Robert Pattinson, is not such a big deal for me.    For Jacob, I never thought about Steven. He would be good. But I keep seeing Jared Padalecki (http://www.farandulista.com/wp-content/u... - http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1230869504/n... as Jacob after the transformation. I like Taylor but he is just not big enough to me. Jared is already 6'4.     Rosalie, seems like a good choice for Laura Ramsey. Or even AnnaLynn McCord being Rosalie is fine. She is pretty and bitchy all at once. Anyone really would be better then Nikki. Because honestly I DON'T see Nikki Reed that pretty enough to be Rosalie. Kinda ruined it for me.|`|sMc5rrtFaa	I haven't seen the movie yet but from the screenshots and clips I've seen I agree that Nikki doesn't look like I imagined Rosalie.I don't think that Anna has the dramatic look that Kristen has.I do like Jonathan Rhys Meyers but he is too old to pull off Edward and from pictures and clips I like Robert as Edward.I also like Ashley as Alice so for a majority I agree with the casting.
AA12390047	Bikini girl made a big fool of herself and didn't make the cut.  It's narrowed down to 36 now.

I don't think i could have watched much more of her posing for the camera and all that kissing on Ryan.  She should have tried out for a porn movie....|`|AA12223250	No thank God!!! She is gone!  It was group night lots of drama and some really good performances as well.|`|J8rQh79Naa	hehehe no she didnt make it but i wish people would quit crying so much gah it ifs not the end of the world.|`|eGI5s8R5aa	Praise the Lord and Hallelujah, Bikini girl is finally gone. It REALLY pissed me off that she made it as far as she did. We all know it was only because she showed up in skimpy clothes.     Of course she thought that Cara--the new judge--didn't like her b/c she was "jealous" of her. Jealous of what??? I hate when girls like her use that tired phrase. Honey, sometimes folks don't like you b/c you're a B*TCH and jealousy has nothing to do with it. I was too glad to see her go!|`|LLNlyaFaaa	YAY!!! she's gone man i was so so so happy when i saw her leave man se was honestly so so FAKE

AA11828439	Haters are losers.
vHxauOyeaa	yeah I guess you could... it depends... like you might not be able to use a strap without moving the hooks...   might have an awkward cutaway...   might have all of the tuners might be on the wrong side.   all in all it doesn't matter because it is just for fun so I say do it.    btw string setup would go from E-A-D-G-B-e if you are looking at the fretboard from left to right in that order... to e-B-G-D-A-E and this would be by looking at it from the same angle. you should probably buy new strings... and you will be playing it so that the big E is the string closest to your chin/face/chest whatever is above the body of the guitar.|`|jaAolejUaa	yes, you rearrange the strings|`|POriIGJtaa	Jimmi Hendrix did|`|Nbozr7Dcaa	Play it upside down.  That's what I do|`|suLTN10laa	If the curvature of the guitar is the same on either side, yes, if not you still can, but it will be uncomfortable.  Just reverse the strings.  Take them all off, flip the guitar and put the thickest E string on top and work your way down to the thinnest E...  If you think you can't remember which is which label them before you take them off   you can fold a piece of scotch tape over it and number them  Good luck!|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Play in front of a mirror.  Don't look at the guitar, only the reflection.    Just kidding.|`|bhgoblhNaa	Just flip it over kinda like Jimmy Hendrix did.|`|SYYO3oozaa	Yup.  Just take out the strings and pegs and switch them up.|`|wUkU3HVwaa	yeah i do, i think it's just the strings that are just set up the wrong way but it's fine for me :)|`|6gGcF8C5aa	just restring it, put the strings in the opposite order|`|HobgsxXCaa	No, The bracing on the head is different, the base side has more,or heavier or different bracing depending on the manufacturer.|`|GWr2hJXdaa	You would need to flip the guitar and the nut upside down. Depending on the guitar you may meed to install a left handed bridge.

KkZE2NDYaa	If you are certain it is not something loose or vibrating in the body, headstock, etc., it is probably "fret buzz". Try raising the offending strings or increase the bow of the neck. I am not familiar with your model of bass so I don't know how hard it is to change the bow. I have a Kubicki Factor and it can fussy about temp. and humidity but it is easy to adjust myself. If you have to spend the bucks to take it to the shop, ask specific questions about what was wrong and what they did so next time, maybe you can do it yourself.
AA11899483	this is what i would do, do not have any contact with him untill the divorce is over, and tell him that too. once it is over, ask him what he wants and why. how well do you really know him? like how he is as a person? do you trust him to tell him things about you? if so then start as friends, get to know him more untill you are very sure of him. us scorpios have a habit, of when we are going through a radical change, we isolate oursleves, cut ourselves out, and when we are ready to face whats coming our way, we get up and take it on. maybe he feels ready for you, but are you ready for him, make everthing clear to him, like where you stand. ask him the same. what exactly is it he wants. if you want him, tell him, but law down some things you want over and done with before anything between you two starts. and ask him the same. but anyways, be careful, scorpios do tend to keep some things in, we are very guarded, even if we seem open.     best of luck between you 2, if you decide its what you want. :)|`|y4Nc0W4Kaa	wow I hope for your sake he divorces because Im a scorpio and my wifes a Libra and though we have major differences she is a hopeless romantic and I love to create romance for her with my depth of creativity remember if you can scorps can be secretive and not as extroverted as librans we have had pretty heated disagreements but we both shoot from the heart and I couldnt ask for a better wife ps....weve been together 20 years now

He's been through a lot too. However, I think he has more going on inside than he's letting people know.    Scott's hot though but doesn't get that much air time to let his personality show!    And JD gets on my nerves sometimes, especially when he's drunk! He just threw Katelyn right under the bus. and Devyn too!

2vzj65Kfaa	Oh man, I LOVE that album!    3 O'clock Blues especially!

8rTAfF1maa	brendon's butt is hot!    i agree, chuck bass is insane. yet he's still cute.|`|j999KYH5aa	Chuck Bass might be insane - but he's sexy~! ^^|`|VFc9leFmaa	I can only answer the first question...oh hell yes I love his *** yay =)
fguyiSIjaa	Cause that's what it says on the box. And what it was originally called in the US too.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Dinne...    To me, macaroni and cheese is the casserole my mom makes with real cheese sauce and onions and bread crumbs to make the top crunchy. Yummmm.|`|EEzeeGhLaa	Because they're canadian.|`|AA10021017	its all in the packaging.....ehh!!!|`|SBjV8GlFaa	Because Kraft does it best? Maybe.|`|Htoc2AISaa	haha.  im canadian n i used to call it that, until i moved to the states n everyone gave me weird looks so now i call it mac n cheese.  lol, but idk why everyone calls it that.|`|klhFMdCgaa	hey, i'm canadian and I call macaroni and cheese mac and cheese, not kraft dinner. i loathe k.d.|`|nbsj8Hbqaa	One of the brands that make macaroni-cheese is called "Kraft".   I guess it just caught on.|`|TEhITkeIaa	Probably the same reason why they call cow @ss; Rump Roast|`|WhGl6TNWaa	well its the same as how where i live we call top ramen noodles "top ramen" and it sounds like rah-men and in eastern parts of the US they call them "ramen noodles" and it sounds like ray-mon  i guess it's just where you live and what everyone around you calls it|`|btEUXC62aa	because macaroni cheese is the work of the devil!!     and thats what the witches made from there cauldron     -x-|`|zTQaREymaa	Because that's what it is.|`|utGddhnVaa	why take the effort to say macaroni and cheese when you can just say KD. It's cause we're hell smart.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Having lived in Canada, I should know; but I would get the Metro-Richelieu brand lol .. and besides in Quebec, where I lived, I would just call it "macaroni" but I will star this and perhaps friends of mine still living up north can shed some light on the issue.|`|XDfrSfrvaa	cause it's a fancy dinner to them|`|pfm0wcEIaa	Because it is shorter...|`|hNa5oHxQaa	because mac & cheese is American food and they wanna make it sound less American.  Or maybe they know it by brand name.  Just like we call Cotton swabs "Q tips"  or Swim briefs "Speedos"  or Facial tissues "Kleenexes"|`|QEqGukjZaa	kraft is good.yum yum. what ever they call it..its tasty|`|P8uh4joQaa	it sounds fancier|`|AA10916001	They just call the general thing by the brand name: "Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner" is mac & cheese.    Kind-of like how we call a tissue a "Kleenex" or all large garbage bins "Dumpster"|`|AA10796061	No, it's not because it sounds fancier. Why do we say "kleenex"? Or tampax? Same thing. To Canadians, the two are synonomous, that's all.|`|kTc3bfrRaa	CaUSE   KRAFT  is a  BIG  employer keeping alot of canadians employed!!..   and   ..  besides..  Mac n cheese  just  dont sound right!!..|`|6UlOorwMaa	you're asking why Canadians do what they do?  lol|`|UCO7blmKaa	i dont know but u just gave me an idea of what to eat right noqw!!! YUMMY!!! im gonna have me some "KRAFT BREAKFAST"|`|v0BCIQpnaa	KD is the king of Mac & Cheeze!  (Our house calls it KD, and yes, I am Canadian)!  It is common to use a poplular brand name to identify a product.    Kleenex  = facial tissue  Skidoo    = Snowmobile  Kotex     = femine hygiene product.  Pamper  = diaper  Coke      = cola or soda    There are many others that don't come to mind at the moment.    Bri

Then after I had traveled to Sichuan  province and lived with a judge who sentences people to death etc. and learned kung fu of a naked woman and gone to a sci-fi convention where I met my favorite cartoonist Neil Gaiman and some astronauts I went back to Beijing and took some photographs where I placed my self in such a perspective that my face blocked out Chairman Mao's face in the background on the forbidden palace. At the time I knew only a little of what had happened there. But recently I came across this video of the unknown rebel. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOPbt3hs3...|`|n7vsfdplaa	Nope I don't even know where that is lol|`|tg4K6bIYaa	no|`|kTc3bfrRaa	yes!..  its  a   very  historic  and  frightening place!!    very weird  vibes  there!|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	The closest I've been is Hong Kong|`|186deac21531919b3fa042717df297e7aa	yes indeed I have xxx
ff8f1f5e6ae77b2318640fce7787a746aa	I'm w/ you RED. It is exactly what I do.?|`|OikNR8Ufaa	I do sometimes. I feel a lot of questions deserve sarcastic, rude comments however, there may be children on here (which there shouldn't be) but there is also a lot of idiots. Usually I try to be nice though :)|`|8PhOCtcZaa	Yes, it's not right for minors to read things that aren't appropriate for they're age group. It makes them lose respect for the right of free speech and their own message|`|kTc3bfrRaa	i dont bother!|`|CApnEZ83aa	I do that.  I agree with you.  If they cannot write anything nice, then I thumbs down.  Doesn't anyone remember what their  Mom taught them?  "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."|`|2OILdfw8aa	i dont because im only level one haa :)|`|t5MwoKokaa	'answers that use unfit language'  have 'U' read the question 'U' wrote?|`|AlocuXIFaa	Oh @ %* No!!!|`|tGZqtBNLaa	I have never asked a question but if i did im sure I would .|`|V2r0HRKjaa	I don't thumbs up or down the answer I just select best answer. Well, the answers are like incredibly rude then I will.|`|AA11641349	No I don't.  People are entitled to their opinions.  Freedom of speech baby.  What are you the YA police?  And, about the children, their parents are responsible for what they do, if they don't want them on here, they should watch them more closely.  It's not your job.|`|GTsKitahaa	I give thumbs up for all of my answers.  If someone takes the time to answer my question, I give them a thumbs up, even if I don't agree with the answer.  Only on one occasion did I skip a thumbs up and that was because the answer did not pertain to the question, the person was just being ignorant.  But I never thumbs down anyone that answers my questions.|`|SBjV8GlFaa	No, never go back. Just forward.|`|f1FRCSdTaa	no but i do go back and see if i got any thumbs up or down|`|TEhITkeIaa	Me too! I've realize a long time ago that some of these people have had a family member die right after saying;"Hey! watch this!"|`|GiHOnv54aa	I don't do thumbs down unless they're really rude. If it's just because I don't agree with it, I won't give it thumbs down for something small  X|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.I do not give thumbs down only up.If I do not like an answer I leave it alone.If is against the rules or talking about anther member I report it.|`|jaAolejUaa	yes, i do.. thats the entire point of being allowed to rate.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	I usually don't thumb down an opinion. If he/she disagrees that's fine. If there is rudeness, it depends on the severity. I usually give thumbs up to everyone so by just ignoring it, I feel I made a statement. As far as vulgar or insensitive to minors answers. If it is something that I feel is inappropriate or illegal, I report it. That goes for any Q&A, not just mine. I recenlt saw a person talking about suicide and some nut egged him on. Insanity, inhumanity gets reported.|`|XTExSyv5aa	Ew no I have better things to do, I also guess you report users all the time|`|mggll8dRaa	Never Happened....!!|`|AA11656632	Yes, I hate sarcastic answers|`|HgRYP3cJaa	I thumbs  down for stupid answers, esp if they don't relate to the question.  Thumbs up for good ideas or answers.    As far as language goes 'the children' are the ones using it, so I don't bother with that.  They hear worse on the playground.    And I'm a sarcastic person, so it comes naturally to me.  What may seem sarcastic to you, may not be meant that way and may not have been taken that way.    In my opinion you spend too much time worrying about the unimportant things.|`|THuplVHpaa	I do. That's the best part is going back and rating the idiots.|`|k2yy6tlUaa	yea same n the good answers that are really usefull i give a thumbs up :D|`|jJAENrvUaa	yes also if they just say "so and so is right"    or if every answer has a thumbs down except for one then i thumbs down that one because i figure that's the person who rated everyone down--gotta even things up...
GqHHVzf0aa	Apparently, the creators just decided that the story is over. There have been RUMORS that it will come back on, but as far as we know now, it is over. At the comic con, Mike DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko announced that is officialy over. It's really sad, because it's the best show ever. There is a live-action movie coming out in 2010, but it's just going to be a retelling of the first season. Well, hope this helped!|`|bHaAFcoPaa	They ended the story. Aang fought and defeated the fire lord and saved the day|`|nx2SyAR8aa	not enough  viewers.
sfHGnvxzaa	I would consider it as a sign that my partner would no longer want to be with me, and is just using her detached life as an excuse to break up.    The reason I say this, is because it sounds like something I would do.|`|AA11899483	well first of all id be devastated if that was the reason. well if it seemed they didnt "need" to get their life back together il be suspicious and lay down where i am, and why they cant include me into supporting them through their life>> i always want to support my partner, through good or bad times. but if i knew they were going through some hard times, i'd still want to support them, i know some people can go through life on their own, but some can't. i want to be my partners backbone. but lets say they didnt want a committed relationship,  il always be there as a friend to help out whenever they needed something. i will never desert the ones i love. even if they dont want me. unless they hurt me intentionally, well, then thats another story. but overall, il wait for my love.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	I imagine that any person would wonder why you need to be alone in order to get your life together. Seems like a convenient excuse to get away from your partner.  As a Cancer with a Scorpio moon, I would be extremely hurt and automatically assume that you just didn't want to be with me anymore and were using your life as an excuse. When you love someone, you can lean on them while you're trying to get your life together. Why do you need to seperate? Time alone now and then is one thing...there is no need to cut the person out of your life if you love them.|`|cE9QIMNiaa	wow that sounds like whats going on with me except i'm the scorpio and i'm the one who needs space to figure sh*t out...    but if that were me, i'd be really really sad and upset.  almost distraught...i don't handle the bad news well.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	what can u do...nothing.  let me have her time off to get herself together.  no point in trying to stay in a relation ship where one person is not happy.
2vUOqAikaa	I choose to believe that there's always hope. It is my "hope" that things will get better. It is my hope.|`|WXAoSr49aa	WORRYING.|`|HQMb14hUaa	we will be invaded by the norse gods|`|CApnEZ83aa	I have faith that this year is going to be a great year!|`|zTQaREymaa	Different year, same crap.|`|kTc3bfrRaa	the  U.S. debt.. will  hit   QuaTRILLIONS!!...  lol..      no   really!!  my   feelings  have  all  but  gone  numb!!|`|212FfV3faa	i think that it cannot get worse than this year  so it will be a better year|`|tGZqtBNLaa	I think it will get better at some point may not be this year tho|`|TEhITkeIaa	I believe everything is always OK in the end. And if it's not OK,then it's probably not the end yet! But just in case,Remember to first pillage,then you burn.|`|QWMPWia4aa	Optimistic, for a change!|`|3yNh5jO8aa	I believe they will get better!

Maybe I have to listen to it again.
6fxr3VBGaa	Sell    edit: but on the real, not everyone can have the first album with the best beats EVER made Premo, Q-Tip, Large Pro. And AZ started that Life's a B*tch shyt and Nas is still riding that line. "life called bytch i pimped her"  "god forbid that bytch divorce me" who's metaphor was that    Doe or Die lyrically says some deep shyt compared with illmatic it is close if not as deep.     Plus AZ has that concentration of rhymes and word play like on rather unique that is just crazy|`|gUYcVXMTaa	LOL I saw this question coming      Sell With out a doubt!!!  There is now way AZ is Better than NAS.  I always though NAS was better than AZ anyways!!!!  He was the best out of that whole "Firm" thing they had going!  Nas was the only one to make it out and still be in the game today!  That should tell you right there!|`|aJfBtT9iaa	i wonder where u got that from lol    Sell, doe or die wasnt as good as illmatic|`|DDmFQU7raa	Sell. Remember it was NaS that was discovered first.|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	LMAO at poor man's anything!  That term cracks me up.|`|T3X7Aci4aa	Sell. If AZ dropped an album first, nobody would have known who he was until they heard him on a Nas album any way, so it wouldn't really matter.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	I'm gonna have to sell.|`|9wUrbqT3aa	Sell....    The proof is in the track record.  NaS career shows that he couldn't be second fiddle to anyone.    "Illmatic" was a classic album with or without AZ verses.    AZ is a dope MC.. but he would of been able to crawl out of NaS shadow if the statement at hand was true|`|bribxhsdaa	.......Go into my Q about why you think (insert rapper here) is great and read the last additional detail.     Sell..That implies that Doe Or Die is a better album than Illmatic and AZ is a better MC than NaS.     As far as moronic hip hop related statements go,  That's has gotta be up there with:    "If Tupac was so good, How come he got shot?"    "Is Immortal technique Nas's brother?"    "Cypress Hill are like a rock band who never made it"    and    "All i'm saying is, If Lil Wayne isn't the best rapper alive. Who is?"|`|oMYGtqubaa	SELL!!!    It doesn't matter WHO would've dropped first...   I think folks would've been like  AZ is nice.. but Nas is better.   He is just THAT GOOD!|`|q4XUy0Duaa	Sell, but I think more people would have given AZ the credit he deserves.  Illmatic would have been a dope album regardless of when it dropped.  For some reason, there's never any hype around AZ.  I know a lot of people who would even take Cormega over him.  I think most people slept on AZ's solo work and then really heard him on The Firm for the first time, but it was hard to shine in The Firm, because every member was nice.  Maybe if he would have hooked up with Noreaga as a group, people would give him his props, because I think Capone gets a lot more credit than AZ just because he always stands out every track.  Same way Inspectah Deck was always overlooked in Wu, but a guy like Juvenile stood out when they had that Cash Money click.|`|cPcDii15aa	Sell, AZ hot, but Nas brings sumthin else to the table. I think Nas would have always been more successful at touching the hearts of the streets.    But then again, this could just be my subjective thinking...
oFv3v9Oeaa	No...the scenes of him slicing up the Korean Manicurist into a sushi platter were horrific and terrifying. It was the pedicure scene that watered it down....(who knew Kruger was ticklish)|`|XzksDeE3aa	I don't really think that any nightmare on elm st. movies were scary.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	no, but it would have been even stranger|`|HELfs3uhaa	Get naked Dallas...  then I'll manicure you....  He he he.....|`|YKbiJADQaa	No way, those movies sucked monkey balls|`|xqan4ChSaa	u r hot and pretty and that wud b creepy if i saw freddy in a salon|`|WmMZQcg3aa	Was he gay?|`|blbd7e1Qaa	Noo... Freddy was just one ridiculous old perv pedophile...    I was waiting to see John Rambo to appear to scene, taking a thermobaric bomb, dropping it to Elm Street.., and barbecuing Freddie once again...|`|kTc3bfrRaa	your  scaring  me!!!|`|WhGl6TNWaa	lol  i'm leaning towards no|`|iaeRlfk5aa	Well I would not find that scary.. I would find that actually pretty funny and hard to believe haha|`|vADPYe1Haa	NO!!! Wouldn't have been as scary! Freddy Kruger was the best Scary Movies though...|`|0154e31673244b2bea94b54516ec675aaa	it would make him even scarier knowing he is out gossiping at the salon if you ask me|`|tGIuJ8UDaa	mabey who knows but they should do that|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	It would have been funnier if he was getting a facial.|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	no it wouldnt be as scary|`|dDDAbqqhaa	I still find it amazing that people find the Nightmare on elm street films scary|`|6pk6HnuSaa	no - thats a scary image in itself ?    visualize freddy sitting there - it's still pretty creepy|`|cj7sSPZEaa	That would have made the movies a little unrealistic don't you think?  It's more realistic that a guy can appear in your dreams and slice you into pieces until you pull him out of your dream when you wake up!  It's also realistic that Johny Depp's blood came gushing out of the bed.|`|zyTrMeovaa	Another scary movie answer for you.     I think Freddy always had a great sense of  humor to him. I could see him manicure. Throw in a massage and a facial (he needed one of those) as well.
h1IYS0dbaa	Metropolis (Restored Authorized Edition)    You'll find it on amazon.    Last year (after the release of this DVD) a copy was found in Buenos Aires in Argentina with previously unseen scenes. As you might know, some parts of the movie were lost. The copy from Buenos Aires is a complete one. However, you'll have to wait for a DVD issue of that one. It will take a long time until it's restored.    http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/jul/...

There's so many classic covers that have become my favorites over the years. Everything by Roger Dean was brilliant; Yes, Budgie, Paladin, Gentle Giant, Uriah Heep, Gravy Train, Gun, Atomic Rooster, Greenslade, Babe Ruth, Asia, Clear Blue Sky, Ramases, Osibisa, etc, etc. His water colours were fantastic. Here's some of Rogers work...click on each image to enlarge:  http://entertainment.webshots.com/album/...  The boys at Hipgnosis did some great stuff as well; Pink Floyd, Edgar Broughton Band, Nice, Toe Fat, Trees, UFO, Montrose, 10 CC, Wishbone Ash, The Scorpions, Brand X, Led Zeppelin, etc.     Here's a few 'Hipgnosis' classics.

The Scorpions cover was altered for US release, and in it's place was a very plain looking cover with a drawing of a scorpion. In the case of Toe Fat, the naked woman with a toe for a head was airbrushed out, and in her place was a sheep! LOL  UK 'Toe Fat' cover with naked toe headed woman:  http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/t...  Altered US 'Toe Fat' cover with sheep:  http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/t...  German/UK Scorpions 'Lovedrive' cover:  http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/s...  Altered US Scorpions 'Lovedrive' cover:  http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/s...     Hawkwinds 'Space Ritual' fold out Poster cover was really cool. It was designed by Colin Fulcher aka 'Barney Bubbles', a Hawkwind alumni and graphic arts designer.  Then there was the Krautrock band Frumpy, and their 'All Will Be Changed' LP cover. It featured a cool plastic outer sleeve, that when slid across the gatefold cover, it appeared as though the artwork on the inside was moving.  The 'Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band' also achieved a similar effect with their 'Tadpoles' LP cover. When the inner sleeve was removed, the eyes on the band members on the front cover appeared to move as the sleeve slid outward:  http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/t...  Led Zeppelin 3 was cool with it's rotating dial:  http://img185.imageshack.us/img185/8634/...  Deep Purples 'In Rock' is a classic, and shocked many people upon it's release: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en...  Or how about the 1968 release of the Mothers of Invention', 'Were Only In It For The Money', mocking the Beatles 'Sgt Pepper':  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We're_Only_...  http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/f...  Funkadelic's 'Maggot Brain' was pretty wild:  http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/f...  The Mothers of Inventions 'Weasels Ripped My Flesh' (Neon Park) is a stand out for sure:  http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/f...  Of course Alice Cooper should be mentioned as well. His 'Schools Out' album with the folding school desk cover, and the girls panties wrapped around it was quite original...can't find a pic with the panties...sorry:  http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/46647...   Or how about Cheech and Chongs 'Big Bambu', complete with giant rolling paper...  Outer sleeve:  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en...  Inner sleeve with rolling paper:  http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1420/1139...    My absolute favorite is the Edgar Broughton Bands self titled album from 1971, graphic artwork by 'Hipgnosis'. It depicted a meat locker full of hanging hind quarters, but if you look closely you'll see a naked man hanging by his ankles amongst the beef:  http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/e...  Oh, check out Roger Deans album cover artwork books if you can find them(maybe in a used book store). Also the book titled 'Album Cover Album' is great too, though it's been out of print for close to 30 years, I still see it in used book stores from time to time. It's a compilation of album cover art edited by Roger Dean and Hipgnosis. It has everything from great jazz covers, 60's psych, 70s prog, etc. The best book in my opinion on the subject.  The Hipgnosis book titled 'Walk Away Rene' is incredible too!  Another really |`|0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	Wow Smiley...what an answer!     I think I have two very favorite ones.

You think their fans are stupid because their fans are supposed to be tweenaged caucasian girls from ages of 10 to 12. They still watch the Disney Channel and try hard to follow trends.

h1IYS0dbaa	You can't watch such an old movie in sites such as watchmovies.    Sometimes, old movies like this can be found on Youtube but in this case it's not there sorry.    I've checked amazon and found only books on this subject, which means that a DVD of this film doesn't exist.    The only way to see this film is to find it in a library. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it in the Library Of Congress.     I would suggest to go to your local library and make an extensive search there.|`|sjD26raeaa	I looked and do not believe it's on dvd or video sorry  but here is a site about info on it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balto%27s_R...  http://www.baltostruestory.com/  and i looked and it's not available online either sorry  here http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1037970/   did you know balto plays himself in that movie that was made the same year that the medicine race to nome was    this guy says he has it http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byform/ma...  and contact http://www.iditarod.com/aboutus/contactu... and ask them- if anyone would have it they would or know where to get it    sol lesser http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/sol...    another thing to do is see if it will be on tv and record it- like amc tmc channels- i checked they don't have it listed    another thing is to go here to imdb http://amazon.imdb.com/title/tt1037970/  and join and add a comment that you want it on dvd or vhs and maybe someone will comment on that and know how to obtain it.

4YmB7q5jaa	hes talking about how he is different from other rappers and how he has his own style|`|mAV5MJQnaa	You can listen the clip on imeem, I am not sure if its freestyle, maybe he wrote it down, but it sounds like rap and hip hop.|`|z5Wxwtrfaa	How is T.I different from all the other rappers? Just because he has a pretty face? His sound is just more pop hip hop.|`|fff5a37756aff5f36e5a8cbdcad5c867aa	Dawg dat was a freestyle. I think he freestyled a couple things on dat album. Hes talkin bout how theres all these fake rappas in industry nd how he jus keeps it real. Dude it was nice freestyle tho.
4YmB7q5jaa	yes, he reflects his problems from prison and about what he been through|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Thats just the name of the album, I am not sure if it was for his honor or something....|`|z5Wxwtrfaa	How he rose to the top...paper trail...he used to write his lyrics on paper....now he says he memorizes them...wow....|`|aQjl8niPaa	I would rate it a 10 out of 10. He went back to his I'm Serious days, its a very hot album. He is basically talking about why he had bought those machine guns, why he felt like he needed them. He talks about how to act in a club, dont get into it with people. The song with Justin Timberlake addresses that, its called "dead and gone" He did not write it in honor of his prison trail, but he just wants people to get a glimpse of what he is feeling and how he was feeling. Why he made the dumb decisions that he did, thats all. He talks about his best friend Philant Johnson being gunned down right in front of him, that happened in Ohio, this is what made him pay over 500K for security and buy machine guns, he was thinking someone was coming after him.|`|fff5a37756aff5f36e5a8cbdcad5c867aa	Well 4 starters the album was great, my favorite album of 2008. I give it a 10 because every song was banger and I could relate 2 all of them. Now I feel Tip made this album 2 set the record straight on alot of issues that he's been facing lately. On track 3 ready for wateva he talks about how he feels about going 2 jail on gun charges. But track 11 (Every chance I get) he completly dissed shawty low (who sucks anyways...lol.) On This album he put it all out there and spoke the truth and kept it real 100%. For Tip this album was more personal. Like I said easily this album gets a 10. Tip truly proves that he is the KING!

AA11668206	Well I have mixed feelings about the choice of Kristen Stewart as Bella. I agree I kinda saw her being more of a softer character than Kristen made her out to be. She is supposed to be relateable to any average girl, but I don't think that means coming off as "hard" as she did. I will say that I think Kristen did a pretty good job of making Bella appear fragile, but would it kill her to smile? I mean I know there are some dark themes to the Twilight saga, but personally its hard for me to relate to a person who gets so closed off from other people. Mike and the others, although at times kind of immature in the movie, they were trying to be friendly to her for being the new girl and she kind of shrugged them off. So bottom line, I agree with your feelings about her as Bella, and a lot of people I know feel the same as well.|`|DsU99BT8aa	They should have had someone else for Bella, her voice sounds way different then I imagined it would be. You're right.|`|9X5YK5Dqaa	She annoys me, she cannot act, she ruined the film for me as I waited 6 months for the movie.    She ruined the WHOLE film. She cannot act! Thank you for putting this question up I would have.|`|QrX99Ye8aa	I agree!  In some parts of the movie Kristen sounds like a boy and that is not Bella. I wouldnt have a Disney person in it but someone who really acts and looks like Bella Swan!|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	I agree. Kristen seems a bit too tough for the role. She's a lovely talented girl but is very tom-boyish. But a lot of people love her as Bella, so I guess it was a good choice. I personally would have preferred a different person playing the part with more softer qualities. But I guess it would be impossible to make everybody happy. :-)|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	Uhm, well, it depends. I thought she was brilliant. The writing was bad though, she sounded like a robot in some parts. "What is going on.?"     That part made me laugh.    I mean, bella was suppose to be fragile yet strong.    I wasn't expecting her to be some small skinny pale girl.|`|NQumSrA3aa	Well, the way I read the book was that first and foremost, Bella is awkward as all hell.  Which I loved, because I can totally relate.  And while Edward sees her as very soft and fragile, I translated that as only how she looked... and that her personality belied all of that.  I never imagined her voice being soft bc her personality is that of a confident and feisty person.      I just wanted to explain that's why I thought Kristen was so perfect for her.  I had seen her other movies and (IMO) she portrays being able look fragile on the outside, but being very tough on the inside very very well.  So I was happy with the decision.    Everyone reads the book differently, though... which is why not everyone was happy with the choice.|`|hdewiFYyaa	yea i think she did good but i just think the issue was that her lines were written funny and they way they told her she was supposed to act. and I thought that the movie would've been alot better too is if she were to have been more clumsy and would've shown more emotion. she just seemed kind of awkward. but she still did good....|`|tC02KPckaa	I agree i pictured bella very fragile to, but the Bella that they casted looked like a tomboy and she didn't do a great job at Bella. She ruined the movie. that is just my opinion.|`|95M9WTqoaa	from how i invisioned bella i thought kristen stewart was extremely close  she has that awkwardness about her that bella has, and i feel like she has the right look  the only thing different is her voice.|`|1UMaVFclaa	AHHHHHHH WHAT ARE YOU THINKING SHE IS LIKE THE BEST PERSON EVER YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOUR SELF FOR EVEN THINKING THAT SHE IS THE BEST PERSON TOP PLAY BELLA OMG SHE IS THE BEST PESON EVER.

y9CgveCGaa	Bargain for all you can get and hold him to it.  Don't ruin the xbox though.  Sell it on ebay if he doesn't live up to the bargain.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	As much as I would love to sledge hammer the hell out my husbands sexbox, if it broke, he would just go buy another one. In face he has two of them. One in the living room (for when the kids are not here) and one in the bedroom (for when they are here) so he can play the more violate games that he likes without pissing me off and without subjecting the kids to violence. So you see.. They love their sexbox so much that they will always find a way to play.    Ask him if he would like a "sexstation" in the bathroom..two shelves..one for the tv and one for the xbox so he can sit on the thrown and play at the same time. If he has to play, he might as well be out of sight and out of mind.|`|hFVPEkWjaa	That sounds crazy, but if that make sense to you then do it.  if you want sex do something really hot that he must stop the game to come to do it wit u .|`|zEp6xHacaa	that box getting more attention than your box is it|`|9BB5H7aJaa	If that carpet is code for out the window;)|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	ooh you're good|`|TRgc8Wvwaa	I wouldn't do it if I were you.

I think I will post a sign on my front door that says "This marriage is a Xbox free zone, all other consoles welcome".|`|khJYKSUraa	sure|`|NxNrZksXaa	hahaha!!  just hide it from him for a few hours.  that ought to get his attention to whatever you're trying to get him to do.|`|OuMhera8aa	ahahaha. go for it.|`|0GkhVzh5aa	... is someone getting less lovin than the xbox... you should sell it on ebay|`|2OILdfw8aa	go for it|`|67a7196b5887b3e34f5402fb17077a45aa	If he's on it all the time,,,go for it.|`|lkJ1M01Uaa	No, xbox's break easy like that.

JXc0O8G9aa	The biggest risk you run is RSI (repetitive stress injury).    Before you play, stretch your arms and fingers a little bit.  John Petrucci describes the stretches he uses before he plays on the Rock Discipline DVD.    When you start out, take it slow at first then build up to speed.  If you start feeling pain, stop and rest.  Eventually you will develop the muscles up enough that you'll be less prone to injury, but even the best guitarists int he world have suffered from RSI so it's a good idea to stretch and warm up every single time you play.|`|jgEvnYNlaa	Believe me when I say to warm up first before doing anything repetitive on the piano. Tendinitis is caused by over doing finger exercises. Even more important is to build up as much hand strength first.|`|OiiKPGwlaa	Yes you could get carpotunnel syndrome. It's good to do strengthening exercises, but stop whenever you feel any pain, and be very careful. Eventually, your fingers will be stronger and able to play better.

Negotiations proposed by white syndicate boss Lucky Luciano never get under way, blood flows and Johnson gets jailed. When Johnson is paroled, he gets the work of enforcer for mighty Stephanie "The Queen" St. Clair. She is also jailed for racketeering and when she leaves she makes him promise "no violence".

BrSDvWacaa	Other than the fact that they play some Classic Rock from that era, I don't think you can attach them to the hippie culture that existed in the 60's.  Morning man John Derringer is pretty right wing.  Back in the day, when I hung in Yorkville, everyone I remember was pretty far left on the spectrum...of course, it's hard to remember a lot of what was going on then!  Q-107 was established in the late 60's or early 70's.  Along with CHUM-FM, it catered to the hippie crowd.  AM-radio was much bigger than FM in those days and was where the money was.  FM stations like Q and CHUM were pretty much left alone by their owners.  They played a lot of album stuff, largely unterrupted by commercials, and often quite obscure.  They were not Top-40 or All-Hits stations like they are now.    Today, FM is where the money is.  Thus, it is highly programmed; commercials rule.  The hippie culture I recall would have nothing to do with it.  Just as they abandoned the commercial world of AM radio in the early 70's, they'd be looking for something more free-form and open-format than the current Q-107.    It will be interesting to see where commercial radio goes from here.  I think things like i-Pods and satellite radio are forcing them to reconsider their niche, which is shrinking fast.  In my view, the only reason left for commercial radio is local information.  We all program our own commercial-free music today.  Unfortunately the marketplace will only support so much local information.  Some of these stations are going to die.  I listened to Derringer for 10 minutes this morning.  He was entertaining, as usual, but I'm sure the last time I bothered with Q-107 was six months ago, and then only for a few minutes also.  Much as I hate to admit it, the only FM I listen to these days is the Communist Broadcasting Collective.  I hate their politics (even though it mirrors my own former naive 60's view of the world) but they're the only commercial-free outlet for local information.    Q-107 is a fine station.  But, it's the antithesis of what it was when it emerged 40 years ago.  It's no more drawn towards the "hippie culture" than any of its competitors.|`|g3hfy9Ziaa	Yes because Toronto is filled with a bunch of useless hippies and anyway Chez 106.1 is a better classic rock station.|`|50eed8c5324c38d13e6a5c7ca2b064e8aa	I have a Q107 in my town.

Why not get a girl who can go allong with the jokes and just laugh with ya and have fun.

Let her go, good grief if she cannot take a joke as silly as this do you really want her in your life?  Move on she has some issues that she needs to deal with and if she breaks up with you over a prank such as this what does the future hold for you two?|`|oaVhxc8caa	this is cute.
