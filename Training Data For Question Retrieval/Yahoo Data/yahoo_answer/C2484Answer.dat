w7USF5wDaa	If your entire idea consisted of "it's sort-of along the lines with vampires or something" then I'd suggest that you didn't have much of a book idea to begin with.  It's no big loss because your idea was completely undeveloped.  If you really want to write about vampires then go for it, because nothing I or anyone else says will make a difference if that is what you're determined to do.   However, if you are planning on trying to get something published you'll probably be waiting quite a while because that market is completely glutted right now.  In another fifteen or twenty years (think about the length of time between the height of popularity of Rice's Vampire Chronicles and Twilight) and there may be a hot market for vampire books again, but not right now.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to think of another topic that you find interesting and that hasn't been done (to death) in a while and try writing about that.  Either that or, since I'm making an educated guess that you are new to writing and it'll be several years before you have something salable, go ahead with the vampire idea and be ahead of the game when the next craze is due.  <br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|LVDoQ1Kaaa	mess around with the topic and see if fits characters and maybe base some of it off Twilight|`|YorMkZYAaa	"It's sort-of along the lines with vampires or something."<br>  <br>  THAT is your problem right there. Get some new ideas that are actually original and have NOTHING to do with vampires. It's overkill now.|`|XxtVwslraa	I say write what's on you're mind to write right now. Vampires will always be around, there's no stopping that. And twilight is going to be a big deal for the next few years, there's no stopping that. Go ahead and write your vampire novel. However, don't expect to publish it any time soon. The market is full of vampires right now and I have a feeling that publishers aren't looking for more. You can try just keep this in mind.

z7lg0l7xaa	Im not trying to be funny or strange, but to answer your question, back in Shakespear's time the only way to keep the audience from throwing rotten fruit at you was to keep them entertained. (Duh) and the way to do that back then was simple. Sex and violence.  Back then that was the only way to entertain.  It was also when acting wasnt a proffession. If you really read Shakespear and analyze it closely, you'll see that that is mostly what Shakespear is getting at.  When he wants to make the all ready drunken audience watch, he cracks a sexual joke or creates a fight.  Simple right? <br>  <br>  I cannot go into depth about what they try to say, but if you truly look at the lines, they (violence and sexual hints) are easy to spot.|`|PvkbBJMVaa	Shakespeare was a great playwright, and I love his work. Romeo and Juliet (although its not my favorite) is a good play anyways, I don't think he would need any publicity for the actual play. People would come to be entertained, and they would be. Plus, Shakespeare's name was famous enough.

This was part of a response to an Aboriginal Stolen Generations inquiry, which found widespread suffering had taken place amongst Australian Aboriginal children forcibly placed into the care of white parents in a little-publicised state government scheme. A large number of Australians walked the bridge in a symbolic gesture of crossing a divide.

The Proclamation of 1763 was an attempt to limit westward expansion and required anyone already living in the Ohio River Valley to give up their land and homes and move back to the eastern sea board communities.<br>  <br>  There were a number of taxes imposed that were robbing the colonists of their money.  At the time, the colonist's economy had grown by over 1000% over the previous 100 years -- to the point that by 1776, America was financially supporting England.<br>  <br>  Lastly, they believed in the right to have a voice in government.  They'd petitioned both Parliament and the King for the right to have a seat in Parliament or an audience with the King -- making them equal to Parliament.  All requests were denied.  Still the taxation increased.  They'd requested to have a local, representative government.  The House of Burgesses represented no one but England.  This request too was denied.  And still the taxes kept mounting.<br>  <br>  Taxation without representation.  Money and land.|`|Z65KWSInaa	Well, taxation without representation was a big deal.  Britain started taxing American colonists more, largely to pay for the French Indian War, or Seven Year War.  (If memory serves me correctly).  The colonies had no one to say yeah, that sounds fair, or no way, we ain't gonna pay.   Boston Tea Party was a result of this.|`|K4lRi1fjaa	G'day JC,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question.<br>  <br>  It depends on what colonists you are referring to.

lUzonjLfaa	they were.....Blonde hair...blue eyes...white skin....usualy had to be strong and athletic. <br>  otherwise known as the <br>  <br>  The Nuremberg Law<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  A conference of ministers was held on August 20, 1935, to discuss the economic effects of Party actions against Jews. Adolf Wagner, the Party representative at the conference, argued that such actions would cease, once the Government decided on a firm policy against the Jews. <br>  <br>  Dr. Schacht, the Economics Minister, criticized arbitrary behavior by Party members as this inhibited his policy of rebuilding Germany's economy. It made no economic sense since Jews had certain entrepreneurial skills that could be usefully employed to further his policies. Schacht made no moral condemnation of Jewish policy and advocated the passing of legislation to clarify the situation. <br>  <br>  The following month two measures were announced at the annual Party Rally in Nuremberg, becoming known as the Nuremberg Laws. Both measures were hastily improvised (there was even a shortage of drafting paper so that menu cards had to be used) and Jewish experts from the Ministry of the Interior were ordered to Nuremberg by plane. <br>  <br>  The first law, The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor, prohibited marriages and extra-marital intercourse between “Jews ” (the name was now officially used in place of “non-Aryans ”) and “Germans ” and also the employment of “German ” females under forty-five in Jewish households. The second law, The Reich Citizenship Law, stripped Jews of their German citizenship and introduced a new distinction between “Reich citizens ” and “nationals.” <br>  <br>  The Nuremberg Laws by their general nature formalized the unofficial and particular measures taken against Jews up to 1935. The Nazi leaders made a point of stressing the consistency of this legislation with the Party program which demanded that Jews should be deprived of their rights as citizens.|`|Omqwye5uaa	Aryans or the nordics|`|fMfBAgOUaa	Aryans.

The repetition of "darkness" isn't necessary: it's imagery we already got, so if you want to make the park darker, find a new way to describe its darkness. <br>  <br>  You also have some conflicting metaphors. The first stanza seems to suggest an image of imprisonment, but I wasn't sure if that was the point of the rest of the poem. Also, there is a conflict between stagnancy and movement. You describe the park as "part of the silence" but at the same time there is a lot of movement and action "tinkling of chains and clinking of metal"  swings blowing back and forth spinning roundabouts. I'm just not sure all the imagery agrees with itself. <br>  <br>  Anyways. good luck wit the rest of it.|`|JRoaOqEIaa	It's okay...

C77c0OE2aa	Yes, you can use such a background and those lights. Exposure is what is going to be the key to a good photo. If you want the background to be white, you are going to have to overexpose the background in relation to your subject, (dog). You will need to have light directed onto the background ideally at higher power than on the dogs. You must then meter your exposure off the DOG. Do not allow the camera to automatically expose for the entire scene. It will read the white background and your dogs will be WAY underexposed. <br>  <br>  Do one of two things after the lights are set up. Move in very close to the dogs until they fill the entire frame of the viewfinder. You do not want the camera to read any of the white background. Take note of the shutter speed and aperture readings. I suggest you use aperture priority and set a fixed aperture of about f4. Then let the camera determine shutter speed with the dogs filling the frame. Then manually set this shutter speed into the camera so the proper exposure will be locked in for the dogs. <br>  <br>  .... or....<br>  <br>  If you camera has a spot meter function, use that to obtain correct exposure on the dogs only.<br>  <br>  So your goal is to be SURE the camera is properly exposing for the dogs ONLY. The extra light on the white background will have it be overexposed and fully white.<br>  <br>  Since you are dealing with dogs, you should try to get a shutter speed of no less than 1/100 of a second if they will remain relatively still. You may have to raise your ISO if your exposure readings are giving you a low shutter speed such as 1/30 or slower. You will have blur in the photo if the dogs move any at all at a slow shutter speed.<br>  <br>  I suggest you use some "dummy" subject under your lighting until you get everything all worked out. The dogs will not likely be real patient while you are trying to sort out your exposures!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.<br>  <br>  steve|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	White or light color sheet<br>  set camera so the pop up flash will fire<br>  set camera on manual  M<br>  WB to sunlight<br>  shutter at 1/180<br>  ISO 100<br>  aperture at f8<br>  stand about 8 feet from them|`|HlQCmCG0aa	Your white sheets or even yellow ones should work fine. If you want to go cheap don't bother with new lights yet, try some different wattage bulbs first in any household lamp, use a sheet or two of white board to reflect some light into the shadow areas behind the dogs. Hopefully you have a tripod, use it.<br>  If you have photo software available, take a few shots without the dogs but have your focus set at where the dogs will be, you can use them as a canvas to 'place' your dogs later in the computer. Try a couple of shots on an object before you do the dogs and see if that is your desired effect. <br>  Iron the linen every well or set up a rather shallow depth of field.<br>  <br>  You asked for cheap, this advice is less than that.<br>  Good luck, taking animal portraits is not easy

GtBOQPKqaa	It sounds like you're (a) seeking to learn why your photos are coming out bad, and (b) you're looking for subject ideas.<br>  <br>  For (a), your photos could be "spot on" technically, so that would leave composition issues. To remedy these, consult any photography book's section about composition, where you'll learn about framing, the rule of thirds, etc. (Only by knowing these rules will you also know when to break them, too.)<br>  <br>  For (b), subject ideas, take your camera wherever you can, and if you find something interesting, photograph it. It could be anything; perhaps a floral arrangement, some birds in a park, your dog playing in the backyard, etc.<br>  <br>  When it comes to the images themselves, be critical of your efforts, as that will only help you improve as a photographer. If something's not right, nor is it acceptable, ask yourself what went wrong in the taking of the photo, so you don't repeat the same mistake later. I've been interested in photography for 30-35 years, since my youth, and by taking that approach, I've become the advanced amateur I am today.<br>  <br>  I'm mostly self-taught, and while I felt I was fairly knowledgeable, I learned much more when I took a darkroom photography course in college.

Only through faith can we begin to grasp the true reality of God consciousness. <br>  <br>  Belief has attained the level of faith when it motivates life and shapes the mode of living. The acceptance of a teaching as true is not faith; that is mere belief. Neither is certainty nor conviction faith. A state of mind attains to faith levels only when it actually dominates the mode of living. Faith is a living attribute of genuine personal religious experience.

9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	Inefficient emperors - As the Ch'ing emperor held absolute power, administration in Peking was efficient only if he was an able man. In the 19th century, however, there was no great Ch'ing emperor.<br>  <br>  ii. Lack of able Manchu leadership - As a race conquering China, the Manchus had always enjoyed powerful political influence greater than their small number should give them. Yet in the late 19th century, capable Manchu leadership was, generally speaking, lacking.<br>  <br>  iii. Downward spread of administrative inefficiency in the government - Without an able emperor to supervise the officials, they became more incompetent, especially when the political structure itself had always the effect of discouraging energetic action in administration. In turn, these incompetent high officials chose incompetent low officials. The harmful effects of inefficiency thus spread downward.<br>  <br>  iv. Sale of government posts - For lack of money to put down rebellions or to meet government expenses, the Ch'ing court increasingly relied on the sale of government posts to enlarge its income. More and mote people acquired government posts in this way. On becoming officials, they squeezed as much money from the common people as they could.<br>  <br>  v. Corruption - Corruption in the government was serious. High officials received "gifts" from low officials. In turn, low officials put government money into their own pockets. Heavy taxes were imposed on the people, who suffered economically.<br>  <br>  vi. Political decentralization - As politics was so corrupt and demoralized, political power could no longer be centralized in Peking. Political decentralization as such had been growing serious since the Taiping Rebellion (1851-1864). At that time, the Ch'ing court permitted the creation of regional armies for suppressing rebellions, since the traditional Eight-Banner forces were weak and useless. These regional armies were locally based, financed by local money, and trained to obey local-provincial officials like Tseng Kuo-fan  and Li Hung-chang. Peking's control over them was ineffective. This factor partly explained why the provinces declared independence in 1911.<br>  <br>  vii. Growth of the scholar-gentry's local power - Because of corruption and inefficiency in the government, the local magistrate was increasingly dependent on the scholar-gentry's cooperation in ruling his county. Consequently, the power of the local scholar-gentry grew. Local men of influence safeguarded local interests. They organized their own military forces for self-defence (known as local militias, t'uan-lien ) and collected taxes themselves.<br>  <br>  For more events see <a href="http://www.thecorner.org/hist/china/chin-revo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecorner.org/hist/china/chin...</a>|`|shVgCizBaa	Xinhai Revolution <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhai_Revolution" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhai_Revo...</a><br>     The Xinhai Revolution or Hsinhai Revolution  also known as the 1911 Revolution or the Chinese Revolution, began with the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911 and ended with the abdication of Emperor Puyi on February 12, 1912. The primary parties to the conflict were the Imperial forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911), and the revolutionary forces of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance (Tongmenghui). The revolution is so named because 1911 is a Xinhai Year in the sexagenary cycle of the Chinese calendar.<br>  <br>  The Xinhai revolution was motivated by anger at government corruption, by frustration with the government's inability to restrain the interventions of foreign powers, and by majority Han Chinese resentment toward a government dominated by an ethnic minority (the Manchus).<br>  <br>  The revolution did not result immediately in a republican form of government; instead, it set up a weak provisional central government over a country which remained politically fragmented. The monarchy was briefly and abortively restored twice, and there was a period of military rule. Though the revolution concluded on February 12, 1912, when the Republic of China formally replaced the Qing Dynasty, internal conflict persisted. The nation endured a failed Second Revolution, the Warlord Era and the Chinese Civil War before the official establishment of the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949. Discussions of the issues surrounding the Xinhai Revolution are often politically charged, as the events that followed played a role in the histories of both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China. The semi-documentary TV series Towards the Republic was banned in the PRC because of its portrayal of the Xinhai Revolution. Nevertheless, the Xinhai Revolution was the first attempt to establish a republic in China that managed to successfully oust the previous government.<br>  <br>  Today, the Xinhai Revolution is commemorated in Taiwan as Double Ten Day (  In mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau the same day is usually celebrated as the Anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. Many overseas Chinese also celebrate the anniversary, termed either "Double Ten Day" or "Anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution", and events are usually held in Chinatowns across the world.<br>  Historical significance<br>  The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Manchu Government and 2000 years of monarchy. Throughout Chinese history, old dynasties had always been replaced by new dynasties. The Xinhai Revolution, however, was the first to overthrow a monarchy completely in an attempt to establish a new political system — a Republic. The Xinhai Revolution established the first democratic republic in Asia — the Republic of China. The laws of the democratic republic were undermined by the Beiyang warlords, and a monarchy was briefly restored. However, the republic enjoyed such broad public support that it could not be overturned.<br>  <br>  The Chinese revolutionaries had not evolved their own form of republican government. As a result, they followed the American Constitution and the American political system, and they implemented a presidential republic. This continued despite social limitations and despite the provisional constitution's shortcomings. At one time, Sun Yat-sen modified the constitution to limit Yuan Shikai's power, while Yuan Shikai later annulled the constitution to proclaim himself emperor. During the early years of the Republic of China, democracy was not fully fledged. However, it was the first time China had attempted to form a republic, which nevertheless spread democratic ideas throughout China.<br>  <br>  Long after the success of the Xinhai Revolution, some support for monarchy persisted in China, and for a while, the monarchy maintained its social influence. Even though the Communist Party of China claimed to have created the "people's democratic dictatorship" in 1949 with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, true democracy (e.g. the separation of power in the United States) was never fully implemented by the Beiyang Government, the Nanjing Government led by the Nationalist Party, or the Government of the People's Republic of China.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  After each province had had its own democratic revolution, China entered a long period of turmoil and division. Excepting the period after the Second Revolution during which Yuan Shikai briefly reunified the nation, subsequent Chinese regimes were unable to unify China. For example, the Nationalist Government claimed itself the head of a unified China while it was only able to receive taxation from five provinces.[citation needed] It was not until 1950 that the Communist Party of China was able to re-unify China. The prolonged divisions and wars retarded China's economic development and the modernisation of its infrastructure.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Social influence<br>  The influence of Xinhai Revolution on Chinese society was not as wide as commonly

lhbEY5eJaa	well you could start with the main thing you want the story to revolve around i.e. people runnig from something dangerous or people running from death, then you could think about how long you would like to make it,you must be committed or the story will get no where.<br>  usually if you have a good conflict climax and resolution the story will wrap up around those things. another technique i like to use is working from back to front i.e. i know the end he will die,then i think of how i want him to die,then i can think of what led to that,then i can think of why it led to that and then i can think of how his life was before it all happened. thats the way i like  to work.<br>  well good luck

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	When Sartre is referring to the phenomenon of things happening 'for-others', he seems to be thinking of what Jung would call a 'mask' - it's a kind of inauthenticity that is created by interpersonal interactions.  Some much more than others.<br>  <br>  In a sense, it's an extension of Hegel's dialectic.  When two people meet, often the first thing they want to do is establish some kind of dominance.  Are you a threat?  Are you useful to me?  And so on.  It's a kind of survival trait.  Sartre makes a point of extending it to your own authenticity as well:  if you meet someone who insists that you are something, that insistance is going to define your future relationship.<br>  <br>  So perhaps another way to talk about Sartre's 'for-others' is to think of it as 'not-yourself'.  And here's where we come into an interesting wrinkle.<br>  <br>  Sartre didn't think it was completely impossible for people to be authentic around other people... just almost so.  It is the imagined and unnecessary roles and expectations that fence us in.  This is one reason why he thought Marxism was superior to capitalism - people were supposed to be more equal and more free.<br>  <br>  So when we're talking about a relationship, we are probably talking about something that might go either way.  We've probably all had the experience of a friend who behaves in a completely different manner around his new mate.  The question before us is whether the new behaviour is just filling the mate's expectations, leaving him as much a prisoner as before, or whether the behaviour is what he always wanted to do but only now feels like he has license to be authentic about?  So such behaviour MIGHT be 'for-others', but it might be authentic, too.<br>  <br>  Certainly the role you take on at work, when you're riding the bus, or so on is 'for-others'.  There are hundreds of social rules and most people are following them all the time.  In a room-ful of strangers the 'for-others' can dominate so you suppress yourself strongly to avoid tramping on their social toes.  Sartre would argue that this doesn't stop when you leave the room; that it follows you into every aspect of your life at one level or another.  So it goes.

SUBLIMINAL|`|AA11564934	Maybe irony?|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Though it's close, we're probably not talking about irony here.  Irony is a knowing deception - a pretended ignorance - use when a speaker INTENDS to convey the opposite of what he says.  Reverse psychology has the same problem with intentionality.  You seem to be referring to that part of a normal discussion that implies its opposite; something that is always present and not intentionally deceptive.<br>  <br>  The term I usually used for this kind of a notion is 'negative space' (link 1).  It's actually drawn from visual imagery:  the negative space is the space around and outside of a focal object.  It's not something that is overtly there, but always implicitly, and some exceptional artists even capitalize on it in an ironic way.<br>  <br>  It seems apt to me to talk, then, about the 'negative space' in a conversation, for example - those things that were not said but were present because of what was said.  Or in a number of other senses.<br>  <br>  I don't know of any univesally used term to describe what you're talking about.  But at least many people familiar with art will understand what you mean if you borrow that one.
gCjZmlqMaa	Then don't read it...poems are lame..i cant stand them|`|e3AvZLZWaa	It's a love poem. In most of the lines, she's comparing his love to other things (similes). She's saying that his love is sweet, welcoming, and pure. In the end, she's saying that she has what she always wanted: to be with this man that she loves day after day. She calls him her "lord" because she's saying that it's like, for example, a king (him) and a loyal servant (her). She'd do anything for him and she'd serve him loyally forever; she'd give him what he wants without questioning or a second thought. Basically, she's saying that she really loves this man and she's devoted to him.|`|MuCNK2vxaa	Ha. Neither do I. They don't capitalize "lord" so we can't assume that I means "lord" as in God, but they might just have forgotten to. Also, they capitalized "Gods" although it shouldn't be capitalized because the only capitalized "god" is single as in God not gods because that would be gods. I know, I'm rambling so I'll stop wasting your time with my useless pondering. Good luck and God bless!|`|0KDwifgGaa	I think this is simply a woman deeply happy and content to be with the man she loves, and grateful to be able to share her days with him. She compares the feelings engendered by his presence and nearness to a series of gentle, calming, soothing and pleasurable experiences and images,|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	This is a very intimate song of love.<br>  <br>  Love poem of intimacy probably resulting from a long term marriage.  She sees his love as massaging, replenishing, and refreshing.  It is clean as in prepared, pressed, washed and she knows his smell and considers it as a fragrance that is comforting as he returns from the streets (probably from work or taking care of business).  It (his love) is sweet whether eaten (berries) or drunken(beer) and fulfilling, familiar as a meal (wine and bread).<br>  <br>  As time passes, they love each other as they grow old, as she is not in a hurry because  it is as she wishes it to be.|`|xIlIbZJtaa	It is a poorly written/ translated love poem, probably from a middle aged womans perspective. It means more in the language it was first written in and doesn't translate well into english, by the look of it. Unless I'm missing something, I don't see much depth there. Its just about someones affections for a man she looks up to (Lord) and not meaning Christ or anything.

The real positive aspect about what you've started is that this subject can continue in this same vein or you can branch out and add to what you've started.  Maybe write some follow up to the ideas that you already have.  You can explore the idea that none of us are what we appear to be, but still we can dream. There is always that aspect of taking away the things we love. The notion also of more time.  And of course the idea that no matter what comes or what changes, life goes on in reality or memory.  You can use some of those ideas to change the present work or use the ideas to create something different and new.  The imagination is a good thing.|`|Vvd2BMn1aa	That's awesome!

They didn't have the diagnostic procedures they have today.  Now if there had been a head trauma and the person acted strange or didn't function very well afterward, they could put two and two together and determine that it was due to the head trauma.<br>  <br>  They knew nothing about babies being brain damaged if they lost oxygen during delivery. They didn't know how a mother's diet could effect a baby.  They didn't know how emotional traumas could effect people. Sometimes they could put two and two together and figure it out.  They didn't have cat scans. They didn't have MRIs.  They didn't have xrays.  <br>  <br>  Years ago I was looking at census records in Travis County, Texas.

They kept on asking him, "What's your name?"  "Where are you from?"  Finally he told one his name was, "Lee."  They all jumped on top of him and kept asking him questions over and over and a guard had to come around and beat them off with great big keys.

gGZz2EGyaa	Common Sense was a pamphlet written by Thomas Paine. It was first published anonymously on January 10, 1776, during the American Revolution. Common Sense presented the American colonists with an argument for independence from British rule at a time when the question of independence was still undecided. Paine wrote and reasoned in a style that common people understood; forgoing the philosophy and Latin references used by Enlightenment era writers, Paine structured Common Sense like a sermon and relied on Biblical references to make his case to the people.  Historian Gordon S. Wood described Common Sense as, “the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era.”<br>  <br>  I have given you two web sites that you can get more information from for your essay.

wbyz32sFaa	Well, the British didn't necessarily gain much, but Britain itself was one of the chief founders of the League of Nations, and along with France gained control of German overseas territories as International territories or mandates, as well as getting some compensation, along with France and the USA, crippling Germany, and they only paid off these debts in the 1980s.<br>  <br>  Some in the British Public didn't agree because they didn't think the penalties imposed on Germany were harsh enough, such as the shrinking of its armed forces, while others thought that the penalties were too high and would cause the collapse of post-war Germany, leading to blame being rested on the winning side of the war. This in turn would lead to resentment and then someone would take power as a dictator, and start war all over again. (No prizesfor guessing who did that).|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Britain gained former German and Ottoman Empire colonies under the Mandate system , really just a euphemism for imperial expansion.<br>    From Germany - German SouthWest Africa (now Namibia) and Tanganyike (now Tanzania)<br>  From Ottoman Turkey - Palestine (now Israel)  Aden (now Yemen) and Jordan.<br>  Germany also had to hand over their entire surface navy to Britain (however, the German sailors scuttled the fleet at Scapa Flow when they arrived to hand over the ships)<br>  <br>   Public opinion in Britain thought Germany had been let off lightly;for example,the Germans had to pay $6 billion (worth much more in today's money) to France as reparations. "Squeeze them till the pips squeak" had been a popular newspaper headline during the Paris Peace Conference.It should be remembered Britain sufered more than 800,000 war dead, and it was said 'every family lost someone' in Britain during WW1.

fMfBAgOUaa	Depending on what you're recording, you will probably want a decent microphone. SM-57's are good for guitars, condenser mics are good for vocals. You will probably want something that can be used for more than one thing, so an SM-57 or similar might be good for you. Audacity is fine to work with, I use it all the time myself (and I also record guitar with a simple desktop mic... of course its not amazing quality but it gets the job done). Im also broke so I just use what I've got lol.

Have you tried doing a contact print?  Do a contact print first, just to be sure your negative is sharp.<br>  <br>  Also, trying rasing the head.  It sounds like the lamphouse and negative carrier are way too close to the paper.  I'm not familiar with your particular enlarger, but the head should just be mounted on the column with a track, and then you can loosen the knob and raise or lower the head.  That's for changing the size of the enlargement and for rough adjustments.  The focus knob on the head to adjust the bellows is just for fine adjustments.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  By the way, if you ARE going to do a contract print, then set a sheet of clean glass on your negative and the photo paper.  Do NOT leave your negative in a plastic archival sheet when you do the print, because it will diffuse the light and the image will look horribly soft and out of focus.  Some of those archive storage sleeves are "supposed" to be transparent and clear enough to make contact prints without taking out the negative, but it never works.  Take out your negative and put a sheet of glass on top instead (or use a contact prnter).  And of course, I don't have to tell you this, but be sure you're wearing gloves when you hold your negatives.

I used the scripture from Genesis (located just after the table of contents) because I loved the phrase "the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil." Isn't this exactly what Bella ends up with? A working knowledge of what good is, and what evil is. The nice thing about the apple is it has so many symbolic roots. You've got the apple in Snow White, one bite and you're frozen forever in a state of not-quite-death... Then you have Paris and the golden apple in Greek mythology—look how much trouble that started. Apples are quite the versatile fruit. In the end, I love the beautiful simplicity of the picture. To me it says: choice.<br>  .<br>  (If you go into more detail you find it is a Fire and Ice rose)<br>   That is a ruffled tulip. As for the meaning... If you've read the Twilight FAQ, you know that the apple cover had a lot of meaning for me, and I was an active part of the covering process. However, that experience is more the exception than the rule in the publishing world. Something to keep in mind if you intend to embark on a career as a writer: lots of things you might expect to be under your control are not. Covers, for example. Those are mostly up to the publisher and the marketing and sales departments. So I don't know what the tulip means—I didn't have anything to do with this one.

To build great hopes of those things that seem out of my reach, I have to go deep into my soul(the earth).<br>  water water every where but not a drop to drink.Probably my favorite line is the last line.

There are a few skyscrapers, and wide buildings. All of them have lights on, but some of the lights look like they're different colors, which is really interesting. But one thing that really caught my eye was the sky in the background. It looks fake and all, but you can tell that the artist meant for it to be either sunrise or sunset, which helps you understand the picture a bit more because you now have an idea of what the setting is like. Also, the altostratus clouds make the sky look wondrous. Judging by the gray nimbostratus-looking clouds above the altostratus clouds, it may rain soon. Meaning that the weather is not fair or calm; it must be windy. You can see hills in the distance with a kind of haze over it like a veil that says that they're kind of far away. Either that, or it's raining over there. You can also see the ocean. Also, there's a cruise ship which suggests the economy of this place. Also, even though it looks like the beginning of nighttime, many people are still awake (the lights support this). This place must be very lively and technical. It kind of reminds me of New York City, in a way.|`|HlQCmCG0aa	Horizon is off just a bit, rather squarish in the crop for a landscape, over color saturated. <br>  <br>   Awfully pretty as a picture.<br>  Over cooked and well-done.<br>  Just like the ones my mother used to make.<br>  Every cloud has a silver lining,  yours are red.<br>  Anything and everything happens in Rio.|`|WaJdOaFKaa	I don't care for the crop.

WaJdOaFKaa	A quality scan of film negatives taken from a disposable camera will have sufficient resolution to retain a fair amount of latitude for editing in a program like photoshop, if you know what you are doing with it.  In fact, the average 35mm film negative holds more resolution than most of the more popular digital cameras, and a 35mm slide would only be equaled in resolution by the most advanced DSLR's currently on the market - notice I wrote "equaled", not surpassed.  Don't think that simply because film has largely been made obsolete by more convenient digital technology, that it is of a lesser quality.  It is not - your friend doesn't know what he or she is talking about.  It would only look pretty bad if the negs were scanned cheaply by the lower resolution scanners used by 1 hour photomats, and if you aren't proficient at using photoshop - if that were the case, digital images edited by a novice photoshop user would look pretty bad as well.  It's all relative.|`|R3UVYaHtaa	well,, you can edit some cool effects before developing your film... like you can use a colored plastic papers to edit some color effect or some kind of black papers with holes with multiple expose..... this site can help a lot...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.camerafilters.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.camerafilters.com/</a><br>  <br>  good luck

c8CFPgRlaa	That's a tough question to answer. Seeing as how you play piano, I will immediately assume that you are into some classical music. Therefore, an acoustic guitar would be great for you. Hit up either Guitar Center or Marty's Music for a place where you can pick-up-and-play any guitar you want.<br>  <br>  Acoustics are great because they have a very "raw" sound. With electric guitars, you can make errors and "cover" them up with the distortion. With acoustics, it's all you. Plus, acoustics are cheaper.|`|5GslKD4baa	Start out with a classical (spanish) guitar - you don't use a pick for that and it has a softer tone.<br>  I can HIGHLY recommend a guitar of the brand "Santana".<br>  <br>  You can probably get a DVD-tutor where ever you're gonna buy the guitar.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of stuff on youtube.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of stuff on google, it's quite easy to find; just type "guitar lesson free online" into the search bar and press enter.<br>  There should be more than enough (:<br>  <br>  Here's an example:<br>  <a href="http://justinguitar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://justinguitar.com/</a><br>  <br>  Really helpful site.<br>  <br>  You should start out by learning some chords, while practicing these chords, you should learn to play and sing easier songs, that match the level you're at, and the chords you're practicing.<br>  <br>  By the way, here's a list of the chords (I don't know if it's all of them):<br>  <a href="http://www.xguitar.com/help/chords.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xguitar.com/help/chords.html</a><br>  The number to the left is the deep E, and the one furthest right is the high e.<br>  The numbers correspond to the fret your fingers are supposed to be placed. 0 means an open string (no fingers touching it) and x means that the string should not be played (or muted at least).<br>  <br>  Well, learn the tabulator system (tab for short).<br>  <a href="http://www.zentao.com/guitar/tab/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zentao.com/guitar/tab/</a>|`|AA10392394	i think the acoustic guitar would be a better starter because you can take it anywhere and it's not a hassle like an electric.  then get a book and learn one chord per day.  then learn the penatonic scale to play lead.  it's easy...good luck.|`|JCWcsuaraa	you can learn alot from freeandeasyguitar.com. :)|`|r8CmwwNiaa	hahahaha thats funny, that's exactly where i'm at.......I've played guitar a little though. Get a Squire and a small amp(starter pack) it should be around $300. Then just learn where your notes are on guitar then you can apply your music theory once you know your scales on guitar just start shredding away on those pentatonic scales.|`|i7dKy6rGaa	My Advice would be go for something lower priced as your playing Improves so should you guitar and amp if your going for electric.My Brand Choice would be  Epipone,Dean, or Ibanez for your first guitar.
mY4m47WTaa	Emily refused to pay the new taxes by referring to the agreement between her father (?) and the dead judge (or mayor, I can't remember) of the town. That agreement was made because her family saved the town financially somehow a generation or two previously. She simply ignored the tax collection bills that they sent to her. She thus exhibited stubborn pride about her family's status in the town, even though no one really remembered or cared anymore.|`|SaNoaVVqaa	That's a little confusing...more detail?|`|tLmjn5x9aa	woah, woah, woah back up a little?|`|xJoMSkI5aa	She clings to the old ways even as she tries to break free.

Although there may not be ends and feelings may be flowing into one another, because you chose to write, you must follow grammar rules.  The content is fair to good.  There is nothing exceptional here and it makes the reader feel sorry for you with the line "But do the ones who hurt me, say sorry?  The reason this is a trail mix is because you are looking for justification and apology.  You have learned that it should be done when you wrong someone but you are finding that when you expect it, you don't get it from others.  Could it be that they don't realize that you have been wronged?|`|mcomAA2eaa	Sorry, for a 15 years old, it's not very good.

It had good parts,  but it kind of repeats the danger part. Some repetition is good such as when you repeat "Mixed feelings/ are dreadful" because they add emphasis, but I found that the repetition of danger didn't do this. And, nothing against you, I personally tend to lean towards poems that rhyme although I have found amazing non-rhyming poems. Keep writing though. Even if every person says they hate it, keep writing. If it's what you enjoy doing for whatever reason (want to go pro, a creative outlet, a hobby, etc.) then keep doing it. You should be your own biggest fan. Okay, I'm going to shut up now because I'm rambling.

I write poetry as well but I can't give you any thoughts on the level an English major might.

I've heard from others that Beyond Good and Evil and The Gay Science are good places to start for the beginner (this is how I've started, and I would agree). Kaufmann, Nietzsche's renown translator, advised readers to not begin with The Birth of Tragedy without foreknowledge of his later works because Nietzsche evolved greatly and became more sophisticated--and thus you'd miss out on seeing the changes if you began at the beginning :P<br>  <br>  I want to read all of Nietzsche's works to get a solid perspective of his philosophy.

aCDWwsisaa	There are really only two different "kinds" of electric guitar; Gibson-style guitars (with heavy bodies, hum-bucking pick-ups, and usually broader necks) which sound better for "Bluesy" guitar, and Fender-style guitars (with lighter bodies, straight pick-ups. and narrower necks) which sound better for "rock"...(the Squier would fit this mold)...<br>  <br>  But in truth, it is the guitarist that matters not the guitar, so buy your first at a yard sale for $25, save your money, and practice for a few hours every day...<br>  <br>  Girl guitarists rock...you gotta love Liz Phair, Ani DiFranco, Kelley Deal, Kristin Hersh, Tanya Donnelly...|`|oweQc1OBaa	the one your looking at is great for beginners. <a href="http://www.guitarcenter.com/Fender-Stop-Dreaming-Start-Playing-SE-Special-Strat-Pack-With-Squier-SP-10-Amp-104486238-i1177837.gc" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarcenter.com/Fender-Stop-...</a> i think that's the one your looking at. my review on it:: it was my first guitar, loved it . but after a few months it does start to get a bit old. and you might start wanting a cooler guitar. the strings on it are not the best, but that is the same with all guitars, so just buy an extra pack of electric strings. you may have trouble with the guitar cable too, so you might want to get one the has the metal things around it. overall, great guitar for price, comes with everything you need.<br>  <br>  you might want a different guitar value pack if you don't like that style. there are plenty more <a href="http://www.guitarcenter.com/Electric-Value-Pack-Electric-Guitar.gc?o=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarcenter.com/Electric-Val...</a> if you want a guitar that would last longer, you would need to pay a bit more. <br>  <br>  all of those guitars looks and sounds nice, and will last long if you take good care of it.<br>  <br>  good luck and hope this helps!|`|Vvd2BMn1aa	The only electric guitars I know that are cheap, and have an awesome sound, are guitars made by Washburn.

DvToP5h7aa	Othello, Moor of Venice <br>  <br>  ?  Othello declares himself the "one who loved not wisely, but too well," and then sums up the bulk of the play. In his final note, Othello pulls out a hidden weapon and stabs himself, declaring himself a circumcised dog. He has done an evil thing, but by killing himself, had conquered the villain (himself) and therefore become the hero of his own story. Othello kisses Desdemona’s dead lips and then dies himself, a murderer, martyr, and lover to the end. <br>  <br>  ?  Lodovico tells Iago to look at his work: three innocent people lying next to each other, all destroyed by his scheming. Still, Iago keeps his promise and stays silent. Gratiano is to inherit all of Othello’s worldly goods, and Montano is charged with punishing the wicked Iago. Sadly, Lodovico decides that all he can do is go back to Venice to share this tragic tale.<br>  <br>  Full Scene Summary:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/event/literature/william-shakespeare/othello/act-v-scene-ii.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/event/literature/w...</a><br>  <br>  ======================================<br>  <br>  The Willow Song<br>  <br>  As Desdemona is preparing for bed the night she will be murdered, she starts singing a song about willow trees. This song, supposedly sung originally by one of Desdemona’s mother’s servants who loved a crazy guy, reflects Desdemona’s own situation. She herself is worried that the man she married has gone crazy and will desert her. Willows at the edge of water are a traditional symbol of women deserted by their lovers. (In another Shakespearean example, Ophelia, deserted by her love, Hamlet, dies after she falls out of a willow tree and drowns in a brook in the play Hamlet).<br>  <br>  <br>  Candle<br>  <br>  The candle that Othello blows out just before he strangles Desdemona symbolizes Desdemona’s fragile life. Othello draws the comparison himself. "If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, / I can again thy former light restore, / should I repent me," he says to the candle. "But," he says to the sleeping Desdemona, "once put out thy light, / Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature, / I know not where is that Promethean heat / That can thy light relume" (5.2.8-13). So he can put out and relight the candle over and over, yet kill Desdemona only once.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/literary-device/literature/william-shakespeare/othello/symbols-imagery-allegory.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/literary-device/li...</a>|`|ceBTTCPwaa	Othello, the Moor of Venice is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in approximately 1603, and based on the Italian short story "Un Capitano Moro" (A Moorish Captain) by Cinthio (a disciple of Boccaccio) first published in 1565. The work revolves around four central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army; his wife Desdemona; his lieutenant, Cassio; and his trusted ensign Iago. Because of its varied themes — racism, love, jealousy and betrayal — Othello remains relevant to the present day and is often performed in professional and community theatres alike. The play has also been the basis for numerous operatic, film and literary adaptations.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Othello" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Othello</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/oth/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/oth/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ot..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ot...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/othello/index...." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/othello/index....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/F..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/F...</a>

ceBTTCPwaa	Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (often shortened to Huck Finn) is a novel written by Mark Twain and published in 1884. It is commonly regarded one of the Great American Novels, and is one of the first major American novels written in the vernacular, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry "Huck" Finn, best friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels.<br>  The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. By satirizing a Southern antebellum society that was already anachronistic at the time of its publication, the book is an often scathing look at entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. The drifting journey of Huck and his friend Jim, a runaway slave, down the Mississippi River on their raft may be one of the most enduring images of escape and freedom in all of American literature.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/huckleberryfin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/huckleberryfin...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/H..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/H...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://summarycentral.tripod.com/theadve..." rel="nofollow">http://summarycentral.tripod.com/theadve...</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	From Shmoop, here is a list of quotes by theme.

jiMAtaCraa	Not really, as it assumes that everything on this planet has a definite answer. Unless it is Maths, rarely do things have an "exact" answer. Yes, even Science has to go through a constant process of trial-and-error before it can actually define what it has found out to be an absolute truth. A lot of what we regard as "answers" are actually opinions that have a social backing to make appear as if they are correct.<br>  <br>  It would be pretty cool though. It is said that every Human being knows the rest of the world through a chain of 6 other individuals.

This is why good research produces new questions that will expand knowledge but not always answers.  In medicine many people see it as advanced but in actual fact doctors know very little and in the future will be seen, as we see witch doctors today.  Some times people do have the answers but no one listens to them, this however still does not mean some one some where has the answer.  Some things will exist that people have not even asked questions about as human knowledge is still very small and only as knowledge advances do questions appear.<br>  <br>  We are still not that far ahead of the Chimpanzees, in fact from the problems we cause we may not have caught up to them.|`|l82F5puuaa	Of course not!|`|FmbwIbtzaa	We can only know what we have experienced.

Babbage effecticely invented teh computer before the technology existed to build it.<br>  <br>  Electricity. In the UK the national grid approach is interesting - one of the reasons why PV panels that export back work so well.<br>  <br>  The PCB was a milestone. Interesting that effecticely computers are used to design themselves.<br>  <br>  Banking system is like the oil that lubricates industry and investment.<br>  2.from the technological-skepticism dept<br>  <br>  Our recent stance in the debate about extensive safety testing was predicated on the fact that by and large technology improves our lives, and thus innovation shouldn't be held back out of concern that we might make a mistake. Of course, this reasoning fails against anyone who doesn't accept that technology does in fact lead to lifestyle improvements. The Guardian has an interesting interview with one such individual, William Davies of London's Institute For Public Policy Research. Davies' concerns over new technological trends stem from the fact that unlike past periods of innovation, which helped the supply side deliver goods more efficiently, the rise of mobile phones and computing affect the end user, threatening to dangerously reshape society. One of his central points is something of an old one, that individuals equipped with technology will miss out on important face-to-face experiences. As he puts his conclusion, "...what I do believe to be necessary is that we recognise that part and parcel of modernisation is to put checks on that modernisation. And that we should give weight to the forms of conservatism that say: This is all the technology we want."<br>  <br>  His stance can obviously be tackled from many angles, including the fact that technology allows us to make important human connections that had been heretofore impossible. More important, however, is countering the idea that it's society's job to make choices as to what technologies we will accept and which ones we won't. What Davies (and many others) fail to acknowledge is that broad technological changes are the result of millions of individuals making choices. Everyone who owns a cell phone had to weigh the pros and cons of buying one, and each person decided that they would be better off with one. The idea that an enlightened board can decide what is best for everyone ignores the fact that we're all individuals. Davies' technological skepticism echoes the thinking behind Barry Schwartz' popular book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less. In it he argues that our abundance, at places like the supermarket, often leaves people confused and frustrated, as opposed to happier and better off. What makes both of their arguments so seductive is the fact that everyone can relate to the problems they identify; sometimes it is overwhelming when we're faced with too many choices. It can be lonely to look around and see everyone silently listening to their iPods. But their arguments fail because it is not enough to just identify flaws to say that a system is broken. The fact that there are problems means we need to innovate some more in order to solve them, not put the brakes on technology out of fear that we'll create new ones. A society in which people aren't allowed to work on new solutions to problems and apply their talents would have many more problems than a lack of communication between passengers on their subway ride.

Rowling and her Harry Potter books to back off.(No offense) I've seen the Harry Potter movies.  They were good.  Though, in my opinion, Twilight vs Harry Potter......came to a TIE.  That's right people, a TIE.  I agree with you guys, some say Twilight is better, Harry Potter is better...but I say that it is a tie.  Twilight has the thrill of death, blood, vampires.... while Harry Potter came to magic,wizardry, spells, and wizards.  They fall in the same category.  Fantasy.  They should be to a tie....|`|65cx6dIdaa	Ok I haven't read Harrry Potter. I think J. K Rowling is a good writer though.

A1wqNFHwaa	Yeah these poems are all pretty good. I especially like the second one. Keep writing!|`|e3AvZLZWaa	For #1, I think you mean "soul" not "sole". Believe me, I write a lot of poems about souls (my soul/spirit), so I should know. <br>  Also, it seems as if these are all about a girl in a past relationship(s). And are you talking about suicide for the first two?<br>  And yeah, I think you're pretty good, but who am I to judge seeing as I'm only 13. But I've written a lot of poems (and I've only started this year, but I've caught the drift of it. It comes naturally :D). You may want to try writing about a different theme because reading about this girl all the time makes me wonder.... But if you do write about other things, then you should consider showing poems with a variety of themes instead of just one.<br>  <br>  Ooh, I really like the one that you just added as soon as I posted my answer :D. That's my type of poem.
agwxFmITaa	Very well done!  Nearly as good as the X-ray of your head!  Maybe there is a hole THROUGH the fitted carpet.  A kinda tube? Which you all use to get to your basement?  And cover it with a baby bath when not in use?|`|MojYmo5Jaa	There is something under his left arm pit which could be the original baby and you transferred the photo of your son and daughter on it. You cut round the negative of your son and daughter and placed it over the baby bath, then developed it? That's why you can still see the baby head under this armpit.|`|lILfQh6xaa	it is a stage and all the stuff in the backround is a picture itself. where he is would be an already built in hole so he could sit in there.|`|WaJdOaFKaa	Uh, false floor perhaps?|`|HlQCmCG0aa	Very carefully.<br>  Before your wife cut your son in half, you drugged your daughter so she won't faint or (since this is a pre-911 response) call the operator asking for the police.<br>  You placed plastic sheeting over everything, cut the poor lad in half, placed his half carcass in the tub, removed the plastic sheeting, gave your daughter another hit on the opium bong, Said 'Hey, he was only your half-brother anyway, rub a little baby powder on him'. Click!  And you did it all at just ten minutes to twelve on Dec. 23rd,( no sense wasting presents on wasted children!)|`|MlxxqLMYaa	I've never done it before, but layered transparencies?<br>  A hole cut in the basin to allow your son to fit in, taken against a white backdrop.. then take another photo of the living room with the basin sitting on the floor and layer the two....<br>  <br>  I'm guessing... I've used film for 35 years but never manipulated. I've never had the tools to do the job.<br>  <br>  Very nicely composed image though... and very funny!|`|ahH0AD80aa	Wow! I think, your house is in the middle of a beach... maybe, and that isn't carpet... it's sand! You just dug a hole in the sand and your son put his legs through the bottom of the baby bath into the sand hole.<br>  <br>  What ever you done, I love the picture! :D|`|Au0HK3O6aa	The baby bath has only one side and your son was lying flat out on the floor with half his body in the bath - good trick but you can see a piece of his flesh on the left side as you are looking at it.|`|sDZNFp3laa	Photo of you son/daughter trimmed out, then placed over photo of living room & bath & re-photogpraphed? (no reflection of the kids in the TV screen)|`|Qnop8tkjaa	I have no idea. That is REALLY good manipulation though. I can't even do that as well using Photoshop.|`|Ue9xrUkbaa	Oh! Idk but this is cute! I love this!|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	Your son has no legs?|`|5nbFcdElaa	Well, <br>  Hmm...I think that the floor might have a hole in it or you took a picture of a dead person.|`|NImJALxgaa	Its obvious, Hes being sucked through a wormhole into another Galaxy.|`|CPObbqfsaa	i would say hole in the ground.. hallow tub and hole through towel.<br>  <br>  GOOD stuff.. that or your son doesnt have lower body|`|fMfBAgOUaa	Well, the back (left side) of the tub doesnt look contiguous... it comes out from under his arm and just kind of stops, rather than curving around.... Thats the only thing I noticed that might have something to do with it. Other than that I have no clue.<br>  <br>  I sure hope you're going to tell us how :)<br>  <br>  edit: also, why does your son have a hair tie on his wrist, when he doesnt have long hair?|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Hole in the floor, towel and tub that doesn't actually have water in it?
3hNlKkMMaa	You have a good start for being 13. You're going to have to work more on getting your faces more symmetrical, but that will come with time. The best advice any one can give you is to just keep practicing. The more you draw, the better you will get. Drawing from life is also very useful. Draw what is actually in front of you. It always looks better when I draw someone in front of me instead of drawing them from a photo.<br>  <br>  Also, if you want to join an online art community like deviantArt, you can get feedback from other artists. My deviantart account is thequietwriter.deviantart.com. If you decide to join, add me as a friend and let me know you are the person I met on Yahoo Answers... I'll add you back and help you in the future. Not that I'm the best artist in the world myself.

I'm a bit of an artist myself but not as great and awesome as you i just draw mine flat and not so much dimension. Anyways, keep trying you most best!|`|8MQZz17Baa	completely honest, i tihnk the first and the third are amazing. and, not so much the second haha<br>  keep working on it=] your only thirteen. and they are really good.|`|H3gwlijraa	The first and third one are great, but I think the third one is the best.

N8zJERG5aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Dean emulated & idolised Marlon Brando's acting style but also tried to lead his life like him too so much that it upset Brando.  Dean had also been separated from his father from a young age like Brando and were never close.  In Dean's roles he frequently played young angry rebels which helped with his method acting as he was expressing his inner emotions & turmoil - it was a release for him.  Brando style's from the school of Konstantin Stanislavski. His motto was "Think of your own experiences and use them truthfully."  Stella Adler was his mentor. Brando's parents were both alcoholics & with his father away a lot his mum would be intoxicated most of the time so he'd act to try & draw her out of it & attract her attention.

You have a choice, we all have a choice, to live with it as is OR modify it to our liking more. <br>  <br>  In the genuinely conscious-awareness sense, to become responsible is to learn from our mistakes specifically by not repeating them if the outcome was un-favorable. Even a 'fully-responsible' individual who follows the rules of society, obeys laws, acts accordingly as a faithful partner, contributes positively to their work environment and achieves a 'place' in their community-- this individual can still feel 'lost'. <br>  <br>  Responsible does not equate to knowing thyself completely . . .<br>  <br>  sharing the light,<br>  Miss Erica Hidvegi|`|oGVvEl3Maa	very true.  thank you for your posts.<br>  <br>  peace and blessings be upon you...<br>  Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	One must be responsible; as responsible as possible. But even if a past choice must be lived with, often our painful memories can be seen with fresh eyes, and we can reinterpret them in ways that help us move on. I'm not suggesting deceiving oneself into believing things happened that didn't, or omitting painful events. But sometimes people blame themselves for things that could not have been avoided, and part of growing up is realizing this.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Interesting way of putting it. I like the words conscious and awareness, because it implies a continuous movement. I think of it like this screen shot that creates a story FROM it. At any time your human body can be thinking or not thinking or any of an infinite number of others things. The awareness I think of when I hear the word "awareness" is always considering everything that isn't happening, in attempt to control or predict something. I suspect "thought" is another of our senses. I think we are robots or not robots depending and completely inconsistently.

tTaDBaM4aa	Be honest with everyone involved.  When you are a musician with a work ethic and you are grouped with a bunch of people who are not interested in practicing you will always be unhappy with them.  Eventually you will say something to them in frustration and probably lose some friends.  There is nothing wrong with people having different levels of commitment.  Tell them that you enjoy them but want to be a part of something that requires a higher level of commitment.  As far as the band you would like to hook up with,  just ask them if you could sit in with them at a practice sometime.  Tell them you would like them to hear you play, no strings attached, and no hard feelings.  If for any reason they don't like you or your playing no big deal. If they let you sit in remember this, most bands are looking for people that are easy to work with and that complement what they are already doing.  This means show them that you can fill the rhythm or lead parts they are missing.  Don't try and show off or show anyone up that will be an instant death sentence.  Don't be afraid to ask them for the try out.  If you sit back and don't, someone else will, I guarantee it.|`|fMfBAgOUaa	you could ask them if they need/want someone. its hard to just "get noticed".

What I did (this might work for you) was to go out and approach some guitar players from local bands and ask for lessons. Alot of these guys teach on the side or may be willing to get together and work something out. This gives an opportunity to candidly meet these folks, build up a rapport and show them what you can do in an informal way - a sneaky way to audition. Once you break the ice with these guys and they have an idea of your attitude and aptitude, it doesn't hurt to start dropping hints. You may find yourself playing with them, or if like me - you may get successful referrals<br>  I did this this and it worked, it may not for you - the moral is, think outside the box. Find a way to get to know and befriend them.

FmbwIbtzaa	To the unbelieving materialist, man is simply an evolutionary accident. His hopes of survival are strung on a figment of mortal imagination; his fears, loves, longings, and beliefs are but the reaction of the incidental juxtaposition of certain lifeless atoms of matter. No display of energy nor expression of trust can carry him beyond the grave. The devotional labors and inspirational genius of the best of men are doomed to be extinguished by death, the long and lonely night of eternal oblivion and soul extinction. Nameless despair is man's only reward for living and toiling under the temporal sun of mortal existence. Each day of life slowly and surely tightens the grasp of a pitiless doom which a hostile and relentless universe of matter has decreed shall be the crowning insult to everything in human desire which is beautiful, noble, lofty, and good.

THE ETERNAL AND DIVINE PURPOSE<br>  <br>            There is a great and glorious purpose in the march of the universes through space. All of your mortal struggling is not in vain. We are all part of an immense plan, a gigantic enterprise, and it is the vastness of the undertaking that renders it impossible to see very much of it at any one time and during any one life. We are all a part of an eternal project which the Gods are supervising and outworking. The whole marvelous and universal mechanism moves on majestically through space to the music of the meter of the infinite thought and the eternal purpose of the First Great Source and Center.<br>  <br>            The eternal purpose of the eternal God is a high spiritual ideal. The events of time and the struggles of material existence are but the transient scaffolding which bridges over to the other side, to the promised land of spiritual reality and supernal existence. Of course, we mortals find it difficult to grasp the idea of an eternal purpose; we are virtually unable to comprehend the thought of eternity, something never beginning and never ending.

Ok, bad joke. he guy who mention depression is up to something there. People mood are cyclical. You will have happy times and very bad time through your life. Thar's just the way the cookie crumbles as they say. My advice is to keep busy. Busy people have little time to get depress. Get a constructive hobby, join a yoga class or better yet an MMA class. Get a job and this is not an insult. The trick here is a job you like. It will keep you entertain assuming you like your job. It can have the opposite effect if you don't like it. Get a boyfriend, or girlfriend or both. Hey, whatever swing your boat!!!<br>  <br>  Setting goals helps a lot. Do both long term goals and short term goals and even medium term goals. For example 6 month ago I made it a goal to make it to february 13 because that was when the new friday the 13th movie was released. I waited 6 months for it. Now I saw it and it was pretty good. Yes, it doesn't have to be something earth shattering goals. The world is not going to end because of friday the 13th.

"if you got it, flaunt it"... etc. Immoralities everywhere rationalized because its self-serving.<br>  <br>  If I think society needs to change.... then act to change it.

ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	Don’t Underestimate Your Pinky<br>  <br>  In almost every chord you form, the little finger can come into play and change a plain major or minor chord into a sixth, a seventh, a ninth, even an eleventh chord.<br>  <br>  Take the basic F major chord, the one in the first fret that is always a bear to learn for the beginner. Take that little finger and snap it down on the second string, third fret. You have F6 or Dm, depending, of course, which root note you emphasize.<br>  <br>  Slide the little finger up to the fourth fret, same second string and you have F7. There is one chord, that to some pickers, sounds mysterious, but it is a simple, yet harmonious one to use—F sus 4.<br>  <br>  “Sus” means sustained, another way of saying to let that note ring out just a bit louder than the rest of the chord. To nail that F sus 4, simply place your little finger on the third string, third fret that is directly beneath your ring finger. Playing a Bb note, which is what you have, makes the chord of F turn into F sus 4.<br>  <br>  So, how can you determine the sustained note for any chord you wish?  That is easy too. Using the diatonic scale of any major or minor chord, you will find the fourth note by running up the scale as in do, re, me, fa. Fa is your fourth note. In example, to obtain a G sus 4, you pin the C note down to get it.<br>  <br>  Another important use for the little finger when using chord formations is tackling what I call the “long A”—when you barre the first four strings in the second fret and slap your little finger on the first string, fifth fret. Here is where it can get exciting. Keep your forefinger in place on the second fret as you hammer, slide, and lift off the little finger on every string in the formed chord. There are no rigid rules to follow; just what your mind and ears tell you to do. At first, your pinky won’t cooperate, but in time you will be able to move it separately from the rest of your fingers.<br>  <br>  When performing your “power chords” you can use the little finger to hammer down the remainder of the chord, and if you make a miswhack, you’ll have played the major 6th. And even when you’re playing diminished 7th chords, the little finger is crucial to hot licks.<br>  <br>  In essence, your little finger brings magic to dull chords. I can almost guarantee you will like this method. Try it and see. <br>  <br>  Keep pickin ‘n grinnin’.|`|i7dKy6rGaa	All you have to do is just use it.

2dWlUEimaa	The term sophist is derived from the Greek word "sophia" which means wisdom. Theoretically, then, a sophist should be a person who is truly wise. Realistically, however, sophists were anything but that. The sophists relied on purposefully complex and confusing rhetoric to trick the listeners into agreeing with whatever the sophist was arguing in support of.<br>  <br>  At the time of Socrates, self-proclaimed sophists traveled around the Greek city-states teaching their "sophia" to the rich and young (actually, they really were just teaching others how to be sophists as well), all for a fee of course.<br>  <br>  As you are probably aware, Socrates wasn't too fond of people who claimed to be knowledgable but in fact were not. The story goes, Socrates was perplexed when the Oracle said that Socrates is the wisest man alive. Socrates asked himself how it could be that he is the wisest man alive, when he acknowledges that the only thing he knows for sure is that he knows nothing. Socrates then began his search to find a man wiser than himself; he therefore sought out and ultimately interrogated those who claimed to be wise.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, Socrates discovered that the wisdom of all these so-called wise people, including the sophists, was superficial at best, and completely wrong at worst. The sophists were indeed the worst, because they were the most arrogant and had the greatest, most negative effect on the Greek populace: they didn't teach wisdom (how could they, as they had no wisdom themselves), but rather they taught how to take advantage of others through fancy speech (i.e. rhetoric).|`|U5nwTswfaa	Finally, someone has asked the right question!<br>  <br>  Sophistry is creating an overly complex argument that is designed to confuse.

NZmvHYY9aa	He used to be a news writer, covered a lot of strictly factitious things, and probably got used to writing that way, even when he wrote fiction. But as far a stylistic choice, Hemingway does not give even the slightest hint of embellishment or opinion--as my old English teacher said, "He tells the story and that's that." He also uses a device my teacher liked to call "The Thing Untold," where Hemingway knows something the reader doesn't, and writes with that thing in mind. Hemingway never includes the explanation itself, so it's up to the reader to make their own mind up about the character.<br>  <br>  Find  Mr. and Mrs. Elliott (I think that's the title) online, it's a famous Hemingway short story and one of the best examples of understatements and "The Thing Untold"|`|yjvv5bDjaa	because he was influenced by <br>  <br>  1) Gertruide Stein and<br>  2) Ezra Pound|`|U5TDVhBFaa	havent read that story,but in the hills are like elephants or whatever its called,and the bridge over smyrna,his words are totally understated/but dense with what is left unsaid-like the smyrna story- poeople are bieng tortured,killed, yet the writer does not express disdain or horror-like other authors would-he just refers to screams in the background or floating parts in the river.<br>  <br>  in the hills story- theres this part where she says we could have everything,and he says we do-but what it means and doesnt say-is she means-if they had the baby they could have everything-he is saying they do have everything and a baby would ruin it-<br>  <br>  his stories are like that- the meaning and what isnt said just scream at you-very emotionally dense-yet such concise,simple seemingly empty words.
fVxnoREUaa	The American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble (1889-1953) established the scale of the universe and laid the observational basis for the cosmological theory of the expanding universe.<br>  <br>  Edwin Hubble was born on Nov. 20, 1889, in Marshfield, Mo., where his father, a lawyer, was in the insurance business. Hubble received scholarship aid to go to the University of Chicago. He chose law for a career, and after receiving his bachelor's degree in 1910, he went as a Rhodes scholar to Oxford University, England. In 1913 he returned to the United States, was admitted to the bar in Kentucky, and practiced law for about a year in Louisville.<br>  <br>  Quite suddenly, Hubble decided that he would devote his life to astronomy, and in 1914 he left for the University of Chicago's Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wis. In 1917 he completed his doctorate and enlisted in the infantry. He served in France as a line officer in the American Expeditionary Force.<br>  <br>  Early Work at Mount Wilson<br>  <br>  As a student at Chicago, Hubble had attracted the attention of the well-known astronomer G. E. Hale, and after the war Hale offered him a staff position at Mount Wilson Observatory near Pasadena, Calif. Except for the period 1942-1946, when Hubble was with the Ordnance Department in Aberdeen, Md., he was connected with the Mount Wilson Observatory for the rest of his life.<br>  <br>  Hubble's early observations at Mount Wilson were made with its 60-inch reflecting telescope and concentrated on objects within our own galaxy, for example, novae, nebulous stars, and variable stars. Gradually he began to observe more distant objects. To determine the distances of the spiral nebulae (galaxies), he used Cepheid variable stars. This method derived from Henrietta S. Leavitt's 1912 discovery that the period of variation in the intensity of these stars is directly related to their absolute magnitude, so that by measuring the former, one may easily determine the latter. By knowing the star's absolute magnitude and measuring its apparent magnitude, its (relative) distance may be readily calculated from the inverse-square law.<br>  <br>  In 1923 Hubble definitely recognized a Cepheid variable in the Andromeda Nebula, known to astronomers as M31. Others were soon found in M31 and its companion nebula M33. To obtain his photographs, Hubble used Mount Wilson's 100-inch telescope. Once he had located the variables and determined their periods and apparent magnitudes, he used Leavitt's period-luminosity relationship to determine their distances. He concluded that the great spiral Andromeda Nebula is roughly 900,000 light-years away, a fantastically large distance, placing it clearly outside our own galaxy and proving that, in general, galaxies are islands in the universe. To allow for interstellar absorption, Hubble's distance estimate had to be later reduced to roughly 750,000 light-years, a figure that stood until shortly before Hubble's death.<br>  <br>  Hubble continued to determine galactic distances and to study galactic characteristics. By 1925 he had enough observations to propose a scheme for their classification: he imagined concentrated, very luminous, spheroidal galaxies to merge into ellipsoidal ones, which in turn branched into "normal spirals" on the one hand, and "barred spirals" on the other. Hubble tended to avoid drawing evolutionary conclusions from his scheme, but it was clearly very suggestive in that direction. Furthermore, it proved invaluable in statistical studies of the universe. At the time of his death, Hubble was attempting to revise his scheme in order to make it more complete.<br>  <br>  Expanding Universe<br>  <br>  In the late 1920s Hubble laid the observational groundwork for the most spectacular astronomical discovery of this century: the expanding universe. V. M. Silpher had, over a period of years, made spectroscopic observations on tens of nebulae (galaxies) which indicated, on the basis of the Doppler shifts recorded, that these nebulae were receding from the earth at velocities between roughly 300 and 1,800 kilometers per second. Hubble realized the great importance of Silpher's observations for cosmological theories and organized a plan for measuring both the distances and (radial) velocities of as many galaxies as possible, down to the faintest ones detectable with Mount Wilson's 100-inch telescope.<br>  <br>  While an assistant, M. L. Humason photographed galactic spectra and analyzed the observed Doppler shifts. Hubble photographed the galaxies themselves, searched for Cepheid variable stars, and computed the distances to the galaxies. By 1929 Hubble had distance data on Silpher's nebulae and announced what became known as Hubble's law: the velocity of recession of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from the earth. By the early 1940s this law had been confirmed for galactic velocities up to roughly 45,000 kilometers per second, corresponding to galactic distances up to roughly 220 million light-years.<br>  <br>  During the 1930s Hubble became more and|`|XbvQiEDxaa	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm give me some time
U0LPJ2Puaa	Definition of Allegory (American Heritage Dictionary)<br>  The representation of abstract ideas or principles by characters, figures, or events in narrative, dramatic, or pictorial form. <br>  A story, picture, or play employing such representation. John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and Herman Melville's Moby Dick are allegories. <br>  A symbolic representation: The blindfolded figure with scales is an allegory of justice. <br>  <br>  You are correct.  Aslan is like Jesus (rises from the dead) The White Witch is like Satan with all her minions and demons, etc.  The story was read to us in my old christian elementary school and has been praised by several different christian tv channels.|`|NZmvHYY9aa	Yeah, it's a Biblical allegory, specifically the crucifixion of Jesus. An allegory is a symbolic narrative--most of or all of the characters symbolize something else.<br>  <br>  Aslan=Jesus<br>  Edmund=sinners; sin (Aslan died for Edmund)<br>  Lucy and Susan=women at the resurrection<br>  Smashing of the Stone Table=resurrection; splitting of the tomb<br>  White Witch=some dispute; some say she represents the Devil, others say simply temptation|`|qnMx8lZzaa	An allegory is a metaphor that has been sufficiently developed into a story.<br>  Aslan or the lion is a direct reflection through an allegorical veil of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, or Christ.<br>  The children throughout all the tales represent how we need to find courage to follow the right path through the risk of life.<br>  All the stories are fashioned around the questions we "faithful" all ask at some time, "God, are you real to me?" and "What would you have me do?"<br>  These really are not meant to be childish tales. If they appeal to you. I suggest you read them all as a collection. You might also read the stories written by C.S. Lewis' friend, George MacDonald. I suggest Lillith as a good adult oriented story that will lead you to ask yourself what you believe about faith and evil.

fbd87c7846199694ba9130c99b6e261caa	Ultimately musical theatre training is just that. If the school is good you will leave with a great understanding of your voice, dance and acting for musicals. Acting will give you a more broad background but will not necessarily advance your skills for musicals.  Ideally you will work towards being the good ole triple threat and work on your acting, singing and dancing skills. <br>  <br>  If you have a great singing voice and can dance then perhaps focus on the musical theatre training but if either of those areas are weak then focusing on acting only may be your best bet.|`|N8zJERG5aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I would advise to become an acting major as it's more broad (more opportunities) & will provide you in good stead if you wish to move into musical theater.  In your spare time you can research musical theater further to gain a better insight & perhaps there could be opportunities to move into that area down the track.

The Trojans held out the siege until the Greek trick of the Trojan Horse did them in.  <br>  This is all told in the wonderful tale written by the poet Homer called "The Iliad."|`|HAEjoPVRaa	The Trojans attacked a lot of people. Troy, which was known as Wilusa during the Late Bronze Age but the Hittites, was a vassal of the great Hittite Empire. Under King Alaksandus they signed a treaty with the Hittites saying that they would support the Hittites with a certain number of troops and chariots (the numbers are not specified on the remaining tablets). <br>  <br>  In Hittite records the Trojans did not attack anyone by themselves but they did take part in the battle at Kadesh. Ramesses The Great records that Wilusans, under Alaksandus, were present at the battle. The Battle of Kadeush took place around 1290 BCE and between 40 and 90 years later the Trojan War took place.<br>  <br>  The Trojan War is an iffy historical fact. We know something took place there but battles between the Ahhiyawa (Greeks as called by the Hittites) and Wilusa took place over more like 200 years. Wilusa is not exact but if we take the words of the Iliad true, than the Greeks attacked the neighboring countries for the first nine years and only in the tenth did they attack Troy. In this sense, the Greeks attacks on the Arzawa Lands, the Seha River Lands, and Milliwanda (Miletus) make sense.<br>  <br>  According to myth the Trojan prince Paris captured, or seduced Helen, starting the Trojan War. This can be seen as an attack but in reality either Troy did attack some sort of Greek outpost, perhaps under the command of the Hittites, or simply the Greeks wanted more land after being deposed from Milliwanda which took place around 1220 BCE. it is also possible that the war was ignited over a woman, although very unlikely. In the city of Ugarit, a war was almost started over a women because of some messy adultery after a marriage between Uragit and Carchemish (although i may have this town wrong).<br>  <br>  So, in conclusion, the Trojans probably were quite active in the Late Bronze Age, at least participating in the Battle of Kadesh and the "Trojan War". However, to say they openly attacked another nation without the consent or command of the Hittites is probably false. Because they were a vassal, most likely everything they did had some connection with the desires of the Hittites and their Great King.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|gfmTgLDKaa	Note: Greeks=Achaeans in this source:<br>  <br>  In Greek mythology, the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans after Paris of Troy stole Helen from her husband Menelaus, the king of Sparta. The war is among the most important events in Greek mythology, and was narrated in many works of Greek literature, including the Iliad and the Odyssey by Homer. The Iliad relates a part of the last year of the siege of Troy, while the Odyssey describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the Achaean leaders. Other parts of the war were told in a cycle of epic poems, which has only survived in fragments. Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature, and for Roman poets like Virgil and Ovid.<br>  <br>  The war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Athena, Hera and Aphrodite, after Eris, the goddess of strife and discord, gave them a golden apple, sometimes known as the apple of Discord, marked "for the fairest". Zeus sent the goddesses to Paris, who judged that Aphrodite, as the "fairest", should receive the apple. In exchange, Aphrodite made Helen, the most beautiful of all women and wife of Menelaus, fall in love with Paris, who took her to Troy. Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and the brother of Helen's husband Menelaus, led an expedition of Achaean troops to Troy and besieged the city for ten years because of Paris' insult. After the deaths of many heroes, including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax, and the Trojans Hector and Paris, the city fell to the ruse of the Trojan Horse. The Achaeans slaughtered the Trojans (except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves) and desecrated the temples, thus earning the gods' wrath. Few of the Achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shores. The Romans later traced their origin to Aeneas, one of the Trojans, who was said to have led the surviving Trojans to modern day Italy.<br>  <br>  The Ancient Greeks thought the Trojan War was a historical event that had taken place in the 13th or 12th century BC, and believed that Troy was located in modern day Turkey near the Dardanelles. By modern times both the war and the city were widely believed to be non-historical. In 1870, however, the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann excavated a site in this area which he identified as Troy; this claim is now accepted by most scholars.[1][citation needed] Whether there is any historical reality behind the Trojan War is an open question. Many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale, though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age. Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War derive from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC, often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes, 1194–1184 BC, which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa.[2]|`|EuGgzd1naa	the greeks|`|atMMeNcCaa	the Trojans were part of the Persian Empire and they attacked Greece starting the Trojan War because they thought they could win but they didnt know about Sparta's amazingly trained army the war lasted i thin kit was 14 years not sure though

AA12339318	No problem using reference images for an illustration.  I do that all the time. But, I avoid copyright images by NOT, simply tracing or modifying a photograph.<br>  <br>  In your case, especially for an image as simple and easily identifyable as a clownfish, what I suggest you do is to find LOTS of pictures of clownfish, and do a lot of different sketches from those photographs.  If you do enough of them, your hand and eye will be trained to recognize those characteristics (other than the color) that make in a clownfish.<br>  <br>  Then, when you think you have the images looking fairly accurate, then, without a photograh in front of you, make a quick sketch, from memory of a clownfish.  When done, compare your latest sketch to the other photograps to see how anatomically accurate your drawing is.  Go ahead and make corrections where needed.  When your illustration is completed, you can rest assured that you have, in fact, created and original drawing of a clownfish, needing no credit to any of the photographers.  As long as your finished entry is not a direct copy of any of the photos, it IS an original.|`|bdrEZSJfaa	You should contact whoever is running the contest and ask what their rules are for using reference pieces. <br>  And then even if they say to go ahead, and that you don't need to even mention reference pieces, it would be the decent thing to give credit to the photographer anyway.

But yeah I could go on and on about how good it is, but my advice is to get the SG.|`|645f18865ac05bd21df6fca545da961daa	Ibanez GRX40.<br>  <a href="http://www.ibanez.co.jp/la/products/jumpstart/GRX40J.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibanez.co.jp/la/products/jump...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ibanez.com/product.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibanez.com/product.aspx</a><br>  <br>  Epiphone SG 400<br>  <a href="http://www.epiphone.com/default.asp?ProductID=24&CollectionID=16" rel="nofollow">http://www.epiphone.com/default.asp?Prod...</a><br>  <a href="http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/SG/Epiphone.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric...</a><br>  <br>  suggest keeping the Ibanez as is, and try newer Epiphone,<br>  _________<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fender.com/products/search.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fender.com/products/search.ph...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.yamaha.com/guitars/electrics/0,,CTID%25253D600001,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yamaha.com/guitars/electrics/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marshallamps.com/product_overview.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.marshallamps.com/product_over...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.peavey.com/products/amps.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.peavey.com/products/amps.cfm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.voxamps.com/us/products/" rel="nofollow">http://www.voxamps.com/us/products/</a><br>  ..|`|hpxc5szsaa	i dunno man...|`|i7dKy6rGaa	I would Get the Epiphone Sg.

bC3eBo0aaa	I am a clarinet player and when I was a senior in high school I had my wisdom teeth removed.  The "blowing up" thing is a very real danger called dry socket. If air bubbles get in the holes where your wisdom teeth were, they can get infected. This did not happen to me, but it is VERY painful, as my oral surgeon told me.  I don't believe you have given yourself enough time to heal. It sucks not to play, but if you are playing now and it is uncomfortable then you should stop immediately.  I did not play for 3 weeks and it was still uncomfortable when I started again.  You should really be consulting your surgeon about this.  He will know what to do, you are probably not the first musician he has done surgery on.  You really need to ask at least your dentist. Best of luck!!|`|YvXYDiBcaa	when my friend got her wisdom teeth removed, she couldn't play her clarinet for about a week after.  By 11 days i think you would be fine but you will just have to wait and see as everyone heals differently.  Try playing a little bit more each day (though not the first few days, that could hurt) and see if you can do it.

zE6dSwkQaa	If you want to be a professional, then you are probably too old. But if you want to just have fun and learn ballet, you are DEFINITELY not too old.|`|nLhoD2VGaa	it is never too late to learn! just make sure you look in to the class you sign up for. most dance studios have 3 different types of ballet classes: junior, senior, and youth. try a senior class, which means 13+. i started dancing when i was 14, and i haven't regretted it for a moment!  even though lots of girls start as early as 3, dance is still a great way to get exercise and express yourself, even if you start a little later than most. one thing to keep in mind is that you will not get super good super fast. ballet takes practice and time, but be patient and if you are passionate about ballet, go for it!|`|9wpQ6Hb5aa	This is exactly the age I started taking ballet, and so far I love it.

PwfS4T74aa	I suggest you drop the idea. Pointe takes a long time to get good at, and without formal ballet training, you'll risk messing up, as well as injuring yourself, by preforming Pointe.<br>  <br>  You can injure yourself either by falling and twisting your ankle during your preformance/practice, or you'll ruin your preformance all together because your feet/ankles will be too sore and swollen  from practice for you to walk correctly, let alone dance<br>  <br>  You need the balance of an elite gymnast and really strong ankles to preform Pointe, and since you've never takenBallet, I doubt you have either of those...|`|nLhoD2VGaa	well, you should NEVER use point shoes unless you are properly trained. you can cause MAJOR injuries to yourself! unless you are properly trained you can strain or break you ankles, because they are not strong and trained enough. also, im not sure how you would only do part of the performance with them and then take them off... good luck on your talent show!|`|uZo5cLscaa	Please, drop the idea. Even if you are only going to be on pointe for "10 seconds max" you can severely injure yourself without proper training. It takes many, many years of training before you can go on pointe. I know very skilled dancers who have had to stop dancing or severely cut back on classes in the year due to severe pointe injuries, and these are girls who have been training for over 12 years. I don't think that any pointe shoes are good for someone who isn't really on pointe. please, drop the idea.|`|ccnoxnzYaa	No way. Pointe looks easy, but it takes years of ballet. I have been in ballet for about 8 years and I am just now starting pre pointe. I will have to be in pre pointe for about a year before I can even start wearing pointe shoes. You could seriously twist your foot and permanently damage it. Do not embarrass yourself.|`|PnzNcKoeaa	If you want to persue dance drop it or else you will really hurt yourself<br>  <br>  <br>  You should tke ballet and strengthen your ankles so maybe you can do it latter and not injure yourself to wear you are screwed

C77c0OE2aa	In most cases there are three reasons why a camera will not focus.<br>  <br>  1. You are too close to the subject. All lenses have a minimum focus distance. Be sure you are not closer than this distance.<br>  <br>  2. Not enough light. The auto focus needs a certain amount of light in able to focus. A standard kit lens does not have a very wide aperture and this makes it even more difficult for the auto focus to work. You should see a red beam from the camera in dim conditions trying to illuminate the subject for focus. You can often just shine a flashlight on the subject long enough to achieve focus. Once focus is obtained, put the camera in manual focus to maintain the focus. A fast lens, such as with a minimum aperture of 2.8 will help a lot in dim auto focus conditions. <br>  <br>  3. Not enough contrast on the subject. For instance, it is almost impossible for a camera to auto focus on a flat wall that is all one color and texture. There is no varience of texture or tone for the focus to lock in on. In those cases, you have to switch to manual focus and focus the lens yourself.<br>  <br>  steve|`|Yjn1T4mNaa	are you too close to the subject? if you're too close then step back a little. Or you can step back kind of far and then zoom in. (If you zoom in, be sure to set your ISO to 800 or 1600.) or there might not be enough light? try lowering the aperture value to something large like 1.4, 1.8, 2.8 (Unless your lens aperture is not built that wide, so set it to the lowest number like 3.5) you could also accidentally have set the lens to manual focus instead of auto focus. There's a switch on the side of the lens that you could set from MF to AF.
AA10015648	Making a gold effect is more than just color.. it's getting the right highlight and shadow.<br>  <br>  Make your text yellow... not bright yellow, a little darkish. Then double click that layer, and click "bevel" - it will give a 3d effect. Now, it'll default to a yellowish color for the highlight, but you want it to go MAX! so make it a bright yellow. Make the shadow color barely there - gold reflects a lot, so there shouldn't be a reason for a huge shadow. Now, bring the size down to like 1 or 2... you don't want the effect to be gigantic.<br>  <br>  Then, select "gradient overlay" - it'll go black and white for a sec, but just use the dropdown box to say "overlay" instead of "normal" - it'll give it a glossy look to it. You can make the opacity go up or down depending on how extreme you want that effect.<br>  <br>  Good luck! It won't look perfect, but it won't look horrible, either!
UY4jSACoaa	that all depends on what you have access to. if  you go to a university then you'll most likely have access to lots of scholarly journals and that helps a lot. if you're depending solely on the internet and libraries then your choices are a little more limited. plus it depends on what kind of novel you like in the first place. <br>  <br>  i just did a critical analysis on ethen frome by edith wharton. it was an easy, short read and the themes were really easy to write about. like determinism, realism, and naturalism. but since it's not wharton's most famous book, you might not be able to find that much about it. <br>  <br>  anything by charles dickens is easy to find info on. my suggestion would be great expectations. its a tad long but it's hilarious. themes in this books are class anxiety and criminality, among others.<br>  <br>  some more easy reads would be 1982 or animal farm by george orwell. i've never had to write a paper on them but they were fun and i'll bet you'll be able to find plenty on these super popular novels.<br>  <br>  good luck!

XOnSRoR2aa	There are many themes in Othello - love, racism, betrayal, misogyny, prejudices -  but I think the main one is the destructive power of jealousy. <br>  <br>  I read Othello my freshman year and no longer have my copy or study guides, but there are plenty of resources online that can help you find all the evidence needed to support the theme. <br>  <br>  Here are a few links:<br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-othello/themes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-othel...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/othello/themes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ot...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/othello/study-guide/major-themes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/othello/study-...</a><br>  <a href="http://isc.temple.edu/ihfaculty/IH51/FacultyforFaculty/othellothemes.htmhttp://www.novelguide.com/othello/themeanalysis.html" rel="nofollow">http://isc.temple.edu/ihfaculty/IH51/Fac...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/Othello-Critical-Essays-Major-Themes-in-Othello.id-138,pageNum-253.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  There are many more, so if these don't help, keep Googling. <br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  <br>  ~ Pax / Peace|`|suxCcXkAaa	Like the person above said, there are many themes in Othello--jealousy, race, masculinity, and much more.

f4Nn0W1xaa	I think your question is based on a fallacy. I think that those same "Tom, Dick, and Harrys"  who judge the quality of what they read feel equally qualified to judge what they hear and see. <br>  <br>  More people read books, of whatever quality, than listen to classical music or delve into the mysteries of fine art. Books are more democratic. Look around you; they're everywhere, from the airport to the grocery store. I talk about books with all manner of people. Symphonies rarely come up, frankly, nor does art.<br>  <br>  Sure, plenty of us are literature snobs and it pains us to hear people say that War and Peace is boring and J.K. Rowling is a genius but the fact of the matter is plenty of people would rather own a velvet Elvis than the Mona Lisa, or listen to the Jonas Brothers over Beethoven too. <br>  <br>  I am very confident in my ability to judge the merit of a book but that does not mean that I believe my word to be law. Yes, it may be a better book, objectively, but if the reader hates it he will derive no value from it. No one will ever convince me that King, Koontz, Patterson, etal., are good authors but you will also never find me telling people not to read and defend what they truly enjoy. It does me no damage and it apparently makes them happy. What's the harm in that?<br>  <br>  I truly enjoy leading horses to the water of the words I value but you will never catch me dead trying to shame them into drinking it.<br>  <br>  ***Edit) Thank you, KK. That's very kind.<br>  <br>  Bravo, Vet! Beautiful answer!|`|uGmEjSLDaa	I can't add much to what reader said, but I will add the following: I think that people think 'If I can read, I can write.' Since writing is perceived as a more mechanical task (putting pen to paper, or clicking keys on the computer) than in being Paganini on a violin, or painting like Caravaggio, there's an assumption that anyone can be a writer, while not just anyone can be a great violinist or a great painter.<br>  <br>  You can argue that drawing the bow on the violin, or drawing the sketch on the paper, is equally mechanical as an action, and it is--but it's not perceived as such, and thus people think that writing is 'easier.'<br>  <br>  Absent any evidence for my following claim, I'd argue that there probably have been millions more stories written than symphonies composed or paintings painted, so it IS more democratic of an art form as well.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it's more subjective. I know writing I dislike when I see it--but unless something is truly execrable, people may disagree with me on it. It may be harder to disagree on the merits of a well-painted painting (Rococo bores me, but I can recognize it's well-painted) or a well-composed symphony (most Romantic composers likewise bore me, but I can recognize a well-composed piece of music) than on the merits of a well-told story. What I want in it is assuredly not what a Harlequin Romance reader wants in it, and the deluge of books compared to music or art ensures that the Harlequin reader and I have room in which to disagree.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Quite possibly the same thing that makes you believe that you are qualified to judge people who judge books;-)<br>  <br>  I would probably be quite happy to judge the merit of a painting or a symphony (actually I've slammed Andre Rieu on many occasions,) but do not have the same level of interest in painting or music as I do in literature. That is why I chose to study English Literature at university and not Art or Music.<br>  <br>  As Reader suggests, the difference between Literature and other art forms is that it is more accessible. You only need to go as far as the local service station to pick up a cheap paperback, or you can access them at the local library. However, I have never claimed that my opinions on Literature are accurate or, indeed, anything more than subjective. They are just opinions. Everyone else on Y!A has the right to disagree with me or prove me wrong.|`|YorMkZYAaa	Reader said it all and then some. Absolutely brilliant answer. I'll edit this in the morning with my thoughts. I have a few floating in my head but nothing worth articulating or anything that makes sense.|`|vAhBLK06aa	It is my opinion that there is art in everything one does whether it is visual, physical and preforming or audio. Art is in the eye of the beholder and I agree that some who give one form of art high merits haven't a clue as to other art forms and give it/them low merit, and then the ones they do give high points to are really not that great on the whole, but to that individual(s).<br>  The written word is an art form whether it is a document or a best selling novel, except to me when it is convoluted and doesn't make any sense, or is like the spoken word for instance from a politician for example full of double talk and waffling, yet that persons back benchers and some supporting of that party or individual reporters tout it as brilliant.<br>  You are right, many of those who believe they have the pulse on literature (especially those who are paid to do so and have a degree in liturature) have a tin ear for music such as symphony, dull sense of humour for comedy, little insight to drama, and have poor balance to enjoy dance.<br>  Yet these same person(s) may tear apart a beautifully done performance so that others will not take a chance to judge for themselves and still give high acclaim to a written rag putting it in the top 10 'must read' and waste people's money purchasing it.<br>  "Water World" directed and staring Kevin Costner was torn apart by the critics. Even hearing what they said I paid to see it and I really enjoyed it; I judged for myself.|`|AHJQfHx9aa	I read this question last night while I was feeling irie, and it sort of bummed me out.<br>  <br>  This is a very sad question.<br>  <br>  The most obvious reason that a lot of people feel comfortable discussing literature is because most people are still given an introductory education on what sort of things to look for and judge literature by.  They are taught basic principles, encouraged to apply them, and allowed to practice them.<br>  <br>  Art and music, however, have basically been cut right out of our school systems.  You can take electives, but who wants to?  Frankly, our society is embarrassingly ignorant of the finer arts, musically and visually.<br>  <br>  And that isn't something to be happy about, it's a travesty that damages art overall.  The less interest and discussion there is about any art the less it will advance.  By cutting education of art, and by discouraging elementary discussion of it we only damage the advancement of that art.  Who cares if someone only has, "I like it a lot," to say about what they just read, heard, or saw?  Why does someone need to have a $50,000 vocabulary to have a valid opinion?  That is a horrible fallacy that hurts all of society.  <br>  <br>  So my answer to the why here is:  Because people are allowed to develop at least a rudimentary understanding of how to evaluate what they read and aren't given those tools for art or music.<br>  <br>  And my suggestion to people who feel like they have passions for any area of art is to start getting other people involved in it.  Art is not something to be snotty about, or feel superior because of, it's something that we need to share with each other and encourage.  It's a key to social advancement and community building.  We need to walk out of the Ivory Tower mentality and bring our passion to the potato fields and try to spread it.<br>  <br>  People who hoard knowledge, and judge people for not having it are societal cancers.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	I don't hear many people who think they are qualified to judge the artistic merit of a a piece of literature. Mostly what I hear is "oh it was real good" with reference to a particular book without any notion of how to support such a statement. <br>  <br>  People say "I loved it!" but they cannot elaborate on what it was they loved, why they found the book appealing, etc. They just "love it" or "hate it." It's just a gut level response with nothing to back it up. Few people have the background or experience necessary to judge any kind of writing.<br>  <br>  I think that writing, though, is more accessible to many people than is painting or classical music. Since they have less exposure, they have less to say (thankfully).<br>  <br>  That's my take on it. I only know a few people to whom I'll listen when it comes to book recommendations. I find, too, that a lot of people who are over effusive about a particular book ("The 'DaVinci Code' is the best book ever!") don't actually read but rather follow the other sheep around.|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	Can  just say that I'm reading The DaVinci Code right now, and it's not all that it's hyped up to be. Just to add on to what patticharron was saying.<br>  <br>  Anyways, like others said, reader really got this one.<br>  <br>  The thing is, most people don't look at books as art. They see it as just a story. And as reader said, books are everywhere and in SO many different forms (from YA to children's to How-To's to adult to religious to classics) that it's hard to look at every book critically, when some aren't meant to be. I know a lot of us really hammer on Twilight, including me, but the truth is that it's not meant to be looked at so critically. Yes, it should at least be well written, but we can't help that now. <br>  <br>  The point is, a lot of books nowadays are just for entertainment, and nothing more. But things like art and symphonies are things that people recognize as "above their level" that they know they can't understand. How many people think that if you can tell what something is and it's painted/drawn well, as in clean-cut, it's art? And that a canvas with paint thrown onto it isn't? People can normally understand most books, because they're *made* to be understandable.<br>  <br>  That said, literature *is* a democratic art form. If it weren't, we wouldn't have so many vampire books out right now. Did you notice that with teens, vampires are very and extremely in? I see them everywhere and it's a result of Twilight's success. Of course, vampire books were around before Twilight, but I happened to notice a few months ago that a publishing company put out these certain vampire books I'd read a year or two ago with newer, flashier covers to attract more attention. Because YA readers want vampires, and they want cool vampies. How can you not call this a democracy?<br>  <br>  It's true that not everyone can accurately judge the artistic merit of a piece of literature. That's entirely true. But you can't really blame them for it, since the media has transformed this specific type of art so that when someone reads a lot but reads nonsensical books that have little meaning, they think they're well-read and that they *are* qualified to judge literary merit. That's just how it is.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question :)<br>  <br>  Edit: And Vet is right. Everyone *is* entitled to their own opinion. If an English major says they like a certain book for certain reasons, and a high school student says they like a certain book for the same reasons, is the English major more right? Or if the English major doesn't like it for the opposite reasons, that the high school student is wrong?<br>  <br>  Art in general is a lot of opinion. This includes literature, art, and music. In art class, we've had SO many class discussions about what art is, and have never gotten anywhere. I always find myself walking in circles with my points, because it's not a straightforward topic. Literature is no different. Sure, some people are better at analyzing than others who might not realize that you should analyze at all, but in the end, it's still just a bunch of opinions. <br>  <br>  And again, this makes it democratic. The only thing that makes literature more democratic than other art forms is the fact that, as reader said, books are everywhere, as I said, books aren't always looked as art, and as Vet said, public schools don't educate students on art and music the same way they do with literature.

They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family tree, particularly their One World Tree program.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records.

The trick is that you get the fun to put them together, thus being sure of being correct. <br>  Example.. aunt mary says gr grandma died in 1947 in Detroit. You send for her death certificate, and find it was 1945 in Philly. Be nice to aunt mary.. don't tell her she messed up..but you use the document, not what is remembered. Your mom may not remember her grandma's maiden name..but we can teach you to find her in the census.

Of those 16, you may now find that 2 of them have been researched and are online. You gotta get back far enough to know them when you see them. Don't work a surname. You work persons and their actual connections. You don't want to search all the Smiths (or <insert name>) in the world.. you want to be explicit, and find the place where Joe Smith, who married Mary Jones in 1927, is buried. You need to look where he lived, and look in Florida cemeteries. <br>  Everything I am saying, shifts you from the idea of a family tree.. to pieces, records, way of thinking, and how to find it. Always use records, always work from today, back. for me, this is the one main idea I try to give new researchers. <br>  Now.. which records do you already have, and what do they show? <br>   Oh.. yeah, we here are free and love to help.

AA12376180	I am not an opera buff however my older brother was a baritone and sang professionally around Southern California before he passed away around twenty years ago. It was through him that I acquired my meager appreciation of opera.<br>  <br>  When I was in college all of the fine arts were in the same building so it was common to pass singers and dancers practicing in the hallways. You mentioned you had or are having a shy period. The only way I know to get over shyness is by performing in public. Most of the singers I know (including my brother) tended to be extroverts and were happiest when all eyes were on them. I play piano and tend to lean toward being an introvert.. However by playing in public as much as possible has eliminated my shyness.<br>  <br>  I am proud of you because you apparently have realized that opera is more than just standing on stage and singing. There is the theatre part and the languages involved and you tackeling these areas already. Good for you. <br>  <br>  I do not think you should wait to get a voice teacher. When you get a voice teacher get the best your budget will allow. Anyone can claim to be a music teacher, no license required and there are many teachers that should not be teaching at all. If you do not know of anyone, contact the Music Teachers Association in your area. I would look for a "been there done that" teacher. A teacher whose students win competitions.<br>  <br>  Another avenue to go along with all of the above would be to begin singing in church choirs. Many of the larger churches feature nonsecular miniature operas at various times of the year.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best, I can sense excitement and an urgency in your question. Time is precious, don't waste it.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	17 is definitely not too late. Since you haven't started training your voice a too young an age, you've probably not developed bad habits. Get yourself a good voice teacher outside of school (or see if your chorus teacher provides voice lessons - I did both), see if your high school offers any music theory classes and go see as much opera as you can. Signing up for theater class won't hurt - but you can wait and do that in college as well.<br>  <br>  Make sure you keep your body fit and strong - eat healthily. That will prepare you for the strenuously long vocal performances. <br>  <br>  All the best to you!|`|VeiCR9Kwaa	You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders. Most singers your age have difficulty understanding that their instrument is far from grown. They want to go out and conquer the world right away. You know you have until your early 30s before your voice really settles into its final state. That's plenty of time to learn lots and lots of things.<br>  <br>  I'd say go for your theater class to start, and don't worry about it being just Theater I. (You'll have three more years of life experience to draw on as opposed to the freshmen in that class!) The thing about acting and singing is, they often go together. Being a better actor can make you a better singer; likewise, having good vocal technique allows you to emote better. Particularly here in America, audiences demand their opera singers be good actors and move well on stage as opposed to the older European "park and bark" tradition.<br>  <br>  Also, see if you can find a good voice teacher in your area, one that you feel comfortable with, one that understands young voices and will help you establish good vocal technique. <br>  <br>  Of course, you'll want to start looking for a college or university with a good vocal program right away, too. Good luck.|`|ly2V2k2Vaa	If you don't try out Theatre, you'll never know! Try it and see if you are good at it, and if you are, I see no reason why you wouldn't have a chance.

I don't believe that there is a consciousness "guiding" me.|`|Bsb9ALqgaa	Machiavellian more like. Psychology is a technique for dealing with the alienation that arises when you deny the existence of heaven and god. If you deny the existence of god and heaven and rely on the information of your senses you fall into a materialilstic philosophy which is the philosophy which is taken for granted in the modern west. Materialistic philosophy says that this life is all there is and leads us to wonder if there is any point in being alive because it's all so boring. It's plus side is it denies there is any real consequences in being immoral so you can do what you like and consume as much as you like without feeling too guilty about it. That only holds good if you are a powerful member of society because if you are not then you will get arrested and put behind bars and the poor don't benefit from materialism or nihilism as some would call it.<br>  <br>  It is totally unnecessary to deny god, hell, heaven or anything else like that because there is absolutely no proof of the objective existence or non existence of any of them. Its a total wasted effort. The only "proof" is if you experience for yourself life as being heavenly or that you have become a god then you can know for certain what it is like. I hasten to add that there is no such animal as the "Creator God" so you can't experience him I mean more like the Greek type gods. Becoming one of those is not as unlikely as it sounds because in both the Hindu and Buddhist religions it is said that heaven can be discovered through meditation in this very life. <br>  <br>  So you can accept behavioural psychology, Sigmund Freud, Charles Darwin, post modern conceptual art and fairies at the bottom of the garden and still have a profound experience and understanding of god and heaven.

AA12201622	Muhammad is the central prophet of the Islamic faith. Born into a noble Quraish (Quraysh) clan, he was orphaned at an early age. He grew up to be a successful merchant, then turned contemplative; it's said that beginning when he was 40, Muhammad was commanded by Allah (God) to recite the words that would later become Islam's holy book, the Qur'an (or Koran). As the revelations continued, Muhammad preached publicly of the duty to submit to the one true god, gaining followers and earning the enmity of the polytheistic authorities. To escape persecution, Muhammad was forced to flee in 622 to Yathrib (later called Medina). His poetic recitations and pleas for social justice continued to win converts, and Muhammad was repeatedly called into battle in his efforts to unite Arabia behind the faith known as Islam (meaning "submission"). After finally conquering Mecca in 630, Muhammad returned to Medina, where he died in 632.|`|7jqUpkIDaa	Hello once again lalala he dies in medina:]

r9s0VyJgaa	When the Roman Republic conquered Greece in 146 BC, it took much of Greek religion (along with many other aspects of Greek culture such as literary and architectural styles) and incorporated it into its own. The Greek gods were equated with the ancient Roman deities; Zeus with Jupiter, Hera with Juno, Poseidon with Neptune, Aphrodite with Venus, Ares with Mars, Artemis with Diana, Athena with Minerva, Hermes with Mercury, Hephaestus with Vulcan, Hestia with Vesta, Demeter with Ceres, Hades with Pluto, Tyche with Fortuna, and Pan with Faunus. Some of the gods, such as Apollo and Bacchus, had earlier been adopted by the Romans. There were also many deities that existed in the Roman religion before its interaction with Greece that weren't associated with a Greek deity, including Janus and Quirinus.<br>  <br>  In the late 4th century CE, the courts of the Roman Empire were predominantly Christian, as was most of the population.  The Christian emperors closed polytheistic oracles and temples, and ended the pagan games in a series of increasingly stringent decrees. Finally, the public practice of the Greek religion was made illegal by the Emperor Theodosius I and this was enforced by his successors. The Greek religion, stigmatized as "paganism", the religion of country-folk (pagani)—other scholars suggest the force of paganus was "(mere) civilian"—survived only in rural areas and in forms that were submerged in Christianized rite and ritual, as Europe entered into the Dark Ages.|`|4lNq0GtMaa	I think the people in greece who still believe in Greek mythology do it more out of tradition rather than actual belief. yes there are some people who still worship zeus, hera, and all the rest of the gods but for the most part i believe that they know they dont actually exist.|`|HAEjoPVRaa	Greece is now mainly Greek Orthodox so it is a christian nation.

BBfIXcI0aa	You don't really need to fake cry. If you have a play where you're crying and it's absolutely necessary (i.e. someone mentions it), there should be sufficient buildup in the script for you to get tied up enough in the situation that you'll really be crying by the time it comes along.<br>  <br>  It's easier to stay in character if you're in character the whole time, not just when you have to say your lines. Go through the script, look at each scene, and figure out what it is your character is trying to get in that scene - what his/her goal is. Then, think about the different ways he/she tries to get that goal, the tactics he/she uses. When you're acting, think like your character, and logically step from one tactic to the next. If you don't understand why your character is making a choice, sit down and ponder it for awhile - what, in his or her past, makes her think that choosing that path would get him/her what they want? Sometime, sit down and write out your character's history, making up any important details the playwright doesn't give you. Think about the events that made him/her who they are, and think about events in your own life that they compare to - this will help you better connect.|`|kiD47XbTaa	When you're playing a character, and lets just say, your character's dog has just died and they are extremely upset. You have to develop in to that character so much, that this fictional event makes you cry naturally because you ARE this character. <br>  But if you don't exactly know how it would feel for your pet dog to die because you've never owned one, think of another sad event in your life, maybe somebody close to you has died or there's a sad song about life and death which makes you sad, whilst playing your character relate the dog's death to a sad event in your life and you will be able to relate to that character better which will mean that you will naturally cry, and it isn't forced. <br>  This is the only way to be able to cry. <br>  Something that really helps me is, before I do a sad scene, I listen to some sad music which helps me get into my character and when I get on stage/screen I already have that sadness built inside of me ready to be let out. <br>  <br>  Lastly, when you say you have trouble 'staying in the zone', something that really really helps me in knowing my lines like I know the alphabet, this will help you stay connected in a scene! Instead of thinking 'Oh crap, what's my next line'. <br>  <br>  I hope I've helped!<br>  Break a leg!|`|GwWiaWI7aa	Well hun, if your thinking of an acting job, just forget it theres no use.

ImaQxahzaa	Here is a few errors I found<br>  <br>  Well first The White Star Line wanted 3 new ships to compete with the Cunard Line. So it was the idea of The White Star Line not Harland & Wolff. <br>  <br>  You need to add something about The RMS Olympic and The HMHS Britannic, Titanic's sister ships and how the HMHS Britannic sank in World War 1.<br>  <br>  Titanic Did Not have a Double Hull. It was after Titanic sank that a double hull was put on Britannic and Olympic was retro-fitted.<br>  <br>  Nether Harland & Wolff nor The White Star Line claimed that the Titanic was unsinkable that was all the press's doing.<br>  <br>  You need to redo the parts about the rivets. In the early 1900s rivets where installed with a worker on one side with a cupped tool to hold the rivet in place and on the other side was another worker with a pneumatic hammer to pound the red hot rivet in to place. The reason the rivets failed was that there was the carbon content in the steal was too high.<br>  <br>  If you want to be precise the length was 882.9 feet long, 92.0 feet wide 59 feet from the deck to the water.<br>  <br>  She had 4 Grand Staircases 3 in 1st class and 1 in 2nd class.<br>  <br>  Titanic made 2 stops before heading to New York 1st to Cherbourg, France, the then to Queenstown (known today as Cobh), Ireland.|`|jF6Sfgyyaa	wow that's awesome are you a writer?
b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	Depth of field means the distance in front and behind the subject that is in focus.  The aperture setting (F-stop) determines the depth of field.  When you focus on a subject, and use a wide aperture setting, you will have a very shallow depth of field.  Anything nearer or farther from the focal point will be blurry. So yes, I think the picture does show that you have an understanding of the concept.  I agree completely with Digital Dummy, and I think you will improve with practice.<br>  <br>  The 2nd picture is MUCH better and I think is a good demonstration of depth of field.  Nice job.<br>  <br>  By the way....Digital Dummy is no "dummy."  That dude also uses medium and large format film and does his own alternative processes.  I just had to say that :)<br>  <br>  MixedMojo...wow, I'm not sure what to tell you.  Bitter much?  Your answers are becoming very entertaining lately.  And the picture demonstrates depth of field and SELECTIVE FOCUS.  "Bokeh" is just a new, fad term for a very old photographic technique, which has been around for as long as there were cameras with an adjustable aperture.  (Way over 100 years).  It's selective focus, call it what it is.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	I would say no only because the small area that is in focus holds no interest. Had the focus been on that blue band (ribbon or whatever) I would say yes, but you are not demonstrating any control over the depth. It just appears random.<br>  <br>  Edited to add: I like the second shot, shows understanding and control!|`|65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	Absolutely!<br>  <br>  Just the fact that you have asked this question and were able to control the DOF to such a defined, small area shows that your are very cognizant of the concept.<br>  <br>  I suspect you were trying for the blue band but viewfinder, technical or other problems caused you to miss the exact mark. As an exercise and sample it is perfect.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	i would have focused on the foreground of the image and let the focus/depth fade out,<br>  <br>  if you like it great, looks like you got the idea, good one<br>  <br>  EDIT: the subject is letting you down a bit...... the 2nd image is ok, i still would focus on the foreground thats just me, the thumbs down business is a sad reflection on some of the people here!! Mo your ok dude!|`|YwdFUCQtaa	Image deleted.|`|WaJdOaFKaa	Not really - it shows you can produce an image with a very shallow depth of field - not necessarily that you understand the concept.  I read your other question and couldn't think of how to provide an answer that would be anything more than look up DoF on wikipedia.  There is no context to your questions, demonstrating you understand the concept of depth of field would be relatively simple. Take two images, one using a large aperture setting like f/2.8 or f/4, depending on the speed of the lens you are using; then another using a small aperture setting like f/16 or f/22; then put the two images together side by side noticing how much more of one image is in focus than the other, then explain the difference - or how focal length and distance from subject to be focused can effect the image as well.  The difference is field of focus, which is another way to term depth of field.  Light moving in any direction other than perpendicular to the plane of focus will not be in focus with light that is.  That's the textbook definition.  If you can explain how depth of field effects the image you posted, then yes, I'd say you understand the concept.<br>  <br>  Okay - so I see common sense eludes the masses.  Whatever.  Thanks, for the thumbs down ratings - just shows I'm right and someone disagrees.  Someone takes a blurred up photo and thinks they know what depth of field is - the question is about the demonstration of depth of field, not bokeh.  So haters can just bite me.<br>  <br>  Gateway:  How is that not what I wrote?  You don't need to paraphrase an answer before yours.  We know what bokeh is.  But did you know the word is Japanese for blurred?  Hehe.....|`|MlxxqLMYaa	The photograph certainly shows a shallow depth of field, but the "plane in focus" shows nothing of interest, and as such, probably suggests that you are unable to control the depth of field and the focus.<br>  <br>  I'd be tempted to re-shoot using the blue band as a focal point as already suggested. You are likely to get a better mark with the previously suggested shot.<br>  <br>  [Edit] Now you've retaken the shot... It's much better.|`|R3UVYaHtaa	yes if you focus on the blue band will be great...  this what they call LEADING LINES ... the leading lines rule can be used to direct the eye deeper into a photo and commonly to the main subject. Leading lines can lure the eye to a subject by leading to it from any side or depth of the photo. Leading lines could be roads, rivers, tree branches or even bridges. so if your blue band is in focus it will be tremendous.....<br>   good luck|`|i5OVORXgaa	yes... nice job!

QYPrM3GPaa	I will answer it...and I gave you a star because this is a very interesting observation (and question).<br>  <br>  There are probably a number of reasons.<br>  <br>  First, a question that asks you "how to" demands that you THINK.  Obviously, meaningless chit-chat does not require you to actually ask your brain cells to function.<br>  <br>  People have limited time, considering that their time is more important than your time - and they figure, that if you want to know HOW to do something, you should be taking YOUR time to do that - not them.  I know more CEO's who demand complex business problems to be reduced down onto a one page, 10 sentence statement than you would ever imagine - simply, because they think they are so important, they do not have to have to study all the details just to give you a yes or no answer.  They want YOU to do the work for them (that is why you are hired).  So any time you ask people HOW to do something, you are asking them to spend THEIR precious time to assist you.  Be grateful you get 5 answers that mean something rather than 50 that mean nothing.<br>  <br>  Third, most people, I think, don't come here to help anyone else, they come here to GET help.  So that means, they are more interested in finding someone to help them than they are in helping others...they, like you, are waiting for answers.<br>  <br>  Depending on the kind of problem, there may be no immediate answer out here for it - maybe you have asked rare questions and nobody has an answer - maybe this is not the right forum to answer that kind of question - maybe your questions are poorly written.<br>  <br>  People want it short, quick and brief - so if you have written it long, detailed and takes forever, they give up!  Too much detail.  Data overflow!  Blink Blink!  Red lights come on...too much data, cannot process!  Mind shuts off.  Make your questions, simple, to the point and with JUST the amount of detail required to get the point across and maybe more people will answer it.  Too little detail is as bad as too much.<br>  <br>  There, I think those were fair answers which I did, in fact, ask my brain cells to generate :)|`|1lLGYQ6Waa	Its pretty much like the guy above me said, Its because they don't want to take the time to explain and type a good Improving comment. But more to the answer is that because they all experience and have knowledge on the subject, and in the case of your e.g. question they do not, for instance I wouldn't even answer a question i wouldn't know (unless i was bored and felt like being a smart ***) which doesn't happen often.<br>  <br>  You should be happy atleast someone answers your question, I'm a guy who would prefer Quality over Quantity. Better there be less good ones then Alot of bad ones. Have a great life :{D>|`|spYpsixUaa	Sorry I'm late.  Has anybody got the Attendance Sheet so I can sign in?<br>  <br>  "The answer is Populism, ma'am.  People want to be part of the voice of their culture, not the voice of their products.  Coke or Pepsi is a cultural statement, not a description of preference.  It's like Reality TV or a trainwreck.  Nobody likes what they see but none of us can stop watching."|`|Om7OhWRUaa	Well, because it doesn't require any special expertise to give an opinion about something so common as soft drink preference, and because people are amused by arguing over things that they can all share.<br>  <br>  I don't think people are purposefully denying you useful information - they probably just don't know.|`|tKFO3u60aa	well, i would answer questions like "How do I change the battery in my new, hi-def television remote?" because the answer also seems absurdly simple. Scratch around on the back until you find a flip that pops off, take out the old batteries and put in the new ones, matching + to + and - to -. <br>  Then again, maybe I just wouldn't answer because I'd be afraid of being wrong.<br>  I wouldn't answer because if you are rich enough to afford a new, hi-def TV in this recession, then you should be smart enough to figure out a simple thing like changing batteries.<br>  <br>  I get what you mean, though. Sometimes I just don't feel experienced enough to give my advice on how to eradicate termites (umm...call the guys in the truck to come spray your house?) and I have been reported more than once for a rather facetious answer. E.g. "What type of arrows should I use for deer hunting?" "The best type of arrow is no arrow." Reported! <br>  Sorry, I'm getting sidetracked. I'm too likely to either not know the correct answer or dislike the question so much that I end up putting something silly. Then, I get reported, and I lose points. Plus, I really haven't helped anybody. Maybe the guy would have said, "Hmm..maybe I shouldn't go hunting after all" but what are the chances of that?<br>  <br>  I guess I like philosophy because you don't have to have any direct personal experience. Everything is related to something else here, and I feel like I actually help people in Psychology, people who desperately need some friendly help. <br>  <br>  I answer the poll questions when I'm bored. I don't go looking for "How to connect my TV receiver to the satellite". <br>  <br>  sorry this is so long.|`|J58okEzraa	People won't be bothered.<br>  It takes me 5 seconds at most to type in "coke", whereas providing a useful answer to your question will cost me a precious 5 whole minutes of my life that I could have used much more productively by staring off into space contemplating the pimple on my chin. I'm guilty of this just as much as the people of whom I speak, and I'm sure you'll agree. However, if you look in the right places, help can be found.|`|hwRZ7DY7aa	because their goal is not to help you but to gain the 2 points. Some people see it as a competition and try to get "rewarded". Giving a simple answer like "coke" saves them time to go and answer more such questions and gain more points. <br>  Although this is the majority there are also many people who honestly want to help and have the experience and background to do so, I have found some very useful inspiring answers on this site that make it worth my time browsing through what most of it is junk.<br>  (Hey you got more than 5 answers!)|`|AA10507866	Trivial opinion based questions are much more broad than specific technology based problems.

'coke or pepsi' makes people feel as though someone actually cares about their trivial taste preferences, whereas actually helping someone and demonstrating knowledge takes too much time with to little benefit (to their minds).|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	The persons who are not intellectually confident and just want to join in the fun, go for the simple questions.<br>  <br>  There are a lot more of them than us.|`|Yf3IgvYBaa	Funny thing is, after seeing this question I made a question asking "pepsi or coke".<br>  <br>  So far only 6 people have responded.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai38odHr9T5YqsePIfuqG47sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309200807AA7mkN4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  But I'm going to have to agree, most people don't post solid answers due to laziness. But you also have to factor in: everyone is an expert in their opinion, very few people are experts in high definition television remote batteries, and sometimes a question might be too vague.<br>  <br>  A classic example of this I saw today. Someone asked "How do I make my DSL wireless" and in additional details they wrote "I have a dsl modem and it goes into this switcher with an antenna thingie and I want to know how I can make it wifi". Obviously the make and model of the router is crucial to answering that competently (or at least the manufacture of the router).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|ltDPK4UFaa	Good question.  I think its' generally because people are pretty lazy.  They want to feel like they're helping someone, but they don't actually want to help them.

lPxVt2XYaa	The Great Purge was directed against the Communist Party.  It's goal was to remove a lot of people who had been identified as "careerist" or "enemies of the people".  Stalin wanted to purge those people who he felt were insufficiently loyal to him and those who had joined not for ideological reasons, but to further their careers and to ensure that they could shop in the party shops & sent their children to the best schools.<br>  <br>  The purges created such an atmosphere of paranoia that people did not dare to organise against the party.  As such there is very little information about how people were against them, other than personal testimony and diaries and letters.  <br>  <br>  Having said that, people were against them for several reasons:<br>  The purge, although directed at the party, also saw many ordinary Soviet citizens arrested for "wrecking" - this could mean the deliberate breaking of machinery, but, in most cases, the machines were accidentally broken by inexperienced workers who had been poorly trained, wrecking also covered being late for work too often.  So the state was arresting the very people the state was created for - the workers.<br>  <br>  They could also be arrested for "anti-Soviet Activity", this covered everything from plotting the downfall of the USSR to speaking about the leadership in a bad way.  They could also not criticise government policy, on any matter - so there was no freedom of speech.<br>  <br>  Also there were a lot of arbitrary arrests - for seemingly no reason people could find themselves in the hands of the NKVD (the secret police).  One reason for this was that the local NKVD offices, and the local Soviet were given targets - numbers of people to arrest.  This meant that if the "legitimate" number of arrests was not met, then they would, and could arrest anyone.  So the rule of law was suspended.<br>  Also because the purge turned on those who had committed it, the NKVD and the local party organisations and soviets, no-one was safe<br>  See:<br>  <a href="http://www.brama.com/ukraine/history/terror/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.brama.com/ukraine/history/ter...</a><br>  <br>  BTW, the estimates of the numbers of people arrested and killed during the Great Purge has decreased enormously since the opening of the archives in 1991.  Down from 60million death to 3 million.
gYMxno0Gaa	I LOVE TWILIGHT always have always will.....But I can see why people are getting sick of it. But I hate people who go out of their way to bagg out twilighters.....|`|4o3jaVHuaa	... And who is sick of the people bringing it up again by asking this kind of questions?<br>  <br>  This type of question is the reason why Twilight never dies on B&A.|`|GXnfJfU8aa	I like it (the first one at least: the other 3 annoy me since a certain somebody who I hate is in them).<br>  <br>  But I agree. All the little fan girls need to shut up.|`|PkA4hrKWaa	I really love it, but I'm sick of all these people thinking they are twi-hards, because they've read it once. ONCE. My friends made me read it six times before I was considered a twi-hard. Like I'll give you an example:<br>  <br>  I'm thirteen and in junior high. I'm in chorus. So we are getting new music that has a really pretty piano piece that sounds like water. I'm in the very back row because I'm taller than most people. I see this eighth grader (I'm in seventh) look behind her and tell a girl sitting next to me, "This is Bella's Lullaby!!!" And they start flipping out. I was like "...They wrote Bella's Lullaby. This song was out before Meyer was even born!"<br>  <br>  I was sooooooo mad. Not because they have their own opinion, but because everyone is taking it to a new level, when, in my opinion, they don't have the right to go there. I'll be fine with it when you read it a few more times and start going to the websites to get your facts straight. I am too annoyed to be listening to your crap and watch you make mad fools of yourself, all because you've read a book ONCE.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I'm done with my rant. Sorry about that, but I had to get that off my chest.|`|ENQkQ6JKaa	i liked it when it first came out and no one knew about it ., then that dumb movie came out and well it was like ed this bella that<br>  blah blah blah<br>  *SHOOTS SELF IN HEAD* <br>  im going insane , a girl in my school's dad owns a barnes and noble and gor 400 free copies of it and gave them out free at my school <br>  EVRYONE READ IT . . .<br>  agh..|`|Om7OhWRUaa	I am sick of it, but I trust that it will go away sooner or later.|`|gbfHisNnaa	i love it|`|ZQOMEH95aa	I am most definiteley sick of it. <br>  I mean, what's so great about it? In every single book, Bella is going to die, Edward is going to die, or all of the Cullens are going to die. There's no excitement.<br>  And, how can people be psycho over Twilight when there's badasses like Anne Rice out there? She REALLY knows how to write vampires, I must admit. There is NO comparison between Anne Rice and Stephenie Meyer. None at all. <br>  Seriously, all you silly Twilight fans, get over Edward Freakin Cullen and check out the Vampire Chronicles. Team Edward SUCKS! TEAM LESTAT!|`|5YAe0Vffaa	I do love Twilight but I am sick of everyone making such a big deal about it.  I liked it better before everyone else started reading it and going crazy|`|JtxT2qZbaa	I definitely don't care.

Nothing is more annoying than that!  If you've read the book 48329084320 times then good for you.  You read the same story as the person who has only read it once.  It doesn't make you any better of a person.  "LiKe OhhhH Mii GaWd, mII fRieNdS MaDe Me REad tHe BoOk 8493289023093485920 tImEs bEfoRE tHeY bElieVed tHat I rEALLY LovEd EdWarD!!!!1!"  Who cares!  haha<br>  <br>  I love the series, and the hype will eventually die down.  And if other people want to read it and talk about it then good for them!  I'm glad we share an interest in something!|`|ot8tF158aa	I have heard enough of Twilight. First everyone started talking about it and I wanted to see it but now that everyone is talking about it I don't even want to hear the word Twilight.|`|3EoJMD6kaa	I used to love Twilight. It was my favorite book of all time! but then i read all these other vamp series and suddenly, Edward seemed a lot less hot. So, yeah, I guess i am sick of it.|`|GHUmdWIOaa	i love it but people are always talking about how cute Edward is or that Jacob looks better with short hair it gets really annoying they think (people in my class) they are so popular just because they read the first book...whatever|`|GGsQ6KuMaa	LOVE IT
70fvxvj0aa	It's Stephenie Meyer's Mormon fantasy where she inserts herself into the protagonist's role in the most ham-fisted fashion imaginable. It's a story about a beautiful girl who thinks she's ugly, who is loved by everyone in the school and thinks she's unpopular, but with the lovable quirk of her adorable clumsiness. She has no faults and is pure as the driven snow. So when a vampire comes to her and says that she's special, she falls madly in love with him. But these aren't your normal vampires. They're also pure and good and sweet, because they feed off mountain lions.<br>  <br>  And when they go out into the sun, they glitter like marble statues polished with rainbows.<br>  <br>  It's truly an incredible story, right up there with the best of Faulkner.<br>  <br>  Pretty much everything Edward does is extremely creepy when done in any sort of real life situation, and pretty much everything Bella does in response is the exact opposite of what she should do.<br>  <br>  I mean, really, who gets stopped mid argument by their significant other's beautiful eyes? No one, that's who. The books paint an extremely unrealistic picture of romance and what a woman should expect in a partner, and, quite frankly, it's sickening to me that so many little girls are reading this and thinking it's what love is really like. <br>  <br>  Stephenie Meyer isn't an author. She doesn't understand what an author is or what an author's purpose is. She's a writer who tells cliche, vastly underdeveloped, silly love stories that imitate her own romantic fantasies. She capitalizes off of hormonal teenage girls.|`|zy5qcc0Raa	I LOVE THEM! i completely understand what your saying about her character, but she has so many other positive qualities that get overlooked. Also, it fits in with the overall theme and point of the book. I think they're amazing!|`|VmLZFN4Taa	I liked the books all in all, but Bella definitely did get annoying.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	I absolutely love them. I'm not a teenager either.  I'm a married mother of 2 who reads just about everything I can get my hands on.  I didn't like the 4th one so much, but I did like the others, Twilight is by far my favorite.  I don't have much of a life outside of my family either.  This includes my husband and children.  My brother is the same.  He even rearranges his schedule for his wife regardless of what it is.|`|8DwxwhStaa	I think they read like a soap opera (sans the sex).  Dark Shadows anyone?  Not good or bad, just compelling in that sort of superficial way.|`|Q49d8oD1aa	I personally hate the series....|`|Om7OhWRUaa	I don't like them personally, but I think they're fine for what they are - popular YA fiction. They sure as hell shouldn't be turned to for feminine role models.|`|KDd3tMvaaa	Yes I do like these books but I agree with you about Bella. She can become terribly annoying. I think it is a twisted sort of romance but I think it works and I think the books are written really well. But then again I'm a huge romantic and have obsessed over these books so I guess I'm stuck in the middle between love and like when it comes to rating these books.<br>  <br>  (hope this made sense)|`|3wYb6bfiaa	I think their okay <br>  but i cant stand it when people act like their the best things in the world and talk about them 24/7 <br>  <br>  ITS CALLED HAVING NO LIFE <br>  <br>  lol unfortunaly i have no life either but at least i dont take it to the extemes like these Twilight Lovers|`|HJR5ZCpHaa	LOL. TRUE. I like and dislike them, I have MANY MANY reasons.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgN3dSAgMKEG9JVoHerjA8LAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309161450AAbpVyX">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|5dycdvZoaa	I tried to read Twilight in summer school (I wasn't failing anything, I was working ahead!) I got it from the girl next to me. She said she loved those sort of fantasy/romance things, and decided to pick it up. I asked her what she thought, and she refrained from telling me, "I'll let you decide first." It took me about an hour to get thought. I thought it was pretty unintelligent, and told her so. She agreed. For someone who likes that kind of thing, that's pretty harsh. <br>  The book, to me, seemed like pointless drivel. Like the sort of thing I used to image might happen to me with a cute guy when I was very young. The sort of thing I knew was impossible and ridiculous, and would never tell anyone about, because I knew how silly and inane it was. <br>  I guess what I'm trying to say is that the book is a lousy waste of paper, but at least people are reading.|`|Hby8UMRLaa	I wasn't really able to get that far due to the writing... so I guess I wouldn't be a great person to answer this question. My friends, though, really disliked the whole first book. They didn't really care to advance beyond that.<br>  <br>  My step mom on the other hand loved the books and liked the movie.|`|RrtUV5wcaa	its somewhere in the middle for me. i used to like them a lot more a few months ago, but after re reading in a few times, i started to notice A LOT of flaws that made me like it less and less. and there's also the fact that since the movie came out its become the new fad and now there's edward obsessed 10 year olds everywhere, which has really made it kind of annoying. <br>  <br>  so i still think it's ok, but i'm liking it less and less. i probably won't get to a point where i hate it, but i'm probably not going to be a fan anymore either. its a poorly written, cliché, bad example book about a stalker/vampire and a girl with really low self esteem that fall in love and have a kid, who get's imprinted on my the girl's best friend, and they all live happily ever after in the end.<br>  <br>  and i agree with you about bella and edward.|`|W2RrWsoEaa	I think that the Twilight series is a great set of books, although I do agree that Bella has a clingy and very shallow personality, however I do not agree with people who say that the characters are undeveloped, I believe that they are developed as much as they have to be and the rest is left open. Stephenie meyer said that she wanted her readers to be able to connect with her characters so she left a lot of things open to their imaginations. <br>  I will admit that Stephenie Meyer is not the best writer, but considering her background I think that she did an excellent job in bringing the story to life.|`|i0MQe6Fnaa	i find myself to be a mixture of love/hate. i like the way that edward is mysterious, loving, and very helpful, but i really do not like the way Bella is always so weak. i understand how stephanie meyer would want bella to be that way so edward could protect her and care for her, but i still don't like how her character is portrayed. If you are into vampired i would try the vampire academy books. if you are into Bella and Edwards compassionate love story, then try a book like from the romance section. sorry i cant think of any good romance novels i have read recently. if you are just into good teenage books read the Poison Apples. a very good book for teens. daring and fun. <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|AXkuxtzcaa	Personally, I liked them. <br>  Although, I COMPLETELY agree with you. Bella was a horrible main character; i absolutely hated her. She is always playing the martyr and its so annoying. I was also so frustrated how everyone drooled over her when there is nothing to her. She is not funny or intelligent, all she does is complain, and she is described as average. She also treated Jacob horribly, she used him when she got lonely. <br>  I dont know, guess the readers are attracted to that unrealistic, almost diluted idea of love and reality. I think they are entertaining, but i agree with you 110%|`|KEGijRVraa	Yeah I do agree with that, but I still like the series!<br>  I do find bella a bit sort of too dependant and the whole load of crap on her being "protected" and stuff makes her seem as if she really is vulnerable, which does annoy me. <br>  It does seem a very one way relationship, as Edward will give in to Bella with anything and Bella just gets her way the whole time and it can get boring at times but I'm sticking with it :)|`|gX05OncWaa	I liked the book when I first read it, but now, with all the screaming fangirls and no one shutting up about it, it's really starting to grate on my nerves.<br>  <br>  And I totally agree about Bella. She annoys me, and she's way to clingy. <br>  <br>  I haven't read past the first book, but apparently she doesn't want to marry Edward because she's scared of commitment? My English/Creative Writing teacher pointed this out: She won't marry him, but she's all to willing to become a vampire. That's a little more commitment, don't you think? XD|`|TestVDEcaa	I love twilight even though im kinda new to them im about halfway through new moon and i think its great<br>  <br>  <br>  i saw the film as well the other day and i think that the characters are portrayed just like in the books... i don't think i agree with you when you say bella is insufferable the point of the story is a conflict with bella trying to adjust to her normal human life after coming into contact with Edward<br>  <br>  <br>  Love The books (so far) loved the film cant wait to read the next one|`|PWH0nxJCaa	The book itself is pretty good, but im in the middle. Bella is so shallow and dependent. And basically everything you said. Oh, and the movie sucked. They twisted the plot. Horrible movie!!!!!!!|`|78TTQWP9aa	well i think you're right about Bella. <br>  but i still kinda like the books. Mostly because of Jacob.<br>  he was actually the most real character, despite him being a werewolf.|`|TNy8ME6Paa	I totally agree with you about Bella, but I do love the books. I mean they're very entertaining; always something new and unexpected.|`|VXTze2A5aa	to me, idk if he even loves her?? isnt he only dating her because of the way she smells!!?? and it does send out some bad messages.. but its a fictional drama.. so waht ever. i like the books though!!|`|0XqaN5csaa	wow, i never put it that way before. I guess your right though. But i still love the books, they are so interesting and fun to read.|`|q3a3qGlQaa	I must say that lol sup said everything that I wanted to say!<br>  <br>  I prefer books with plots that start in the beggining not 3/4 through.|`|VYuJfazQaa	TWILIGHT HATER ALERT!!!!!<br>  LOL! me personally loved the series and the movie!<br>  GO EDWARD MY ONE TRUE LOVE!!!!<br>  thought i think bella needs to die so i can be her!!!<br>  double lol!|`|3ZUE6cNFaa	It's a badly written, unoriginal novel that a lot of people like because they wish their life was like it|`|IVplROhGaa	I have three thoughts on the series (of which i read all four books)<br>  <br>  1. Honestly, they are poorly written. I'm pretty surprised she got the first one out there at all, there must be better pieces of literature that need publishing.<br>  2. I agree with you, I strongly disliked Bella. I found her whiny, overly dependent, and overall not the best role model for girls. Its like she's saying its cool to go for the creeper guys, plus I also hated the way she couldnt function normally without Edward around. What happened to strong, independent female protagonists?<br>  3. Despite all this, I enjoyed the books. I found myself reading them nonstop until I finished, because they were intriguing. <br>  <br>  If anyone hasnt read them and is only looking for a great romance, there are much better books out there. Try some classic Jane Austen (pride and prejudice is a personal fave- at least Elizabeth was a strong, interesting character)|`|KFvA7cJwaa	I think the twilight series were amazing! There the only books I actually liked reading. but i totally agree with you with the whole Bella being like kinda annoying sometimes because she was and sometimes you can't stand her but think about how many other books/movies/tv shows do that with one of the main characters there in love with a guy and so they complain even more. hah! but i loved the books!|`|kMGqvNJMaa	i personally LOVE the twilight series, and yes I completely understand your point about how at times she may seem weak and uncontrollable for Edward. However, I try to keep in mind that after all it is just a fantasy story about how this young girl falls in love head over heels for Edward and Bella never really had a father since her parents had divorced at a very young age it may be that she loves him as more than just any boy. Edward is like the one guy that she feels most connected to, even though at the same time they shouldn't be together in the first place.|`|qZMBp4EPaa	I used to love the Twilight series. It amazed me. I reread the books over and over again. I was obsessed. I went to the Breaking Dawn premier party and read it 8 hours straight, from 12:30 am to 8:30 am. Then the series became very popular. It was unoriginal and almost superficial to love twilight. Then the movie came out. It was terrible. i still love the books, but i feel ashamed to admit so.|`|VEHNAb2uaa	I do love the books. But you are right she is way to dependent on Edward. I mean really that's not such a good message to be sending to girls. "Oh yes you can not live with out this guy" nope. not a good message. but otherwise yeah im totally one of the obsessed freaks|`|6PMJ7ECpaa	ok dude/ dudette, i SO TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU!!! i think bella is too dependent and the romantice stuff - coming from edward- is wayyy too cheesey. i am an all out team jacob fan and well... yeah. people hate me for my twilight views but her, watcha gonna do bout it? lol <br>  <br>  i know everyone has their own point of view but hey, thats mine.|`|LZzIcbs7aa	I love the serious. and i LOVE edward.<br>  but i agree i dont like bella at all.<br>  <br>  i wish she had a different personality.<br>  but i still like twilight and edward lol.|`|RBJr5jwRaa	nerdy girls in my bus talk about it|`|6d4f246f09757222d71a5d62b8c2d0fcaa	Wow, two very persuasive arguments here. I have read all the twilight books except the last one (which i'm saving till semester is over), and really all I thought of them was an easy, entertaining read. Certainly the intelligence in the novels is very limited. While reading the books, I too found Bella extremely annoying, she wants Jacob, but seems to be in crazy unhealthy love with Edward. It's like jeez make your mind up, and stop being so selfish!! <br>  I don't hate it or love it. It's just easy entertainment for a fast reader, and when you don't tv either!  :(|`|pEIKVRcBaa	thats a really good question. Personally, i love and hate them, though for different reasons then what u said (but ur arguments are very legit) i like them because they are well written and they have a good solid plot. On the other hand though, i don't like them because i always get really depressed after i read them. As in, for 1-2 weeks after i'm really depressed that no guy i ever meet will ever be that perfect as edward is. <br>           I think that the biggest problem with the series is that it gives an unrealist picture to girls of all ages of the perfect relationship and the perfect guy, when in reality there is no such thing. All humans are flawed and can't be perfect. thats my opinion.
zkPIInMmaa	Two things that will work. Guaranteed. 1. Learn your script so thoroughly that, if you had to, you could say it in your sleep. 2. Practice your audition part over and over and over and over again. When you're so sick of doing it that you can't do it any more, do it again. You'll be confident enough to CHANNEL that nervous energy into a vibrant performance. The energy will just surge out of you in the acting, no matter what the part. Guaranteed.|`|QRtFW4GWaa	Dress well (I've always been told to wear what I'd wear meeting a new date's parents)<br>  Stay calm and don't freak out, especially during the audition<br>  If you need a monologue, learn it like the back of your hand<br>  If you're reading from a script they give you, look up more often than you look down.  I suggest reading a line or two and memorizing it quick and saying it while facing up, and then reading the next line or two to yourself.  They understand that people can't memorize the script in 20 seconds, but you look *much better* going a little slower and actually acting than you do reading at a normal speed.|`|A2jA9dd1aa	look and feel confident(: stand up straight. speak loud enough for them to hear you. act like they are your freiends(: if they say something harsh just remember it's for the better. wear professional clothes not professional but NOT casual. make your hair look nice and if you are wearing make-up, go for the natural look. also if you have chipped off nail polish on your hands / feet take it off or re-do your nails :D i hope this helps<3

NYU37jfGaa	The death rate was high.  In 'America's Women' Gail Collins writes:<br>  <br>  'The Chesapeake wsa a death trap.  The brackish water, mosquito-laden swamps, and steamy weather killed most people during their first year.  Those who survived often suffered from weakness or periodic fits as an aftermath of their exposure to malaria.  At least 6,000 people came to Virginia between 1607 and 1624, by 1625, only 1,200 survivors were still there.  But the colonies' sponsors were desperate to get females, by hook or by crook - their ventures were in danger of being wrecked on the shoals of dissolute, irresponsible young manhood.  In 1619, the Virginia House of Burgesses, petitiioning that wives as well as husbands be eligible for grants of free land, argued that in a new plantation "it is not knowen whether man or woman be the most necessary."  London recruiters began searching for marriageable women, offering free passage and trousseaus for girls of good reputation and with a sense of adventure.  When they married, their husbands had to reimburse the company with 120 pounds of good leaf tobacco.  The first shipment of 'tobacco brides' arrived in Jamestown in the spring of 1620.  Allice Burges, at twenty-eight wsa one of the oldest and said to be skillful in the art of brewing beer - important in a place where the water was generally undrinkable.<br>  <br>  Almost everyone lived on a farm - the whole point of the colonial dream was to get your own land and grow a profitable cash crop like tobacco.  Th eenglish believed that fieldwork was a man's task, but the colonies were desperately short on labor, and young planters expected their wives to labor alongside them in the fields.  The farms were almost all isolated, surrounded by endless forests, down winding waterways without any real roads to connect them. Plantation owners were forced to be away from home for long periods of time on business, and the often depended on their wives, or even daughters, to drain swamps, tend cattle, cultivate the tobacco, and otherwise amange things while they were gone.<br>  <br>  It was virtually impossible to get a divorce, but thanks to the malarial swamps, few peopel wound up married for life.  The average union ended with the death of one partner within seven years.  During the first half of the seventeenth century, the mortality rate in the Chesapeake was about 80 percent.  It created patchwork families made up of widows, widowers, and several degrees of stepchildren.  Men who made it through their first year in the Chesakpeake could claim the title of 'seasoned', but their life expectancy was still only about forty-five years.  women's life expectancy was even lower, but since they married so young - almost as soon as they hit puberty - they often outlived their husbands.  The colonies were crowded with widows, many of them managing large estates.<br>  <br>  Mary Johnson may have been the first African American woman.  She arrived sometime before 1620 as the maid of a Virginia planter. Johnson and her husband were indentured servants, and once they earned their freedom, they acquired a 250-acre farm and five indentured servants of their own.  by the mid-seventeenth century, a free black population had begun to emerge in both the North and the south.  <br>  <br>  In charleston, South Carolina, black women took over the local market, selling vegetables, chickens, and other produce they acquired from the growing population of slaves, who generally had small plots beside their cabins.  The city came to depend on the women for its supply of fresh food,a nd whites complained long and loud about the power and independence of the trading women.  In 1686, South Carolina passed a law prohibiting the purchas eof goods from slaves, but it had little effect.  A half century later, Charleston officials were still complaining about the "exorbitant price" that black women charged for "many articles necessary for the support of the inhabitants."<br>  <br>  Southern hospitality was to a large extent the creation of a desperately lonely people.  George Washington used to post a slave at the crossroads near his plantation to invite any passerby to dinner.  "Strangers are sought after with greediness" wrote an observer.  A circuit judge in North Carolina in the REvolutionary War stopped at the home of some well-to-do newlyweds who were living on the husband's farm, eighteen miles form the nearest neighbor.  He wrote that when a male visitor told the young bride he would bring his own wife to visit her, she wept with gratitude.  But a good hostess had no control over when the blessing of company would arrive, or for how long.  Friends, familiy, and unknwon passerby felt free to drop in by the wagonload without notice, and they expected to be fed and lodged when they arrived.  Neighbors who came together for balls, weddings or even dancing lessons often stayed for several days.
jRWYVZ5vaa	Trends means the direction that the history took. With respect to Indians, they started out being the only people living in North America. Once the Europeans came, they gradually and violently stole the land away from the native Americans, and deprived them of their freedom by forcing them to leave their homes and live on small reservations.
Th3bifTWaa	Well.. you do it the way the actors and actresses in the  movie do it, obviously. <br>  <br>  Here's a suggestion:<br>  <br>  Go on youtube and search "Jai Ho". Find the clip from the movie and watch the video 3 or 4 times. Study the dance movements, and try doing them while watching the video. Don't rush though; it doesn't matter if you don't do it properly right now.<br>  <br>  Next, break the song down into.. say.. 20 seconds. Learn the dance movements from the first 20 seconds. Keep doing it until you get it right. Then move onto the next 20 seconds and do the same thing. Do that until you get to the end of the song, then put it all together and watch yourself in the mirror. <br>  <br>  Oh, and make sure you get a partner cause this isn't really a solo dance, I think .<br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  <3

P0VkRUPlaa	you basically have to keep working to strength your ankles. You can do this by practicing relevés, using an elastic band with ankle excersices, and any other ones that your ballet teacher can think of. As for what shoes, I think its more about your ankle strength, but go to a dance store and have a professional pick help you pick out the right shoes for you.|`|6RrmmDyLaa	If you are talking about rolling in your feet while in a give position, then you just need to pull-up the muscles in your thigh and quads.<br>  Good luck! ?
eJGjpTJ9aa	stretch every day.<br>  to help get splits down. be sure you dont hold your breath. you need to breathe. when your in your splits tighten up all your muscles and then relax. and you will go farther down. also oversplits. get a thick book or two and do splits off them. as you become more flexible add a book. this may hurt and you will be sore. but remember no pain no gain! hope this helps :)|`|Ec2uIBjxaa	Middle splits!<br>  <br>  begin by sitting in a straddle stretch on a mat or like somethin soft, When stretching the middle splits during warm-up, go slowly. Even if you are very<br>  flexible, your muscles need time to adjust.<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Lean towards each leg and towards the middle, just as you would for a plain "V" sit. Gradually work your legs wider, stretching your torso to each leg as you increase the straddle<br>  .<br>  Step3<br>  Roll your hips forward when your legs are fully split, moving your body into vertical alignment. The correct position is with toes pointed and your knees forward. The inside of your feet should lie flat on the mat. This is also the position you will use on the beam, allowing your toes to grab the edge.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Straighten your back. Although some arch is necessary due to your hip alignment, an over-arched back will receive a penalty in gymnastic competition. Lift your torso tall and tuck in your stomach.<br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Allow a gymnastic teammate to lift one of your legs carefully when you're in a full middle split. This helps you stretch into an over-split, which is necessary when performing your splits during a jump.<br>  <br>  Tips:::::::xx<br>  <br>  * Try stretching more often but not applying so much pressure that you're sore the next day. Instead of stretching once a day and forcing the split, stretch 3 times a day and use less pressure. Allow your muscles to warm up each time by proceeding slowly.<br>  <br>  <br>  * Relax into your splits. When doing the splits is uncomfortable, just sit there and breathe deeply for a few minutes. Your muscles will eventually relax, allowing your legs to stretch further.<br>  <br>  <br>  * Don't just drop down into the middle splits without a warm-up first. You could pull a muscle.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Left and Right splits:<br>  Spend 10-15 minutes every morning before school doing all your streches<br>  Spend 10-15 minutes every night doing all your stretches<br>  Point your toes at all times it helps!<br>  Maybe even get some one to slightly push you down..i mean really carefully ,you don't want any broken bones here<br>  <br>  <br>  If you dont know what streches to do heres a link that will help you<br>  <a href="http://www.runtheplanet.com/trainingraci..." rel="nofollow">http://www.runtheplanet.com/trainingraci...</a><br>  this is a really good stretchh as well <a href="http://z.about.com/d/running/1/5/G/-/-/-..." rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/running/1/5/G/-/-/-...</a><br>  make sure you practice every day and night it really makes a difference dont say ohh nahh i couldnt be botherd today im so tired ill practice tomorrow<br>  practice all the time okay,beleive in yourself dont think negative<br>  <br>  -you can even search on youtube for some extra tips<br>  <br>  You can also stretch after you have had a warm bath/shower<br>  Make sure you dont start stretching straight away you have to warm up first maybe 5 minutes jumping with a jump rope<br>  or 5 minutes running around in the back/front yard<br>  I'm a gymnast i know what i'm talking about<br>  if you really try your hardest and push further and further each time you will be able to do all 3 splits in approx 2 weeks or even less,<br>  <br>  <br>  think positive YOU CAN DO IT<br>  good luck hope i helped|`|tbbWp18taa	<a href="http://www.cmcrossroads.com/bradapp/docs/rec/stretching/stretching_7.html#SEC76" rel="nofollow">http://www.cmcrossroads.com/bradapp/docs...</a><br>  <br>  Great techniques..<br>  check them out|`|6RrmmDyLaa	Have someone push your legs down while your legs are on a wall, back to the ground.  <br>  Also use the 'frog position' (look-up on internet) and stay for as long as your body allows.<br>  <br>  I have all splits and I use the techniques often, good luck!! ?|`|XVImJhplaa	ok go as far down as you can and then hold that for 10 seconds each way and in a few weeks you will be able to go all the way down all 3 ways. it helped my daughter

During the time before they entered, they were sending suplies via ships to both the axis and allied powers, though 75 percent was going to the allies side. The US actualy entered because of the Zimmerman Note. It was a transmission intercepted by the US from Germany to Mexico, stating that if Mexico helped the axis powers, that they would defeat america, and mexico would get to keep all the land that the US was on. So it was really a defensive war as far as reasons for entering go. One thing that was accomplished was the Leauge of Nations (which the nation refused to join). This leauge made it against the rules to go to war. <br>  <br>  My opinion, didnt really solve any issuses except for keep Mexico at bay :-)<br>  <br>  help any??|`|0a98orZNaa	Are you asking how the US got into WWI?

BBfIXcI0aa	Well, assuming it's the revival version, you have:<br>  Male characters: Charlie Brown, Linus, Schroeder<br>  Female characters: Lucy, Sally<br>  And Snoopy can be played by either gender, as it's a dog.<br>  <br>  All of the roles have their strengths and weaknesses, and with the exception of Charlie Brown, which is a touch larger, they're all fairly equal in size. You can YouTube the show. Snoopy is very high-energy, and more dance-oriented in most shows. Charlie is the main character, obviously, and does a lot of "poor me". He's a tenor, and was played by Anthony Rapp once, if that tells you anything. Linus follows Lucy around and has a love song with his blanket, and Schroeder has some really fun numbers. Lucy and Sally are both feisty, though Lucy is obviously much more extreme.|`|AA12272993	If you are looking for the song people will walk out of the show thinking about...

kiD47XbTaa	There are many monologues posted all over the internet, but honestly, I wouldn't suggest them unless you know a lot about acting - given circumstances, motivation etc.<br>  But, do you have a favourite play? Maybe you could find a monologue in it. <br>  Or maybe you could create one....that would be interesting. <br>  But anyways, do you know 'The Diary of Anne Frank'? There are amazing monologues in there! Plus, it's a brilliant story and sad too! <br>  Here's one I found:<br>  <br>  “…(writing in diary)The air raids are getting worse. They come over day and night. The noise is terrifying. Pim says it should be music to our ears. The more planes, the sooner will come the end of the war. Mrs. Van Daan pretends to be a fatalist. What will be will be. But when the planes come over, who is the most frightened? No one else but Petronella!…Monday, the ninth of November, nineteen forty-two. Wonderful news. Allies have landed in Africa. Pim says we can look for an early finish to the war. Just for fun he asked each of us what was the first thing we wanted to do when we got out of here. Mrs. Van Daan longs to be home with her own things, her needlepoint chairs, the Beckstein piano her father gave her…the best money could buy. Peter would like to go to a movie. Mr. Dussel wants to get back to his dentist’s drill. He’s afraid he is losing his touch. For myself, there are so many things…to ride a bike again…to laugh till my belly aches…to have new clothes from the skin out…to have a hot tub filled to overflowing and wallow in it for hours…to be back in school with my friends.”<br>  <br>  And here's another from 'Peter Pan' from the POV of Anne. <br>  <br>  ANNE<br>  Look, Peter, the sky. (She looks up through the skylight) What a lovely, lovely day! Aren’t the clouds beautiful? You know what I do when it seems as if I couldn’t stand being cooped up for one minute? I think myself out. I think myself out. I think myself on a walk in the park where I used to go with Pim. Where the jounquils and the crocus and the violets grow down the slopes. You know the most wonderful part about thinking yourself out? You can have it any way you like. You can have roses and violets and chrysanthemums all blooming at the same time . . . it’s funny . . . I used to take it all for granted . . . and now I’ve gone crazy about everything to do with nature. Haven’t you? (softly) I wish you had a religion, Peter. Oh, I don’t mean you have to be Orthodox . . . or believe in heaven and hell and purgatory and things . . . I just mean some religion . . . it doesn’t matter what. Just to believe I something! When I think of all that’s out there . . . the trees . . . and flowers . . . and seagulls . . . when I think of the dearness of you, Peter . . . and the goodness of the people we know . . . Mr. Kraler, Miep, Dirk, the vegetable man, all risking their lives for us every day . . . When I think of these good things, I’m not afraid anymore . . . I find myself, and God, and I . . . We’re not the only person that’ve had to suffer. There’ve always been people that’ve had to . . . sometimes one race . . . sometimes another . . . and yet . . . (going to him) I know it’s terrible, trying to have any faith . . . when people are doing such horrible . . . But you know what I sometimes think? I think the world may be going through a phase, the way I was with Mother. It’ll pass, maybe not for hundreds of years, but some day . . . I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart. But, Peter, if you’d only look at it as a part of a great pattern . . . that we’re just a little minute in the life . . . (She breaks off) Listen to us, going at each other like a couple of stupid grownups! Look at the sky now. Isn’t it lovely? (She holds her hand out to him. PETER takes it and rises, standing with her at the window looking out, his arms around her.) Someday, when we’re outside again, I’m going to . . <br>  <br>  I hope I've helped!|`|jqyTUuPHaa	There is a really good one in Romeo & Juliet.

AA10015648	If you're in front of the camera, there are chemicals you can buy at costume stores that make you cry. You can also have some fresh onions standing by. I'm totally not kidding, lol! I had to do a photo-shoot in college and in-between photos, I'd cut the onion and sniff it in, and my eyes were watering out of control! It wasn't hard to act sad, with the tears coming already!<br>  <br>  If you're on stage, you don't have to worry about tears NEARLY so much. A single tear on camera may look awesome and deep and emotional, but nobody will notice a single tear if they're more than 5 rows back from the stage. The biggest thing is to act like you have tears... wipe them away, then wipe your hand on a sleeve, as if it was wet. Our drama director always told us to act like we were laughing, just without smiling. It works wonders!<br>  <br>  If you're REALLY into it, then practice! Remember the last thing that made you cry and FEEL it, and let it come out. Don't let yourself blink, because the dry air will help your eyes tear up. Then go for it!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|hUYaaXBvaa	think of something sad, or try to think seriously about your character, if they have a reason to cry concentrate on why they would be sad.<br>  keep your eyes open for as long as they can, they'll feel irritated<br>  use eyedrops, water<br>  im no  prfessional though, ive just done videos with friends for class.|`|kiD47XbTaa	When you're playing a character, and lets just say, your character's dog has just died and they are extremely upset. You have to develop in to that character so much, that this fictional event makes you cry naturally because you ARE this character. <br>  But if you don't exactly know how it would feel for your pet dog to die because you've never owned one, think of another sad event in your life, maybe somebody close to you has died or there's a sad song about life and death which makes you sad, whilst playing your character relate the dog's death to a sad event in your life and you will be able to relate to that character better which will mean that you will naturally cry, and it isn't forced. <br>  This is the only way to be able to cry. <br>  Something that really helps me is, before I do a sad scene, I listen to some sad music which helps me get into my character and when I get on stage/screen I already have that sadness built inside of me ready to be let out. <br>  <br>  I hope I've helped!<br>  Break a leg!|`|Dev04Gw1aa	For some reason, looking up a lot can help. Make yourself tense, and stare into the lights. If you have to do it on stage, prepare BEFORE you do on. Take deep, panicked breaths, and try to think of sad things. If you have a hard time getting the tears started, yawn a lot until your eyes tear a little, then take deep breaths, look up into lights, and hold your breath. Good luck, this is a hard technique when you need it!|`|D8sN8gNFaa	Think of the loss of a loved one, think of the worst day of your life, pretend that you are letting out a big secret off your chest...etc|`|BkKth2y8aa	pull out a nose hair|`|EyAAFfaMaa	BECOME THE CHARACTER!<br>  <br>  If it isn't for acting, then just think of something sad.

FWxcQ8Kxaa	Igtheism is not a term that embraces atheism. Atheism is a belief that there is no god, a + theism i.e. ‘no-god’. To assert that, you would need to have some concept of the thing it is the existence of which you are denying. The term igtheism is ig + theism i.e. ignorance of what the term ‘god’ means; even a denial that it means anything at all. So an igtheist is not denying that god exists, they are denying that the term ‘god’ actually refers to anything meaningful at all. In that case it would necessarily be quite impossible to deny that it exists, just as it would be impossible to assert that it does.  A possible response to the igtheist’s position would be to explain what the term ‘god’ does mean. Since so far nobody seems to have been able to do that except in the vaguest and most vacuous terms, e.g. a ‘something up there’ or ‘the uncaused cause of it all’, igtheism would seem to be a reasonable stance. But it is very different from atheism.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	In this definition from Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignosticism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignosticism</a> the first case would be considered "hard" atheism; the second case would be "soft" atheism.<br>  <br>  As this site <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/atheist4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/atheis...</a> makes clear, there is conflict over the terminology of what an atheist is.<br>  <br>  This respected site lists 23 explanations of atheism. <a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/definitionofatheism/Definition_of_Atheism_Dictionaries_Atheists_Others_Define_Atheism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://atheism.about.com/od/definitionof...</a>

iNXqiDIYaa	there are two beatrices in the stories both Baudelaires by marriage - see this extract<br>  <br>  The book consists of thirteen letters, six from Beatrice Baudelaire to Lemony Snicket, six from Lemony Snicket to Mrs. Beatrice Baudelaire, and one from Lemony Snicket to his editor (one of these appears in every book in the main series, but this is the first time such a letter has been incorporated into the plot). However, the two Beatrices, despite sharing a name, are clearly separate individuals, and while Lemony Snicket's letters are plainly written beginning from his childhood and ending shortly before Violet Baudelaire is born, the Beatrice writing to Snicket is apparently writing after the events of The End. The older Beatrice is the one referred to throughout A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket as his deceased love, and her identity as the mother of the Baudelaire children from the series is revealed in The Beatrice Letters, but the younger Beatrice's identity is not directly explained, apart from the statement that she also has some connection to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny (although in The End it is revealed that she is the daughter of Kit Snicket).<br>  <br>  from this article<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatrice_Letters" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatric...</a>

1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	Your last book is "Gods Behaving Badly" by Marie Phillips<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Behaving-Badly-Marie-Phillips/dp/0316067628/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236646014&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Behaving-Badl...</a><br>  "British blogger Phillips's delightful debut finds the Greek gods and goddesses living in a tumbledown house in modern-day London and facing a very serious problem: their powers are waning, and immortality does not seem guaranteed. In between looking for work and keeping house, the ancient family is still up to its oldest pursuit: crossing and double-crossing each other. Apollo, who has been cosmically bored for centuries, has been appearing as a television psychic in a bid for stardom. His aunt Aphrodite, a phone-sex worker, sabotages him by having her son Eros shoot him with an arrow of love, making him fall for a very ordinary mortal-a cleaning woman named Alice, who happens to be in love with Neil, another nice, retiring mortal. When Artemis-the goddess of the moon, chastity and the hunt, who has been working as a dog walker-hires Alice to tidy up, the household is set to combust, and the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Fanciful, humorous and charming, this satire is as sweet as nectar."|`|yvyewZrWaa	The first one may be "The Forestwife" by Theresa Tomlinson, a re-telling of the Maid Marian story.

Only a man with compassion would befriend a homeless schizophrenic living on the streets of Skid Row, LA where most people simply walk by them or act as if the homeless are a nuisance. He saw the potential in Nathaniel and recognized how the disease had stolen so much from him, and he encourages him to start playing the cello again. <br>  <br>  I loved that book & I can't wait for the movie. <br>  <br>  ~ Pax / Peace  : )

zThIaO0Qaa	um maybe because lincoln wasnt really trying to free the slaves he just wanted to give england a reason to not help the south (because they were fighting for states rights-->>SLAVERY) which england had abolished years before and looked down on america because we still enforced it. Also because the south had its own government and they were not heeding any of the norths laws. The south did not have to listen to lincoln because jefferson davis was their president not him. So therefore even though lincoln issued it it was not effective until after the war and the north had successfully won.

kiD47XbTaa	I love this monologue, it's called "Defying Gravity" and it is tied to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. The play's main characters are "Teacher" (inspired by Christa McAuliffe) and her daughter Elizabeth. (McAuliffe's real daughter was 6 years old when her mother died.) <br>  <br>  Elizabeth: The day my mother actually left, a reporter asked me what I thought of my mother going into space. I didn't want to answer so I hid my face behind my grandmother's purse. My brother laughed at me so I hit him on the arm. My grandmother gave us Lifesavers to quiet us down. I told her I wanted cherry so she peeled the paper down until she found one for me. I put it in mypocket for later. Then my mother joined us and she let me hold her hand while she talked to the reporters.<br>  I played with her wedding ring and I was very proud that I was one of the few people who was allowed to touch her hand. She showed the reporters some of the things she was taking up to space. She had a journal and in the journal was a bookmark that I made for her. I had drawn a rocket and stars and Saturn with the rings and I ironed it between two pieces of wax paper so it would be protected from the gamma rays. Then she showed the reporters something her class had given her. I was jealous and I wanted to give her something else. So I took out the Lifesaver. It was fuzzy from the lining of my pocket. While my mother and the reporters talked, I tried to make the Lifesaver presentable. I told myself I had to pick all the lint off the Lifesaver or my mother wouldn't come back. Finally my mother crouched down next to me. She was wearing her blue space suit. I touched the patches on her shoulders. She looked so beautiful. Suddenly I couldn't grasp that this was the woman who every morning sliced banana on my granola. My grandmother kept saying, say good-bye, honey, say good-bye to your mother. But all I could manage to do was hold out the Lifesaver. My mother took it and put it in her pocket and I knew everything would be all right.<br>  <br>  When I watched my mothers ship take off, I saw it go straight into the sky and disappear. When my grandmother told me that my mother went to heaven, I thought that was a part of outer space. I was excited because I thought she'd come back with all kinds of neat presents like a plastic harp or a pair of angel wings. I went to the mailbox everyday looking for a postcard from her that would have clouds or a 3D picture of God. I waited for her to call long distance. When I didn't hear from her I got very angry. I told my father I hated her for being away so long. He told me she had perished in the rocket. I told him that wasn't true, that she was alive. That she had left us and found a family she liked better. He asked me why did I think she was still alive. And I said, because I never saw her dead. These are the reasons I gave myself for why my mother didn't come back. One: I hit my brother on the arm. Two: I wouldn't talk to the reporters. Three: I didn't say thank you to my grandmother for the coloring book. Four: I wouldn't let my father hold me. And five: I didn't get all the lint off the Lifesaver.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you want more information on the actual disaster, try looking up Christa McAuliffe on youtube. Every time I watch her, I start crying!<br>  Here's a link: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOAy1GvSAJY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOAy1GvSA...</a><br>  This is ABC News Coverage from when Christa was chosen to be NASA's first teacher in space.

Elizabeth is Christa's daughter in the play. So, she is talking about her mother's voyage to space, you will understand it more if you read into Christa McAuliffe's death.
sG977Ftqaa	Nicely well-written, I've read many poems myself and yours is pretty good. Lots of descriptions and emotions. You can perhaps add some figurative languages in there, you already had a lot of imagery in it try adding some metaphors and hyperboles.

KHSOVxViaa	Yes, they could.<br>  <br>  The problem was lack of accountability.  Those who had the power to change taxes had no real knowledge of how things were, and had no empathy or concern for the colonists.  Those officials who did had no real power to change the situation.  The whole system of government was not yet accountable to the bulk of ordinary people, and the remoteness of the Americas made those citizens feel even more neglected and disgruntled.<br>  <br>  It was a catch-22; the lack of representation of the colonists meant that there was no way that their concerns and needs could be heard, so the London-based colonial officials had no real pressure to do things differently such as allow representation.  The lack of representation was really the spark that began the move to rebellion.|`|mnIeK8q6aa	Of course they could. With 100% hindsight, it would probably have been the best solution over time. One can always raise taxes later on. <br>  <br>  Only it doesn't work that way. Governments ALWAYS need (more) money. In those days to support the lifestyle of king George, Duke Whatever and Baron Isrich. Today the (US) government needs money for "change".<br>  Supposing the UK government would somehow had kept the US colonies, they would certainly need more money to support the NHS, various (doubtful) community projects. <br>  <br>  Until the people decide 'enough is enough', and start getting seriously angry.|`|G2JHunHjaa	Ha!

In 'Made in America', Bill Bryson writes:<br>  <br>  'Nor, it should be noted, were the taxes levied on the colonists by any stretch onerous or unreasonable.  The principal aim of the stamp duties and other revenue-raising measures was to fund the protection of the colonies.  It was hardly beyond the bounds of reasonableness to expect the colonists to pay for their own defence.  In the 1760s, it was estimated the average American paid about sixpence a year in tax.  The average Briton paid twenty-five shillings - fifty times as much.  And in any case Americans seldom actually paid their taxes.  The hated Twonshend duties raised just ￡295 in revenue in their first year and cost ￡170,000 to implement.  The equally reviled Stamp Act duties were never collected at all.'|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Sure, caving in always works so well. If they gave in then all other of their other taxpayers would have to do is threaten revolt. Besides the taxation was only the final straw.

5odnEcz4aa	Its a bit obvious...... If i were you i would re write some of it, make it more subtle that Samuel is an older man. <br>  I also think that maybe you should stop the monologue at <br>  "You'll be safe Emily, I promise." It leaves an open ending, a bit like a cliffhanger!! This way whoever is auditioning you will want to see more!!|`|0dU50gc9aa	it's not bad. did they request that you write your own? i would be super weary about performing a self written monologue for a college. plus i'm not sure this would be a good monologue. short story yes. of course, reading a monologue and seeing one being performed are two totally different things. but my advice, unless they specifically requested it, would be to find a published monologue from a play. plus, have you timed this monologue. it seems to be rather long. usually monologues for admissions/auditions have  a time requirement under 2 min.|`|xdWzrpiOaa	I'm not really sure about it. I'd suggest going for a monologue from a published play, because at the college I'm applying for that's what they ask for. Then you can research the character in the play who is speaking the monologue, rather than making it all up. It's easier to do a monologue with the background of the play because it helps you understand why the monologue is taking place and what the character is thinking and wanting the audience to feel. I'm not really sure that you took this into account when you wrote the monologue. It's more like story-telling, and I'm not sure you've given yourself a big enough character. Also, the context is dramatic but the way you've written it isn't. I don't think it's going to allow you to act your socks off. It just seems as though someone would just stand there, reciting it. And you can't really have someone else's speech in it because it will just confuse your audience.<br>  I would strongly suggest going to your local library and reading as many plays as you can to find the perfect monologue for you. Make sure you know what your comfort zone is and stick to that. Research the play you take the monologue from and make sure you understand it perfectly. There is no point taking a risk like writing your own monologue for something as important as college.<br>  Good luck, whatever you decide to do.|`|j44s2gqAaa	Thats really good, can you email me if you make anymore as i enjoyed reading that one, what did you do it for? thanks for the good read.
NYU37jfGaa	During the 1800s there were changes in the laws regarding women's property and right to divorce and obtain custody of children.  In the UK the Infant custody Act gave women the right to retain custody of the children in some cases after a divorce, and the Matrimonial Causes Act gave women the right to sue for divorce (previously only a man could obtain a divorce).  In the USA, I think property and divorce rights were granted by some states before others, particularly western states which were anxious to attract female settlers (there was a chronic shortage of women in western states).<br>  <br>  The right to vote was campaigned for by American women from the mid-1800s, and in the UK from the late 1800s.  In the UK the difference between men and women in this respect had been less marked, since most men in the UK did not get the vote until the late 1800s.  In the USA, again some western states gave women the right to vote before the end of the 1800s, starting with Wyoming in 1869.  Women gained the vote throuhgout America in 1920.  In the UK, women over 30 got the vote in 1918, and women over 21 in 1928.<br>  <br>  There were improvementes in women's educational opportunities during the late 1800s, there were more schools for girls, and in both the USA and the UK, women started to attend college from about 1870.<br>  <br>  More varieties of jobs were availabel to women in the course of the 1800s. In the early 1800s, domestic service and factory work were the main forms of employment available to working class girls, and teaching was the man job available to educated women.  From the 1850s, nursing became a respectable job for women.  Elizabeth blackwell became the first woman to graduate from a US medical school in 1850, and mroe women became doctors during the later part of the century.  In the later part of the century women began to be employed in offices in large numbers, since it was found thta women made better typists than men. Women were also employed in large numbers as telephonists.  The new department stores employed large numbers of women as sales clerks.  In general, women were paid less for their work than men were.

IvkZNs0caa	Here is a link to a site that is designed to help people find an appropriate DSLR for their purposes -<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.digital-slr-guide.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.digital-slr-guide.com/</a><br>  <br>  It uses a step by step approach to select something that will meet your needs.  Keep in mind that DSLR cameras generally involve TWO major decisions: 1) The camera BODY and 2) the LENS system.  In most cases lenses will have a useful life far in excess of camera bodies and the best "glass" can easily cost many times more than a body.<br>  <br>  The choice is very personal and often comes down to such things as "What feels comfortable in your hands", "What you want to photograph" and "How comfortable are you with the control system".  Various brands and models can be better suited to specific needs or requirements.<br>  <br>  Some good brands of DSLR in alphabetical order are - Canon, Fujifilm, Leica (big $$$, limited options), Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Pentax and Sony.  Any of these brands produce "professional grade" cameras and have unique advantages.  (Despite what some users on this and other forums say about particular brands).<br>  <br>  HTH.<br>  <br>  Email if you have specific questions.|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a better alternative which combines Leica lense quality and HD720 quality video with sound capability.<br>  <br>  If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_reviews/panasonic_fz28.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...</a><br>  <br>  It just came out on November 4, 2008.<br>  <br>  It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing skateboarding, action sports; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature and concert photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $320 at amazon.com. in the U.S.<br>  <br>  Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/bf/1b/a83ac060ada0881604bad110.L.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2TLXfQKDaa	Your first link isn't working for me, so I can only speak to the D90, it's a solid system and a good direction if you really plan on using it to its full capabilities.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.adorama.com/Search-Results.tpl?page=searchresults&searchinfo=d90" rel="nofollow">http://www.adorama.com/Search-Results.tp...</a><br>  <br>  Check out that link for some more pricing and package options, also be sure you hit up bhphotovideo.com their prices are often on par or a little better/worse than adorama.|`|db77723b96fc01eeed3d85a8a58e79ecaa	If I would you I'd go for the Nikon D40. It's a fantastic little entry level DSLR, and at less than half the price of the D90, it won't put nearly as much of a dent in your bank account. The extra features that you'll be missing from the D90 don't really justify the extra cost for someone who's just starting out with DSLR's. So get a D40 and use the extra money to buy yourself some nice lenses.|`|fxDQqDjzaa	If you think this is something you are going to stick with then go for the better camera now. The camera body is not something you are going to want to replace all that often so you want to be able to grow into it instead of getting one that is not as advanced.|`|AA10275004	You want to take great pictures. We all do, but for some reason we all go out and buy these fancy Digital camera's that produce shots in the 1:1.5 ratio. <br>  <br>  We talk about things like full frame sensors and which one is better Nikon or Canon. The D90 or the Rebel ( neither has the full frame sensor by the way). <br>  <br>  Everyone ask these questions, but the truth is your not learning anything at all buying these cameras. You'll just be like anyone else taking boring old pictures of lakes, trees and friends.<br>  <br>  Not only will you not learn anything but your using a format (1:1.5) that is used up and on it's way out.  So what do you do? You start with a 200-300 dollar 120 format film camera. You master composition, the zone system, aperature, shutter speed, ISO. <br>  <br>  By the time you have these things down you'll know what you need to know and when you finally do go digital you'll be looking for things that you probably aren't aware of yet. Digital is wonderful but taking this leap into technology is not doing you a service, you'll be a nobody that is depending on what you can buy instead of knowing how to take a great picture.<br>  <br>  Many new cameras these days that shoot 120 are very pricey so start with a holga, ( 20-30 bucks) even pro's use a holga for their " crazy you never know what you'lll get abilities" then check out ebay and get a twins lens reflex "tlr" they run 200-300 bucks. You'll drool at how much fun they are. On your way to learning about photography you'll be putting tools in your bag of knowledge that your friends have no idea how much you'll have learned. Then when you have it all buy a nice camera, you'll be ready for it and finally be ready to leap way ahead of all the boring old lakes, trees and friends that you thought was so cool at one time. <br>  <br>  Did you know that many pro's won't even go near a digital camera?<br>  <br>  You can't buy a good picture? ( technology isn't the answer)<br>  <br>  If you think you took a great picture, ask yourself if someone would buy it, if not it's not a great picture.<br>  <br>  The people who do take great pictures know the things that you should know too. Forget the fancy digital stuff for now. The biggest problem people face is that since they can take 100's of pictures without development cost( buying expensive digital) before they know how to shoot is they take 100's of crappy pictures. There are actually pro's out there that take 300 pictures an hour and spend hours and hours throwing every last one of them away- that is beyond stupid, if they had only taken a few months and learned how to shoot in the first place,sigh....

He created an Empire, but it crumbled into pieces with his death.<br>  <br>  I'd look at the secret prophesy he was given while in Egypt - he probably did think himself the son of a God, in the model of Herekles or Ajax or Achilles.

8tVMmzvoaa	The treaty made Germany accept all guilt for World War I, and it also made them pay for all of the damages.  It dumped Germany into constant bankruptcy, and they could never recover.<br>  <br>  They blamed the rest of the world for being too harsh on them, and when Hitler came along promising to raise Germany back to the top, the people listened to him.|`|pvQ1e3Fkaa	I won't write a paper, but basically, with the end of WWII, they (war participants) had to blame somebody. WWI never was won or lost, there was a huge stalemate among the countries, but there was a lot of damage. As we all know, Germany was blamed for the war, and deemed the "loser" and as in all histories, the loser doesn't design the treaty. The Treaty of Versailles besides, saying Germany could not build up an army, said Germany had to pay for the war reparations. Of course, since they were in a depression like the rest of the participants, they could not pay them. It was so bad, that at one point, 4.5 German  "dollars" which before the war was about  1 US dollar inflated to some trillion per dollar. With a terrible depression over Germany, who else, but Adolf Hitler comes to "save" Germany. He swoops in and boosts the morale of the Germans with his whole, "Germany is the best. Aryans rule. and Jews lost us the war" and because there was a time of crisis, the Germans looked for a leader. That leader  just happened to be a crazy fascist dictatorial maniac with the intentions of taking over the world as supreme ruler. So yeah, then Hitler takes, Austria ans Czech and after making agreements with nations (I wont attack you if you let me do what I want) invades Poland, officially stating WWII

iJzIIEdfaa	Not a lot of easily accessible historical sources remain that explain the Gallic command structures. Roman sources mostly describe the Celtic tribes as charging them en masse. Even so, there must have been leaders among the Celts/Gauls who dictated overall military strategy.<br>  <br>  Each tribe consisted of several clans called "pagi". From these pagi, a council of elders dictated the political alignment of the tribe. The council also annually selected a Vergobret, or a judge to adjudicate disputes. <br>  Some tribes like the Arverni were commanded by 'god kings' called their Verrix.<br>  <br>  However when the Gallic people as a whole were threatened, they would lay aside their differences and elect a leader to choose the best course of action, as they did with Vercingetorix when the Romans invaded.
z36j8rmRaa	Just starting out, I'd say first make your writers submit in 12 point double-spaced Times New Roman at least 1 inch margins all around.  You can't edit anything if you don't have room to write down your corrections.  This will mean you will have probably over 200 pages to edit.  I would not charge less than $150 for doing this.  When you get better and more word of mouth you can charge by the word count.  <br>  <br>  Blessings!|`|hwLYv4JFaa	I would charge by the hour. Maybe 3-7 dollars and hour.

Dj78kyxfaa	I love how people on this site always say...get a Gibson. Okay, if you got 4 grand, get a Gibson then.<br>  <br>  Anyways, whats important when picking a first guitar is to go to your local music shop, perhaps with someone that plays guitar and start grabbing guitaris in your price range. Hold them in your hands, do you like the way the neck feels? Does your hand wrap around comfortably? Do you like the looks? Strum the strings, do you like the sound? Hows the action, are the strings too high from the fretboard? That can be adjusted, but its nice to find one right off the back. <br>  <br>  A guitar is a very personal thing that has to fit you. Fenders fit me the best. They are great for my hand size, I love the way the feel, look, and sound, and the action is great on them. <br>  <br>  If you're looking to play electric, standard Squier strats by Fender are nice. The quality of them has really improved and I'm quite pleased with them. Epiphone makes a good starter pack as well, but the epiphone SG specials don't give you much room to upgrade. You can upgrade a squier start and make it fantastic.<br>  <br>  Epiphone makes great acoustics for a good price. Oscar Schmidt also makes some good entry level guitars.<br>  <br>  So basically, go ahead try the guitars out that catch your eye and see what one feels right whne you hold it. Its much more personal than picking a brand name.<br>  <br>  Also, some people will say start with an electric, its easier! Or start with an acoustic, you'll be better at it! I say, start with what you want to start with. Do you want to play rock? Get an electric. Do you want to play country or folk? Get an acoustic. Playing the blues? Well, thats harder...do you want to play solo fingerstyle blues? Get an acoustic. Do you want to play texas or chicago style blues? Get an electric.<br>  <br>  You can always get one or the other later on. I play the blues mostly, and I switch between acoustic and electric. My first guitar was an electric, but I bought an acoustic about 6 months after.|`|hUAUqofgaa	This one: <a href="http://www.zzounds.com/item--IBAIJX121" rel="nofollow">http://www.zzounds.com/item--IBAIJX121</a>|`|8c67a79c352071a0ae417f97c39cec64aa	Could you possibly get up to $400?  If so, many people concur that the Seagull S6 Original for around $397 is the one to get.  It has a nice solid cedar top and cherry back and sides.  It is very well made.  It is also nice that the guitar is a little wider at the nut - making it a little easier to play for beginners.<br>  <br>  If I was buying my first guitar, this is the one I would want.|`|rZUThLfMaa	if your just starting you need to get something along the lines of a yamaha or an ibenez, there the best beginners then when your pretty good get a gibson|`|K3yjfKhJaa	i just started about 4 months ago and i got a fender squier strat the only cost about 120 and there real good

To a lesser extent the dragon in Mulan does too in regards to the hands and eyes and movement, but the body was dragon-like.  The panda in Kung Fu Panda is Anthropomorphic, yet retains most of the body shape of a real panda.  There are variants all over the board on how much humanism is put in.  <br>  <br>  You can find a ton of amateur anthros over on the VCL site.<br>  <a href="http://us.vclart.net/vcl/Artists/New/index01-by-date.html" rel="nofollow">http://us.vclart.net/vcl/Artists/New/ind...</a>
draNVjbkaa	About the various chracters, was this a tv show, movie, or play? And were they lead or supporting roles? You would list it in three columns (/ denote column brakes):<br>  If it's a TV.show:<br>  -Show name/Lead or supporting or guest star/Network<br>  Movie:<br>  -Show name/Lead or supporting/Director<br>  Theatre:<br>  -Show name/various/Theatre or Director (depends on who's more presitgious)<br>  <br>  As far as resume format:<br>  <br>  Here's a link that I made to illustrate what I'm going to talk about:<br>  <a href="http://i707.photobucket.com/albums/ww80/ELDORADO59/scan0002.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i707.photobucket.com/albums/ww80/...</a><br>  <br>  RESUME-ALWAYS use the 3 column format!<br>  Here's the standard LA format. In NY, it's usually the same but with Theatre being higher up than Film/TV (/ denotes column breaks):<br>  <br>  At the top and centered:<br>  Name (Centered and is largest in font size)<br>  Union affiliation (if any)<br>  CELL Phone Number<br>  Email<br>  <br>  Far Left side below the top and centered stuff:<br>  Height <br>  Weight<br>  Hair color<br>  Eye color<br>  <br>  Right side opposite of statistics:<br>  Agent logo with contact info (sometimes if you have an agent, you can remove your own cell phone and email address. Then weirdos that find your stuff in the dumpster can contact them instead of you)<br>  <br>  Film<br>  Title/(Lead, supporting, featured)/Director<br>  <br>  Television<br>  Title/(Lead, guest star, co-star, regular, featured)/Network<br>  <br>  Theatre<br>  Title/Specific character played/Production company or director depending on who is more prestigious.<br>  <br>  Commericials<br>  ALWAYS put "List available upon request!" Do keep a separate list of the commercials with the Casting directors involved in case an agent asks.<br>  <br>  Training<br>  Skill learned/School or teacher/Location (LA, NY?)<br>  OR<br>  Skill learned/Teacher/School Location<br>  ie. Cold Reading/Margie Haber/Margie Haber Studios, LA,CA<br>  <br>  Special Skills/Abilities<br>  Be creative with this. When I was starting out and interviewing with agencies, they would usually go straight there and talk about my special talents and even had me demonstrate some of them<br>  <br>  DON'T:<br>  -Put extra work<br>  -Put Modeling/Print gigs. You make a separate resume for that.<br>  -Lie<br>  -Put age. If an agent asks you when you meet with him or her, then tell the truth. It's for legal reasons. ie. Under 18 can't work normal hours or you have to be at least 25 to do a beer commercial.<br>  -Put your home phone number or address unless you want weirdos coming to your house.<br>  -Put dates. It ages you!<br>  -Have it separate from your headshot. It should be cut to fit and stapled to the back of your headshot.<br>  <br>  If you don't have too many credits or none at all, have a lot of training. That will show that you're still serious. Also be creative with your special skills and abilities.|`|JfT65q88aa	Just put<br>  <br>  Show------Various Roles------Where or what company or director<br>  <br>  Instead of various roles you could just put Lead or Leading Role OR you could just put the most recognizable role.<br>  <br>  Example, I was in Annie and I play a cabinet member, servant, and "hooverlite bum" ...so to keep things looking neat and simple I put<br>  <br>  Annie-----Servant------XYZ Co. <br>  <br>  and stuck it at the bottom of the list.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Looking at Eldorado's advice I must point out a few things...<br>  1. Don't put you're weight. No one needs to know how much you weigh it's not a wrestling weight class division.<br>  2. No need to put eye color or hair color if you're attaching a Head Shot. You're headshot will be color and therefore telling them what you're eye color and hair color is. Back when actors used black and white head shots, that information was important. The times have changed. (this is advice coming from an agent)<br>  3. The resume format he gave you was god aweful. Too many things to criticize so I'll just link you to a great looking resume: <a href="http://www.johnvirag.com/jv_images/ActingResume.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.johnvirag.com/jv_images/Actin...</a><br>  <br>  That's not my resume, but it's format is perfect. Mine looks similar but my theater credits are at the top instead of film since I'm predominantly a stage actor.
