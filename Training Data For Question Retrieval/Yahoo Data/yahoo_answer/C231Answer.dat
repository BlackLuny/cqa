6a6c83f0712736b72dcc0dab2a8ad50faa	I found out that I was pregnant because I had cramping pains.   I saw three to doctors before they finally checked to see if I was pregnant.  The pains were kind of like gas pains but with no gas and they happened after I had an orgasm also.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	It could be, but chances are it's just menstrual cramps.    Just wait until you miss your period. Best advice I can give you.|`|h7ZNTNgEaa	I felt some at five. I would say it wouldn't be too soon take a test and see. Good luck  :  )|`|Iulcrme3aa	I think you are pregant because your uterus stretches when the baby insde grows bigger. Take a pregnancy test or check with your doctor
AsmWOrlmaa	yeah I think you shouldnt worry too much.... I used to have really heavy flows and then I went on this diet, I alos have a very stressful job, after a while I noticed that my period got lighter..... are you quite regular? my friends who have had implantation bleeding said it was brownish... just in case...why dont you go and get some blood work done?|`|MLoef4K7aa	no u should be fine|`|hxYebB3Zaa	Don't be worried. It's completely normal to have a lighter period when you're not eating as much. I've experienced that aswell, so you're not alone.|`|ky4cjPlQaa	Your friend was right.  It's probably stress and your diet.  If you don't have it next month or it's real light again, then take a pregnancy test.|`|QimXCTJMaa	No, there isn't anything to be worried about. If you don't get your period next month, then you should be a little concern. But being light when you're stressed out is normal.
Utb9T5k0aa	Actually, yes, you very well can determine the sex of the baby by lunar phases. I saw a website recently that was exactly on the pulling of the moon. It has to do with the ovulation of the woman and what day it hits tryin gto conceive the child and teh mans sperm count. based on a specific color chart it will tell you on teh sepcific date you try to conceive what percent will be a girl or a boy. Also try these websites..    http://www.baby2see.com/gender/index.htm...|`|EEuIiWV3aa	I heard that you can kinda chose the sex of your baby by the time you have sex. When your sperm goes there are the sperm that will produce a boy and then there is the sperm that will produce a girl. The girl sperm lives much longer then the boy sperm, but the boy sperm can swim way faster then the girl sperm. So if you want to have a boy try and have sex with your woman a day before or the day she is ovulating, that way the first sperm to get there will most likely be a boy, where if you did it a day before ovulation and the sperm has been in there for a while it will be mostly the longer living girl sperm that gets there. Good Luck, were trying for a boy to!|`|dfefa26d6df78466be6b868b75b04475aa	wow... you really can't choose the gender of the baby... maybe you can adopt if you really want a boy|`|d55138a4d5d66af8e3e5cb942e8d8db1aa	dont want to sound rude but your not god and dont have the right to chose the sex of your next child.

SGpPVjiYaa	well I know my parents would worry (if I ever had a boyfriend) but they just got to trust me that I will make the right choice with a guy and not pick total bone heads. I personally would not date some one who didn't respect my family, others and me. I guess you have to teach people to respect others no matter what sex. I agrree with you I would treat my kids boy and girl the same....Overprotective    If you let a guy go to a wild party and don't let the girl the same age go then that is saying you don't trust the girl and that is why teens might sneak out to make the parents resent ever saying that so they go and do something stupid|`|oVuoiEk8aa	Okay? that's dumb how they teach their girls to wait, yet let their guys do whatever.|`|xBfDlmmDaa	i can see why parents protect there gurls more....my parents do that....not really anymore because i'm 19 and have a boyfriend of 4 years and i'm 3 months pregnant.....but when i have both girls and boys i would teach them both to be careful.... i think that most guys that use girls for sex its because there parents didn't teach them what was right and what was wrong....i think that if i gurl gets pregnant that she has more responsibilitly then the guy in the relationship would especially if they aren't together....i think that guys need to think about the stuff they do and they need to be protected just as much as gurls do. i think that all parents should teach there boys to respect gurls....thats what makes a good man... i think that boys that respect gurls make better boyfriends for obvious reasons|`|eRyVH2wMaa	Well I have 2 boys and if I did have a girl I would have the same rules for her as I do the boys|`|cf98d4945a0896712e6aa89234f858c2aa	wow! the problem here is that not every parent teaches their boys to respect the girls so naturally we worry about letting our girls be around those boys. heck, i worry about my boys being around those boys who's parents don't have and teach their kids the same standards I have. i don't want any of it rubbing off. so i guess i am equally overprotective, as some people would like to put it, with my boys and girl.|`|8d6fa0d60c5f4213ba77a881409a9f99aa	I agree.|`|NpL17llAaa	I have three children, two girls ages 11 and 13 and a son age 16.  The standards are the same.  Communication is wide open in our home and everyone is subject to the same questions.  I do not believe that any of my children are anymore safe then the other because of the society that we live in, so I am very candid and honest with all three of my children.  When they have questions, I answer them no matter how uncomfortable I may be (and they know this).  I know that their best defense is the truth.      I also extend my concerns to the people they hand around.  My son recently was "dating" a young ladt from a single parent home.  The two of them would crack up over the over-protected views of her mother.  I explained to both of them exactly why she behaved as she did and why they should understand it as well.

I'm sure you still can. Why, are you planning on having one? Or you're trying to have condomless sex? Either way, I'm sure you can still get pregnant. Even if you're on CD24, I'm sure you still can.

For example my cycles are usually about 32 days.  So, you subtract 14 days and that is the day you should ovulate.  So unless your cycles are 38 days (which after 35days you will have a period but not necessarily ovulate) probably not.|`|bbYW0nSmaa	possible - you need to check to see when you ovualte though.|`|EeQkHLITaa	no birth control is 100% not even having your tubes tied.

2CKj784Eaa	You'll learn as time goes on. I know that sounds like useless information, but it's true. I became a single mom to my triplets, now 17yrs, when they were 5. My husband wanted nothing to do with them or me and we went through some pretty rough times. I too had a hard time keeping a job (im an accountant) especially during tax season with the long hours. So much of it was going to daycare so I had my mom move in with us and that really didn't help much.   I moved out of my area and into a friendly med-income town. I found a lot of help through other mother's in the area when it came to daycare, carpooling and after school activities. My neighbor was a single mom. She got my kids off the school bus at 3, I came home from work at 4 and watched her kids until 9 while she was at work.   I learned to multitask, to do a lot of the household chores at night, do things ahead of time and not plan too much ahead. I made a budget of how much I could spend, what I needed to buy and made ends meet. With time I learned what worked best for me and my kids.   Southern CA is a pretty wealthy area and I don't have any idea what it's like to live there. You need to budget. Find how much you have and what you need to get each month. Find a family household daycare and a job you can work at home. Maybe finding a job that involves children where your kids can be with you is a good idea.   If you give me a little more detail about your situation and e-mail me, I might be able to give you some more advice. I wish youy the best of luck|`|AA11918992	It is very hard raising children in California. I've been in your position.     You have to get some extra cash flowing in and the only way to do this is have purse parties/candle parties/etc.     As for the child care, there's a program based on your income, regardless if you are married, divorced, never married etc...that will help you with child care. The program is called 4 C's. Give them a try and see what happens.|`|kBCkv4ISaa	Marry a rich guy, sorry.|`|RKE7dSJcaa	maybe you should look at religion. they may be able to help|`|2PmQz45Waa	you entrusted a man to be the fianancia controler. you should have considered more financial aspects of having kids and included the risk of divorce. while he may be a jerk and you may be a good woman, you totaly goofed.|`|clMFUD4Yaa	Hi...I am in nearly the same boat as you...(really, our situations sound ALOT alike)I sm in southern california and am the newly single mom of 4 small children.  My husband left late last year when i was pregnant with my fourth.  I do not have any fast answers but have been looking to connect with a few single moms in Southern California.  Email me if you want to chat/commiserate.      **************Well, I thought I could answer again, but I am going to edit my original response.  There are many things that can be done to make ends closer to being met.  First, look into your cities FREECYCLE group.  It gives you the opportunity to gain some of the things you need and pass along those that you do not.  I recently received a dryer and a fan and was able to pass along some clothing and kitchen items.      Next, take advantage of the California sun!!!  Set up a clothes line!  You may be groaning, but it is actually almost enjoyable.  I find that I feel better because it forces me to get outside (so easy NOT to do when you have so much on your plate) and I actually get the laundry done faster!!  Besides, it saves gas and electricity!  With the warm nights, I have been able to hang a load before I go to bed and it is dry in the AM.  On a day like today...some of the load is dry before I even finish hanging all of it!  Other benefits...towels dry better when hung, laundry feels more fresh and CLOTHES LAST LONGER!    Now, I may get alot of groans with this one BUT...do you have a child or children in diapers or pullups?  If so, switch to cloth.  Believe me, I was AGAINST it, but cloth is wonderful.  There are fewer leaks (BONUS...less laundry ) and are very easy to wash.  I spent about 80 dollars when my son was born and THAT IS IT!!!!  They also make very nice cloth training pants that are absorbant AND waterproof.  I would be happy to give you some references if you like.    Use thrift stores whenever possible for clothes...especially the childrens.  The Goodwill store here in our area has great stuff.  If you HAVE to buy pants for your oldest...and have other children of the same sex, (or even if you do not)consider SEARS when they are on sale.  They are a bit more expensive but The benefit of this is that they have a life time warranty plan.  Buy a pair of jeans and if they wear out, they replace them.  I have had luck witht his...they seem to wear out just in time to get a new pair for the next child.  I have 2 older boys..when my daughter got into the size I had from the older boys, I had a friend sew a ruffle on the leg hem and pocket to make them  more girly.  Hopefully she will wear them out so I can replace them for my baby boy :)    I know it is HOT here, but try to refrain from AC use.  Like I said, I was ablt to get a fan from FREECYCLE so I have one in every room.  i keep a bowl of water in the kids bedroom and they have a wash cloth they can dip into  when they get too hot.  They love wetting their face and then standing in front of the fan :)  i even walk around the house with a wash cloth on my neck.  Remember to drink plenty of water!    If you are close to me, I would love to arrange to pass along some of my children's things.    Email me :)    I also have no degree.  My husband and i decided together that i would quit school and stay at home with the children.  Look into the local Universities.  many of them have an on campus child care center and the universities often offer funding to students.  I started back to school this past summer.  I was able to get financial aid and funding for childcare so that some of my children will be on campus with me.    For work, I do whatever odd jobs I can.  Be it run errands for an ill person at Church, to transcription for an Auto Insurance Company (you do not need training for this) to helping a friend who owns an insurance company.  Most of the work at home opportunities are scams, but some are real.  If you are crafty and good with your hands and think you can mass-produce, there are opportunities.  Another thing I do is Mystery shopping.  Companies pay you to evaluate a business and write a report.  You usually have to pay up front, but most companies are paying with pypal now so it is very fast.  There are shops for things you may need to do regularly...grocery stores, oil change places, clothing stores.  I use a mystery shop opportunity for the kids and I to have a treat at a fast food place or go out to dinner.  Since it is reimbursed (plus a report fee) I feel good about it.    Probably the most important advice I can give you is to keep your head up!  Ignore those that persecute you for "not preparing for what COULD happen".  Like either of us expected NOT to me married until death do us part.  Also there are resources out there to help you short term.  I have learned NOT to be ashamed to make use of them for the time being.  Someday I plan to give back ten-fold and there is not shame in that.    OH...I just remembered..check out www.thegrocerygame.com......it is a system that utilizes coupons and subscription to this ladies list, but it can save HUNDREDS....I walk out of the store, frequently, with a shopping cart full having paid under 50 dollars.    All my best to you!  I hope I have helped you in some way!    Mom to 4  kerri|`|iGHpMBbCaa	Wow you have alot on your plate! I'm sorry to hear what you are going through (divorce). Anyways I read your comment and thought I would respond because I have 3 small children all under 5 1/2, my husband works but recently got an enormous paycut and our family is struggling and I've been thinking I have to go back to work but how do I do that and pay for day care will I really be making any money??? But about 2 months ago a friend of mine introduced me to a company called Mona Vie, its a network marketing company that has a phenomenal buisness plan and you can make so much money with it working at home. People I've met are making between 5-10,000 a week just 6-12 months into this can you imagine. Its so easy everyone wants an opportunity like this. Their product is a health juice that is helping with small issues all the way up to larger health issues arthritis, cancer ect.  I'm not going to go on about this if you are interested in more explaination let me know we'd love to have you on our team...  Jen

sxecXFgraa	There is a child credit that you may qualify for and depending on your income and how much you paid in taxes, you may get more back.  You can also claim a portion of your child care and medical expenses.  The father can claim him, he'll need his social.  If your are the primary care giver for your son, you should be the one claiming him for taxes, unless you and the father have court papers saying who can claim him on certain years.

Day one, the client gets "laminaria" inserts put into the cervix, also known as "seaweed tampons".  These begin dialation by expanding, similar to a loofah sponge.  Contractions begin and the client goes into labor.  Day two, the client returns to get more "laminaria" inserts and then rapid contractions begin.  Day three, the client returns for "laminaria" removal, then the abortion.  Keep in mind, the client will not be able to drive or keep much food down and will need someone at all times to care for her during the procedure.

9yeyzQi5aa	I really dont think you can tell if its a boy or girl based on that because i had the worse morning sickness where i could barely stand up at work and im having a boy...But my cousin also had a boy and she had no morning sickness so it really just depends..But it might be too early to tell because normally it will really start at 8-9 weeks.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Uh-oh! -Triplets !!! Brace yourself; morning sickness is about to be the LEAST of your Problems!  :o|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	GET AN U/S DONE. YOU CANNOT TELL BY IF YOU PUKE OR NOT, OR HOW YOUR CARRYING OR WHAT THE HEART RATE IS. IF YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE OF WHY I SAY THIS MESSAGE ME. AND I WILL TELL YOU.|`|4FQKWxB9aa	I'm 7 weeks also, I haven't thrown up at all, but have been nauseous quite a bit.... I really don't think that has anything to do with the gender, I wonder the same thing because i want a little girl so bad, & with my son I was SOOO SICK for the first 3 months, but the rest of my pregnancy & labor was fine.... so i'm hoping this one is the exact opposite.... good luck! & Congratulations!|`|52U22fiAaa	Baby #1 : Girl, NO morning sickness.  Baby #2: Girl, sick for 16 weeks!!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Its a wives tale sorry.<br>  <br>  I had very little morning sicknees, and im having a girl|`|zni8l1Syaa	Well let me state first that there is no definate way to tell if it is a boy or girl based soley upon morning sickness, but I was extremely ill with my son Noah. I am 13 weeks pregnant again and I am way sicker this time around, I dont dont know what I am having but I will soon find out. I wish you the best!|`|hoJv3BIaaa	Sorry, but I think that is an old wives tale. I got my morning sickness at about 6-7 weeks, so it might be a little early to tell if you will have morning sickness or not. My sister in law has had no morning sickness  at all, and she has 2 boys and 1 girl. Congrats on the baby, and best of luck.|`|plI0WOrUaa	These are old wives tales actually.  I don't think they have any fact behind them.  They say that if your pregnancy causes you difficulty its a girl, and if its easy its a boy.  There are a ton of them you can find online.  Its not for sure thought.  Its just for fun.|`|sVPToYvKaa	That it just an old tale.<br>  Everyone's pregnancy is different.<br>  You normally don't know the gender until at least 18 weeks, sometimes it's 20.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the Pregnancy : ]|`|yrF1q1mdaa	i can't say for you but personally i was never really sick, I just felt like blah and didn't want to do too much and I'm having a boy.  :)|`|PYZ1CMj3aa	lol it's not true to go by that, it's a myth. pregnancy affects every woman differently.
553d65e6b054bb10fd35c5dfbadb844eaa	Sorry ladies, but any time you consent to sex, you have consented to abortion. There is no other possibility. Miscarriage occurs with 7 out of 10 conceptions. Women who are aware of this fact realize that for each birth, they must account for two abortions. And the fact is that if it is their choice to have sex then it is their choice to have an abortion. ____ Sorry, it is just a fact.----- The excuse for most pro lifers is that since it is their choice it is OK because they do not intend to have an abortion. --- But of course no one in their right mind "intends" to have an abortion. So the truth is that pro lifers are only pro life if it is someone else that makes the choice to have sex and then abort. When they make the choice, then they surely did not intent to abort--- ha!|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	This is a tricky one. I personally do not label myself "pro life" because I support life all the time, not just when it has to do with abortion, I also support life when it has to do with, people in prison, drug addicts, death penalty and so on. <br>  <br>  My view is this,A D&C has nothing to do with a moral question, there are many reason why a Doctor will preform a D&C, I had one for an abnormal period after I had my first child, I think you mean  D&E or a D&X|`|uLeg1Aniaa	There is nothing wrong with having a D&C after a miscarriage.  A D&C isn't having an abortion its clearing out what is left after someone loses their baby.  There isn't anything wrong with it since they lost their baby from no fault of their own.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	A D&C is necessary to clear out the contents of the uterus after a miscarriage, not an abortion. I think it's a legitimate and often needed surgery. I see nothing wrong with it, and I'm pro-life.
9yeyzQi5aa	I asked my doctor the same question at my last appointment she told me that the ultrasound date it always more than likely going to change and if you know the exact date of your LMP that is 80% more accurate. I just figure anywhere within that week of when the LMP suggests and the u/s suggests is a good time....Congrats on your baby!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  With an ultrasound it can vary depending on if you catch the baby while its growing rapidly..|`|kaqPSgTVaa	They ultrasound isn't measuring how far along you are it's measuring the size of the baby. The baby is measuring in as a baby that is 16 weeks 4 days.  You probably are 17 weeks 4 days the baby is just measuring differently according to SIZE.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Ultrasound dates are much more accurate as they measure babies size.<br>  <br>  A weeks difference is normal|`|CJkrXeDgaa	Personal experience, go with the ultrasound. Especially if you have a good ultrasound tech.<br>  I have PCOS, so it isn't unusual for me to miss several periods in a row, but still be ovulating. <br>  My first due date was Aug 14th. I argued this until I was blue in the face! switched to a midwife, got an ultrasound and ended up with a due date of Sept. 30th.<br>  With my second baby, she could tell what day I conceived, the due date, and at the end she was within an ounce of delivery weight.<br>  Technology is pretty fascinating!|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	Ultrasound dates are always more accurate than LMP dates, unless there's a huge discrepancy between the two, in which case the doctor would need to find out the reason why.|`|yrF1q1mdaa	ultrasound|`|ZIkSvP6taa	Im alot earlier but the same thing happened to me this week...I am spotting and had an ultrasound - my LMP dates told me I was 6wks, 5 days - ultrasound said 5wks 5days - Doc told me to go with the ultrasound - it is more accurate especially in early pregancy (before 20 weeks)<br>  <br>  Good luck :-)
CKnHMYHnaa	This is a common problem and it's absolute crap that insurance won't help out here.  If you've had frequent miscarriages then, for the life of me, I can't figure out why they wouldn't cover you to find out what is wrong.  Can't they code it as diagnostics and not infertility? Insurance may cover it then.  I think it is so important to find out what the problem is here even if they won't cover more advanced infertility procedures.|`|97361e0bea1a7c814e1e0591ab668edaaa	The insurance companies will only cover what they term as real true illnesses, they wont cover that as it is something outside of their coverage, since its your choice to find out what is going out, you will have to cover that cost. check out if your state is a part of the mandated infertility insurance list, you can contact your state's insurance commissioner for that info.|`|8c31015e5379247f495631e2d02da1afaa	you could request a progesterone test, that is a very common reason for miscarriage or common reason for not being able to maintain a pregnancy, and it's easily fixed, i just had one, and paid $80, my prescrip cost $30 for a months worth, my insurance covers nothing either, i just keeping asking what each thing costs and doing one thing at a time, good luck and just keep telling them what you need from them.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Insurance will only cover stuff absolutely medically necessary, they're too cheap for anything else unless you have a really amazing insurance company. Talk to a lawyer, they would be able to find any possible loop holes for you if there are any.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That may be a health issue for you that could compromise your longevity, it should be investigated simply because you may have a bleeding disorder or clotting or many things that impact your health.   Once the reason for recurrent miscarriage is addressed (it's a symptom of an underlying illness/disease/defect) you should be able to carry a pregnancy.|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	You could get short term insurance that is specifically for infertility...though if you dont get accepted you may have to pay out of pocket.
XmJZkFuMaa	My daughter was born in November, and we claimed her for the year.  <br>  <br>  We use an online service and they ask questions like when your baby was born, and that double-checks the law for you.  So I'm very sure so long as she was born before December 31st then you can claim her, or else the online forms would say you couldn't.|`|AA11210211	You can claim her,My son was born August 5th of 2005 and when we filed in feb. of 06 we claimed him and got the money.Unless things have changed in 4 yrs you can.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	as long as you had the baby as of 12/31 of that year, the baby is treated as if you had him for the whole year.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	As long as she was born in 2008, you can claim her.

HpWCjBv6aa	Did she already make most of the cards, or did she only make one sample?  And how did you go about picking out the design and/or layout for these cards?  And how expensive are they?<br>  <br>  If they're inexpensive, then I'd say just keep them if you don't want to hurt her feelings.  Of course, if she's in this business, she'll probably be used to it by now.  However, I'd just try to talk to her about the things you like and don't like about the cards.<br>  <br>  eta: If she only has the mock cards made, ask her to change the paper or the ribbon, if she has it available.  If not, you may have to go without, because it could make the price more expensive if she has to purchase new materials.  Also, since she's only made the mock cards, you could tell her that you're not interested and that you're sorry and invest elsewhere.|`|k0SSCpG9aa	you could try giving her more ideas about what you'd like them to look like and who knows maybe she'll rise to the occasion but if you don't end up liking them them then you could tell her something like look i like the cards you made but i think that they just aren't me and hope she understands|`|T4gMdDXaaa	The people you are giving the cards to arent going to read them everyday and will most likely throw them in the trash.Keep them Who cares about a card?Will the cards have money in it?|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	When you're talking to her, say:<br>  "Those look really nice!" (When talking about the ones she made.) Then say:<br>  "I like these ones too, can we try these?"|`|b1TBeG3yaa	if she hasn't finished the cards yet, suggest you work on them together, that way you can put exactly what you want on them, if she has finished them then keep them, you never know if you put them on display in your room some1 else may come in and say they really like them, then you could send 1 of them to that person|`|72b18188bab9fa5e6eca215f0a556820aa	Did you tell what you wanted?

QSthtKxIaa	Well, I've never had a miscarriage (or been pregnant for that matter) I'm currently studying child Development and a while back our teach was telling us about her miscarriage (or spontaneous abortion if you want to get technical) and it is honestly one of the saddest things I’ve ever heard I know quite a few people went into their next lesson in tears, so I can’t imagine how terrible it must have been at the time.<br>  <br>  I image miscarriage is different for everyone but I suppose the main feelings would be sadness (for the loss) mixed with anger (why me?!), feeling that you are not good enough, loneliness (no one understands you) and a whole host of other feelings…  <br>  <br>  You can read about all the technical stuff here: <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/pmiscarriage/0,,42s1,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/...</a><br>  <br>  And  here are a few true stories: <a href="http://blightedovum.kokopuff.net/stories.html" rel="nofollow">http://blightedovum.kokopuff.net/stories...</a>

Congrats! :) Yes it does look like a girl! :) :) (: (:|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	Wow, congratulations! so cute.<br>  <br>  But it is possible that it is still too early to tell. All babies look like girls in the very beginning, because the male organs are still developing and what can be seen depends on the position of the baby. I didn't see my boy's until the 25th week or so.|`|SkFgDxpEaa	well idk what gender it is cuz idk what to look for. the guy who told u it was a girl might have taken a sample from the fetus and it tested positive for girl maybe. oh and congrats on a baby girl or boy, hehe|`|EAeffKqSaa	From that angle it looks like it can be a girl but then it kinda looks like the bottom of.... well let's just say turtle shell if you know what I mean??<br>  <br>  Did the tech get another angle to make sure its a girl?<br>    If you got another angle and for sure it's a girl then go all out and buy cute little girl clothes but if ya'll are not for sure buy mostly yellow / neutral clothes. <br>   They did my 19 week scan last week and my little man has a little turtle. <br>  Good luck and congrats to you.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	i dunno, thats not a really clear picture .. but itd lean more towards a girl then a boy by the pic|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	to me yes but i am not a pro  i am preggo with a boy now ( have a girl ) and you can so see his stuff <br>  my girl looked like lines so i say girl 4 u<br>  :)|`|UxlL89rHaa	I am pretty sure the Ultrasound tech would know more than your boyfriend.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	if your ultrasound tech said it was then it is. cute|`|T0pkW783aa	Sure looks that way.  The technician put "girl" on the sonogram and that is what they usually do when they know so, congratulations; looks like a little sweetheart is coming soon!!|`|9yeyzQi5aa	it looks like a girl to me....Congrats!!!!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I couldn't tell 100% from the ultrasound, but typically by 19 weeks the penis and testicles are quite visible.|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	It looks like a girl to me!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Cant really tell - i don't see the three lines like i did at my ultrasound (im having a girl)|`|Bg6txvxqaa	Well, I'd say it's a girl cos when we had our ultrasound done at 19 weeks, it was was obvious which one was the boy!!! lol<br>  <br>  We saw 3 faint lines on the girl same kind of shot as you of the butt!|`|UHIi8AuQaa	hi,congrats i had my 3rd baby last july<br>  no u need 3 lines for a girl.........<br>  it looks like a boy to me|`|cWxwotjcaa	Oh yeah, if it was a boy the ding dong would be sticking out of the middle of the lips * pardon the detail* but mine looked exactly the same and they said they were 99.8% sure it was a girl...yay for you and me!! we're both having girls!!!|`|0c44c557b5bc5a2df5e3cbbcf028239baa	Sorry, I can't tell.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	To soon to tell.|`|XvV1id3qaa	Sure, why not. I think is a baby girl, because if the doctor said is a girl, then is a girl, cuz the doctor knows more about.|`|fUjsE0LRaa	yes, with boys, the scrotum is quite large and often you can see a penis and testicles, well you did with both of my sons,|`|tcHkn0VIaa	yes it looks like a girl. Congratulations|`|avpv7u8saa	To be honest<br>  <br>  I can't tell <br>  <br>  but congrats|`|HMzsm50vaa	Girl.  You're boyfriend might be in slight denial simply because most guys want a boy so bad.

vLJKNkNLaa	God and Jesus will always love you. I don't care how horrible you are-they love you.<br>  Give it time, and if it is meant to be....you will get pregnant.|`|9zwSclnLaa	Well, you have to do more then just pray.  It takes sex between a man and a woman to create your little "bundle of joy to love".|`|Vv6Dg6Q0aa	Pray all you want but sorry- it takes SPERM and an EGG to make a baby.<br>  <br>  Guess you'll figure that out pretty quickly after 40+ years of non-stop praying with no baby to show for it.<br>  <br>  And you posted this in teen, so I have no idea why anybody's even advising you to have a kid. <br>  Jeez.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	You have to do more then pray i'm afraid. Youe need to make a baby also. Good Luck|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	Maybe its his way of telling you not right now. Some of gods greatest gifts are unanswered prayers. He knows what he's doing.|`|Hi5h9739aa	Gos is always listening to you.  He does things for a reason.  Have some faith.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	just pray god listen to you
cen8SIssaa	its hard to say what is "normal" when it comes to children that age. but if his piping is working fine i wouldn't worry, since you said its not diarrhea. <br>  <br>  Just have a call to his doc and they should be able to calm your nerves.|`|kRbkiPvnaa	our 10 month old is the same way, The doctor says it's perfectly normal.
xreWOKBYaa	Yes, speak with the boys parents, just so they know they might need to have another lesson on "no hitting", but you can't blame him he is just a little boy.<br>  Fire your nanny, you hired her to watch your kids, which she obviously was not doing! Just for a second... BS! does this Nanny have any license or degree's in child development?!?! what a *****. I can not believe she would let this happen to a child in her care!<br>  Take your daughter to the doctor, send the nanny the bill.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Did you take her to hospital? You must! Damage is not always immediate but can show up later...days later! Then you must get rid of that sitter for good! No sensible person leaves a baby alone in the room with a 3 year old! Last year there was a case where a baby got crushed by her sister who basicall sat on her while she was in one of those inflatable play rings...her Mother was in the bath...a 3 year old has no sense and is not to be trusted around a baby your sitter is NOT trustworthy!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	both...also take her to the dr i'm sure shes fine but just to be cautious.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	I would find a new sitter and talk to the boys parents. I wouldn't point all the blame on the boy, your sitter should not have left a 6 month old alone with a 3 year old. I have a 5 month old and a 3 year old and I will never leave them alone for one second. That's why someone invented baby gates!  He had to have hit your daughter pretty hard to leave a mark also she could have made that story up to cover up something she did, but I would have to find another sitter.|`|fHjSonssaa	Don't panic.  I would call her DR, explained what happened, tell DR where bruise is...and then see what they say.  It sucks that it happened, but the good news is that babies heads are actually very resiliant- they have enough "padding".  This is not to say the issue should be taken lightly.  My son has had some head bags and I was concerned- but we watched him VERY carefully.  <br>  After the injury has been evaluated, fire the sitter. <br>  I almost "fired" my partner after he accidently fell back asleep while watching our son, so he fell off the bed.  Everyone (on here) told me I was over-reacting.  They can kiss my a**.<br>  <br>  You should have someone responsible enough to know that 3 year old are the equivalent of leaving your baby in the room with an unfamiliar animal (not is ALL cases, but in most)-<br>  <br>  I guess I would just woudn't want to leave my child with someone who I  might second-guess at any given moment due to history.<br>  <br>  Chances are, it won't happen again.  But maybe the sitter needs a wake-up call.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I'd start by getting her injuries evaluated, and hold the sitter responsible for leaving her unattended with a preschooler in the room (never trust little kids around babies, bad things happen).|`|lGKq9NXbaa	Do both. find a new sitter and talk to the boy's parents. She couldn't have left for "just a second" if she has a huge bruise on her head.|`|e583cebee349ef9a997c192a1abad42aaa	You can't really blame the 3 year old boy. Although clearly he has problems, hitting a baby at that age.<br>  You have to blame the sitter who should never ever have left baby alone with a 3 year old for even a moment.<br>  When I had my second, my first was 2, I knew I could not leave them alone, even if I went to the toilet I took one with me.<br>  You need to file a complaint against the sitter in order to protect other children and you need to find a decent sitter asap and move your baby there.<br>  You have a duty to protect your baby. No baby should ever be hit. Most sitters will know that and take appropriate care.|`|pULDq0oSaa	if i were you i would get your child head checked out because it could be alot more serious then you think. i would also talk to the boys parents so they can teach him a lessonon not hitting. and then lastly i would fire your sitter shes suppose to watch them not leave them alone beacuse a kid cannot get a bruise if the sitter was only gone for  a second. and who told you it was the little boy? u never know it might be the sitter who hit her and said it was the boy but i hope that would be the case|`|AA11481889	Um...your sitter should be fired....today...now...not when you get around to finding another.<br>  <br>  If she's licensed....she needs to be reported because her neglect and carelessness has led to the injury of your child.<br>  <br>  The children should NEVER have access to the infants...period.<br>  <br>  You could talk to the boys parents I suppose...but what are they going to do about it?  They weren't there to control their child...they entrusted that same worthless sitter. <br>  <br>  If anything you may want to let them know that it happened and that you're removing your child, and that they may want to talk to the sitter themselves to find out why their child was left alone long enough to assault an infant.<br>  <br>  When did this happen?  Have you taken the baby to the pediatrician?  I would rip the sitter a new one and can her immediately.|`|lSqb7Fraaa	I would definitely start by taking your daughter to a pediatrician and getting her injuries evaluated, though they may not seem serious, any blow to the head at such a young ago must be evaluated immediately.  as far as your nanny goes, if you for some reason STILL like her, who don't u just install a nanny cam? see whats really going on and if its just "for a second" that she leaves the kids unattended, or if its much longer than that.  not much will come from talking to the boys parents hes only 3 years old hes just playing.  just tell him hes playing "like a boy" and shes not a boy. (need to speak in lament terms or else he wont understand.  my bet is to go with the nanny cams.  i cant even begin to tell u the horror stories that have been caught on those things.<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|4iXL4C6paa	yes you should definitely look for a new sitter, I have a 3 year old and a 51/2 month old and you just really cant leave them alone, she always wants to hold him, drag him around, hug him extra tight, pick him up by his neck....I mean seriously you cant leave them alone and she should know that|`|kwMuRDFjaa	I would look for a new sitter and talk to the boy's parents.|`|chlvKoXqaa	of course talk to her parents, have the baby get a head scan never ever allow that boy alone with her again, damage could have been done to her brain, and you might not know for years,|`|vp1Ii9Tdaa	what the f*** was that dum a** thinking to leave the todler alone with  an infant but i agree with kristin fire her and hope she has a deploma and hope she gets reported to the police good god what the h*** did she have her head shoved up her a**<br>  <br>            good luck hope your baby gets better|`|cxMAAoWUaa	Go to the doctor, it is probably nothing but better safe than sorry.<br>  YES tell the boys parents, he needs to learn to keep his hands to himself.  Fire your sitter. I personally will not hire anyone who isn't a mom herself.

XmJZkFuMaa	Personally, I let my daughter still have her binky at night, but in the morning I make her leave it in the crib.  I say "bye bye binky!" and put it in the crib and make her leave it there too, then we walk away.  If she finds one in the daytime, I'll let her have it for a while and then make her put it in the crib again.  She's learned that binkies are for crib, not for the rest of the house.  <br>  <br>  I'm still allowing her to have her binkies, she's 15 months now.  They're orthodontic, she only has them in the crib, and she chews on them more than sucks while she's teething.  It's like a teething relief for her.  I'll take them away when I feel she's ready.  But again, it's not like she's going to the store with her binky, playing outside, or even in her room with the binky.  Binkies stay in the crib, that's the binky rule...|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Just toss them, all of them. If he finds a new one, throw that away too. It'll be harder for you than it will be for him, since he is only 9 months. The first few days will be the hardest, but it'll get better.|`|AA11210211	My son was almost 3 yrs when I took his B away,I just simply took it away,it was there when he went to sleep and gone when he woke up,he never had a problem with this,I did this with his blankey to.My daughter is 1 yr and she still has her B, I don't plan to take it away until she is closer to 2 yrs and again I will just take it away.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	when it comes time, the passy fairy will come and take them to a new baby that needs them more...
rev4lrn0aa	Sounds like your mind is tricking you into thinking you are pregnant. If you had medium bleeding, it was most likely not implantation bleeding as that is usually just very light spotting. Everyone is different though and some women even have "periods" while they are pregnant so you never know! Wait until the day you are supposed to get your period and test again. Good luck!|`|0KGriIC7aa	the same things happened to me last month but no preggers for me. i thought i was but i probally just faked my self out. wait a few more days if no af test again
ttoJ6YyPaa	A crib is definitely a generous gift.  If you can afford it I would say that it will be a huge help for her.  I would suggest to let her pick the one that she likes because she might really want a specific one.  Like the once that come with a drawer attach to it for extra storage.  Or something else like that.  <br>  <br>  To make it even more special I would also recommend naming a star after her or her son.  When I had my daughter my husband did that for me and It just made that day even more special to me.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Wow.  While I'd normally say that she deserves her own present, she'd probably be thrilled with getting a crib from someone.  Just make sure you find out if she's picked out a crib already, don't go picking out one yourself.|`|hrVbxk8Jaa	Absolutely|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i think it is great that you want to buy her a crib, but you reallly need her input, bc she may well have one that she really wants already,,,,gl|`|vLJKNkNLaa	that sounds a bit too indulgent!<br>  Maybe get her a bassonet or small rockingchair. You don't want her to feel like she is a charity case.<br>  trust me..I tried giving my  good friend and brand new mattress and she was furious.

5c187f748a208cc6e83296a593f81025aa	Wow!  A lot of preconceived and judgmental notions flying around here!  Geesh. <br>  <br>  Anyway, if you have already made an adoption plan and he has already signed-over his rights (TPR) than depending on your state I do not *think* you have to tell him when the baby is born.  <br>  <br>  And yes (since someone asked) in SOME states expectant parents can sign TPR before baby is born.  Not saying it is right - just that it is the law.<br>  <br>  This is your child and you can place him or her if you choose to do so.  As for telling the bio dad about labor, that is totally up to you.  You are not legally obligated to do so.  The attorney or adoption agency for the adoptive parents will handle the legal details. I would consult them before listening to anyone here, btw. ;)|`|uhZzEzu0aa	Well the situation is not an easy one so i'm ganna try to help the best i can. I think you should tell the father of your baby when your in labor but ask him not to come until the day after because it sounds like you just don't want to see him at all. If you have to you can ask the hospital to keep him away from you you can say who visit you and who doesn't. I know what your feeling i wasn't to thrilled with my baby's father. You have to try to talk to him to get everything kind of situated before you go into labor though. If adoption is what you really wanna do and if he tries to fight then you could try to take away his rights but that is a hard thing to do unless the judge see's him as a very unfit parent. But not only for yourself but for your abby please talk to the father to make sure adoption is a choice you can both live with because its a life alternating experience|`|zs1C1G1waa	For your child, you should notify the father AND make sure his name is on the birth certificate.  If you don't want to put EVERYONE involved through a possible horrible ordeal, you will do this.  If the father truly wants to parent, don't make him fight for custody.  If you don't want to hurt the potential adoptive parents, don't place a baby with them when the adoption could be contested (rightly) and they, the father, and your child could be put through a horrible tug-of-war ugly situation.  This needs to be done by the books if it is to happen.  An adoption is not ethical if both biological parents aren't completely informed and give consent.  No consent from any biological parent is legal until the child is born.  It sounds like the father will give consent and the two of you are just playing games.  But if he DOES want to parent, that is what should happen.  Anyway, you and the father need to stop playing games.  Others lives are involved, most importantly your unborn child.|`|15e94cdd62390c77d894baf7872415d3aa	You don't have to but it would be the right thing to do. Your right in most states the father has 72 or more hours. I hope the father finds this out to. My son has lived through this hell caused by the birth mother, adoption agency and the couple who has the baby. He sued them and won they settled out of court so now he has plenty of money to fight. He could have sued the mother but he didn't because my son and her has a daughter together that is older.  He could sue you if you hid the fact about the child and shame on you. How would you like knowing that you were going to be a parent and you would lose the child think hard on this.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	I won't get into you being the victim, I strongly disagree there.<br>  However no, you have no legal responsibility to tell the father that you're going into labor.<br>  You do have to make sure he knows about the adoption plans because he has to sign over his parental rights in order for the adoption to be legal.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	I would tell the father now. I don't know how old you are, but he also has to make this decision. He might want to keep the baby in his life and accept all responsibility.  Most likely the father will have full custody of the baby and you would lose all rights. Are you sure your making the right decision? Good luck to you.|`|oWdNHaRGaa	tell him but please don't give up you unborn baby unless your a 100% shaw your doing the right thing, if the couple really want your child go right ahead an do it because it going to make a couple happy. go right ahead an have you baby ,but i hope you get to know your baby. so good luck|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Yes you do, it's his baby too. Are you afraid he might want to keep the baby himself? He has every right to know his child.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	1: Unless you were raped, you are not a "victim".How do you know he was trying to "trap" you? there are plenty of  men out there who think they are fertile.Don't assume anything.You are talking about your child's future.<br>  <br>  #2: How did he falsely obtain his rights? it sounds like you have issues with this man and you need to mature up a little bit.You are not really thinking about this child.This man obviously wants his child.Why would you want to deny your child the right to his/her father and paternal family just because you know of a 2 parent family that wants to adopt your child? that isn't right.<br>  <br>  This doesn't sound right...how did he sign over his rights if the baby isn't even born yet?<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are unable to provide a home for this child, the child must go to his/her father.That is morally correct.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your lawyer better watch his P's and Q's...the father CAN go after the potential adoption parents or even you if you give the kid up and he doesn't get a chance to properly parent HIS child.<br>  <br>  <br>  ps, EGG DONOR, does your husband know of this bastard child?|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Things could get very messy if you don't <br>  <br>  The 'nice couple' could end up in court with a contested adoption if you attempt to by-pass the father's rights.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Yes he should be notified at least after the baby is born. He deserves a fair chance to be part of the baby's life. If he doesn't want it fine but this way he won't be able to seek legal action on you afterwards.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	Tell him now, give him some time to get over the initial shock, and then discuss the babies future together if you can.|`|zLoyo24Taa	You may not need to let him know when you go into labor, but he needs to know when the baby is born.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	Yes you need to notify him. It is up to him to get there or not. If you do not want him in the room, he does not have to be. But he has the right to wait in the waiting room and to see his child after it is born.<br>  <br>  He could not have already signed his rights away, that is not legally possible until after the child is born and legal paternity is established. And if you wanted your child, he could not sign his rights away unless you agreed. He would still be legally responsible for the child and you can still get child support at least. If you share this plan and he denies paternity, the child support agency will provide a test for free. <br>  <br>  I am sorry that you do not want your child and that you want to give it an uncertain life without you. However, the father has the right to have the baby instead of you if you do not want the baby and that is his right. He still has time to change his mind about this and if he does there is nothing you can do about it if you do not want your child. So that is why it is so important to let him know about going into labor. Like I said, he does not need to be in the room but he has a right to wait in the waiting room and to see HIS baby.|`|AA10736763	You do not have to notify the father when you go into labor.  You just need to let him know once the child is born.  You could do it all through your attorney.  If he has already signed some paperwork, then he is on record as the father, and his termination of parental rights will have to be proved up in court before the child is released for adoption.  So relax.  Leave it up to the attorney.  You do not have to talk to him again, if it's that bad.  You are paying the attorney, let him deal with the father.|`|16vwEBiqaa	To clarify...you are worried that if you do not tell him you are in labor that he will change his mind about the adoption. I'm assuming that his has requested that he be there for the birth or you wouldn't be worried about angering him.<br>  <br>  At this point in time he has already signed over his rights. So regardless of the fact that he could revoke them 72 hours later he has no lawful ties to the baby.<br>  <br>  I know you asked the question to get advice...I would advise you to let him know when you go into labor, or at least shortly after birth. Also, ask your lawyer about the 72 hour period...there maybe some "rule" about not telling him when the baby is born b/c what if you told him 80 hours later, he could claim that he was not duly notified.<br>  <br>  If you are asking Yahoo Answers these questions because your lawyer cant, get a new lawyer! :) Try posting the question in "legal/law" section. They may be able to help you better.|`|9gng3p3faa	As an adoptee whose father was never informed I am absolutely disgusted at the thought of someone giving away someone else's kid. Yes, the child is his too. You don't want the kid, fine - but give the child a chance to be raised by one side of his real family. My father would have raised me had he known about me. I deserved to be with my father, my family. All children deserve to be with their family - not someone else's.<br>  <br>  Laws are not always moral and ethical.|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	oh wow....you CANT be serious. <br>  yes you have to tell him....for crying out loud its his kid too. you didnt get pregnant ALONE, so you cant just make all the decisions ALONE. <br>  <br>  i dont care what you say...you may have been lied to but you are a grown woman, its time to take responsibility. you had a say in sleeping with him. <br>  i was 17 when i got pregnant and took more responsibilty than you are. <br>  <br>  you have to tell the father. you are saying you dont want to break the law, but i think you are trying to find legal way to do just that. you are claiming you have been decieved by him-but you are doing just the same. you are no better than him if you dont live up to your responsibility. <br>  <br>  if you wont keep your child...at least give him or her legal and ethically.<br>  you owe that child at least that much.|`|3v9rL5xLaa	It's not your responsibility to make sure he establishes his paternity. He already knows you are pregnant and knows the approximate time of conception, so LEGALLY you are not obligated to inform him when you go into labor or give birth. Everyone elses answers are moral judgements.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Um, YES!  What the heck!  It is his baby too, and he has the right to be informed.  Are you afraid he's going to (gasp!) keep his own baby?  He is entitled to.  This is his child.  If you go about doing illegal things, then it WILL catch up to you.  He could sue you for not telling him.  He has the right to know.  The two of you made this baby, it is not JUST YOUR DECISION on what happens.<br>  <br>  Don't break the law.  Don't be immoral.  This child deserves his/her parents, and if you aren't willing to step up, I hope he does.<br>  <br>  ETA:  It doesn't matter what he said.  You willingly slept with him.  He has the right to know that he has a child coming.  This is STILL his baby.  I don't care how mad he made you.  This baby belongs with a parent, NOT a stranger.  If you do something against the law, you can get in trouble.  Lying and falsifying documents is AGAINST the law.  <br>  Not psycho?  Doesn't sound like that is the case.  This is his child legally, and he has to sign over his rights.  By asking this question, you are leaving a trail of evidence that he can use against you if you decide to deceive the courts.  Do the right thing.  This baby deserves him, if you are going to give up.<br>  <br>  ETA:  The victim is the child.  NOT YOU!<br>  <br>  ETA:  Yes, but this child isn't theirs.  It is yours and the father's first.  You have no interest and are hell bent on giving up.  Maybe he isn't.  He deserves a chance to raise HIS child.  As an adopted person, I know I would be torn to shreds thinking that my first father wanted to keep me, but that my first mother lied so that I'd be given up.  <br>  If you are planning on being lawful, why did you ask if you had to tell him, when you knew that you did?  You are looking for a way out of it, and that is just wrong.<br>  <br>  ETA:  You asked... and I quote  "Do I have to tell the father (of baby I am giving up for adoption) when the baby is born?"  Then saying he has 72 hours after the child is born to let him know.  Sounds like backpeddling.  I think that you know he doesn't have to be there for the birth.  It would be common courtesy to let him know though.|`|frpCK0utaa	yes. He's the father, he should be able to have a say in his childs future. So yea, he needs to know when you go into labor.<br>  <br>  ETA: He doesnt have to be in the delivery room with you if you dont want him there. But, he needs to be informed. you may think he doesnt deserve rights, but regardless he has them.<br>  <br>  ETA2: what happened to your 19 month old daughter you mentioned in a previous question? and you were married two weeks ago, that divorce went through fast.

You don't wait for help from your husband, you ask for it and get it.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Oh my! I am a SAHM who works from home too...for a start you need to eat dinner with everyone else! Why can't you sit the baby in her high chair (I do with mine) and make the 4 year old and your husband sit with you ...all together and eat like that? ALso cut WAY back on your chores...I don;t iron ANYTHING at all...I would rather be sane and have creased jeans...if my husband wants an ironed shirt then he must do it himself...I am not his Mother. If he is in a big hurry then of course I will help but I expect the same in return. Let the housework slide a bit...an older lady once told me this..."The children won't remember if you ironed their pajamas but they will remember if you were not too tired to have a picnic in the Garden with them"|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i dont get this from any1 except for my jerk bf. he thinks i have it "so easy" bc i "get" to stay at home and take care of our baby (we both agreed til shes older, daycare is out of the question, too many bad things could happen) i know how you feel, hang in there. maybe those ppl are just jealous.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I don't get treated that way.....I do think he thinks that I have it easier than I do but then he gets home for the weekend and realized what goes on in the day. Leave all the chores to be done and the kids to be watched by him for one day and he will be in your corner in no time and thanking God he works outside the home!|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	give him what he wants...trade him for a day,  take a day for yourself, get out and do what you want, bet hes screaming for you to take back over by the time you get back, leave a  guide as to what needs done throughout the day,,,or let him know what isnt done when you get back, pick his day apart, make sure he KNOWS how it feels.|`|fHjSonssaa	I agree with the first poster.<br>  <br>  Trade jobs with him for a day.  Better yet- a couple days in a row, so he doesn' t get cocky say- ahhh that was nothing.<br>  <br>  I have the EXACT same "issue" with my partner- only it's not just in friendly conversation that he says he wants to trade places.  It ocassioanlly turns into this ridiculous argument about how he works- so WHY would I ask him to take of our son while I go wash the bottles when he gets home from work?  He loves our son, don't get me wrong- but he's a very active 11 month old kid who is a little attention monger (maybe our faults- so I'm not blaming our little boy)- but it is what it is right now.<br>  <br>  Also, we have one car, which I need during the day to do errands and such- do I also have to get up and take him to work and pick him up each day.  There is no public transportation from where we live to his work, and no one lives remotely near us for carpooling.<br>  <br>  And according to him I watch TV and sip champagne all day.<br>  HA!!<br>  <br>  I don't know what else to do except keep talking to him.  Even when I've left our son with him for a few hours- not even a whole day- and the little one was having a bad day and my partner is SO relieved that I am home- HE STILL doesn't give me credit even though he's practically at the door waiting to hand him over.  (OK...not really, but you get the point)   =)<br>  <br>  I have not found a "solution" to this problem yet- so I just keep instilling it in his brain that I am a SOLID contributor in this household- and how could he forget that.  And then some days, I think he does get it.  I swear men are so moody!!<br>  <br>  I feel for ya---|`|TSsT8QGgaa	i have never felt that way,,but i was blessed with a husband that carries his own weight.|`|758cDKEFaa	yeah i do, my partner seems to think looking after a very active toddler is a piece of cake while hes busy all day!<br>  i tell him all the time how hard it is and i doubt he could do what i do everyday but he doesnt seem to listen!<br>  i think it would be worth telling your pertner exactly what you've just told us then he might just think twice before he opens his mouth.|`|AXEqOEloaa	I am a SAHM and do just as much as you, I even work part time from home. My husband tells me I have the most important job and that is running our household and raising our children. People that cannot or will not stay home to raise their own children really do not know what goes on. You are very lucky to be home with your babies and yes it is a tough job but do not let anyone stress you out because they are just ignorant and do not understand. It sounds to me that you deserve a raise and I will tell you that I think you are great!<br>  <br>  I was a radiographer for many years before my sons came along, it was tough adjusting to one less income but we made it work, and I would never ever trade places with anyone the has to go work for someone else.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	At least you have your kids. I'm home alone with our dogs. My 3 kids are old enough to attend school. I find myself cleaning their rooms sometimes, which I should because they clean their own room when they come home.  The whole idea of me quiting my job was to be here with them over the summer. And I feel exactly the way you do. Except you have a lot more going for you. You should be proud of yourself. I bet your a very organized person. I'm trying to find a job now, but it's been tough. I find myself tired more than I was before because my children and husband expect me to know where everything is at and if I got things done. I also think I've gained more weight. I clean so fast and so use to my routine that I will have nothing to do. I have to think of other things to do around the house.  I feel somewhat good, but I don't feel so worthy, so I know exactly what you mean. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NI0cNU22aa	Actually, I have a good friend who did exactly what the first answer suggested... she left a list of everything she had to do that day for her husband to do, and she went to the spa. When she got home, the house was messy, the kids were hungry, and there were 17 messages on the answering machine. He never said anything again.|`|TXddP0uxaa	No, I don't get this kind of treatment.  Your fiance seems like a selfish spoiled child.  Since speaking to him like a rational adult doesn't seem to work, then (as my husband just suggested) you should go on strike.  For a week do absolutely nothing that doesn't directly involve taking care of your child.  Don't do his laundry, cook his dinner, or clean anything. Perhaps seeing what isn't getting done will be more illustrative to him than coming home to a beautiful house every day.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, you are over committed and the stress of all that can't help things.  I can't imagine how you have time to homeschool your sister and care for your other kids while also doing several sideline jobs.  It is time to start telling people NO.  Being a stay at home mom means you STAY AT HOME and care for your own children, not schlep them all over town running other people's errands all day.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Lucky for me I have a husband who understands that what I do as a stay at home mom is hard work. The next time that he says that to you tell him ok then I'll go find a job and you can take care of EVERYTHING that I do every day. Give him the list of things that you have to do every day and then a list of things that you have to do that week (dr appt etc..) then see what he says.|`|8LhEs3WLaa	my husband used to say the same thing so he reduced his work hours to casual so I could work. Only then did he realise exactly what I did all day. You have the most important job you will ever have. You have the responsibility of giving you children a hands on mum. No job in the world compares to being a good mother. Try this: for 1 week write down every job you do with the times. do this as you complete each task. If after doing this this your hubby reads it and is still not convinced, I would consider trading him in. It is not important whether he feels you are doing enough, the people that will thank you are your children. I'm sorry but in my opinion men come and go, but your children are people you will want a good relationship with forever.|`|AA12227599	What an *** he is then. Here's an idea. Why don't you switch places with him and see how he likes it then. You take his ONE job, and he can have all of yours. e.g Laundry, cooking, cleaning, shopping, listening, disciplining, budgeting, appointment scheduler, taxi driver, helping with homework, keeping the kids safe, answering phones, birthday parties, vacation planner, and the list goes on, and on, and on, and on. Men have absolutely no concept of what it takes to run a home. The ones that think we just sit on our asses all day and do nothing ought to try it some time. I guarantee you that he would never degrade you again. Or better yet, make him happy and go find a job and let him pay the daycare costs. <br>  Do not let him demean you like that. You are working 50 times harder than him, and your job is 24/7, unlike him who gets to leave at the end of the day. He's a jerk, and you're soooooooo much better than him he can't stand it, so he has to insult you.<br>  Just keep up the good work. He may disappear, but your children will always be there, and they will appreciate your sacrifices, and how beneficial having a mom at home was for them.|`|FJTLu88Naa	hun you are doing a great job my hats off to you for being the woman you are..yes we men tend to not show appreciation for the things you ladies do for us and the family and let me say we do and from what your saying i want to tell you that you are a great woman and dont ever feel down cuz they love you and need you..
KcDRAWrtaa	try to think of any other symptoms you have. ANY. even the ones that seem weird because these could be clues to a condition you could have. if you have no other symptoms. it could be because you're watching tv right before you go to sleep, and your brain is still so wired. and your eyes are used to the bright lights flickering.<br>  <br>  hope this helped!|`|Ym1vJtXfaa	HOT SHOWER<br>  WARM MILK<br>  SLEEPYTIME TEA<br>  MELATONIN<br>  <br>  IN THAT ORDER!!!|`|dkjAUCxCaa	Just drink 1 glass of milk it depends what size is your glass|`|73W7ReR9aa	clonazepam or xanax from your doctor.

I will try to help you I took child development in the 10th grade. That was 5 yrs ago so don't completely beat me over the head if I get one wrong.. LOL here it goes...  1. The first sign Daphne is pregnant is a missed period, other signs would be frequent urination, cramping, and fatigue.  2. The evidences would be dark areolas (or the area around the nipples).  3. The principle behind the positive pregnancy test would be because the test detects the hcg in the urine to determine if the woman is pregnant or not.  4. This question is actually worded a little weird I am not sure of the exact question cause its a lot like question 1.  5. Eat alot of fiber, fruits and vegetables. As well as drink plenty of milk and try to eat a little of each food group.  6. If this is the patients first check up and everything went well I would ask her to return in 4 weeks for a follow up.  LOL hope this sord of helps...|`|YpqhAHAKaa	...sounds like a bleeped up math problem...if you have that many questions, please see an OBGYN.  ugghhh...plus means your pregnant.

d148ce91fb5b35113dd06adfd1bf688faa	Your obsession over food and your weight as well as the fact that you have been trying to throw up indicates that you have an eating disorder.  You really need help dealing with this before your health suffers.  It would be very hard to do by yourself.  Talk to your parents and/or your school nurse for a referral.  Don't be afraid.|`|dqvZmj22aa	It's easy.    Become a vegetarian.  Ever see a fat rabbit?

OU9xnW86aa	The green tea and passion tea are decaf iced tea options. If you are looking for a decaf iced black tea, they do no have that. You could ask them to steep hot black tea and pour it over ice.<br>  <br>  **EDIT: Yes, Starbucks DOES have iced black tea, I stated that. But they do NOT have DECAF iced black tea.**|`|IFqY2w1Paa	The first answer completely beats my answer, but I found this caffeine-free alternative: the Vanilla Rooibos Tazo Tea. Sounds delicious to me. I need to try it. =) I'm 38 weeks pregnant, and I plan on breastfeeding, so anything caffeine-free I can get from Starbucks is worth a try. I've been craving a mocha frappuccino like no other.|`|k5lfyMgNaa	Actually Starbucks does have iced black tea . . . along with passion and green tea.  <br>  <br>  And the Vanilla Rooibus is pretty good. I would reccommend it to anyone looking for a decaf tea option. You can get it with non-fat milk too. It's actually a tea latte with the tea steeped in a bit of hot water sweeted with classic syrup and with steamed milk.
bmoCpcdraa	you seem normal, i had 4 children and never more then 1 ultrasound, when you become 8 mo,s they may see you each week , but no they don't examing you each time , if the baby's heart beat is fine and it is gaining weight ,then no problem, i hope i helped|`|K2jT1z5jaa	The cervix should be closed darling. But they wont check the cervix until approx 36 weeks check up. Some until 38 weeks. <br>  Depends on the doctor. if you would like them to check you can ask them. <br>  You should be entitled to 2 ultrasounds. But you should ask them. There is the 18 - 22 w ultrasound which checks everything and if nothing is odd or different then they wont need to have another one. They will tell you if needed.<br>  <br>  They should be checking your blood pressure, weight, heartbeat, checking your fundal height, Checking how swollen if swollen hands and feet. Asking you about babies movements. & the urine sample is good to always be done.<br>  <br>  At 32 weeks. they should start seeing you every 2 weeks & at 34 weeks every week. but they will tell you. doctors are different on how they want to see you.But in the last months definitely one - 2 weeks.<br>  You arent wasting gas darling. its to make sure that everything is okay and you are feeling okay. Also they should be doing the glucose test for you and blood test at 36 weeks aswel.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|NPmRmnG6aa	After your next appointment you should start going twice a month and the visits will be more indepth.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Sounds normal to me. My doctor only gave one ultrasound unless something was wrong (I ended up getting an emergency ultrasound at 39 weeks). Also, most doctors won't check your cervix unless something seems wrong, or you are around 38-39 weeks.<br>  Your doctor should have explained everything to you and how many ultrasounds you would be getting at the beginning.|`|zcSAWWCkaa	nope thats all they do. i got my first ultrasound at 20wks and my last at 36wks. they wont start checking you until about 36 or 37wks when you have to start going every week.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	calm down u have 12 weeks to go.. they will do that early only if u complain of pain in ur stomache.. they will start doing that around 35 weeks<br>  <br>   idk but i get an ultra sound every time i go but i am high risk
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Sorry, but we cant tell you either.<br>  The doc will be able to though.  You should be able to tell on a blood test by now.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's a little early to tell honestly. The only way you'd get a positive at your doctors is doing a blood test, maybe, but it still may be too early. Most women don't get positives this early.|`|plI0WOrUaa	Any time you miss your pill there is a good chance you could get pregnant.  These pills are hormones that don't stay in your system unless you take them daily.  If you miss a pill, the hormone is out of your system.  That's why you have to take one every day.  You will have to wait it out.|`|973GEZrZaa	u wudnt feel nausea so soon..<br>  <br>  i didnt get mine til at least 4 weeks.<br>  <br>  if im right u wud be around 10 days pregnant, i dont think itd even show up on a test yet? :S.|`|9VL66Ohvaa	maybe<br>  oooh let us know
CVdcrY3kaa	She's doing just fine, perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  If your baby is in the 50% (which seems to be your average) it means that your baby is 50% bigger then other babies and 50% smaller then some....so, smack dab in the middle. Perfectly normal.

Depending on the heaviness and how long it lasted i think you should compare it to implantation bleeding and see if this occured. As this can be a sign of conception. But its possible that it was early. since you have no started and it is due. and you took the test 1 week ago. im pretty sure it was too early and your levels were most likely not high enough for the pregnancy test to detect.<br>  <br>  Stress can definitely delay a period. it can cause irregularity, odd period, lighter, delay for a few days or even miss it.<br>  <br>  Wait a few more days and test it should come up. <br>  If still neg and no period.

TE7foNwMaa	Rylee Grace -- Rylee's a bit popular... number 36 for 2008. And Grace is considered "filler"... this is just a warning, I do LOVE the meaning of Grace... but I personally wouldn't use it because it's a bit mainstream... I do like Rylee, but it's another one that I wouldn't use because of the popularity. I do LOVE the sound of it though, and I think it's a great name. 6 / 10<br>  <br>  Some alternate suggestions are...<br>  Ryler<br>  Rylin<br>  Rinlee<br>  Rilian (rhymes with Jillian. It was the name of a character in the Chronicles of Narnia)<br>  <br>  <br>  Ava May -- I adore Ava...but it's the number 1 most popular name... It's extremely sad, in my opinion. I love the name, and it was after a relative of mine, but I can't push myself to use it while it's so extremely popular. I still consider as a middle name, though. May is also considered "filler", though not quite as much as Grace. I do like it. I've considered using it spelled "Mae", after the band called Mae... Overall, I really do love Ava, but the popularity is pretty intense, if that's something that's important to you. 7 / 10<br>  <br>  Suggestions are...<br>  Eva<br>  Avigail (AH-vih-gayl, it was the original form of Abigail)<br>  Aveen (can be pronounced uh-VEEN or av-EEN or ay-VEEN)<br>  Avalene (can be pronounce AY-vuh-leen or AH-vuh-leen)<br>  <br>  Ashlee Faith -- Faith is, once again, considered "filler"... sorry, I hope I'm not coming across as mean, I just want to make sure that you're educated on the filler middle names, in case that's something you're concerned about. Ashlee is pretty, but it's lost most of its style because of its past popularity... It's a bit overused in older days, and it's not really my favorite. It's pretty, but not my personal favorite. 5 / 10<br>  <br>  Some suggestions are...<br>  Ashien (ash-ee-en)<br>  Ashlynn<br>  Aislin (ayz-lin, my 2 year old neighbor's name)<br>  Asha<br>  Ashby<br>  Ashleen (I have a friend with this name)<br>  Ashtynne<br>   <br>  <br>  Addyson Lynne -- Addyson is the 14th most popular girls' name of 2008... I've never been a fan of the Madison / Addison trend. So it's really not a name that I like. That's my own personal opinion though, and I'm fine with anyone other than myself naming their own daughter either of these names. They're both just not names that I would use. Lynne will always be mispronounced as the normal Lyn / Lynn. You could tray changing the spelling, such as Lynae / Lynnae. My aunt also has this as a middle name. She spells it Lynee, which is similar.  I also like Linnea (a name of one of my friends...she actually has a sister named Sigrid), which is pronounced "lin-AY-uh". 6 / 10 <br>  <br>  Some suggestions...<br>  Adelie (can be pronounced uh-DAY-lee or AD-uh-lee<br>  Ada / Adabelle / Adabella (AY-duh, etc)<br>  Adair / Adaira <br>  Adelia (uh-DAY-lee-uh or uh-DELL-ee-uh<br>  Adamine (AD-uh-min or ad-uh-MEEN)<br>  Addelyn<br>  Adelle (uh-DELL or ad-ELL)<br>  <br>  <br>  Micah Noel -- I'm not sure if Noel is one of the international versions of Noelle, but spelled that way makes the name as a whole look oddly masculine. I prefer Micah for a girl, because of girls that I've known, but with Noel spelled that way, it makes it rather unclear gender wise... Once again, just a warning. I really like both of the names, though, especially Micah. 8 / 10<br>  <br>  Suggestions...<br>  Meica (MAY-kuh or MEE-kuh)<br>  Becca<br>  Alica (AL-ih-cuh)<br>  Danica<br>  Demika (dem-EE-kuh)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I like Ashlee, because it's my name.

I really like Addison, but I'm not sure it flows as well since both the first and last names end in son. Ashlee Faith would be my second choice, very pretty name. Rylee Grace is also a nice name and Micah to me is more masculine, but it could work. Great names and have a safe delivery in May!|`|E6XuKnwqaa	My order of your names would be;;<br>  1.Ashlee Faith- Soo cute?!!

6eaWRGaqaa	I'm not gonna lie, your actually like pretty hot! 8.5/10<br>  <br>  Usually I don't think Asians are as hot (not being racists, just being honest), but I guess I'm a bit of a hypocrite because I'm 1/8th Asian and I think I'm hot stuff (totally joking about the hot stuff part, but I am part Asian).<br>  <br>  Anyway, I like your hair :) I think it'd be hotter more messy though! Don't grow it like out any like longer! It's like perfect!<br>  <br>  GOSHDARNIT! Ergh. I was trying to give up the word "like" for lent (as an interjection), but I guess that isn't working out to well, now is it?<br>  <br>  -Catherine|`|5tqh0akYaa	You look like 12 or 13 lol. and you look very angry..um your okay looking maybe try and do something else with your hair|`|kRaVa0Wraa	YOURE ADORABLE.<br>  <br>  i think you look a bit young, but in a few years youll be cute!|`|pzgPsne9aa	You look pretty young.<br>  Maybe grow your hair longer.|`|Inc78M0Raa	6/10.

Oh yea about your question IDK I think U look fine the way U are. :D|`|vLJKNkNLaa	maybe gain some muscle|`|aDQgLEbuaa	You look pretty young.  13 or 14..you're fine the way you are.  <br>  Btw, I think we have the same camera.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Aww I like it better when you smile.  And I still think we have the same camera.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	I think your cute!  Very young looking though.  I agree with #2 you would look better with the whole "bed head" look, but if you use gel you don't want it to be noticeable:)|`|LhEoVly0aa	you look ok how you are, you're cute, you just need to smile, i think you would have a cheeky smile!|`|iNtPA7X9aa	you look pretty young, so wait till your older before you start to do anything. now I see no need for a change.|`|t0c9sfEkaa	7 and gel|`|GbNtTDxraa	hair gel would be nice|`|OK5OEL1paa	not to shaby , need longer hair , muscles and well yeah....|`|FRW8bReQaa	ok this might sound mean but im giving you an honest opinion<br>  <br>  overall 6/10<br>  <br>  smile more then maybe 7/10<br>  <br>  grow your hair and style it more with wax, gel, etc that could get you and 8/10<br>  <br>  im not going to give you fashion advice because i feel that it should reflect who you think you are, try bright clothes, stay away from boring Grey's, beige's especially black. maybe some nice trendy jeans?? cardigan|`|y3cp05Pgaa	Hey you should have smiled or posed! lol you look fine i, if you want to change yourself grow your hair just a little longer and spike it not to much and just right and you should look cuter.<3 though you are young so you probably need time to grow. really you look fine so don't listen to people. believe me you will look even better with a smile on your face and a great personality.|`|KcDRAWrtaa	you should try to grow you hair out a bit longer. and just play around with it. make it the "bed head" look.<br>  <br>  other than that, i see no need for a change.|`|LY8oJfnoaa	Asian hair usually needs a little bit more volume so I suggest getting a nutrient rich shampoo. Other than that, I would say you look pretty cute. I would date you. Nice smile!<br>  <br>  Sophia : )|`|TSukcJkVaa	start bulking up and working out and get a good hairstyle,  but don't wax your eyebrows ( don't forget to use styling gel on your hair)|`|5VXm2Cc8aa	you are cute let your hair grow a little more and keep towards your face dont have premeditated hair style play with it and youll find a style to fit|`|HUsv9VU9aa	I think you should let your hair grow more. And you should wear some cool sunglasses. <br>  <br>  Your a 8 for me.|`|lLIBmnrfaa	Grow out your hair not to long though.|`|hUtftU2Vaa	u look like a baby asian who hasent turned 12
7rKUmK0qaa	not bad as long as you try to exercise a little a day and you balance everything.. <br>  The key is moderation.. You can eat anything as long as its not too much.|`|DfAb1X3Uaa	i don't see a really big cow on your list,<br>  so i guess your fine! lol jk<br>  well all your items are a bunch of small snacks so its not really a big deal<br>  something a teenager could eat after school|`|52U22fiAaa	Skinny Cow... YUMMM those are the best.  <br>  <br>  I bought pop tarts yesterday, and I haven't eaten those since I was in school a decade ago! lol... pregnancy craves what it craves =P|`|OlXhEVNEaa	im not a lady and im definantly not pregnant but i can eat a whole jar of miracle whip.....but i doubt pop corn is good for babies...slow down on it..|`|RjdrO7DVaa	100 calorie snack packs are really bad for you.  They have soo many preservatives that you and your baby don't need.  <br>  <br>  Until I found out that I need to do a 3 hr glucose test, I would eat fruit like crazy, chicken, pasta, banana bread, bagels, chocolate, & mac and cheese|`|uGqYoZNEaa	These sound like really good snack foods!  I was expecting to hear whoppers, big macs, large pizzas to yourself!<br>  <br>  Iam only 7 weeks and I eat whatever I want already.  It helps my nauser.  So if I want fish sticks with mayonnaise at 1 am, then that's what I"m eating.|`|zBz10IiOaa	no i do as well my diet goes like this<br>  <br>  pop tarts for breakfest<br>  dorritos <br>  hot pocket<br>  lean pocket <br>  salad<br>  yougert<br>  then cereal<br>  <br>  don't feel bad hun your not a cow your pregnant just like all of us<br>  i am 6 months i have only gained 10lbs if that :)|`|h3WLRshSaa	i eat that and im not pregnant! hahaha!|`|uklVm81uaa	being preggos tends to do that to people. I suggest trying out some healthier food and more variety.|`|3HNWZBxMaa	o yea <br>  i eat like a bull :/|`|GLAszp03aa	I;m 28 weeks pregnant, and I have had the same problem.  My heartburn and constant bloating went away, so every hour or  so, I am dying for something to snack on.  It's completely normal.  A craving is your body's way of telling you that it needs something.  When you're pregnant, you may not feel hungry in your stomach, but you still wanna eat.  Chances are you ARE hungry, but the pressure and hormones keep you from feeling it in your stomach.  Fetuses consume 3/4 of what you eat, so you're definitely not eating too much.  Listen to your body. If you wanna eat, eat.  Lol.  Hope that helped.|`|WYk0zYdhaa	I'm at the 21st week today with our second and man!  After the nausea went away (for the most part) I can't get enough food!  In the morning I have many breakfasts like second breakfast like a hobbit lol.  It really seems like I haven't eaten anything at all lol.  Then am hungry again before the lunch hour ugh!  I try to eat healthy like celery and peanutbutter, now that i can stand it salad, things like that but since Valentine's day and since its still around I've been eating chocolate.  Not too much but like two pieces a day.  Pretty much I eat what sounds good and is quick to grab since it seems like when hunger strikes I NEED TO EAT NOW!  As for cravings....been on a coffee kick and don't want to do caffiene or fake sugar since it's all chemicals and Splenda gives me cramps.  So I get the caffiene free international coffee (yeah the instant stuff) that seems to satisfy that. Lately though it's been salad spring mix with some sunflower seeds and my favorite vinergatte (which sounds like the bomb even now) .<br>    I'm telling you though, up until my head hits the pillow I'm eating and snacking lol.  I would love to have ice-cream and milk shakes but alas am lactose intollerant?  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you are getting a good mix in and as long as you are not gaining too much (because believe me the doc will tell you lol) it should be all good!  You probably are making up for when you had heartburn.  It won't last because as your baby gets bigger there will be less room for anything!  When you get closer to your due date I doubt you will feel such an insatiable appitite lol... no worries.<br>  <br>  Blessings and best of luck.|`|4jW9rERFaa	I am 21 weeks. With the worst heartburn in the world! Damn I am so jealous of those who don't have it. I have frequent cravings for the following:<br>  <br>  Ice Cream (especially Coldstone)<br>  Olive Gardens' salad<br>  Spaghetti<br>  100 Grand Bars-- YUM!<br>  Starbursts<br>  Pickles<br>  Chinese food<br>  <br>  I think thats about it at this time. Last time i was pregnant I decided it would be a good idea to eat a peanut butter toast sandwich with egg and banana. Oh god I still regret that thought. haha. It sounds like you are eating healthy. All the things you eat are not bad for you. I also eat at midnight. I hate that. Sometime I even wake up to eat at midnight. Err..|`|IFqY2w1Paa	Don't worry! It will change after your have your baby. =) You're eating mostly healthy, low calorie snacks, too, so you have nothing to worry about. I, on the other hand, crave KFC and Dr. Pepper. I wish I craved less fattening food choices. =P<br>  <br>  Keep munching on apples and chicken! =) You need the protein and vitamins for the baby and yourself.
hlWdFTcjaa	When your sister is ready she will confide in you. She may just need some time to adjust to the very big decision she has just made. Just make her aware that you are there for her and she will eventually open up to you. Good luck hun!|`|yrF1q1mdaa	give her some time then try to talk to her, she'll probably be more open to it|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	You're sister just did one of the hardest things she'll ever have to do in her life. She's bound to be upset and confused, and she may have been worried that you'd judge her. She probably had second thoughts herself, and couldn't deal with criticism so soon. Giver her some time. Just be there for her as best you can (without mentioning it to her) and show her that you care. She'll open up to you when she feels ready to.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Just because she's your sister doesn't mean she has to tell you everything. Stop being selfish this isn't about YOU she just went through something extremely difficult. She will talk about it if she wants to/ when she's ready.
sEihaeLNaa	i think about the name i am going to name my baby girl but its gonna be aliana marie|`|AA10325228	I don't like it... sorry|`|Kru3PZbkaa	A woody vine (look it up in the dictionary)|`|W0hNoMSsaa	I think of a tropical vine, because that's what liana means.|`|pCbzhOrkaa	The pretty sophomore. I like it, Layla is also beautiful|`|bGLAIBLcaa	Um nothing really just sounds like a normal girls name thats all :)|`|MyUx7Bp0aa	Fruit, I have no idea why. I hate the name by the way. It sounds too boring.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Stripper. sorry|`|c34ff1f2d66a580bdbc491850122d151aa	i like it
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Yes you can be.<br>  However, if you have started birth control, you would not be any more likely to get pregnant than someone who had not just recently had a baby.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	It is definitely possible, and likely, to get pregnant right after giving birth. My cousin got pregnant 5 weeks after having her daughter. Take a test and see if it comes backs positive. You'll have your answer then. Baby dust to you!|`|14e456d5e53990f259a86e7b6534ca2eaa	hell yeah! you better take a test. new mothers get pregnant easily after birth|`|os1ydh2daa	oh yeah honey! thats when your most firtle!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yes it is. Breastfeeding is not birth control. You still usually ovualte while breastfeeding. Take a test hun.
x647LeB2aa	Bah!    My sister-in-law had a lot of problems conceiving.  Three failed IVF's, two miscarriages and 15 years later she had twins.  She couldn't decide what to call them for SIX weeks and only settled on the names she did then because she had to register them that day!    You'd have thought the 'what should be call our children' discussion might have happened at some point during all that time!|`|8f5998255b222a165d2045a05453b46faa	past 2 days is long overdue. Nickname fine but its real name is usually always in the back of the mothers mind for those 8 to 9 months. |`|tuR1Wl6Uaa	We didnt name our daughter until she was 3 weeks old, Everyone thought it was really weird and tried pushing us to choose a name, Which we wouldnt do. We thought we was having a boy and didnt really think of girls names, I was so exhausted that i couldnt settle on a name and i didnt want to look back and regret the name i picked for her, so we waited until we was 100% which i admit did take a while because everything i liked he didnt and vice versa.   Im glad we didnt name her straight away, She gained a lovely little nickname which i called her before she was named properly.    Anyways to answer your question, I would start to think its weird after a month, I think its after 2 months that you are forced to name the child, they also fine you after 2 months. |`|AA11308841	i waited 3 weeks till i decided|`|54ZI8grBaa	Who is shouting at you?  You asked a question and people are answering.    I'd say that you should have a name before you leave the hospital.|`|osDQVLqNaa	Our daughter was called something completely different for the first two days of her life (not officially, luckily we didn't put it on any paperwork)! We'd sort of decided on a name, but then someone close to the family called their daughter that three weeks before ours was born, so we picked another name - that really didn't suit her at all and we changed it! 38 weeks pregnant now with another little girl, and I have a few ideas but I don't know what she'll look like, or how she'll act, so how can I name her?    I think a couple of weeks would be as long as I could leave the decision before just picking a name out of a hat, or asking our family to choose!|`|AyWWItGpaa	I think it should be decided within the first couple of hours - when you're pregnant you tend to pick out definate names beforehand or pick out a few names and see which suits baby best . I chose my sons name before he was born x|`|isRVd0Efaa	30 years|`|6y5JIm0kaa	like after a month  the kid needs an identity|`|OkFqA0qQaa	A week or so... Babies develop a few more features and looks within the first couple of days, so you'd know :)|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	hehe , Megatron! Awesome. Um, I think it's just up to an individual.  I was convinced my daughter was a boy..and had a boy's name picked out. I did have 2 girls names just in case..Tara Marie and Jenna Elise..but I didn't know which I wanted & was positive , lol that she was  a boy. She had complications, so they took her away and I didn't get to really hold her til about 4 hours after the delivery. And by then, after having been in labor 3 days,they made me give her back and sleep...so it was 8-10 hours after her delivery that I really settled in with her and decided she was Tara.   I think if you aren't sure, you should wait. I mean , as long as you get it before they start school, right ;-) ? Megatron, hehe.|`|kzkrll3Xaa	thirty years|`|SVCtlCzBaa	About a week or two..maybe up to a month|`|QzWHMGHJaa	24 hrs!|`|6k5fhFyBaa	More than 24 hours. I'd plan to have the name picked before-hand, why would you wait?? How would you feel to know you were nameless for days and referred to as Baby  442 lol|`|DmKH9ZaRaa	My sister took 3 weeks to decide her son`s name ....  I knew my son`s name when I was 7 ... I informed my husband on our first ever date what I was calling our first son ....and there would be no negotiation  ... LOL     EDIT; His name is Callum ..it was one of the vets in All Creatures Great and Small .. I was besotted with that programme !|`|hrMhhB4Saa	the first second|`|dwdLkvgPaa	it took us a day and half to finally make up our minds with our second baby ...with our first we knew the minute we found out if she was a boy or a girl|`|35945512fbc551d838d93d04aad5f789aa	I would think that if it isn't chosen before the baby is born, it would be weird for the baby to not have a name after the day it is born, at least.|`|AA12074640	The hospital wants to know RIGHT NOW so they won't get behind in their record-keeping.    Some will pressure you relentlessly until you give them the name.|`|HovV5fA9aa	I would think a couple of days, get some baby names books.   You cant call your baby 'it' for long.|`|3Eixj6Syaa	2 days.    a week if you're really pushing it.|`|NhCHmOfMaa	before the birth wtf are u a dog?|`|cb5c699472c5114ed99da5404a38ca3faa	You have at least 8-7 months before baby get here, so I say that's about enough time to make up your mind!|`|zKN5cuShaa	I'd say about a 3 weeks..!! |`|isokr9cfaa	two days|`|2n0B4cY6aa	id say the first 24 hours|`|uUGSLs9Daa	bout 3 days|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	I would expect after the first 48 hours it would have a name.|`|7PHvaUy8aa	2-3 days Max.     What would you say to the baby? Hello, you? I love you, (blank).? How would you introduce people "here is our nameless baby..."    Although, maybe I am weird, I talk to my newborns....|`|ixzT5y1gaa	Id say after leaving the hospital....come on, youve had 9 months to pick one!! haha|`|5c5946efed27cde334f89e03e46e319faa	legally you have six weeks- i decided on my son's name about 4 months before he was born|`|kRqm2X2Baa	I would say 2-3 days. Around the time you would be leaving the hospital. I just remembered the old show Mad About You and how it took them forever to find a name for the new baby

Good luck!!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I think you probably have another week to two weeks left, so around 38weeks  Good luck!|`|WaU0hmD5aa	really when he's ready but if i have to guess i will say in another week or two and may God bless you|`|Wps4XuqHaa	Ok i think your baby will be born feb 13th :) x|`|uTEr67Bhaa	I say a week or two.

mY19PPlIaa	Green fluids sound like infection. I dont think he will open you up again put just give you some ointment or maybe some kind of antibiotics.|`|WaU0hmD5aa	i don't know what they are going to do but you ned to go let them look at it and see what is going on and God bless you|`|tuIG5Gwaaa	most likely they will just give you antibiotics, the longer you wait the worse it will get. Be strong! I know u can do it cause you were very brave to have a baby!|`|hnKRu0jwaa	I have had two myself. I'd say it has opened and that's what causing the bleeding. Have you had you 6wks check up? If not I would go n early and have it looked at cause it can easily get infected.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	First all you have been picking up heavy things..or doing something to stress you belly. But you need to see the doc for sure. I really think you are healing but are doing to much to your body. I told you that one other time... dont pick up nothing heavier than a tea cup.Just go see what is going on.You havent let your body heal properly.. Good luck girl..
ZrIl3PwLaa	any exercise is good for loosing weight, you have a personal trainer talk to them about what is best for your body.    Just eat healthy no junk food or high fat foods, eat more fruits veggies & protiens cut out sodas, chocolate, candy fast food and any sport you decide or even walking and you will see weight loss. Dance is a great way to loose weight but it is also very tough on the body especially starting out a little over weight. I really suggest walking maybe start with a mile a day and then gradually increase that and then from there increase it to a jog of a mile or two per day & then on to running.    Good luck & STAY HEALTHY!!!!|`|PExOJJLgaa	dance just sculpts your body and gets you toned. I suggest something like soccer, swimming, etc.  Maybe you can take both though.  The best thing to do while being involved in a sport is eating healthy!  make sure you never skip meals and avoid things you know you shouldn't.      Good luck.|`|jsCjGUPuaa	yea they are good but if u want to get weight off fast than u need to do more activity and have a proper diet. i would just start to walk or run or u could play field hockey which is fun and u dont really even notice how much your doing (until afterwards of course) and field hockey goes on all year long because there is indoor field hockey       Hope i Helped :)|`|R0YkIVlpaa	try aerobics|`|jKhDwtVfaa	Dance is very good even if you can't dance you can still enjoy it. You can do it with your mates at your house, just put some music on and dance away, be silly or serious its up to you. Just remember to have fun!   A good sport is swimming, you use almost every muscle in your body, so it's a good overall workout.  Good luck|`|AUK3lzEbaa	Anything that invovles lots of jumping!  Good luck! Lose those lovehandles babe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|UxMugqdraa	Take aerobic dance. My teacher makes us run, do push ups, sits ups, and a whole lot more! Surprisingly I gained weight but loss inches off my waist. It hurts but no pain no gain.|`|eKaGmMzTaa	No I dont think your unhealthy and I dont see you as being too overweight. I would recomend joining a swimming class. It would be hard to get into a team but a swimming class or private swimming lessons is perfect. You could go as many times as you want and swimming is very good for losing weight. Tae kwon do or karate is not the best choice if you want to lose weight. Maybe join 2 different things. Dance class is perfect! And swimming is another Perfect choice!    P.S: IF your that self concious, rather than going to a swimming class with people, you could go every day or w/e days you want to the YMCA and go for a free swim. You could do as many laps and theres hardly any people during the time of free swim because no classes are happening. I take swimming and I'm proud to say Im very fit. I know I shouldn't really be talking since I'm naturally thin and I know it's hard to lose weight. BUT I've seen people who are overweight come regulary to the Y and I definitely see a difference after a month or two. Definitely Try Swimming!    I hope I helped and most importantly good luck :)|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	Well, I went from completely inactive to extremely active. Since I don't have enough self-discipline to make myself exercise, I joined sports. I tried cross country. That is sooo hardcore. I lost some weight and then gained some (lost fat, gained muscle). It got me into good shape and I wanted to keep it up, so I joined swimming. That is much easier and you can eat whatever you want! I'd recommend those two sports to start off. Good luck!|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	Track/ Field + Cross Country    running+ calisthenics+ proper diet= weight loss|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Biking
QsbB6vkoaa	yeah, you should definitely start taking a dance class, there is a really good one called zumba and it's to lose weight and dance like a pro. and don't worry about not being good, because they have beginner classes. you can also do pilates those are great for your posture and you also lose weight. there is a list of endless things you can do, like swim, jog, use a treading machine, or join a gym.  good luck!!|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	OMG my name is Allie, but i spell it Ali. I am 5'2'' and weight 110 Ibs. No i am NOT anerexic, actually the reason i weigh that much is from muscle, but anyway, i play soccer at an elite level, ODP, lift weights, etc...if i were you i would eat better. I know how hard it is to want to eat all your favorite unhealthy foods. Mine are chocolate and more desserts, lol, but yeah. I would suggest walking at least once a day, long walks, and doing this: 25 jumping jacks, 10 push ups, 20 sit ups, walking up and down STAIRS 10 times, and by up and down i mean up and down equals one time. Do your dance classes, work out, eat better, do yoga. I think that will help. No gurantee you can get to 125 although i started training my grandma for 2 days and she lost 3 pounds in 2 days!!! No i did NOT starve her, i just made her lift ten pound weights, go on the exercise bike for 20 or 30 minutes, do some stretching, eat better and keep track of what she ate. Walked twice a day, one long and one medium, she put in 75%, sorry grandma but being honest, of the effort and her results were amazing!!!  Don't give up and i have total faith you can do it. If you ever need help with ways to work out i'm fine with you emailing me. If you don't feel comfortable i understand, but feel free about ANY info about getting back in shape.   Ali|`|qBcg4kG0aa	dance classes are amaaazing!i jooined one at a community center and even thoufh i play varsity soccer, i was having a hard time keeping up but its sosooo fun and it works. also i heard jumproping helps alooot!i heard the if you jumprope for 7 minutes its the same as running for half an hour. i jumprope everyday now and it is pretty difficult.thats what i would do so good luck!
AA10934463	the dancing class you can go to beginners class you should get some friends and play vollyball over the weekends make a club out of it and you will be in shape in no time|`|T9mMMIYAaa	thats only 25 pounds so it shouldnt be that hard if you lower the amount you do not stop eating just lower it and you could run and do other excercises it would help alot!
mx3gFmIKaa	Ok.  These are male prostate, epididymis, head of penis, testicle, vas deferens, urethra, seminal vesicle, cowper's gland.      These are female cervix, ovary, uterus, vagina, fallopian tube, and bartholin's gland    Beginning at Testes:  testicle  epididymis sits on top the testicle so?  vas deferens  seminal vesicle   prostate   Cowper's glands  urethra  head of penis  (bartholin's gland)  vagina  cervix  uterus  fallopian tube  Ending at ovary    Am I right?|`|3l9Dlidiaa	epididymis, vas deferens, testicle, seminal vesicle, urethra, head of penis, vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tube    The sperm does not go all the way to the ovary, it should meet the egg in the fallopian tube and I forgot what order the prostate and Cowper's glands are in.  The male anatomy is tricky to remember.
AAZ2yKdnaa	when i got pregnant i started having the symptoms about a week after i concieved. the symptoms i had were...  nausea, vomiting, headache, tender breast, mild stomach cramps, vaginal discharge, and back pain. but i wouldn't take a home test until your period is atleast 3 days late.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Not really too early.  everyone responds at different rates to hormone fluctutations.  the symptoms you mentions sound like pregnancy I would get a pregnancy test and find out for sure!  Good luck!|`|S5v9I0y2aa	I noticed a sore chest, nausea, and dizziness around 6 days before my period was due.  I tested lots of times, but finally the day before the period was due, I got a positive test!
Tf0WM1WMaa	you just finished talking about the guy asking you if he liked you in another question -.-  Im sure, you must be doing fine.|`|JdFgf575aa	Lucky you!  Yes.     GREAT!!|`|ewJMDIpLaa	yes  but don;t be a slut  guys like sluts  but girls don't|`|XtbjzpK7aa	good for you! but dont be like slutty and out there. people dont like that.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Yeah!! Shyness is tough, huh? I know. I go through it alot. Congrats on getting over your shyness!!|`|Daq9gituaa	You bet you are doing something right. Taking the courage to step out and overcome your shyness has paid off for you. You opted to take a risk and were rewarded. It does not always happen this way in every encounter so be sure not to let any negativity set you back if your next encounter does not produce good results. Good going my friend.|`|43942bc50710c4456dc14871795e132baa	Yes you are. I was the same way. I felt very self conscious around people, and I was extremely shy. But when I started to try to open up and talk to people and become less shy I developed more better, stronger friendships and actually had guys ask me out. And after all that I gained a lot of self-confidence, which has totally helped me in college. Good luck! You seem to be doing a great job!|`|UxMugqdraa	WOW! I'm 14 going through the same thing. What did you do?|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	Yes.  What you should do is not be afraid to join into the fun. Putting yourself out there, though not totally is a great way to become less shy. Just be yourself, though don't be too comfortable, obviously there are limits and you don't want to pass them. Be aware of how you look, no not clothing wise, but how you present yourself. People don't want weird people, ugh, like me, and so you need to be yourself but not freak people out, whether you are a genius, weird, crazy, pushy, or follow people, try to remain as neutral, you know what i mean? Yourself but yet not at the same time, one side for home, and one to be a normal teen. Good luck!!!
ZlNFOgO7aa	You did the right thing.    You need to keep a stiff upper lip. If she sees you get upset she will play on it. If you need her to go into day care, then that is what needs to happen. If she is in a good centre or home care, they will be good at distracting her as soon as you left. I bet by the time you go to pick her up she will be happily playing until she sees you, then she may cry because she will realise that you weren't there and where did you go.     None of my kids have gone into daycare as I can't afford it, but the same thing happened at kindy with my daughter, and I had to leave. I did cry in the car on the way home, I felt awful. But each time she was dropped off she got better and better.     Good luck, you will get stronger at leaving her. It is only for a day (or half day, what ever you needed) and then you pick her up. You are so used to her being around that it feels weird without her at home. I remember that feeling. Each time a child has gone away with Nan without me has made me cry, and they were only gone an hour, lol.    Chin up Sweetie.|`|AA10186411	My daughter is the same way, and she's been there since she was 3 weeks old.  I had to go back to school, so I had no choice.  She cries almost every morning and goes hysterical (she is 16 months old).  But when I shut the door and she realizes I'm gone, she stops crying and goes off to play! lol I always watch in the window to make sure :)  You are definitely not a horrible mother!|`|PBI3tCKaaa	My 3 month old attends daycare as I have college.  Suprisingly, after the first 3 days he has done great-  they almost look sad handing him to me when I pick him up.  IT is so hard, but if I ever miss him to much I call.  Never hurts.  And when you are done, and pick them up, there is no feeling to match that- it is one of my fave times of the day.|`|gmaCvh00aa	Hmmm.  Calm down, and think straight.  Do you really think this is the first time the day care people have seen this?  Has nothing to do with you being a bad mother.  If you were, would you care?    LOLOL.      You don't know how many kids I've heard of who scream when their mothers drop them off and are screaming when they get back...and the day care person will tell them that they were fine once you were out of sight and didn't start screaming until they saw you again.  It's almost a cliche!    It's not the baby's reaction that's the issue, of course.  It's yours.  Even though your reasons are sound for putting her in daycare, you still feel a little guilty, and hey--you miss your baby!  Perfectly normal, Mom.  As long as you give her regular time every night--even half an hour or so, they feel secure and in the long run, it benefits the kids to see and interact with other people early in life.|`|DLDweOcYaa	I had to go back to work when my daughter was 7 months old.  On the morning of her 1st day at childcare when I went into her room I started crying already.  I was sooo upset that I had to leave my child with complete starngers.  When I got to the childcare and dropped her off she was fine and didn't cry at all.  I rang the childcare centre afterwards to check on her and they said she was doing fine.  She enjoyed seeing the other children playing around her.  You will always feel quilty for the 1st few days but it does get better.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	My kids went to daycare full time because I worked and my husband had dialysis treatments 3 days a week. That's a pretty normal reaction for the kids. Both of mine did it and daily for a week; after that it became random. They were 2 & 4yrs old at the time because prior to that, it hadn't been necessary for them to be daycare. I was told repeatedly that they calmed down within five minutes of my leaving. I felt terrible about it to begin with but I didn't have a choice; I had to work and my hubby couldn't take care of them. Even when he was home, the first few months of those treatments made him weak & ill feeling. Kids get used to it pretty quickly though and before you know it, she'll be having fun and look forward to going.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	its normal|`|1v1m8a8haa	I felt the same way. When I had my daughter I stayed at home with her until she went off to kindergarten. But when I had my son I had to go back to work, it was very hard for me.  I cried whole day, I even went back for him he was three months.  So I understand, but it is a sacrifice we as mothers have to make for the sake of theirs and our future.|`|AA11795652	I put my son in the nursery at church.  Every time I hand him over he cries but they can page me in the service and I can come get him but they've never paged me so far.      I used to babysit kids and all the parents would call me just to see how their baby was doing and I would tell them that as soon as you were out of sight, your baby wanted to play and was fine.  It's totally normal.
659snXlEaa	As long as Jamie is the first name and Karmen the last or middle than yes. jamies got a gun, the whole worlds come un done, what are you gonna do.............. i like that song. I used to know a jamie, she was very pretty as a teen. good luck.|`|xWoJooeMaa	sounds like a boy|`|PD6OzS03aa	ITs a good strong name for a female but will be better if Jamie Carmen|`|t7DPKJb4aa	Yeah i think it sounds nice & cute :)|`|aFsoSiRIaa	I only like Jamie for a boy.  I don't like Jamie Karmen no way.|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I don't really care for the name but than again we're not the one choosing the names.  I think Jamie Karmen just sounds a bit repetitive.  The "M's" in the middle just kind of throw me off.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	And in my opinion, it's a boys nickname followed by an illiterately spelt girls name. Sweet and glamorous? Feh.    No, Jamie is not a girls name. No matter how many times you say it is.|`|2uWES9Agaa	sounds too south parkish|`|i98X99Q8aa	If you name your child Jamie Karmen thn it will be social suicide for her.|`|xZG0q6vXaa	Would KARMEN be the middle name or last?    Carmen might look sweeter . . .    But I do LOVE the name Jamie!  She & I grew up together as best friends from kindergarten onward; we never had a problem with each other having close friends that weren't friendly with the other one of us -- I think that makes our friendship even more special!|`|Elxuvon8aa	It is Masculine for me if using a unisex first name I would go with some thing more feminine for the middle |`|ja427oPHaa	Maybe if Karmen was spelt Carmen. Too much like Karma.|`|6ccb483bdcbeec01ead0547481da3ba4aa	I like Jamie.  Not too sure about Karmen though.  It's ok I guess.
fG7LmB7Kaa	I think it's pretty safe you just want to keep and eye on a couple things.   1st while pregnant and exercising you don't want your heartbeat above 140. Climbing stairs may get it there faster than you think    2nd stop doing it if you get winded or dizzy. if you can't breathe comfortably you need to stop.     3rd you need to watch out for your joints you could put to much stress on them walking up and down too many stairs.     Best of luck hope it helps.  Here are some good reference points  http://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/exercise...  http://www.babycenter.com/0_the-best-kin...  http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/ke...

470d818fb6cb38f1c52376775ad75883aa	The stress you are feeling could affect the timing of your period. The symptoms you have been feeling may also affect the timing. I would not worry about it for now. The doctor wouldn't risk starting you on birth control if they thought you might be pregnant.    Your doctor probably knows more about what is going on with you then anybody on yahoo answers will, including me. You need to either follow your doctor's instructions or go to another doctor and get a second opinion.     Don't be too impatient. No matter what is happening, you have plenty of time to figure it out and decide what to do.      |`|qVw5TzSeaa	just don't take any pills before being sure you are not pregnant.    call your doc!  good luck|`|AhnsnuaCaa	Not saying you are...not saying you aren't but just to make sure your not pregnant you might want to not take the pills. Just to be on the safe side. Take Care and God Bless!|`|Dfgu2oW7aa	I would do as the dr. says.. and try not to worry there are many things that can have an affect on your period. Stress, medication, etc.
kQPGERVHaa	when i was first asked out i said no. i really regretted it, then i hint around and he asked me again, well it was actually was his friend. eventually i said yes. we went out from august-november:( i don't regret it.|`|LSkeAPBIaa	it was weird because it was on the first day of camp, years ago, and some boy who i have never seen in life life before asked me out. from that day till camp ended he was always asking, always getting close to and just made me feel really uncomfortable.. he was friends with my brother and he would always be asking my brother stuff about me.  i handled it fine but it wasn't really something i enjoyed.. i feel bad for never giving a straight answer even though it was kinda obvious what i had picked.

Look at the sale racks or wait for clearances to go and buy them. Target has really good bras. As weird as it may be ("Target Bras" lol) they are really good.   Also try going to a mall and just look for lingerie stores. 99% of stores will carry 32 BB because it's not that big (big would be like 38E), and it's not that small (small would be like 28 AAA).

5e5c65a2cd3552e7b1ff218d6c990e26aa	If you're 20 years old and married, you don't need to worry about what your mom thinks. I understand how much we want the approval of our parents - been there, done that.  But, the truth is, they don't always go along with the choices we make in our lives.      You can actually give your mom a little advice.  Something like, "Mom, I'm pregnant and if that disappoints you, I'd prefer you keep that to yourself.  I'd love to share this joy with you, but I'm not willing to let you rob me of this blessing."    It's OK for us kids to be assertive in expressing what we want from our parents now that we are fellow adults.  Good luck.|`|C156l7vWaa	First of all, it's your life and your kid, don't let that upset you. I mean sure it's natural that you want your mom to feel happy for you, but at the same time, you can't please everyone. Maybe when she had you at 20, this is bringing back unpleasant memories, just try to tell her and get her through it, cuz it should only get easier.|`|nfLyS1toaa	she is probably just jealous because you have a better life than she has had. i agree that a normal mother would be happy for their children if they had it better than they did. you are going to have to tell her that you are pregnant(if you are) and if she doesn't like it then hopefully your child will have better grandparents on your husbands side. just tell her that you would like for your child to have stable and positive grandparents around.|`|rKVKiyopaa	she probobly doesn't want you to grow up so fast and plus the money cost for a baby for 1 year is about well a lot so ya theres my answer|`|qVw5TzSeaa	I understand perfectly what is happening to you...  I was and still married to an angel husband and got pregnant after 3 months.  Same thing she said..  just ignore her and turn to people who encourage you for this matter...  Good luck|`|QAdv9xF2aa	   From what I've noticed, most parents are supportive of their children having children if they think you are ready, but many parents are not supportive at first -- it takes them time to adjust.  Your mom might be afraid that you are going to ask a lot on her part to help take care of the baby.        It sounds like your sister has many, many problems and your mom might be having trouble dealing with all of that.  This might account for some of the negativity that you are getting from your mom.  She might think you might be better off waiting a couple of years.  If you have the finances to have a baby and your husband is willing to do his part (taking his turn watching and feeding the baby) then go for it.  It sounds like your mom owes you a lot of credit and quite possibly an apology.|`|9a68ec7c7f5a11e5135cca9d439eddc0aa	Least you got nothing to be ashamed about being married is wonder full   Lease you got a husband to support you good that you not single  parent i not sure why your mum can get upset for  if she get  negative  ask her leave your house until she come to her Sense  |`|rVzGpSMXaa	Hi, first put yourself in your mom's shoes. Would you let your 20 year old daughter to have a baby? I wouldn't. I know you are so happy to be married to a wonderful person and all but would you let your 20 year old daughter to go through this task? She is still young & needs to learn more about being a beloved wife, how to take care family and house work and would it be appropriate to bear a child when you have so many things to learn & experience? If YES, go ahead. It's your life.    Your mom loves you and that is why she rather wants you to take some time to think, to prepare, to be able to stand on your own. (Remember she is more experienced than you)    Re. your sister, I also think your sister needs to be cared more than yourself. Your life and yourself is APPROVED by your mom. Your mom just won't say it. That's all. Because she wants her other daughter to be happy at least half of what you've achieved. You are no longer your mom's little daughter. You are proudly married and you should share the burden with your mom to take care of your little sister... ^^ Be generous, share the responsibility with your mom and try to adapt to your NEW self.

A salmonela vive no intestino de humanos e outros animais, incluindo aves. Salmonela geralmente  transmitida para humanos ao ingerir alimentos contaminados com fezes de animais. Alimentos contaminados freqentemente parecem normais e sem cheiro estranho. As comidas contaminadas geralmente s?o de origem animal, como bife, frango ou ovo, porm todos alimentos, incluindo vegetais, podem ser contaminados. Muitos alimentos crus de origem animal s?o contaminados, porm afortunadamente cozinhar cuidadosamente mata a salmonela. Alimentos tambm podem ser contaminados por m?os de pessoas infectadas n?o lavadas aps o uso de sanitrios. Salmonela tambm pode ser encontrada nas fezes de alguns animais de estima??o, especialmente aqueles com diarria, e as pessoas podem ser infectadas se n?o lavarem as m?os ao entrarem em contato com essas fezes.    Casos de salmonelose tem sido relacionados ao consumo de ovos, com identifica??o da Salmonella Enteritidis. Nos Estados Unidos da Amrica (EUA), diversas investiga??es epidemiolgicas tem associado casos com ingest?o de ovos cujas cascas estavam ntegras, tanto brancos quanto vermelhos, adquiridos no comrcio varejista ou atacadista. Assim, j n?o existem dvidas de que um ovo intacto pode conter Salmonella Enteritidis no seu interior (clara ou gema). Se este ovo for ingerido cru, isoladamente ou misturado a alimentos (ex: gemada, claras de neve, "mashmellow", maionese caseira, bife trtaro, macarr?o  ''''carbonara"), ou insuficientemente cozidos (ex: ovos "poch"), poder causar doen?a. Um nico ovo contaminado pode ocasionar um nico caso de salmonelose se for ingerido por apenas uma pessoa. Se, porm, este mesmo ovo, for utilizado no preparo de um alimento ingerido por um grupo de pessoas, poder determinar um surto-epidmico de salmonelose.    A Salmonella Enteritidis pode viver no trato intestinal de diversos animais. No caso das aves tambm pode infectar os ovrios e ovidutos, de onde pode ser integrado aos casos que est?o sendo gerados. O ovo com a casca rachada apresenta maior possibilidade de contamina??o (das fezes da ave para o interior do ovo). No entanto os ovos com a casca intacta a com aparncia e cheiro normais tambm podem estar contaminados (do ovrio da ave para o interior do ovo). Por tudo isto, os ovos podem estar contaminados na gema, na clara e/ou na casca. Muitas bactrias, incluindo a Salmonella, encontram dificuldades para multiplicar-se na clara, devido  presen?a de substancias antibacterianas e  ausncia de nutrientes necessrios ao crescimento bacteriano. Entretanto quando a clara  adicionada a outro alimentos, sem cozimento total, as bactrias presentes podem multiplicar-se, caso o alimento permane?a por mais de duas horas entre 4,4oC e 45oC.  importante salientar que, no momento da postura, a qualidade das bactrias contida no ovo pode ser varivel. Se for pequena, mas o ovo for utilizado no preparo de alimentos em que n?o  suficientemente cozido, poder haver multiplica??o bacteriana. Se isto ocorrer, o alimento passar a conter uma dose infectante capaz de ocasionar doen?a nas pessoas que o ingerem. A Salmonella Enteritidis multiplica-se entre os extremos de temperatura especificados acima, sendo 37oC a temperatura tima para sua multiplica??o. Nesta temperatura, a cada 20 minutos surge uma nova gera??o de bactrias, ou seja, h o crescimento exponencial, duplicando o nmero de bactrias neste perodo de tempo. Assim, um nico ovo contaminado com Salmonella Enteritidis, adicionado a diversos ovos n?o contaminados, deixados  temperatura ambiente por algumas horas, n?o sendo posteriormente cozidos de modo completo, poder levar centenas de pessoas a adoecer.    Uma ave infectada pode por muitos ovos normais (ovos n?o contaminados), mas ocasionalmente ela por um ovo contaminado internamente por transmiss?o transovariana. A freqncia com que isto ocorre  varivel.|`|o4cLC7inaa	A salmonela  uma bactria que infecta alimentos qdo armazenados de forma indevida.

3ye0Pureaa	My baby does this all the time, don't worry. I know the sound just brakes your heart. I agree with the gas comment, I just pick her up pat her back softly not to wake her up, release the gas and set her back down. Sometimes baby's just want the comfort of a parent.    And no it's not a ghost you fools.|`|PbBWJGsTaa	I don't know what my 9 month old dreams about, but she sometimes does this to after she's awoken from a nightmare.  Its horrible.  Takes alot of cuddles to get her back to sleep.  I think its natural for them to have nightmares even if nothing has ever really scared them.  Its probably to instill a bit of fear into them so that theyre not so vulnerable in the big bad world. i.e. nightmares probably evolved in babies to give them a fear or predators.

They are not really dreams like you and I have where we imagine a certain situation and react to it, but more like just a feeling that they get in their sleep, unrelated to any actions.    Although they are most common in preschoolers, it's not uncommon for infants.
b0p5pHIHaa	cute!!name gurl;)|`|As7Sw8VRaa	i like it|`|jlrJhCMKaa	I don't like that first name, but I do think Danielle is very pretty with your last name.|`|j2qrOjo1aa	sounds nice|`|KFsU0uuFaa	i dont like the first name..|`|XzV4bUeFaa	too much of a mouthfull!  Almost a tongue twister.  I like Danielle.  However I would shorten Kaidann to Kaidy.  Kaidy Danielle|`|5sYzlAjPaa	It is pretty, especially the Danielle part. i really don't like unisex names however. also, there seems to be a lot of a's and i's and e's.|`|5HGDhEjyaa	Good choice !  Good luck.|`|d802e4569c99ca9c59f3b076b0963fedaa	Kaidannce Danielle Chailland|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I'm not so keen on it. Hard to spell, sounds masculine and is also hard to pronounce.
zk3Bp9uNaa	Maybe wait it out (seeing as your niot thinking of conceiving now) and really think about it. Logic has to come into it, think of the wellfare of your children - if money is tight now, it will only get tighter with another little mouth to feed.  Maybe as the months pass your urge to have a child will pass. If its still strong and both you and your husband think you can do it, then decide from there.    good luck|`|vsuXCMqzaa	AHH, there's no one saying you have to make a decision RIGHT NOW as to whether or not another one is in the picture. Just put it on the back burner for now. In a year or so, re-evaluate your circumstances as far as health, money, your husband's wishes and then go from there. If you still want to wait, then wait. If you decide then you want another one, then go ahead. 3 C-Sections are no big deal and as you've proven being diabetic is workable too. Money is always going to be tight.    The motto is that you can always "have another one" if you want to, but once you do there's no going back. So instead of making the decision now just shelve it for a bit and revisit it later. You'll sleep better at night knowing that you don't have to make a final decision now when things aren't right.|`|mY19PPlIaa	listen to your instincts. You could always do a budget and get out the unnecessary expenses.|`|780ByZVEaa	well see how you feel in a year if you still have that urge go for it|`|C4ibOR7Laa	well you have said 1 year, just keep thinking ahead to that year, and when the time comes see how you feel, if you still want another baby then go ahead, trust me, money isnt everything, and when that baby gets here you will manage|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	In normal every day circumstances I use common sense.

99b9d77532164e17cd232b5ac3234a62aa	Well, I don't have kids with medical or mental issues, but I am a kid with medical issues.    My parents, siblings, and I certainly have a different family life than most people...and for that I am extremely grateful.  it seems like too many families these days are falling apart.  Couples get divorced.  Children run away.  But my family is as strong and resilient as life has allowed.  I worried that I was putting a lot of stress on my family, but they have let me know how much they love me and how grateful they are to have me in their lives.  It makes me feel so bad and regret all the times I fight with them.  I love them so much, and even though they don't know I'm writing this now, I think that they know that our family is only strengthened by the challenges that have been placed in front of us.|`|8YNOzBbbaa	I think everyone deals with different amounts of stress differently however those with child(ren) with problems of the medical or mental problems probably know the ins & outs of the hospitals more than others..I know I could probably get to the hospital that deals with my daughter's health problem in a coma ( oh wait I have..lol) & I know where everything thing in that place is..
NvWSOxawaa	It depends. If she is a first time mother stay close to assist if she needs it and/or if anything goes wrong. If she has had pups before then let her be with an occasional check in once in a while. Hope all goes well!!|`|qiyLq6CRaa	NORMALY DOGS TAKE CARE OF THE DELIVERY OF THERE OWN PUPPIES. IT AN INSTINCT THAT THE ANIMAL HAS AND YOU SHOULD LET NATURE TAKE IT'S COURSE.|`|AA11348933	Just give her a nice quiet, private place to give birth and leave her alone.  I hope you learn something from this before you become an OB. That the more you interfere, the worse her labor will be.  Set up a webcam or something so you can observe and see that everything will go fine without your "assistance"
d3IcVDNFaa	I love Max Jeter. It's different and it has a ring to it. Max, always sounded like a powerful name to me.|`|cHJ1Xf2saa	it's cute! i like it|`|djZQXxmhaa	I like the name Max but not together with Jeter sorry|`|oCpeTAbxaa	I like Max but not with the Jeter on it. ;)|`|jfMzKbXUaa	Max is nicer sounding.  I have never heard of Jeter...so its weird sounding to me.|`|i5DFgipGaa	loveee it|`|Lg8gXNG0aa	I think it sounds better as just Max, or Jeter. Not Max Jeter. But it's your child, you can name him whatever you want. |`|xbfWTSsyaa	Personally I don't like the way it sounds to me it sounds like more of a pet name...but in all its your baby so you should name it what you want not what others want.|`|AA11164105	no...again no!!rent the movie "tobacco road"...see lester jeeter in "inaction"!!derek jeter....i don't understand the fascination..... now peter max....after the german/swiss artist....i could undertand that!! as in peter max bennett....peter max sherwood!!!made for a greaat kid!!you're right to be cautious because names do really shae us even physically as well as spiritually and emotionally!!elvis....madonna....sade'..... allen  or roy rodgers ,"king of the cowboys"!!something with a twinge of the exotic to it...for in futre times the world will be an even smaller place,lots of international connect and communication with different cultures,races and languages...the right name could give a youth an edge in that regard!  good luck|`|lm5dkVNyaa	i dont like it, max is cute but not max jeter|`|QFYd9rWuaa	max is ok but not with jeter|`|qAOu5FcVaa	cute|`|OOk7H4bBaa	People might think you're a freak. But hey, who cares. Derek Jeter's the bomb......    I'm known as Jennifer Jeter so maybe Max and I can be buddies.    Actually, if you want, call him Derek. That's like, the best name in the world :-D|`|Elxuvon8aa	that is a crazy name I would never consider using it . Jeter to me just does not fly no pun intended as a name |`|5sYzlAjPaa	Sorry, don't care for Jeter.  |`|miFe45quaa	I love Max, but NOT with Jeter.  Doesn't sound good.    I like Derek though.   Max is more a nickname too..    Maxwell Derek (first and middle)     I love Maxwell Derek! It sounds really nice. He could go by Max =)  x|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	How about Max Beater?     Hmmmm.|`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	You mean like:  Max Jeter  Thomas  Smith???     It has problems. It's easy to misunderstand and easier to misspell?      "Your name is what? Maxgeeder? How do you spell that?"|`|ODMCAcPDaa	I don't know, the whole double first name thing is so 1960's Catholic schoolgirl...even worse on a boy!  I like both Max and Jeter but I'd go with first and middle.  I think both would be awesome as a first or middle name.|`|wRnnxg5saa	Well i would liek it if u call him max but not if u always say max jeter.|`|xdAom9t1aa	Hate It :-(|`|B4yaGaTFaa	Sounds okay.|`|tht0DrHsaa	I like Max by itself. |`|E2XbFVBQaa	Hate it!!!  I can just imagine all the names the other kids in school will be calling him. Your kid will probably be beat up a lot!|`|226OM9Ikaa	honestly, i think it's terrible.   double names always sound so pretentious. come here, max jeter! bedtime, max jeter!  how can you even say it with a straight face?|`|DQ0E67D7aa	I like Max as a first name but not Max Jeter as a whole first name. How about Max as first and Jeter as a middle.

hDnX6Vx6aa	This is completely normal. So is some spotting. I wouldn't worry too much. If it keeps getting worse, contact your doctor :)    Feel Better!|`|kbP32zIUaa	this sounds normal, expect some cramps and spotting your periods but take a second dosage if you are not sure, the morning after pill is not 100% effective and i still got pregnant after taking one..x|`|jssS7YULaa	Totally normal. Be careful if you have to take a second dosage later. It gave me the effect of nonstop puking for 7 hours leaving me dehydrated and having to go to the hospital... Some spotting may occur, but doesn't always for everyone!
kDvKc3npaa	Most guys i've talked to say they like it shaved better because if its not, during oral its like licking a cat and during sex its kinda itchy|`|mXFOru11aa	yes looks so weird with|`|AUK3lzEbaa	yes!!! i shave down there myself!!!!!!!!|`|gkeuj7JYaa	my bf says yeah|`|11d28a719b061143141cbe5fe883288caa	shaved or trimmed i like to see where im stickin it
6uRWoIjJaa	Spk to your parents, either write them a letter or talk to them. Tell them you feel too pushed to do things you don't want to do. Compromise with them, they do have your interests at heart, i wish my parents were more pushy, i never went to after school clubs or out-of-school activities as we couldn't afford to and i had to help care for my mum (till i was nine when i left to live with dad) who is disabled and also had to babysit for my younger sister from 11-15yrs (i know it is illegal now, but i still had to do it). Try to ask for some time for yourself to do something you enjoy or even sit down and read a book or spend some girly time with ur mum/friends... etc...|`|JdFgf575aa	Yeah.|`|owpjHPOxaa	I know what you mean.  I do year-round rep soccer, year-round field hockey, golf at a friggen country club, soccer reffing, volunteering at local ice arena, babysitting, piano, competitive singing, musical theatre... that was a lot to type.  Add expectations to top classes in school.    Last year it got to the point where my friend's parents asked me if my parents abused me in any way.      Sleep is really important for me, and eating well.  Don't eat too little, and eat healthy food too with water.  It helps more than you'd think.. Read a fiction book once in a while, calming music... etc.  Take care of yourself.|`|AUK3lzEbaa	It's your life, tell them straight up what you just told us right now. It's too much for you, that's normal, just do things that YOU want to do and things that YOU enjoy!! Good luck, best of wishes!!!!|`|Xu5BtID1aa	Well, going to school, and doing homework is a regular life for a kid in school. If you don't want to do the extra activities in school like sports and stuff tell them that! I can tell you this, doing chores and watching your brother and sister is a BIG help on your parents! I know you wouldn't like to hear this, but if they work a regular work shift like I do, they work from 8-5 i can garentee you that their workinetcard trying to make sure your family is happy, making sure there food in the house, and have clean clothes with a roof over your head is a hard thing to keep up for just 2 people!! The least the kids can do is help out around the house!|`|AA11119385	Yes I do. I go to a military school(public) and I hae a lot to do.

However sometimes girls can miss their period due to a lot of different things. Best thing to do is wait a few weeks, and if she still doesn't get it, go to the doctor.|`|PniClUZtaa	it doesnt necessarily mean that shes pregnant   cuz a lot of women skip a month  it might jus b a change in her diet|`|jiTKnCKpaa	she could be pregnant she needs to take a test|`|gT3apm91aa	sounds like she is pregnant|`|ca77cfd60dc99eb382e0fac493ebd286aa	not always. but wear a condom.. and get tested. be safe. be responsible.|`|uu2UEh3baa	No, stress and changes in lifestyle can also cause it.  Ask her to take a test. They must be done a few days before the next expected period to be accurate. Until now, try not to stress her out for a week or so, and wait. It might just be a bit late :)|`|lYy26IfTaa	Nope, there is a chance she has just missed out in a cycle as some woman even miss there periods for as long as 4 months!  But she may be pregnant if she had unprotected sex.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	not necessarily    It could be other  things, like stress, being underweight    also some meds affect the menstrualcycle    Best ask her to have a pregnancy test and then you'll know for sure|`|dl97DmmYaa	Do a urine test.|`|wwdW2Jqiaa	Werd dawg, that chick is totally knocked up. I'd stay away from dat shizz and hook up wit some primo honey...know wat I'm sayin, yo?|`|meXbwiQlaa	push her down the stairs.lol  talk to her and tell her that you're not prepared if she's in fact pregnant.  try to know as soon as possible or you'll not have other alternative if it takes too long before you know.  if she has regular periods you should be worried.    good luck|`|BlEyPSkAaa	no not really, just irregular periods, if its more than 6 or 7 weeks - worry. Well u shudn't be having unprotected sex if u aren't ready to deal with the consequence and responsibility.
olF9Hl6saa	Is she teething at all... my son started getting his first teeth around that age. He NEVER spit up until he started teething, and usually is was as he was eating or right after.|`|fp3KY1MJaa	It is because of the baby food. It is just her digestive system, and is normal. you will notice it less and less the more she gets used to it. it is just because its new to her system and she is learning to digest it. you will also notice a change in her stool ( just a heads up) nothing to worry about.

yV373JUiaa	so u know for a fact that you don't ovulate?  because if you do it can hurt you more than help you.    Any drug that you are taking while TTC must be discussed with your doctor.     besides the days you r are proscribed depend on your cycle. you dont just start taking clomid one day.    if you take it on the wrong days for your cycle it can mess up your cycle pretty badly.     Why not talk to your doctor about it? Tey will generally prescribe it to women who ask AND actually need it.|`|jNPCT96Xaa	Unless you have consulted with a doctor, you should not take Clomid. There could be another reason you are not conceiving and by taking these you could be doing more harm than good. But either way, 25mg is probably the smallest dosage you can take. If you are going to take it, know which days of your cycle to take it on as it is not taken the same way birth control pills are taken.|`|3l9Dlidiaa	I have only heard of people using 50-100 mg.  It is really dangerous that you are taking this without being prescribed by a doc.  It can cause hyperstimulation of your ovaries and you could also have an electrolyte imbalance.  Make sure you read the side effects and contraindications.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	25mg of Clomid is the lowest dose there is Generally doctors prescribe 50mg as a starting dose. Unless you are very thin that dose will probably not work for you. Even then, it may not work because I am fairly thin(5'2", 110lbs). I took 25mg in November and it did nothing but put me through hormonal hell. Strangely enough, I took 50mg in December and this month and have had none of the mood swings, night sweats, migraine headaches, and aggravation like I did with the 25mg. Good luck.
AA11927140	This is a really tough situation.  I can relate: I've been having contractions since 33 weeks and they have gotten pretty bad, but then taper off.  The thing is, they won't deliver you this early, anyhow.  I'm not surprised that they sent you home, but I am surprised they have not put you on anything to stop the contractions from bringing on labor, as it is too early for you to deliver.  At the hospital, did they monitor you and see your contractions on the strip?  If so, they should have given you terb (or something comparable) to stop the contractions.  This is what happened to me, and I have then been taking terb ever since b/c the contractions just come and go periodically.  I've had them fast and furious (the worst was 18 per hour!), and other times, not at all.  Again, this is to ensure that they do not get so bad that they bring on labor.  I wouldn't suggest the steroids at this point; I would call and ask why you are not on something to stop the contractions, if they are coming that regularly.  Good luck!  I wish you the best.  If you get NO help whatsoever from your doc, call a different OB and ask them what they think, because you are seriously concerned.
tfTQ6Cuuaa	Once your toddler is able to tell the difference between "boy parts" and "girl parts" I think the bathing together should stop. Maybe 3 or 4? I think he should sleep by himself but if it's storming out of if my daughter has a nightmare, I left her sleep with me. She is 6, btw, but it has always been that way. She has her own bed, own room next to ours, but sometimes kids get scared and I think it's mean to send them back to bed frightend and expect them to go back to sleep.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I think those people are nuts.    If children are going to grow up comfortable in their own skin, it helps a lot if at least one or two grown ups around them are comfortable in theirs.  Besides, there is just about nothing that encourages independence (sleeping and bathing alone) like doing it by choice, rather than someone else making that choice for them.      For millions of years, children were exposed to every aspect of their parents daily life, and we all got here, somehow without the children being broken by this exposure.    Setting an example of love and respect for everyone in the family is a lot more important that who sees what parts of whom or who sleeps near whom.     --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	I dont think of it as abuse, but I do believe that it makes the parent hold the child back from its independance. I think it should stop at a year.|`|dgM66nRBaa	cosleeping and bathing together abuse? No, I don't consider it abuse. But no I won't let my daughter sleep with me for the simple fact her dad is home and she's a wiggle worm. The only time I took a bath with my daughter was when she was scared of the water and I had to encourage her. I take a shower with her to safe water and I don't have any choose but to take a shower with her most of the time.|`|AA11349925	Well done to those who can get a good night's sleep with a fidgeting toddler in the bed! My toddler sleeps like he is in a washing machine.    Of course it's not abuse, how can sleeping be abuse? you can't breathe near your kids these days without some busybody sticking their nose in! people like that lead sad, sad lives.|`|NyNMe8jWaa	it's not abuse.  and it's different for every child/family.  my niece is now 26  mos and just stopped showering with her dad as she's "noticed" his boy parts.  i think that's a good indication of when to stop bathing with your child.  but he/she can still bathe with other children of differing gender until, i would say, maybe 3 or 4 years old.  as for co-sleeping, once you've let your child get to the toddler stage and still sleep with you, it's REALLY hard to get him/her to his/her own bed.  and at some point you have to ask yourself, are you doing it for your child's comfort or for your own?  he can't stay your little baby forever, and it's important for him to find his own independence.  i know it sounds cliche, but have you ever watched "Supernanny" ?  she has a really good technique for getting your toddler comfortable in his/her own bed and giving you both a better night's sleep.  go to your local library or book store and get her book (full of helpful hints and useful techniques).  good luck!|`|EkUiuiABaa	I wonder why you are co-sleeping?  You both would get a far better nights sleep in your own beds!  As to abuse - you cant generalise in such a way - I take it you know that you would not abuse a child!  As for baths again each case is its own...I would say bathing together and with their siblings is fine until they start to notice differences in a way other than just general differences!!|`|5baec14131fd7b822f3da2903a188129aa	sleeping with a toddler is never good because it doesn't teach them to be independent.  Once they feel the comfort of having you by their side, they'll make life hell for you if you refuse to let them into your bed.  As for the bathing together... I feel same sex parent can bath with the child until 4... but different sex parent should stop no later than 3 years of age.|`|hhPIfuiZaa	I think co sleeping should stop when you can get a full nights sleep without fighting to keep your child in his own bed!!!|`|1F7eYuNWaa	Co-sleeping is not abuse, any more than cuddling and hugging your child during the daylight hours is abuse.  Believe me, the child will eventually want his/her own bed.  How many 12 year olds do you know who want to sleep with their parents?  Children do not lack for independence just because they sleep next to a parent.  In fact, it can make them feel important, loved, and self-confident.  Of course, a child can also be those things even if they don't share a bed.  But imagine it from the child's point of view - what a loving environment in which to sleep.  Enjoy the toddler years while you can!
kPl8TTzNaa	None. Kinsley, Avery, and Finley are masculine BOY names and horrid on little, feminine girls.    Grace is lovely in the first name spot.    Grace Amelie  Grace Catherine  Grace Fiona      [Edit] Kinsley is girly? I guess that means you think everything that is masculine is girly, including your husband. Also, if you want a GIRL so much then why are you giving her a name for a BOY?|`|xOqhA1Unaa	Avery Grace!  Finley? wtf!|`|eZKP9MhJaa	Kinsley Grace|`|5sYzlAjPaa	i love Kinsley Grace - very pretty and sweet.|`|xLabGD6Maa	I like Grace or Kate|`|5HGDhEjyaa	I would go with Finley Grace ... very pretty name.

I am not so keen on any of the first names though. They are all masculine. Feminine names for girls and masculine for boys are the way to go.|`|TrUjyEJAaa	I like Avery Grace best|`|napKM2y8aa	Avery Cate, but if u want to keep Grace, u could make it Avery Grace!|`|As7Sw8VRaa	2|`|j2qrOjo1aa	Avery Cate|`|J18lftqTaa	I like Kinsley Grace, Different and not weird. Kinsley sounds cute as a child and sophisticated as an adult, a great combination.|`|Xa6i4VG0aa	I love those names, very elegant. Kinsley is my best, my I like the others too.     Take care, God bless. : )|`|3id49iPsaa	I like the name Avery Grace. It's very pretty. Finley I'm really not fond of though. Kinsley is alright, but, I love Avery!! :D    Hope this helps! Have a great day!|`|IN6weFmlaa	2nd one very unique spelling love it. good luck..|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	WOW!    They all are GREAT names!    I like how none of them are that common so then your kid doesn't have to grow up with that many others in her class.      I love all of them!  They are really nice names!  Aww man I can't choose one!  They are really gorgeous names!    Kinsley is probably my favorite but that was a really hard choice.      hope i helped!    Good luck!  |`|Sy1R6caeaa	Aww, all those names are so pretty!! My favorite name is Kinsley Grace.     And I really don't care how popular the middle name Marie, Grace, and Rose are, if you like them you should use them. You'll be the one living with the name so whatever you like you should use.    Hope I Helped!!|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Kinsley reminds me of sex (google Kinsey Institute), and Avery and Finley are boy names. Why not just go with Grace?    My niece has a boy's name (Casey) and she hates that boys have it, too. Mostly because the boys don't like her because she shares their name.|`|QC6CSotraa	Both Kinsley and Avery were on our list for a girl. I like Finley too but my p.e. Teacher in 9th grade was ms Finley. Out of the 3 my favorite is definitely Kinsley I still love that name.|`|LVgBTcENaa	Seems like you want a boy to me. None of those names even have a hint of belonging to a girl.

7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	Hun what you say here doesn't suggest she has ADD, Four years old my twins wasn't napping either and Kylie was also very much like your daughter she doesn't have any problems, most of the time diet can be a factor in a child's behaviour, Thomas has ASD Autistic Spectrum Disorder and doesn't have any problems you talk about here, I know for a fact if a teacher thought your daughter had problems she would be the first to say, she doesn't see a problem take that as a positive sign|`|8w0786yeaa	Well, she's four and acting like a four year old.  Let's not jump to possible mental conditions just because she's very active and impatient.  Most kids are impatient and active.  A lot of the times doctors and parents jump to the ADHD or ADD conclusion, put kids on meds when all that was really needed was a change in the diet.  Notice how the has been an increase of ADD and ADHD with the increase of dual income homes where the parents don't have time to come home and make a nutritious meal...it's McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Hamburger Helper, etc.  Diet plays a strong role in the behavior of a child.|`|kdu80NXzaa	I would suggest playing some turn taking games with her (snakes and ladders or something similar, throw a ball around). Teach her that she has to be patient, find something that you can reward her with and find a way for her to take a few days to earn the reward (make her progress visual).   A lot of 4 year olds don't have naps anymore, so I wouldn't worry too much, all children are different.   Children under 7 find it more difficult to concentrate on one thing without being distracted by all the other things going on around them. It is possible that their brains are less developed and have lower levels of dopamine (among other things). This helps to block other signals so people can concentrate. Some of the drugs like Ritalin significantly increase the levels of dopamine. There are many theories out there but most diagnosis will not be done on children under 6. It sounds to me like she is a healthy normal 4 year old who needs to be stimulated and interested. My 5 year old has similar energy levels and he is very far from having ADD!  Try to work on her behaviour, even if she is diagnosed in the future there are many methods to reduce the impact through behaviour modification. You may as well start now and possibly avoid the need for future intervention.|`|SMFzQsRXaa	really try not to label children so young. it is not add adhd. my girl is almost 5 and in these last few months of her being 4 she is the same. your daughter is growing and needs a good diet. she is also a only child(like mine) ans has more slack to act the way she wants. she is prob. around kids that are her age,kindergarten pre school and exploring diff ways. also my daughter will be 5 in december and could have gone to kindergarten this september(4 yrs old and almost 5) or next year. 5 years old and almost 6 years old. i decided 4 almost 5 because she was getting bord ant daycare/preschool. and starting to act out and boss little kids around (only child thing to boss and control)  look at her skills is she bord?  can she spell her name and everyone is learning to right now?  does she know her abc 123?  i can put my word on it..........she seems like she needs more stimulation in a learning way. tell her if she can hold her sillies in durning the week, take her to a drop in gymnastics class on sat.  sit down do a puzzle that is challenging for her, commit to time and get to her level and talk to her. remember they only know what  we taught them and they have only been in this world for 1,2,3,4,5,6 years. good luck mummy.|`|OH24rAy5aa	I have a 11 year old son with ADHD and it is horrible. I feel so bad for him because he drives everyone crazy and it is not really his fault. He was just diagnosed this year and for the last 6 years teachers have just been mean to him and he has been held back. I wish he could have been diagnosed when he was 4 and he would not have been so miserable in school. My suggestion is if you have a feeling then go to the dr now so that it can be determined early. It cant hurt just to check because if she dose have it she will suffer in school.|`|tgtsbxpBaa	I know what you're struggling with. Don't let anyone here say that you're a bad mom for even thinking that your daughter might be ADD. I've thought it about my son ALOT. He's 4 also, and seems to have more trouble with attention than the other children in pre-school (and soccer, and family, and church, etc) his age.     My son will be five at New Years. He can almost never get through a soccer game without digging in an ant pile or "playing airplane". He has had a very hard time adjusting to sitting still during "circle time" at pre-k. The fact that they have a 2 hour and 15 minute nap period is just about killing him! My son stopped napping regularly by the time he was two. No matter what I did (and trust me, I've followed every plan the doctor has given me) I haven't been able to get my child to nap regularly, or go to bed with the sun up!     He talked almost not at all until he was 2 1/2 and now he won't ever be quiet. However, he will rarely let anyone else direct the conversation. Chances are still 50/50 that if you ask him a question he'll respond with something even remotely on topic! Getting him to follow through with chores or instructions is a battle that seems to be getting worse instead of better.     Even so, I think it's probably far too early to be jumping to the ADD conclusion with either my son or your daughter. I don't think you're wrong for thinking about it. I think about it at least a couple times a week, and I have to "talk myself around" each and every time. Here's the way I convince myself I'm just over reacting...    They're only 4. Other 4-year-olds display almost all the behaviors we've talked about, even if it's not as frequent. At 4, a childs brain is still in a highly developmental state. Even things that are "abnormal" in terms of being not exactly like everyone else are not necessarily "abnormal" in terms of brain development. Our kids are probably just developing in a slightly different way than the others, but that doesn't mean they won't get to the same place in the end.     Besides, 4-year-old is WAY too young to start medicating, even if we did get an ADD diagnosis (at least if he isn't displaying truly dangerous behaviors). Even if he truly is ADD, medication at this point could possibly train or damage his brain in ways we aren't aware of, just because it's still developing at such a rapid rate. There will be plenty of time to worry about and diagnose such a problem if it starts to interfere with life and schoolwork in a few years. (6-8 is usually around the optimum range from what I've looked at. It's still young enough to help them internally curb problematic behaviors, but safer because their brains aren't developing as rapidly then.)     There are a few things I have done. I can't say that they've helped because I don't know what things would be like if I hadn't done them, but from the studies I've read they can be useful.     1) I've cut out virtuatlly all TV/Movies. He gets probably 3-5 hours of TV or Movies a week, unless we're doing something special (like taking a VERY long car ride). He used to watch more TV, because I thought things like Elmo and Sesame Street were good for him. However, research has shown that while sometimes the shows can be helpful, TV can overstimulate the brain in small children and lead to attention problems. The best part is, while he still likes his shows, he doesn't REALLY miss it. Now when he gets to watch a show, it's a treat!     2) I've never really let him have caffinated (spell??) or sugary drinks, but it's getting harder to limit them as he gets older. I still try really hard though, and even when school asks him to bring in a Soda, I'll see if I can find a bottled sunny D or Hawaiin punch instead.     3) Get eye-level when I'm giving him instructions. Even more, on days when I know he's have alot of problems, I physically touch him, look him in the eye, and make him repeat the instruction. This sometimes helps to get his brain under control.     4) (and this is the biggest one) Have patience! I'm not saying you shouldn't redirect, punnish bad behaviors, and reward good ones. Those are all important. But remember, loosing your witts (or temper) isn't going to make things any better. She won't be 4 forever, so enjoy it as much as you can!     Good luck, and have faith. She's probably just fine!
a333284eaf35e4caa60ed30bd58e6c42aa	hola, te explicare como funciona, los expermatozoides que llegan al ovulo son los que quedan aderidos a tu flujo, muchos se pierden y nunca alcanzan el utero, por eso es recomendable cuando buscas un bebe quedarse acostada por lo menos 30 minutos y es mejor con algo bajo tu cadera para que facilite la llegada de los espermas, tambien es bueno que tengas flujo tipo clara de huevo, este es el mejor transporte.  trata de no limpiarte  hasta pasados los 30 minutos y mucho menos lavarte, no quiere decir que no puedas quedar, pero si que sera mas dificil.  sabias que una pareja sana sin ningun tipo de problema de fertilidad solo tiene un 20 % de posibilidad de embarazo cada mes,  no es tan facil como muchos creen.  otro factor importante es estar lo mas tranquilos posible, y no muy pendientes del embarazo.  como ya llevan 12 meses intentando creo que seria bueno hacer una consulta medica, quizas exista algun problema, no te asustes por esto hoy dia existe solucion para casi todo, pero seria bueno realizar una eco, analisis hormonales, y a tu marido  un espermograma.  espero que tengas mucha suerte y pronto un bebe contigo.   estoy aqui para lo que necesites yo ya pase por eso.|`|PQkGzK6Raa	jamas retuve el semen.. cuando mi novio terminaba, yo me levantaba inmediatamente e iba al ba?o y hace 3 dias me entere que voy a ser mam!!!!!!  asi que particularmente no creo que sea muy importante para logar un embarazo!|`|rNPF07Sbaa	Una vez que el semen toca la vagina...ya corres la posivilidad de quedar embarazada, no tiene nada que ver que te limpies...ya te eyaculo adrentro...

IgBGeaeCaa	the most vital thing in the the short term is that your baby gets enough fluids , is he doing a normal amount of wet nappies , or maybe you have noticed that he doesn't need to be changed as much ?     formula tastes gross - if you don't believe me taste it . milk should be a babies main source of food for their first 12 months . when breast milk is unavailable - formula is best to be given for the first 18 months of life .   you can "hide" it in his foods , you can make him smothies .  he needs that formula! maybe he would like a different formula better - formula companies LOVE to give out samples , so if you wanted , you could try asking around , and try to get some different ones to try . some babies like "ready to feed formulas better - maybe there is even an enfamil one - i am not knowledgable about specific products .  home made formula is a very poor substitute , but if you can't get him to drink a comercial powdered baby milk product then that might be what you have to do . (you can get the recipe from the world health organisation web site - i had a look , but can't really remember where to find it ) .   good luck!|`|SS6ezGCYaa	If your baby has wet diapers still then It's OK for now you just have to make sure that you make up for it in the foods &vitamin& calcem that the baby is getting I have three kids and no one is the same I tryed rice milk too just talk to your doc me I just gave a little at a time to see how my baby's in sides would take the change  I hope you don't mind I just wanted to put my in-put in
iMULlxdgaa	Their families teach them.  They probably ahve tight knit families and some of them have even experienced the birth of a sibling or other family member.  The people that don't go to school, probably live in small communities in rural areas. They probably get a better education then most of us ever do!  And they probaly know how ot deal with child birth and kids better than we do too!|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Sex is a basic human instinct.

AsICkz9naa	People say that because the risk of miscarraige is greatest in the first three months of pregnancy. After that the risk drops dramatically. Also it's within that time frame that people have their first scan which can tell you weather the baby is ok or not. It's just a precaution really so that you don't end up disappointed if anything was to go wrong.|`|fPgl3b2Zaa	umm yeah properly not until your just over 3 months cause between 0-3 months you have a 50% chance of loosing the baby, I am 5 weeks pregnant havnt told anyone except boyfriend and my best friend for support dont get to excited about things..

I'm 14 weeks and 3 days pregnant now.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	We told our immediate family when we found out (5 weeks) and everyone else at 12 weeks.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Its not a rule - alot of people worry about misscarriage (which you are at most risk of in the first three months) so they dont share their news till after.    I personally told my family as soon as i found out, at 5weeks. Then at least if i misscarried i would have their support.|`|on5yFSsLaa	The reason there is a "3 month rule" is that generally if you are pregnant for 3 months there is much less risk of losing the baby from a miscarriage.  Around 3 months you will go to the doctor to test the health of the baby, hear the heartbeat, etc.      So, the rule is only a 'rule' as you probably wouldn't want to tell the world you are pregnant at 5 weeks just to see 1 week later that you were 1 week late....    Congrats, and Good luck!|`|ycy0y5Qqaa	there is no rule you can tell whoever you want.  the reason ppl say that is because you have a chance of miscarrying in the first three months so it would just be harder on you if it happened and everyone knew about it cuz then you have to tell them that|`|NdU3e83Gaa	why shouldn't you??? im pregnant and my family knows.....
uMIvRRjoaa	First- pumping is not an indicator of supply. It's an indicator of how well you respond to a pump. I'm assuming that when you're home you just breastfeed right? If you want to continue breastfeeding take the points so you have the extra 300-500 calories you need to make milk. Think of it this way: Why would you risk your supply if you truly do have problems?     Low supply  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-su...  You get very little or no milk when you pump. The amount of milk that you can pump is not an accurate measure of your milk supply. A baby with a healthy suck milks your breast much more efficiently than any pump. Also, pumping is an acquired skill (different than nursing), and can be very dependent on the type of pump. Some women who have abundant milk supplies are unable to get any milk when they pump. In addition, it is very common and normal for pumping output to decrease over time.     What to do if you're not pumping enough  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/pumpi...    http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mo...|`|KQL3tqS7aa	As far as the diet....it depends on how much formula you want to supplement your milk with.  WW is probably a good choice of diet because you can still eat a wide variety of foods.  Personally, I would go to the 22 pts. per day, but that's just me.  I used formula for my sons because pumping at work was not an option (military!).  For ab exercises, I found that Pilates was a low impact option that I enjoyed even a couple weeks after my son was born and also going on alot of walks pushing the baby jogger was another thing that I did that helped tone my whole body!  Good luck!

01Mu3wUeaa	Why have a special name for it? its not exactly something to celebrate.I think that if anything, it would be better for two people to do it on the same day so they can support each other since they both know how they are feeling.|`|K0SOqyAbaa	it's werid.     also abortions are wrong.|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	Neither one of you are worthy to be parents.

There are many false positives with the quad screen, and even soft markers.      I had two children that were positive for down's with the bloodwork and both showed soft markers, neither have down's.    Your child might not have down's.    I do think its odd.    I do think you are not a young kid, I just want you to be aware of the facts with the false positives and having an amnio.

VvXEkWLuaa	Personally I do not think you are pregnant. I mean, not all women show signs of pregnancy before they are but from what you are saying with you having your period and both tests being negative, chances are you aren't. Stress (from this, and other sources) could also have decreased the length of your period and when it occurred. Hope this helps!|`|szyrw5P0aa	are you nipples browner? plus a positive pregnancy test would be a dead give away.|`|rT2V6n3caa	you could possible be, check with your doctor, they will give you a definite yes or no. i know this may sound quite rood, also have tests for STD, just on the safe side|`|uYgIO5uuaa	You also could have had a miscarriage ask a doctor|`|hdgrIIN9aa	no it is veeeerry rare to have your period and be pregnant. if you had a miscarriage im sure you would be in extreme pain|`|cV5SKKURaa	I've never taken a pregnancy test that was wrong.

Good luck.|`|QeNYjcQdaa	It is possible to be pregnant with a very light period, but it can also be an effect of changing hormones due to regular sex, age, or just plain changing hormones for-who-knows-what-reason.  It is possible that you got pregnant but it didn't "hold". It's very common to lose pregnancies early on and never know you were pregnant, so if you have miscarried this early on, that is normal. Also, this early on, a miscarriage would probably not be painful. But if you are concerned, go see a doctor. Best of luck:)|`|uWOOmzcNaa	Please use protection!

Jusqu' l'age de 4 mois rvolus, seul le lait maternel (ou un lait 1er age) est indispensable, il suffit pour couvrir les besoins de Bb. Il est recommand de ne pas introduire d'autres aliments avant au moins le 5e mois. La diversification doit alors tre progressive et tale sur plusieurs mois.       Elle commence par de petites quantits de lgumes ou de compotes de fruits, puis de farine infantile sans gluten (au dbut pas plus d'une cuillre  caf par jour).    Entre 6 et 7 mois, Bb peut go?ter de la viande ou du poisson, 10 g par jour, puis augmenter progressivement jusqu' 25 g  12 mois. Du yaourt, du fromage blanc ou un petit-suisse peuvent tre proposs au go?ter vers l'age de 6 mois, ou une pince de fromage rap dans une pure ou une demi crme de gruyre.

pdsGIWA8aa	I would say no.  As a teenager your periods can be irregular especially if you are having sex.  Unless you are really late for your period it is too early for you to be having the other symptoms.  It sounds like your period is here so be more careful!  Though you are old enough to be a mom, you are not old enough or in a stable enough relationship to be a good mom!|`|4AO2myzKaa	A test is the only way to know for sure.  At this point the result should be true - either pos or negative as you are late.|`|OsH2JR9oaa	I would guess, yes.|`|NNGOQLR5aa	Probably not but it's always better to be safe than sorry. Take a home test and then see a doctor.

However, breast sensitivity might be a clue. Then again, you can have tender breasts with your period.    1) take a test  2) if you are, give the baby a life, put him up for adoption  3) keep your pretty legs crossed untill you love him and are married.  |`|LGidAYDwaa	It sounds like you are having PMS. It gets worse if you're anxious - and you have been anxious about possibly being pregnant.    Go ahead and get a pregnancy test or get your boyfriend to buy one for you.  They are easy to take, and - at this point - it would be very accurate.  So, take the test to ease your mind. If it does come back positive, at least you'll know now, rather than when it is too late to either get good prenatal care for your baby or take advantage of other options.    I would also consider going to a clinic to get birth control pills.  They can treat you without a parent's consent in most states, since 16 and 17 are the usual age of consent.  The birth control will not only keep you from getting pregnant, it will help balance out your hormones and reduce the PMS symptoms.    http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health...  some basic information about The Pill|`|v0cUDs4uaa	I think your best bet is to take a prenancy test asap to get an answer...

Then once you find out that you are not pregnant get some sex education and some birth control.|`|XwSdPn2iaa	piss on a pregnancy test    if your STILL not sure,  ask your mom|`|GuRluYmraa	First of all let me just say this..... are you kidding me, unprotected sex!!!???     ok, sorry to have to say that, its prob the last thing you wanna hear but you should be more careful and if your not smart enough to know about contraception i.e. a condom, then you should NOT be havin sex!    Any way enough of the 3rd degree, if your unsure got get a preg test by a doc and have him do some tests for sti's as well. The last thing you want is to find your pregnant and have some nasty infection!    Look after yourself and protect yourself!!|`|RZk8Bc8baa	It seems as if you are a little bit afraid of what might be going on. I say this based on the fact that you are asking strangers instead of those close to you. I UNDERSTAND! Being a young mom, I was a little scared too! I would say that some of those things could be pregnancy or period. The best choice would be to go get a pregnancy test. I know it can be a little scary, but you will feel so much better if you do. Also, if you are not pregnant, the stress of worrying about being pregnant, could be making your period late; thus making a vicious cycle. No period, worry about pregnant, worrying prolongs period! Everything will work out for the best, but definitely get a preggie test!! good luck!|`|chS02qSTaa	Hi...well, your symptoms sound similar to symptoms of early pregnancy.  The pink watery blood is called "implantation bleeding".  It's One of the less known pregnancy symptoms and is the slight bleeding and spotting that can be caused when the fertilized egg begins to implant itself into the uterus. This is known as "implantation bleeding" and it usually takes place between 3 to 6 days after fertilization.    Once the egg becomes implanted in the uterus - congratulations, you are no longer wondering about pregnancy symptoms, you are indeed pregnant. At this point you might notice a little bit of red or pink spotting. Not all women experience implantation bleeding so it is not considered one of the most obvious pregnancy signs.     The only way to know for sure is to take a pregnancy test- you should do this as soon as you suspect pregnancy.  Then follow up with one at your doctor's office or teen clinic to make sure.  If you are pregnant then you have a lot work and thinking to do- researching what option is best for you- decisions about your health care and the child's, financial arrangements among the few.  Take the test.  Good Luck.|`|sDbkr1uzaa	No i dout it because if you had sex just before you were suposed to get ur period i dout you were ovulating... but do check |`|5GuROyvpaa	Take a pregnancy test.

MqFeJiukaa	I am pregnant with my 5th child.  With my 4 kids I had an ob and I was always wanting to try a midwife but always went with what I was told was the better option.  When I got pregnant this time I ended up switching to a midwife at 24 weeks.  I regret not doing it sooner.  I have received amazing care.  My midwife never rushes in and out of the room, she has tried actually getting to know me and my family.  I feel more comfortable then I ever have with any ob/gyn.  I am really excited to have her there to deliver my baby.  I think you should receive care from the provider you feel is best for you and your family.  If something happens and you feel you need to go to the hospital closer to your house that is ok.  There is always an on call ob/gyn and they can always call and/or fax all your records over.  Best of luck in your decision.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I live in a small town and I had to travel 30 minutes to go to my doctor.. Then I had to travel 35 minutes to get to the hospital when I was in labor. They have a hospital here in town but they dont deliver babies. If you went there in labor they would just send you to the hospital that is 30 minutes away in a ambulance. So I know all about traveling when in labor. All I have to say is thank god the roads were clear and that my husband was driving. Also thank god I wasnt in pain.. LOL.. That could of been bad.. They told me that I needed to start heading to the hospital when my contractions were 10 minutes apart. Well my husband didnt wait he escorted me to the truck and put my bag in there and we left for the hospital. My water broke and that was it.. I didnt feel any pain and couldnt feel any contractions yet.. But I sat in the hospital for almost a day before my daughter was born. Good Luck!!|`|52otNiElaa	i heard from some hippies that if you do what the "establishment" doesnt want you to do and stand up while givving birth, that its a whole lot easier|`|o9nSygbEaa	My personal feeling is that I would much rather be cared for by a midwife than an OB. I'd drive the extra distance. While TV makes it seem like it's a huge rush to get to the hospital once you feel that first contraction, it's not (obviously). In most cases, you have more than enough time to drive to the midwife at the other hospital. And, should there be a problem that requires immediate attention, you can always go to the closer hospital.|`|cVcSjiBDaa	It may be all fine, but just have this into consideration:    You wont be comfortable sitting in the car for 1 hour with that pain.  You may have an emergency, you can get a plan b ready, just in case.  Don't wait until contractions get too strong or too often, do some research on all the signs of been ready for delivery, whatch out for signs of complications, if your water breaks, if there is bleeding, etc...  every pregnancy is different, even in the same woman, I recommend closed monitoring during pregnancy as due date gets closer and make a good plan,  Everything will be fine!|`|lADq4dNdaa	mate.... you'll be in labout for a LONG time most likely.  you'll have heaps of time to travel to the further hospital.  and when contractions start they are usually like 20 mins apart, so it wont be an unbarable drive.|`|LONO8pz4aa	As long as u make it to the clinic to give birth in time, go to wherever you want. If your water breaks go to the one closest to your house!!!|`|YppUiFANaa	the day you go into labor you do what your body fells comfortable with when i went into labor I was ready to get my daughter out both times the pain was horrible not trying to scare you I had to have the epidural it was like heaven in a shot with a button but it doesn't always work for everyone
fHuvS29laa	33 weeks pregnant with what my Dr calls the Plan B baby...    It can work but not always...|`|52U22fiAaa	It works but nothing is 100%.  You have to take it within 72 hours of having sex.|`|sZ2HuNrUaa	I can't give you a specific number, but according to the manufacturer, about 7 out of every 8 women who would have gotten pregnant will not become pregnant, if it is taken as directed within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex.    Works even better if taken within the first 24 hours after unprotected sex. Basically, the sooner you take it after unprotected sex, the better.
NcwBIqYJaa	Those definitely sound like pregnancy symptoms...the best thing to do is take a pregnancy test to confirm it. Good Luck =)

B52KNW7Haa	a test taken after you miss a period is pretty accurate but not 100%    Stress and worry can cause delays in your cycle.        So you had sex with your boyfriend for the first time and he didn't wear a condom and you are not on the pill?  Let me guess....You are 14.    If you are older than 14 years old....Then maybe you are just dumb.  Dumb as hell.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	After the first time I had sex my period was really late.

Yes, even though he pulled out or whatever, you could still be pregnant because a guy has pre-ejaculate that comes out just before he lets go of the entire load.

Small amounts of sperm leak out before ejaculation.|`|nYpweW2faa	maybe|`|WaU0hmD5aa	you can get pregnant off of precum so remember that when having sex|`|HjxwlFGLaa	go to a doctor noww!!|`|pcb8watraa	I am not sure how you know for sure no sperm entered. Pulling out is not safe at all. It's no form of birth control. I am having my third child thanks to this method. It's not that big of a deal for me because my husband and I were thinking about having another one but just not this soon. But if you are not planning a family you should stop doing this.     To answer your question you can purchase a pregnancy test that will detect HCG up to 5 days before you miss your period. They do not always work that early. So if it comes up negative 5 days before your period and your period is late then retest once you've missed your period. Pregnancy tests are much more reliable once a period is missed. Good luck.|`|8zNhcdpjaa	You could definitely get pregnant!  There is pre-sperm before ejaculation, so there is always a chance.  Count 14 days from the start of your last period, and that will give you the approx. date of ovulation.  If it was w/in 3 days of that, your chances are higher.  If your period is late, buy a test and see if you are pregnant!    Please, please use a condom next time no matter what the guy says.  There are too many sexually transmitted diseases out there that you can't even tell the guy has them.  These diseases can kill you, or ruin your chances of ever having a baby.  If a guy refuses to wear one, he doesn't care about you enough for you to be having sex with him!!!  Protect yourself-you are worth it.|`|Xj4bTobUaa	The is still a change you could be pregnant, during sex a very small amount of sperm can by ejaculated, If you buy a decent pregnancy test you can find out a week before your period|`|4pMcFTNAaa	Yes u can. There could be pre-come which contains sperm. Wait for your period if u miss it get a pregnancy test.|`|YH46aQCtaa	Well it's still possible. Try going to get a pregnancy test and see what the results are. If your not so sure then just go to the doctors!|`|bYCfubzHaa	yes|`|18cdf1eba9f3b26b25a3412bc7e71791aa	If you are really sure that sperm didn't "go in" then you probably wouldn't be asking this question ~ unless you aren't entirely sure of how someone could get pregnant. Since sperm are infinitesimally small and the average sperm count per mL of semen is 75-400 mill (avg. ejaculation 2-5mL semen) ~ there is no way to be completely sure you were not impregnated if even a very small amount of semen "went in" ~even if he "pulled out" at the end. Sorry to be so graphic.       What I guess you should be concerned about at this point is getting some folate/folic acid in your diet (over-the-counter vitamin) to prevent such things as spina bifida or anencephaly (brain malformation). A multivitamin is also a good idea to prevent fatigue.       Please email me if you want further info or just want to talk   Take care- Stephanie
54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	Spinach contains non-heme iron, which is poorly absorbed by the human body. In fact, all vegetables contains non-heme iron. What makes spinach especially bad, is the fact that it contains oxalic acids, which binds with iron and inhibits its absorption.     If you want to use Spinach (or other veggies high in oxalic acids) as a source for your iron, you need to cook it and eat it with an iron absorption enhancer.     Other foods containing oxalic acids:    Whole grains, chard, rhubarb, beans and nuts.    Here's a web site with a list of good iron sources and iron absorption enhancers.    http://www.healthcastle.com/iron.shtml|`|WuVW9uCAaa	google it|`|AA10711210	Spinach.|`|dRCJ62DLaa	liver  spinach   brocholi  red meat|`|tjNJAn75aa	http://www.healthcastle.com/iron.shtml    there is a list on here.|`|AA10227142	Clams   Pork Liver   Oysters   Chicken Liver   Mussels   Beef Liver|`|QuUoDkBLaa	red meat and green leafy vegetables eg. spinach|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	Blood, like blood sausage blood pudding, diniguan, liver and plenty more|`|v2ut95Wzaa	Peas, Broccoli, Spinach that sort of stuff...|`|EkUiuiABaa	LIver...spinach...watercress...|`|28HLij60aa	Broccoli has a high iron level.

Plum baby super porridge is great, its 50% quinoa which Is very high in non-heme iron.  To help it be absorbed though, you can stir in something that contains vitamin C, such as sweet potato and broccoli for a savory meal, or fresh orange for use as a breakfast cereal.  Quinoa has some vitamin C in it but not much.|`|1v1m8a8haa	Dark green leafy vegetables.|`|er13zfwAaa	A metal sandwich.|`|n8qfvIZfaa	are you talking about food for babies? red meat, spinach and broccoli are good sources or a fortified cereal with iron in it|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Beetroot, Spinach, Pomegrants, liquorice and Guinness.|`|wlAmUQe3aa	Dark green vegetables (broccoli, spinach, kale)  Red cabbage  Beetroot  Sweet potatoes  Meat, the darker the better (but don't eat liver if pregnant - too much viatmin A can damage your baby)  Fish  Lentils & beans  The herb thyme     To help your body absorb iron it's important to also get a good amount of vitamin C.|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Liver, loads of iron ideal for pregnant women, cooked in a rich gravy with onion fantastic,|`|dXVA1wHDaa	beans, leafy green veg, red meat    And by the way RE: the above answer.

qLkMSEBwaa	I would like you to email me..from there I will give you my direct email address. LET ME HELP YOU..but, let's go private.  Believe me when I say this..I understand more than you may realize right now.  But, until we can speak openly and private, please don't punish this sweet innocent baby who is more than  part of you, She's your own daughter!!!!!!  No matter how she came about,  The fact is, she is innocent here and Please let me do whatever I can to help.      For the record, my son was my miracle baby and I am still told I just got lucky and can not conceive due to my medical condition.  My son's sperm donor left me homeless, selling the home I paid for out from under me.  He raped me during the 2 yrs I was with him and after he left me homeless.  I just got on my feet when I found out I was pregnant....MY son is my entire world!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It does NOT matter how he got here, It just matters that he did!!!!!!!!!!!  I despise my ex, but I love my son!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you truly can not come to terms and accept this innocent baby for who she is and not blame her for the crimes of her father...Then please give her to someone who can.      No judgment and whatever you tell me is between us.  I swear that on my own life and my mom's grave.  {{{{{{{{{{{HUGS }}}}}}}}}}}} Julia    EDIT.........Email me at my other email addy...juliaa31@yahoo.com I will check it later and direct you to my main email addy.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	get counseling.  that's not something a one-paragraph answer from a stranger can help you with, but some real help is something you and your daughter both deserve.|`|TQW5E6olaa	You owe this child to give her the right to a life of parents who will love and care for her, if you can't do it, give her up for adoption. It's much easier for children to get adopted the younger they are. The older they get, the harder it gets.|`|eeGN977eaa	I think you definitely need to seek counseling to deal with this problem. You need to do it now before it has a permanent affect on your daughter. If you are not willing to do that I think the best thing you can do is put her up for adoption. You say that you "don't have the heart to put her up for adoption" but I think that would be the responsible thing to do in this case if you won't/can't go through therapy.|`|s1zitZMOaa	You say you don't have the heart to consider adoption but it doesn't sound like you have the heart to parent this child so you have to make a decision.     You can either take active steps to put the trauma and pain of her conception behind you - enough to where you can separate your child from the act that created her - or you face the fact that you aren't capable of parenting her and you look into adoption. If you haven't tried counseling, I would suggest you consider that first. Talk to a trained professional about your feelings and see if you can move past this. But you have to realize that your child deserves a parent who can bond with her and if you can't do that then you need to find her a parent who can.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	I don't think this is a serious posting.  It is a little too pat, and tugging at people's heartstings.  I'm sorry, but that is how it looks.  If it is true, contact your state's child welfare agency, and see about putting her up for adoption.  If it isn't true, shame on you for playing games with people.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	counseling.  just remember that a horrible experience ended with a beautiful child.  remember she is half yours.  and the other half must have some good - maybe not from her bio father, but from someone in his blood line - regardless you will find the good in her.  rape is a horrible violation, and it is an act of anger.  feel bad for the man's soul and cherish your daughter because she is the light that was born from a dark experience.  sadly you would carry the experience with you every day regardless, at least you have something beautiful you were able to take away from it.|`|XtbjzpK7aa	You can put her up for adoption.|`|i2nCISQtaa	counseling or have someone in your family adopt her..|`|aWkp6AJOaa	putting her up for adoption would be your best bet.  maybe you can have a family member take her for a while.  i don't know what your circumstances are but if you love her so much then you should be able to overcome whatever happened.  i would look into some counseling.  sometimes your local colleges will have some counseling sessions at reduced or even free rates while the students are getting their degrees.  i hope that you can come to terms with whatever is going on your baby deserves all your love.  maybe you can talk to your school counselor.  talk to someone it will really help.  good luck.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	i hope you have someone close to you that you can talk too,this must be so hard for you,its ok to say that you cant cope and take action to make sure that you can do the best thing for yourself and your little daughter,i really wish i could offer more advice,i hope you can get the help you need,take care xx|`|MKRemZkuaa	I think you should get counseling|`|dgM66nRBaa	Adoption would be the best answer.... Just remember that it wasn't her fault and she needs you in her live.|`|56ba25da115adfe2c7df170b693a1437aa	You say you refuse to deny her the right to life even though the manner in which she was conceived is the "worst day of your life".  Bless you for not denying her life in general, but now you must go a step further and not deny her a "good and happy" life.  Even though you now are doing things with her, your emotions will not allow you to bond.  Do you think that this beautiful child will not sense this.  It will do her much harm as time goes by.  There are many childless couples in the world who would do anything for the opportunity to raise a happy, healthy little girl.  Your daughter deserves the true love someone else can give her if you cannot.  Please, please consider adoption.  You can make many people's life better and happier (including your own) if you do.  Good luck and God Bless you.|`|z20d4fI1aa	I think you should give her up for adoption, that would be the best option.|`|gAkNPTXGaa	I think you should get counseling to help you work through whatever the circumstances were during your daughter's conception. Hopefully through that, you'll be able to love your daughter and bond with her completely. But if you find that you can't, it might be better to place her for adoption with a family that doesn't have any negative feelings about her, so that she can grow up in a healthy and happy home.|`|MQ83HGD5aa	You can either go to therapy and see if you can get past it or give her up for adoption. She needs a Mom and if you can't do that for her then you need to find her a better home.|`|721WsvZiaa	Umm it might be very Hard to  put her up for adoption  but if you do not want her that is the only thing you can really do ! sorry ia am not that much help !|`|AXEqOEloaa	The first thing is you need to remember it is NOT her fault. If what I am assuming happened to you is right I am truly sorry. I really wish I had the right words for you, but please don't take out on that innocent baby she needs you.|`|wuikNThjaa	Everyone makes mistakes that they have to live with. Do you really want to make another one? I know it is hard right now, but look at the big picture, 5 or 6 years down the road, are you going to regret giving your little girl up? I'm just saying really think about what you are doing. She is in this world for a reason.|`|d3f01e98de2e5c51674e288f380af4d6aa	There are millions of families out there who would love to give your daughter a great home. There is always an open adoption. However, since you don't want to put her up for adoption you need to start by getting some counseling. I'm not going to ask the nature of her conception because I think I have a pretty good idea. The best thing you can do is get help. Then if you still haven't found a way to cope you might want to sign over your parental rights to a parent or someone close to you, that you know will give your daughter the best life possible. Good Luck.|`|rA4F2J6Iaa	You should go to therapy to get past the "nature of her conception"  she may not have been conceived in a manner you approve but she didn't choose that......I suggest therapy like what they do for rape victims.....even if it wasn't a rape if it was just "bad decisions" I would get some counseling. She didn't chose how she was brought into the world (and perhaps you didn't choose it either.)|`|qGQCLFinaa	I would ask a family member to take her,  you may not be ready to be a mom & at least you can recognize that, but your little girl deserves to be loved, no matter the nature of her conception, she is a innocent human who deserves love & attention not to be mistreated because of something she had nothing to do with..... if you love her so much, put your feelings aside & realize she had nothing to do with it.  If you can't giver her that, find someone who will & can.    Good Luck, I know being a mother is hard at times I've felt like taking off & leaving my son w/ his father, but the moment i feel that way, i'm over come with guilt, i couldn't stand to be away from him one night, i would be  a mess, & that always stops me, because he needs me & i need to be a better mom for him, being a parent is the hardest thing i've ever done, but they are just innocent children they don't know anything else but what they are taught by the people in their life.  Think about what is best for her.|`|v070sAApaa	im 16 and i have a three year old daughter and sometimes i wonder if i should put her up 4 adoption cause she has to switch back constatley from me to her dad because we arent old enough to marry . but i dont know if i could bear it not knowing who she went if shes alright ect. if u seriosly think u must pit her up 4 adoption then let a famly member adopted her so u can at least see her|`|Kx3ZmpsQaa	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx... off u hun go 2 the doctors or talk to ur health visitor they will put u on the right road hunny i no what ur going thro babes it happend to me 10 years ago i pulled thou hun and i love my son more than ever the hardest thing is that he looks just like his sperm doner ,as unforty i new him xxxxxxxxxxxxxx all the best hun iff u want my email adress i will give it 2 u to talk about things helps a lot|`|28HLij60aa	I think in this instance you'd be best off with counselling or someone you can talk to. They might even be able to point you in the direction of a group where there are other mothers in the same position as you are.     I know how it must be terribly hard for you, especially as all your emotions from the pregnancy, the birth and of course the experience of likfe afterwards are all still running very very high.     You've done a very very very admirable thing in bringing your daughter into the world, and she clearly loves you very much.     For the meantime, just try to put things into perspective-you've raised this little girl in the way you feel best for yourself, and have undergone something that majority of us can only try to imagine. Try to think mostly of the love you have for your little girl, because you do mention thaty you love her. Am I right in thinking it's not your little girl you have the problem with its how she was put here that's tripping you up?     If that's the case then you need to get into contact with your health visitor or GP to see if they can get you into counselling or even a support group. There are also toddler groups out there especially for teenage mums which might help you as you'll be around people your own sort of age and on the same wavelength as you.     But please, don't give up on either yourself or your daughter...you have been this strong so far, you can do this-not only for your daughter but for yourself. Your daughter is happy, and you do all the normal things mums do with their kids, and you love her-that's the first step to bonding right there-you just need to try to separate your duties as a mother from your feelings as the victim. You chose an extremely hard path to follow, but it's not all impossible, and you've done much more than even you realise. Don't feel guilty for anything, you've done no wrong. But by the same token, try to get some help for how you feel before it gets any worse.     I truly wish you and your daughter the very best that life has to offer because you have so much to live for with her-she might have been conceived in a way that wasn't your choice, but she's here now to love and support you in her own way to help you through how you feel. In a way in that sense, you both need each other. Take heart from this and find your self belief to carry on.     First though, try to find a counsellor or support group if you can-just talking about it to someone who understands could be the start of your rebuilding your life.  With all the very best of luck, lots of love  xxxxx|`|nq2hDHR2aa	My son just turned one and I cant imagine not being able to look at him. Sometimes you just make the decision to stop feeling sorry for yourself and go forward making good decisions - of course that sounds harsh to some - but look - when I was 17 that was the best advice I could have EVER RECEIVED.     I had so many horrific experiences that had become my identity. Just stop. You decide from today forward. You take full responsibility for your daughter and the life she gets to live. Whoever you are - you can decide to change the way things are. Please email if you want my story and more practical advice to start doing right NOW!! Dont waste another year!! And obviously Im not a professional counselor so seek one asap.     And yes, as time went on I did go back and deal with my past and still have to & always will - but when I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and blambing others all day long - I was able to step back and let go - then be free to walk in whatever direction I chose. I want that for you so please MAKE THE DECISION TODAY & LOVE YOUR BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL!!!! SHES YOUR BABY - be the adult and make a right decision.|`|BnX2c7aNaa	Keep her. She's done NOTHING wrong. Step up to plate and be a mom.|`|U7Fvw8g7aa	So far you've been doing the right thing by doing normal things with her and not denying her right to life. That is a brave and rational thing to do. I think that you feel disturbed because other girls in your situation would have done otherwise. You are probably stronger and more mature than you can accept right now. I think what's bothering you is that you think feeling otherwise is more logical. You are doing something extra-ordinary by expressing the greatest kind of love to this child. That is something far beyond logic. You have a good and strong spirit.
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Women feel it at different times, but it sounds to me like that is what you are feeling.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	That's how it starts, another week or so you will start feeling kicks everywhere :)|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I felt mine at 12weeks - so it is possible    Congrats - you will feel kicks in no time - its so beautiful|`|WaU0hmD5aa	yes you can my wife did and she is not skinny either and congrats and God bless you|`|VJpdmd0waa	Every person is different I felt it for the first time at 16 weeks.  So it could be possible that you are, our you are just feeling gas...|`|pFyD5Mhtaa	You probably are feeling the baby. I am not a big girl but in my stomach I still carry extra weight from my first pregnancy but at about fourteen weeks I could feel my little angel fluttering around. A lot of people feel it earlier it is just the first movements are so light you tend to second guess if that is the baby for sure or not. So most dont count the actual first movements they felt just the ones they know for sure on.
AA11185897	If it was implantation bleeding wait atleast 4 days and test again with the EARLY tests.     I know I was anxious and tested daily till I knew for sure.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Possible you are pregnant but most of those symptoms could be in your mind or you might be ill.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	It is a real possibility. The test could be a false negative because it is still too soon. If it were me, I would buy more tests and take them about every other day until they show a positive or until i start my period. You can find them for pretty cheap so why not :)|`|YH46aQCtaa	You might be pregnant or it could just be the stress. Try going to the store and buying a pregnancy test and see what the results are. If your not so sure than go to the doctors!

And not another teenage mom in the world.|`|g7Dfos1laa	yes it perfectly fine to have sex, most ppl don't even know their pregnant at 6 weeks and their having sex.|`|3deb4a3d1fb3a72ca3cb65218aa7012daa	it sure is! in fact it may be more pleasurable now that you are preggo. you can continue having intorcourse until your dr says that you no longer may.|`|vfq04nc1aa	Hi  I didn't even know i was pregnant at 6 weeks and we were still having sex. It's very normal and fine unless you are a high risk case.  I'm now 14 weeks and sex is regular with no complications.  As my doctor says you're just pregnant. You're not sick or anything like that so you should try to live your life like normal etc.  Congrats and good luck with the pregnancy!|`|9yP0UPWgaa	yea .    im not sure but i think later on like in a few months you will have to ask your doctor|`|Xdxgxl8Baa	yes, there should not be a problem, however, sometimes ,it depends on the person who is pregnant and her health during the pregnancy, sometimes the first three months of a pregnancy are the ones that can be difficult and cause problems,like unwanted bleedings or any other kind of risk for the baby.If you are fine and haven't had any problems until now and if this is not your first pregnancy be calm and  enjoy your relationship.If you still have doubts ask your doctor,he/she must be there for you if you need it.
tDuMsa1daa	I was the same,my last pregnancy baby was very active during the day and very quiet during night time.  He did sleep well at night once he was born so it could be a sign of things to come...fingers crossed hey :) good luck for the last cuppla weeks|`|o1SQRetjaa	i am 34 weeks pregnant with baby   4  and this happens sometimes but i also sleep through alot of the baby moving too (told by daddy ) but if you are worried about it ask your doctor next time you go my baby can go all day with out a single movement and then all evening long go none stop so i guess just consider yourself lucky cause you wont be sleeping all night much longer|`|PW3hcVZiaa	My daughter was like that- she never woke me up at night.  Maybe you'll be lucky and your baby will be one that doesn't need motion to relax- that a GOOD thing!|`|ddP3klT3aa	My baby didn't move much at night..pretty sure he didn't. He does sleep all night. But that doesn't mean yours will. As soon as we got him home he stayed up all night. Then he got himself used to sleeping at night after about a week. He slept 4 hours straight always. He is 5 months old now and for the past several months he has slept 10-12 hours straight a night. But don't get your hopes up!
r9gBoBLCaa	No. I do not sleep in a nudie. I usually just wear a bra and undies. The day I sleep in a nude, will be the day I have a fire, I bet.|`|f57a735201cbe1357a7d68c97fe1003daa	Do what feels comfortable to you.  It is not weird at all!|`|oe7Cjbwdaa	I did until my little brother set off the smoke alarm on purpose and I ran out of my room with just a sheet wrapped around me.|`|k6XRVeJxaa	No, I don't feel comfortable.|`|6eaWRGaqaa	Nah, it's not weird (just don't do it when you have guests over, some may be uncomfortable). I don't personally sleep nude, but I wear short shorts and a tank (then bra and underwear). This is only because otherwise I'm too cold because even during the summer our house is kept at the same temperature.    -Catherine|`|c55O7jqXaa	I don't think it is weird, but make sure you have clothes nearby in case of a fire or you have to get out of the house in a hurry.|`|3rlgYhNBaa	It is completely normal for you wanting to sleep naked. I have slept in under ware and a bra before but never in the nude, I was always afraid there might be a fire then I would have to run out of the house naked. LoL.|`|ssrLnvvWaa	Im 16 and no i don't sleep in the nude being i live in a house with a dad and 2 older brothers. I could just imagine the house going in fire and the firemen finding me in the nude.|`|H90uflbFaa	lol not usually. i think i did once or twice during the summer when my air conditioner wasnt working and it was like 95 degrees in my room haha|`|6pEDLnrzaa	um i prefer wearing short shorts and tank tops|`|LDuzqDZKaa	No! I sleep in some soffee shorts and a cami top! I thinks it weird, what if someone came in there on you i mean like lol GROSS! No offense to anyone who sleeps in nude! lol!!|`|NxIsdJ5jaa	It feels weird to me.  I dun like it. :/|`|XXw7DUDRaa	i wear flannel pj's to bed and a night cap|`|I4JckrDSaa	i love sleeping nude. it is so much more comfortable but I do keep clothes close just in case something stupid like a fire or something happened. Also, I dont sleep nude if their are guests at my house just in case they walk in on accident or something.|`|rtCLJHlLaa	I sleep nude. It's awesome.|`|GdELhKMYaa	yes!!! im 16 and i sleep naked every night|`|YwTSzfPIaa	nope|`|KDVaGxbHaa	No, I don't but it's simply because I'm more comfortable in my boxers and a tshirt. In addition, I'm a volunteer FF so sleeping naked would slow down my response time (I'd have more clothes to put on)    To those of you who mentioned the whole bit about having a fire and being embarassed: I am a firefighter. Let me tell you that if it even comes to having to get you out of a burning building or some other situation - WE DON'T CARE. We don't care if your fat, skinny, naked, fully clothes, old or young, and we don't care about your race or gender.    On another note, I'm also an EMT, and there is nothing sexual about having to exam or rescue someone who is naked. Your mind just isn't there. It's not like I just dragged you out of the window and now your hitting on me....we're focused on taking care of it. (P.S. If needed, we carry blankets and jackets.) :) -Rob|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Nah, you're alone so what does it matter. My pants and shirts would always bunch up and it would bug me so I've just been sleeping in my underwear since I was 15.|`|d5K8wORqaa	i wear adorable pjayz so no i dnt sleep in the nudiee|`|MigBOiUPaa	loL wuts fat and chubby have to do with not wearing any clothes??    lol anyway no i dont i wish i could but someone would probably walk in and see me. lol i hate wearing clothes to =ddd|`|PlmT4lHXaa	When I'm with my boyfriend.    I'm not skinny either, who cares.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	i usually sleep with the clothes i had on during the day as long as they are clean but I enjoy sleeping with my boxers on but not in the nude(dont want junk being scratched by any spare crumbs or rough fabric)|`|r39EDGhPaa	I hate being naked.  So no.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	adults do too... i always do in the summer ,|`|awXx7N2baa	i don't wear a bra when i sleep but i wear clothes|`|9acXPi8gaa	No! For several reasons:  I don't want anyone to see me  it's gross  I'd be freezing to death|`|NSXGQBkAaa	No, it feels uncomfortable.|`|kM9xoajHaa	I sleep naked with my husband, and yes i am married, still in high school, if any of you want to talk with me just go to my profile|`|90nnM99Paa	I don't, it feels awkward when the covers come off and you just kind of lay there. do what you want though|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	Sometimes I do, I do it a lot more often in the summer when its hot than in the winter. A bunch of my friends always crash and spend the night at my house so i keep some clothes on, but when its just me and blake or I'm alone i sleep in the nude.|`|nGwzzNTFaa	no but I hate it. i find it uncomfortable and weird .lol Maybe that;s because I have 2 bros though.|`|H6LxeWZfaa	i actually dont feel confortable  on;y because im scared someone will come in and see  but i usually try to sleep with less clothes as possible.  usually in my bra and underwear.   muccchhh more confortable to me|`|AA10934463	sleep ther way you want its the only time you have when people dont bother you and your body is at peace however you sleep sleep GOOD
d7kGopYxaa	I understand where you are coming from, I also where your dad is coming from. You should ask if there can be a trial where both of your needs are met.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	sorry.  i'm in the same boat-  except i can't even be out til nine thirty.  and i'm not allowed to have a boyfriend.  no exceptions.  and the worst part is i'm a very responsible kid with a good head on my shoulders and an all A Student.|`|BqO5xKLkaa	The only thing you can do at this point is to do whatever you want when you get to go out. My parents are the same way, they don't trust me at all, and my mom doesn't understand why I want to hang out with my friends after school and on weekends. And I'm 17 going to be 18 in 18 days.  What I'm going to do is move out and live with my older friends.  But, every parent knows when a person is considered an adult. And when you get to that age, they can't give you curfews and control you anymore.  Which is good.|`|3bQaEVmTaa	its the same for me too. its always that i want  you safe speech but honestly u might have to wait|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	At 16, we all wanted more freedom. We always wanted more then what are parents were willing to give.   Your 16. Your a kid. You live at home. If you want more freedom, being able to do what you want, when you want, your going to have to wait till you move out. If your not changing his mind now, you won't ever.    Its called rules and parents. It sucks, but there is nothing that you can do.|`|af565335de3c827b045055757b2c07efaa	The best way to earn his trust  is by respect of his rules.  Slowly but surely he will see  that you are and always will be  the trusting daughter that  he loves.    It's a scary world out there and  is not as safe as it once was..  Follow the rules and be grateful  that they care so much.  Your time will come before You  know it.|`|3ef2Kfafaa	It impossible to change a father mind but little by little tell him that your friends are going out at night and you and ur friends have cellphones to call 911 or even him...look at the way to get  him no other choise to say :Ok go go....  Good Luck|`|VvCJMxUyaa	u can do nothing
CxRJwJsraa	Abby- This is a sweet name. When I think about this name, I tend to picture a little dark haired girl with green eyes and chubby cheeks. Probably around 3. If I try to think of an older Abby I get an artsy girl with natural wavy light brown hair, thin, loves to paint....not the image you described.  Molly- With this, I think of the redheaded girl like you described. I think this is really sweet. I can see a Molly who is kind and pretty and sweet...and I can also see a Molly who is stuck up  Holly- For some reason Holly is totally a blond name to me. I like the name a lot, but I can really picture a girl you described named Holly.  Bonnie- With Bonnie I see an older country church woman. frizzy dark hair short a bit judgmental...  Annabelle- Annabelle has always struck me as a girl with looong hair. The color is up for grabs though. I could see a girl like you described with this name. She's similar to Molly to me in personality. However Molly is a bit more playful, while Annabelle is a bit more reserved.  Jenny- this is another blond name to me. It's sweet, and I suppose it could work for the description, but it's pretty common....however if that is what you are going for then it's fine.    My fave is Molly, followed by Annabelle|`|yYOh0DUjaa	Holly. Because my friend Holly looks like that :)|`|igFvprvsaa	Abby or Molly they're both nice. :]|`|elS908UXaa	i think more of a holly or molly.|`|dvU21y4yaa	Molly, because I am a teacher and I know girls with all of these names but there is only one Molly in my classes and she is the cleverest girl in the bunch with a great attitude towards her studies and her peers. She's even sporty too! I think associations with a name stick.... :)|`|7adzqyGgaa	Jenny or Molly|`|RDXgQMGEaa	Molly or Holly. Two of my cousins are those names- and I call them Holly-Dolly and vice versa.|`|YQpn7XOeaa	Annabelle. and if you dont want that then Abby, but i prefer Annabellle!|`|OnDIrxNEaa	Abby is nice.  Holly's a favorite of mine.  I always picture a Holly with red hair.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Jenny or Annabelle (Anna).|`|pbfkYJ2daa	those are all really cute names!!  the girl you described sounds like a jenny :]|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Molly or Holly.|`|xLabGD6Maa	Molly|`|7ufheV16aa	Molly. I don't know why not about the rest, but I knew a Holly who had blonde hair and freckles. I just think that Molly fits for a red-head/brunette.
701FO16zaa	I got a + 3 days before I was due. The best way though is to go to dr and get a blood test!!  Good Luck!!|`|znlpUd9Taa	I got a very faint positive 2 days before my missed period, and it took 6 tests over 4 days for me to get an equally dark second line.    Make sure you are following the instructions to the letter.  I also found it better to pee into a container and then dipping the test in it instead of trying to catch the stream...    Good luck!|`|YuVSDBkzaa	It was right around the time my period was due but I don't have a regular cycle, it ranges from 21-28 days. Different every month.|`|r52rfBkeaa	I tested positive 5 days after my missed period... I was kinda hoping it was just late, lol.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	I got a + two days before I was due to start!|`|AA11612508	my test i took on a whim. I bought them and told myself i would just shelve them until 5 days before.  But you know when your ttc, you cant wait.  So i tested 9 freakin days before my missed period, and it came up positive.  So that must have been like the earliest ever|`|9a1eb97689a998e5c4bdd3b7fcbea028aa	I tested on the exact day of my missed and tested positive with the 99cent test. I used to waste alot of money with the expensive ones but the 99cent workes just the same and they are WAY better to keep for memory. For example the EPT and digital ones erased and not the 99cent ones. Good luck|`|wKJrZhj3aa	I tested postitive a little over a week before my period. :)|`|Om8Eab64aa	i got a positive on my 3rd day of missed period with EPT
TYRRjIv4aa	I like the flow of Slovinski :)|`|iwPH0xR0aa	solvinski|`|GHnkKwl3aa	Slovinski
aJLx0nhNaa	Probably, but I personally would not use it.  You just never know what could have happened to it.|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	if the can was opened then it needs to be used within a month, thats why they put these instructions on the can.|`|AwvWBROlaa	if its powder it should be okay.|`|PymLdXM8aa	if it is anywhere over a month then i wouldn't use it. Honestly open formula is meant to be used in a timely fashion but a month is the longest it can be opened. So to me it wouldn't be worth my daughter getting sick to save some money.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I am sure its ok but i wouldnt risk using it.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	On the back of the formula cans it says only good for one month after opening.|`|E0gm0mRBaa	i have S26 in my cuboard that didn't agree with bub. it said on the tin to discard 6 weeks after opening|`|nYtG6js2aa	Baby's are precious. Powder not so.   Please read the manufactures instructions on the can as formula is best used as directed once opened initially.
4LbTpgijaa	I have never heard of Alice in Wonderland curtains, but I think that would be too much, anyways. Just make the curtains match in color. As for the bedspread, they sell an Alice in Wonderland comforter at Hottopic along with the pillow cases. it's for a full/queen bed.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	why dont you have a boombox constantly playing Cream|`|SU8z0TUoaa	I love the idea, especially the hookah. You should keep it filled and within easy reach so that you can smoke it constantly. Try to get a hose for it that is long enough that you can move anywhere in your room and still be able to breathe through it. Wouldn't that be cool!|`|LSkeAPBIaa	Haha I'm wearing alice in wonderland pj pants right now. I'd go to a fabric store and see if they have any fabrics that are alice in wonderland themed. You could make your own curtains.  I'd have a lot of pictures from the movie hanging on the walls
c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	Sure!  Ovulation is different for everyone.  The best way to be sure is to start charting your temperature.  You can get a basal body thermometer from Walmart for less than $10.  Take your temp at the same time each morning and record it on this site: www.fertilityfriend.com.  They have a bunch of tutorials on there to help you get started.  Your temperature will show you when you ovulate so you can better plan your intercourse to make a baby!    Best of luck!|`|30C0oZl8aa	Yep! Ovulation is not an exact science. No one can tell u exactly the day when u'll ovulate, its just a geusstimation.  Its somewhere at the 1/2 way point of ur cycle. So ur in the ball park.
ehAG30Yvaa	Morning sickness is tough to gage because it's SO different for everyone. I was sick the entire time I was pregnant and it was the most miserable time of my life. Everyone kept telling me it would go away but it didn't. I got so used to throwing up it didn't even phase me after a while and I swear I was going to vomit my child out instead of give birth...ugh! And now that my husband and I are thinking of having another one the memories of what I went through are making me scared to go through it again. But it's definitely worth it. Hopefully you're lucky and being tired and light headed is as bad as it gets for you...but you're only on week 4 and you have a looooong way to go. Congrats & good luck!|`|jn34aSgHaa	well i got sick 4 times during my pregnancy and it was when i was 8 weeks but it went away by the time i was 10 weeks and the tiredness is going to be with you till you give birth.|`|4YCsXqMDaa	i didnt get it until i was 10 weeks along, and it stopped around 16 weeks. it was weird lol, i kept bragging on how i wasnt gonna get it and BAM one day i did!|`|754b5669f7d51e2b7739ea88b243aea1aa	Your lucky, ifelt like i had to throw up or i did. It was a constant sick feeling all day long. That nothing could bring me relief. But mines went away, with both pregnancies right at 3 months. But the tiredness stil continues. Its like i never get enough sleep and im 26 wks now.|`|AA11763588	Most women will get it by week 6 and it usually ends around week 18.    Remember that every woman is different and so is every pregnancy.
fG7LmB7Kaa	What you are referring to is called the RH factor it means you have a negative blood type and the baby daddy has a positive one or visa versa. You have to get a rhogam shot so that your body doesn't try to fight of the baby. My sister has to get them sorry i heard it's not much fun.|`|nzGdMWbZaa	I think your talking about Rh (-) or Rh (+). If you are Rh(-) then you need to get a shot if the baby is Rh (+). You need to see a Dr. because if you are Rh(-) your body will reject the baby.|`|42Ttd1UAaa	yes i did.  You must have a negative blood type.  From memory i think you get three needles in total, there isnt anything serious to be concerned about.|`|Coc593Ikaa	You really did mutilate the concept...    Your blood TYPE is irrelevant. The only pertinent part here is your Rh factor (whether or not you are positive or negative). If they are giving you a shot, then you must be Rh negative (A-, B-, AB- or O-). This means that you do not have an antigen in your blood. If the baby is positive, then you could be exposed to said antigen. Then you will produce antibodies to attack it. This is harmful to the baby.    Anyway, this is VERY common. Over half of the world population is Rh-.    ADD: Women with postive Rh factors will never need this shot. And if your baby's father is Rh negative like you are, you wouldn't need the shot either. But doctors these days will give it to you anyway since many women lie about who the father is. Doctors don't want to take that risk.    Also, as long as you get the rhogam shot, you don't need to worry about this. The shots are quite effective.|`|pqxXU9Mlaa	I have it, its becuase your RH Negative just means your blood type is negative no big deal as long as you get the shot. I did and I was all freaking out becuase I hate needs, i was fine I would not worry about it at all everything will be fine.
EtCRnDJMaa	oh boy!    with my first I gained 47lbs. I started out a size 2.  after i had her i bought size 8.  I was the biggest with her, then after that my last two I gained 37lbs.  But, I was still in a size 8 after all pregnancies.  Now, 4 years later, I'm in a size 4 & 133lbs  and I'm 5'6.5      even if you use the belly belt, you can still gain weight in you butt.  I did.  but everyones different.  I always had to try on the maternity clothes.  to me size doesn't make a difference, it's how you are comfortable.    I was glad to have her when i did, I couldn't fit into my pants anymore!!!  OMG!!! i gained 47lbs!!!!  LOL      if you can't returnthem, then i wouldn't by them online.  You should try them on first|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey hun,    ive gone up from sizes 8 in tops and 10 in bottom: australia sizes.  To a size 10 tops and 12 bottoms. So one size up.  i havent tried the unbottoming. Because i dont like wearing clothes that way. personal way.  I think you buy the same size, Because they have pants with bands in them alredy to help with growth,    I havent bought any maternity clothes just singlets. Because i buy one size up now and just shirts that are bigger in the front..     its better to wait until you need the bigger shirts to purchase them. Fair enough the pants. for comfort. But the shirt better to wait. as you wont need to purchase that many. i hope this makes sense. just dont buy to much. its not worth it.    purchase as you go along.     god Bless x|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	0   i wore my same jeans just unbuttoned my whole preganacy   i gained 21 lbs    i wore  a cami over the unbuttoned part that way no one could tell|`|W1p6LetFaa	Are you planning to buy maternity clothes?  Because most maternity clothes are sized to correspond to what you were prior to your pregnancy.  For example, I was a medium or a large before I got pregnant, and all of my maternity clothes are still mediums or larges even though I am HUGE.  I guess I never actually tried to fit into normal pants once I outgrew my normal wardrobe.  Besides, most maternity clothes are even less expensive than "normal" clothes and SO CUTE, so you might want to check out Motherhood Maternity!|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	Before I was pregnant I wore size 0's(juniors) and even then sometimes they were loose on my hips lol. I have to buy 0's short because I'm short.    Now I'm about 22 weeks or so and I'm up to a size 3( in Juniors) and they are comfortable. I suspect I will go up another size or two because I've gained a little more then half of what my doctor told me to gain so maybe another size or the next size after that lol.    I haven't bought any maternity clothing because I'm short and the maternity clothes basically drown me. I'm not ashamed of the weight I have put on, I want to show off my " baby bump" and so I buy junior clothing that fits comfortablly.     I went from a small to a medium/large in the juniors and it shows my baby belly and everyone says how cute I'm pregnant ;).|`|MsipL0Mzaa	at the beginning i kept buying regular jeans just in bigger sizes as i needed them,ill have to wear them any way after the baby,i didnt want to buy maternity,im petite and nothing ever fit....i bought my first and only  2 pair of maternity pants at 7 months and lucky enough to still wear them.....|`|UxwjpsKQaa	i was in maternity clothes by the start of 4 months. i've been using fleece comfy pants, cause i cant stand the elastic on mat clothing..|`|701FO16zaa	If you dont want to splurge on maternity clothes, I suggest buying this product called The Belly Belt. It connects with buttons to your regular pants,|`|hamdnq5Yaa	was a 7/8 9/10  I went up 5 sizes and ended up a 18. You don't  have to get that big if you watch yourself.  It's had to get off after. I think that a 30 pound weight gain is a good goal to shoot for.   Just try to eat healthy. Good Luck|`|pjgMW6qaaa	I wore my size 7 jeans just unbuttond..my entire pregnancy    And maternity  size medium..
tb0NMaooaa	aww love baby bellys.     To answer your question: your normal! My friend is ONLY 6 weeks and starting to pop out. Some women pop out right away.    Congrats!|`|FSPAKELyaa	:) i hope your not too worried...cos there is a lot more belly to come!|`|buoqtZeFaa	Awww you look cute not big at all you can barley tell there is a difference.      Good Luck with your pregnancy!|`|3klIx1Egaa	its normal :) every pregnancy is different remember, so not everyone is the same.|`|A9CB5m1faa	You look fine. It's not fat either...it's pregnancy! :) Relaxin is a hormone we also produce when we're preggs. It causes the belly to get big as well while it relaxes our muscles to prepare for birth. I started showing at about 10wks. This is my 3rd child and now i'm 16 wks and I look like i'm 6 months preggs. Just embrace it. Everyone's body and pregnancy is different. Good luck!
4KtPFzz5aa	It becomes more difficult with age, but 34 isn't that old.  I had my second child at 35, and had no difficulty getting pregnant.  The doctor tried to do an amniocentesis but the placenta was in the way and he couldn't complete the test. My son was born normal and healthy in every respect. He is now 21.  He's a senior in college, a biology major, and is going into a doctoral program this fall.  Just get the best prenatal care you can.  Great article:  http://infertility.about.com/od/causesof...|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	Yes, as you progress over the age 35, it becomes increasingly more difficult to conceive and carry the child may come with health risks.  Of course, while it is still possible to conceive and carry a healthy child, the risks of genetic abnormalities and problems increase significantly with your age.    If you are concerned, definitely speak with your doctor or consult with a fertility specialist.
AA11763588	Getting ready to POP! Come on over and help us Celebrate!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I just went online and typed in baby shower invitations....and ordered mine from a website. They already come all filled out and have all diff sweet sayings on them =)|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Well baby showers are given for you by someone else, not by you.  So I would let the person throwing it for you deal with that.  The invitations should really come from the person throwing it.
IxG2SMlEaa	There maybe a chance that u r pregnant. But chances are ur not given that u had sex during ur period. Unless u ovulate right after ur period because sperm can live for 3-5days. But ouvulation usually doesnt occur until  14 days after the first day of ur menstrual. And if u think that the right pain is not from ovulation u may want to check ur appendix out. Good luck and baby dust!|`|pX9DDdOEaa	i really dont think that you are , because   1. you dont ovulate that fast . it takes aprox. 2 weeks after your period to ovulate .  2.You shouldnt be feeling symptoms that fast .      But just to be on the safe side if you are that worried i would wait it out , && if you miss your period take a preg test sweetie,  thats all i can tell you|`|qfe5GOcMaa	yes, i honestly think you are, cause if you are peeing 5 times every hour that is 1 factor and not normal|`|KxBPpzgIaa	even if you are pregnant its not normal to pee 5 times every hour you should have that checked out|`|61cb2aded011c54e7053c3595bb6c0c8aa	JUST TAKE A PREG. TEST WHEN YOU MISS YOUR PERIOD?!?!? HOW WOULD ANY OF US KNOW? GEEEZ.
edbeaf74946e31ae50c17ddd80060083aa	I always make sure if I make a commitment ot one of my children that I keep it.  I don't "dump" them if something else comes up.    I make little "traditions" with each of them.  Maybe have a lunch date every Friday with one.  Watch a special comedy show each night with another.  Get Lebanese take out food to share on Thursday night. Nothing big just little things they each can look forward to and have me to themselves.    I tell them I'm sorry when I screw up.  I give them my opinion and what knowledge I have and let them make their own decisions.  I love them like nothing else.  I will go to battle for them and I always believe them and am on their side.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Hope you don't mind, but I'm going to tell you what it took from the child's pov....    As a teen, I had a GREAT relationship with my parents (always have and still do have a great relationship.)  One of the things I always considered myself lucky for was having the parents you could talk to.  If I wanted the convo to stay private, they respected that.  If I came with a problem, they always LISTENED before speaking.  They rarely just railed me for my mistakes, instead we usually had a sit down discussion about what I did wrong.  They let me make choices and let me learn from the consequences.  Basically...they respected me and I respected them.    Don't mistake this for them being push-overs.  I knew the boundaries and I paid dearly (usually with privilages like driving being revoked) when I disobeyed.|`|OCMq6FTdaa	I'm a teen, and i have a good relationship w/ my parents because they...  1. don't act like helicopter parents  2. don't set too many dumb rules  3. don't act like jerks  4. spend time with me A LOT but don't make me stay home to be w/ them  5. give me freedom to make  my own choices    note: some may say this is bad parenting, I have never been drunk, don't party, never tried drugs, virgin, straight A's, strong friendships, plan on attending Yale. And I love my parents|`|omqS0q5Naa	I don't discipline my kids out of anger I discpline them out of love.I try to show them the respect  that I want them to show me.As far as being there friend I try dosen't always work because being a parent comes first.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	My parents and I have an AMAZING relationship.They never spanked me and always told me "You never hit somebody you love".I have always lived by that and none of my family ever hits eachother.My parents lett me cuzz but never in school or outside the house.I was always told that I could choose my religion and they never pushed anything on me.My parents have a great marriage.A good marriage is always a good thing for a child to see.I was always encouraged to question things and not just believe what everybody else says or does.I do get in fights but we talk it out and it over with and we move on.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	I am 17 and I have a great relationship with my parents as well.  I never fight with them, and I haven't even gotten in trouble since I was about 9 because I always want to please them!  And I actually have never been grounded before! lol.  Well, I think one good thing they did was that they built a good relationship with me from the start.  My dad worked but my mom stayed home with both my brother and me.  A lot of kids these days hardly even see their parents and are spending all of their time at daycare, which I think is sad.  But anyway, they just started teaching me right from wrong from the start, and we always had a really good relationship.  Even when I was really little I wanted to please them and I respected them.  If I did something bad we would often have a talk about it and that actually worked a lot of the time.  I understood why what I did was wrong, and that it made my parents disappointed in me, which I hated.  I was punished sometimes when it was needed.  Usually just time-out when I was really little, and when I was a little older loss of privileges.  I got swatted a few times, but never actually spanked.  My parents didn't believe in that.  And the swatting really wasn't punishment usually, because they usually only did it to get my attention if I was doing something dangerous or something, and it never happened when I was past 4 years old.  They are the greatest parents ever and I really appreciate them.  |`|CJvJVNbdaa	Great relationship may be an overstatement but i live by the rule i am the parent and you are the child i already have plenty of friends dont need another right now plenty of time for that when he adult instead i try to teach him respect and honesty and how to be a stand up guy and we have a very close relationship he tells me his hopes, dreams and secrets and as long as he secrets dont harm him or anyone else i keep them.  hope this helps
Y0dpiPozaa	It's funny that you ask this. I was the EXACT same way. I was never one to play with dolls and if I did, they were my sisters, not my babies... I have never wanted kids. I always swore I would have an abortion if I got pregnant too. I have been saying that since I can remember. But lately, I've changed my mind too. My boyfriend has 2 kids that he is fantastic with and it made me change my mind completely.     I guess when you see traits in someone that indicate that they would be a good father, it kind of softens you to the idea. Having a child is something really special to share, a piece of both of you, a source of unconditional love and I think when you find someone you really care about, you want to share that with them. Of course this doesn't mean you will act on it (I haven't yet), but it definitely opens your mind to the possibility doesn't it? :)|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	b/c you are young and hormonal and maybe b.c when you find someone you truely want ot be with and could see youself being with fo rthe rest of your life you plan for things like that.    BUt you are too young to have a child now. you have your whole life ahead of you and if you have a child you will put it on h0old. wait till after a wedding to get pregnant.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	You are absolutely right, just because you love someone doesn't mean you want kids- you might ultimately stay with your initial decision not to. Or maybe you will change your mind. You have so long to think about it (because hopefully you aren't thinking of having kids until you're out of college!)    Either way, just follow what YOU really want. Never let a guy pressure you one way or the other.    I'm in a bit of a dilemma myself because I don't care to have children, but my boyfriend wants them one day. It's something we will have to figure out in the future, but I know how uneasy it can feel not knowing!!!    My advice is just to be okay with the fact that you don't have to have all the answers right now. You have a long road ahead (so do I) before kids should be an option.|`|vp1K0bxwaa	Becoming pregnant NOW is a bad idea. Becoming pregnant in ten years in fine.    Hormones are changing your mind. I hope you don't want kids NOW.
o0Q7LmMsaa	i don't really undersand racism  last week i was sitting in church, and the sermon was about unifying and becoming one and accepcting differences and that we humans are all equal (i'm not going to get into the religious aspect of the sermon though, that was just the general)  anyways that sermon had me thinking. i sat and was thinking about throughout history and all the problems that happend and wars. just because someone had a different color skin or talked differently, had different traditions.  but then i realized that we are all humans and there is nothing different about us except the skin on our bodies and how we were raised and the traditions that we believed in.   other than that all of us have DNa etc  were pretty much the same.   just different characteristics.  so to get to the question  yes racism is wrong, maybe it's just a coincidence that the people that are doing that happen to be that race.  try not to hate, but to understand, everybody is raised differently some people may not have as much as others.  but really don't feel racist about it, and yes i do understand that violence is bad but there's not much that can be done =( , if more people tried to be understanding this world would become a much better place and there would be less violence|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	dude put a shirt on in ur avatar|`|MigBOiUPaa	u dont rly sound racist. u sound more angry at what the gangs have done to ur neighborhood. Maybe its just gangs in general tht u highly dislike.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	I am half Hispanic.  I don't think it's so much the HIspanic people, but the area you live in and the type of people it attracts. White people will do this too, and blacks and asians. But all the people who do stuff like this are all the same type of person (the type of person who would join a gang etc etc)    Oh and by the way, everyone is a little bit racist.   That is the way it is. Is that good? No. Is it real? YES.|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	I think the word you are looking for is "prejudiced".  You're kind of taking a small sample of people and lumping everyone into one group.  I'm assuming you don't actuallyt hate Hispanic people... Just those that live around you.  You don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings or anything, but you're sick of these people who just happen to be a minority group interfering with your life.    It's wrong to be racist, and you know that, and you don't want to be, so you're not a bad person, if that's what you're worrying about.  You're only a bad person if you are thinking these thoughts, saying these things with the intention of hurting someone.      Yes, I've felt things similar to this.  There's always that group of kids at school who mess up everything for everyone, and sometimes they happen to be of a certain race, or type of person (know what I mean?).  But then I get to know a few of them, and I get over it.    I think you'll get over it.  You'll get older, along with all the other kids, and see things.  You'll watch documentaries, read books, visit countries, befriend them, do all of those things that will open your mind, and help you understand why things are the way they are.  The emotions opposite of happiness are what get things done.|`|FrcqDZkPaa	Let me quote a little here.    "My family is hispanic, I'm American born."    If your parents are Hispanic, you're Hispanic. That's how it works.    "There are other gangs of other races that do not cause much trouble, they just skate and smoke weed."    A. Smoking weed is no small thing, as that is illegal.    B. I highly doubt that's all they do.    You're basing your opinions on a group of idiots who happen to be Hispanic. That, my friend, is ignorance.    "Is it wrong to feel sorta racist as a teen?"    It's always wrong to be prejudiced against people.|`|3mnYzbPVaa	It's okay to be upset with people who are ruining your neighborhood.    It's not okay to assume that the reason they do it is because they are Hispanic. That's not it at all. They do it because parents and other influences have never taught them that it's wrong. This could happen regardless of whether they are Hispanic or white or black.    I'm white and grew up in an ethnically diverse city (read: almost 60% of residents identified themselves as something other than white). After I've graduated from high school, the school's accreditation came into question. There were gangs. Students slept with teachers. I can honestly say I've never felt racist as a teen. Assuming that someone who is Hispanic is going to cause trouble is ignorant and unfair to them. Their genetics do not make them inclined to "degrade your area."|`|3HNP3BoKaa	As you said, you have Hispanics friends, So i wouldnt go as far as to saying your racist against hispanics. It's just those certain hispanic people that you don't like. You gotta remember that not every one is the same. Just because those hispanic people scratched ur dads car, doesnt mean the one your friends with will, just because he's the same nationality. In reality, it probably sounds easier to say "I hate hispanics" as apposed to 'i hate that group of boys over there tagging the church who are hispanic."  Not every one is the same just because their the same nationality.  It's like sayin "I hate black people. did you hear on the news how that black person killed that girl?" That doesnt mean the man down the road who happens to be black is going to do the same thing.  Remember it.|`|chfILbonaa	Well i can say some neighborhoods such as the subdivision i live in have bad people in it coud it be that you are only noticing hispanics being the bad guys every one of my neighbors are mean to us they walk around swearing at my granma they put all their snow in our drivewayand they throw sticks that fall from their trees in our yard ok all of our neighbors make fun of me an my bro at school they are bitches and you know what i have to live with it|`|Gr0UGqZiaa	I think it's wrong if you feel racist ever, but I don't thinky ur racist. I thin your just angry with the way things are going in your town.    I'm only fourteen, and yes I've felt this way. The place I live in is very ghetto, and I have the exact same problems as you do. Half of my town is ghetto and like yours, half of the town is white rich kids who smoke pot and get drunk ev|`|6pEDLnrzaa	Nope, if you have a reason that's not racist if they stole your phone, and won't give it back that is by far a reason. We used to have a extremely white school, but lately we've had a bunch of african americans and Hispanics come to our school, one of them wrote all over my locker along with the others by mine with the name was all scribed but was defintaly diffrent. And they took my ipod out of my locker, because i have it liked fixed so i don't have to do my com as much. but you have to have the last number. i got it back though, because they left it in my french class|`|wdmp9eYXaa	there is never a time when racism is okay or acceptable. but that being said it is not possible to be racist against your own race. what you are is disgusted at some Hispanics because they are destroying your neighbourhood that used to be real nice. they are damaging things that belong to your family. this is not being prejudiced or racist. racism occurs when you are against a race of people that you know nothing about. you just don't like them or anything about them. obviously if you yourself are Hispanic you know about this race and just have a problem with a few bad people that you know.
dvoelIXIaa	It is true yeast infections are more prone to women who are pregnant because of all the hormones. When I was pregnant I had one.     So you just might be. But I would make an appointment with your obgyn though, so you can get your infection fixed. And while you are there just ask for a pregnancy test.    Good luck|`|rk2oiTsgaa	YES BUT IT DOSEN'T NECESSARILY MEAN YOUR PREGNAT, IT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HAVING TO MUCH SEX...... YOU HAVE A VAGINAL INFECTION, GOT TO A CLINIC TO GET YOURSELF CHECKED B4 IT GETS WORSE AND IF YOU ARE PREGNAT IT CAN AFFECT YOUR BABY
382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	Yes, I feel your pain. I had many UTI's throughout my pregnancies.  Believe me, you WILL feel much better by tomorrow. The antibiotics work wonders in a short period of time. Just make sure you take the whole perscription.  Lots of luck.|`|1SxVIZd7aa	Girl i know how you feel. Im 20 weeks, and have had 2 kidney infections. Ive even been hospitalized for 5 days. It really is horrible pain. Make sure you stay hydrated, and take the antibiotics. Im Surprised they didnt give you something stronger for the pain. I was taking percocet for the first 2 days when i was in the hospital. I really hope you start feeling better. Get lots of rest...you have a big job ahead of you!!!|`|SjYbkWdQaa	with a normal UTI after you start taking the antibiotic youll feel better the next day. when i had a uti(not pregnant) it went away withing 3 days. with a kidney infection...youll be fine by next thurs. youll feel better everday|`|cb510696d0a5c4f47838f85e424ce421aa	You poor thing, I have a UTI but I am only 10 weeks. That is terrible. I hope you feel better.|`|NsTEWUMVaa	You poor thing. You have my empathy - I had a kidney infection (think UTI x 5) at 15 weeks in my current pregnancy and it SUCKED so badly. I was hospitalised for 3 days and got my antibiotics intravenously, which I sure meant they worked faster. Still it was 3 days of agony. Now I'm 36 weeks along with no recurrence and a big, healthy baby, so it resolved happily, but it isn't an experience I'd wish on my worst enemy.    If the right meds have been prescribed, you should get relief within 24-36 hours, and be feeling much better in 3 days. In the meantime, keep drinking as much water as you can stand - flushing the system will, help too.|`|wBpennsMaa	I'm so sorry you are going through this! On top of it you have probably wanted your daughter to arrive for over a week now! Avoid caffeine-containing beverages and practice good hygiene (shower daily.) Keep taking Tylenol to lower the fever. There is a light at the end of the tunnel if you keep getting proper care. You are not being a big baby. Pregnancy is hard sometimes (in my case more often than not) and when you are sick its hard! Yahoo answers is awesome for situations like these :-) Good luck!!
wLe7nBLGaa	mostly everyone i know went into labor during the night and went thru early morning. but everyone has babies at different times of the day...
2nfMSDiPaa	could also possible be twins...twins put off more HCG which then could also show up sooner than normal.    Congrats on the new pregnancy though!may you have safe and happy pregnancy!!    Take care|`|RPszYGXkaa	Wow you may be the earliest positive I have heard of!  Congrats!|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I never found out that early with a HPT but when I got pregnant the last time, I went in to have my blood drawn to check for pregnancy and it was at a 12.  Anything over 5 is positive, so I was very newly pregnant.  The doctor said probably a matter of days (so like maybe 3 weeks after they add in the 2 weeks).
CPwdVc4caa	If it's this hard to get in to your doctor now, what is that going to mean for you later into your pregnancy?  An office should never reschedule an appointment; they made it in the first place, they should keep it even if they are crowded.  It's incredibly unprofessional for them to keep bumping you back, especially given how important prenatal care is.    I'd find a new OB.  Mine schedules 3 appointments ahead so I know when I'm going and that there's a slot for me.  He has also said that, even though I only have scheduled appointments every month, that I can come in any time I have a concern and he'll make time to give me the reassurance that I need.|`|l7FOtgbkaa	i would try and find out what is going on at the dr office and in the mean time set up an appointment with another office that is reliable and that u feel comfortable in.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	I would say go elsewhere, unless your active duty, they kind of treat you like crap.

wB1EjmBnaa	You know girls need to be very careful, its ironic that when you are young it seems as though the smallest situation gets you pregnant. Then when you want to get pregnant when you are a little older, it seems to be hard.    But your situation seems very unlikely to result in a pregnancy. Sperm needs to find its way to your fallopian tubes to meet with an egg after ovulation. You ovulate 10- 14 days after your period ends, so there is no egg yet to fertilize.|`|HYlWlETAaa	The first one has no chance.  I have a daughter from having sex with my wife while she was on the pill on the day after her period.

Be careful.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	no, the water would wash it and dilute it and your on BC so no problem...    HEATHER a penis doesnt have to enter a vagina. If the guy ejaculates near her vagina and shes wet and anything brushes it near the opening the sperm can use the liquids to swim up. Its a very RARE occurance but it can happen.|`|PPgIQNB8aa	Is this a serious question? Do they not teach anything in schools. You have to have sex in order to get pregnant. Meaning the penis has to enter the vagina and the man ejaculates inside the vagina.|`|2RInFX4Qaa	nope. If shes on b/c it make likes a mucous barrier inside, which keep his little swimmers out.|`|595596cd6078454ba17da2f98f3d9c51aa	Yeah, don't worry...she can't get pregnant that way.|`|0BXNl2MZaa	Don't worry, that's wat abortions are for.

AA11763588	Some women never have morning sickness. I never did with my 2nd. Just try to remember you aren't eating for 2, you are eating for you. You only need to take in an extra 300 calories a day when you are pregnant. Drink plenty of water. In fact before you have a meal, drink a bottle of water to fill your stomach then try eating, this will help keep you full. Or eat 6 small meals thought out the day rather than 3 large meals. Healthy snacks like fruits and veggies are good too!|`|J3TRJPIwaa	I was eating a lot more than usual before i missed my period! It was one of my first signs and it has not gone away. I have eaten what I wanted to the enitre time and haven't gained any weight in my first trimester. I go to the doc next week so we will see how my 2nd is going :S. If you aren't having morning sickness then I would advise you to stock up the fridge. Fruits and citrus are great to snack on!|`|MPc0kS1vaa	if you can eat then do it. just be careful not to gain too much. its harder to lose than it is to put on. eat more frequently but smaller portions.|`|WcvsBgLuaa	I'm 4.5 weeks and I eat ALL THE TIME!!!!|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I went through that with my second child.  I also ended up gaining 65 pounds.   You should make sure you eat right.   Three baked potatoes smothered in cheese and butter are not a good snack.  But it sure was good.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	it was for me early on in both my pregnancies. i put on most of my weight in the first 5-6 months and hardly gain in last 3 or 4|`|pR4nLjyRaa	It's completely normal.  Some women can't stand the thought of food and others can't get enough of it. It really depends!  I am 6 weeks and am CONSTANTLY hungry AND the thought of food makes we wanna vomit! So not fun!  Eat small meals every few hours instead of just 3 big ones and some snacks in between and that should help with the hunger! Good luck!|`|yqQBcjDmaa	I know the feeling.  I am 9 weeks and am hungry constantly!  And have been since about 4 weeks.|`|KXPyWB5maa	Trust me your body goes crazy at this time every woman and every pregnancy is different. I remember i just could not feel full but one day bam everything changed and got nauseous all the time. Where as my pregnant friend did not want to eat anything and slept all the time in the first trimester. I remember my second trimester all i could stomach was watermelon and my third trimester was mash potato. Try to eat a wide variety of healthy foods and you should be fine. Dont stress too much I put on 30 kg with my baby and now she 4 months old and I just have 9 kg left and have not really done anything.  Dont stress!!!Enjoy each new milestone and day of your pregnancy it truly is a wonderful time!!!! Ps sleep now cause you wont when bubby comes.

TRUST ME IT WORKS EVERY TIME....
AA11763588	Most test will change to positive once they've sat there for a long time.

iF92Q2f3aa	If the baby is very young (with 3 naps a day, he probably is) this all sounds fine and the parents should be very happy with you. A really good thing for everybody is to have a book such as Penelope Leach's "The First Five Years" and consult it frequently.     I would not have the TV on while he's awake. When he's older you can discuss what children's show, if any, you could watch with him. I also think you're doing the right thing by limiting your computer use the way you are.     Probably you're a tidy person, but I mention this only because of our experiences with a nanny who simply hadn't thought of this: keep the kitchen surfaces wiped clean and put things away, so that when they get home they aren't greeted with any mess. This is a great psychological boost for the parents.     Above all, parents need to feel that they can trust you and that you respect them and their home as well as giving wonderful care to their baby.     You sound like a good conscientious nanny. If my children were still small I'd hire you!    Here are a few reasons I gave up trying to have a nanny: at different times, these nice young women did some or all of the following: had the TV on all the time, fed the kids lollies after being asked not to; made long-distance phone calls without permission; used/broke things without permission (guitar, bicycle) and then didn't tell me about it, so I'd go to use the item and find it broken) had friends round without permission (I came home early one day and found out), left mysterious smelly stains, unexplained; tried on my clothes; used my cosmetics; developed a crush on my husband and started overdressing for work in case he was going to be there; did just plain stupid things like taking the kids along to walk her bf's dogs while wearing high heels and then falling out of them and breaking her leg, amongst other precarious situations she took them into when she was supposed to be supervising the childrens' after-school play and homework...     Well, clearly this last one was devious and a dimwit, though she had glowing references. Suspiciously so, in hindsight. My (expensive) mistake to hire her. The others were mostly just thoughtless or lazy. But I have had good babysitters as well.     There are fabulous jewels of nannies, and they all share some characteristics: they want to be there looking after children because they like children and are interested in them, and are suited to child care (because the ones who just try to have a holiday in their employers' homes are doing the job for the wrong reasons), they are honest, and they have empathy and respect for the parents.     Good for you for giving this some thought! I assume you've asked this question not just because there might be a nanny-cam but because you're a fabulous jewel of a nanny!|`|s8VgyzE2aa	I am a nanny for 9 month old twin boys. I also have 4 of my own children, all in school full time. First I'd say drop the movie. I don't turn on the TV at all while I am at work. I'm not there to watch TV and it's not good for the babies either.    While the babies are sleeping I clean. I wash their high chairs, I do their laundry (the babies), I sweep the Kitchen wash bottles, straighten up toys, wash toys, etc...    I keep my phone on but I don't use it. I only have it with me in case the school or one of my children try to call me.     Our schedule goes something like this:    I arrive 7:30, chat with mom about their night and get the boys out of their exersaucers (she usually has them in there while she gets ready), and I play with them while her and I chat.     She leaves by 7:45 and I play with the boys usually working on things like colors, shapes (shape sorter), alphabet blocks, learning type things.     8:30 I feed them breakfast, they play with a toy in their highchair while I make it. After breakfast I read them some books while they remain in their highchairs (they love books!)    after breakfast I change them and get them dressed for the day and they play in their exersaucers for a bit.     Around 9:30 they take their morning nap which usually lasts about an hour or so.     When they wake up we go outside weather permitting for a walk. When we come back I let them have some free play on the floor for about 30 minutes practicing to crawl and just playing. After that I try and get some one on one time, while one plays in his exersaucer I will read with the other and do shapes or colors, numbers etc...Then switch and do it with the other baby. (I change them as needed usually every couple hours unless they have a pooh)    Around noon they have lunch and after lunch while still in high chairs I read more books. We also work on one letter a week and I am also working on some baby signs with them.     After that we play for about 30 minutes just fun play like songs, puppets, etc... (I always have their CD of children's songs playing for background noise unless we are reading)    Around 1:00 or 1:30 they take their afternoon nap which is usually about an hour and a half, sometimes two hours).     When they get up they have an afternoon bottle (usually around 3:00-3:30) and then we play more until mom gets home around 4:00.     Like I said, while they are sleeping I clean, wash bottles, etc...if I am done with all cleaning and they are still sleeping I read.     So If I had to list things you should do I would say    1. don't watch TV  2. read to the baby (it's best to start when they are young)  3. do some cleaning while they sleep the mom will appreciate it so much, my bos is always telling me thank you so much and how much they love me  4. incorperate learning into your playtime      Another tip is to talk a lot to him. Sometimes people tend to be quiet because there are no adults around but babies learn so much by hearing you talk, so talk about what you are dong "I'm making your bottle now, one scoop, two scoops, three scoops go in!" sing songs and teach teach teach.     otherwise you sound like a great caregiver who wants to do well :)|`|urrmckQBaa	You sound like you are doing an excellent job!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	How old is the child? I would suggest doing some learning activities - reading, sounding out letters, anything appropriate for his age.     Talk to the child's parents, tell them your schedule and ask them specifically if there's anything they would like you to do with their child. The parents will be happiest if you just ask, rather than guessing. Good luck!|`|UUpsa35Daa	As long as you're not on the computer or texting your friends while the baby is awake, i don't see too much of a problem with it.    As for the TV ask the parents and see if they want you to limit how much television their child is exposed to and abide by it, you can always turn on age appropriate music.    Other than those, i think all you've been doing is great.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I would get rid of the movie and turn on the stereo. Many parents have issues with small children watching tv and lets face it .. if the child is awake your attention needs to be on him and the tv needs to be off. I would also make sure to not be texting and using the phone unless it is to the parents. Your working time is not for socialization with friends.|`|o503YPrqaa	That sounds SUPER good for me! How much do they pay you and what state  are you in? Just curious. I have no idea if I will want a nanny when I have kids.
3dSCbIcEaa	i think u should go and be seen sooner rather than later.  Your ob can tell u if it is your period or something else like an infection.  If there is an odd smell, then it may be an infection.  After my last baby, i quit bleeding 3 weeks postpartum but one day at 4weeks i was standing up to put the baby to bed and i felt a huge clot pass and then i started bleeding very heavily.  I got dizzy, i felt light headed. i didnt see a dr for a couple of weeks after and she found out i had disseminated intravascular coagulation and i was lucky i didnt die.  Take care of yourself and good luck!|`|u1uECuFNaa	GO.  Bleeding is natural and unavoidable.   Some paps are done while a woman is on her period.   I think it is a bit much then, but you just had a baby. Go get checked out. You will feel better too.  Good luck and congrats on baby!!!! (boy? girl?)|`|3klIx1Egaa	still go, im sure they have seen it all before, and they can give you an idea to what the bleeding is.|`|20aec6d2a40cbd7b5bec23d43ae961c3aa	Go to your appointment to get a determination from your doctor. But, you can bleed up to or around 6 weeks after giving birth. Unless you are having other symptoms of an infection - it's probably either residual bleeding from the birth (blood would be very dark), or your period.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	Definitely still go...especially if you are unsure if it is your period or postpartum bleeding, or something different entirely.  It is better to consult with your doctor.
56yJXeM6aa	Now that I see your question it makes me think it does have something to do with the pregnancy because I had the same exact problems when I was pregnant with both of my children. I called my doctor and he said he could prescribe me something other wise I could wait it out.
q7sgWqZ3aa	Technically yes but these days many families have babies out of wedlock and many people don't use the word " bastard" to describe them. Usually its used as a derogatory word.    In the old days usually a baby born out of wedlock would be termed a "bastard" because the parents weren't married and sometimes the father was already married and had children already and so wasn't around that baby.    Nowdays, society has changed. Some people may still look down on a couple for having a child out of wedlock but don't pay it any mind.     Your not alone, you are with your boyfriend and the two of you are planning on marrying after the baby so you could say you were engaged.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Oh, no.   I am a ba...... ?!  I cannot say it. It is too horrible.  Well, darn.   My sister was one.  My first son was one.   What do we do now?  DO we all hide under a rock?  Run away?  tell me quick, please....|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Technically but if you live in American they are de-bastarized (yeah my lovely made up word).  It doesn't really mean too much any more.  Lots of babies are born out of wedlock.|`|FTW82Wumaa	Well...technically yes.   But it is the 21st century and tons of people have kids and even families and just choose to never get married. It's pretty normal nowadays.  I wouldn't really worry about it.   No one will think of your child that way.  Good luck!!!|`|f47HTHOkaa	According to google a bastard is defined as the illegitimate offspring of unmarried parents.   Don't worry about labels.
F8iyUqJBaa	The best thing is a tablespoon of honey 2 to three times a day.  Take some vitamin C to bring your immune system up.  Both are safe and healthy for you and baby.|`|6avKnzkoaa	I would believe strepsils would be okay. However, I would call up your doctor and ask them. Just to be safe =]    Try some lemon and honey - that's supposed to help =]|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Tylenol (acetaminophen) for pain relief... or you can have a cup of hot tea with honey and lemon if you prefer a more natural cure.    Cough drops...I'd watch the ones with extras (zinc, menthol) but a regular throat lozenge should be okay.|`|258e111d9f41b74795cfc21f74849106aa	I used cough drops. It helped soothe my sore throat, and they are ok. You need to check with doc before taking the Tylenol. I would say it's probably ok,but make sure.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	My safe list from the OB say that all tylenol cold and sinus products are safe. Any throat lozenges/cough drops are also safe.  You should probably call your dr to make sure they don't want you to come in for a swab of your throat. Usually the only type of sore throat that is contagious is strep throat. You will need an antibiotic to clear that up. Good Luck!|`|2nfMSDiPaa	lemon honey...hope this helps!|`|pUnjP0Jyaa	lol im pretty sure you can have a cough drop hun if you want ill look it up for you but im pretty sure you cna itoo have a sore throat odd it came out of nowhere just yesterday morning;lol but yeaa its only a cough drop|`|4GmeIopoaa	Gargling salt water is the best thing to do in your situation.  I know it taste gross but it helps out ALOT with the pain and kills the germs.    My Grandma used to make me to it all the time when I had Tonsilitous or Strep.|`|aqY13vWNaa	I don't know about the cough drops, but try to eat these    Snacks  Hot Cocoa  Hot Tea  Popsicles  Meals  Mashes Potatoes  Soup  Cottage Cheese  Try to get some fiber in, even though its hard to swallow.|`|AsICkz9naa	You can take paracetamol at the recommended dose. It depends on how far along you are to take certain medicines. Could you not take some time off sick to recover properly?
d7kGopYxaa	no fast food  no sugary soda  a LOT of water  no snacking (if you have to have a snack either have low-fat yogurt or a piece of fruit).    after exercising have something healthy and with protein. for example, chicken (not fried tho, thats really bad).      ive never gone on a diet plan before, but i do 4.5 hours of cardio a week (90 minutes 3 times a week) its tough, but it works for me.  go to the gym and use the treadmill or the elliptical trainer.|`|MigBOiUPaa	just go running or walk everyday and stop eating all tht junk food and sugery drink.|`|Inc78M0Raa	I don't know if this is going to help or not.  Last week I didn't drink ANY soda, only apple juice.  And I lost like, 3 Lbs.  But I lose weight really easy.  So you could try it, but it may not work for you.|`|wJSYSgIlaa	from experience?    i eat heavy in the morning..  just right in the afternoon..  just an apple and/or juice for dinner..
AA10673927	Not really. It depends on the guy, I guess. Some guys might like that while others may not. I personally don't think it's weird at all.  (:|`|qmXFCVMIaa	i would like it if a girl asked me out   when i go to the mall all the girls i like i play off as taken, pregnant, or has kids ...so i don't say anything...|`|Evmgd3p2aa	Hmmmmm it really depends on the guy... but yeah, it is kinda weird except in the rare case of the occassional Saidie Hawkins Dance (Girls ask the guys) lol  But yes, i think its weird, though some guys like it.      |`|3bQaEVmTaa	nope sum guys like it|`|F3iEnj2Caa	I've always thought girls are lucky that the guys are the ones who have to do it. Its not really wierd, and i wouldn't think anything of it if a girl did it. But I think the guy would ask her out eventually anyways if he was going to say yes, so what would be the point of going through so much stress and nervousness (is that a word? lol).      plus i think a guy who is too shy to ask me out is a turn off..if you cant even ask me, how do you expect to have a relationship with me?|`|bSkYYRrEaa	Not at all. Every guy I've ever gone out with I asked out, and I've had some absolutely wonderful relationships! :)|`|SCXkBWk6aa	not these days... not from personal experience or anything but girls i know just do it...  :)|`|ZRsk0cAIaa	i think it is. it's just something i never needed to do.|`|cJ1hizgHaa	Ehhhhh, it might show the guy that your desperate, but the guy could be too nervous to ask so, if you really like each other though, it wont matter. I had a girl ask me out before, but it was online...now that's just pathetic.|`|d7kGopYxaa	Nope, Sometimes guys feel so awkward to ask a girl out.And they like that the girl has the confidence to ask the guy out.|`|L2UUj2hjaa	No, I hate all these rules that guys & girls make. Let the girls ask the guys out to, gosh. There are some guys that are way to shy and crap their pants to ask a girl out sometimes. I was like that my first time I asked a girl out.     Some people can be so judgemental when they see a girl asking a guy out... GET OVER IT!|`|3varN1KKaa	get them to ask u out cause is kinda weird asking a guy out|`|I4JckrDSaa	I asked this guy out who I had never talked to before nd we went to the fair and now we have been dating for a year and a half

AA11015261	call you doctor if you haven't already. i "spotted" for the first 4 months of my pregnancy and found out it was because the sack was not fully attached so it was like i was still getting my period. i also had spotting with my second child, it is very common for some women. however i did not have any clots but had tons of cramping. all i can advise is to get to your doctor as soon as possible and take it easy in the mean time. no heavy lifting (anything over 5 lbs) and stay off your feet as much as possible too, i know easier said then done. hope everything goes well.|`|rC0rjufaaa	some people do bleed in thier first weeks but it might be seriouse so go check with ur doctor. but sometimes its normal. but the best thing to do is go to ur doctor.|`|AA11762804	call ur doctor asap|`|XE45S6OTaa	I would go to the hospital.  This sounds gross, but grab a pad and bring that in with you.  Don`t let them examine you internally because many people say that this makes it worse.      If you and the father have a + and a - bloodtype, you need to go in anyways to get the rhamogam shot.      Where the bleeding has stopped, I think you are safe, but it`s better to check and be reassured than worry until your 20 week ultrasound or until you feel those kicks    Good luck and I wish you the best|`|AA11076076	Go to the hospital straight away.  That happened to me and I was miscarrying but some people do bleed.  Don't leave it to chance go to the hospital now|`|tvOAeGAnaa	not sure. Could be that or could just be spotting! Call your gyno asap.|`|A5KbJEH1aa	Sorry to say but it does sound like your miscarrying.  You should go to the hospital right away.  Theres a chance your not though..  But yeah go to the hospital right away..  Good Luck!|`|cb510696d0a5c4f47838f85e424ce421aa	You really need to call your OB. They can give you the best advice with this situation. Some people do bleed in the first trimester, but I would not risk it. Good luck!|`|xfZWmPJPaa	i had bled pretty bad for the first 12 weeks, turns out i had placenta previa, ( which means the placenta is covering the cervix, causing lots of pressure and bleeding ) go to your doctor and get them to check it out. they can tell through an ultrasound.    in the end my placenta had shifted and i had a normal vaginal delivery, 6 days ago! :)    good luck|`|br1fPSn1aa	Call your doctor asap!  I know you spot during the first few days after getting pregnant but you should just call your doctor to make sure everything is ok.
Bu6eSZSlaa	Are you serious, what does the guys age have to do with her being pregnant. Are you saying the old guy's "lizards" aren't functioning enough to get her pregnant, you need not give any more advice. Furthermore, the only how to tell who the father is, is do a DNA when the baby is born. Poor decision makin on her path sleeping with both men so soon & without protection|`|AA10405438	I think I see a paternity test in her future.  Young or old, sperm pretty much work the same when it comes to making babies.
iunCjAnhaa	Wait - is this in the right place? Are you asking about names for a HUMAN baby???    Those would be great names for a baby - just get him or her a set of tiny cymbals and a little red hat, and you will be set for life.  It worked for my neighbors, who, coincidentally have two monkeys named (of all things) Rombo and Milo.|`|hlq3Eo0haa	i called my massive ridge back dog puss puss, and my cat dog
DSSZZBTXaa	You just might be....you would be about 5 weeks along if you were and maybe your body hasn't built up enough hcg (pregnancy hormone) in your body yet. So best bet is to wait another week and take another and if it still comes up negative and you still haven't gotten your period make a doctors appointment and have them do a blood pregnancy test done. Best of luck to you sweetie|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would go see the doctor even if you are not prego there might be something else wrong that you haven't got your period yet. Also the doctor can do a blood test for pregnancy|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Go to the health department in your county if you don't have money to go to the Doc.|`|MIUzgwsTaa	wow if u were pregnant u be like a month ...  and u would know if u were a month!|`|r762ivr6aa	IDK|`|3bQaEVmTaa	just go to the dr. u prolly had a miscarriage and didnt know u were pregnant
xlcKBMw7aa	I would only serve wine if you're not going to have children around...  Co-Ed baby showers are fun...but then again i've never been to a non co-ed baby shower....  The food that would be good is anything that the mommy to be can have...it's not a good idea for a pregnant woman to have sushi...so that's out...  game ideas..."the price is right" you buy different baby items at the store (rattle...bottle...blanket...) and you have people guess how much they think its worth (keep the recipt) and who ever gets it right, gets to keep the baby item...they usually give it to the mommy to be though!!    give everyone a roll of toilet paper and have them tear it off at how big they think your belly is...    just send out a thank you card with a picture of your new baby...|`|k1l2jhr7aa	It depends on when in the day you are having it, with mine I just had nibble foods that everyone could pick at. I provided champange to.     There are some great games you can do, do a google search, I loved playing spit the dummy, where everyone has a go to see who can spit it the futherest, kinda funny, gets everyone talking. Also one where you are not allowed to say the word 'baby' or your 'name' on the day and if someone does they have to wear say a funny hat.     Hope you have fun|`|QRHufyHiaa	Some of my favorite baby shower games are  -the baby food game.         -you have many different jars of baby food and take the labels off, give everyone a toothpick and pass around the jars. have them taste and smell the food to guess what kind it is.  -or the candy bar in the diaper game       -you get mini sized candy bars, such as snickers, hershey, ect. and put one in each diaper and melt them a little bit and pass the diapers around and people have to smell and look at them and guess what candy bar it is.    just some ideas! good luck.|`|qMI6H6Lbaa	well i had a co ed baby shower and we had the men play a game that turned out to be the biggest hit. we had 8 ounce bottles with lemonaid that they had to chug through the newborn nipple they were not allowd to open the bottle or bite the nipple. but they joke was that there was over double the amount of lemonaid mix than the bottle said to put ie if it said 4 tablespooms of mix to 8 ounces of water we would put 20. they guys had so much fun with that even though it was nasty they loved it. also you can play a game where you take paper plates and about 8 different jars of baby food and number each one  take off all the lables but make a list of what each jar contains that goes with each number for a key. first give them a piece of paper lables 1-8 or how ever may you want to do and then have the jars on a table taped shut and they ahve to guess what the food is in each jar. we recomend dont get all the ones that are common get some ones at the store that you would never think of being baby food. after they have written their lists pick them up and give them a clean list then hand each person a paper plate with a spoonful of each foon on it nest to the number and they can nowtaste and write their guess first give a prize to the person that got the most right out of looking and then the person that go the most right out of tasting.  then you can take baby diapers we used the cheap dollar store ones and melt candy or other items in the diapers and and number each diaper give a list and pass the diapers around so people can guess what the baby had to eat. i recomend using regular hershies chocolate. hershies with almonds dark chocolate the kracle that has the rice crispies in it then you can put some squished baby food mack n cheese, applesauce ( be funny and get the strawberry one to throw them off with the color. ) the best one is honey mustard and put sun flower seeds and the correct answer to that one would be that the baby ahd breast milk since that is what the babys poop looks like when they are breast fed. i came up with that idea and hardly anyone ahs ever been able to figure that one out except for the ones that have recently had breastfed babies.     then there is the clothes clip game everyone gets 1 clothes pin when they come in the door and anytime someone catches anyone saying baby they can get their clothes pin the one with the most clothe spin s at the end of the shower gets the final gift of the day.     as far as food we just had finger foods like sandwiches cut in half. rolled up meat on tooth picks and cheese on tooth picks, crackers, chips and fruit and veggies with dips, punch, cake icecream, sodas etc we did not do any alcohol.  in my experience co ed showers are much more fun than only female showeres since most men will come up with some crazy answers for some of the games.   hope this helps if you need any other ideas email me i can come up with many more     also get them to guess hwo many squares of toilet paper it takes to wrap around your belly|`|VlBX8ATYaa	Oh yes, check out...    http://www.zuzunee.com    good luck :)|`|fjeFBGlqaa	well there's a fun game where you take string and have everybody try and guess how big your belly is!!! its alot of fun!
YqeatZB4aa	It is possible that you are pregnant. My friend had 7 false negatives. Take another test in a few weeks. good luck.|`|l7awD5mcaa	Going to the doctor to get an official test will help you with that. Sometimes hometests aren't always 100% correct.|`|eemmWU0Haa	If its - then No, your not pregnant plain and simple|`|KMtd5gr0aa	i was told u have 2 be 2 weeks or more 4 a home test 2 pick up. U must not b pregnant!|`|7WvWa08Oaa	i'd say to wait another week or two and take another test, or go to your doctor and get a blood test because it'll detect the hormones sooner|`|luKyK3Duaa	wait another week and try another test, if not see your doctor.    you could be pregnant or you may not be, it sounds like you could be but when i was ttc i had a lot of the symptoms sometimes but it was only me wishing it could be true, all da best xx

Evmgd3p2aa	Well i have discovered in the last week to use the blow-drier alot to my advantage (ughh, my parents took my straightener and curling iron away) but anywayy, if you want it to look cute/healthy/bouncy use your blow drier and a curling brush.

8THz1sp9aa	When I had my first ultrasound at 10 weeks, my docter told me that my baby looked a little large. The second ultrasound was at 17/18 weeks and they told me my baby weighed 10.6 oz. which the average is 9.5 oz. but they didn't change my due date. I have been wondering myself if I am further along than I really think I am, because my mom had her period till almost 4/5 months of being pregnant with me. I guess when the baby decides to come popping out we will know for sure haha! Just don't worry too much and be greatful we've been given such a gift. Congrats by the way & I wish you the best of luck.|`|tAEmJZCtaa	I just had my 18 week ultrasound last Wednesday. My baby weighed 8.5 oz., and the ultrasound showed that I was 18 weeks and 3 days. That was right on track. I think 17 or 18 weeks is a little bit too much for you to be. My baby is 5 inches, and I'm that far along. When I went in for my 15 week appointment, they measured my stomach and I was 17 cm. I thought I was much farther along too, but the dr. didn't change my due date. Anyway, to answer you question I wouldn't worry really about it. The civilian drs know much more than the military midwives that I see. So, I think they know what they are talking about, Congrats on your baby though! Best of luck to you!
a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	If you have to question whether or not you are even ready to have sex, you are definitely NOT ready.  When you are ready there will be no doubt in your mind; your heart and mind will know that the time is right and you will be completely in love with the man that you are going to share such an intimate moment with.  If you believe that being pure until marriage is important, honor that belief and value; once you do it, you cannot ever undo it!  The longer you wait, the more you trust the man you want to be with, the more in love you two are, the better it will be!|`|d5K8wORqaa	when you dont have to ask this question|`|kMiq1wqpaa	when you're married.|`|2lMP6ow1aa	Do not put yourself in situations that will allow it. I had sex at a very very young age. Not only did I feel that I had disappointed God but also myself and later my parents when they found out about it. Thank God I did not get pregnant at the age of 13 when it did happen! Just hold out and don't give in. You will be proud of yourself in the long run.|`|3bQaEVmTaa	I FEEL THE SAME WAY GIRL.

Save yourself for marriage, it's like a gift to your husband.|`|3mnYzbPVaa	You're acknowledging you're young. Wait until you're old enough to move out of your parent's house. Your conception of love will change continuously throughout your life, so give it some time. I say out of your parent's house because   a) Tacky.   b)you're likely not ready to make decisions from circumstances that can arise from sex,   c) you acknowledge that while you really really love him, you could really REALLY fall in love. You don't want there to be any regrets. Give it a little bit more time.    I want to skip the God question as I can't empathize, but I think it's safe to say that you shouldn't be having sex until you understand the actual philosophy behind waiting for sex in your religion. If you're Christian, sex is wrong unless you are using it for procreative purposes, and you clearly aren't doing that if you're young. If you disagree with that statement, you should be re-evaluating the sex issue as well as your religious beliefs.
0JBXD87uaa	If she misses too much school, she will fail. Let her know that sometimes you have to go in to work when you are a bit sick. School is her job right now so the same rules apply. In the end it's your decision, but after a certain point you can only keep her out with doctor notes and that gets expensive. My mother made me go unless I was pale, burning, or close to throwing up.  Now that I'm in college and make my own decisions about attendance, I realize that lesson was best since I have gone in when I feel horrible just to pound the info into my head so that I can do well. I know I cant pass if I don't go to class, and the sooner I get out the better!  Lying is the tough part. That takes practice. I haven't lied much, but I have a strong relationship with my mom and usually end up telling the truth. Wish I could help more on that front.|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Go to the child's dr for an appointment.  Very likely there is some reason for the sickness (allergies which do cause early morning sickness due to sniffles draining at night).  Tell the Dr about the constant sickness, the Dr will ask the child some questions about what might be bothering her at school or home.|`|lvfPrS6saa	Sometimes its impossible.There are little signs,that's unique to individual people.My daughter who is 15 and a regular basis liar slightly catches her breath after she lies.My dads is real obvious he can't help but rub his chest as he's lying.You need to watch for ever so slight behavior changes when you suspect a lie.But don't let her know EVER what you're doing,then she can watch as well and try to stop.Become a better liar.  Also I can almost guarantee she gets defensive when she's lying.You never trust me!That kind of thing.  If I can, I try not to give them the choice to lie.If you no the truth,don't ask the question.|`|U1ku2k4Naa	Well, I know when my brothers or me were sick when we were younger, we would be allowed to stay home sick if we had a fever and was throwing up.  We are older, and sometimes my brother doesn't want to school, it's easy to tell.  Then I am the person who doesn't like to miss school, so when I am not feeling well I am usually allowed to stay home (but I still try to go, sometimes I go home at lunch)    As for the lying, it's hard to tell.  Some people are just easy to read, and some are not.|`|vp1K0bxwaa	I have bad allergies in the winter/springtime because of the dry weather and everything coming back to life, and my nose is sometimes runny/sneezy in the early morning. My mom tells me I can stay home when she can TELL I look like crap- dark bags under my eyes, sometimes a fever, coughing, sneezing, sometimes sore throat, I have an EXTREMELY hard time getting up...    I would take her to the doctor to be sure of whats going on, she may be seriously sick, she may have allergies or she could be faking it.|`|5ShEGzSKaa	My mom sends me to school even if I'm sick. I was throwing up in the car and my mom toldme I had 5 min to get to class. When I ws sick in th nurses office I called and she yelled at he nurse and told me to suck it up and go to class. I say tell her she has to go to school anyway
Kh5o3QCcaa	I always rub it on the neck and chest, under the nose (for sinus issues), and on the bottoms of the kids' feet.      Also the Babies Vicks is much lighter than regular vick's, so don't worry about it being too much or too strong.  I think the one I picked up was lavender scented?  Whatever it was it smelled nice.      Haha, basically a good all around lathering =0]    Update:    As for the article below.... there are studies that suggest being born is hazardous to the health of a child.  It's traumatizing and they are exposed to all sorts of scary things.      This Mom wasn't asking whether or not she should use it, she asked where to use it.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Put it on his chest and on his lower back.|`|KWelUnSOaa	When I used Vicks baby rub on my nephew i rubbed it on his belly and chest. I also would give him a bath in the vapor bath|`|lCwjDDcoaa	When My daughter was very young and I had to use it, I would put it on her pj's right under the neck line, not a lot though, since its so strong.     Hope your baby gets better quick!!|`|NiVOpxYAaa	I just saw on the news last week not to put Vick's under the nose.  This actually causes more mucous.  We always rubbed it on the chest.  But rubbing on the feet stops coughing.
S9eySgjyaa	Babies that young can't over eat. They only eat as much as they need, I have read that in a lot of parenting magazines and my sons doctor said the same thing. Too bad adults weren't like that. Let her tell you her eating habits.
2QejTvhEaa	plz make it clear.. m nt getting wat u r asking.|`|lhn1wNoeaa	wait for it|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Just wait and see.|`|AA11185897	What has the doctor said about the lack of fetal heart beat? was it maybe that the baby was in a position that made them unable to hear it?     Did the doctor tell you to prepare yourself for the loss of your baby?|`|xBW4saqgaa	your question is not clear
AA11185897	Depending on the length of your cycle...    assuming 28 days... on days about 9-14 you can get pregnant as sperm stays in there for a number of days waiting for Ovulation. so that would mean that from about Dec 27 threw Jan 1st or so. that makes it J if you are pregnant, HOWEVER, it is always possible to have conceived at anytime.   But my best guess for you would be J. even if your cycle varies from the 28 days i still think that most likely the days you were most fertile fall when you were with J.|`|lhn1wNoeaa	no idea|`|GalBwrwOaa	i really do not know.  I guess you will have to have a dna test|`|pUnjP0Jyaa	okay first off you dont even kno if your pregnant umm go take a test than after you do that and its positive wait ithink 18wks and get blood done for both men but if its negative how about you stick to one man or the other cus its sad wen you have to question your babies father honestly trust me i kno!|`|eemmWU0Haa	AH Do you even know if your pregnant or not?...test first and if you get a + then you can worry about who is the father!|`|bPZGSd8Raa	Well if you have all those signs and your still getting negatives then your best bet would to just go to a doctor and get a blood test done just to be safe that your not in any danger even if your not pregnant.  Starting eating good, relaxing and just taking it easy. Dont worry just make an appointment.
6avKnzkoaa	The baby is well cushioned and protected inside their sac inside of you, so they should be okay. As long as you don't start cramping/bleeding. However, if you're concerned, go see the doctor, they'll probably give you an ultrasound to reassure you or give you a check over. =]|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	don't worry...my four year old accidently punched and kicked my tummy a couple of times and it didn't harm my twins....they even kicked and punched him back!!  if you start bleeding or start being in pain though, definatly call your doctor.
CZwJJetyaa	Not supposed to, but I would go to my gyn, there might be a risk of endoscopic pregnancy. And that would be very bad.  Good luck.
5q9xcYAuaa	Yes! Good chance the 1 day thing was just implantation. The timing would add up right for implantation. Or could just be an off-cycle this month.
1FXXJMy5aa	I love Noelle (this spelling) Elizabeth.  Jacent is uncommon but very cute too!|`|bpyx92GZaa	Noelle Elizabeth is beautiful. Noel is for a boy :o)    Jacent sounds nice, I never heard of it but its cute...:o)|`|UspK4SQBaa	I like Noelle Elizabeth|`|m3iPgBWFaa	they are cute a Noel|`|42cQpxviaa	I LOVE those names. They're really unique, good job. Except the name Jacent kind of makes me think of the word adjacent, like next-to. But it's okay, cute names. And stick with Noelle. That's the better way of spelling it; i think Noel is a boy's name.    Oh, and you might want to look up what those names actually mean. Because it could be a pretty name but mean "dictator" or something. :)|`|fvwLFWqwaa	theyre cute. spell them very unike so nobody has a name liek them but then everybody likes the name|`|okgr5aPCaa	I think Noel is more of the boy way of spelling it (and I'm assuming its said different to the guy version of the name... more like no-ELL... whereas the boy version is more kinda like Nole in a way...)    So I'd say Noelle would be a better way to spell it.|`|hFgAr7vNaa	i think people r gonna tease the boy    and the girl is noelle|`|NoZAofgOaa	i love the girl name.   and i like Noelle.|`|4TNavgDuaa	Noelle|`|fZCfJWpOaa	Pretty!    I like Noelle for the spelling of the girl name.  Personally I find that spelling more feminine.|`|IcxoK6j4aa	i like noelle better and thank god....i thought it was pronounced jacket!! but i like it cute and not common and i love names like that|`|qXq0nmBzaa	Jacent is terrible. Jacenty is a Polish name for the flower name of hyacinth. It's awfully girly. Even more, when I hear Jacent, I hear the word "adjacent" (close to). I'd certainly pick something else. This name is a loser. How many times a day will the child have to spell, pronounce, explain? You already felt you had to explain before anyone had even answered!    Alexander is fine.    Noelle is the feminine form of the man's name Noel. If you're having a girl, it would be wise and considerate to use the feminine spelling.  Noel is usually pronounced NO-el while Noelle is no-ELL.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	Jacent - like Adjacent?  Nope.  I don't like it.    The girl spelling of Noel is Noelle.

They are both unique without being weird. I especially like Jacent, I have never heard that name before but it sounds cool. I like the girls name spelt Noelle, I think it looks more interesting.|`|Im5bwWawaa	I think that both the names are really nice, I thinku should spell the name like this: Noelle because I think that it is  more girly.|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	Noelle. without the elizabeth.  Jacent reminds me of pennies.  or you could be totally wierd and copy that one couple and name your kids aryan nation or hitler or something...|`|24P6A0oaaa	noelle is beautiful! that would be my choice if I was having a girl!  the boy name is okay, its unique|`|HcxaErXkaa	i like noelle! and i think you should spell it that way! :)|`|J33QFBozaa	I dont like them, too long and when he grows up he is going to hate when people who cant pronounce his name, and noel, did u santa in spanish is Papa Noel, go for Roman or Mika if hes a boy, i think they sound amazing and they are different, and if shes a girl Isabella, all the girls I know with that name are beautiful, or Annaliese..
RrPjG9x9aa	women can only get pregnant when they are *fertile*, which is usually closely associated with, but not the same as, ovulation.  A woman's egg can live anywhere from 6 - 24 hours.  A mans sperm can live anywhere from 2 - 5 days.  Add all that up and there's usually a good solid 3-4 day "fertile period" leading up to and including the day of ovulation.|`|1eLZ3Bejaa	No. Just better chances if they are.

oZdIsSSEaa	It sounds like you are going through a difficult time, but the fact that you are so concerned speaks volumes about the love and support you have to give you son.  Regardless of what the tests show, you are going to love him and you can find a support system who will help you through it.  I have a friend whose daughter was born with severe disabilities. At first she was stressed, worried, sad, etc. but it is amazing to see what love has allowed her to do. In two years she is raising a child who is so happy and loved, and it has allowed her to grow as a mother too.  There is a quote from the Baha'i writings that I always think about when I am being tested:  "Nothing save that which profiteth them can befall My loved ones.'  I don't know if you are spiritual at all, or believe in God, but basically this reminds us that everything happens to us for a reason, and the fact that you are going through this is making you a stronger mother.  Best wishes.|`|JyvG8dFcaa	i will keep you in my prayers tonite...he should be ok since it is correctable with physical therapy...
ZrKGtvthaa	I think the test was faulty, I would suggest taking another one.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	What kind of test did you take? I mean brand wise?|`|eemmWU0Haa	Re test in the morning it was probably done wrong.  Good Luck|`|urrmckQBaa	sounds like a faulty test, the dye would have flooded the background and the line would be the test line which if pos would glow up. You cannot take it as a reliable answer. Test again using a new test :)|`|3AjAswkWaa	buy another pregnancy test and take it first thing in the am...make sure you follow the directions|`|b3EH4JPqaa	the pink background shouldnt been showing, the best thing you can do is repeat the test you dont want to have any wrong answer,    it should be white background and pink lines.|`|2RsCIdYcaa	The best thing to do is take another one. You may of urinated too long on it or it could be a fault with the test but take another one.|`|dvoelIXIaa	Weird if I were you I just go back to the store and get a different one.

HypqcnJaaa	OMG I'VE ALWAYS LOVED RYANN FOR GIRLS!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU ROCK!  Kiah's really nice too (Pronounced Kayah). Rose would go well too, I know it's a bit common but it sounds pretty. Or Skye. :)|`|AA11138222	I like Kesley better than Brynlee, but it would probably get pronounced Kelsey a lot, cause Kelsey is a common name. I'm not fond of any of the middle names...    Brynlee Justine  Brynlee Maylin (MAY-lin)  Brynlee Nicolette  Brynlee Noelle    I hate to say it, but I think Brynlee Nicole flows really well!|`|EFlX4GYOaa	Finlee|`|pvabglXhaa	I don't like Reece as it's the name of a huge chain of plumbing stores in Australia.    I think Kai is the best one.    My own suggestion would be Rose, I know it's old fashioned but still a nice name.|`|9mSIQA2Baa	Brynlee is such a cute name but I prefer the spelling Brynlie. Here are some midle name suggestions:  Brynlee Claire  Brynlee Kay  Brynlee Hope  Brynlee Grace  Brynlee Larissa  Brynlee Kendall  Brynlee Emma  Brynlee Rylie  Brynlee Nicole   Brynlee Sophie|`|bT4npA7Jaa	How about Kesley Reece. I think that is a really cute name and very unique. I know a girl named Chesley, not Chelsey. It's a common mistake anyone can make, but I like yours better. Or Kesley Braelyn. Hm. Kesley Sophia, Kesley Reagan, Kesley Cherish (My sister has a friend named Cherish). Those were just my favorite names used a middle ones. I hope I helped :)|`|sPl34hzWaa	i love Reece!|`|JpH3Mlrhaa	Reese,,  it flows well.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Hope is my favorite, but I also like Kai and Gracelyn.  :)      ETA:  I love the name Brynlee.  I've never heard it before, but I think it's gorgeous!|`|173vsiacaa	brynlee kes  brynlee rae    of the middle names you have,  brynlee kai is good, considering that it very K-like, and her brother's name is kaleb, and you originally wanted kesley  brynlee hope is good too|`|eAxQxkA2aa	I`m sorry, but the name Brynlee reminds me of brine shrimp when I say it.|`|R9AAhsIjaa	I like Brynlee Kate..is that too common? I think it's so classic and pretty. (My baby is Zoe Kate!) Plus it's short enough to monogram on everything!    Although, I don't think you can go wrong with Hope. What a sweet name :o)|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	What about just Brynn Leigh? Make it 2 names.   If you are going to go with Brynlee don't make the middle name a compound name too like Gracelyn.|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Oh gosh please not Paislyn...|`|tvOAeGAnaa	Do you want your child to be ridiculed? Brynlee??? No way, try to change that around a little bit if you could. Make it the middle name if it's senitmental to you.     Reece is nice  Hope  Grace|`|gbAZKiLyaa	I know a Brynlee Elise and I think that is a cute combo. The only one on your list that "flows" to me is Brynlee Hope. I think that is cute!

QsbB6vkoaa	WOW!! your story is very sad, and even though i've never been through this i can assure you i understand you. i think that you don't need your mom, and you should prove her wrong, you should succeed all by yourself. call your dad from another place and if you don't feel comfortable in your home stay with a friend until he can come pick you up. but make sure to do thing right, when he comes for you don't just leave like that, because she can call the police. go to the court house and explain to them what's going on and how your life is just getting worst by her side.  and when you get to your new home and to your new school , go to the counselor right away to see if they can get you some treatment or something and try to make  your life a very success full one.  good luck.|`|LynprVLYaa	Go to a friends house and call. Or the neighbor's house.
PDHCOrOSaa	I am a very realistic person so I will probably be having the sex talk young.  I had sex ed in school when I was in 4th grade ( 9 years old ).  I didn't understand it all because I don't believe sex ed should talk about uterus's and Fallopian tubes...I think it should talk about consequences.  I would love Grandchildren someday ( I'm only 25 now LOL ) but anyway I want my daughter to wait till she's in a steady, healthy relationship and financially secure so she can comfortably be able to provide for herself and her child.<br>  <br>  There are so many disgusting STD's out there as well and hopefully I can scare my daughter into waiting till she's with the right person in an exclusive relationship.  Believe me I'm the type of person that will google pics of syphilis just to scare her straight! LOL.....funny but true.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	you can get books to help you discuss sex in a healthy way with children of almost any age.  I think it is better to ease them into it than to have one great big overwhelming talk at nine or ten years old.  I certainly wouldn't wait any later than nine or ten if you want to be there first source for this information. In some communities, even less.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	these days, sex is brought up at such an early age, its ridiculous. i have a ten year old nephew who knows about sex. he came home from school and asked my sister to explain things for him. i had no idea what sex was when i was ten, much less fifteen or so!<br>  but based on how society is, i'd talk to the kids early.. it's ridiculous, but the way the world is. i honestly dont know a good age, there's no right answer. just use your best judgement. also with her being only a year, things may change quickly in the next few years, as they have in the last.<br>  i find it highly hilarious that mens health was suggested for this =]|`|n3IoftMFaa	Haha - honey, you don't have much time at all. She is 13 - the average age to lose it is 16. She could go sooner. Have it now, build up a trust and don't be judgemental.<br>  <br>  Better she come to you to get on the pill than to tell you she is pregnant.<br>  <br>  OH! Hahah! Sorry, I read 13 years!|`|ybl8u6SVaa	I am a 14 year old boy and i would say that you should talk to your kid right before going into middle school. Before that I didn't even know what sex really was and i really didn't want to have it. It all depends on when she will go threw puberty.|`|AIwDdAKcaa	the earlier the better. seriously.|`|15qceXaOaa	wow u plan in advance big time|`|s4LWmcTjaa	When ever they start asking questions.  Just be sure to give age appropriate answers.  Now would be a good time to talk.  She's a teenager so she will start having more questions soon.  Keep the lines of communication open.  Here's some good resources:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://christianteens.about.com/od/whatthebiblesaysabout/f/Sex.htm" rel="nofollow">http://christianteens.about.com/od/whatt...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://christianteens.about.com/od/dating/tp/liessexdating.htm" rel="nofollow">http://christianteens.about.com/od/datin...</a><br>  <br>  For the poster who says the average teen "loses it" by age 16:  Um well I didn't.  I was married and 20 years old when I had sex for the first time.  My parents raised to believe that sex was for marriage.  To be honest just the thought of possibly becoming pregnant, to know that there was no 100% gguarantee that contraceptives would prevent pregnancy, was enough to keep my pants on!|`|gx4s68s8aa	I think it is an ongoing talk.  It starts with the simple thing about naming the body parts.  Then it slowly develops into that babies come from mommies bellies.  Sex should not be one talk but dozens.  And as they get older and want and need to know more, you add to the discussion.<br>  <br>  My daughter is two, but she know her body parts and we tell her that babies come from mommies belly with the help of a daddy.|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	It should be done now. I think I was about 10 the first time me and my mum had a chat and then again when I was a bit older. My mum did it because we start sex ed in school at 10 so she wanted to get in a bit before them. In this day and age when kids are having there own kids at 12 then I think that around about 10 is a reasonable age. You don't need to be too detailed at that point just an overview and then you can discuss it again later. also if you start young then hopefully your daughter will be able to come and talk to you at any time without feeling embarassed cos some poeple aren't that lucky.<br>  <br>  That said I am only talking about it from a hearing point of view I have no kids so have never had to do the telling.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Honestly since girls are menstruating earlier and earlier every year I would say give her the talk around 8 or 9, at least so she can be aware and get the news from you and not her classmates.<br>  <br>  <<<Dreading the day I have to have the talk with my children.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	Umm....I think now would be a good time.|`|sxecXFgraa	The sooner the better.  My kids are 7 and 10 and I started talking to them a couple of years ago.
Jo2DfRzaaa	I hate these recalls.  I'm still not over the spinach one for a couple of years back.  I love spinach - fresh.  It freaked me out for a long time. I've only made it once since the recall.  How sad is that.    I do like PB and jelly sandwiches though.  something very familar about them.  of course I only eat strawberry jelly.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	I'v heard that as of right now the jarred peanut butter is okay.    I had a sandwich last night ( peter pan ) brand new jar and I'm fine.|`|AA12221392	banned it all, just to be on the safe side....     Gave the kids a strict do not eat anything that may be peanuts, peanut butter at this point. ...    It is killing them though the youngest loves peanut butter..|`|J3TRJPIwaa	Actually the jarred peter pan peanut butter and walmarts great value peanut butter are recalled to. My choice would be no M&M's...    EDIT: Sorry to freak you out! Here is the link to the recall.   http://investor.conagrafoods.com/phoenix...    Oh, I also wanted to add that my husband has had symptoms of salmonella for about a week now. We had the walmart peanut butter here at home and he had one at work - they have both been thrown out. I can't say for sure that he had salmonella but normal food poisoning doesn't last a week...thank goodness he is getting better!|`|5D0KuT74aa	yes  my son is allergic|`|zxaqL885aa	um WHAT?  that was very confusing to read.   about the M&M's...if peanut butter is being recalled why would you not want to eat the M&M's? i realize that PB is made from peanuts but the outbreak probably started in the PB factory not in the peanuts its self.  and no i haven't banned peanut butter or anything. i didn't even hear of an outbreak.   is that in the US? cuz im in Canada...|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	i agree with you on the peanuts/peanut butter thing.  I banished it all from the house because I live near where it happened and I don't want to take a chance.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I ban peanut butter from my house anyway. But eat the M&M's!|`|prqrQcd1aa	I am not giving anyone any peanut butter products right now, except those in the jar... jiff jar that is. We may find out that it is in there too at some point, but right now, it seems pretty contained to other things.|`|5p7gpj36aa	Not the jar.. but I threw away my peanut butter crackers! All those deaths is too much for me.|`|r9gBoBLCaa	Why would I do that?  Has there been some peanut disease outbreak?|`|hGmq5IuZaa	we eat all natural organic foods..we dont have to worry about that. Our peanut butter is ground by me. I'd be more worried about the fats preservatives and cornsyrup they put in factory made processed food than salmonella..because that is always in it|`|RxDUl6tvaa	Are you talking about the salmonella thing?.. No i wouldn't ban anything except for the peanut butter crackers because thats were they found the salmonella in..  Hope i could help|`|4iXL4C6paa	eat em|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	No.  I only banned what was recalled...and the only thing I had here that was recalled was the Austin brand PB crackers.    I bought a package of Lance PB crackers (since they put out a statement saying theirs tested safe and comes from a different source than the tainted stuff) and still eating out of my jar of Peter Pan.  I'm a peanut butter addict.  Mmmm...I'd be seriously tempted by those M&Ms too.    *I almost had a melt down when I read that Peter Pan was recalled.  I double checked the FDA and Peter Pan site...they are safe.  After that big recall they had about a year ago, they better play it safe!|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Just because one person at work gets a cold, it doesn't mean every single employee should stop going to work.    You're over doing it.|`|I2e4LFF9aa	well, ive never had it in my home. Its lazy man's food. no worries here!|`|oyvRHQmaaa	The salmonella problem was traced to a processing problem....You can get salmonella from a variety of foods...I'm not worrying about it...|`|jlrfkXj2aa	well so far I just banned everything.. and it sucks because somehow in doing that I developed a craving for PB!!! Plus I eat Fiber One bars that are oats and PB. I miss those, stupid PB!!!       I'm just too scared to risk it.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Yes, I would rather not take chances.|`|6433147ab9f09717fe7b72b8c66ba504aa	haha nope  i'm actually eating peanut butter crackers right now  i don't have salmonella :)|`|hl5WdXnbaa	No I have not... if I banned every food that has a problem once in a while there would be no food left in the cupboards! There was also recent bans on canned juice, strawberries and a type frozen veggies! I just make sure I have none of the recalled product  but I will not ban all peanut products.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I have a can of jiff from 4 months ago, I think that's in the safe range, right? Someone please confirm that.    Other than that, we aren't crazy for peanuts, so although we aren't avoiding it, we aren't buying any either.    Should we have more of an attachment to it, so we can better feel it's loss?    EDIT: lol thanks for the heads up, do you guys want to form  a support group in the meantime? Somebody said something about organic...maybe you can get organic peanuts? Oo0oh and if you get bored you could stomp your own peanut butter :)|`|UUpsa35Daa	I haven't eaten any kind of peanut product except jarred since i read about it in the news. But i haven't heard anything about peanut m&m's being affected. I think you should be fine... But considering, it's you taking the risk, you should probably be the one to make the final decision...haha.|`|VClxXNs3aa	no - and are you talking about peanuts or peanut butter? I'm confused.....|`|nrqWwQBXaa	not to be rude but if i quit eating every thing that was recalled i would starve. they have recalled so many foods. i watch what i eat but no i am not going to throw out all my food. sorry?
Ep0CpwDbaa	Personally, I would spell it Charleigh -- I think that looks adorable, and very feminine. But Charlee definitely does look more feminine than Charlie; I would go with that.

I would rethink it.|`|b7smO9h1aa	If i had to pick it would be Charlie because it looks better written down but Charlee does make it look more feminine.

AA10754660	we're about the same weeks (im 24 weeks and 6 days)  i have the same thing as you with the clear jelly discharge, its nothing to worry about its probably just leukorrhea. As for the pressure, i thought i was going to die with the pressure ive been getting in my pelvic area, its sooo painful, i went to the walk in today just to get it checked out and it turns out pressure in the stomach is just pressure pains...nothing to worry about but if i want to help it try exercising more and getting up slowly. That's what the doctor said...but im not going to exercise cause im a lazy butt ;) lol  you didn't say where your pressure was but i hope this helped!      i noticed not alot of people know what leukorreah is, its a clear jelly discharge that sometimes comes out in large quantities (maybe a teaspoon full) and its completly normal, its a pregnancy thing :)  i have it and its annoying but its nothing to stress about unless it has a funny odour and its green or yellow|`|200ymAwmaa	sounds to me that your baby moving around. clear discharge is ok.. mucus color would be something to worry about.. that's the color of your plug.. when the baby grows more and has less room.. his/her movement will hurt more.   my son used to kick the hell out of me. toward the last month i couldn't wait for him to be born, but then again i was very nervous.   congratulations and good luck! ^_^|`|bLplapNIaa	You are most likely experiencing Braxton Hicks or what is known as false labor. The discomfort is usually described as crampy or abdominal tightness and is usually in the abdomen whereas true contractions radiate from your back. This false labor has an irregular contraction pattern and is usually ineffective in causing cervical changes. I would say go to sleep for now and alert your doctor tmw about these experiences as I think 25 weeks is a little early to be experiencing Braxton Hicks.|`|YKeF3FyBaa	probably false labor  most likely braxton hicks  but if you are young there is a chance they need to admit you to stop contractions  Im 20 and i was admitted 4 times for false labor and they had to keep me until the contractions stopped  it's something you can wait to see until the doctor   unless they are really painful  they will probably say it's just "round ligament" pains  i freakin hated that when i was pregnant  they don't take you seriously until around 30 weeks with labor pains|`|GZrR0uxjaa	these could just be braxton hicks contractions, they can start around this time, its just your body getting ready for the real thing....if they are coming along regularly then you should be worried...but if they are just all over the place then its most likely normal....but just ask your doctor....good luck!|`|A5KbJEH1aa	They could be braxton hicks contractions,  they are heaps common in pregnancy anywhere after 20 weeks.    But the discharge has got me stomped..  I don't think its normal..  I dead set think you should go to the hopsital..  Better to be safe then sorry..|`|Y3Y45d4oaa	I am 30 weeks and have been dealing with the same thing for the past few days, i had a drs appt on monday, they did an exam and found it was just discharge, and i was expierencing braxton hicks, however mine were verrrry pain full as if real contractions. as long as it isnt WATER coming out, then you should be ok. Make sure you say something to your dr tomorrow though she will do something along the lines of a pap smear to make sure you havent ruptured any membranes and will probably do an ultrasound to make sure the fluid around the baby is alright.   Good luck hun. and congrats on your pregnancy.|`|PymLdXM8aa	well braxton hicks usually starts at about 20 weeks... so as long as yours are not painful then i wouldn't worry. Now the clear jelly stuff confuses me because i had that also at about 8 mths... but i dont think i ever lost my plug and never went into labor because my daughter was breached. So i am still not sure what that was all about but i would do some research hun. And maybe call your doctor in the morning, but i wouldn't waste my time in the ER for them to tell you that its nothing. GL :)
iNtPA7X9aa	she knows she's being an idiot and is embarrassed.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	yes<br>  har<br>  har<br>  har|`|DOM7UudCaa	she's a scared little *****. you should go fight the ho.|`|0kIwehVbaa	She is jealous of you!!<br>  :)|`|9zwSclnLaa	I don't see the irony, but I guess it's weird?|`|n3IoftMFaa	That isn't the definition of irony.
DuCxFQywaa	your baby is pretty small still and is very protected in your body. if your still not having pain then im sure your fine. but it never hurst to hear that from a doctor. i would lay on your back and push on the spot where it hit u and see if it is tender and see if it stays tender for a few days. if so go to the doctor if not, then im sure it didnt do anything!|`|NPmRmnG6aa	If you are really worried about it call your OB.|`|cWP73qEsaa	depends on where cuz when ur 10 weeks or so the baby is still located just under the top or your vagina you know the top of the v zone it starts to go up as the weeks pass but if you are scared go to the doc as soon as possible|`|wAPZ1vrTaa	i think you're going to be okay but you could call your dr an check, jus to make sure.
UcgWrGaAaa	Funny thing about OBs is that you barely see them except to catch the baby.  Strangers delivered all of my babies.  It's really the nurses who watch over you during your labor.    Something about being a mama makes a woman powerful.  When you are giving birth it is probably the most powerful experience you can have.  I found my births empowering because I had to stand up for myself and my baby. If they offer you a c-sec and the baby is in distress you have every right to ask lots of questions and to have them explain everything to you until you are convinced that it is the right thing for you and your baby.      The biggest thing you can do to avoid a c-sec is to make sure the baby is in the right position in the weeks before birth, not only head down but vertex, meaning that you want the babies spine just to the side of your belly button.  You have to get on your hands and knees and do the yoga position, the cat to get the heaviest part of the baby (his spine) to be forward near your belly button, you have to hump and arch your back about 30 reps 3 times a day.  Many birthing complications are due to the baby being in the wrong position.    Have you taken a birthing class?  Do you have a birth partner?  A doula would be best, someone to help you in labor if you feel that you need it.  But like I said, you are at your most powerful as a mama protecting and birthing your baby.  You are going to do just fine.      Read Spiritual Midwifery    Birthing From Within    A Good Birth A Safe Birth    Preparing your mind is some of the most important preparation you are going to do.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	No one can force a C-section on you.  If its not medically necessary, then you can simply refuse.  Also, no doctor would recommend a C-section for their own conveniences.  It goes against all ethical practices.  Also, there are lots of other staff involved that wouldn't allow a doctor to schedule it if there weren't clear signs of a medical emergency.  I think you are being just a bit paranoid.  Just simply speak to the doctor that you do like.  Express your desire that she be the one that delivers you.  Surely you'll be able to work something out.    That being said, you will most likely get to the hospital and spend your entire labor dealing with nurses and doctors that are staffed by the hospital that you've never seen in your entire life.  Its not until closer to delivery that your normal OB is called into the room.|`|FSPAKELyaa	im 32 weeks,i know how you feel. i have to go to a hosp clinic frequently, weekly now, and i there is only one dr i have seen twice, the rest are all new faces at each appt. its awful they keep giving me different answers to the same questions and i have no idea who will deliver my baby. although it is comforting to get to know the person who will be delivering, i try to think that baby will be here just the same, no matter who is there in the room :)  good luck|`|AA11820380	I would never go with a women doctor. I feel more comfortable with men doctors. You just really need to pick one quick. 35 weeks is a long time to not know what doctor you like. Honestly, not to be mean but what have you been doing this whole time to make a decision now? You had 30 weeks prior to this, why didn't you think about this before? You only have a bout 4 more visits. I changed doctors when i was 13 weeks because i wasn't comfortable with my first, I didn't wait til I was about to deliver. Luckily my doctor has his own practice so there is only him. It's the same doctor who delivered my first born 13 years ago.    Edit: I understand why you gave me a thumbs down. Sorry, but I speak the truth. Seriously, why are you just now deciding on a doctor, when you had your whole pregnancy to find one and get comfortable with them?|`|Fx77zYhWaa	They won't force one on you.  If there's one you like and trust you could consider inducing when she;s oncall.  Try doing getting in some more appointments with the other doctors.  You may find yourself getting more comfortable with them once you get to know them.  Ask their position and make it clear in your birthing plan that a c-section is a last resort.    My practice had four awesome doctors.  Unfortunately they keep leaving.  My first main OB left to have a baby and be closer to her family and the doctor that did my post labor stuff (My baby couldn't wait for a doctor and got delivered by an RN) with my second baby went into his own practice.  Early on I was a little uneasy about delivering without my main doctor but met the other doctors and I felt a lot better.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey     what i reckon you should do is tell them  how you feel that you are uncomfortable. ask for the lady doctor.    they cant force on you. But its okay to be scared. ask mum to come back and help. they are our moms and always okay to help us. when we need help.    God bless x
Ectn7tkSaa	Well I would say no to that as my friend is up to her 3rd pregnancy and the last one was a girl and this one is a girl and she was fine each time...actually she was sick once when she was pregnant with the boy!|`|sOgLLlDraa	sorry...there is no special symptoms to go by in regards to the sex of a baby. I had morning sickness with my first son and all day sickness with my second son. Your just going to have to hang in there until around 20 weeks and you get your ultrasound.     we have an old family tradition that is "suppose" to tell you the sex of the baby. you can try it for fun (only fun lol.)    you take a threaded needed and stick it into the eraser on a pencil.  You have someone hold the pencil above your wrist right below your hand. Dangle it there and it will spin and then if it goes up and down like fingers to elbow it is suppose to be a boy..side to side is suppose to be a girls.I have also seen people do it above there bellies also. Some women in my family swear by it.    Just don't take it too serious! It's fun  still though!!!|`|k9nLue0Uaa	I'm having a baby girl and had it terriiiiiibbbbbbbllllllyyy!!!!!!! i'm due may 8th and can't wait for her!|`|AnIgXRcJaa	It doesn't matter if you are having a boy or a girl to get morning sickness, what the heck? And it all depends on the person. Every one goes through different things and not all get morning sickness.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I had no morning sickness every, had two girls one boy. Both daughtes had bad morning sickness one had two boys and the other is having a boy.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I can tell you that I have 5 boys and only 1 girl. The only one I had morning sickness with was my daughter! Trust me I would deal with that again if I could just be 100% for sure it was a girl!!!!!!|`|etzhw4j7aa	nope my mom never had it with me|`|8YhITQ7laa	My aunt had 4 kids. 3 girls and then finally a boy. She was very sick on the 3 girls and the boy she wasn't sick at all. So for her it is opposite. I am having a boy and I was really sick. I have dicletion pills so I dont be sick now.|`|pp5dhbIoaa	I have 2 girls , never sick with either one. With my son I was sick as dog ALL the time.|`|AA11922229	Not everyone, only the pregnant women, regardless of the sex of the fetus.    Sometimes husbands get morning sickness, after watching their wife. Not every1, but many do get morning and all day sickness.|`|AKjME08Maa	hi im 34 weeks pregnant with my first. i was dying for a girl and i had morning sickness terribly bad. i use to get told i am most likley having a girl due to bad morning sickness, turns out im having a boy. but everyone's different. there's alot of "myths" on how to tell if your carrying a boy or girl. google some things and see if you match any with having a girl. good luck to you (:|`|mtDWu8sXaa	You are one of the lucky ones!  I have 2 girls, was a little sick with the first, a lot sick with the second and am pregnant (38 weeks along) with a boy, and WAS VERY sick!  It varies...some women are lucky and some aren't.....that's cute that he has the sickness and you don't.....there is an old wives tale, but don't let him know...if you cross over him in the mornings to get out of bed instead of him crossing over you in the mornings to get out of bed, he will be sick.  But don't let him know, cuz if he crosses over you you will get sick.  It's an old wives tale and I have heard it works...so just keep crossing him in the mornings! LOL.  Take care sweetie.  =) But don't fret if you get sick later on in the pregnancy, it can come really at any moments notice or sporadic bursts.  =)|`|FTW82Wumaa	My mom had some nausea with my sister and I but was so sick she had to be put on medication for my brother. My mother in law was just the opposite. Slight nausea with her boys and really really sick with her girl. It means nothing pertaining to the gender.|`|pfJorlTIaa	No, not everyone. my co-worker just had a girl the other day and she was not sick, not even once during her pregnancy.  I was sick all the time in the same way with my two boys and my one girl.  Good Luck.|`|f4Y4yWQ9aa	nope everyone is different.|`|ZPYCus4xaa	It varies for each individual.|`|yqvwuzBZaa	no|`|SRIaRm08aa	I am 10 weeks pg and have had no morning sickness.  I obviously do not know the sex of my baby yet but a friend of mine has a boy and girl and had no morning sickness with either pregnancy.  we are hoping for a girl as well. This is our first pregnancy.|`|QLkxGjFraa	realy? i thought you only get morning sickness after you give birth|`|oXG1GOPcaa	people are always sick when they are pregnant|`|HdFkShhFaa	my mom only had morning sickness one day with me and my dad was not to happy about it and i don't blame him considering it was his birthday....lol. but other then that she was fine, so i think it depends|`|AA12091210	Whatever sex your baby is has no bearing on whether you will get morning sickness or not, or any other particular symptoms or not.  Every pregnancy is different.  I haven't experienced any morning sickness at all.    Some women say they know when they are having a different sex than they have had before, because of different pregnancy symptoms.  But my aunt had four boys and each time she swore it was a girl because she had different symptoms, or carried differently, or had a different heart rate, or whatever.    I don't think it matters what symptoms you have - what will be will be!    Congratulations!
AA11763588	Do you plan on getting married anytime soon?    The military isn't going to pay for any of your medical needs and once the baby is born they won't pay for any of your child's needs unless you are married. I know you didn't really ask this, but being an Air Force wife, I figured I'd let you know.    You're going to have to tell your grandparents sooner or later, just be up front and open with them.    As for your PO, I'm pretty sure you can move as long as you give them the new address and phone number within a few days of moving.|`|rjVALevtaa	Wow, you're in a difficult situation for several reasons. You have a hard road ahead of you, but if you are determined to make it work you can!     I don't know what sort of area you live in but some areas (usually bigger cities) have special schools with programs for pregnant teens and teen moms. You should definitely look into it. I went to a school like that and had a very good experience. They had an on campus daycare and everything. If there isn't a school like this where you live, you should look into independent study (aka home schooling).    You should be honest with your grandmother. If she does kick you out at least you know you have another place to live. It sounds like your boyfriend's mom is very supportive, which is great.     I was a mother at 16 as well so I know what it is like. If you ever want to talk or have anymore questions my e-mail is on my profile. Good luck!|`|xAlTGs9Iaa	I am with a soldier, im 17, a mom, and might be pregnant again :) we are happily married now, pls IM me or email me at armyangyl@yahoo.com! im on IM right now! i can help you ALOT!|`|EOIxLhBxaa	just a thought, i know if you cheat in the military they kick you to the curb and can charge you with various things. How would they treat a guy who is impregnating underage girls?|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Congrats.................and best of luck.
5573832243a1d5e3f002d23bed5be490aa	One thing that worked when my nephew was the same way with the cough and runny nose was we would turn the bathtub water on or shower on as HOT as it would get (obviously NOT putting anyone INCLUDING my nephew in the water, just had to say that because some people will get rued and think we were burning my nephew) but any way turn the water on as hot as it will get, give it a few minutes to really steam up the bathroom...don't open anything to vent the bathroom out and take your baby in there and it on the toliet or floor with the baby in your lap...bring a toy or book something to keep him sitting still and let him just sit in their with you breathing in the moist warm air. I know this is like  the humidifier but it has alot more humidity. This will help with his cough.     For his runny nose they have a spray called "little Noses" it's wonderful and it used for runny noses for baby's my cousin swears by this for her 2 babies!    Also my Grandma always swore by putting vicks on the bottom of the foot and then putting socks on! Everytime one of us grandchildren would get sick they would make sure our feet, chest, and back were vicksed at all times!    Good luck, I hope he starts feeling better!|`|iOqmoIrcaa	Pedialyte is for diarrhea and vomiting, not a respiratory infection.  Holding him is the best treatment for a sick baby.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	That's all you can do.  Babies can't really take anything for colds.  As long as baby is having normal wet/dirty diapers, is staying hydrated, then thats it.  Don't worry it'll be over soon.  Just keep doing what your doing.  If it gets any worse call the pediatrician.      EDIT: pedialyte is used to hydrate baby, which can be for ALL sicknesses.|`|dBdQB4KHaa	Try putting a Tiny dab of vix on his upper lip I do this if its hard to breath and it avoids putting more chemical's in my body.|`|AA11920812	Your doing everything perfectly!    Just give him lots of extra love (and kiss those little cheeks while he still lets you!). When my youngest was six months and had the flu he lived off Gaterade for three long weeks. It really is good stuff. He survived and lost a bit of weight but remained at the top of his percentiles...and still does.    He will get better hang in there moma!    Edited to add:    To the person who said pedialyte is for stomach issues not respitory ones obviously has     1. never had kids  2. never had sick kids    Pedialyte and sports drinks are used to keep a baby hydrated when they won`t eat/drink anything else. Their body cannot function without proper nutrients -electorlytes are a huge part in keeping the body running. These are essentially salts that help you retain liquids in your body (water). You can also use kool-aid and bananas if your kids won`t do anything else (like my niece). Not what is preferred but it keeps them from becoming dehydrated and hooked up to an IV in the ER...|`|52U22fiAaa	Sounds good.  Just be sure to check his temperature when you change his diaper (rectal reading is most accurate).|`|rxk90e6Taa	If you are breast-feeding, try pumping a little milk, to drip it in his nose. This, in my experience is a more effective way to getting that snot out.     I read that you should not but Vicks or the Baby Rub on the face( like someone suggested). Just the neck, chest, back area. It sounds like you have things under control. Although I thought kids had to be a year old for Pedialyte.    Also try to keep his hands and face clean more often. I know with him being small everyone wants to hold him and be close to him. So protect him and tell the sick ones to limit their time with him. You could also buy those masks to go over the mouth and nose for those who have a cough. Maybe a little Clorox wipes to disinfect his toys that may be handled by the sick ones.    It just has to run its course. There aren't any cold medicines on the market for infants. Don't give him Triaminic(that's for older children) or any medicine period unless prescribed by Dr.|`|oJzMFaxuaa	It sounds like you're doing all you can, dear.  I think you just need to let time work things out.  I hope he feels better soon!|`|jkFZb2aYaa	sounds like you are doing a good job...add lots of tlc which i am sure you are!|`|2jnpvyzaaa	try childrens TRIAMINIC it realy worked 4 stuffy nose.there is this other brand called little noses.buy @ wall-mart|`|9iDhKZ1Oaa	You are doing every single thing you can do for an infant with a cold. Get the Little Noses Saline drops (they even make a spray now too) to spray in your son's nose before sucking it out. That will break up the mucous and make it easier to get it all out. They also make Vick's Vapor nightlight/plug-ins that emit the same vapors as the rub in the room while your baby is sleeping.  Also, for the cough, this sounds so strange but it WORKS! Before you put your little one to bed, rub the Vick's Baby Rub on the bottom of your baby's feet, and then put socks on them. It will help the cough during the night... don't know how it works, I read it on baby center, tried it when my son had a cold, and it really worked! So now I pass on the tip.    Good luck and I hope your little angel gets better SOON!|`|vrHeGvy2aa	You can also get saline drops to help thin the mucus in his nose so you can suck it out more easily.  I hope this helps.
7gfNIajYaa	No...your avatar is a boy...therefore...your not pregnant haha!|`|n24githIaa	No hunni. Sorry  Even if the doctors said you are now a woman (due to the sex change operation) you still can't have children.  You don't have the right reproductive parts.  Sorry.  *Virtual hug*|`|CN16uovuaa	And the answer is:                                 Du du du!                            No!  Better luck next time ooon!

I'm so sick of seeing those women's poochy tummys.... I get to look at my own thank you, I don't need to see others as well.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	Honestly, I have never noticed one advertisement on Facebook!  I just pay no attention at all I guess.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Really?    Weird.    I do not get the same treatment as a father. But I do get the Viagra and Cialis adds.    So since I am a father I guess they do not know all!|`|HyknHVV5aa	Maybe if you are put as "married" or "in a relationship" and 25 an older they just assume you should have children? My mom uses facebook and she is single and 60 and there is always ads saying "retire here!" or "adult dating for seniors" hahaha|`|0VUZacRTaa	I know I see it all the time too. They must spy on us! lol|`|osHRtmwNaa	I've noticed that too! Its so annoying! We have stalkers!!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I have noticed this too!  I have no idea how facebook knows that I'm a mom.  I need to ask my husband if he gets it too.  It might just be a coincidence.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I know that myspace does the SAME advertisement,and yeah when not pregnant,it's kinda annoying. Just look at it like this-the "after" picos or whatever,have to be totally edited. Noone can have NO baby belly after having a kid,it may be slight even,but it can't be there sans stretch marks and stuff unless she's paid multiple thousands of dollars for plastic surgery.
Coc593Ikaa	WTF are you talking about? You are NOT supposed to drink a lot before using a urine-based test. And it is irrelevant for blood tests.    Where did you get this idea?|`|J3JClsuQaa	I've never heard of drinking a lot for pregnancy testing, but I had to drink like 24 oz. fluid (not milk?) before I had my ultrasound, it's because the images show up better when your bladder is full...or something like that...|`|8YhITQ7laa	when you first get up is the best time to use the pregnancy test. It is the most accurate early in the morning|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	Don't drink a lot of water.. and take the test the first pee of the day. it has the highest hormones... read the direction that comes in the box of the pregnancy test .hope this helps you out and good luck!|`|QLkxGjFraa	lol they pee on the stick and it tells you if your pregnent|`|HpMXIlLVaa	No one mentioned that to me.

zmlb749jaa	The definition of a virgin is one who has not undergone sexual intercouse. If you "did" it with someone, even if incorrectly.. it would make you no longer a virgin.|`|7AYnWg3paa	sex is sex|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	How do you know? It could've broken years ago. Mine broke while playing hockey at age ten for goodness sakes. It's what has been happening with most active young girls in these days.     Bottom Line:     A penis went into your vagina so you're no longer a virgin.    (That includes your mouth and butt too! Seriously, did you know there are girls who claim to be virgins but are only so in the vaginal region? Yeah, anal and oral don't count now a days I guess.)|`|xMy0QEvFaa	No, it doesn't mean your still a virgin.|`|AA10186411	If a penis has been in you, then you are not a virgin.

bzMGqM0Naa	I am in 10th grade as of right now. Everyone is pressured to fit in in one way or another. People have a need to fit in, if you don't fit in somewhere then you are considered and outcast and nobody cares. Sometimes the people who don't find a place in the high school hierarchy have to result to doing drugs and drinking and having sex in order to be somewhere, because at least then they fit in with the other junkies and whores. I personally don't feel a pressure to do drugs and all that, because I have a place, though I am constantly pressured to maintain my place, my position to make sure no new comer comes and steals it from me. But I think another part teens do drugs or what not is the curiosity that burns in their hearts. Sure I know drugs are bad for me, and that has prevented me from trying to get my  hands on them, but I am curious to know the effects of X and all that.   In general, high school is a pressure in itself. No matter who you are there will be some kind of pressure whether it is mutual or negative.|`|nnwjRGAhaa	no... not if you have the right friends like i do!!! :)|`|c848f02ec043c58e3e0756095b5c3315aa	Yes.. but i chose to stay away and not to do bad things and be myself. Follow the RIGHT path. You'll see at the end that you did right. ;)|`|HgRYP3cJaa	yes.  easy to go with everyone else; harder to be yourself -- but so worth it in the end.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	nope you have to be around people whos priority is drugs, sex, and booze to be pressured to do it in order to fit in|`|9acXPi8gaa	Yes, people do. I'm in 8th grade (I'm 14) but I know for a fact that people are pressured to fit in. From what you wear to who you hang out with to drugs etc.|`|dRWDV6Rlaa	yess all the time  I'm moving to another town because of the people in my school  they pressure me too much  i cant take it anymore  im doing much more in school  i used to be a straight A student and now my grade lowered :[|`|EwwjA2jNaa	depends on the friends you make, but just be yourself and there's no problem. Don't change a thing about you to fit in and if you feel uncomfortable doing things then don't. High school is normally pretty sweet and i had a lot of fun and stayed myself the whole time. So it depends on the friends and what your willing or unwilling 2 do.|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	i dont think so  i choose not to do drugs  i dont drink anymore [my choice]  im not "pressured" to have sex  i dont feel pressured to fit in  i do what i want even if somebody else disagree's  i dont care what people think, nor should anyone else|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	not really bcuz i end up making those people feel stupid      i dont think theres such thing as peer pressure anyways.......if u do it...then u wanted to...if u dont want to, u dont do it, or you find a way out. Its really YOUR decision.|`|YrxJuStaaa	Nope. I'm perfectly content with my small group of friends and my good grades =)|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	I don't feel pressured to do those activities just to fit in, but I do 'bad things' as you put it but that's just because its fun.|`|7gntdi0uaa	No. People should never be pressured to fit in. People who are followers, are gonna end up following people right up into JAIL.   Be yourself. Create your own style. If people make fun of it then oh well. It's what you like and what you wanna wear. They aren't your mom. They don't tell you want to do, wear or say.|`|f1aac05e2cf2f28dae8cc17db6309e92aa	In high school?  yeah. a little. but it doesn't really get to me.  In my opinion, all the things you are told about high school, pressure and popularity and stuff, they are actually more prominent and effective in middle school.  I was really pressured to fit in back then, and now that I'm in high school, it doesn't bother me as much. (:    may i ask the reason for the question?|`|m5Qh7gYraa	I must have been a L7 in High School because i never did any of that.   Never did drink, drugs,had sex, skip class, always did my homework.|`|JusiwmMSaa	well my 9th grade year i took health and from then on drug and thing like that just make me sick at the sight i would never do that because i know the effect that it has on the human body and im sure that if a lot more people payed attention too the things that drugs do too your body befor they got addicted a lot less people would be doing it but as for sex no ive never felt pressure but i do have a child from my bf of 3 years and i was kinda not ready for it but it was all my choice i guesse its  just what knida person u are,if ur easily manipulated or not but im very happy with my lifeand looking foward too making it much better and drugs and anyones opions aout my dcisions will never effect me|`|B7zL81whaa	Why do you think Hollister, AE and Abercrombie make so much money?|`|NW39CoLKaa	HELL NO.    BE INDIVIDUAL, *****.|`|eTPpYNPYaa	umm no, you do that stuff cuz you want to not cuz of pressure u must be some kind of outkast with no friends|`|S6WRVfcOaa	yeah, but a i little ky loosened that thang up|`|Zki0DuLWaa	Are you kidding me. YES!|`|JmNs0Hgbaa	haha, first of all, i love your dp & name.    second, i'm kinda respected in my class and in my class if you wanna fit in/be respected, you have to get good grades, and be freakin' sporty and join loads of clubs.    NB: i go to a private school.|`|WV12FdQ9aa	theres some of that but not much.... i just be myself and not let anyone tell me to do anything different...i am my own person and i am who i am.. if people dont like it then they can just kiss my *** =]|`|h3rN7snkaa	I'm aware of the pressure, but it doesn't get to me. I think its such a state of mind kids get themselves into, and then use it as an excuse. So I guess over all I don't.|`|H90uflbFaa	not really. like people have offered me drugs and stuff buti turned them down.|`|M5Sw5SWfaa	I've avoided drugs and alcohol cause I feel like it'll ruin my reputation. I don't skip class, occasionally, I don't do my homework cause laziness gets in the way or I forget. Other than that, I'm a good girl~    :D|`|D8gFfDwuaa	I'm not in High School|`|BhFY6gdxaa	of course. its only nature. its whether you give into it or not. you can also feel pressured to do well in school...not only bad.|`|AA10313901	Not really ... mostly because I could not afford to fit in, so I figured, "screw it."    My family has lots of alcoholism, substance abuse, un-wed pregnancies, dropouts, etc.    I put a lot of pressure on myself to NOT behave like that because I wanted to have something/be something.    BTW, the biggest snobs from my high school ended up back in our little hometown, lots of kids, no careers, etc....... So I won!!!|`|0uhRgfcsaa	i never did, screw what other people want outta you. be yourself and let it be known and nobody will try to pressure you into dumb things.|`|R0YkIVlpaa	well i dont feel pressured because i'm always being me even though i do drink but no drugs or sex....but its things most teenagers do so they can be all cool but once they get in trouble those who you thaught where your friends wont even come looking if your ok|`|pHIUUnOiaa	OF COURSE everybody does i have actually started to feel a little pressured to have sex and skip but then i think that i have been brought up with a wonderful family that loves me to death i have good morals and why would i even think of doing that because high school i just being about yourself not being a wanna be trust me people will just like you if you are being yourself not a wannabe|`|V1hxvQukaa	nope.    i used to care about how people perceived the way i looked, but then i changed to a "i don't give a **** what they think about me" attitude. i'm much happier these days =]|`|8c6862a271d7f95609a6595669ffda82aa	yup|`|k42OcjGLaa	At one point, everyone has.|`|L4eEuaanaa	Me?  No, not really.  If I do, I try to talk myself out of it.|`|OwAE70I5aa	dfddf|`|xKcphGWIaa	nope i dont !|`|XkJfs2l9aa	absolutely.  high school changes you.|`|X5afTqKiaa	SEX!!!!!!! You are nasty!!!!!|`|AkbYFpMiaa	Yea but best thing to do is keep a straight mind and keep to your morals Im drug alcohol and crime free :)|`|iEVwHmchaa	y, do you? hahahahahahaha. u suk|`|wDOjkaYUaa	Absolutely, who wants to be the odd one out?|`|1cL06jyTaa	no i dont really give a fu ck|`|8Q1MGgBRaa	i dont do drugs, skip class, not do homework or anything like that and i  am pretty popular so nope not at all|`|HhPgZDDzaa	Personally, I didn't, but I know that a lot of kids do. They think that if they don't do what the "cool" kids are doing, then they will be considered an outcast. Unfortunately, for the most part, it is true. If you know that it is wrong, and you don't want to do it, then don't. Be yourself. Just remember that in high school, your grades are what carries over, not your social status...|`|AA12358887	It's called peer pressure.  Almost everyone gets it|`|M6bPkZl9aa	of course, who wouldn't...but it's your choice whether to really be changed by that or not.|`|nI6dyZCNaa	NO!    ive always been like that!    im the one that pressures people!    ahahahha!    :]|`|f278d0dc8d59bec81023a69a3faa4cfdaa	not at all..  well i skipped class but that was my idea and i had a good reason(:|`|Yn3OOdP3aa	nope i could care less of what someone thinks of me.  be yourself!|`|nOmuccPnaa	Everyone does! Everyone feels pressure to fit in with someone or some group at some point in time. Its life. Those years can be really fun but also really tough. Use good judgment and remember life goes on after high school!|`|94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	Everyone does. It's a perfectly normal reaction.     Resisting peer pressure is how you build character.     If you really *do* want to do these things...well, that's not really peer pressure. That's just you.|`|AA11559211	i felt pressured to show up    but then i went to a catholic school   there is no fitting in   there is just hiding from the nun|`|cfn8mYF6aa	i feel pressured to all of those except for sex. i dont even have a bf. haha    im pressured but i dont do any of them. sometimes i want too just to get on my parents nerves.|`|6pEDLnrzaa	not at all, i'm not going to be like the rejects. at the reject(alteritive) hight school|`|ylZTCrSYaa	i'm sure other kids feel pressured and i know many who have given in to the pressure. i suppose i'm different because when people try to pressure me to have a drink or skip class or have sex, it's so easy for me to just say "no." even if they bug me and pressure me more, my descision in my mind is firm and it never changes. maybe it's because i see so many people at my high school smoking and drinking and doing drugs and getting pregnant and dropping out and i just really don't want to be like them.|`|Y8AxM7c1aa	I found my first year or so it felt like that but then after awhile when smoking pot or having sex isn't a HUGE deal, you feel that it's okay if you don't want to do those things and just things your comfortable with.    You are your own person. Don't let anyone force you into someone you don't want to do because believe me you WILL regret it...most of the time anyways.|`|iGZWeWwBaa	I'm in middle school, but i have tons of friends in high school. No matter what, people will always pressure you to try to make you feel fit in. Just think about it & how it could affect you in the future. Like doing drugs is not good. You should tell them NO because you know there are better things in life than just getting high. Or Sex, you don't wanna be a teenage mom or dad do you? That would change your life so much I bet.     I hope i helped =)|`|gbX2aTu0aa	Yes, even the people who deny it. Everything changes, some people just don't notice...|`|BIvEVNDaaa	Yes i do.    I feel pressured to do weed because my best friend has recently started. But i know i won't because i don't believe doing drugs is for me. That's all i really feel pressured about doing. But i just tell myself stick to what you believe.    I do though not feel pressured to skip classes, or not do my homework. I always go to class and do my homework because i want to get a good job and succeed in life.|`|XwrjRj52aa	nope.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	It really depends on who your friends are and how much you care what people think of you. I would say that by the end of high school, over 75% of people have had sex, over 50% have drank alcohol, and over 25% have done drugs of some kind. almost 100% will have skipped class at least once.    high school is about growing up and trying new things. don't try them if you don't want to, but also don't stress out about "doing the right thing" all the time either. making mistakes is part of growing up too.    that said, I know people who stuck to their resolve and made it all the way through high school AND college without drinking, doing drugs, or having sex. it IS possible, and people DO manage to stay clean. don't feel like you're the only virgin in the world and lose it just to "fit in." you're not the only virgin.     again, it really depends on who your friends are. sometimes, if you don't want to drink and all your friends do, you can either (1) find new friends, or (2) offer to be their safe ride home and stay sober.    good luck!|`|LDuzqDZKaa	I'm in the 9th grade and that's one thing I don't do I have a few friends and don't want a lot neither! But as I always say "I NEVER TRY TO FIT IN.. I WAS BORN TO STAND OUT"|`|znngp3E0aa	I don't feel pressured to do those things.

880810d4326c921557a558c16c9d1c6daa	Pregnancy tests are 99% accurate. You can still get a light bleeding while you are pregnant, and many women get spotting. Did this bleeding begin on the exact day? Usually pregnancy spotting begins randomly. You said it was heavy, which is probably a period. Your period is the shedding of your endometrium, this is the lining in which the blasocyst (the developing embryo) implants into. If that lining is shed, the baby cannot survive.     If you got pregnant from the 21, it may be still too early so the hCG levels may not be high enough, but that is unlikely. hCG spikes very high once it signals the period to stop, and continues to remain at high levels for 10weeks after conception. Most likely, you are not pregnant. Take another test in a few days, if it continues to be negative I would say you are okay.     You can only get pregnant 2 days of the month, when ovulation occurs. Ovulation is usually the 14th day (but not always) of your cycle. A new cycle begins when your period begins. If you are really concerned, go to the doctor, they can do a simple blood test (which is extremely accurate) to let you know. If I were you, I wouldn't be concerned. But, in the future, make sure you are using some form of birth control to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. Hope this helps!|`|TxV2DRpNaa	you can be pregnant. In fact, if your period is always regular, Your chances of being pregnant are prob far greater. You will need to wait a couple weeks and take another pregnancy test. not to mention tests are not 100% acurate! Wear protection next time.|`|pn88K8UXaa	well 1) pregnancy tests take a while... check back in a month or so.  2) your period is just irregular.|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	you only get spotting if your prego|`|R65Owmebaa	Did you take the test a week before your next period on the 14th and 21st ? if not the test might not be accurate.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	implantation  bleed.|`|aztQDdMXaa	1. You have to wait 2-3 weeks in order for the test to be accurate.  2. Lemon and lime, can cut off your period routine.  3. Stressing can also cut off your regular schedule.(worrying too much can also affect your schedule.)  4. You might just be irregular, it is normal for you not to have your period, for 35 days.   Hope I helped!  =>_  Don't worry!|`|jLb0mx9laa	You probably just need more iron in your system, that can mess them up. That can also happen from stress and eating very unhealthy.|`|M7IKzYMiaa	your not pregnant.|`|WZgcnVanaa	you could be.  get another pregnancy test...or 2.  a test can be wrong, if it says it's negative, you could still be pregnant.  but if it comes out positive, you're definitely pregnant.  if you're still not sure, go to the doctor.|`|NEIoCMEAaa	Yes. You could be, make sure and check with your doctor about that.|`|zKwI03Ovaa	Most pregnancy tests don't register till after your first missed period or six weeks after unprotected sex. The spotting can just be the egg implanting it's self in the uterus. So pretty much chances are you are knocked up. You did have sex with another human right?
R9AAhsIjaa	My baby laughed out loud for the first time at around 3 months. She's almost a year and finds everything hysterical! You can just look at her and she cracks up!|`|XAoRiPfXaa	Mine was 3 months.
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	oh yeah.... I have a gamer hubby... he likes online games and SIM sports... I've always hated the stupid games..but now I do even more...he's much better now that Jacob is here but I still hate the stupid games... I wish he'd do something more worthwhile like READ|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	lol yes . lucky mine carries things but that is about it . when my back hurts ( i am preggo 29 weeks ) and have the toddler climbing up my leg and he is siting on his a$$ watch god knows what .Men are big babies ! Or when the babies are crying at night and he never takes his turn and i say something and he says 'what can i do' <br>  slap<br>  or when i take my girl shopping with me so he can be alone ( god what is alone) for a couple hrs and some back and the house is a wreak . SLAP. How in the hell in 2 hrs can one grown up make such a damned mess so fast   Bungholes lol|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Replace that with my husband and the computer and I feel your pain. He drives me crazy sometimes, but I'm sure that I drive him crazy sometimes too! We all have those moments. So yes I do feel like that as well.|`|aDQgLEbuaa	I don't have a husband or boyfriend, but I definitely get this way with other loved ones sometimes.  It's natural, as long as you don't act on it :]|`|HK30PzNraa	LOL,you made me laugh!! Next time come in and say if you want dinner can you bring in the groceries?I think everyone feels like this at some point,you are not alone!GOD-bless|`|fHjSonssaa	Ha!!  I just read this to my partner - he's playing XBox 360 RIGHT NOW.<br>  <br>  He just got so pissed- no sense of humor because he knows it sounds JUST LIKE HIM!!!!|`|3MVv1uOaaa	Well, I don't live with my boyfriend but my dad does that all the time! I could easily punch him. hahahah|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i feel that everyday ...|`|b6EyFLgUaa	OMG yes but i never do i just give him the look and he knows and normally says hes sorry for what ever he did.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	my husband gets his *** outside & carries them in or then i punch him.. he seems to act pretty childish to me|`|hKJIDdVqaa	lol, yes. Actually I do. when he leaves he dirty laundry strewed across the house. Or when he conveniently has something to do when I am helping the children with homework or baths. Or better yet when he leaves his dirty laundry in the CLEAN laundry.  But alas I have adapted.....your not alone..lol|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Oh yes...I was up all night with a really sick 4 year old and the next day looked after her and the baby, clleaned up cooked dinner and he got home and said " Why are you not recycling the milk cartons?" My Mum was there and I threw a slice of fruitcake at his head. Lol. I lost it.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	Most of the time lol. Now I just take the cold things out and put them away and when he asks if I need a hand after the fact I say yep I left all the other things for you to bring in.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I won't say punching him in the face, more like slapping him with a frying pan. We all have those moments when the spouse ticks us off.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Aha..yes|`|256cVXsmaa	Lmao omg every day of my life!!!!
44OH7Si6aa	Brown eyes, darker skin. Brown eyes are dominant and since daddy is tongan his brown eyed genes will overrule your blue eyed genes. Same with the pigmentation of the skin, he probably won't be as dark as your boyfriend but he will have the darker coloring|`|xGedX2rIaa	probalily brown, think its a 1/3 chance of blue|`|JJRtLS1Laa	eye color is very hard because it is controlled by more then one allele. or it could be co-dominant or incomplete dominant, meaning it could be a mix inbetween the two colors. however brown eyes are usually dominant, and it is very likely he will have brown eyes.   also many babys true eye color dont show until they are older. mine were dark brown until i was 13 and now they're a light orangey brown with oliver green on the outer edges. and both my parents have dark brown eyes !    so basically its going to be a surprise worth waiting for ! :)
t7cuerySaa	get rid of the Ys.especially the the girls names coz sounds like striper name to me.why can't you use normal name Isabelle Mikaela or Katherine instead of putting so many weird-hard-to-spelled names  Austyn-Austin Power  Karsyn-Carcinogen  Kamiryn-Cameroon|`|TYl7kmPeaa	love vincent julius alexander!!!  dont really like the girls names with all the "y"s  i think if it was Juliette Austyn Kaydynce it would sound better|`|EvgSMTjnaa	Zackary Jason Quade  Austyn Isabella Juliet|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Well its definitely a mouthful|`|8CPH9l0vaa	My lands what on Earth is going on with your strange spellings?? Why not just spell it like it's supposed to be spelled? Austyn for a girl is not really a good name in my opinion, nor is Karsyn. I understand everybody's need and want for individuality, but there comes a point when it just gets ridiculous... Austin, Caidence, Cameron, and Carson is just fine for spelling those names.|`|AA10709259	No offense, but those names are quite a mouthful and not very pretty. The spelling is so unusual that your child will have a hard time explaining it to people. What's wrong with regular names such as Emma, Julia, Emilia, Patricia, Sam, Jonathan, John, Patrick?|`|NzEcIEjUaa	I loveeee Vincent Julius Alexander Carpenter, and for a girl, definitely Kamiryn.    You certainly like Y's, dont you?    Congratulations!  Diana|`|IISgmLuPaa	Karson Renee Austen Carpendor  Vincent Julien Alexander Carpendor
osHRtmwNaa	A good wipe from front to back with sensitive wipes immediately after she poos is fine. Otherwise, she would get a rash. I'm guessing its your first baby? I was OCD with my first as well. You will get over it. Just don't feel any less when you start not to have time to rinse anymore. No mother is superwoman. Don't ever try to be or you will tear yourself apart.|`|6lBWoKrgaa	you don't need to rinse her every time she poos, but you need to wipe her with baby wipes though. You don't need to bath your baby daily because it can damage the development of her skin.|`|vhraHxtNaa	just use the baby wipes cuz they have moisturizers and constantly washing a baby will dry out their skin...|`|4g2D2y14aa	Then what are baby wipes for?|`|AA12104815	If it a big mess down there then why not, i found it easier with my first son. Sometimes it seemed like it exploded on the way out . waste too many wipes trying to clean that up. i would sit him on the sink rim like he was on the toilet and just wash his bottom, pat dry and fresh as new...phew...lol|`|Lnpqs5lHaa	I dont think its crazy to wash their butts after they poop in the sink.    But to give them a bath everytime, seems too much.    I use to always rinse my babys butt in the sink when she pooped. Unless i feel lazy then i would wipe.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I have never rinsed my daughter. I use baby wipes with every diaper change and she takes a bath every night.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	My brother-in-law did this to my niece (his daughter) until she was 6!!!!  I think it is INSANE and that you can just use the wipes.    Yes, you need to stop.  You are going to be psycho Frank, doing this and embarrassing your 4, 5 and 6 year old in front of company.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It probably can't hurt, but wow, that's a lot of baths.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Ummm, nope. If I clean my kids diaper and for some reason they smell afterwards, I'll bathe them, but normally, nope.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	LOL, ummm...that's why there are baby wipes...they work just fine...especially at 5 months!!  I was not putting my baby under the faucet every time he poo'd..but that's up to u...|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Only if it's a runny poop diaper that has covered 50% of her body...lol...otherwise I just use baby wipes.  She gets a bath every night, so I know she'll be really clean before going to bed.|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	I think its a bit over board. I bet once that girl is older and heavier you wont be putting her under the faucet. If you wipe from front to back you wouldnt have to worry about this.|`|4iXL4C6paa	I bathe him everyday but when he poos I just use wipes.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I have a boy. I use a baby wipe. That's what they are for. You need to think more about the germs you are putting in your sink...the sink where you do your dishes (kitchen) or brush your teeth (bathroom). That is disgusting. Just water isn't going to clean her any ways. I would just use baby wipes or a washcloth. That is too much work.|`|8Ob9dD2yaa	well i just wipe and everyone i know wipes but your her mother and it is whatever u think is best for her|`|aMpMFLo3aa	I just use baby wipe for my daughter and she fine ;)|`|dwdLkvgPaa	No not every time she poos...this is what baby wipes are for...do you rinse every time you go?? I don't think that it is necessary|`|XOtOMncwaa	I can't say that I do that, I just use wipes. And he gets a bath every night. Yeah it might be a little OCD, but if you have the time then go for it... just watch out and make sure your not drying your baby's skin out!|`|rymbwVKXaa	that is a little ocd all they need is to be cleaned with a wipe or cloth. you don't even need to bathe them everyday.
AA10152665	Of course you do. You are female and it is programmed into women to have babies. Do you really think the human race could carry on if it wasn't? You are absolutely, perfectly normal for wanting a baby and here's why.    Hormones...    Yes hormones. Because you are 13 I bet you hear about hormones all the time. But they do more than make you boy crazy. Hormones are like little messages that run around and tell your body to do things. They are sort of like the nervous system, except instead of electrical impulses, they are chemical releases. At 13 your body has just realized it can make all these cool messages so it's going a little overboard practicing. It's like your body just noticed your uterus is working and your boobs are getting big so it wants to try them out. You are physically becoming a woman so your hormones are also creating womanly emotions. The result? Right along with wanting a boyfriend you also want to take care of something, something warm and soft, little and sweet, something that depends on you, something that gives you a purpose, a baby.     It's not a phase and I'm glad for it. Some ladies are just naturally born mothers and the world needs more of them. I do bet that as your hormones level out some you won't feel so desperate.     Right now I've got a five month old in my lap. I'm 19 and in my third year of college. So here comes the personal advice. Finish school. Finish school. Finish school. I don't care if you go to college but finish high school. Second, find a way that you don't have to work full time. I'm puritanical and believe that means you should be married but that is an other question for an other day.     Here's the reason. You want that baby so much and that baby wants you. You don't want to have to leave it. You can't imagine how hard it is to leave your little one, even for a short time, much less eight hours a day. Also that would make breastfeeding so hard. (Which in my opinion is one of the best parts.) Then you have to come home and do homework while the most beautiful little thing in the world is just looking at you, feeling lonely. And spending 3 years working is not going to cut it. At some point you are going to have to get a job and it is going to be hard.     Next piece of advice. Having a baby is not like a babysitting job. They are not like holding one for a while. They are not like seeing that little smile and waving goodbye. They are every day, every night, every moment, every second of your life, your time, your mind, and your body. Having a baby makes you eat sleep and breathe someone else. I love my son with all my heart but it is so hard. I am having a little bit of a hard time right now because I feel like myself has gone away and all that is left is his mama. You know babies are hard but you can never understand the complete takeover until you live it. They are wonderful beyond belief. I wouldn't trade one day with my son for anything. This is not criticism. This is truth, just keep it in mind. Being a mama is not a babysitting job.     You are smart, you are also young. I know you hate hearing that but you also know it yourself. Please stay smart.    As a last note, being sort of young won't hurt a baby. Being super young won't but so long as your period is established, no worries. Pregnancy might be harder on your body though. Technically you still need at least 9 hours of sleep a night and you body is still growing. Making a baby could take a lot out of you.    EDIT:: I'm sorry you're getting so many nasty comments. you're not stupid and you're not going out to get pregnant tonight.   I do want to add this. The only way I am getting to stay home with my baby is because my wonderful husband dropped out of school to work full time and support us. Money is tight but careful planning makes it work. I can honestly say I would hate my life if I had to work. I think it would make me physically ill to leave my son that long every day. I might even start resenting him for making me feel so bad.   Life takes money. There is no point in having a baby if you can't be around enough to enjoy it.   Just a suggestion, try adding up all your expenses for a month to see how much you would need to make. Be careful and don't forget anything and I think you will be shocked.|`|4NhPaIkTaa	It is normal to want a kid (even at 13) but you need to control that until you are at least 18-19 preferably early 20's (ive been wanting a kid for years and am 23 and pregnant with my first)  I dont think you will make enough money as a teenager especially under 16 to care for a baby. I make 15$/hour and for me to go to work after my baby is born, childcare is going be half of my check ( i take home about 2000$/month and itll cost me over $800/month just for childcare.    You are going to need to finish school, and work which is going to be really difficult and so youll probably end up dropping out of school so you can work full time, your still not going to make alot of money.  You'll probably be able to get by (most teen mothers do) but you wont really be happy.  Youll wish you would have waited a little longer so you could get a better job and provide a better life for your child.    You will also miss out on alot of your childhood and will have problems with finding a decent BF cuz guys your age dont want kids yet, and dont want to be with a mom that has a kid.    If you must have a kid early in life please wait until you at least finish high school and have a decent job with advancement opportunities. That way you dont bring a child into a life where they are going to be poor. And hopefully you find a guy that will help you with raising the child (hopefully you both agreed to having the baby cuz if you tricked him into it thats f^cked up)    As a teenage mother you are at higher risk for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillborn babies, babies dying of SIDS, twins(you DONT want twins this early) and babies with birth defects    Risks to mother -     Risks of having a baby as a teenager    Pregnancy and birth can put a tremendous strain on a teenager's body. If bone structure is not fully developed, she takes the risk of injuring her spine and pelvic bones, altering her life forever.  Risks to baby  Premature babies - ome of these babies do die. The ones that make it tend to have problems later in life, mental and physical problems are included. A low birth weight baby is one that is born with a weight of less than 5 1/2 pounds. These babies have a greater risk of being born with major birth defects.     Low birthweight - Low birthweight is associated with several infant and childhood disorders and a higher rate of infant mortality. Low-birthweight babies are more likely to have organs that are not fully developed, which can result in complications, such as bleeding in the brain, respiratory distress syndrome, and intestinal problems.    Children born to teenage mothers are less likely to receive proper nutrition, health care, and cognitive and social stimulation. As a result, they are at risk for lower academic achievement.   Children born to teenage mothers are at increased risk for abuse and neglect.   Boys born to teenage mothers are 13% more likely to be incarcerated later in life.   Girls born to teenage mothers are 22% more likely to become teenage mothers themselves.     Other Consequences of Teenage Pregnancy     Teenage births are associated with lower annual income for the mother. Eighty percent of teen mothers must rely on welfare at some point.   Teenage mothers are more likely to drop out of school. Only about one-third of teen mothers obtain a high school diploma.   Teenage pregnancies are associated with increased rates of alcohol and substance abuse, lower educational level, and reduced earning potential in teen fathers.   In the United States, the annual cost of teen pregnancies from lost tax revenues, public assistance, child health care, foster care, and involvement with the criminal justice system is estimated to be about $7 billion.|`|AA11762804	I know you dont want to hear that it is a phase but it is, almost every girl goes though it, but i am 17 and im pregnant, and excited but scared. you will need to finish school, or you will go no place, a baby well hmmm need about $2,000 to start and be independent have your own place, car ,insurance, food, ectt, your looking at about a total cost of 2500a month and that is about 30,000 a year to get by in to days economy and things will not get any cheaper they will just get more and more expensive. Premature birth is a high risk as well as birth defects and death to the baby and the mother. so if you do decide to get pregnant go online and make a living will. I hope everything goes ok, its a lot of work, dont rely on state assistance dont ruin someone Else's life, make sure you are finacilay, and emotionally stable before you even think about it. I am i have my own place and a job im done school, ect...... once your pregnant what you want dose not matter anymore  baby eats before u eat  baby gets new clothes before u get new clothes  its never gonna be about u anymore  u beome last on the priority list|`|jIQKc1dAaa	Its really not normal to want a kid as a 13 year old....but to each their own. I'd hold off on the baby dreams for awhile. Do society a favor and wait til after high school. even if you get knocked up the day after you graduate it'll make everything easier. And having a baby at 13 would distroy your body. Its so not good for you.|`|0DiqkBzUaa	i am 13 too. But in no way am i ready for a baby. If you are, then that's fine. But maybe you could try for a job at a child care or baby-sit one of your parents friends baby's. Or you could babysit your auntie or uncle's babies or possibly their friends babies. Then you will see how hard it really is. I help look after my sister and she is 1 and she is hard work, do u really want that as well as the stress of the pregnancy and labour? And as  soon as the baby is born, you have to provide it with clothes, shelter and food. 3 years of work is not going to cover a baby's whole childhood, up until your child leaves home, which could be as late as early 20's. You will be working all your life. If you want a baby in a couple of years go for it! But you will be the one stuck at home with your child while others are having a good time. If you have a baby, you will barely see it. As you will be working for your next meal. I have seen others go through this and i wouldnt suggest it. But it's your life i can't, or anyone else, can tell you what to do. Your in control of your own life. So don't mess it up. You have only got one.|`|hi2QRyGUaa	I'm not going to criticize, but I'll tell you what my sister went through...    She had a baby at 19, the year after she graduated high school. She had to drop out of college, move back to our dull hometown, and find a job where she could make a decent living without any higher education (she graduated at the top of her class in high school, and even she couldn't keep up with the course-load once the baby came along). Luckily for her, she found an "okay" job where she currently makes $15/hour. Also, the baby's father stuck around and has a salaried job where he makes okay money. All that aside, they still ask my parents for a lot of help (financially and otherwise) and are just barely scraping by. She's miserable and the father isn't much better off.    I think that you should get out and see the world first before you make that kind of commitment. If you really enjoy being around babies, volunteer at a nursery or offer to baby-sit for people that have them.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	1.  Can you afford your own house, to pay for groceries, to pay for electricity and insurance?  2.  Can you drive, afford to buy a car and pay for petrol?  3.

Can you emotionally deal with a baby that is 100% reliable on you, that will scream and cry every half an hour, will make you get up every half and hour to feed him or her?  6.  Can you handle a child with colic, constipation and restlessness?    No I dont think you can.

Are you ready for that?|`|AA11371251	It is normal for girls to go through a phase where they really want a baby and may even believe that they are ready to have one. But a mature person will realize that sometimes even the things we want the most need to be pushed back to a time when we are really ready. It would not be fair for you to bring a child in to this world right now when you cannot afford a house or food or hospital visits not to mention it wouldn't have a loving family (mom and dad) to help raise it. It's easy to say right now that you would work your butt off to raise it and such but if you actually had to it would be different. Plus wouldn't it be great to wait until your more prepared and be able to be a stay at home mom and be there for your kids first word, crawl, step and so on? You seem like a smart girl and it is normal to feel how you are feeling but hold out until you are financially, mentally, physically. emotionally ready it will be SO much better and well worth the wait. And your future husband will be loving that he was able to be there for all those things as well.|`|kzbEWqgLaa	I think the only reason you want a baby is because they are cute and fun... Yes, that's true, but no matter how hard you work, you'll still never have enough money.. You see the little cute shoes, and cute bottles, and adorable strollers, and you still won't have enough money. Babies need pampers you know? and they get bigger everyday constantly.. What kind of job can you get at 13? Who's going to watch the baby while your at school? ARE YOU going to continue school? You need some sort of education to get a decent job to provide for the baby. you do realize that if you have a baby, things will never be the same. You can't do any of the usual teen stuff, like dating, or movies, or parties because you'll be stuck at home taking care of a baby.. You can't just get rid of it when you want either... So if that's what you want to do then go right ahead, but you'll see how much you regret it soon enough|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I think its normal to want to be a mother but your way to young right now. You dont have anything to offer a baby at this point in your life. Only 5years ago you were 8years old. Your way to young and if you got pregnant your parents would be the one taking care of your baby. Your baby would be much more proud of you as his/her mother if you had a highschool diploma, went off to college (and enjoyed your youth) fell in love, got married and both you and your partner were finacially stable and ready to provide for a family. You will make a much better mother if you just wait.|`|8CPH9l0vaa	You are ridiculous! Where are your parents?? This is NOT okay. You are NOT sane or normal. You are a KID! Go do KID LIKE things! Good grief... what is going on in the world today??!|`|J3JClsuQaa	I think you are normal, most young girls think up baby names and stuf like that...it's in our DNA as females  : )  however, (u knew it was coming) as you mentioned you are way too young, and you might not believe it now, but you and your FUTURE baby will be much happier if you wait, you have to go to college, to get a good job to be able to afford the things you want for your child, to afford a college education for your child... you say you realize this, but I don't think you do... I cried when I found out I was pregnant with my second child.  I have an OK job, but it's not great and I worry all the time that I won't be able to support my 6 yr old daughter and a newborn, even with my fiancee's help.  It's hard out here in the working world.  The cost of childcare is crrrazy.  I also have family members who help me...watch my daughter sometimes, but won't be able to help with the newborn...Sorry I wrote so much, but I'm trying to sway ya, make ya think... Please wait, Haley|`|f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	Like everyone else, I suggest you hold off on having a baby till you're stable and married.  But like most teens you probably need to get burned by the fire to realize it's hot.    The least you CAN do is whoever you sleep with, be honest upfront and tell them that you want and are actively trying to get pregnant.  Never deceive a guy or try to trick him into getting you pregnant, cause chances are he will trick you back and do a disappearing act so as it comes.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	There's nothing wrong with your love of babies, but fortunately you are smart enough to realize the implications of having one as a teenager. Just save that love for when you are old enough to properly care for and have a life for that child, with a husband that you love. Think about the baby, you want your child to have the best, and being a teen is the worst situation. You can save money from now until you are 20 and still not be prepared for the upbringing of a child. You need to have an excellent paying job, health insurance, a home, etc. As a teen, once you have a baby your life is over. Period. No socializing. It is an insane hardship that you would regret. This is not criticism but reality. My aunt runs a school/dorm for pregnant teens. I have seen their struggles for over 10 years now. Please believe me and wait. If you want to see what I'm talking about, go to St. Gerard Campus website.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	NO.  Why?  Your reasoning is not sound.  I will admit you sound more mature than some, but still it is not the thing to do.  Your spelling is almost excellent. Well, criticism.  I had my son at 15. One month from my 16th birthday and he was not planned. Not at all.   I had no job, no plans for one.   I barely had a life. I was very close to running away.   There is so much to do out there. And the economy sucks right now.   You are planning to save what? Babysitting money??  I had some of that ...AFTER I had my baby. I would watch about 4 other kids, my son, and my little sister. I got paid peanuts. It went for female products, and possibly a shirt for my son. This was a few years back.   Now? Now you need a full time job. Full time.   And an education to fall back on.   Risks?  Anything could happen, who knows?  You could have problems with the childbirth, not the baby.   Please rethink your decision.   Have you told your mom that she will be watching your child for you if you go to school still?|`|l1ULKxclaa	Risks of having a baby as a teenager (for the baby, ex: deformed etc.) ?

Don't have a baby. You're to young.|`|nYnlYAE1aa	You really need to focus on more important things. Having a baby while you are still in school shouldn't be a priority.

Some girls just can't help the way they feel about this and I admire you for waiting. All I can say is spend as much time baby sitting as you can and you will see it isn't perfect... there isnt giving a baby away when your tired and its crying, needing to be fed and changed. You sound like a sensible girl. Do your best to wait and you won't regret it|`|f0eb0ad17f4200a9735cb695ba251787aa	You are normal for wanting a baby and i guess it's good you at least want to possibly wait until 18. However, you do realize that it will cost more to have a baby than what 3 years at a mall or fast food joint will pay right? The most you can earn is 10k a year and thats if you're lucky.      How do you see your child's future? will you pay for their college?  How? fast food money isn't enough .  you will barely be able to scrape by.     So..the main problem, isn't your bodies ability..it is able!     THe only problem is your future and your baby's future.  If you want to raise it correctly and have some money, wait until you are having a job and get a 2-4 year college degree, folllowed by a good job where you can support that baby!|`|MzHwklzKaa	Wanting a baby can be normal.    Obsessing over a baby is not.  You are missing something in your life that you think a baby can give you.  Usually, young mothers crave unconditional love they don't get from their families.    I really recommend therapy.  There's more to life than having a baby.  You are missing out on lots of your life by obsessing like this.    A lot of what you say reminds me of a child asking their mother for a puppy.  They make the same promises, think they know everything, promise to save up all their money, and 3 weeks after they get the dog, they don't want anything to do with it.    I'm not criticising.  I'm not judging.  I'm not even telling you not to have a baby.    I'm saying there's more to your life AT THIS VERY MOMENT than having a baby.  In my opinion, you need to find out about life and the world before you give birth.    Your uterus isn't going anywhere.  There's plenty of time for babies.    EDIT TO ADD:  Remember: It won't ALWAYS be a baby.  In just a short time, you're going to deal with "the terrible twos".  You'll have a teenager someday.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Get a job    or a hobby|`|mtDWu8sXaa	Can you just do a lot of babysitting for now and save up for later?  Or maybe volunteer as a candystriper at the hospital and help out in the baby area.  Might help out.  You have all the time in the world sweetheart.  Find someone to share this with you in the future, don't do it alone.  I understand you want a baby, and you might be more mature then others are your age, but please, do wait.  You still have dances and dates to go on, and prom even, graduation...take care of your career first, so you DON'T have to work you *** off as much in the future...and then you can provide everything you want and desire for your baby instead of struggling.....make it fun and enjoy your baby first, don't make it something that will take all the energy out of you.  God Bless, please wait for your baby's sake and it's future.....talk to other teen mothers, talk to your parents....there is counselors and there is Planned Parenthood that can help you.  Good luck sweetie.  =)|`|Coc593Ikaa	I wonder if you are trying to replace something else in your life. A sense of real family and love perhaps? How is your home life? I don't know you personally, but much of the time when a young girl wants a baby it is to fill a void. I implore you to soul search and really think about this. Babies are wonderful, but your intense urge is not normal for your age. Try to figure out what else is missing. Once you identify that, perhaps you can find a more aga-appropreate, healthy way to fill the gap.    As for health risks, you are at slightly higher risk of multiples, but that is about it. Your risk for chromosomal abnormalities is very low.|`|oYzXuu4haa	I think it is okay that you want a baby. And you seem to already know that you are to young right now to have one. Before you have one, you need to be financially stable.  They're are all kinds of risks of having a baby. Not just with teens but with anyone that gets pregnant. And most risks you might not know until you actually get pregnant. and the risks could be to your baby to so You can look up the risks of teen pregnancy. That would probably help you out alot. But you should seriously wait until you are older.|`|t8HPCzrOaa	while hun i dont think your crazy for wanting a baby i wanted a baby since i was 13 also but i couldnt cause my parents are strict on me am 18 and still want a baby i beg my boyfriend almost everyday but he is not readying and doesnt want to have a baby right now i cried about it everynite to him and i beg i mean beg for a baby i would be happy if i had one i feel incomplete without a lil one in my life and am stilling trying to see if my bf can give me one he says he well but yet he doesnt want to i can tell but hun wait until your at least 17 or 18 cause ur only 13 and its going to be tought and hard having a baby is not easy also knowing what ppplz family and ur friends well have to say about you and stuff its going to be to much for you hun hang in there for just a couple more years am trying my best right now baby are alot of hard work and needs alot of attention going to sckol and working well be hard for u cuz u wont have anytime for it also if your parents put u out hun who dont help u raise it wait until 17 or 18 then hun if u need to talk to me about it my email is sherbear2929@yahoo.com ok hun i know how u feel am going throu it rite now hun|`|627pWyVkaa	Its quite simple. No your not normal to want a baby right now. Yes the baby has A very high chance of deformity, you have higher chance of complications, and dying during birth as your body isn't prepared or ready to have one yet. Your going to get criticism for posting this period. And you cant even spell criticism!  Your not old enough to have a baby! You would have to your parents permission probably for half of all your doctors orders, to get prescriptions filled anything! How can you have a baby when you are still one yourself! You cant work. How can you afford one, How can you take your baby too doctor appointments and go to prenatal classes, and appointments yourself? That is very selfish if your parents wanted another child they would have one themselves! You cant work when you have a newborn child. most day cares will not take newborns!!!!!! Babies, in diapers and everything else cost thousands of dollars, where would you get this money from? I do no even think the government would HElp you out because your, Your parents responsibility not theirs! Wait until your at least 18 and have education and a job behind you! Its great you want kids, But you are too young. babysit for others that have young newborns and see how hard it is and Not just for a day, Or two. Over night, for at least a weekend ask your parents, and do it all yourself and see HOW much you want a baby then!|`|YrK7S8xtaa	I wanted a baby as a teenager too. I got pregnant the first time when i was 15, i had a few miscarriages because i was young and clearly my young body was not ready to carry a pregnancy.    Eventually i had a baby at 17, i dont totally regret it or anything and i do work, but i wish i had of finished school, went to university and then had a baby. I earn good money but im not passionate about my job and wish i did go to university and have my life sorted before i had my first daughter. However i am starting to follow my dream of being a nurse in April this year and i can still achieve what i wanted to its just that i will be 26 before im qualified.    Just want to add that i do understand how you feel but i think you should think long and hard about it and ask yourself why you want this.    I have known a lot of young girls who have wanted babies because they wanted someone to love that would love them back (usually because there own childhood sucked).    Of the ones that had babies (and they all REALLY wanted them) some turned out great mums and others realised being a mum wasnt asn't great as they thought and regreted their decision|`|AKjME08Maa	hi, im 14 and 34 weeks pregnant. the way you talk about wanting a baby is so aspiring and natural. my best friend came to visit me and wouldnt leave my bump alone. my pregnancy wasnt planned, i really do wish it could of happened when i was 16 or something but i have so much support from family and hospitals. Being so young is really hard though, i go out shopping with my family and i get about 50 death stares and people laughing and talking about me. i usually end up in tears but its really worth it. I havnt been informed on any risks to have it when your young. Just really, if your going to be able to cope with it and financial issues. WHICH IS MAJOR! You're sane and totally normal, i loved babies before i was pregnant, i am so happy i am now. My advice to you, is if you really want one soon, wait till your at least 16,17. It'll be alot easier so you can do more schooling, get a job and save money. And find a decent guy who will stick by you. good luck!|`|tLXD3yOWaa	you're right it's most likely not a phase  some people just realize that they want to be a parent sooner than others do and there is nothing wrong with that  and i give you credit for thinking rationally enough to realize that you want to wait until you are older so i give you no criticism.  i know plenty of teen mothers who have had wonderful happy healthy babies, it has nothing to do with age it's all on you and your health while and before you are pregnant.  but i do ask you not to just rush into something and have a child because everyone deserves to have something resembling a family. I grew up without my father and it's made a huge impact on my life; one that I think about every day.  I know that you are going to love your child no matter what happens but you want to make sure that your child has no reason not to love you back.|`|gJDPrl6maa	wow just reading that i can hear your biological clock ticking over here. I use to feel the same way as you. I wanted a baby sooooooo bad. My sisters were having them and getting so much attention and i felt so left out.  My sisters are also 7 year and 9 year ahead of me.. Im now 21.. So then when i turned 16 and was able to work. My first job was at a daycare. despite the long days cleaning up after  4/5 year olds i always managered to make it to the infants and 2/3s room I LOOOVVEEDD babys. I had a steady boyfriend that i thought i would be with forever and we both decided to try for a baby but nothing ever happened so i gave up i choose to love my neices and nephews as my own. And oh the htoddlers loved me i played with them we had fun. But in real honesty the terrible twos is what made me decide not to have a baby. I couldnt handle tempertantrums. They drove me insane!!!!!literally i wanted to SCREAM. But i never did i just bit my tongue and went to the infants room. well in there we had a child that was taken into a foster home almost a year old and the little girl didnt know how to walk crawl roll over nothing!! i felt so bad so when the physical therepy lady came to help i would help her and theni also realized this is hard. and like on the nights i really wanted to do something. My sisters would ask em to babysit and me being the loving sister that i am i would drop everything i had just to watch them . dont gt me wrong i loved doing it but .. i became their built in babysitter and it drove me nuts. My niece was 4 her brother was 3 and the other sisters baby was 2. And they wre more of a handle then the kids at daycare i could send them home my nieces and nephews i was stuck with. I dont want to give you too many storys but my Boyfriend now his mother had him when she was 15 he was born  2 months early then less thana year later she gets pregnant again. and then about 1 1/2 gets pregnant again. this time she gives her son up for adoption to her mother. then yeah guess what she gets pregnant about 2 years later and yes again another one 2 years later so allof her kids range from 25,24,22,19,18 so by the time she was roughly 21 she had a litter.. And it was rough for her they never had anything. So you might wanna wait till your atleast 18. by then your an adult and can make your own decisions wisely. b/c truely wisedom does come with age.  you wont have a deformed baby but you are at risk for a premature baby. and i read on some site the reason some women are getting cervical cancer is b/c the are having sex at too young of and age.. now i dont know if that is true or not i just read it. You sound like you know a lot about what you want but please wait. I got pregnant at 19 carried him over my 20th bday and delivered him my 21st year. 6 months before my 21bday. And even now its hard...GL!!! i hope the best for you!!!|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	lol its weird because this is like daja vu for me.. i've wanted a child since i was 13. i'm soon to be 19 in feb. you have something called Baby Fever. i have it real bad too.     i remember i wanted everything you wanted. i dreampt about babies, i baby sat since i was 13 to just be around babies. when i went shopping i went through the baby isles to see everything. i remember i thought every month could this be it? could i be pregnant? could my wish finally come true. i didn't care if i was pregnant, and my parents would tell me to get a abortion, i wouldn't care because i knew i would be pregnant till i had to have a abortion..     i'm engaged now we have had a few close calls but i've come to realize, just because you want a child doesn't mean, you have the right lifestyle for a child. once your child is born its all about your baby. not you.     honey you haven't even gone to prom yet. believe me.. just wait it will come sooner than you think.. what you can do in high school is take a family living class.  they have a fake baby and is like a real baby you have to diaper, rock the baby, feed the baby and everything.. just please wait. i know what you are going through... you can't do it without a guy at your side..     if you want to e-mail back and forwardth about this my e-mail is     wolflover5@Comcast.net|`|UVwRSpDjaa	I think that what you feel is normal. You want someone to love you unconditionally (the baby) but honey you have many years to have a baby. I have many friends who were teen mothers and they love there kids but every single one of them said they wish they waited because they weren't ready to give up there lives at such a young age. Yes, it is expensive and you won't even be able to get a job because of your age. Is it fair to put these responsibilitys on your parents? Your not mentally ready for it. Trust me. I had my son at 22 and I don't even think I was ready. I go to community college and I struggle to make it to class and find sitters and get my homework done. The one thing you should know is being a parent takes responsibility, FUll responsibility. When you and you alone can provide for this child then I say have one. You will one day and believe me it will be wonderful. JUst wait. You need the right MAN (not boy) because father figures are very important!

rMNWd17saa	Don't let anyone scare you.  It is not that bad.  I've had 6 children.    The first three were vaginal w/ no anesthesia at all.  My 4th was vaginal w/an epidural.  My 5th was a c-section because she was 8.10oz, transverse (sideways) and up really high.  I had an appointment to be at the hospital at 10:00am to be prepped for a 12:00pm c-section.  On the way to the hospital, literally 2 blocks away from the hospital, I sneezed and my water broke!  I know now it sounds funny, but I was so scared.  I always delivered very quickly after my water was broken with other babies.  Sure enough, by the time we got to the third floor L&D there was a gushing river trailing me down the hall and I was having very strong painful contractions.  I was dilated to 4cm.  They ended up doing and emergency c-section.    With my 6th I chose to have a c-section.  She was 9 pounds.  We didn't find out til the began that she was breach and the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck 3 times.  If I had tried to deliver naturally the contractions would have strangled her.  I thank God I chose to have c-section!  This time the c-section went exactly perfectly!  I never felt a single contraction.  (however I did throw up while they were doing it, this is normal and it was just a little bit)  Anyway!  Here is what to expect!  They will schedule you to come to hospital.  No food or water for 12 hours before hand.  They will do some blood work.  Shave you (the incision is very low, below bikini line)  Hook you up to an IV.  They usually want you to have 2 bags of fluid before the anesthesiologist comes in.  They will roll you into the operating room where they will explain what will happen.  (hubby or support person will put on scrubs over their clothes and join you around the time you are getting your epidural or spinal block)  They will have you sit up on gurney with legs over the side, bend over making a C with your back.  This will open up the spaces between your spine so that the can place the catheter.  You will have to be very still until they are done, very important!  The the will lay you down. Then they will insert a urine catheter, you won't feel it.  Put up a screen between your chin and chest, place your arms out to sides give you oxygen.  They will ask you if you feel anything.  It is normal to feel pressure but you won't feel any pain whatsoever.  it is a weird feeling because you can feel them pushing and pulling around in your stomach and the release of pressure as baby comes out.  You will hear your baby cry.  You will probably cry too :-)  They will bring baby around for you to see and kiss.  Then they will take baby to weigh and measure and do the apgar score, all this should be in same room and where you can watch.  They will be stitching you up.  The whole surgery will take about 10 minutes.  They will take you to recovery til you can move your toes, then to your room with baby.  They will remove the urine catheter when you can get up and go to the restroom on your own. The will keep you an pain meds as long as you need them.  Don't wait til they wear off to ask for more as they take a while to start working. They will want you to get up and move around as soon as you can.  The first time it will hurt sitting up.  It will feel like your insides are going to fall out.  They won't!  To ease the pain, hold a pillow firmly against your abdomen as you sit up and when you cough or sneeze.  This helps alot!  Each time you get up the pain will be less and less.  The more you walk around the quicker you will heal and feel better.  I was walking all over the halls by that evening.  You will have a sanitary napkin across the incision to keep it clean and dry.  Be sure to continue this when you get home til you see dr again.  They use staples in the outside (stitches on inside layers will dissolve on their own)  Staples will be removed before you leave the hospital.  Just feels like a little pinch. Not too bad.  Then you will go home and enjoy baby.  Avoid carrying anything heavier than baby and going up and down stairs for a couple of weeks.    I hope this helps!  I know it was a little long but I think you should know what it will be like.  It really is not bad.  To me it was much more painful going through labor, delivery and episiotomy than the c-section.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	C sections are done daily all across our country. Please don't be afraid. Your recovery time will be a bit longer but that's it. You'll be just fine & you have to believe that.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	I had two vaginal delivery's and 1 C-Section. The Section was so much easier than the vaginal. I was up moving by the next day. Everyone heals in there own way. Personally though C-Section is so much easier.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Not bad at all!!!  Who told you that? (i'll beat 'em up for you)    Some women say vaginal births are horrible.  I have had both.   I have also had (three) c-sections.   They are not bad.   No reason to be scared. (Unless it is an emergency!)  My first one was an emergency and it was terrifying.Scheduled ones are better!!    Three days you are in the hospital unless you are doing well...  Don't listen to any negative stories.   It will scare you.  I only bled for 10 days after. That is a bit unusual I am told. IT can be a lot longer or not.   Make sure you get birth control.   You never know. I had sex sooner afterward, too.   Good luck and feel free to email me if you want more details or anything.|`|eDnWMm3maa	It was the worst experience of my life.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Whoever told you that is wrong!! I have had 3 c-sections and will be having my 4th april 14th. I think the only thing i dread is the anxiety of going into the OR...other then that whats not to love...you wake up..go to the hospital...and have a baby. No labor, no waiting around for hours on end etc. I didnt feel ANY pain during my c-section. Was a bit sore for the first week but nothing horrible. I was able to get up and walk around the next day...minor pain is expected due to the fact that you just had surgery but your so over joyed with your new baby that it doesnt even really phase you. You will be fine and dont listen to anyone. Congrats on your pregnancy and goodluck with your c-section.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I have 6 children and the last two were C-sections. The first was an emergency c-section, and I will tell you that the recovery was awful and LONG! With my second I was not given the option of VBAC since my last one was only 9 weeks old when I got pregnant again. This was a scheduled c-section. The recovery after the first 4 days was a breeze! I personally think that it helps a lot if it is scheduled, therefore, your body does not labor prior to the delivery.|`|TNgkWQHMaa	I wouldn't know how getting a C-section is.     I am told that you are sore for a bit afterwards and that you have to stay in the hospital a little longer. But look on the bright side, you bleed less afterwards! (I'm told)     And your little angel will be so worth it! You wont even care once you see that perfect little face!|`|OjUjwrL4aa	In my opinion, YES its that bad. I was induced with my son, but I was making NO progress because he was stuck so we had to do an emergency c-section. WOW! The amount of pressure and pulling and tugging you feel is phenomenal. While they were sewing me up, I started to lose it so they put me out. When they woke me up, they didn't have my morphine pump yet so I was in a lot of pain. I'm talking massive amounts of pain. I have never in my life felt that kind of excruciating pain before. When they told me the next day that I was going to have to stand up, I just about died. The more you move around, the easier it gets though so try to stand and walk as soon as you feel like you can. I'm a weenie  with pain though so maybe its not as bad for some women.|`|24P6A0oaaa	NO! it's actually easier and less painful than natural birth!  I had my first c section because he wouldn't come out, you dont feel any pain during the surgery, just  the scar will be very sore for a week to three  I have a scheduled one too in may. I get to skip all the contractions (unless I am early)  dont be scared, really it is not that bad!
TJusfEnlaa	LoL!! OK then....<br>  If you are worried about if you are the father or not, I would first confront your wife, and then if you are still not satisfied, take a DNA test.<br>  How old is the baby?<br>  I personally think that newborns are all quite ugly, in there little alien like way. but as they get older, more of there true looks emerges, so just because you think the baby is ugly, its not to say they aren't going to change!!<br>  My son is 9 months old and he doesn't look anything at all like he did when he was newborn. In fact, i can't even believe they are the same person!! And he was a bit alien looking but now is a right little spunk.|`|Jswomud7aa	you are ridiculous|`|n6XYYyoLaa	probably got ur genes; most nbs look wrinkly and such ...have u at least waited for his head to round out before saying he's 'ugly'? that's sad, poor baby...|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	just because a store closes at 9 dose not mean she is done work. My b/f works at a store and it closes at 10 but dosent get out until 11 or 12, you have to put money away, get everyone out of the store, clean up the store, inventory sometimes, my b/f is a cashier and if you dont think the kid is yours then get a paternity test, if its not yours leave her and if it is, i would still leave and just pay support cause that child dose not need a scum bag like you in its life, although i have a strong feeling your a troll and your just posting this for kicks, but the sad thing is there are really people out there who are like this.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Old wives tail says that two beautiful parents make ugly kids... LOL!<br>  <br>  Okay seriously though I doubt this is a real question.|`|EeGgovyCaa	You must be bored. Why don't you go flex your tiny muscles in front of a mirror, you sorry excuse for a boy.|`|sEihaeLNaa	LOL MAYBE YOUR THE UGLY ONE AND JUST DONT SE IT!|`|PccHbsKbaa	well i am also a cashier and there are many nights that i dont gethome till 11 and our store closes at 9. && i have never seen an ugly baby, but your best bet is to get a DNA test.|`|5bqKLMg0aa	It is possible that your baby will be beautiful when it grows bigger. Give it some time and relax, everything should be fine.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Don't you know tow beautiful people usually have ugly kids?  Look at celebrity babies for example.  Or maybe you just think too highly of yourself and you're really only average.|`|62cQv3z3aa	that  is really mean all babies are cute.... do you know if it is your baby or not|`|4iXL4C6paa	get a DNA test...and I am sure he looks just like you|`|nhgQKvwEaa	that's mean.|`|FXINmF6saa	I'm dorry but you are very conceited and are full of yourself. You will be very sorry by saying this about this baby who you are not sure is not yours. Do a DNA test then when you get proved that's your kid you'll be thinking you aren't so handsome. And I'm still trying to figure out why you have been with this girl it you're so "sure" that she's been screwing around. Why have you been supporting her when the baby was in her tummy. You should have left her since that day she came home late. You must not be so hot if she's been messing with guys uglier then you. It seems to me that it's your baby but you don't want to take financial responsibility for him. If she's so beautiful stay with her and love that baby because like it or not you signed paternity papers meaning that baby is legally yours!|`|KsubM4Y2aa	???<br>  You sure? Have the tests shown it's not your baby? Because maybe you two pretty people weren't different enough to be compatible, I don't know.<br>  <br>  Just don't give up on the poor soul. If you are not plain crazy, do the tests to know if it's your baby first. And if it is, try to care for it. Even a programmer doesn't throw a code away if it isn't good at the start.<br>  <br>  You can still make another one, but have heart and care for this one too.<br>  <br>  Still, do the tests stuff to calm your doubts first.|`|GENu0nksaa	Unlike most people, i understand your situation. Your just mad because you think your wife is cheating on you. And i think you have a right to mad in this situation. You cant control what your baby will come out to look like. Its whatever genetics are passed from the father through his sperm, and the mother through her egg. <br>  <br>  But if you are really this concerned that this child is not yours, take a DNA test. This will confirm if the child is yours, and if your wife had sex with someone other then you. <br>  <br>  If she did cheat, try to forgive her. If you really loved her, you wouldn't get a divorce.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!|`|aJ1zXhi2aa	i got to tell you  not all new born  baby are  going to come out cute or anything..when my mom had her last  child ..man i tell yuh the baby was fat , ugly had baby wrinkles 3 days later my baby  sister definetly look lik a cute baby and a normal size baby .. so it takes times for a new born  baby to look  normal...so yuh cant say yet  why do you have to financial this ugly baby because yuh do not kno if its not your baby yet|`|LcqtYjTtaa	Congrats on your ugly bastard child, lmao|`|36c0oKojaa	No baby are ugly|`|Vbkrazkvaa	mmmm i bet you is a beautiful man suga|`|MdgLHHd3aa	*just dies laughing*|`|blTcyvieaa	Yeah! That's how they do you man! Man my ***** was all like "how dare you doubt your own flesh and blood after I carried him for 11 months!". Well I read a damn brochure and it don't take no damn 11 months to have a baby! Not unless you're an elephant and I gave that **** up after college! Anyways, the ***** is all like "I never had a life while I was with you! I'm just starting to get out in the world!" and I'm like "***** we met at a clun next to a porn shop and thats where we bought those defective condoms that made you get a late term abortion!". Naturally she started crying, but i pressed the unpause button to Gears of War II and kept kickin ***. Anyways. I feel your pain man, I say go after child support on her next time she leaves the house, and then lock the door on her and tell them she's off doing meth with her Skinhead boyfriend.<br>  <br>  And no, not all babies are cute! They look like damn La Chupacabras when they first come out and some don't evolve over time. Babies suck!
b26Dp8LKaa	Click on the following link for information about adoption requirements by state, including North Carolina:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/state/" rel="nofollow">http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/l...</a><br>  <br>  Once the adoption is final, he'll receive an amended birth certificate showing your name as his father. I respectfully suggest that you & his mom keep a copy of his original birth certificate for him. He may never want it. As an adoptee, it's one thing most of us can't have & wish we could (no matter how much we love our parents).  <br>  <br>  Also, please never say in your son's presence anything about his other "father" not wanting him. Whether it's the truth or not. It's very painful for a child to grow up believing that your own parent didn't want you. And that pain stays with us into adulthood. Tell your son that his other "father" wasn't ready for the responsibility of being a father. And leave it there.  Even if he wants to meet the guy one day, he'll love you just the same - and probably even more. <br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful!  Good Luck!|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	You have to be married in most states, sometimes for a certain period of time, before you can have a step-parent adoption.  I'm not sure on the price, I assume a family court lawyer would have a good idea of the costs involved, and what the father would need to do to sign away his rights.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	You need to contact a family lawyer.
CyzGne4Saa	Sounds like he has Thrush...my son had that when he was around 2wks old. He will need meds from his doctor so make sure to call first thing in the morning!|`|d00c1b30c2ed5a94f8ae20eeecfaa314aa	I was just reading this:<br>  <br>  Strange signs of Strep<br>  <br>  Strep Impetigo<br>  A rash usually around the nose or mouth. It starts of as red sores that rupture within a few days and form yellowish crusts. Kids get impetigo when bacteria invade a cut in the skin or nasal lining.<br>  <br>  Genital Strep<br>  Pimples or a bright-red rash, possibly with a white coating, in the genital area. When strep throat or impetigo is going around, kids can spread the bacteria below the belt. Anal strep causes painful bowel movements, and your child might complain of a sore bottom. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Take him to the doctor. Good luck!|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	It sounds like thrush. Thrush is a yeast infection in his mouth. That could also be what is causing the rash around his penis. They will probably give him nystatin oral suspension, and maybe a nystatin cream for this diaper area. It should clear it up within a couple of days. Also you can feed him yogurt with active cultures in it. That might help.<br>  Good Luck!|`|Ym1vJtXfaa	white tongue could be associated with nursing - yeast or thrush<br>  red spots on penis is likely an allergic reaction or early stages diaper rash/<br>  good luck.|`|6OFHemITaa	Well, it could be thrush although thats usually in infants!  Check with the doctor.|`|Jswomud7aa	Yeast infection most likely, take him to your doctor.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	mouth sounds like thrush, not sure about the spots on his penis, i am sure the doc can help you there...|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Sounds like thrush on his tongue. You can wipe his tongue off with a washcloth after he eats until you get to your doctor.  That might just be a diaper rash. You can put cream on before you put a new diaper on. I use Butt Paste on my son when he gets those red spots. It helps clear them up.|`|vLJKNkNLaa	The red spots are normal, and could be caused by<br>  a: diaper rash<br>  b. complications during delivery (it will go away in 3-6 months)<br>  White tongue:<br>  a. bad brushing habits<br>  b. insufficient diet<br>  <br>  even so, you should see a doctor.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Sounds like thrush.. although if his tongue is red with the white spots in could be scarlet fever - especially if he has a rash. Our son had scarlet fever when he was 1 1/2 - I had no idea people still got that but apparently they do.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	It sounds like yeast. His doctor can give you something for that.<br>  <br>  Has he been on antibiotics recently?
UTjWlj9Yaa	I am 20 years old and 18 weeks pregnant with my older boyfriend. We have much of the same situation but you know what, you have to think of YOU and your baby instead of other people. You're going to have to put everyone else, including your boyfriend, second to your child. Things happen for a reason- getting pregnant on birth control.... that was Me! But guess what, I am taking care of my responsibilities. I was a big enough girl to have sex so I can deal with the consequences. You need to write a list of questions that you have: How will I finish college? Who is here to support me as far as family and friends? Does the school I attend offer additional funding and day care for my child so I can finish school? Will I have enough money to feed myself and my child? Can I go on social assistance in order to get things together?     You have to pretend your boyfriend won't be there. Will you be able to do this on your own/with the help of your family?     Weight the pros vs. the cons and then come up with a conclusion. You either keep your baby or you don't. I was very pro-choice untill I found myself pregnant then I went to an ultrasound, listened to my babies heartbeat and could never ever ever imagine getting rid of the little angel inside of me. Things seem bad now but they will get better. Everyone around me is so excited and can't wait untill I give birth.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you aren't ready you do have options.|`|6avKnzkoaa	Do what is best for yourself. It's your body and ultimately your decision. Perhaps you should see a counsellor and they might be able to help you out and discuss with you all the options out there available to you. I wish you the best of luck ~|`|cSm1zod4aa	No it is definitely not wrong to be feeling like that, don't let anyone make you feel bad. You were trying to prevent something you werent ready for and unfortunately it does happen. The best thing for you to do is discuss it with your boyfriend. Sit down have a serious discussion and come up with what the best decision would be for you. I am against abortion, it obviously happened for a reason, everything does. But in all honesty you 2 just have to do what is right for your situation.|`|47R03TbFaa	PLEASE DON'T HAVE AN ABORTION  FIND A FAMILY WHO WOULD LOVE THE CHILD IF YOU DON'T AND THE FATHER DON'T WANT IT BUT PLEASE GIVE YOUR SELF A CHANCE AND RAISE YOUR CHILD YOUR FAMILY WOULD HELP IF THEY KNEW BUT DON'T KILL YOUR BABY BECAUSE A ABORTION CAN LEAVE YOU NOT HAVING KIDS EVER AGAIN IF SOMETHING WRONG  WAS TO HAPPEN  GOOD LUCK TO YOU IN YOUR DECISION AND WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Do what you think is best for you and your unborn child.|`|weA0Xdszaa	A lot of people here are against abortion and will tell you to give the child for adoption or keep it. But in the end, it's YOUR decision and it's about what YOU think and feel is right. Follow your guts, even if it's the hardest thing you ever did. But take the time to think it through as regrets can haunt you for a long time. Good luck sweetie don't let anybody judge you...|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	if your not ready for a baby but you dont want to give it up and no abortion please email me at katherineajsexy@aol.com  and i can really talk to you.|`|b6356b9558163864dfaed163316ee3b1aa	Do an open adoption, so you can still be in your childs life, but you wont have to worry about other things. Please dont abort though :(|`|fIUr49ujaa	Sweetie raising a baby isn't easy but is can be done.  I raised three on my own and I was only 22.  There are places that can help you where you can finish college.  Please don't go through an abortion.  If you knew how they do it I am sure that would not even go threw you mind.  Adoption is also an option.|`|VMhLrPWraa	You should go through with it. There are 15 year olds at my school that are pregnant and they are doing just fine with the acception of challenges here and there but they don't plan on getting abortions. You shouldnt take your own life out on another. If a 15 year old can do it so can you. If you still want to expierience other things in life, you still can with the child. You just need to get a part time job or something and hire a nanny to watch over him/her. It's your choice though so please don't take other peoples opinions off of yahoo answers. Do what you think is best for you. I hope I helped though! =) Good Luck and I hope all is well with you and your boyfriend!|`|A5KbJEH1aa	Wow poor thing, yeah i understand ay..  The first time i fell pregnant about a year ago..  I was in a similar situation, i hadn't finished school,  My boyfriend was really nasty and my family and I really didn't get along and i ended up falling pregnant on the pill too.  I decided to keep the baby and leave my partner becuase i knew even though i didnt get along with my parents they would fully support me, and they did. I ended up miscarrying at 12 weeks, it killed me so so much, and i didnt understand why, i barely wanted this baby when i fell pregnant so why was i so upset, my boyfriend ended up straightening out after i miscarried and we ended up getting back together and after 3 months trying for a baby. I am now 37 weeks pregnant with a bubby boy..  What i'm trying to get at is even though you feel your not ready,  No one is ready when they first fall pregnant, thats why we have 9 months to get ready, that's 9 months to read books, 9 months to learn, 9 months for people to chnage (your boyfriend?) 9 months to gain support, and 9 months to figure out who you want to keep in you and your baby's life.  But in saying that no one has a right to judge if you want to abort,  its completely upto you, but if you chose to abort just make sure next time you use condoms or sumthing aswel.  Its gonna be confusing but you just need to really really sit down and think things through but i have a feeling that if you abort you might regret it, if your even questioning aborting then obviously you dont really wanna do it deep down. Just think things through, and there is other support out there, if your boyfriend wants to be an idiot about it you dont need him..  Just make sure you really think things through.  Good Luck!|`|xAlTGs9Iaa	Abortion (in more than 98% of cases) is for SELFISH reasons.   Women DONT NEED a man with them to have a baby.. look at army wives.. airforces wives.. anyone, not to mention single mothers.     It seems like you (like other people who wig out after getting pregnant) make excuses for having an abortion. if you don't want the baby put it up for adoption, many MANY people cant have kids.. and would give up almost anything for one.     stop having sex if u dont want a baby. dont kill the baby bc u KNOW birth control only works 99% of the time...    this is YOuR fault and if you abort it, you ARE commiting murder..|`|7lkclHF0aa	I think you should have the baby... It's part of you... And right now you may want to put ur boy friend first but you might regret getting an abortion when your older. Personaly a baby is the greatest joy of life.|`|UjWlmKLEaa	I think that if you guys don't feel like you can have a baby & take care of it together right now, you could have it & let someone adopt it. I just hate the thought of abortion so that would be my choice....Good luck|`|H9nQUe7Zaa	if you abort you might regret it later in life  trust me (from personal experience). but it is your desion to make . the worst feeling is watching your friends have there children and watching how happy they are throughout the whole experience.|`|8tQyn8LMaa	Well, I am 21 with a 2yr old. My son was a bc pill baby so yes unexpected but never a mistake in our minds. At the time my husband and i had only been dating 4mnths. Now we are husband and wife best ever. To me babies come for reasons they are a blessing. My husband and i were very rocky at the time but once we knew we were indeed pregnant our fights seemed to dissapear we were all about the baby and needs....  Now would i change it no but later in life sure would have been better for him but.. After my son was born i went to college and got my career started.  So dont think that just cuz your having a baby doesnt mean your world completely stops! I was 18 when i found out 2wks b4 highschool graduation!! So if anything i believe you have a better start than i did and if i did it you can too..  Plus i feel if you can lay down and willingly have sex knowing there is a tiny chance of pregnancy than you shall deal with the results!  Good luck! only you can decide whats best|`|3WccV3Kzaa	Yes you are confused  it is a hard thing being pregnant  for one thing babies don't come with instructions  I am a grandfather and I love my children and grandchildren having a baby is the greatest thing you can get  they are a bundle of joy and also can be a mess at the same time. as far as you being confused it is a natural thing but once you see the baby and know it came from you  it is a joy you never forget I know 22 it young and you might not be ready but with god and family help I think  you can have a normal life  being pregnant is one step in life that you never know when it might happen all you have to do is accept it and go on.

46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	3rd of September!    And you are 9 weeks pregnant!    COngrats|`|SY8b17Ldaa	8th august 2009 you r 12 weeks and 5 days|`|6vwn3cEeaa	You should count 40 weeks from the first day of your last period, if you typically have a 28 day menstrual cycle. This will give you an estimated due date.     If you were using a fertility monitoring system like many of the over the counter ovulation tests you can buy at the pharmacy, you would count 38 weeks from the date you think you conceived.     In either case, you can google "due date calculator" and you will find many online calculators that will give you an estimated due date based on the first day of your last period or the date you ovulated if known. Many of these calculators let you change the length of your menstrual cycle if you' don't have the average 28 day cycle.    Doctors now don't really tend to commit to a due date because most women don't deliver on their due date. This is because when you use the 40 week calculation, it's assumed you conceived 2 weeks after the first day of your last period. The average female has a 28 day menstrual cycle, and would therefore ovulate approximately 2 weeks after the first day of their period. Women who have shorter or longer menstrual cycles often ovulate differently than someone with the average 28 day cycle. Some women who have 28 day cycles ovulate later in their cycle, making the 2 week estimate just that, an estimate.    Also, some woman carry babies longer. The normal gestational period is 38-40 weeks, but some women carry to 42. It all depends on when the baby is done developing and when your body is ready to deliver.    When you are given your due date, you can expect to deliver anytime in the 2 weeks before that date or the 2 weeks following, providing you have a normal pregnancy.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	See a doctor for an ultrasound.|`|SnanuNKiaa	go to babyzone.com/calander. its extremely accurate. i'm using it to track my pregnancy.|`|8YhITQ7laa	you doctor should be able to tell you this. get a calender and go up 40 weeks. Dont go by months because a month actually has more than 4 weeks and some obviously has more days than other months. Congrats on the pregnancy
8WbfmK5daa	Addison :)|`|ZPxmuy2Naa	I love the name addison.<br>  Charolette is an old name but it is okay.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good choices|`|mRQxlNH5aa	That's a hard one, I've always like Charlotte...Charli for short, it's one of my favorites. I also really like Addison and Addie for short...I'm even really liking Adelynn right now. I'd have to go with Addison though. Both great choices.|`|heC9aQ18aa	Addison.<br>  Charolette looks weird to me like you tried to spall Charlotte and couldn't. I choose Addison. Nice name and spelled correctly.

I'd spell it with a "Y" though. Addyson means Child of Adam and is of English origin. It's #14 on 2008's most popular name list (for girls), so great choice! You could call her Addy, Sonny, Ad, Adds, and Addis! I love your choices, but Charlotte is way too old-fasioned for me. Sorry. But if you still like it, make that a middle name, unless you already have a middle name chosen. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Always,<br>  (-:Tabbykinz:-)|`|KYyP8Dtraa	Addison is my favorite!!<br>  <br>  Very cute names though =)|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Addison|`|c34ff1f2d66a580bdbc491850122d151aa	addison but i actually like them both|`|MyUx7Bp0aa	I love both of the names, but since Addison will be called 'Addie', then Charlotte.|`|YRUf6BoWaa	i like addison|`|Ru66gqUXaa	Why not both? although i like addison more, like 52% more|`|6v4Gblxkaa	Im assuming it's supposes to be for a girl.<br>  I choose Charolette only because Addison means son of Adam.|`|R65kAyVJaa	Addison.

qxnZXOVFaa	that statement is totally false, but all the other facts stated on that site are true.  hot tub water is way too hot for sperm to survive in.  sperm is produced and stored in the man's scrotum simply because of the fact that it's too warm inside the body cavity.  that's why there is a sac outside of the man's body for the sperm to thrive.  while sperm can't "swim" through underwear or across skin, it is likely that if the emission was that close to the vagina, some may have gotten in, or if there was actual penetration there is a very high possibility of pre-ejaculate being released inside the woman and that contains sperm, also.|`|Spm9Raz9aa	when sperm is exposed to oxygen for hardly any time they die....they cannot swim through underwear|`|AA11762804	sperm can go through underwear, they are microscopic organisms, it is very unlikely that the woman can become pregnant but it is possible|`|y4E8EoZ2aa	The only thing I know is sperm can live as long as they are moist....once it dries then the sperm die....sorry I couldn't help more.|`|UxwjpsKQaa	this would be a good question to call up a sperm bank and ask hahaha..|`|AA10196172	Sperm can live about 10 minutes to half an hour depending on the conditions. Keep in mind, toohot, too cold, too acid or basic and it's dead. Usually the chlorine in pools or hot tubs, and the soap in a bath is enough to do them in. SO don't really worry there. Unless it's a hot bath, it's not body temp and that will do it in. Piping hot does them in too.    The warning for people using timing is that in the ideal environment- the uterus - they can live 2 or 3 days, some say up to five.    Don't believe the "they die immediately on exposure to oxgen" stuff. Ajournalist once was describing producing a sample and getting it to the doctor for a sperm count. He had to keep the tube under his armpit for body temp and be there within half an hour. Then he got pulled over by the cops and was trying to act natural...     Suzanne Sommers describes getting pregnant in her autobiography. She was wearing nylon undies, but he was pushing up into her when he let fly - in that case they miht as ell not be there. Anything that leaks through, sperm can go thorugh, including tiny pinholes in a condom. But sperm will only go through clothes if forced through by an ejaculation or if there's almost no distance. It's not like they follow a roadmap for several feet.    ANyway, nobody's gotten pregnant in a swimming pool or bath except by having sex.|`|RrPjG9x9aa	sperm die without the proper pH balance.....hot tub water can't provide that.|`|i8Ch743Laa	It takes up to an hour or so for it to die once it's hit the air. All the other stuff is false info though,it takes a little more time for it to die than you'd think.|`|fFoC2RGnaa	LOL thats the funniest shiz ever. it cud be possible...like 1 out of a 1,000,000th chance of it happening.    and yes, sperm dies within 24hrs exposed to air.  and it dies within 2-3 days inside the vagina, if the sperm doesnt find the egg..|`|ehvzQRkkaa	No its not true  I would die fairly quickly once hitting air  You need penetration to get pregnant!|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Ask the sperm bank.

AA11481862	I would say Davin - unique, and people won't really know the meaning of it,,and it definitely sounds tough.  Colton as well sounds tough too! =) both of them do.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Colton sound tougher    Do you want to know what people like better?|`|sOgLLlDraa	Love both these names!

PLbmKNpvaa	I've heard that if you use a toilet roll on your tummy someone can often hear the heartbeat after 26 weeks. I haven't tried this to find out if it's true but I'm 29 weeks and DH could hear thuds (although whether that was bubs kicking or his heart I'm not sure lol) without a toilet roll to amplify it. The heartbeat monitors that you can hire/but would definately work but I don't recommend them because if you don't hear anything it can worry you for no reason when it's just because bubs is on a funny angle and you haven't gotten the right spot to listen to.|`|W9amt8xEaa	Yep sure will :)  I heard my niece's heartbeat on one at 24 weeks and 3 days. :)   You should hear it just fine.|`|wWGNvMIQaa	I am 37 weeks and my husband still can't hear the heart beat when he puts his head to my belly. We bought one of those sound amplifying fetal heartbeat things and I heard the heart beat on it for the first time at 35 weeks! My suggestion, don't waste your money on one.|`|6avKnzkoaa	I'm not sure, but I know you can hear it with a normal stethoscope and you can always use a doppler monitor.
2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	After reading tons of reviews, I got a sealy mattress from babiesrus.  My son is 9 months old, and it has held up really well (he jumps up and down in his crib while he's waiting for me to come and get him in the mornings.<br>  <br>  In fact he managed to shake the screws loose from his original crib, we ended up getting a safer heavier crib, but we checked the mattress and it was still firm and perfect.|`|Jswomud7aa	Colgate. It has great support and well worth the money.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	we got the wendy bellisimo; it was supposed to be the top of the line at the store we got it; we have been well pleased; it has plenty of coils to use as crib and toddler bed, has ventilation, firm but comfy, fits well, ....good luck....|`|WxQFe0GYaa	The best one is the one that fits snug in your crib (no spaces around the edges between the mattress and the rungs of the crib) and the firmest one you can find.  There are different brands that have good mattresses.
UUpsa35Daa	If he isn't being physically hurt where you need to reprimand and talk to the other person then you should just take him to his room and talk to him calmly and ask him to talk to you about what's going on. Toddlers are more aware than we think, he'll be able to tell in his own way how he's feeling. Then try to explain to him that he needs to be nice and share with other people so everyone can be happy. Or that, the other person didn't mean to hurt him, they were just trying to have fun.    He's crying for a reason...he's upset...you might not think it's a big deal, but he does. You should want to find out what's wrong so you can get him to settle down and feel better.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	My oldest one did that too. Hes now 5 and still cries pretty easily but its nothing like it used to be. Hes just very emotional and thats the way he deals with stress and anger and sadness etc. He'll grow out of it.   For my son we would just tell him that its ok, we understand that he is upset and gave him options on how to fix the situation instead of crying. Also we would ask him if crying is going to solve his situation, he would say no and then he would work on solving the problem instead of sitting around and crying about it|`|EMKuBql8aa	Maybe start by stop calling him names, no parent should be calling their child a "cry baby"    He is sensitive, it's ok, try to talk to him calmly instead of berating him. If you don't give it too much attention, he will grow out of it eventually, probably around 5 years old.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Is he getting enough sleep? Kids that are ill equipt to deal with life's ups and downs are sometimes not lacking in anything but a good sleep schedule. Does he sleep 11-12 hours a night and have a nap each day? If not, start there, if so then use some behavior modification strategies to extinguish the behavior. Meaning:  praise the positive like crazy and when he is whining or crying, ask him to use his words and remind him and give him phrases that would be appropriate to say. He may lack the verbal skills to express himself at 2, and you can help him a great deal by helping him learn those skills. Good Luck|`|9mSIQA2Baa	Just ignore or send him to his bed/time-out/room.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	Give him a hug, comfort his tears (very briefly), then distract him, and encourage him onto another activity. Just smile brightly, say, look at this. That is a nice toy, but look at this one. This truck . . . (is red and look at the cool wheels!) Don't make a big deal of it all, but help him go on with things. If you find you can even avert the first step and go right into the distraction, find something else to do, then maybe he will forget it even more quickly. As soon as he begins to forget the problem, he will probably be able to deal with it more quickly the next time it happens. You can also try other things such as tickling him to get him to laugh, and then distracting him to another activity, toy, etc. Learning to find alternatives to things helps. If it continues and you are not finding any resolve in these measures, you could then sit down with him and ask what is wrong. But he is young and you don't want to put too much into this phase and encourage it to blossom. Children go through phases and just need help getting past them and growing.|`|efmjyiJ4aa	Hes just really sensite, my little brother was the same way. I have a two year old right now, and hes a little touchy here and there- its a phase he will grow out of.|`|Q3Hp2Al6aa	crying baby article http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...

01Mu3wUeaa	"and they also killed one of my grandma's dogs, so we only have three dogs left"  awww.      That makes me want to slap the dispatchers.The poor girl is explaining it all and they just as her over again.    If they called the police, the kid won't be calling!      That poor little girl sure was brave.I would have freaked the **** out if I was her age and they shot my family members.    I hope those kids aren't too messed up from that.|`|lGcpXteaaa	That made me choke up :(  How devastating.  I hope her and her siblings are ok!    I think its very important to teach children what to do when their is an emergency! This just proves it.   What a brave little girl.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	yes- its sad especially when he is alone with is 2 siblings with their mother and grandmother dead. My heart goes out to them.|`|AA10709259	Is this call for real? The dispatcher sounds quite dumb, she kept asking if the police came last night, when the kid already said they hadn't come.

My heart just goes out to her and her family.|`|rC2vLonRaa	omg i watch it. it makes me want to cry that is so sad if i was that little girl i would be bursting out into tears|`|aqKIOjHqaa	i feel very bad for the girl.  and all that happened to thier family.  how could people become so bad.  they don't feel something. such kind of people should be shot. as they caught.  no court. no orders.  just 1 click and the dust is out there.    well now i realise  the importance of teaching your kids the number, your address and other emergancy services.a little better.  thanks.|`|cg3IaThxaa	what?  that was a joke ...  "do you know who done this?"  that 9 year old would not be talking so quickly and calmly,   and every police in town would be there,  and the operator wouldn't be so damn stupid.   jeeeeez. you thought this was real?  ....  & something like that would deff. NOT be released on youtube.|`|I321VZYOaa	That is one of the saddest things I've ever heard, especially when he says "Their dead in my house and there's blood splattered everywhere." I would totally be freaking out if someone came in and shot my family.

That I agree, that little boy is extremely brave, much more then I would have ever been in that situation.|`|1ZsIEzrRaa	Wow, I'm surprised they didn't shoot him.  The person on the phone was so dumb.

hWc65sEtaa	Everyone does make mistakes.  Nobody is perfect.  Wait until you are late, then take a test.|`|DutTBV3caa	i dont think you'd be having signs 3 or 4 days after conception... but i'm 5 weeks and i've had cramping but no spotting. according to everything i've read i should be spotting any day now.  if i were you i'd take a test a few days before you're supposed to get your period. even if you are pregnant, you still have the same future and you dont need to be tied down to him. being pregnant doesnt ruin your life. its how you let the pregnancy hold you back that can chance how you want things to be.|`|gtTIILgyaa	It could be. the egg could be implanting....or, the stress could be getting to you...good luck.|`|NxNrZksXaa	3 or 4 days later is too soon! it takes about 2 weeks for implantation to occur and 2-3 weeks for any symptoms to show up. the blood and cramping could be your period coming early, or it could be due to rough sex. but no it is too soon to tell if you are pregnant, but you will need to take a test in about 3 more weeks if you start experiencing those things again|`|Uibr6n5Eaa	Well the cramping might be a sign of your upcoming period and the spots could possibly be the beginning of your period. It sounds like your stressed and that can definantly cause it to come early. Also, if you were having spotting, it would be more of a brown or light pink discharge. Well if you get too scared take a pregnancy test in a few days. I'll pray for you. I'm scared that I'm possibly pregnant too, but I'm beginning to think that Im not. I wish you the best of luck. Yes, we all do make mistakes.
2arZOZWgaa	Most babies are able to tolerate milk-based products once they have started other types of single food solids and have handled them well.  What "they" really mean by not giving you child whole milk until one year of age is that you child should be drinking breast milk and/or formula for their main source of nutrition. Once they have reached the one year milestone, and with their pediatrician's thumbs up, it is safe to begin giving them whole milk instead of formula or breast milk, though some parents continue to give their child formula or breast milk well beyond the first birthday.    Yogurt for a child well-adapted to eating other single ingredient foods is safe as well as soft cheese like colby, monterrey jack, and Parmesan. Also, cottage cheese is another option. I, by no means, would give this to a baby just starting solids or who has not been on solids for a few months.     My daughter who is almost 11 months loves colby jack cheese that I cut up for her into bite size pieces. She eats it as a snack or a compliment to a complete meal. I have also mixed cottage cheese and yogurt in with her fruit on occasion. She is also a very big fan of mac-n-cheese in which i use whole wheat noodles and grated cheese (not the packaged kind for a little one for me, just too many weird ingredients) and grilled cheese sandwiches (whole wheat bread and colby jack cheese slices) cut up so that she can hold it in her hand.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My 14 month is lactose intolerant. He eats yogurt, cheese, ice cream, etc. just fine, but can only drink Lactaid milk. My dr. tells me it is because the dairy containing products are more refined the milk itself. I have been feeding him foods containing milk since he was 7 mths. old!|`|6vS8SZemaa	actually my daughter was off formula and breast milk at 11 months the doctor told me to go ahead and switch to whole milk cause she just wasn't getting full anymore. We just Gave her baby foods and like 2 bottles of milk a day.|`|d017cc02830140e5398ad7c8d94a71e1aa	most time its after about 7 or 8 months that you can start switching them over to whole milk, talk to your pediatrician, it should be ok|`|2jnpvyzaaa	probably because da yogurt has enough fiber.da whole milk gets them constipated. this is my opinion|`|kRui5wGtaa	It is not so much that the baby cannot have milk before age 1 it is more that they NEED ALL that stuff in the breast milk/ formula until age 1.     I read somewhere that specialists fear that saying that whole milk is allowed means that parents will start to substitute the whole milk for formula and breast milk feeding.....which is 100% NOT okay. Whole milk doesn't have what breast milk and formula have to supply baby with all the essentials for their first year.     Things WITH whole milk in them are okay....unless there is some sort of reaction then make sure to call our doctor immediately. For peace of mind, ask baby's pediatrician if certain things with whole milk in them are okay.
8THz1sp9aa	I'm sure it's just your baby growing. I know after 20 weeks the baby grows at alarming speed, and we definitely feel it! I've had a few nights where I was cramping pretty bad as well, but the baby was still moving around like crazy as usual, and by the morning it was completely gone. How much did you weigh before you were pregnant? You may be just like me, I've always weighed 100 and my docter referred me to see a pyhsical therapist to excersize because the other night I woke up on my back (which i've always laid on my sides) and I had the worst pressure in my lower right back. It was like that of cramping when you first start your period, I could barely walk I was so scared. I went to the docter the next day and she did an ultrasound to put my mind at ease (mind you the pressure had disappeared after 30 minutes that night) everything was perfectly fine and the baby was moving around like usual. she said since i'm so small he probably hit or was laying on a nerve since i was on my back for so long. and sometimes it could even cause your legs to go numb, so its always best to lay on your side (preferrably left side so the baby gets all the blood flow) so yeah long story short you may want to try out physical therapy as well, i haven't made an appointment yet i wanted to do research before i went but everything i've read has said it works wonders so i'm definitely going to give it a try. good luck & congrats :)|`|6avKnzkoaa	It could be that your organs are getting squished by your growing uterus. As long as your baby is still moving you should be okay. It could also be pelvic pain and lower back pain due to the strain of carrying a baby 24/7. However, if it's really bothering you the pain, I would go and see a doctor and get it checked out. They might be able to give you something to ease the pain a bit. Best of luck ~|`|3ay0KVVDaa	I had that at 27 weeks and went to the hospital because the pain went on and on for HOURS ... alll day. I took a warm bath, tried to sleep and it didnt stop. So I went to the hospital and about ten minutes after I checked in it stopped LOL!!! She said it was probibly stress.|`|AA11459214	I had this too but only with my 2nd. I think it was because my uterus was expanding. It sounds pretty natural to me just rest and you should be fine in the morning. But if not you may want to call your doctor just in case.|`|ce437eacba23b245ed5c4ee833f7b13daa	Some stretching and cramping can be normal as uterus is stretching to a large size.  I know you don't want to hear it but the only way yo tell for sure if something is wrong is too see a doc.  If you experience any bleeding, or odd discharge go right away to an emergency facility.  If not you should be alright to wait and call your ob gyn to see whats going on.  You might not want to hear it but its importent for not only the babys health but yours as well.|`|TtTMh4xKaa	im 29weeks and i get the same thing... its just your uterus stretching .

My one year old eats apples with the skin pealed and sliced!|`|HIn1p4OBaa	yeah two year olds can eat apples but i wouldn't leave a rabbit with your babe. if it's just for a sec for fun and your watching, then sure that's ok. (i didn't watch the video by the way)|`|Pu4CSBWCaa	My daughter is 22 months old and eats apples all of the time  she grabbed one off the counter at about 19  months and started eating it, and has been doing so ever since  no, i would not put any animal in a crib with a 2 year old
SFBIgGT0aa	The bleeding is definitely not normal tell your doctor asap; and as for everything else, it seems pretty normal. Every pregnancy is different, body types and the way you eat have a lot to do with it.    PS. Congrats on your pregnancy. =]

AA11763588	Usually dizzy spells are due to dehydration. Try taking in more water through out the day to see if that helps.    As for feeling sick all day, that comes with the territory. Either try taking some B6 or ask your DR if they can perscribe you a pill called Zofran. It settles the stomach and helps with feeling sick all day.|`|hzlqCBWnaa	i was on prometrium with this pregnancy. ive had two other miscarriages. it worked out for me. ill be 19 wks tomm. it just made me feel sick and real tired. what your feeling is normal. if i may ask why did u lose your baby at 5 mts?
AEa7HHfmaa	I would absolutely go buy a pregnancy test. They are usually accurate anywhere after 5 weeks. You certainly have some of the symptoms. I am expecting right now and am 9 weeks, and my boobs are huge and were way bigger than usual by 6 weeks, but I'm sure that varies from person to person. I would not wait until Feb. to see if you miss, not only for the babies sake, but for you! Can you imagine being that stressed out and worried for another whole month?|`|p0prrzf2aa	maybe you were allergic to the condom. my mom is allergic to the latex in condoms so yea it's possible|`|n1D90COxaa	Chances are you probably are PG, you seem to have 99.9% of the symptoms.

I would definately say yes you could be.  O and I wasn't laughing at you I was laughing thinking of me and him.  We are horrible.|`|t0jC2o0Jaa	Certainly, it only takes ONE time and ONE sperm.

UXRwYHrMaa	They used to drug women out of their minds, but today I would say most doctors would be unwilling to put you to sleep. An epidural may also not be a great option for you because you have to sit very very still (even through a contraction) while they put the needle into a very specific spot on your back. If you are so terrified, you may find it difficult to stay still enough.    Your panic sounds serious enough that you need to have a real sincere discussion with your provider about your options.    There is something called a sterile water block which is a wonderful option because it is a drug free form of pain relief that works for about 90 minutes at a time.    You may also want to look into self hypnosis (or hypnosis with an expert's guidance). It is a very powerful tool for pain relief. Hypnobabies and hypnobirthing are both programs you can look into. Hypnosis is powerful enough that women with allergies to anesthesia can be hypnotized and go through major surgery like a csection. so it is certainly strong enough to help you through a totally natural process that your body was built to do!|`|cJfJd9yaaa	I don't think that the Ob will put you under general anesthetic unless it is absolutely necessary.  The baby also suffers the effects of the drug and will need to be ventilated after birth.  You need to calm down and remember that women have given birth billions of times successfully.  You will be fine.  You will have hospital staff with you, your birthing coach (b/f, husband, mother, best friend or whoever you have decided on) and they will be there to support you right throughout.    Epidural lowers the feeling of pain during contractions but you can still function such as moving your legs etc.  I spinal block will render you completely incapacitated from the waist down (ie: no feeling, no walking).  Both can be good but keep in mind that they can slow down labor.  You can also choose between many pain medications such as gas and other intravenous drugs.  The hospital staff will be able to advise you on these.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Why would you want to be asleep?? I'm attempting this one with no epidural,only other types of pain management...why wouldn't you want to welcome your baby?|`|dn2UCOkqaa	Why the hell would you want to be put to sleep!!?     I am having a natural birth no meds and I know I can do it .    A natural birth is a natural way to give birth,it's what we were meant to do. Getting drugs during child birth is taking the easy way out.    EDIT- Don't you want to be aware of bringing your child into the world and hold them and hear their first cry? I know I would!|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	Relax. Have an epidural. Remember that you'll be around trained medical professionals. You're not the first woman to be scared by L&D and you won't be the last.  :)|`|qHAgbuHkaa	How are you going to push a baby out if you're put out? That wouldn't work too well. What exactly are you so afraid of about giving birth? Both of my births were a breeze. I got an epidural with both (which is quick and honestly doesn't hurt that bad) and couldn't feel any contractions or pain and then 8-10 hours later, it was time to push. I pushed for 20 min with my first and about 5 with my second and they were out. Of course every labor is different, but most labors are smooth. With an epidural, you feel a quick poke and sting, very mild, that only lasts for a few seconds and it numbs the area. Then they put the epidural in and its over very quick and then you are pain free. I just slept, played board games, watched a movie and talked with my family and next thing I knew, I was fully dilated and ready to push. There must be a certain part of labor that's really scaring you, but you didn't add much detail. The only way you could possibly be put out for your birth is if you schedule a planned c-section and be put under general anesthesia for it, but I doubt a doctor will do that electively. Some doctors will let you choose to have a c-section, but most don't unless there's a medical reason, and I highly doubt they would let you be put under general anesthesia for it. I bet you're worrying about it way more than you need to. You'll probably realize you worried yourself over nothing. Worrying about it really won't solve anything. You know you have to give birth, and worrying won't help at all. And when you cry really hard and feel like you can't breath, you may be having a panic attack and although you probalby won't hurt your baby, panic attacks still aren't good for you. They make your heart race and they cause you to breath fast and that's going to affect the baby's oxygen if you're not breathing calmly. Serious complications with birth are rare. Ususally the worse case is needing a c-section and even then, c-sections are done so often and usually go very well. If you end up needing a c-section, they would probably let you be put out if you really wanted to. I think you will do just fine. You're probably freaking out over nothing.|`|gJDPrl6maa	i know what your going through. I freaked when they asked me if i wanted an epidural.. I am terrified of needles and the nurse was like what do you think an epidural is.. She was snotty about it. but the anesthesiologist came in rolled me on my side and i flipped!!! i started cry hysterically i couldnt breath and he Yelled at me IF YOU DO NOT STOP CRYING I WILL WALK OUT OF HERE AND I WILL NOT RETURN AND YOU WILL HAVE YOUR BABY IN PAIN!!! and i knew already that if it was gonna be another day i wasnt going through all them contracts again.Reminder i went through 58 hours of labor before the epidural.  So i sucked it up and i dont want to scare you but when your contractions get to a unbearable point you will want drugs.. BUt the needle for the epidural pinched and stung for a total of 10 seconds then i went numb from the hips down. It was the best feeling. the internal moniter is what i hated i felt it moving back and forth on the babys head. and it stung sooo bad..Birth was the best part i pushed for a total of 2 1/2 hours and the second i seen my sons head i got more determined to see my son. I pushed harder and i felt him come out it feels like a lil fish no lie. And he is already gonna be a year old feb 12 and i am SOOOO ready for my next one.     GL Hunni Its not as bad it sounds i promise .. I never use to believe what other people said about it being so easy and i was like yeah right blah blah blah but really Its not as bad as it sounds. You will do just fine!!    I dont think they will put you to sleep not even through a csection my sister was awake through all 3 of hers. I would go with the epidural cuz if the spinal block wears off in the middle of delivery your gonna be in pain.. and you only get one epidural one stick with a needle adn then the readdminister new bags of it through the same IV.|`|gd2FuS8haa	being put to sleep is very rare. the most they will do is give you is more numbing stuff for is you have a c-section, but I dont think there is anything else besides the Epidural and Spinal for the numbing. I mean they can give you drugs that will make you high :| I wont do that because I hate the high feeling. Im scared to deliver too. Im only 5 months pregnant, but still. My biggest worry is the epidural. I just want my son here lol :) but yeah besides the spinal and epidural, is natural. I get what you are saying about the panicing thing.. its called anixety lol. I get it a lot, specially when I start to think about getting the epidural! like I could drive myself crazy if I thought about it all day my anixety would shoot off the wall.    but the only other way I know is natural. and I hear thats VERY painful. I mean my aunt did it, and she said she would never do it again. But then agian I know people who have had it natural and said they will do it for the rest of their kids. So I guess it kind of depends on how well you handle pain. but that is all I know and have heard of :) good luck!|`|AA11762804	If you are that scared then I would talk to your doctor about a c-section  A spinal block may sometimes be called a "spinal." A narcotic or anesthetic, such as fetanyl, bupivacaine or lidocaine is injected below the spinal column directly into the spinal fluid and provides pain relief for up to 2 hours.      It is easy to confuse a spinal block and spinal epidural because they are both injections into the spinal area. For a spinal block, narcotics or anesthetic is injected once with a needle. For a spinal epidural or combined spinal epidural, a catheter is placed in the epidural space to allow continuous anesthesia. Spinal blocks are not widely administered today because of the popularity of epidurals, though they may be used in a more complex birth situation or cesarean delivery.     What you need to know about a spinal block  A spinal block may cause one or more of the following concerns:     Hypotension (low blood pressure)    Difficulty pushing during the second stage of labor   Severe headache requiring an epidural blood patch   Dizziness   Pruritus (itching)   In rare instances, convulsions   Both narcotics and caine medications cross the placenta and enter the babys blood stream   Baby may have trouble breastfeeding after birth     Epidural anesthesia is the most popular means for pain relief during labor. In fact, more women ask for an epidural by name than any other method of pain relief. Over 50% of women giving birth at hospitals use epidural anesthesia.    As you prepare yourself for labor day, learn as much as possible about pain relief options so you will be equipped and ready to make decisions throughout your birth experience. Understanding the different types of epidurals, how an epidural is administered, and the benefits and potential risks of an epidural will prepare you to make an informed decision for you and your baby as your birth unfolds.    What is epidural anesthesia?  Epidural anesthesia is regional anesthesia that blocks pain in a particular region of the body. The goal of an epidural is to provide analgesia, or pain relief, rather than complete anesthesia, which is total lack of feeling. Epidurals block the nerve impulses from the lower spinal segments resulting in decreased sensation in the lower half of the body. Epidural medications fall into a class of drugs called local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, chloroprocaine, or lidocaine. They are often delivered in combination with opioids or narcotics, such as fentanyl and sufentanil, to decrease the required dose of local anesthetic. This way pain relief is achieved with minimal effects. These medications may be used in combination with epinephrine, fentanyl, morphine, or clonidine to prolong the epidurals effect or stabilize the mothers blood pressure.    How is an epidural given?  Intravenous (IV) fluids will be started before active labor begins and prior to the procedure of placing the epidural. You can expect to receive 1-2 liters of IV fluids throughout labor and delivery. An anesthesiologist, a physician who specializes in anesthesia, an obstetrician, or nurse-anesthetist will administer your epidural. You will be asked to arch your back and remain still while lying on your left side or sitting up. This position is vital for preventing problems and increasing the epidural effectiveness. An antiseptic solution will be used to wipe the waistline area of your mid back to minimize the chance of infection. A small area on your back will be injected with a local anesthetic to numb it. Then a needle will be inserted into the numbed area that surrounds the spinal cord in the lower back. A small tube or catheter is threaded through the needle into the epidural space. The needle is carefully removed leaving the catheter in place so medication can be given through periodic injections or by continuous infusion.The catheter will be taped to your back to prevent it from slipping out.     What are the types of epidurals?  There are 2 basic epidurals used today. However, hospitals and anesthesiologists vary on the dosages and the combinations of medication they use. You will want to ask your care providers at the hospital about their protocol.  ? Regular Epidural: After the catheter is in place, a combination of narcotic and anesthesia is administered through either a pump or periodic injections into the epidural space. The narcotic, such as fentanyl or morphine, is given to replace some of the higher doses of anesthetic, such as bupivacaine, chloroprocaine, or lidocaine, which helps reduce some of the adverse effects of anesthesia. You will want to find out your hospitals policies about staying in bed and eating.  ? Combined Spinal-Epidural (CSE) or Walking Epidural: An initial dose of narcotic, anesthetic or a combination of the two, is injected beneath the outermost membrane covering the spinal cord, and inward of the epidural space. This is the intrathecal area. The anesthesiologist will pull the needle back into the epidur|`|9udgqiHwaa	its normal to be scared and nervous- i was too...  i was induced which does bring on stronger and faster contractions and i had horrible back labor! very painful but i did manage without an epidural (got stadol thru iv and a shot in the butt to take the edge off)  but i was only in labor for 6 hours...and i LOVED giving birth!  just relax- take one contraction at a time and remember to breathe! you will do fine :) maybe you will have a good experience like me1  good luck!|`|S3t69kh2aa	This is going to be the most exciting day of your life!  No, you don't want to sleep.  It's okay to be scared.  It's okay to ask for medication.  Do you have a coach?  You will make it through!  It might be easy, it might be hard, but it's okay.  After you have the baby in your arms you will wonder why you were worried.  Concentrate on the joy.  Every time you start to worry, think of something positive about the baby... baby clothes, decorating, toys... anything that makes you happy!  Make this a happy experience.  Life is so short.  You should be full of happy dreams for your baby and your family.|`|UA8hWoQKaa	OK LOOK I WAS JUST LIKE U! I PROMISE ITS NOT AS BAD OR AS HARD AS U THINK!

IFqY2w1Paa	It sounds like a common ache and pain of pregnancy to me. When I was 34 weeks along, my pelvic area was so painful. I was worried about it, so I went to L&D to make sure I wasn't in labor...and my cervix was still completely closed. It's the pressure of the baby on your muscles and pelvic bone. That bone is relaxing and getting a bit more elastic to prepare for birth, and some women find this more uncomfortable than others. For me, it's almost unbearable at times. =/ I hope it doesn't get that bad with you. Good luck!|`|F4rCjV1haa	That is very normal,just so there is no spotting with the pains.It just mean you pelvis is getting ready for delivery take a while for your body to get ready.So don't worry you are not in labor earthed  Good Luck.|`|HoonZJMgaa	no don't worry.He is most likely laying in a way that is uncomfortable to you on a nerve or something. This is very normal. Try laying on the side that hurts which may cause him to move enough to make the pain subside. Also rest with your feet up as much as possible because this can get worse as your pregnancy progresses. Good luck and enjoy the remainder of your pregnancy and on to motherhood!|`|xLNl0f14aa	i wouldnt worry they say those aches and pains are normal the farther along u get because u have a lot of stretching going on.. but if it bothers u to much talk to ur OB about physical therapy just to help out with the pains 8)

xGedX2rIaa	no because ovulation has already passed and therefore you can not get pregnant
SXS2Gf72aa	It's pregnant, not 'pregnate'.  And if you're worrying about it, the stress will mess your body up enough to make you late. So stop worrying about it.  And of course there's a chance you're pregnant if you had unprotected sex. Duh.|`|256cVXsmaa	Hey   First off it's pregnant*** Just thought you should no just incase you are and you have to start spelling it alot =D  About your question... Taking the pill and then missing a few days makes you even more fertile than normal so yes you possibly could be pregnant.  Don't freak yourself out though because than you will miss your next period due to stress.  I am sure the symptoms you are feeling are because you are just freaking yourself out because it is a little early to be experiencing any kind of symptom.  Just wait it out and take a test if you miss your period.    And next time don't have unprotected sex if you miss a pill!   Good luck though|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You could get pregnant from the unprotected sex because you may have ovulated BUT you would NOT be experiencing or feeling any pregnancy symptoms yet. It's physically impossible. Use protection every tim you have sex for the next few weeks and take a test to make sure you aren't pregnant. If you aren't go ahead and take your birth control again.|`|94kNwMPdaa	first of all its PREGNANT****  second of all. You could be just go take a test. But its probably because your pills got messed up.
n24githIaa	You can have sex with her. :)  The baby is protected with the amniotic fluid and the birthing sac, so sex is okay unless your wife is considered high risk.  Which is unusual.  Sex is actually soothing to the baby. :D  That's what my baby magazine told me.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	She's only 5 weeks so on the sex issue I would just back off and wait for her to come to you. Get reacquainted to your hand I guess. Sorry :) That's really all you can do. I'm 10 weeks and it took me a while to be in the mood again, but it DOES happen.     With the mood swings just try to remind yourself that is not YOU she's just on a roller coaster of emotions and it's hard to keep it together. It will get better. She loves you otherwise she wouldn't be married to you or be having your baby. I know it's hard but all you can really do is hang in there and be supportive. Next time she yells at you for nothing close your eyes and say "It's just the hormones. She loves me". Sounds stupid but...it's what my husband does. My hormones have been nuts too.     It gets better and just think, when this is all over you'll both get to share a baby THE BOTH OF YOU created! :)  Good luck!|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	It's kindof hard to understand your post, but from what I gathered, it frankly sounds like there is a bigger issue than just hormones. Yes, it's true that pregnancy hormones can heighten your emotions, but they don't make you like that. I would talk to her and find out what is really going on. It sounds like some underlying problems need to be fixed, and then maybe the sex will return (or maybe not. Many women aren't that interested in it during pregnancy)|`|6avKnzkoaa	I suggest you read the book - What to expect when she's expecting - it'll tell you what you might expect from your partner and it contains a lot of humour in it. And I believe it's written by a man aswell. The father of my child read that book and enjoyed it. Much less information and more just experiences. =]|`|NiOjHyfKaa	i can barely understand what you wrote.........|`|94kNwMPdaa	all you can do is just be there for her.|`|u3xzrJszaa	Don't mind it too much. It's very stressful, and as a pregnant mother, you have alot of unlet out anger, so take it calmly. She 99.9% doesn't mean any of it. Just wait for a while, it's just hormones. If she doesn't calm down a bit, try talking to her(calmly, over dinner)|`|euX2DbVAaa	the mood swings are normal... just agree with what she has to say. thats what my boyfriend does. i yell at him and take all my stress out on him and he copes with it (imhaving twins and im stressed out alooott!!). All he does is say "ok" until im back to normal agian. Just wait for her to come to you about the sex. im 14 weeks pregnant and my sex drive is high.|`|SnyDa8Claa	At 5 weeks, not even the "boy" knows it's a boy.     and wow..that's moody.  I would wait until she is in her 2nd trimester before buying anything.    I never ha emotions like that...is she normally a bit like that? and why do you have to coax her, if you are the one holding out?
AQn5sTXraa	I won't question or judge you, so here is an interesting link:    http://stargatelibraries.com/TipsToInduc...    But please think of why you feel so strongly that you need to do this. Take care.|`|Fbxiwvohaa	Technically you can make yourself start lactating again.  Some adoptive mothers do and believe it or not some fathers have made themselves lactate as well.      The key is to buy a good electric breast pump.  You would need to do it many times a day -- say every 2-4 hours.  It will take a while, but eventually it should work.      I know you said you don't want to use medicine, but there is a herb called fenugreek that you can buy at GNC in pill form that will increase the production of breast milk.  I used it to increase mine till we found out my daughter was allergic to milk.|`|zwctZ812aa	That isn't going to be possible unless you have a baby to put to your breast.|`|MzHwklzKaa	Lactation as a hobby?    OK, what ever floats your boat!    You need the right hormones.  You can "force" your system to lactate, but you need drugs to do it.  The kind of drugs only doctors hand out.    Good luck.|`|6cN8aLnaaa	I don't think that it's possible to lactate unless your body produces that certain hormone. I'm pretty sure you would have to take some kind of med or get pregnant again to lactate.
AA10003191	Sorry, but no.    Did you tell the X-ray tech you might be pregnant? Every department I've seen always asks women who might even be CLOSE to childbearing age.    Did they shield you in any way?  In any case, mammograms are very directed/focused x-rays.
f6qbRAmvaa	keep it things will change if not there is always adoption!!!|`|IvMPh09baa	Hmm... well you are thinking about the wrong person right now, its the baby that is important and the potential life you will have to prepare the baby for.  Obviously from your question you are very unprepared financially, emotionally, and relationship wise you don't seem that you are with someoen that can provide a lot of support at the moment.  So to break it down simply to help your decision making here are your choices:  1. raise a baby under poor conditions, no father or a distant father, unmarried parents.    b. abort, focus on your life, your finances and work at your relationship until you get to a point that you know you are prepared to raise a child... meaning you are married or living together and can depend on the other person to provide financially and emotionally to raise a child.    Your choice, but sounds to me like you are very unprepared for a child at this point... but it depends on what you really want in life... and once a baby enters the world, it is and always will be what is best for the child, not you anymore... so if you say yes to keeping the baby, you need to decide what you have to do that would be best for the baby and not you or him... for the child though.  if you are not prepared to do that, then I say abort and focus on yourself.  You are still young and have plenty of time for a child... theres no rush.    As for all the people telling you not to abort, don't listen to them completely... they are not and will not be the ones raising your child, you will be... so do what is best for you and what you feel you are able to handle.  If you cannot handle this right now then don't do it...|`|XRLbqtUbaa	On reading about your situation alone...u seem to have become attached to the possibility of having a baby (broke your heart when he said abortion), so I honestly think it would hurt u by going that route (u would end up with lots of regrets)...and that's something he needs to know.    U are NOT and will NOT ruin his life.  U both decided to have sex, so you both were aware of the possibility of becoming pregnant I'm sure.    You have to just take a deep breath and tell him what u want.  You know what u don't want to do and he needs to be aware of how u feel.|`|Spm9Raz9aa	i wouldnt reccomend an abortion. if your situation prevents you from raising a baby right now, then i could strongly suggest carrying the baby full term and thinking seriously about adopion.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I think you need to talk to a counselor to make such a huge decision. You don't want to rush into something and later regret the decison. It is better to spend $70 and talk to someone and are sure of what you want to do.     Good Luck with what you decide.|`|1aedb3e2dfe276d9756f4cf4095308efaa	This is your child.  No matter how much debt you have, you can support your child.  There are numerous places that can help you.  Also, babies really don't need most of the stuff that Babie R Us would lead you to believe!  Mom to Mom sales are a great way to get a bargain price on necessities.  Think about how you feel.  You sound as if you want this baby.  If that's the case, have your baby!  You state that you know he will possibly come to regret/resent you because of the baby, but how will you feel yourself down the road when you think of what might have been?  This is a big decision, but ultimately, you need to decide what's right for you and your baby...Not what's right for your boyfriend.  Good luck to you.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Keep your baby could be the next prime minister.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	In that whole long thing, you don't offer one single legit reason to terminate the pregnancy.  Not even a simple "I don't want to have a child and I feel like an abortion is the best option for me".  Sure, your situation may make things difficult and challenging, but it doesn't seem like its impossible.  You never once said that you actually want an abortion, just that your boyfriend suggested it.  What do YOU want to do?    You are an adult with a career that made decisions that lead to a pregnancy.  It is your responsibility and yours alone to figure out what is best for you.  Debt can be managed (contact a counselor or consider bankruptcy).  If you are only 6 weeks pregnant, you have plenty of time to apply for jobs and find something closer to your boyfriend if that's what you want.  No potential employer would even know that you are pregnant and you aren't obligated to tell them.  So there's the solution to those two problems.  Now, back to the main issue.  You're pregnant and you have three options.  Deep in your heart and soul, which one do you feel is best for YOU?|`|4dXcZhuTaa	You need to sit down and tell him everything you just told us.    He needs to know how worried you are and that it's scary for you, but you think having the baby is what's best for you.    In the end it has everything to do with what is best for you.|`|PlnO0bHXaa	Do not get an abortion! It is legalised murder!!! If anything, give the baby up for adoption!! Its better than killing an innocent child!    Why punish the child for the parents fault?  Many sterile women would love to adopt the baby!     Please don't get an abortion!!|`|L7uz5Xmzaa	Abortion is a cop out. If he (or you for that matter) were not ready than why not use protection. and his whole 'you forceed him into this situation' thing sounds like someone who doesn't want to commit. He is trying to blame you for something that takes TWO people. And besides, if you two don't stay together you can gat a patunity test in 8 1/2 moths (after the baby is born) and if he is the father he HAS to pay child support. Anyway, Good luck, and follow your heart.|`|QJDbG1F1aa	First and foremost, that child didn't put itself in that situation of being conceived. If any man truly loves you and wants you to be the mother of his child, debt won't matter. He'd want you to have the baby and come up with a plan so you guys would have a fair advantage. If you ask me, I'd say keep the child. Just work harder.|`|9490cc31e63b3e2949a248e69bacf006aa	will I hate to say this but it is your decision and every one has a story but if you dont want it do what you think is best not for him but for the baby remember the baby cant speak yet so think of his or hers feelings before your dudes baby is first now not him. If you want the baby go for it. I had doubts to at first I wanted a abortion but than I thought it's not fair to my little man and now am excitied to have him to know how beautiful he will be and how small he will be some one to love you and look up to you its the best feeling any mom could have. it's a gift from God dont take that precious life away because how your man feels what if your mom did that to you. Really think about it Good luck.|`|hQppQFILaa	First of all, here might have been the wrong place to ask about abortion, you will get ALOT of answers saying that it is wrong.  Me being a mother, I personally could never do it.  I've heard horrible things about how it's done.  From the moment they are conceived, it is a person.  But that is up to you, lots of people have children, even when they aren't financially secure, my bf and I were no where near financial stability, he has huge school loans.  But we are ok, and everyday I look at my daughter and realize she is the most important thing that's ever happened to me.      Now as far as the father is concerned, I'm partial to this because my dad was leaning more towards abortion, and if that had happened, I wouldn't be here.  It is your decision as a woman, and you are now, technically a mother.  After I was born, I was my father's everything.  So, maybe he's scared.  IDK, ultimately it is your decision.  Make it for you.  Are you ready to raise a child?  It is hard, but worth it.....    Hope this helps a little bit, and God bless....|`|wWGNvMIQaa	You should NOT get an abortion! This may sound straight forward, but you made the decision to have sex with him unprotected or not, and hopefully know sex =baby. It was your choice and now you have a LIFE inside you are resposible for. There are plenty of options besides abortion. There are so many families out there who are struggling to have children and would love to help give your baby a loving home. Some may even offer to pay for medical bills. I am 37 weeks pregnant and even though you may not be able to feel it now, that is a living baby, relying on you for everything. Face your consequences, carry that child. If you decide to keep the baby it will be a blessing in your life, if not in your life, then someone who has been hoping and praying for a child a long time. If you have an abortion, you will regret it everday. Everyday you will wonder what could have been and if you made the right decision to eliminate a life. I know women who have made that decision and that is exactly how they feel. Do not deny a child breath because of selfish reasons. Good luck, and I hope you look into more then just abortion as an option.|`|44uorNhOaa	keep the baby!!!|`|AA11762804	Either keep the baby or give it up for adoption, if you wanted to keep the baby but your b/f wants you to have an abortion and you are willing to go with that instead of giving your baby a chance and give a family a child who would normally not be able to have kids then i dont think you should be a mother. im sorry if i come across as mean but im not trying to be, go for an open adoption that way you can be in the child's life and you wouldn't be "ruining" you b/f life even though it would not.    your an adult dont be childish and go get an abortion because you were not ready, because if your not ready to be a mom then your not ready to have sex, no matter how old you are. Be an adult either keep your baby or give him/her up for adoption|`|fIUr49ujaa	Sweetie please don't have an abortion.  It is so cruel how they do it.  Look on You Tube and type in abortion.  You will see that is the most cruel thing.  Raising a baby isn't easy but a lot of women do it by themselves.  Debt yes is a complication but you can do it.  The state can help with that.  Please don't murder that poor baby.  Everything happens for a reason.  God doesn't make mistakes.  If he leaves you because of the baby then he truely didn't love you.  You can do it or God wouldn't have given you this miracle.  Or you can give it up for adoption.  Just please not abortion.|`|mLbydsVIaa	o wow im so srry :(  but dont worry things will work out....he may be leaning more against abortion now but when he sees your tummy grow and sees the first ultrasound,hears the HB,&feels the first kicks he will feel differently....you have almost 10 months to find a way for yall to be closer and for things to fall into place...please keep the baby..i know you wont regret it.  it may seem hard to think about but it WILL work out...there will be ppl there for yall and you will have help...its not gonna be as bad as you think.  just tell him "baby i wanna keep the baby..i just cant find it in my heart to kill it..i know it will be hard but it will be worth it and will be something we can get through together."  im sure he will be there for you and still support your decision. who knows.. he might even change his mind and be more positive since you are being more positive...he'll be more likley to be as positive as you if your not being negative and tlk positivly.  good luck with everything,god bless, hope this helps and you keep the baby!!  :)|`|MhEM5yq8aa	ok ya bf is a jerk i wish my bf would look up abortions **** that lol. but follow your heart to me abortions are wrong so i think you should place it for adoption or KEEP THE BABY!!!!!!!!!!! i had an abortion last year and it still hurts my soul to know i kilt my baby but i'm prego again and i amkeepin this one i refuse to me make the same mistake twice.
QJDbG1F1aa	No, call him and ask him. Make sure you know the last day of you menstraul. Another way to find out is to use a pregnancy due date predictor. There are plenty free ones online.|`|6avKnzkoaa	Normally, they'll do a more detailed ultrasound at 13 weeks to reconfirm your EDD. EDD are like they are, estimations. I'm sure your baby is fine.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	No i wouldnt think so.    When was your last period - work it out from that.    He may have thought you already knew so didnt mention it|`|W4CQkNj8aa	first of all ther e is no reason to worry . no one can tell you exact date of delivery not even doctor.usualy delivery date is very close to date given by doctor

She needs to take test when her period is late not before her period is due if she wants accurate results. She should test now to get an accurate result! And if not then She may want to see her doctor to see why she isnt getting her period|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Three weeks is a long time to be late. There's still a possibility she could be pregnant. Have her test again, it could have been too soon for the first two tests. If she is pregnant, the test should be able to tell her. If there's any doubt, tell her to go to the doctor to be sure, or to find out what's wrong.  Good luck!|`|s3WdcVknaa	ohh boy ya deffinatly|`|tIaJOXJiaa	Congrats!|`|OfxSeKSzaa	she could very well be pregnant it take about 3 weeks to actually conceive.  Even though they say a woman is pregnant for 9 months its really 10 months.  Because they do not count the first 3 weeks, it sounds like she is pregnant, best thing to do is to take another test about 1 week after her missed period. Even if she does start, and it's not normal, she needs to wait about a week and test. If she spots a pink, that's implantation, and thats when doctors start counting the months.  I wsh you  both the best either way..|`|AA11764685	http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...

PLbmKNpvaa	Unfortunately it sounds like the maths might be off, doctors are almost never that far out because all they're doing is calculating from the last date of the woman's last period. Did he determine this by an ultrasound? Because if that's the case it could be that the baby hasn't grown much at all for a few weeks... But then the doctor would have said something about that as no growth for 3 weeks is a bad sign.  Ask her when the last day of her last period was and use a website date of conception calculator. That will give you the right date of conception regardless of the baby's growth rates and let you know whether or not it's likely that you're the father. Good luck.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	I Don't think they can be off by that long. I would get a paternity test if I were you...    I was worried that my child would be with another man but in the end my estimate was right. *Thank god!* I had my due date nailed down to the day and everything! May 8th :)|`|AA11820380	Doctors don't go by date of conception because it is impossible to find out when the baby was conceived, you may have had had sex that day, but it doesn't mean that that's when it was conceived. They go by the first day of our last period.     Edit: my due date is also off going by the ultrasound. I only had sex, on the 26th and 27th of sept. and the ultrasound said that my baby was concieved 5 days prior to that. You'll have a little more ease when she get's an ultrasound. If the dates are off by a week, no worries. Like i said, mine is off by 5 days.    Edit again: With my first son, they were in fact off by 3 weeks. My first due date was March 27th(going by last period), when they did the ultrasound I was really further along by a little over 3 weeks so they changed it to March 2nd, so I don't know what these other women are talking about, so YES it is possible for them to be off, unless it was an ultrasound.|`|AA11348933	Ultrasounds that are done earlier (In the first trimester) are more accurate for dating than ones that are done further along in pregnancy.  The further along she gets the less accurate the ultrasound.  At 22 weeks they're less accurate for dating.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Are you taking into account the fact that doctors include the two weeks of her cycle before she even ovulates when they estimate how far along she is?  If not, then conception would have been two weeks later than you're estimating.      But in answer to your question, yes, doctors can make these mistakes, it's not all that unusual.  Yet, at the same time, they could very easily be right, and this baby may not be yours.  I hope it's just what I said earlier and that you just hadn't subrtacted those two weeks and the baby is yours.|`|GAMypxIFaa	They will go by here last period, so if her period was in the middle of August then they will count that as the first day she got pregnant when really she didn't actually conceive until about two weeks after that, if she had regular periods that is.   Have you had an ultrasound?      Did she know her exact day of her last period?    I am due in three weeks and by my last period i am due the 18 of Feb, by the ultrasound i am due the 24.    The doctors can tell by ultrasound and size of her belly measurements, sorry to say but i think it probably isn't yours. It would be hard to say yes it is yours because three weeks can be detected i would think!    I have switched doctors three times and they all came out with the same due date and she measures regular so i would say ask her when her first day of her VERY last period was and calculate it yourself, and ask when she had sex with the other guy, and what her period was in July!!  GOOD LUCK HONEY!!!!!! I hope you get what you want!
ce437eacba23b245ed5c4ee833f7b13daa	Stress is normal during pregnancy , no way to remove it completely.  Take him to the doctors appointments with you so he know whats going on and that everything is ok.  Also he can ask any questions he wants to the doc as well.  Talk about the finances you will need and start to figure out budgeting and how you will cope with the increased costs.  Men stress about money a lot.  Mostly just talk to each other but try not to force him to open up if he doesn't feel comfortable with it.|`|AA11920812	LMAO    Uh, if you find the answer please email it to me!    My husband was the BIGGEST freak the whole nine months. I was the one comforting and reassuring him. It felt so backwards to me and to be honest I was very fearful of the day we brough the baby home. He even said to me one night, *You know if he doesn`t let me sleep at night I`m going to have to sleep in the guest room* :(((    I must say my husband turned out to be the best father ever. He got up in the middle of the night with him and paced the floors. He held him close and just paced. I was amazed. He`d see me tired and dazed and say here, let me take him. And he would. My mom couldn`t get him to quit crying when we were eating dinner after we first came home. Anbu said, here let me. And got up from his own dinner and paced/rocked him to sleep.    Nothing to worry about. He`s nervous and just not sure of what the future holds. Just support him and reassure him you`ll be there with him...whatever that future is!!    Good Luck! And enjoy your baby!!|`|NxNrZksXaa	take him with you to the doctor and to classes that you may go to so he can experience everything and see how things work and what to expect and etc. also maybe taking new parenting class will probably help.|`|mWZE7gF7aa	The question should be 'How does your boyfriend keep you stress free during the pregnancy!'
UXRwYHrMaa	It is possible, and everyone on here will be quick to tell you that if you have unprotected sex it is *always* possible. But truthfully it is probably unlikely. If you knew when you have ovulated for certain (because you were tracking it) then you could not get pregnant 2 days before your period was supposed to start.    But the problem is that even if you think you have very regular (albeit short) cycles, every woman's cycle is sensitive to changes in the environment, travel, diet, exercise, even friendship groups, that can make one cycle much longer than usual. Cycles are longer because ovulation gets delayed. So even if you think you normally have a 21 day cycle, on this particular cycle you could go as long as 32 days. And since we'll have to guess at your luteal phase, I'll guess you have about a 9 or 10 day luteal phase, which is about as short as possible in the normal distribution. So in this hypothetical cycle where it was going to go long and was going to be a 32 day cycle, you would ovulate on day 22. So yes, you could be pregnant. Essentially, if your cycle were delayed by 6 days or so this time around, it would mean you would have actually had sex right around the time when you were ovulating and maximally likely to conceive.    But I dont say that to scare you. It means it is possible. It does not mean it is likely. Most women whose cycles vary have them vary by about four days on either side of the average. So when I was tracking mine, I averaged 31 days, with the longest 35 and the shortest 28.|`|i8Ch743Laa	You wouldn't know anything this early on.|`|oyvRHQmaaa	More likely stressed from worrying about it.....|`|R65Owmebaa	you wont know until 1 wk before your next period ...when its a week before your next period take a pregnancy test.|`|bgDMY8I2aa	If you have sex then you could be pregnant.|`|bPRUViFXaa	you could, but you need to chill out, stress can prevent you from your period so dont think about so much. if you think you are, then in a week go buy a test, but untill then dont worry because it only causes your period to be late....    trust me i know, i did like the same thing before...    i know its hard not to think about it, but youll be fine...|`|DI4a42xoaa	there is a possibility you are. spotting is the first sign of pregnancy|`|H0GVH863aa	It's very possible.  Buy a test!|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Yes, you could be. It could also be something else. The only way to know is to take a test when your next period is due.
1z3C0R2Vaa	normal...|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I had the "blue vein" syndrome during all of my 6 pregnancies. You honestly could see every vein in my body without even trying! My last is 3 months old and you can still see all my veins! It is possible that you could be pregnant but take a HPT or wait until your drs. visit.
8CPH9l0vaa	My sister actually had this same problem, and it turns out that her body was rejecting it. She called the doctor's office and left a message with the nurse, who spoke with the doctor. The nurse called her back and told her she needed to come in, so she did and they ended up having to remove it. I don't know how severe your pains are, but it may be a good idea to call your doctors office as well and just ask.|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	It can be, I get them from time to time..I've had mine for 10mths. Try to atleast get through the first three mths..they say after that most side effects stop. I still have alot of (possible) side effects but still not ready to get mine out because it cost almost $600! I would be pissed if I did get it removed..and all those "side effects" didn't go away. Try to stick it out if you can to see!|`|I2e4LFF9aa	I have mirena too. for 6 months now and HATE IT! yea its 900. but still. You most likely had insurance so you wont be out alot of money. just use heating pads and warm baths.
Coc593Ikaa	No, it doesn't have to mean anything. How long are you cycles on average? For all we know, you are still early for your period. Also, sometimes they are just late or they skip altogether.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	well it means your period is late which is a sign of pregnancy, the only symptom of pregnancy for sure is a positive pregnancy test.|`|4GnzqUxzaa	Depends on how long your cycle is.   when was your period due?
rWeLFd2daa	I beleive it will be not as aesy to get pregnant and that your chances are not that high but if you just keep hope it should happen good luck i wish you the best you can email me if you ever need to talk : )|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	what ??? speak english and make sense|`|KGrMMAOaaa	well have you talked to your doctor? im sure they can run some tests and help you out|`|wK5k435Waa	I don't know. you tell me.

rMNWd17saa	My first child was born March 24th! (she'll be 23 this year)  I have 6 children and the ultrasounds were always off.  My doctor said that baby could be a whole pound more or less than what the ultrasound says.  So your baby could be between 4 to 6 pounds.  I wouldn't worry about it, even the 3d isn't 100% accurate.  Wait and see what Doctor says.  Besides she still has 8 more weeks for baby to grow.  As long as Mom is eating healthy baby can put on a lot of weight between now and baby's birthday.    With my last baby u/s said she would be 7 1/2 pounds.  She was an even 9 pounder and 2 weeks early!!!    Good luck and congrats!!!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	late ultra sounds are not a good way to tell your due date, they are known to be out by plus or minus 4 weeks, the only time an ultra sound is really accurate is for dating a pregnancy is when it is done between 6 and 8 weeks.|`|R65Owmebaa	I wouldn't worry to much mention it to your doctor tomorrow...Don't worry about things you cant change or do anything about...I know its hard with a new baby on the way...But your doc. will know best just voice your concern and worry to him|`|S3t69kh2aa	If you know your conception date, you know your due date.  Talk to your doctor if you are worried.  The person that told you your due date was at the end of April made a mistake.  So, don't worry about what he/she said.  The best thing your wife can do for herself is to eat well.  Some babies are big and some are small.  Big does not equal better.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    The best things to avoid to increase chances of falling pregnant are  -Caffeine  -Alcohol  -Smoking    You need to eat healthy diets, having regular sex every other day keeps the sperm healthy and a high count.  Hope this information helps  xx|`|nCrbKAuzaa	there is only one thing that could help avoiding pregnancy and that is..    stop doing premarital sex or having sex..    that is the best solution that i could give you..|`|bVVOHpweaa	Is this a trick question?
GWveqx61aa	idk what the mini pill is, but maybe this messed up your period, or stress or maybe you didnt ovulate, it sounds to me like you didnt, id wait another week than go see the dr if you have no results by then,_good luck and baby dust to us all_
96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	They would be 19 weeks, 4 days along gestational age, last menstrual period age would be around 21 weeks depending on her cycle. (4.5-5 months along) Two months ago would have been in December. So unless this person had sex after that date, it's impossible they would be two months along now in late February. So it's obvious she's lying if she only had sex in October.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	I found out october 15 that I was pregnant, my last period was September 11.  I am 24 weeks now which equals 6 months.  She can't be only 2 and a half months.|`|k7xC3jleaa	BULL CRAP.

I think she's full of ****.|`|yrF1q1mdaa	that's about 2 weeks before me so i would say about 19-20 weeks|`|AA10148408	It sounds like 4 months minimum to this present day, however, the first stage of ovulation ranges from 7-40 days for some women.  Pregnancy does not happen until the second stage of ovulation.  I would verify by a pregnancy test, then go with her to a OB-GYN doctor for an accurate determination.|`|8690df0b85ec35592f844389d7875bceaa	She is just over 4 months pregnant and if she maintains that conception date was Oct 12, baby is due early to mid July.  Gestation period is 40 weeks from last period.|`|lnk5Sh7Kaa	Sounds like she's full of ****, otherwise she would know exactly how far along she is. I conceived on December 4th and i'm 14 weeks pregnant.

(a lazy way to say Hanibal Lector) <br>  and she totally misspelled her daughters name on her birth certificate... <br>  <br>  <br>  So the moral is... when asking people for baby name advice...

I'd cally your healthcare provider and let them know, often the plug coming away doesn't mean that you'll go into labour soon but if you're having complications then they'll probably want to know so that they can monitor you.<br>  Good luck :)|`|MdgLHHd3aa	Yeah, that sounds like your mucous plug... it's like a clump and it's bloody.<br>  <br>  I had quite a bit, hard to describe but it was like snot and neverending|`|F4rCjV1haa	If you are having problem with your placenta I think you should give your doctor a call.Just to be on the safe side Good Luck with everything.|`|52U22fiAaa	Mine was every time I wiped for about a day before I had my little girl!

oE77lovwaa	Who cares if we think you're weird?<br>  <br>  It's the people at your school that matter, and trust me if you're in high school yet there's tons of weird kids that find friends. Join afterschool clubs that you like like art club, car club, medical clubs, book club, student council, etc. and if you join a club with your interests...chances are those people in there are going to share the same similarities in personality as you.<br>  <br>  It just takes conversation, friendliness, and a smile to make a friend. Talk to someone new in your class. If you're assigned to group projects in class don't be afraid to speak up and talk to those you usually wouldn't. <br>  <br>  Talking to people isn't that hard to do, and talking to people does wonder. They learn who you really are and in time you'll make lots of new friends.|`|p6o8c1GWaa	Join a club like cheerleading!|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well your not weird is the way you are but if they dont except the way you are then there not you reall friends but try to be more open dont be shy or anything like that|`|FdntqYoTaa	well you have to find people that you get along with and have simialr interests that's how i make friends|`|T4gMdDXaaa	The only friend you need is Jesus.
XmJZkFuMaa	Legally, she must be in a rear-facing carseat until she is 20lbs and 1 year old.  For instance, my daughter is a year old and is 18 lbs, so she can't face forward yet.  Another friend's son is 21lbs and 9 months old.  He can't face forward yet.  You have to wait for both of them.  It's not the law in EVERY state, but it's the safety recommendation and it's the law in a lot of the states in America.  So better safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  However, she can be in a carseat you can take out and carry with you.  Usually those last to 22lbs, then you get a forward facing one.  <br>  <br>  The longer you can have them rearface though, the safer it is.  My daughter's seat goes to 33lbs rear-facing, so she'll be facing back probably until she's 2 years old or more even.  If there is a collision, it's safer for their heads that way.|`|EeGgovyCaa	You can't switch them till they are 1 year and 20 lbs, but they don't NEED to be facing forward at that point.
2pxiK9waaa	She cannot legally face forward until 1 year AND 20 lbs, NOT or. You're going to need to buy a convertible car seat that stays in the car and facing rear until she's either 33 or 35 lbs. It's always safest rear facing. I'd recommend the Britax Marathon. It's a wonderful seat and it will last her until she's 65 lbs.|`|Jswomud7aa	When she weighs at least 22 lbs and 12 months old. <br>  <br>  So she has quite a ways to go...<br>  <br>  Even if your baby's legs are touching the seat back, or the baby cries when rear-facing, you should still keep baby rear-facing to at least one year and 22 pounds. Both requirements must be met before turning baby around. An 18-pound 14-month-old baby should rear-face because her body is not big enough to tolerate crash forces in a forward-facing car seat. Likewise, a 25-pound 10-month-old should remain rear-facing because his neck is not sufficiently developed to handle the crash forces while in a forward-facing car seat. <br>  <br>  A forward-facing car seat is considered safe after one year AND 20 pounds, but a rear-facing car seat is safer. According to NHTSA, a rear-facing car seat is 71 percent safer than no restraint at all, and a forward-facing car seat is 54 percent safer than no restraint at all. Keeping your baby rear-facing to the limit of the seat is the safest choice. You can check your car seat instruction book or the labels on the car seat sides to find the rear-facing weight and height limits.|`|Cah6nfV5aa	She needs to be rear facing until she is at least 1 and 20 lbs. You can buy a convertible car seat that rear faces and put her in it whenever you want, she doesn't have to be in the carrying car seat. The longer she faces the rear the safer she is. I used the Britax Marathon from when my daughter was 10 months old and am still using it. She is currently 17 months.|`|TXddP0uxaa	Check your manufacturers instructions for specific details on your model, but in general, infant carriers rate up to 20 to 22 pounds.  After that, she'll need a new seat.  If she is under age one, she still needs to face backwards.  Find a "convertible seat"  it will go from backward to forward facing.  The current safety standard is to keep the baby backward facing as long as they can fit that way because it is safer, but NEVER face them forward before age 1.

8jlOGOAeaa	I would make a doctor appointment! He could have stuck something up his nose and it could be rotting. My mother works at an elementary school and this little girl had a wierd smell coming from her nose as well. The nurse eventually checked and she had a rotting piece of sponge stuck up there. Kids can be very gross sometimes.|`|zQ7GE9k4aa	mabye the milk he's drinking?|`|kVY9061Vaa	hey, if you are brushing his teeth twice a day, then it could be gastro problems like reflux etc.. my little sister gets it quite bad and omg her breath reeks sometimes!! just take him to the doctors and ask if he can do a test, it's not an invasive test, to find out what's causing it :)|`|a7730a9cde4a08743d264b0b8c3af4b4aa	i would take him to the doc and get him checked he may have stuck something up there or sneezed when he was eating and some got in to his sinus's. it can happen lots.|`|a1cac6a6e70b595d8e55cc64d4d1d264aa	Try brushing his teeth more often. Or at least use a wet washcloth and rub them clean. I know alot of little kids fight teeth brushing. Sour milk smelling? If that doesn't help see a doctor, could be a sign of something internally going on.|`|z7f3QHtfaa	what are you feeding him? some foods cause odors in children that don't have the same affect on us|`|0Kv360TEaa	Is it possible he stuck something up his nose, like a pea or something? that would account for the smell and the trouble breathing.  I would say make a dr.'s appointment!

La facil es que se te aparezca un arcangelito llamado Gabriel, y te diga que el Se?or te ha elegido para llevar a su hijo en vientre. Y si, esa es la facil.    Ahora, la dificil, que si en algun momento hay semen sobre tu (virgen) vagina, osea que tenga el himen intacto y todo, por casualidad de drenado intermolecular (ahi ya vamos 1 de 500 millones de posibilidades) y llega una cantidad de semen adentro de tu vagina, supera todas las protecciones naturales, y llega a tu ovulo, te embarazas, por lo cual va otra posibilidad de enrte 450 millones (por que en una eyaculacion normal 1 de 450 millones de espermatozoides llegan al ovulo, y eso, con suerte), osea multiplicandolo, las posibilidades para eso son de: 1 entre 225'000'000'000 de posibilidades.

73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	If you are taking your birth control pills regularly as you say, then your chance is slim to none.  Anyone who gets pregnant while on the pill has missed a pill or takes it at different times (morning one day, evening the next, etc.)   The low-dose pills these days NEED to be taken at the same time of day for the most effectiveness.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	it is very possible. Very low chance. but it can definitely happen.<br>  <br>  God bless x|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I concieved while on BC - im now 31weeks pregnant. I was taking the pill regularly, and never missed any.<br>  <br>  Pre *** can get you pregnant - and as the pill is not 100% there is always a chance|`|mbvpWNMeaa	It would be a miracle to get pregnant from this if you really haven't missed any of your pills.|`|52U22fiAaa	Not likely... BC alone works 99% of the time, whether he pulls out or not.  Of course, nothing is 100% but you should be OK.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Slim to none if you take your pills correctly.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Very very slim.  When I was on birth control, we didn't use the pull out method or condoms, and I never got pregnant.  Not that everyone should do that.  So I would say it would be very surprising if you got pregnant.|`|Y27SeLvxaa	Pre *** (as you call it) is actually more potent than any of it I've always heard.  But with you being on the pill I would think your chances are very slim.  Then again, everybody is different!|`|RjdrO7DVaa	I'm with Ava on this one except i used to forget some pills .. i dont think you have anything to worry about.
plI0WOrUaa	Before i was supposed to get my period, they started out hurting like they normally would before myperiod.  Then day by day, they hurt more.  they got really heavy and much bigger actually probably just from bloating.  The nipples not so much until around 8 weeks, and that was when the breast pain went away, and just the nipples were tender.  Hope that helps.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Nothing. My breasts stayed the same my entire pregnancy, they didn't hurt, then didn't grow, nothing. <br>  They didn't grow any until my milk came in.|`|bZNJU6ywaa	My breasts started feeling sore around the second or third month of my pregnancy- sore like when you're gonna get your period... After a few months this went away, and my nipples became more tender. Try warm showers- let the water run down and try to relax... Massage your breasts (and tummy!) often with cocoa butter to prevent stretch marks!! I used cocoa butter two to three times a day starting at 2 months and I have absolutely no stretch marks! Are you planning on breastfeeding? If so, your breasts/nipples will be sensitive and may hurt for the first month or so. All of this is normal- Good luck with your pregnancy! =)

8d53803d1b46d8c7299484bf8a83afd1aa	Get this program Taking Charge of Your Fertility.  There is a book and a software program.  In the program you can pick your baby's birthday then it will tell you what cycle and time during this cycle you should have sex in order for you baby to have a birthday around the one you chose (actual birthday depends on various things including your cycle).  It's pretty cool actually.  You can try the program free for 15-days on the website.  I liked it so much I bought it.      However, for this to work properly you will need to keep track of you temperature every morning for a few months until it determines which day you typically ovulate.  It also helps if you keep track of your cervical mucus.    Or I guess you could roughly figure it out manually, average pregnancy last 36-42 weeks.|`|1ffc303db15fdc00d04d05f7b03f2f53aa	If you conceive this month, you would have an August baby.

The latest you would want to get pregnant would be November for an August baby.  I would suggest going off the pill a few months before trying to get pregnant.  It's not absolutely necessary but I have known quite a few women, including my wife, who have taken 3-6 months to get back on a normal cycle again.  Just make sure you use protection for those first few months unless you are ok getting pregnant earlier than expected or planned.|`|24281513444449bb7f91cb6e5c237d38aa	Hello, Kristen.  I want to share with you my past week.  My husband and I just conceived our first child.  Two days after we found out I was pregnant, we lost that baby.  Every baby is a blessing.  You will never know whether or not you will be able to recieve that blessing until that baby is in your arms.  Risking the loss of time (even a few months) just to time your pregnancy to be convenient really isn't worth it---babies are the product of a specific and creative thought of God--they are a blessing no matter when they will be delivered.  I really hope you and your husband do NOT have the trouble that my husband and I have found.  I pray that soon you will holding a new bundle of joy in your arms!  God bless you both as you begin your family!|`|94984ec38b601bbbffa6ef2c6cfcb29baa	In order to deliver then, you need to conceive between July and november.|`|edc17bed15804a88f65f2fd8941acbafaa	Try goin at it in September...|`|AA11658682	If you have been on birth control for only six months then you are more than likely to get pregnant right away.  If you go off the pill in say June you will have the baby in march but if you don't get pregnant right away then you still have about five or six months to still have a baby in the spring or summer.    Good Luck and remember to have fun trying.
1819c9477409a8f5ac1f383fdbd03f2faa	what i found:    high caffeine consumption may slightly increase the risk of preterm labor or low birth weight, which could make a difference for a baby who's already at risk for these problems.    Other research has shown that babies of women who got more than 500 mg a day had faster heart rates and breathing rates, and spent more time awake in the first few days after birth. Though the research isn't conclusive, it makes sense to cut back if you're downing more than three cups of java or more than 300 mg a day from all sources  sodas, tea, coffee, and chocolate  combined.    One thing's for sure: You'll feel better if you cut back on caffeine. It's a stimulant, so it increases your heart rate and metabolism and can cause insomnia, nervousness, and headaches. It contributes to heartburn by stimulating the secretion of stomach acid. It's a diuretic, so it makes you pee more often and become dehydrated more easily.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	yes it does and if u didnt know caffein stunts the babies growth|`|JqFQ5r4taa	yes it is possible     when i would eat sugar my daughter would go crazy then knock out after 5 minutes for about `10 minutes then she'd start moving again but more gently     i would say drink it about 10 minutes before bed but then you are up so try some sugar of some sort instead if you need to sleep|`|7f75fd02f40b3159d04aa20ef85d0ad2aa	we|`|eb91bb1a478986b1687a1a29cf093937aa	caffine is not great for a unborn but in small doses its okay!! at 26wks your baby should be moving around loads if it was doing the opposite i would be worried but what your experiance is good and totally normal!!    good luck with the wee one|`|01e1c18faab8478239a6b95f0183b24baa	I have also noticed that if i have a small cup of coffee, my little bugger is a lot more active than usual.
