3N2ElzcQaa	The schools in Japan or other Asian countries<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  <br>  The education is better and scritor. At least you learn useful things, like cooking.<br>  <br>  In America, you learn nothing but English, Math, Science, and History.|`|u9RwzLPnaa	School sucks no matter where you live. Get over it. Because life sucks too. Surprise!!!!<br>  <br>  Who told you life was fair? They lied.|`|ZJrft8a9aa	well I know that the schools in the animes are nothing like real schools in japan<br>  <br>  BUT if they were like anime schools, then those. they look like they would be so much more fun<br>  <br>  If it had t obe like real-live schools in japan then the schools here in the states, only because they are easier (lol, I don't like SCHOOL work)|`|SLBb7uWgaa	I like the school of Japan in terms of uniforms. It looks cool. But in standards, I would prefer States.|`|VKRmIj6Gaa	Schools in Japan! It seems like there is a lot more freedom yet still just as boring as the schools here! >.>|`|Hiasgb75aa	I don't think real school in Japan would be like the animes. But I choose neither.|`|39107aba5959f7a89e699b5489069682aa	I chose neither.<br>  <br>  Schools in Japan are boring and dull they just usually sit around and let the teachers do their work.<br>  <br>  I Don't have any idea of the schools in the US, but I think it's more pleasant than the schools ni Japan but still, school is boring. It really doesn't matter where the school is located but the important thing is it's techniques or the process of the school/teacher that counts and the system too. Anyway, the schools we see on the animes are completely different from reality.<br>  <br>  The one thing I would want to change about school is to go beyond the four walls of the room. Learn more through experiences and situations.|`|Bdgza4G2aa	Definitely the schools in the States.<br>  (by the way, real school in Japan is nothing like in the anime series...such a common misconception with you all)<br>  The only thing that I would change would be this: you can be a brilliant student, get accepted into a great college, but cannot go because you do not have enough money. I would like it if it were judged more on talent rather than social and financial status. But, I do suppose that that is everywhere.|`|RQyRhUqKaa	1. i would say United States school cuz i want to stay in the clothes i wear.<br>  <br>  2. i would make our lunchs more cheaper! our school lunch is so much money. =(|`|G15qwFDJaa	School in the US. Japanese schools are nothing like what you see in anime and the exams are hell. I rather like having free time and a life outside of class and study.

When asked about his allergy, his response was, "That means I lose my voice or I fall asleep in the strangest places..."<br>  <br>  3. Bono, which is a shortened version of Bono Vox, his original nickname, got the name through a group of friends who were known as the Lypton Village. The name, which means "good voice" in Latin, was taken from the name of a hearing aid shop in Dublin.

nukcYkR9aa	Of course. Please follow these guidelines as my kidneys are away:<br>  <br>  1. Never travel to and from night jobs alone. It is never a good idea to walk alone at night, no matter where you are. Ask parents if they can drop you and my kidneys off after a job. <br>   <br>  2. Always make sure that you know where my kidneys are going. Having contact details for me will prove invaluable during an emergency situation. <br>  <br>  3. Have emergency numbers on hand.  Knowing how to locate fire extinguishers and Band-Aids will make your job a whole lot easier with my kidneys. As a final precaution, know how to open door and window locks, in case you need to escape a fire. <br>  <br>  4. Ask about and keep a list any allergies/medical conditions of my/any kidney. An unexpected allergy attack can be harmful, or in rare cases, fatal. Always make sure that you know of any special conditions associated with the kidneys you sit for. If no allergies or medical conditions are reported but unexplained swelling or rashes appear on one of the kidneys, call 911 or Poison Control immediately. <br>  <br>  5. Don't give information to strangers. Keep doors locked when inside and do not open to anyone that looks strange or unfamiliar. Leave one outside light on at night. Answer the phone if I call for my kidneys. <br>  <br>  6. Lock the house if you leave. Locking a house prevents kidney burglaries. Always make sure you have a key to get back in, however, or you may have to make very good friends with the neighbors. If there is a pool, make sure that it is sealed over. <br>  <br>  7. Stay calm in an emergency. Kidneys will panic if you do. It may be a wise idea to review safety tips with kidneys at the beginning of a job. That will prepare them for any emergency situations, in the unlikely event that they occur. <br>  <br>  8. Stay alert. Even if you have an all-night job, try to stay awake for as long as you can. When you sleep, make yourself easily accessible to the kidneys. Accidents can happen at any time, even at night. <br>  <br>  9. Consider a kidney sitter certification course. These courses, offered through health centers in many areas, can certify you to save lives in all emergency situations while making you a better kidneysitter. <br>  <br>  (ps. YES, i know what a kidney is---|`|2BLfykCUaa	yeah but like how do i get them out?|`|G1lSbvAQaa	Only if you let me borrow your kitty kat afterwards!! =P<br>  <br>  And yes I want your pet cat... the actual animal.|`|y9GsC7ogaa	Sure....why the hell not.|`|OCHhJWpHaa	i have trust issues...sorry...XP|`|WWtYCxFhaa	yeah just gimme a sec.......|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	sure|`|kGkUG0fKaa	hmmp...mines not so good!|`|UPN3zqq6aa	my kidneys =O<br>  <br>  NO!<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  <br>  x|`|jxm3yEHRaa	you can have em<br>  <br>  im too nice|`|N0fKhg7vaa	they will be black.|`|XTWClFLQaa	Sure, if I can borrow your brain for tomorrow.|`|kiMF3VDtaa	No problem, I have two of them.|`|teoBeZ6zaa	ah.no?!|`|V8ErN4Vqaa	no,get your own.|`|SHwuzsPyaa	if you do that, i will be dead|`|b29ca239f809536cd3aff56a6f7abe9faa	this question<br>  just made my day|`|aa0M5Mrsaa	will you get drunk and loose em??<br>  <br>  answer my question!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqGiKHJJf0qCLUudDYuwtlzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304153943AAvC6mz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ytGaDM7Haa	sure, just make sure you return them in better condition than you recieved them!|`|Jpgz4mSVaa	i don't think you can have them both at the same time.|`|9o7KlfvKaa	Go find your own kidneys!<br>  I know how you people are.|`|4RTKq5t4aa	get a life I just answered one of your other stupid questions<br>  <br>  I love when kids do this<br>  2 POINTS|`|K4bJgTF4aa	absolutely! here im sending them via email.|`|kKDbi5Zwaa	lemme' borrow that top batch|`|ou7gpgRpaa	If you let me pop your cherry.|`|93IZFDCNaa	okay...

HEDSOHq1aa	religion is a stupid human concept invented to explain the unexplaines, same at the fictional god|`|DHAfDDh9aa	Well, religion is a real thing, so yes I believe in it. But it's only real because it's a practice. To be "religious" means to do things in a certain way and repeatedly. So it is in fact a real thing and I believe it to be so.<br>  <br>  That said, I am not a religious person. I have faith and I am spiritual, but I am not religious. The Bible actually warns against becoming religious. So I may put Christian down when asked my religion, but in truth I do not have one. To be Christian is to follow the path that Christ laid out. To continue his work, to have faith and believe in him. It does not say that I must pray to statues of saints or carry a crucifix, etc. (Or any other religious activity for that matter.)<br>  <br>  Though I do not believe that being religious is a disorder. I believe that some do happen to have a disorder. Usually Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It's common in young females raised in a strict religious home. They must do some things in threes (the trinity) and so forth. But that does not mean that all who worship religiously have a disorder. It is simply how they chose to live.|`|h2i92yA7aa	Religion exists in hundreds of forms.<br>  I believe if it helps people cope with life's mundanity, and it adds quality to their lives, it's not a "neurological disorder".<br>  <br>  p.s.- Mundanity is not a real word.|`|4854FMZjaa	We are ever free if we would only believe it, only have faith enough.

Qplaz9h3aa	kurt nilsen shes so high<br>  edit: everclear also sings it|`|7xJVbzPJaa	It is indeed "She's So High" but the popular version is sung by Tal Bachman<br>  <br>  The chorus is actually <br>  she's so high, high above me, she's so lovely<br>  she's so high, like cleopatra, joan of arc, or aphrodite<br>  <br>  but i could see how you'd get fine instead of high|`|SPaZk6ABaa	She's so high
pYdsOLrQaa	A second season has been confirmed in the newspaper Asahi Shinbun but its air date has not been announced yet.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Currently, no. However, changes made fairly recently to the Japanese Haruhi TV website suggest a new season is in development, and probably will be named after and/or based on "The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya". Current speculation is that it will begin airing in Japan in June, though there's practically no evidence to support this.<br>  <br>  <br>  Go Yuki!|`|yMjocqmUaa	There is only one season. I wish there was more. There was going to be a second season, but it turned out to be a joke and it just ended up airing again. Kyoto is making an anime, K-On! Right now, but maybe after that is done airing, they may make a second season to that, since the fans were so disappointed. :[

6ade8f304e48ef25e16f2a4444611313aa	Look<br>  Molly admitted that she had given Jason her "ALL"<br>  now, we all know what "ALL" means.<br>  She put a hurtin on Jason and he couldn't forget.<br>  Molly is experienced. Im sure of it.<br>  Melissa was a different story. I don't think they went that far.<br>  But<br>  II really believe Melissa would have made a better mother.<br>  Molly is interested in a career.<br>  Jason is going to be disappointed.<br>  He's not 'in love' with Molly.<br>  He's in love with Being in love.<br>  In another month or so, he'll lose interest in Molly.<br>  Watch.<br>  Melissa was right.<br>  He is indeed a b---tard<br>  He just needs a string of women because he doesn't know what he wants.<br>  He's not the kind of man to stick with one woman.<br>  Period.|`|yJCLcFVwaa	I think that perhaps it was something like that, because it is very strange as to what it really is.|`|174ecf3bb83bf13823e446b49ed3fa4daa	Jason is my neighbor, and I can honestly say, he's a good guy. He's a good guy that fell in love with two very different people. The show makes it easy for a relationship to fall into place. They don't call them fantasy dates for nothing! On the show, it's hard to really be yourself, with all the cameras and stuff filming your every breath! My guess is Jason got to know the real Melissa after the taping was over, keeping his feelings for Molly on the back burner, and when he felt in his heart that things just weren't working out with Melissa, broke up with her to pursue a chance with Molly. I'm sure if Jason met Melissa's family, he would have been more sure of his decision.|`|2KRuP7zBaa	No...sex isn't everything, or that would be pretty shallow if that was the reason. Besides, look at the way Jason acted when he sent Molly home. I think he just didn't know what he wanted at the time and realized he still had strong feelings for Molly. Just wish he didn't break up with Melissa on national television though. I just think a lot of the contestants on the show don't realize what each other is like as a person in the real world when the show is over.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I think he wanted both woman.|`|078c9269781f249b467d399b49c9e6b1aa	i think maybe he decided he was in love with the other woman.(the blonde)|`|rGjUyzpoaa	This to me is perplexing! My first reaction is to punch him straight in the kisser. I want to say "be a man, You said it, did you meant it."<br>  My second reaction: Follow your heart, don't marry the wrong one.... odviously there is something about Molly that connected him to her. For God sakes he was crying on the balcony. If I were Melissa that would be the first clue... However, there is no way to rationalize what reasons of the heart. I believe it makes him less of a man the way it all went down. If I were Melissa I would be listening to "white horse, Taylor Swift", If I were Molly I would follow my heart.. Of course tread lightly! I wouldnt want to be second best! <br>  Who knows why he did what he did. Lets hope he made the best decision for him and his son. For Melissa Lets hope she finds her man with the white horse!

Who cares what this person did!? Love yourself and listen to happy music!!!!|`|M8vxlM6laa	Mama's Shoes.  This song is generally played at Christmastime and I don't know why because it is a sad song about a little boy who wants to by a pair of shoes that his dying mother would love to wear "If she meets Jesus tonight".  Many country songs are depressing because they talk about divorce and many sad issues of life.  Hopefully though, you will try to listen to something that can cheer you up instead of depress you more.  Good luck.|`|jQotNGFQaa	I like 'Thought you had my back' by keyshia cole<br>  And<br>   'Red, Red Wine' by UB40 It's depressing... but uplifting at the same time..

cL6CWj2waa	Ragtime was popular between late 1800's and early 1900's. Around 1917 , Jazz hit the scene and took over from Ragtime.<br>  <br>  Ragtime is definitely a pre-cursor to jazz that is correct.<br>  <br>  Scot Joplin is a popular ragtime artist, his playing is very bouncy, jazz, and generally bright and happy.<br>  <br>  The difference between jazz and ragtime, is that ragtime is almost written like a classical piano piece, where as jazz is written now in what is short synthesized form called "jazz charts"<br>  <br>  Ragtime could have evolved into jazz with respect to how chords/theory/beats evolved into other types of beats/sounds - dixieland, swing. Maybe people where tired of the old (as we all get) and when their heard new beats, new ideas, new chords (Duke Ellington practically invented jazz) the crowds were wowed and never looked back.<br>  <br>  But ragtime was heavily influenced by the Europeans and the black culture of the time. Some songs were racist and some of the black composers even had the deragotory "coon" name in their title. So ragtime is the mesh up of black and european culture and the culture of america and the time they were living in.

cUjcn2lsaa	Alt. rock kicks ***. Emo? Sucks ***.<br>  <br>  Seriously, emo is just poser rock.|`|wXv50mNEaa	Alternative rock is a term that emerged in the '80s, synonymous to college rock. It implied underground music that was not widely heard by the American public. It implied little about the genre, but it was generally influenced by punk rock.<br>  <br>  Over the years, it has started to mean less and less. Now days, it basically refers to any new non-metal/hard rock music.<br>  <br>  Emo, on the other hand, is a derivative of hardcore punk also emerged in the '80s. It was more melodic than hardcore punk, and was personal lyrically, rather than social or political.<br>  <br>  Like alternative rock, it has lost its meaning. It nowadays refers to virtually any pop-punk group. The emo culture, on the other hand, is a whole 'nother subject which I will not go into.<br>  <br>  Some key alternative artists are R.E.M. and The Pixies. Some key emo artists are Fugazi and Sunny Day Real Estate.|`|rM2PY9mPaa	well emo music is like a older style of punk or newer style like kinda rock, but sounds sort of pop. alternative rock is just str8 up punk. like nickelback, and three doors down, and stuff like them. do u understand now?|`|kQgSi1MEaa	Most of the time, the lyrics.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sometimes they say "emo" has screaming in it.

I'm kind of lukewarm towards Synchronicity.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggatta_de_Blanc" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggatta_de...</a>|`|k7jGZydJaa	QUEEN (seriously)<br>  The Doors<br>  The Police<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what Mahavishnu Orchestra sounds like though.|`|bfeQ3miMaa	I'd go with Queen, The Doors, and The Police.|`|kwwb62qBaa	Queen, the doors and king crimson|`|m4rSVHhCaa	the police|`|j0zhKhIEaa	Go with the doors|`|opOJPp9uaa	For my money it would be see other options.|`|0vm66wlcaa	I would recommend you purchase<br>  Queen - A Night at the Opera <br>  classic Queen album<br>  The Doors - L.A.

Woman- The Doors<br>  A Night at the Opera- Queen<br>  Synchronicity- The Police<br>  <br>  All are great albums! :D|`|srtoPxN2aa	I personally enjoy them all very much, and in all honesty, you can't go wrong with either...though Mahavishnu Orchestra's  "Visions of the Emerald Beyond" would be my #1 listening choice these days. Upon hearing this album...you will be transported "beyond" the realms of your listening environment. Simply a beautiful sounding album...one of my favorites of the jazz/rock fusion genre.<br>  John McLaughlin(guitar), Jean Luc Ponty(violin), Billy Cobham(drums), and Ralphe Armstrong(bass) were some of the biggest names in jazz/fusion during the 70's, and they all play on this album...highly recommended!<br>  <br>  Here's a few songs -<br>  <br>  Eternity's Breath Parts 1 & 2:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4K1VxNg9Bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4K1VxNg9...</a><br>  Cosmic Strut:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZO50qj0_1A&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZO50qj0_...</a><br>  Lila's Dance:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZdNcXypFSE&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZdNcXypF...</a><br>  Pastoral:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rFrROaP-b8&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rFrROaP-...</a>|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	I would get "L.A Woman", "A Night at the Opera", and "Synchronicity".  I'm not very familiar with the other ones though.|`|AA12301664	you must buy in the court of the crimson king.<br>  <br>  your other choices pale into insignificance next to that|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	The Doors<br>  King Crimson<br>  Queen<br>  <br>  ...in that order, enjoy!
MMYY2cj9aa	Yah me too! I think he's a loser for breaking up with her on national tv. He just looked really confused. I think Melissa should've slapped him, wouldn't it have been great if Molly would've said heck no! We aren't getting back together, you've already dumped me once. Melissa should've kept the diamond!|`|552a230b78bc5b4160481e32addc49e6aa	With knowing HATERS would come out it strobes due to his honesty, I  have to say he did make the right decision.  The decision to follow his heart should NOT be based on those who preferred Melissa over Molly, it solely his choice and his life.  Since we don't know what transpired over those 6 weeks they had off air together who's to say.  Obviously, something changed.  People I'm sure are on their best behavior on television and when they first start getting to know one another. I feel, even though sad that Melissa was hurt, it's best to be honest with oneself, an especially when a child is involved.  It takes a lot of guts to do what he did.  In the end we are all responsible for our own happiness, not on what others think.<br>  <br>  I know I'lll get thumbs down for my opinion because people want us to do what they want us to do.  I'm definitely for telling it like it is.|`|iUleAtaAaa	I do, yes.  If he is, in fact, following his heart, then that is the thing to do.  I would have hated he wait months and then break Melissa's heart.  We have all been through a broken heart, and Melissa was SO into him, that it would have just been worse had he waited.  He obviously is in love with Molly, and to have just strung Melissa along, would have been CRUEL!<br>  <br>  I believe he does care for Melissa, he's just not IN LOVE with her.  There's a difference between "loving" someone, and being "in love" with them.  So, while he may LOVE Melissa, it is obvious (I guess, LOL) that he is IN LOVE with Molly!|`|YxUFcvetaa	OMG that was sooooo emotional!!!! I liked melissa at first, and was SOO happy, but you could tell she changed. So im glad he dumped her|`|c3d52c8bb69764f274e5cebcecf18a5daa	I was really hoping that he would pick Melissa as well, and was happy when he did.  I can understand, having doubts, he was having them, just trying to chose between Melissa and Molly.  He should have  taken more time, right then.  It would've been better than hurting both women.  Molly, when he chose Melissa, then Melissa when he dumped her and took Molly.|`|2KRuP7zBaa	Well, first of all, everyone thinks Brad was a jerk for not choosing a woman at the end during his season, but I always disagreed with everyone because at least he was being true to himself and followed his heart. If your not in love with that person, than you have no business proposing to them. It's obvious Jason wasn't too sure of himself and needed more time. I think he shouldn't have proposed to any of the girls and maybe openly dated them a little longer in the real world and see what he really wanted.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	Well, if he really loved Molly more, than he made the right choice.  I don't like how he handled it though.|`|uKXgg9heaa	He made the right decision for him and that's all that matters.
DUqzR7FWaa	i dont really like any of them but id pick taylor just cause i dont like rob at all|`|xFVjLpdYaa	both!<br>  <br>  well actually, I like Rob's character better,<br>  but he looks like a hobo.<br>  I hate Taylor's character,<br>  but he's hawt times ten!<br>  (but never as much as Bill Kaulitz)|`|7R1VYuQ2aa	Taylor|`|OJXfV529aa	I am in love with Robert.<br>  Like im engaged to him in my own world.<br>  But alot of people say Taylor is hotter.<br>  <br>  But then again, Taylor is kinda cocky. People say Rob is too, but no one watches his interviews, hes not at all.<br>  And Rob does not only take showers once every three weeks, that a lie.<br>  One time in an article he said he hadnt washed his hair in 6 weeks, that was an exageration, he said it himself in an interview. He said that he was exagerating, but everyone took it seriously.<br>  <br>  I love Robert forever & always.|`|ohQGpF0Naa	Taylor ;D|`|buJCtC54aa	i think taylor is better lookin definetly =)|`|c7b96f6c7f158494077ce2d9ff1b0b29aa	i LOVE ROBERT PATTINSON. hes sooo frieken hot. ive seen a couple interviews of him on youtube. and he seems very funny.not to crazy about the hair but i guess thats his package.. i never really liked taylor lautner, maybe its his character he plays. and with the long hair or perhaps its bc hes 17 and im 23.... idk i just never thought taylor was really attractive. i wish i could met robert.|`|AA12273026	depends what you're looking for really, i saw this magazine article that compared the two like in personality. it was 17 i think,<br>  <br>  well, i like good boys, so taylor.<br>  but if you like bad boys, robert.<br>  and if you like your boys gorgeous, both! :)|`|tQ9CnPfyaa	It's a total fact. TAYLOR LAUTNER is amazing. there, that's all the reason u need. <br>  <br>  Besides, Pattinson takes showers like once every three weeks. No wonder is hair is all oily. anyways, thumbs up for Lautner!!!!!!!!!!!|`|x7fXMjHRaa	letting the characters they play aside...i like taylor he is really cute but there is something about rob i really love he is so mysterious and unlike all those other celebrities i hope he doesnt change...plus he is sooooo handsome!!!!|`|Y0lDf0LRaa	Uh definitely ROBERT.. he's what you call a real man. he's the total package baby<3.. looks, talent, personality..|`|YxUFcvetaa	ahhh!! i love them both both hare sexyyy and have good personalitiess. team switezerland :]|`|hpu4s84Waa	i asked that same question! :) and a lot of people say that they like rob better. for me it's really hard to choose because i like them for different reasons.<br>  Taylor- he's hot as hell! have you seen those abs? and he seems more out there like me, and he is hilarious!<br>  Rob- I DO NOT LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE PLAYED EDWARD CULLEN!<br>  i like him because he is faithful to being abstinent and a christian and is down to earth and i love that in a guy. :) (i'm also abstinent)<br>  see very different. but there is a lot more.<br>  so i would have to say it is a tie. (and yes i do like guys that are out there or down to earth... but i like down to earth better)

QpssXle0aa	If you look the part it should be fine, however if you don't I'm pretty sure you will need an ID. The thing with R-rated movies is they aren't trying to keep out the poor, but those who are younger. Older people are needed as their tickets too. <br>  <br>  They don't want to get blamed for a minor seeing an inappropriate movie.|`|dJfvy8Cvaa	See if your mom or dad will go with you to the ticket booth to pick up the ticket, then once you have the ticket in hand I don't think they can deny you entry.  But that also depends on how old you look, if you look 17 or 13.|`|XDF2Lh1uaa	If they have a ticket machine, you might want to get your tickets that way.  Still, they might very well ask for ID when they tear your ticket, particularly for this movie.  Going with the legal options... try and bring someone older along?  If your parents gave you their credit card to buy the tickets then maybe they can give permission for you to go in.|`|OPOPPTjbaa	You have two popular options to work with; You can either sneak into this movie without paying, or if you're a good Christian, you'll pay to see another movie and just hop to Watchmen.
dfb4a1ebd47e08f0a2763df490af255aaa	OMG yes!! It is my new obsession!! I really liked the first Underworld movie but I wasn't too crazy about Underworld: Evolution - but I think Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is definitely the best movie of the trilogy.  I always wanted to see Lucian's story since we got those brief flashbacks in the first movie because he was my favourite character from Underworld and Rise of the Lycans definitely didn't disappoint - it was brilliant!!! I thought Michael Sheen was fantastic - absolutely perfect for the role!  I've just started reading the novelization which is really good too and the DVD is due to be released on 18 May. x|`|DG2Nv8vkaa	I thought the movie was good and enjoyable, and as others have said better than the second one. For me the first one is still the best one. Although this last one was a little inconsistent in places. If you watch the flashback in the first film i think it is, where you are shown Viktor (Bill Nighy) finding out about his daughters and Lucian's relationship and then having her killed. It is not like how it then looked in this last film.|`|0CX9XBvlaa	I actually thought it was perhaps one of the worst movies I had ever seen. Whoever cast Michael Sheen for that role was an idiot! He looked like an pumped up chicken on steroids! It was so ridiculous. All I kept thinking was why is David Frost kissing that pale woman! There is no way his character was convincing. He couldn't lead an army of ants never mind an army go werewolfs. There was no real chemistry between Sonja and Lucian. Rubbish!!!|`|3cpa6ZX5aa	I've seen the first two but not this one yet though i really want too! I haven't really had anytime as my twin sons have been a bit poorly so i haven't had time to go to the cinema. My husband has promised to take me on sunday so i can't wait! The reviews for it are really good so i'm really looking forard to it!|`|KlkUj6uFaa	I really enjoyed the movie and thought it was the best too.|`|1qUokeKOaa	yea it is but i think they rushed the second one

u1yA9Kpiaa	Because movie fight scenes need to be dramatic, they tend to have their own style of fighting. What they show in the movie is theatrical fencing. It looks like fencing, but they tend to ignore some of the more practical rules to make it more exciting to watch. Such as crossing swords or throwing their weapon. Both of which are not a good tactical moves. I believe at one point one if not both of them are fighting with a knife in their 'off hand'. That is a style of fencing, but they mix in other moves from other forms of sword fighting. Fencing is a slashing type of sword fighting, not so much a stabbing. <br>  <br>  So in short it is a theatrical style of fighting made to resemble historical fencing.|`|AF5kDniiaa	Fencing is defined as the art or sport of fighting with swords (especially the use of foils or epees or sabres to score points under a set of rules). So you could refer to it as fencing as it is the 'art of fighting with swords' however in contemporary common usage, fencing tends to refer specifically to the modern Olympic sport. So whilst you would be correct to refer to it as fencing, to avoid confusion I personally would just call it 'sword fighting' or 'swordsmanship'.|`|QRxEoEtBaa	Fencing|`|7c41d0650d2d056239986df304fa0bb4aa	sparring. fencing has an outfit|`|8a1003a8e944c1c1e1968057edfe9aebaa	Swordsmanship...mabye...(refers to the skills of a swordsman, a person versed in the art of the sword)...lol...thats my favrite movie evea...Hope i helped!..=D

Ice-T replaced Jeffreys early on.  Cabot was the original, replaced by Casey.  Now there's a new girl whose name I don't know because Casey got disbarred.  <br>  Dan Florek (Captain) was on regular Law and Order in the early 90s as well as Chris Noth<br>  <br>  CI started 2002/2003?- Goren and Eams and the ME have been there since the begining.

lpyWVR2oaa	There're many chart indicators why you two tend to get on each other's nerves.<br>  <br>  First and foremost, you are essentially more Earth in temperament than she is (she being very Fire dominated as well). The impulsiveness, initiative qualities in her will clash big time with your more Virgoan nature of conservatism, traditionalism. Both signs are perfectionist and self-critical, but you more so than her. And having planets in Libra means that you're afraid to rock the boat when it comes to certain decisions, afraid that the peace and harmony will be shattered. <br>  <br>  Although she is an Earth sign, the fire aspect of her cannot be disregarded. She is likely to be the go-getter, impatient sort who lives for the next big excitement. Her Sun in 1st House points to her need to shine as an individual, to make things happen, to be acknowledged and recognized as a person. You tend to keep your emotions inward and dont seem to be too demonstrative and this is another reason for the trigger of your discord.|`|7U2SFpkraa	I'm a Virgo... and umm yes they bore me<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|Pew3CdCjaa	that's my question as well<br>  <br>  I am cap girl.<br>  I dated two virgo man.. they are very boring and do not have goal in their life... but hard working so I think they are very stupid and not efficient<br>  <br>  how did you think?<br>  I think virgo sucks|`|dibBENqWaa	Thats because you'lls moon sign isn't compatible

mTHIfYdFaa	For A major, try<br>  A string 12th fret - pinky<br>  D string 11th fret - ring finger<br>  G string 9th fret  - index finger<br>  <br>  Slide this whole pattern down a fret position and you've got Ab major. Down one more and it's G major. Anywhere you copy this pattern, whatever note your pinky is on is the chord.<br>  <br>  For A minor keep the A and G strings the same but do <br>  D string 10th fret - middle finger. Again, move this pattern around and it's a minor chord anywhere.

B43x5RF8aa	You got me!!
VquZAwfHaa	Absolutely! I'd like to experience everyday normal things as a man just to see how people may or may not respond to me differently then when I was a woman. And I'd want to experience sex/masturbation too.|`|AjFC8mEFaa	no, because i like who i am. i'm fine being a girl.|`|cYO2jU1Taa	YES!<br>  so i can know what girls wanna hear from guys. =]|`|1701d61f01c228136967b6fef841a4bdaa	hells ya, play with myself all day woo fun|`|lwccQoEZaa	No, I enjoy being a girl !!|`|XYnXpyrfaa	no. i like my penis too much.|`|M6piKNYSaa	No, I would never want to be a man.|`|uQkLo6ZTaa	I would want to be a boy because I would like to know their perspective on girls. Also I would have a sleepover to see what boys talk about. I would want to be the guy I have a crush on because I would tell all of "my" friends that I loved myself (before switching back). Then we would be all set.|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	Totally. And honestly- even though you probably can't put this into your school project- I'd totally have sex!! <br>  I just think it would be really interesting in general to experience life from a guy's pov. I would want my whole mind to be changed too, want to think just like the guy I would be...|`|JjS4ARPYaa	I don't know, it would be interesting, but girls have to do a lot, that would just make me so mad, even for one day, but it would be interesting to see what and how much they really went thru.|`|aa0M5Mrsaa	i would cuz i think being a guy would be easy<br>  and i hope guys switch with girls on the day of their hardest period day!<br>  just so they stop giving us sh*t for it!<br>  <br>  answer my question! plz peeps!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304153943AAvC6mz&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|pJGZEpL7aa	I would because then I could probably become friends with a crush and see if he likes me back, or at least what does he think of me.|`|npeJPCvyaa	Yes, because I'm bored of being myself and I wanna know how guys think differently than girls.|`|dMvsVqS2aa	I totally would!<br>  I think it would be interesting to see what its like to be a guy..|`|hgi7ohCZaa	Yes I would love to have a chance to be a dude, but I would never EVER stay that way permanently.<br>  <br>  GO GIRLS!|`|0SZF4U0Uaa	I wouldn't, I'd be afraid something would go wrong and I couldn't change back.

LOL|`|dnwJmNkdaa	Yes... I would totally go to my gyms locker room and pretend i was texting while i was really getting prime shots for tomorrows enjoyment... gotta love camera phones|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	Yes cus then i could have boobs|`|dhj3ynjeaa	sure! but only for a day though...i think it's better to be a girl :D but i'd like to see how guys are for a while lol|`|Onh6soTEaa	Yea why not...i'd get the scope on what the girl's think about me.  Pretend to walk into the wrong dressing room were the hot girl is changing and take a quick snap shot on the phone and later play with myself.   LOL you asked|`|XTWClFLQaa	Yes, it would be so interesting seeing things through another perspective ^^|`|XvjXrCffaa	No cuz then i'll have to like boys for a day and im not gay<br>  unless if i am lesbian<br>  <br>  <br>  wow tat was weird typing tat|`|MiKrWuM6aa	No, I would stay a woman.<br>  <br>  The slight chance of getting hit in the nuts frightens me lol.|`|y299k5j8aa	Nah that's what plastic surgery is for.|`|Ty5dBpFDaa	YES!

I'd love to be someone's Prince Charming|`|Emk4xuTuaa	No, I enjoy being a woman.|`|uxqkJEIcaa	Yes, because I of course wanna know what it's like. <br>  <br>  For example, I will never not have boobs and I wanna know what it's like not having them. I know it would be an inconvenience (bra makes a pocket). Also, I wanna stand up and pee without it running down my legs (I've never done that, I just assume).<br>  <br>  You're welcome.|`|VvX51zueaa	A fantastic question. I would try on all the sexy gear I like seeing attractive girls wearing. Then pick up a man for lots of naughty behaviour. Not very imaginative, but it would be great to experience things on the other side.|`|GIEezBRiaa	ye to find out what you girls think and how ur minds work. sorta like that mel gibson movie, forgot what its called, but ye, get the million dollar question, how do girls think.|`|9o7KlfvKaa	I would definitely enjoy the experience for one day. I would be interested to see how I'd be thinking, how I'd be treated by others, et cetera. It would be a wonderful learning experience :)|`|VRHrppXRaa	I would so I could try and get pregnant... and once I turn back into a man, I'd inflate like a balloon and explode from the inside out. And then I'd be famous. "Man mysteriously explodes in public" would be the headlines|`|FOImYHocaa	just as long as I would be able to switch back the next day. I think it would be a cool experience for one day.. see really just how their brain works.|`|om3N441xaa	I would get "first hand experience" in what it is like to be a controlling boss with menopausal symptoms at the same time.....Then I would KNOW the real truth behind the actions......!!!!|`|6W2imvnaaa	Yes, I always wanted to know what girls talk about and find out who likes me. But only for a day.|`|kiMF3VDtaa	Good grief no, I am a girl, and I am sometimes mean to boys, I would hate to be a boy for the day.|`|1iXvphNYaa	Yes, to understand what labor pains really feel like.|`|CsnRznSNaa	Yeah, why not? I mean it would be interesting to see how a guy really thinks. ahah|`|2hMhANqDaa	yea i would because i want to know what the hell guys are thinking when they do the stupid things they do
lGdzb8aqaa	she is looking good but a little tan would not hurt.<br>  Adrienne Danielle Frantz (born June 7 , 1978 in Mount Clemens , Michigan )<br>  Michael Graziadei:   <br>  Birthday: September 22, 1979|`|vqUVWPBAaa	Amber was a high school graduate on Bold and the Beautiful in the late 90's, so, I doubt she could have been born in 1989. She has to be at least 30. But to answer, your question, nah, I am straight, Amber is not my type.<br>  It is not uncommon for an actor to much older than the character they are playing. The young man playing Noah will be 21 in August and Noah just turned 16.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Yes,,,Amber has always been hot.<br>  <br>   I think she is in her early 30's > ( 31 or 32 ) and I think Daniel is much younger as you say ( Amber was the 'older woman' when she was on Bold & Beautiful ( she was the nanny and hooked up with a 17 year old ) actually they got married . ( Rick Forrester > not this one though)|`|4kuWOZowaa	Amber isnt hot..but im starting to like her and kevins connection..but yes she is wayy older than daniel..of course daniel might be older than we thing to.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yeah, she is pretty and she is in her 30's..|`|VAp5ICaBaa	She's cute I wouldn't say hot but I think in real life she's only a year older than him|`|qWzN3i3Uaa	She is pretty good looking for her age<br>  Daniel looks pretty young but when i looked him up he is actaully only a year younger. He was born on September 22 1979 and she was born on June 7 1989. Shocking isn't it,  i thought they were

SAaEiqHvaa	Rap/Hip-hop was always the voice of the people, so your flow can be as meaningful as you make it...<br>  <br>  hard cut throat industry not easy to get in, especially with pop.. they always want something that is marketable, a look, a hook, a unique sound, something they can make money from.. but easiest way to start is just write write write... record lyrics over backing tracks post on you tube, you never know who might be watching...<br>  <br>  and good luck with it..

That will be fun. But so far as a new "Girls next Door" show,,,I don't think I will be able to get into it. Holly really loved Hef, and Bridget is such a neat person, and Kendra was so fun,,,,,,,,,,but any new girls will just seem whorish,,,,,,,,sorry, but that's the way I feel.....The last 3 actually cared about Hef, but any new ones will just be cheesy....|`|0GFUEO7taa	No way. I can't stand the twins. I love Holly, Kendra and Bridget and for Heff to try to spin the show off with his new girlfriends will be aweful. I will not watch it. I will definitely watch Kendra's new show|`|b9816OKRaa	i was told they were still going to show kendra and bridget not the new girls but if they use his new chicks they will lose me as a viewer for sure|`|ZEiPGG0jaa	it won't be the same..i probably wont watch it
0f335c54c170fe2c01d7008662459bd3aa	As with any war, you must seek to crush them at the core. It will only escalate otherwise. When it comes to pranks, you absolutely must do something that is either a massive inconvenience, or publically embarassing. For the latter, I don't mean digging up some embarassing fact about them as that isn't a prank at all (it's just cruel). Don't play on their existing emotions as that can cross the lines of bullying. <br>  <br>  Find a way to convince them into thinking they won a contest or something, or if you can get a teacher in on it then hand out a fake pop-quiz where their answers are impossibly hard compared to everyone else's. <br>  For inconveniences, try and get ahold of as many paper shreds as you can. Find paper waiting to be recycled, or chip in and buy hundreds of sheets (you must be willing to invest if you are to win a prank war, and for something like this you need the most material you can get to be the biggest inconvenience). Then you just need get it all into their bookbags or lockers. You might even be able to squeeze a deflated balloon into a locker, fill it, tie it, and push it completely in (repeat until no more balloons fit). Better yet, purchase as much salt as you can afford (I'm talking pounds of it) and funnel it all in. It shouldn't ruin anything and would brush off things easily enough, but it would still be inconvenient to find such a pile of salt in your book bag or locker. <br>  <br>  If you're low on time (time is crucial for good pranks), just find one of those cards that let you pre-record an audio message on it. Record a clip of whatever song kids your age would hate (Celiene Dion or something), open it up, and slip it into their locker (only really works if the card continues to repeat. If not you might have to rig it up so that the card opens when the door does). Hopefully people will assume it is their phone or mp3 player going off and would forever question their taste in music.<br>  <br>  Is this prank war entirely in school, and generally how strict is your school? (like if you were to saran-wrap someone's lock, would the school mistake this for bullying?)|`|tr5ig7eXaa	you could go with the classic whoopie cushion.<br>  <br>  Find out what the other teams players are afraid of.<br>  <br>  if they are afraid of spiders find a dead spider and put it in there desk.<br>  find out what embarasses them. go around with a video camera and tape them. then post the really embarassing stuff on youtube, or make a dvd of it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  =~D|`|3JuiUj33aa	scare them, rig traps all around the place surprise someone, just use as many new tricks as possible if not they might be able to see it coming especially if they are being cautious so dont get too sloppy if you start getting better etc. etc. etc.|`|HYySRW6Zaa	place plastic wrap under toilet seat, but above bowl, so when they crap, it is time to say, "PHYSICAL CONTACT!!!"|`|eRKIfrVfaa	Sting on door rigged so balloons drop. Drop water balloonson them 15 feet in the air. Send fake love notes. Send threats that someone gonna kill tem. Give them horriblle tasting candy coated in **** or something. Give them gum covered with glue, makes their mouth sticky|`|3MmVWDT3aa	Hahahahaha I just thought of one! If you know the people like friends, or someone on your team does, then make sure you have their pictures on a computer. You can go to a website where it has TONS of famous people on there, and you can paste a photo of their head onto their head, so it looks like it is them. Sorry if i'm not clear, but my sister did one of my brother to the body of Shakira--it was SO funny!<br>  Just look it up on google.<br>  <br>  Randomly go up to them and say high five, when they raise their hand up high say, "Who's a loser?" and then throw your hand down real fast.<br>  <br>  -Olivia<333

t60dlhX7aa	The best thing to do, is basically keep everything professional during practices.  Make sure that you're pretty friendly to the entire band and treat each of them with the SAME respect.  Also, try getting solos and stuff during concert band.  Make sure that you at least look like you know what you're doing when you try out for being the field commander.  Also, try getting help from past field commanders.  Ask your band director(s) for resources (like tutorials and stuff), to let them know you are interested.

7761a0e82f2aca8d02650411bc0f2fafaa	Heh, there's probably one band I'm sure could ever be close to being named the worst band ever.<br>  <br>  Listening to brokenCYDE requires some level of tolerance.  Since screaming has become the new "octave" (barely, I know) , there's always going to be those bands that experiment.  Screamo rock, screamo rap (I doubt you'll dig that), and then there's screamo techno.  It's just a genre you know you won't want to listen to.  It might not be the band itself.|`|mE1YiekAaa	i don't mind it, it really isn't that bad, but opinion is opinion idc for them much though|`|3MG9grcfaa	Well thats just sayin<br>  "how can anyone stand to listen to any screamo band?"<br>  If you like screaming and sexy beats, u like brokencyde<br>  if you dont, then ya dont.<br>  but GET CRUNK is still a good song, no matter how u look at it.|`|SeqyHojCaa	I agree, they have no talent.

I want to slap her and ask her parents why they didn't raise her to be more humble and what they are doing to correct it.<br>  <br>  She might eventually end up like Britney.

aIZfiU6Kaa	I think most people, myself included will have seen one, but what is it? by definition as the name implies, it's an object or other phenomenon seen in the sky, apparently flying, and of unknown origin and nature, at that time and place, to that observer.<br>  <br>  They usually turn out to be  weather balloons, science projects, meteors, regular airline flights, and other relatively mundane events.<br>  <br>  If you are implying that they are from other planets, unlikely in the extreme but not impossible.<br>  <br>  Because of the vastness of the universe it's statistically almost impossible that we are alone, but because of that vastness it's extremely unlikely that a 'flying saucer' would or could travel all that way and not leave any evidence.<br>  <br>  Since the first ever sighting of UFOs, there is not one single shred of reliable evidence of them ever existing, but once some have been seen, it's amazing how many other people claim to have seen them also.<br>  <br>  Randi who I often quote on such matters once went to give a question and answer talk on a radio network many years ago, and just to see what the response would be claimed on air that on his way he had seen several UFOs in formation and described them in detail, guess what? while he was still on air about a dozen other people phoned in claiming they had seen the same UFOs and described them down to the last detail.|`|wmBK9uASaa	I thought I did once but I got an explanation for it about a year later,I do however believe in them,|`|7n4rtfp6aa	YES I HAVE!!!<br>  on telly<br>  :(|`|XZFbyD58aa	Yes.. ive seen one in Melbourne Australia.. when i was about 18 (not drunk or on drugs) me and a friend 100% definatly seen a ufo.  It was a small light in the sky (about the size of a little finger nail) probably about 5 k's up in the air. it flew half way across my prefrial vission and stopped roughley above us.had a bit of mevement then shot back of in the oppisite direction..  We definatley both seen this u.f.o and it is impossable that the australion army have this sort of technoledhy..    you really should watch  "guy kills two grey aliens" on youtube. it is very interesting. We know what we saw, and thats that so???|`|6GXSNJt5aa	Yes I have. I have seen a UFO on more than one occasion.  I was close enough to see that what I was looking at was some type of craft.|`|odKmX3qbaa	i believe theres something there|`|55QyAEPXaa	NO, I HAVEN'T, I THINK THAT'S A BIG LIE!<br>  THAT'S NOT TRUE!

But, they couldn't<br>  leave the plus size girls out<br>  cause some people would<br>  complain about it.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	I modeled for about a year and stopped because I was not happy. That whole world is crazy and you will never get judged more in your life. It has its perks though... money of course and it is fun at the shoots. You meet a lot of awesome people, etc.<br>  <br>  The reason behind them needing to be skinny is that fact that the camera really does add ten pounds. Also you need to be able to fit the clothes. 4 sizes in the same outfit are not available. Last but not least.... its the prime image that sparks the want of others. You see a beautiful girl wearing an amazing dress and you want to look JUST LIKE THAT! Believe it or not its just marketing.|`|5jqfKDdfaa	They are trying to introduce the trend of a "full sized" model....shes not a plus size, but shes got curves (most notably a 6 pack) and she wears normal sizes....

oxBv4gOiaa	okay. No you cannot just drag it to where you want. go to paint and make a new picture. Okay, you with me??? Now, choose any color you want, perferably black, and save put in your Windows Media Collections(where your pictures show). Now, click and drag the picture onto the time bar and adjust the picture to HOW LONG YOU WANT THE CLIP TO BE. Then afterwords, just click and drag your NEXT picture onto the time bar and let go of it NEXT to your other picture? If that doesn't do you good, email me at centralcelebspanel@yahoo.com(my alternate address)|`|cuh4ERU9aa	umm usually, there is a regular arrow when you go to the line the clip starts on.

ojEkgJoqaa	first of all they seem like unfit parents. i mean you don't say that to your children no matter what.<br>  <br>  honestly the best thing to do is not respond. they are looking for a response or a reaction. Don't give them the pleasure of that<br>  <br>  I know it is hard and believe me i have experienced the same stuff but it got physical. but you know what verbal abuse can be worse<br>  <br>  by responding is giving them what they want. a reaction<br>  <br>  best bet be mature and ignore them.i know it is hard and they are your parents but no parent should treat their child this way.<br>  <br>  or maybe go out more often and spend time with good friends or even relatives.<br>  <br>  i am sorry to hear that but that has worked for me<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|aa0M5Mrsaa	midols might help =D<br>  move out<br>  i would! <br>  <br>  answer my question! plz peeps!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304153943AAvC6mz&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|X2Y5D8ycaa	"my mom is a girl" <br>  I sure hope she is.|`|h2i92yA7aa	My mother's the most cruel, ungodly bit*ch on this earth. <br>  and now I'm finally 18. so I don't have to deal with her anymore. <br>  <br>  All I can say is try to ignore them, or call them on it. like say "Wow, mom, and I thought "I" was immature". She might lay off a bit.<br>  and since you're probably more clever than them as well, you can insult them in an indirect and subtle way. <br>  you know, just to make yourself feel better. <br>  trust me, they won't have a clue that you just insulted them :]<br>  <br>  I really hope 17 flies by for you. Once you're 18, a LOT changes when it comes to dealing with your antagonistic parents|`|OIQde3sAaa	yes|`|dGLuM1cEaa	people (even parents) put down other people (sometimes their own kids) to make themselves feel better.<br>  Ignoring them is THE best possible thing to do. If you all are at the table and they start fussing and stuff, just say something like, "good night" and get up and leave. Go to your room, blow off some steam, call somebody, listen to music. <br>  I know it's hard dealing with your parents, but you don't have too much longer that you have to live with them. <br>  Don't fight fire with fire, that's all I'm saying, and having someone to talk to helps so so much.<br>  My parents can get unbareable at times, (and I'm 17, too) and I couldn't live without my sister and my friends to vent to. <br>  You'll make it, I promise.|`|AA10325228	Two words: Move out!|`|Sydg0cjsaa	wow thanks so much for clarifying that your mom is a girl- i was really confused on that bit.

AA11946996	In your future you will grow older & wiser! You can never stay as you are.|`|AA11951392	Your birth on the 9th day of the month adds a tone of idealism and humanitarianism to your nature. You become one who can work easily with people because you are broadminded, tolerant and generous. You are ever sensitive to others' needs and feelings, and even if the other numbers in your core makeup don't show it, you are very sympathetic and compassionate. Your feeling run deep and you often find yourself in dramatically charged situations. This 9 energy always tends to give more that it gets.<br>  <br>  Personal Year for Number: 6 is about A year to focus on home life, the duties & responsibilities of your family & close community.<br>  <br>  The influence for this year is about emotional security, love & happiness. Be careful though, that you are not treated like a doormat or that you become a martyr but, you must understand the occasional need for sacrifice. This is a time to help serve your family, partner, children, & close friends. This vibration emanates love, beauty & issues of the heart. This would be a good time to beautify & remodel the home & garden or perhaps purchase or sell real estate. Have a new makeover, change your hairstyle, pamper & treat yourself. Enjoy the pleasure of romance, love & possibly marriage. If already married, rekindle your marriage vows or go on a second honeymoon. Financial gain is imminent & you should do well in your business dealings. This is not a year in which to be selfish, this is a good time to resolve tensions. Try to understand & consider everyone’s needs, be as giving as possible. Activities will be slow moving so don’t try to hurry things along. Be creative with your feelings in any activity you undertake & you will experience immense satisfaction in all you undertake. To obtain the most out of this vibration, take some time out to relax, have faith, but do not shirk your responsibilities. This is a year to enjoy your home & loved ones. <br>  <br>  Love & Blessings <br>  Milly
2PTlXs9zaa	CEEECilia - you're breaking my heart, your shaking my confidence DAIILyYY -<br>   I don't know the McD fish song, and something tells me I don't really want to. Elton was my get over cecilia song, we'll go with some good Ol' John Denver today!|`|Rx6p8Cvfaa	thank gawd i can't think of how either go right now...but my kids have that song by flo rida and fergie ayer, stuck in my head..|`|aq2ssmy9aa	By Cecilia, I assume you are talking about a song.<br>  <br>  Therefore, my suggestion would be to listen repeatedly to Cecilia until the song gets stuck in your head once more, then avoid thinking about McDonald or its fish song for a while. Try searching on Youtube for the tune, if it helps.<br>  <br>  I know from experience that sometimes when songs get stuck in your head when you're imagining a different song, they replace that song in what I like to call "your mind's song playlist", and then you find it hard to replace it with the song you were imagining prior to having that other song get stuck in your head. What usually helps me, and what I recommend trying, is listening to the song that you want to imagine again until it gets stuck in your mind once more.<br>  <br>  I hope that you find this useful, and enjoy listening to Cecilia! :)

8d9bafe53900ed8aed126e1212f02d87aa	After seeing how he handled the whole thing, I would say that he probably did have contact with her ... I agree with Melissa, I have totally lost all respect.  Here is my feelings about the whole thing:<br>  <br>  What it comes down to is that the man does not know is own mind. I just had a feeling when Molly said "I think you are making a huge mistake" that it would eat at him and that is exactly what happened.  Plus, he is a HORRIBLE example of how someone should conduct themselves. If he was such a good person, he would have broke up with Melissa off-camera (which we now know that he could have done) then come on the final rose show, talked about the break-up, then talked to Molly. All he was concerned about was his "feelings". Oh please, who injected you with female hormones you stupid moron? Get some gonads!|`|XZi4UJgGaa	I guess he did, but then again, he dated around 20 women at the same time in a few months for the show before he made up his mind between Melissa and Molly. The first Bachelor ever did the same thing, and thats how Trista became the Bachelorette. He chose Amanda but was contacting Trista in case the relationship doesn't work out. Only he didn't break up with her on national tv. Would dating 20 women at the same time be cheating then? With the situation, there would be a very fine line as to what exactly is cheating. It's no wonder these relationships don't work.<br>  <br>  Also, Melissa's parents didn't approve. The rumor is that Melissa said she wanted to take things slow and get to know each other better. Then Jason didn't take it well and starts seeing Molly. Supposedly he feels Melissa becoming more distant.<br>  <br>  After reading the Yahoo article, I think Jason should have told Melissa the truth instead of totally blindsiding her-that he was going to dump her and was contacting Molly. That was really mean of him not to tell her.

Also consider contacting the Pittsbugh newspaper or library for info.<br>  <br>  If not there then perhaps they may know where else to check.  <br>  <br>  I have a background in radio but it's in Chicago & San Diego and I'm apparently quite a bit younger than your mom.  <br>  <br>  I hate to tell you but I doubt they would have tapes from way back then.

EvxVrGPQaa	I totally agree with you. Everyone is always complaining about the fact that she is smoking. But come on, it is her life, right? Who are we as fans, haters, stalkers or you name it to judge her on what she does. There are millions of people on the world who are smoking, but because she is a celebrity, people find it such a big deal. It's not like she smokes in front of her fans or something. I know she is a roll model, but a mother that smokes is also a roll model for her children, so that is wrong too.<br>  <br>  I'm absolutely fine with the fact that she smokes, I do it myself, am I a bad person now? <br>  <br>  People should start worrying about other things than the fact that she smokes. Leave the girl alone, for christ sake.|`|OJXfV529aa	I dont personally care, but other people do probably cause shes supposed to be a role model.<br>  <br>  It is her life though, and its not really anyones business, but pot is disgusting.|`|qlCHegC5aa	...I don't think most people care.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	well she's bella and a role model for crazy fans.......|`|uhHfm3Azaa	its not a big deal if anyone smokes.<br>  its a big deal that they picked her to portray bella when she has no charisma and is completely monotonous.|`|cXPVtTUJaa	I'm fine with her smoking cigarettes, although I don't really like the smell... but I don't think that it was right when she did pot... and that bathing suit of hers...

I just don't want her lifestyle to affect the movie... but other than that I'm fine with her acting the way she does.   :]|`|whVbcYN7aa	She is a role model for people, and that's a disgusting habit that isn't something you want to look up to. its disappointing.<br>  its annoying finding questions like these. because if they bother you whey would you read them?<br>  <br>  i heard it was pot she was smoking not cigarettes. that's probably why.|`|7lZnHiYZaa	i really don't care because i don't care for her...<br>  but she IS setting a bad example for young girls..|`|EFzXvfbQaa	i don't care

NYiHSnTFaa	He proposed to her, gave her an engagement ring valued at 65 or 85K and then on the After the Final Rose show, called her out on stage and dumped her in front of everyone.  Then as soon as she walked off the stage he asked the runner up in the show to start dating him.  <br>  It was all predicted and spoiled on the Internet weeks ago, why it came as such an absolute shock to so many I'll never understand.|`|552a230b78bc5b4160481e32addc49e6aa	I was wonder what Melissa did to Jason to make him change his mind so fast...You could always watch it on abc.com.  <br>  <br>  Basically Jason picked Melissa over Molly, who were the last two girls left.  He proposed that night on the show..6 weeks later he had a change of heart and told Melissa he never really forgot about Molly.  He was honest even though his honesty brought about a lot of haters.  It took a lot of guts to tell it like it is, for many viewers disapproved of his decision.  However, we don't know what happen within those 6 weeks and never will.  I feel it's best to be honest with oneself, an especially too since he has a little son involved. That's the gist, but check it out for yourself. Don't rely on others opinions.  Enjoy the ride, it was a good one.|`|XEAq2AtMaa	He looked conflicted as he was walking Molly out and when she said you are making a big mistake, he seemed to be internalizing that thought.  I didnt think he would change his mind but i am disappointed that he could be so unsure and propose anyway.  To do that to melissa was really hurtful, better to change his mind now than later but still seems like he doesnt have his act together.  I will be surprised if he and Molly have a succesful lasting relationship.|`|Xl6TnGBOaa	he ditched the winner of his reality show and went back to one of the losers.|`|A8pjB6oxaa	Jason chose mellissa because that was the only way he could get to sleep with her.... of course he already slept with Molly. He then pretended that he couldn't get over Molly and broke up with Mellissa knowing all along what his intentions were. I believe he was also influenced by his family as his isster-in-law had declared Molly the better choice for Jason when they went to visit the family. I heard that Seattle is damp and cold ....but are it's people the same?  Molly has no class apparently as she just jumped back into Jason's arms. That bastard would have to fight really hard to get me back. Clearly she was not his first choice and it probably wont work anyway since jason is an IDIOT!!!|`|192VzAFGaa	Well, he got engaged to her on the season finale, but then on the After The Final Rose show, he broke up with Melissa, and asked Molly for another chance. She accepted, and now they are back together. :)|`|I1wHgJAwaa	he dumped her and went for molly.

It is a source of vitamin C (ascorbic acid), potassium, folic acid (Vitamin B9). Citrus juices also contain flavonoids that are believed to have beneficial health effects. However, if drunk on an empty stomach, orange juice can exacerbate present gastro-intestinal conditions and/or cause mild and temporary stomach upset. Due to the citric acid, orange juice typically has a pH of 3.5. Drinking or sipping orange juice can therefore cause erosion of the tooth enamel, otherwise known as 'acid erosion'. It is recommended to use a straw so that the juice does not come into contact with the teeth. 200 ml (about 7 ounces) of orange juice accounts for 1 of the recommended 5 pieces of fruit a day.|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	not for me cos it gives me migraines but for my family the one that i squeeze fresh from the orange and pour straight into their glasses.... no hidden colors or flavors or preservatives or nastysludgechemicals either to upset sensitive bodies in the real deal ..... the real orange juice that is.<br>  <br>  peace baby<br>  ?|`|9lVjWPGqaa	tropicana<br>  <br>  rtf?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=A0WTc7Banq1JwegALQ7OxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090303131219AA0se7U">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  edwardzslady duh<3|`|uZfg4CEfaa	non-pulp is great. they used to have strawberry/banana/OJ, but i haven't seen it recently...|`|BBVfRheyaa	Valencia.|`|bZwABbpNaa	The orange kind.|`|OnAoyAZFaa	valencia wit mango|`|GzBkproMaa	tropicana with no pulp!
3n2o63Esaa	EP= Extended Play<br>  <br>  When a band makes an album, they record more songs than are actually on the album. When the EP is released, its the songs they didn't put on the album|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	Extended Play. It's essentially a widely released recording that's shorter than an album (also called an LP) but longer than a single.|`|PSY5G9tTaa	Extended Play. It's a sample of music from an artist or band. Shorter than an album, but usually has more than just one track.|`|SApZ3x5waa	Extended play. It is a record of shorter duration than a full album, often containing new material not suited to, or not able to fit on the full album. These are often released as an addendum to the album.

Please don't plant that idea in anyone's head.  I even threw up in my mouth a little!<br>  <br>  The only similarity is black hair.  Adam is no namby-pamby teenage swoonster.  Ugh.<br>  <br>  Ptttt.|`|OBwqjS8maa	He definitely looks like he could be part of the Jonas family.

When did youh join Y!A? o.O'''<br>  <br>  <> Around 2007. But when I first come to YA I became a P&S Reg. I seldom come to C&A that time. I decided to join C&A after answering Tally-wa (Talrimk)’s Q at C&A. She’s the first ever Reg that I met. I know about the ‘C&A Regs’ thingy coz of her :]<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Who were the 1st reg(s) to greet youh?<br>  <br>  <> lol Tally doesn’t even remember me anymore! So I think it’s Stabby. She was so COOL XD Oh, and Miyu too! XD Love you Miyu~! <br>  <br>  <br>  3. Who was the 1st C&A reg(s) youh recognized?<br>  <br>  <> Again, it’s Tally ^^ And after that it’s Chou (fer asking too much Qs), Mizu (I still remember his famous Tsunade avie) & Jazmin! Oh, when I joined C&A Jazmin wasn’t the Top Answerer yet that time. She became the TA like a few months after that. The TA that time was ‘Etaina Seeker of the …?’ (can’t remember >_<). <br>  <br>  <br>  4. Who's polls//surveys//questions were popular?<br>  <br>  <> I can’t remember~! I used to like this old reg’s survey a lot (coz she included other regs in most of her Qs) but… yeah. I can’t remember. Polls & surveys are really rare that time. The best Q asker would be Chou’s, Light’s Kira’s, Tally’s, Jazmin’s, Black-Kun’s, etc~ XDD I love their Qs. Shame they didn’t come here anymore v___v<br>  <br>  5. When was the 1st time youh felt like a "reg"?<br>  <br>  <> Well I used to have this habit of changing my username a lot & it really gives trouble to the regs to recognize meh o only a few old Regs recognize me that time (some of the old Reg recognize me as ‘Neji’ coz that was my username at C&A until I changed it to ‘Bel’). The first time I really felt like a reg was after Chou made a list of all the Regs at C&A. He included my name (and even my former usernames) in the Reg list too & I felt so proud ^///////^ I never expected that actually lol<br>  <br>  6. Did your personality change as time passed in C&A?<br>  <br>  <> Heck jyeahh~ At first I’m so dang nice + sweet to other ppl but after that… >.>””” I became so perverted (blame the regs too fer this!) + annoying. I became somewhat cocky too >__< Mainly coz I’ve been here longer than most of you & it annoys me whenever I see someone that I don’t know at C&A claiming themselves Reg (and using the word ‘C&A Reg’ in their Qs). I was like, ‘What the fudge with you claiming yourself a reg? I don’t even KNOW you! >:P’<br>  <br>  Yeah… it’s like that >.>”””<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Which reg was also new when youh joined?<br>  <br>  <> …….<br>  <br>  I already told you I joined in since 2007… how do you expect me to…… but all I can say is that most the regs that I know that time has already gone. The only (old) regs that are still here now are Chou, Shadow Mist, Darth, Tri, Mizu, Mat, etc~<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  8.

l9uGrfSYaa	Ehh, sorta. <br>  <br>  I don't usually stick with the same anime because I get bored way, way too easily so "true" fans to an anime say that I'm one of those "non-Loyal" fans or "anime Gigilos". How crazy is that?! <br>  <br>  Sorry guys......I just don't like spending money on anime I'm gonna get bored with.....let alone Fave Anime merchandice. Luckily, the anime groups around my area (small town area) are not that dedicated either so Yah........sorry that was a rant. V.V<br>  <br>  Heh, I sort of misread the Q so here is a better answer: <br>  <br>  Other anime friends think I'm dull because I enjoy the older stuff more (from like the late 80's and early 90's). I'm not really into the wacked out new anime because they are all completely the same......same situation, same character persona, same Everything! I'm tired out it! Old School is when these sad stereotypes didn't exist, being original n all! <br>  <br>  >.>...........another rant. Sorry, I'm just tired of being called DULL for watching older anime shows. <br>  <br>  nya<br>  <br>  nya|`|XNIkS3KNaa	Sometimes probably since I like Yaoi and Shounen-ai. :)|`|vqg6wpCLaa	I probably am.<br>  <br>  I could care less though.<br>  <br>  The anime and manga I like are for my own personal preference and if some random kid doesn't like that...what's he going to do? Shoot me because I don't like so and so? Or because I like so and so? <br>  <br>  Seriously, I can't be bothered with them. I understand if someone bashes another if that person is all in their face about the anime, but if they simply say that they like and and are judged, then there is something wrong there. Sigh...|`|POXOqhOYaa	Hey Chu 4 Lyfe. :)<br>  <br>  Yes, I'm judged by other anime fans on a consistent basis on here, and other anime sites and forums because of what I like to watch and my personal preferences. See, I'm no pervert or anything like that but because I enjoy watching Yaoi and Yuri genre anime type shows some people are pretty quick to judge and tend to insult me because of it. Funny enough I'm straight and just because I watch these shows people like to jump down my throat asking me how I can be straight and watch "stuff like that", simply I like the romance. Anyway you'll find that wether it's talking about anime or not people who don't know each other are quick to jump to conclusions about other people or label them in a certain style or stereotype. Of course if you start talking to this person their opinions might change but it's horrid to see people on here asking about genres like Hentai, Yaoi and Yuri because prior to popular belief they are a type of animation and there's no need to answer a question  simply to say "Eww, your digusting" or "SICKO".<br>  <br>  Luckily I don't enjoy labeling and when I'm talking to somebody with a different preference as me, I ask them what they like about it and sometimes we even get talking about completely different things because we just happened to "click", maybe if people gave others a chance there wouldn't be a problem.<br>  <br>  Ohh, sorry for such a long rant! xD<br>  <br>  I hope I helped and have a nice day.<br>  <br>  Later.|`|bRjq7xZ5aa	yeah. if i say i don't like deathnote, i get jumped by 100 other fans. if i say i like naruto, they all blanch and ask what the hell is wrong with me. but it's in human nature to judge, so i don't blame them. as long as they don't interfere with me watching the animes i love, i don't care :/|`|btFSgJmlaa	Not really.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Nope, not really.<br>  <br>  People don't compare me unless they want to die.|`|fwBIXZxPaa	I like mainstream anime's. -__-<br>  <br>  .....<br>  <br>  Most people reading this probably just thought that, "Oh, she's never seen REAL anime."<br>  You just judged me, then. ^_~|`|cidwIuJRaa	I think everyone is.<br>  <br>  <br>  And,you definitely are as well,Mr. Ichigo 100%!|`|UcaxDuLqaa	... no ....not that I know of....<br>  <br>   ...although... I do hate to see it when someone gets attacked on here by asking a question or showing their love for a certain anime...|`|sj3HJ5jZaa	i don't care what they say<br>  what makes naruto so great and i seen and heard of the dumb anime|`|ehF2XiMbaa	Yeeh. People have Naruto issues.|`|2jxWrnUGaa	Nope not really =]|`|nUOw6rOgaa	Yeah.<br>  I can't help it that i like Naruto.....lol.<br>  <3|`|U0FgxEJxaa	No, I don't think so, because the Anime fans I am most in contact with like the same genre (for the most part) as I do.  And, I am starting to branch out, reading/watching other genre than action/adventure and that will bring me into contact with more people.  I respect other fans' opinions and while I may lot like their favorites, I do respect their right and desire to watch and read what they like, as I hope they do mine.|`|DMHJDByvaa	sadly, yes they do. my classmates consider our group (we have an anime lover group at school) extremely weird... to the point that they even in half part on the halls when we pass by! no exaggerating! <br>  <br>  especially when they found out that i like junjou romantika, which is a yaoi manga and anime. they all told me i was disgusting but i told them to back off and mess with their own lives. (i was brave.. XD)<br>  <br>  just because i read and watch watch yaoi doesn't mean i'm a pervert. i just have my own interest.|`|pTERJdzQaa	Yes, of course, I like Naruto, I am a Avid Naruto Fanatic, and I still get called a Narutard!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  And, I love pokemon to, and I get called things like  Pokefreak, and Pokemon Junkie, and other stuff like that.<br>  <br>  Do you remember this?: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvrCsCxnrt9WHOR5iWAlAjzty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219152822AAX2fQ3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|eFrJPSJOaa	CHU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *hugs*<br>  <br>  no....... maybe..... ok i am sometimes.... but i cant help but watch powerpuff girls most of the time....

X45rxI7gaa	Bad anime, Michael Bay is the embodiment of stupidity. If his movies didn't have big names of stars or franchises he'd be filming porn.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  I've hated Bay long before Bayformers so don't bother trivializing, <br>  <br>  Bad Boys<br>  Pearl Harbor<br>  The Rock<br>  <br>  ALL were terrible movies, and this guy clearly has no knowledge on guns and missiles and tanks, military in general. Moreover his movies have no acts, they're plotless and contain 1 set piece after another. Plus always shakes the camera you don't see what goes on.
HPqqgtOSaa	Really pissed off because after years of waiting she finally confesses her love for Naruto and then gets killed off so simply like this? And besides i don't want to see any Konoha 11 get killed off cause their supposed to be the next generation, they can kill off guys like Ebisu and those useless characters for all i care.|`|eFrJPSJOaa	OMG IM GONNA CRY!!!!!!!!!!! ....the poor little hinata ish dead.... T.T<br>  <br>  <br>  ....not really... i dont care for hinata too much... lol<br>  <br>  BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *hugs*<br>  ....*and hugs chu just for fun* lol|`|uv16sS0daa	I soooo hope she's not dead. <br>  That's the problem with Kishimoto, he never makes deaths clear.<br>  Neji better come back and kick some @$$.|`|BeLxE4iWaa	Neji's goinn ta kick some ***|`|Hiasgb75aa	I'd feel... normal|`|4UeOIGuhaa	I have no feelings about Hinata dying. <br>  <br>  But it was dramatic lmao|`|dpAD1KoEaa	i'm not in shock... authors always do that crap... I am one so I knew  it would come up. in truth I keep saying i'm gonna sue but I don't mean it... thats just personal feelings taking over... like all good authors I get way too attached to characters. i'm sure that naruto's author is half destroyed after killing off kakashi and so hinata is more than likely fine. but if not then the series is no longer worth reading.|`|hzH75VDXaa	To tell you the truth, I may stop reading Naruto for a while.<br>  I would really be hurt that after revealing her true feelings, for it to end like that....<br>  Curiosity would eventually get the better of me, but I wouldn't read it for a while.<br>  <br>  I don't think she's dead though.|`|HhpRxYSLaa	Then NaruHina won't happen, and NaruSaku will.<br>  <br>  I really wouldn't care.|`|IwNlBlP3aa	I feel that naruto and sakura will have no prob in their relationship..

Heather is the daughter of Paul. Paul once gave Nikki an STD. <br>  <br>  My guess? It could be something in the jeans (genes).|`|bnSLRVUMaa	the doctor hasnt said any reply to him. i think he picked it up in Mexico... they could kill him off that way.|`|AA11369432	Gosh, It could be any thing...He looks like he does not shower.

Some Scorpios immediately attempt to hurt their ex-partner. Others take their revenge in more subtle ways over a period of time.

From there, I looked up all those bands, and then I did the same thing for all the others I have come across.  When you learn about it that way you really get a wider view of everything and you can fully understand where the music came from.|`|rjeqfoKNaa	It's hard to say because "punk" is such a varied term. You have people whose idea of punk is My Chemical Romance and people whose idea of punk is Tragedy, and everything in between and sideways and whatever. I have no idea what you currently listen to or consider punk. But I agree with Sam that, if you haven't listened to them before, you need to listen to Crass.|`|NopTr18taa	well it depends. There are different types of punk out there and I don't know what you like thus far.<br>  <br>   Dead Kennedy's, Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Ramones, Misfits, maybe some SamHain... NOFX, Rise Against, Anti-Flag, Rancid, Black Flag, Regan Youth, Ghostie Ghoulies, Tsunami Bomb (hard to find, but VERY good) <br>  <br>  Those are just random bands.. try the ones you haven't heard of then go from there. :)|`|EYQnHEVxaa	Holy christ I love the Cramps.

Niygpxktaa	I've heard it said the Lionel Richie was like Michael Jackson before there was a Michael Jackson, in terms of his mass appeal.<br>  <br>  However, when you compare their catalogues<br>  and given that you included songwriting and producing as well as performing, you have to give it to Babyface.<br>  <br>  Babyface was omnipresent on R&B radio during much of the 90's.<br>  You couldn't  go 15 minutes without hearing something he  had touched. <br>  <br>  Although his songs sometimes bordered on the sappy to me, I have nothing but respect for his immense talent.|`|XMRjYkgSaa	this hard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i would have to say lionel riche. "loveconquers all" love will find a way" "hello" great songz man. i like babyface also. but lionel took the cake.|`|8zyu6FWpaa	Gonna have to go with Babyface cuz he's talented and seems to be a pretty nice guy. <br>  <br>  But can I add a write-in vote for Al Green?  :)|`|xplSmeCYaa	Babyface all the way.|`|Uzg09g2laa	babyface for sure!  he was even HOTTER when he came out with "tender lover" (album).|`|FdNYv4D9aa	I didn't care for Babyface too much past 1992, as his sound began to sound TOO simulated with the rest of the "stuff" out in urban music...but Babyface in the 80s was FIRE! His sound/beat/production was immensely infectious and was GENIUS.<br>  <br>  With that said, it's why I have to go with Lionel in the 80s, as his catalogue of hits and his sound was highly amazing and crafty!|`|4SDqRs6Laa	I agree that Babyface's songs are sometimes pretty cheesy, but I too have nothing but respect for his immense talent. However, you cannot mess with the classics. I do love em both, but I'm gonna have to go with LIONE RICHIE :)|`|BQ6yIRFUaa	Babyface so talented|`|xmdh8iY3aa	Babyface is one of my fav artists so I have to choose him. Not only did he have his own hit records he signed and produced mega artists like TLC, Donell Jones and Toni Braxton  with his partner L.A. Reid. He also wrote hundreds of hit songs for it seems like everyone - from Boyz II Men to Jon B, to his brothers After 7. <br>  <br>  Its between Babyface and R. Kelly for king of 90's r&b. Lionel just didn't have that same influence in the 80's. A great artist in his own right........I still jam to Dancing on the Ceiling. And I love his work with the Commodores.

hZVJRW7uaa	I used to love waking up to watch "The Lion Kings: Timon and Pumbaa" cartoon series.<br>  <br>  Disney channel is only in for the money. As a lot of companies, but good channels like Cartoon Network actually cater to the kids.<br>  <br>  I hate all that pop star, music and celebrity singing crap. All this High School Musical, Hannah Montana, Jonas Brothers, Camp Rock..<br>  WHO CARES ABOUT A BUNCH OF FICTIONAL TEENS WHO CAN'T SING FOR THEIR SOULS?<br>  <br>  Sadly, the only thing that will shut down disney is a giant lawsuit. I'll support you all the way.|`|429770cb7e87248aee142afd2cf077ffaa	Yeah, it's become 100% corporate driven & processed crap. <br>  <br>  Everything that I remember being great about disney in general when I was a kid, is gone. The cartoons like talespin and darkwing duck, the big feature length animated movies they put out every summer,etc....I don't even go to Disneyland anymore cause it's lost all it's magic/appeal.<br>  <br>  They've turned their channel/shows into 24/7 self-promotion/propaganda, and it makes me sick to my stomach how kids are eating this stuff up.|`|AA12261667	i totally agree 100%<br>  disney shouldn't shut down tho...<br>  they should just bring back all the good shows that actually teach kids something.|`|AA10479574	I like the Jonas Brothers personally but maybe because I am a kid at heart. I do think I tend to act like Im 16 at times.<br>  I do agree that the Disney Channel is not as good. I mean even the Jonas Brothers song lyrics arent as good as they were before Disney discovered them and over the years something about them personally changed its like Disney Channel is trying to brainwash them and tell them to be a certain way.<br>  They also had to go and cancel Phil of the Future on a cliffhanger (best show on Disney Channel...could go without the sound effects but thats just Disney Channel for ya) PISSED about that and apparently it was because Raviv (the one who plays Phil) did Driftwood, a rated R movie so they fired him. how stupid is that? its just a dang movie.<br>  <br>  can you really hate the actors? you dont personally know them. I do not think you really hate any of the actors. they are human beings too you cant hate them its just Disney Channel that you hate. <br>  <br>  However, shows like Hannah Montana and Sunny with a Chance are targeted mainly for kids and thats just what kids like these days. you cant question it. I mean at least its wholesome. If kids think its funny (and a few adults who are kids at heart) you have to respect that.|`|HEAAooaWaa	I agree with you, years ago Disney meant something but I guess with everything it had to move on. Disney needs to make money somehow and nobodies gonna tune in if it's just old stuff. The times have changed since you and I watched disney channel. Same with Playhouse Disney, I remember when it had presenters, Big Dave and Little Alex, but I guess they had to make cutbacks and presenters had to go. Disney now is OK, but yes, it has changed a lot.|`|hsVVgUgMaa	I know all they show is crap i miss the good things to (love love love Lion King and Pinocchio btw) Hanna Montannah, Sunny with a Chance are boring and the suck. My 5 year old cousin hates them and she 5 years old. They really need to go back to showing the good stuff or just not show anything at all. I cant take the actors because they cant even act anyways the should just shut down|`|HO2S5wkHaa	I agree with you. I dont like what they made disney to be. Its not good at all anymore. I dont get what the point of those shows they show now are about they sucks.|`|O19RNngmaa	I only like that "suite life on deck" show cuz its cute.  But almost everything SUCKS!!! I mean, half the actor/actresses r such bad influences on the little kids watching!|`|dfjIBHe3aa	Calm down please.  When I was your age the Vietnam War was on and there were certain truisms which haven't gone away although people deny them.  One is you can't trust the Establishment.  Another is that Disney, Inc. is one of the biggest Mercenaries out there.  Over time, of course, we've had Watergate, the lies of Ronald Raygunz and the destruction of career paths for most of a generation nearing retirement (hah), Bush acts 1 and 2 and Disney has gotten MORE mercenary, not less.  They believe that tweens -- the audience you have just grown out of -- is exclusively the audience they want (as opposed to when I or my decade older siblings were young when the tweens were part of an INCLUSIVE family focus and  we could watch the Hardy Boys or the latest Tommy Kirk or Kurt Russell movie AS A FAMILY).  The Magic Kingdom has always had a dark side, and you are just seeing it more openly than we ever had to.<br>  <br>  I pity you.  One of the refuges open to me was Underground comics -- sex drugs and heavy doses of Marxist Ideology and socialist indoctrination in comic book form.  I was only ever a Marxist for two weeks after a particularly unfortunate exposure to the Empire Strikes Back, but I really dug Trashman of the Sixth International as much for the Trotskyism as the violence or women.<br>  <br>  It's easy to cuss out Disney.  Very easy.  That won't change anything though.  Move on.  There's nothing to look at here.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you liked the Lion King try finding the OLD anime Kimba the White Lion on youtube or something.  Disney always denied --publicly it was based on it, but most of us believe that was to avoid paying royalties.  There is a brief account on the Wikipedia's Lion King page under Controversy, and frankly, some of us, who generally enjoy Disney stuff, think Kimba was MUCH better.|`|MTr4dy3naa	I love Disney.<br>  I like the way it is now, but I still miss other old cartoons.<br>  <br>  Opinion of others...<br>  Disney Channel: more for girls<br>  Disney XD: more for boys<br>  Toon Disney: shut down<br>  <br>  Theu should make a Disney Classics channel.

Did you have something great happen to you yesterday?  Or did she have a bad day?<br>  <br>  Sure, go ahead and trade for a day. I won't tell.|`|4WCLWhaTaa	Virtually? Absolutely possible. <br>  Physically? Possible but requiring much more work than most P&Sers could ever be asked to do :)
ulBW2m62aa	Maybe it's because Chris said he'd beat her up again if she diddn't want him back.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	why does it concern you at all in the first place?|`|HmCAPy41aa	Because love makes you stupid. It is very sad but a high percentage of abuse victims forgive their attacker. People want to believe "I'm sorry and I would never do that again"<br>  <br>  Many people are thrilled that they are back together again. <br>  They have been leaving comments on my articled here<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1524420/chris_brown_back_together_again_siegfried.html?cat=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  and <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1496177/photo_of_rihannas_beaten_face_leaked.html?cat=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  Some people have had the nerve to say she deserved it. That's just sick!|`|sm0COFLTaa	Who knows...I hear it's quite common for abused women to keep going back to their abuser.<br>  I'm sure he has pulled out all the stops in trying to convince her it won't happen again - but most likely it will happen again.|`|6eonpX8Qaa	'cause she's an idiot<br>  i thought everyone already knew that:||`|8q5SeYueaa	She's just a human, weak to her boyfriend's apologies, like so many women. It's sad.. I just hope she finds strength|`|MNBGRi0Gaa	Everyone is always saying someone is an idiot in these types of situation for being a forgiving person. But the real idiots are the people that have negative things to say without knowing the whole truth or the parties involved. Bottom line is Rihanna has gotten to know Chris Brown on a level none you ever will, unless your just that lucky.

SXwlw9N2aa	LOL..Yes it finally did come out that he had the vasectomy's reversed. I think the writers had forgot about them and that was their answer when the viewers started questioning about how could Sabrina get pregnant. I figured being the brat that Abby has became, that she would have thrown a fit about a baby sister or brother. Wonder how fast they will age this baby lol. And did you see the look on Victoria's face? She isn't happy about the news at all.|`|vqUVWPBAaa	He told Katherine at his wedding to Sabrina that he "quietly" had it reversed. Ashley was told when she lost Brad's son (Robert) after that horrible car accident that she could not have anymore children. Ashley went off the deep end again, after that happen. I really would like to know how the writers are going to spin this one. Surely, I am not the only viewer to remember that she cannot have anymore children.|`|17d2bf173d4736ad8ae99a2e1672a131aa	yep and they need to check their stuff before writing uncoherent lines... tired of that! Anyway Victor needs to go away and other people need to be the focus of the story line... Neal seem to have no life except from the women around him fighting for a man that is just following whoever comes!|`|4kuWOZowaa	The writers must not have a memory...lol|`|LTsmr0SPaa	I don't know, but the surgeons there are getting paid a fortune for lousy work, aren't they? Maybe he made deposits in several sperm banks so he'd be able to be the only male in the gene pool there.|`|3xOKvjzDaa	he got them reversed they said. lol. you know guys can have babies no matter how old they are. its the women who cant have babies after a certain age when they hit menopause. but after two reversed vasectomys they are pushing it a bit|`|AA10821695	Well, like everyone else, he did have it reversed. But like one 'answerer' said, Ashley is pushing the baby-having threshold!|`|7912f79fee900d73d9e2592b682e2b28aa	just the last thing gc needs-another victor spawn! he's as bad as sonny corinthos on gh!<br>  and,uh,isnt old vic like,over 60?i think its time he stop making babies and just enjoy the children that hes got.|`|AA11666374	This is Genoa City.....thye dont have any real Drs. Just people acting like Drs. So no wonder Victor has all these babies. So why isnt he on Maury Povich?|`|hRykRgWBaa	I guess so. At least this time, Ashley doesn't have to steal nothing.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	i know,,ain't it wild hes having another child,i think he had his vasectomy reversed so he can have kids again..hes got more kids than any other man in town,,what about kevin,,wonder how hes going to get away? and Mrs.C is left in the room when the bomb goes off,it is getting so good,,cant wait till monday,,|`|AA11369432	He had a reversal...But he need to stop it . He's too old. Grandchildren   older than his children.
mSt1LGfjaa	oh hell yeah i agree with you 100 %,,she makes me sick too,she is going nuts,i hope Phylis's catches her and beats the heck out of her,watch her get pregnant and wont know if its Billy's or Nicks,,|`|xQn3rR6Naa	I think they are going to give her a brain tumor and then she will be pregnant and not recall who the father is.|`|17d2bf173d4736ad8ae99a2e1672a131aa	no she is the easy hole to score!!! sorry for the expression...<br>  she will leave soon if they can';t find a way to fix herself!!!|`|msUIsv8maa	Looks that way lol|`|EzZk2pyNaa	lol I like Sharon.|`|eHyJ9mYFaa	I wonder if she is the younger sister of Brooke on B&B|`|SXwlw9N2aa	Oh I know it, she makes me sick too. But what is killing me right now is how Nick is acting over her. He tells Phyllis one thing, then runs as fast as he gets the chance to Sharon. I think both of these women need to tell Nick to take a hike. He is acting like a dog. I am very disappointed with his actions.|`|AA10821695	Do I detect a note of jealousy???? Just kidding!!!!!<br>  <br>  I still like Sharon, and she's been through a rough time, and her past is catching up with her, and she feels as if there is no one to understand her predicaments, so she is still having a mental breakdown!|`|hRykRgWBaa	lol, i agree completly. and she's turned into a klepto as well. i think she's going to get pregnant and it's either going to be nick's or billy's.|`|7912f79fee900d73d9e2592b682e2b28aa	you said it! its like shes a whore giving free services to all the men in town! first nick,then billy,now nick again! i cant wait till phyliss gets busy with adam! that'll show nick for all his cheating!|`|AA11666374	Sharon cant help but be charmed by a Newman.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Its not Gold..lol just proof that she OPENS them to EASY..lol
wA8Dyhq7aa	U2.<br>  <br>  WHY:  As a veteran, I find Hendrix's "performance" of our National Anthem degrading to the song and our country.|`|71SjVwWNaa	hendrix - for one for the time of 1969 nothing has ever been done like that before, improvisations were far beyond the normal and he absolutely nailed the star spangled banner. He was heading into a unknown improvisation territory that musicians has never gone into before, that solo of the star spangled banner is considered an icon of Woodstock 69' and an icon of the whole 60's era|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Hendrix' Star Spangled Banner, while an icon of the Woodstock generation, doesn't do *nearly* as much for *me* as U2's Bullet the Blue Sky...<br>  <br>  I just *love* Edge's playing!|`|89xzNpVaaa	Both, trust me, Hendrix fans will say Hendrix and U2 fans will choose the first one, even those who did not listen to any of them.|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	The Edge couldn't hold Hendrix's jock.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hendrix all the way.|`|URO3gDXcaa	hendrix.  no need to explain.|`|qx4F2SJmaa	U2 but they were great in the 80's 90's now they are all politically correct sell outs.  They only do things FOR Africa, never for America they are just a bunch of talented losers.|`|laTJCHKqaa	def u2, and this song is one of their best|`|KvkhUbcBaa	Hendrix had more talent in his little toe than all of U2 together.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jimi hands down.|`|AA11346983	star spangled banner. why, you ask? because jimi hendrix>U2|`|AA11081398	Hands down U2.

irSBrZiQaa	Well technically they are not a couple. Natalia has no idea that Olivia feels that way about her. I am not sure where they are going with this storyline, but hopefully they will remain friends. I personally want to see Natalia with Frank.<br>  <br>  Here is a brief recap of all the characters that are on right now. I will be as short and descriptive as possible :)<br>  <br>  Reva/Jeffery/Shayne and Josh....Reva used to be married to Josh Lewis, they have been lovers and friends for many many years. Their last divorce was because of her cancer and then the fact that Josh was with her sister Cassie. Cassie is now living in Hawaii after her divorce from Josh. Reva and Josh have both made some mistakes, but they are good friends. Before Reva married Jeffery, Josh wanted her back, but she decided to stay with Jeffery. Reva just finished up her last round of Chemo(sp?) and they are hoping that she will survive the cancer. Jeffery and her have been having problems lately, but mostly because Jeffry is scared to loose Reva. Reva and Josh have 2 kids Shayne and Marah. Shayne just came back, Shayne used to date Marina and Marah used to date Jeffery(Reva's now husband). <br>  <br>  Dinah/Mallet/Marina...Mallet and Dinah used to be married before she had a brain injury and that kind of ruined them. Mallet just married Marina which is Harley's niece and was also married to Mallet. Mallet is now more desperate to get a baby for Marina because of the death of Coop. Mallet and Dinah were able to get a baby from another country, but only time will tell how that will work. See Shayne's girlfriend was pregnant when she died, so I am thinking that the baby that Mallet just adopted will turn out to be Shayne's baby, but that is just my opinion.<br>  <br>  Lizzie/Bill/Cyrus and Grady...Lizzie was kidnapped by Grady, but in an attempt to blame it on Bill, Grady came up with a plan with Alan to plant evidence on Bill while he was in a coma. Then Cyrus got in on it and made Lizzie believe that Bill did it. Now that Bill knows the truth, they kidnapped him to keep him quiet, however Lizzie now knows that Grady did it.<br>  <br>  Buzz is still angry with Alan for Coop's death because Coop was having an affair with Alan's girlfriend Beth. Well when Alan found out he forced Beth to marry him, but Coop wanted to stop it. On his way to the church Alan called Coop and told him that he would never touch Beth again. Coop lost control of the car. Before the car exploded Phillip rescued him, but later Coop's injuries would force Buzz to make the choice to pull his life support. <br>  <br>  Alan is a creep and you will soon find that out. He has done way to much to try and list here. Phillip just returned after being shot and stashed away by Alan. Phillip went crazy a while back and Alan thought it would be a good idea to keep him out of town.<br>  <br>  Olivia was dieing of a heart problem. Gus Natalia's ex-husband was their to help her all the way. One day on his way to the hospital he had a crash and died. Olivia now has Gus's heart. <br>  <br>  I know I am leaving stuff out, but I think this will help you a bit.|`|bnSLRVUMaa	No there is not. also here is the scoop:<br>  recently Cooper died and he is Buz's son.  Reva and Josh have always been in love but now Reva is with someone else. she has Cancer by the way. Allen had something to do with the death. Lizzie's dad philip is out of jail now!!!|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Olivia and Natalia moved in together because Olivia had heart transplant surgery and needed some help.  Natalia was having financial trouble making her house payments, so they stayed together to help each other out and they are both very involved in Olivia's daughter's life (she is 5) and her name is Emma.<br>  <br>  One day at school, Emma had written a story and presented it to the class and some parents.  It was called My Two Mommies.  It was just an innocent story about how good they take care of her at home.  But some people took it the wrong way and think that Olivia and Natalia are lovers.  They are not.  However, Olivia has begun to develop some feelings for Natalia.  Natalia has been dating Frank.<br>  <br>  I kinda hope they don't take the storyline in that direction either.  I would rather see Natalia and Frank together.  Frank could really use a good woman in his life right now...|`|AA10093245	Yes there is. <br>  the "my two moms" storyline is being played out.<br>  Natalia is still not catching on, but she's in for a surprise.

eNE5Q25taa	Awh jeez it's a bit of ice cream, people work hard to make money so if they want ice cream let them have ice cream. =)<br>  I'm in Ireland and there's no such thing as ice cream being "illegal" here.<br>  "how f'ing SELFISH and UNCARING for the needs of others is sitting and eating a bowl of ice cream these days? (especially spending money on this)" <----- well then you've really got to change your display picture havent you? and your using the internet right now which is costing you money?|`|wmBK9uASaa	It should be made free to all,|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Thatcher introduced a way of making ice cream go around a bit farther in her days as a chemist, by filling it with air. It was cold air of course, unlike the hot air she was full of, but it is all food for thought.|`|lFqUMMAGaa	A second bowl of ice cream ;-)<br>  I do not feel eating a bowl of ice cream is a crime ~ I see what you are saying about all the sadness in the world ~ but not eating ice cream is not going to solve the worlds problems ~ If I thought for a minute it would help I would never eat ice cream again ~ <br>  I am from The Isle of Man ~ where it is legal to eat ice cream ~|`|G8zAPz8Maa	hmmm <br>  You are correct - I declare VAT on ice cream will be increased to 700% and you will need a special licence to store it in your home. This will cost ￡10,000<br>  and I will upgrade it to a class C drug|`|KVzBqWhvaa	Well I get free ice cream because I work at an ice cream shop hehe.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Uhmmm....we eat ice cream to forget about money? lol<br>  But, maybe Y!A should be illegal....you could be working xD|`|ed6035b7b3f0fa8bd08fcb09d185562aaa	If we made it illegal we'd be putting millions of ice cream factory worjers, truck drivers, and shop clerks out of business. Don't you think putting them in the streets is selfish and UNCARING too?|`|S71QyFPgaa	Wierdo!!!|`|lPgwZzoWaa	If it wasn't for ice cream, life would be unworth living!!  And I KNOW suicide is illegal, so I will stick with ice cream!|`|klhFMdCgaa	have you never heard of the Break Up ritual? Eat lots of ice cream while stewing in your own self-pity. People need ice cream to make them feel better!|`|G2gf2ZJyaa	well it is ice cream it cant kill you<br>  <br>   i live in the uk|`|X7DDlR1caa	in that case.. it should be illegal to have your display pic :)|`|odKmX3qbaa	it wouldnt surprise me if thats next on the agenda|`|fce6b20339c75fb9fb439e1ea485621aaa	I scream,you...NOT,we all SCREAM for ICE CREAM!!! :)|`|3J0utfJXaa	i understand the delemma but nevertheless we should be able to buy ICE CREAM!! i give money to the poor, geez you act like everyone's a selfish bastard|`|nmzafTVFaa	ok i get your point but shouldnt we try one cause for two results?<br>  like smoking. if smokind was illegal we'd all be much healthier and less $$ would be spent.<br>  .... couldnt you say buying anything would be selfish then?|`|NtAuguxEaa	If they couldn't afford it, then they wouldn't buy it...<br>  <br>  ICECREAM FOR ALL x]|`|GFvcoK2Uaa	ooo yeah totally selfish. *rolls eyes*|`|aBwQ06A6aa	No ice cream,  u on crack or somethin? y r u even asking this!??!? frozen desserts r a thing that gives me comfort!

gIjnoEi5aa	From what I understand, Ken Warwick, Idol's executive producer, will allow the judges to bring back about 9-10 of their favorites from the previous 27 semi-finalists on March 5. Each wild card contestant will perform and then the judges will choose the three best to complete the top 12. So if your fave contestant has already gone home there's still a chance he or she can come back to the competition.|`|M9LB94FHaa	remaining 27 i believe...but not sure how many they're picking..i thought 3 but idk!
DUg1IkTIaa	No, I don't think so.  Being patient is learned, and a lot of today's children don't know how to wait for anything.  Like the old adage ... good thinks come to those who wait.  I believe that, for sure.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	Yes!<br>  <br>  Sorry short, gotta go, in a BIG hurry!|`|0F8hauikaa	No. Just for examples, I believe that many auto accidents are caused from impatience and people who are impatient to get married often end up divorced as a consequence of their haste.|`|4WCLWhaTaa	I have a very indepth answer but am a little busy right now so you will have to wait and see what it is...|`|vpmRRamKaa	it kind of is<br>  because if your patient<br>  more people will have more respect for you<br>  and patience really is a virtue|`|GeyFdO5jaa	No--Patience is a virtue|`|A8nHjEzmaa	no it probably isn't.  Through it comes wisdom and the ability to overcome.  Generally when you can be patient you end up making the best choices and getting the best results.|`|DFwvcUnhaa	No. Patience is a virtue. Quite rare these days with instant everything. The people that think it is overrated are selfish, self-centered, or ignorant. Its a form of self-control and doesn't come naturally.|`|64cUxJn1aa	Nope. It really is a freakin Virtue.|`|qSnxHinzaa	yes i hate it im not very patient|`|9F6hdc3waa	not reli|`|T6zwrzsoaa	patience can wait!|`|lawMUua3aa	yes|`|wzNABeYZaa	yes|`|bQCfOftxaa	absolutely not. patience can earn you respect and improve your reputation.  isn't it worth biting your tongue or waiting the extra ten minutes for something, keeping your integrity, than being known as a hot-head?  <br>  but remember if you wish for more patience...don't be surprised if you are confronted with endless "opportunities" to practice it!|`|Nipbluclaa	I dont know,<br>  But what i do know is that im not patient :D|`|YOUbbReaaa	Patience is a virtue!|`|0nUzzm0naa	no, it's called nice. :)
FIWB7Dgtaa	beauty is in the eye of the beholder...|`|cjknXzm9aa	it's a matter of perception.

I think she's pretty.|`|fe144337443e16a54a276fa672d87b60aa	Because there are a bunch of haterz in the world. And i bet it's females calling her ugly. Catty jealous azz females because no man in his right mind would call Ashanti ugly unless he's gay.|`|aMlWMkO5aa	I never heard anyone call her ugly, she's pretty...she has put on some weight though...|`|2srNuaIAaa	i think she's not ugly......<br>  she's pretty..<br>  they're jealous to her.<br>  hahahaa|`|947f4523822b8ab2652a16c0a6cd278aaa	she is beautiful to me. but i have a friend who thinks that she looks like a cat|`|fIEmi84Laa	That's because she is.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	because she is, just because she is a "singer" doesn't make her pretty automatically, she's just not that attractive but like she cares, she's Ashanti!
XQKccNWtaa	Anyone in the spotlight will have haters. I think most recently her whole "Sasha Fierce" persona has annoyed people. I never understood the alter-ego thing.|`|QUaKca1Caa	Because they are dumb.<br>  <br>  Shes a very respectable celebrity. Great job. Great music. Awards out the butt. Great husband. No naked pictures.|`|HI9jZSObaa	because beyonce thinks that she is better than everyone else thats why she always tried to outshine the other girls in destinys child. she always thought she was the best singer and she deff is not.|`|FkJobxmGaa	personally beyonce is a modern day dianna ross (from the supremes) her talent is flawless however because of her stardom there will be alot of haters who can't appreciate that|`|KyuT0pPBaa	ppl be hatin of beyonce cause they is stupiid<br>  <br>  ps: keri hilson is the bomb!!|`|E4hJeq4eaa	people are jealous of her|`|feb7143192e9c7ccb1a8b16f5fcd9677aa	no one is hating on her<br>  i just think she's over played<br>  & keri is better than her in my opinion|`|kGkUG0fKaa	I just feel that beyonce is overrated. I don't hate on her, she's a pretty chick wit great style but her music makes me want to punch her in the throat! she can't act...my god she is horrible, she just needs to stick to acting............please!|`|1vaqtRI2aa	I agree with the person above, I find her extremely overrated. I mean, I like her and songs (they're so catchy!), but  I just don't find her very talented. Her clothes are also horrible, and again, like the woman said, she needs to stop acting.|`|2040myy2aa	i was thinking the same thing but Beyonce is on top of her game always so that has to be why and in that song she dissed ciara too smh not a good idea for her being that people are just starting to like her|`|R3XWitoEaa	Because they feel that she caused the whole destiny child intial celebration and because she is beautiful, people just wtend to hate on beautiful people|`|aMlWMkO5aa	I agree, jealousy.

It's got romance here and there and chrono is just so cute. You'll deffinetly cry more then once.  Although it's only 23 episodes it's deffinetly worth it.|`|fKcr6KU0aa	LOL.  Gravitation and Fake are really good, but are shounen-ai anime (Boy's Love).  So if you aren't into gay romance, they may not be your thing.  I really do rec Gravitation, though (it's really cute and very dramatic and funny in parts), and if you are into shounen-ai, Loveless is also good.<br>  <br>  Check out Fushigi Yuugi!  (Also spelled: Fushigi Yugi.)  It's an anime about a girl who falls into a book about ancient China.  Romance, action, fighting, supernatural, humor...it's got all of the above.  And it'll make you cry, too.<br>  <br>  If you like magical girl anime, then Sailor Moon.  It's not something most people think of, but in the subbed version, the end of the first season was really sad and almost made me cry.  And there's action and humor and definitely romance.<br>  <br>  Also Wedding Peach, and Cardcaptor Sakura.  Cardcaptor Sakura is adorable and magical and includes romance, especially in the second (third?) season.<br>  <br>  Also Pretear - it's a sort of a "snow white" type anime, with a lot of guys.<br>  <br>  Shugo Chara! has a lot of the same look and feel as Full Moon, IMHO.  I didn't watch enough to see if it'd make you cry like Full Moon, though.<br>  <br>  Princess Tutu is awesome...it's about a duck who turns into a girl who is trying to collect the shattered pieces of the prince's heart.  Does have some romance, but it's pretty subtle (at least till the end).  ...kind of sad/depressing/dark in parts.  Really classy.<br>  <br>  Gakuen Alice is a lot of fun (about a school with kids with ESP powers), and I THINK it includes romance?  Haven't watched far enough to say for sure.<br>  <br>  Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne is an anime about a magical (female) thief, and is by the same creator as Full Moon.  It's older, though.  Does involve romance.<br>  <br>  D. N. Angel is about a boy who is possessed by the legendary thief Dark Mousy.  He's got a crush on one of a set of red-headed twins, and the other twin has a crush on him.  It's really cute.  Lots of action, too.<br>  <br>  For regular non-magical non-action romance anime:<br>  Skip Beat (involves singing/show biz! you may like this if you liked Full Moon)<br>  Bokura ga Ita<br>  Marmalade Boy<br>  Peach Girl<br>  Boys Over Flowers (Hana Yori Dango)<br>  Lovely Complex<br>  Kodocha (kind of.  It's more humor)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|sjAmS807aa	fake.<br>  <br>  gravitation :D

AA10859773	The first night I couldn't stand that they had parents on.  Who cares?  Show us the parents - if at all - of the FINALISTS.<br>  <br>  I would prefer to see EVERYONE before voting people off.  But perhaps with so darned many people this year that would just be too much.  I don't know.<br>  <br>  I'd also rather not see bios until we get to the finalists.  Why care about someone I'll never see again?|`|VEXKm1Obaa	Ive hated that show from the very begining.|`|rHrr7zmVaa	Can you imagine if they would follow the old system wherein they have to eliminate 4 contestants each week, imagine how slow would it be? I think it's faster this way, don't worry it'll be back to normal once the top 12 will be formed.|`|qnQi1tonaa	It's too long, I like the other format better. They do have some really good singers this year. The competition is stiff!!|`|js8jdNgiaa	i only watch the first auditions. i dont like the voting rounds. its pretty annoying to me.|`|6J2kJHgSaa	I don't like any format of American Idol. It doesn't matter if you can sing well if you're just going to sing crap.|`|zzXiWd7Taa	I HATE the new format! <br>  <br>  But it's not because i think it's too slow - I think it's WAY too fast. It's absolutely ridiculous the way they pick each person in the top 12 based off of only one performance. None of them are even truly part of the "top 12" because they're only getting picked out of one third of the entire top 36. Last year was insanely better. They picked a top 24 and their top 12 was based off of 3 performances, so the 12 were actually people that America liked and voted for continually and not just once! This way is extremely dumb.<br>  <br>  I think if this year was the format of last year, I'm pretty sure everyone would get sick of Lambert's disgusting falsetto & he wouldn't have a chance in hell at top 12. <br>  <br>  If you couldn't tell, I'm a little bitter at him making it. Norman was a genius. :]|`|0Gf1Biu2aa	Yeah..lol I just posted this same thing! It's horribly boring!

"Or any young lady that I might see walking past me that's getting my attention. She got it going on! I'm going crazy over her. I might go to the club and make it rain ... in the club on her because she got it going on." <br>  -Flo Rida|`|k84CYU1caa	The actual song is called Right Round.<br>  Uh, well...<br>  somewhere other than the lyrics where it talks about "spin my head right round" it mentions things about...uhhh *coughpoledancingcough*...why don't you check out the lyrics yourself?

Only buy food that is on discount or on sale and stock up on those items like cereal or can goods that have a long shelf life.  When you need to change a light bulb put in energy efficient ones. They are a little bit more money, but last a lot longer and will reduce your energy bill.  Turn off lights when you are not in the room.  Use a microwave oven whenever possible.  Take shorter showers.  Walk or bike ride places that are close to your house(you save money and get your exercise in) Cut back on cable, speed of the internet, or options on your cell phone.  Do your laundry in cold water and put only full loads in.  Unplug electrical devices when they are not in use, like your television and computer.  There are many more, but that is all I can think of at the moment.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	Open a savings account and do direct deposit.

We all need a little time to relax and have someone else cook.|`|BO28Mn8haa	right now yeah. ugh. my advice, do weekly shopping and stock up on cheap food items instead of picking up dollar menu items at the fast food restaurants. it lasts longer, ends up being cheaper, and is healthier for you. for example, bread, ham and cheese will cost like 8 bucks and it will last you for at least a week's worth of lunch versus a meal at.. lets say Wendys.. which would be about 6 bucks.. times 5 days a week $30 a week. you can save about 88 bucks or so per month just on your lunch. then you can do the same for breakfast and dinner|`|222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	Don't spend...<br>  <br>  Earn more...<br>  <br>  That's all I have.|`|zlQo7WMoaa	I'm a tramp.

It does cost more initially, but I end up saving more because I don't have to replace cheap stuff so often.<br>  After you have what you need, just spend carefully. Keep track of what you spend and see where you can save.<br>  Just remember that it is vitally important to treat yourself nicely every once in a while, after all you do deserve it. Just do it within your means, and keep saving.

XZi4UJgGaa	I'm thinking the same thing. Only one relationship has lasted. People raise these people up to be perfect and good when no one is perfect. Then when the relationship doesn't work on tv, their world is shattered. Plus, how realistic is it to be dating 20 people on fantasy dates at the same time, whittle down to 2 in a few months, be successfully engaged, and happily spend the rest of their life with that person. It's unrealistic. It's no wonder those relationships fail. It stops working in the real world.

POJNnWhDaa	Saving Private Ryan really affected me, I was numb and in shock after I saw it for the first time, and movies don't usually do that. None have since then either.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	The first 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan are the best part of all three of these films but the rest is a snoozefest.<br>  <br>  Your right about the Vietnam protests.  For years people didn't oppose the war, since it was against the spread of communism.  When large numbers of Americans had died, people started to get tired of it, but the real big anti-war protests started when people realized that Americans were committing atrocities in Vietnam.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	I love Band of Brothers-It's the best war movie/made for tv series|`|yRE2HDr3aa	It's close between Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. I'm leaning towards Saving Private Ryan|`|wzNABeYZaa	Saving Private Ryan|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	S.P.R...you must see it.|`|6rExYBxoaa	i hate those films where you can almost feel the suffering of the people. saving private ryan done that when that german dude that they let go free and didnt even try to stop him and gave him a second chance went back and slowly put the knife through the guy that was defending him against the rest of the soldiers and having a laugh with him. if thats not betrayal what is.|`|w9svzs2Saa	I personally think it was Savig Private Ryan. =]<br>  I like the action, the war story, and the love story was the thing that tied it all together. x]|`|iByp9i2Naa	Saving Private Ryan.  Since you've never seen it, you need to watch it.  If the scene of the beach landing at Normandy doesn't humble you, you need to do some soul searching.|`|iS5LwpY5aa	Stripes with Bill Murray. Touching war film. You should check it out.|`|cMsC5a14aa	Private Ryan|`|0fygxRHLaa	Harry Potter!|`|YRRXtVXeaa	none!! you were too young, but DEER HUNTER OF 1978 WAS BEST EVER!! GO RENT IT AND YOU WILL SEE WHY! U WILL LOVE IT|`|8PWsiyv9aa	I really suggest you watch Saving Private Ryan. It is my favorite movie of all time (I'm only 14). Platoon, and Black Hawk Down were very emotional movies but Saving Private Ryan is absolutely gut Wrenching. No matter how many times I watch it I cry. there are too many sad parts to count or talk about. Overall saving Private Ryan was sad and held a very good message. There's nothing good about war, but there's good in why we fight wars. "Earn this...Earn it" <br>  P.S., do you know how many lives were lost in WWII? I'll give a sec... ready? good. the answer is over 60 MILLION! Semper Fi to all those who served.|`|U3KTDopMaa	Saving private ryan and black hawk down dam.<br>  <br>  idk, i like the 2 alot, i own them both. but i would have to sat black hawk down takes it. awesome movie.<br>  <br>  btw, you never saw saving private ryan? wtf.. go watch it lol. really really really good.|`|NY3SKeZJaa	Saving Private Ryan is a great movie. It's one of my favorites, I love the old war movies though. It is extremely touching, all the men going out to find just one man. You definitely need to see it.|`|lrlhdPjJaa	saving private ryan|`|24cb37f7fb9c4bf1d5c91252b52e4ab9aa	It depends who you ask.<br>  <br>  For me, Blackhawk Down is almost unwatchable. It hits too close to home, so to speak. I had a friend (who is now deceased) who was there - in Somalia - for the events depicted in Blackhawk Down,<br>  <br>  I was a small child when the Vietnam War transpired and Platoon, while emotionally riveting, seems distant to me. Someone 10 years older than me would probably feel differently - the way I feel about Blackhawk down.<br>  <br>  Saving Private Ryan took place in 1944. My father was a young boy at the time, but I would wager that my grandfather (who is now passed) would select this film as the most emotionally touching out of the three choices.<br>  <br>  Answer: It depends upon what generation you hail from.|`|3YYa1duaaa	I'd say Platoon, personally. Mainly because of Chris's reaction to what happens over there, and the crime he himself commits.<br>  <br>  Saving Private Ryan is extremely moving too, mainly the beach landing sequence at the start. But it's probably more shocking and horrifying than touching. And I personally found the postscript scene a bit sentimental and manipulative.<br>  <br>  Black Hawk Down was very good too, but I wouldn't say it's as upsetting as either Platoon or SPR. Although you have sympathy for many of the people in the film who die, they are very much portrayed as professional soldiers who are there to do a job.<br>  <br>  I second the recommendation to watch Band of Brothers. I must have seen the whole series four or five times now, and it's incredible in scope, storytelling, acting, writing... and very unsentimental. The penultimate episode never fails to get me snivelling like a baby!|`|ukgx1QGuaa	Well it all depends on what war you find more interesting. I personally think Platoon is one of the best war movies of all time. But that's not the only reason I would pick Platoon, It was the second most bloodiest war in American history next to the Civil War!! So I would give Platoon the nod w/Saving Private Ryan in second. I am also interested in WWII.movies. Running in last would be Black Hawk Down. Hopefully this is the answer you were looking for but that is only my own opinion
O3l33DVJaa	Just by watching the previews was enough for me to say it will be better than that disaster in 1994|`|G0m2kONTaa	I'm sure it will stick to the spirit of the story behind the games far more than the 94 movie did.<br>  <br>  However, it will not have Raul Julia. He put everything he had into that role as M.Bison (it was his last film, as he was dying of cancer while filming and died before it came out). For me, he was the best part of that movie.|`|AA10744842	yes , it will hun.

Keq8vYJLaa	Yeah, I saw it. It was a good episode. Ali told Holly that she was dating Johnny DiMarco, but he said he wasn't. So they broke up. Then, Ali posted an I Hate Holly J thing on face range. She got in big trouble (even w/ the police), apologized to Holly J. Holly came back to school and Ali said things were back to normal again. But Derek told her he brought the rope, and that's how the episode ended.<br>  <br>  <333|`|MbHwygxbaa	I just saw it, OMG it was amazing!!

bribxhsdaa	EDIT - The argument will always hinge on instrumentation and subject matter. Both are obscured by the thought processes of metal fans (generally speaking).<br>  <br>  A man talking about raping a woman to a thrash riff with double bass drums going off in the back will always be better than one man with a microphone and a DJ talking about the same thing (In a metal fans eyes).<br>  <br>  Because:<br>  <br>  a) Most critics of rap idolise instrumentation<br>  b) Most critics of rap can't differentiate between their own cultural hang ups and their ear for music.<br>  --<br>  <br>  People can't make an argument based on hip hop's musical merit because their criticisms are never about musical merit. They're based on subject matter they don't particularly like hearing in a particular style.<br>  <br>  Argument - <br>  <br>  Hip Hop isn't music because it has no definitive musical theory to it.<br>  <br>  It's like poor-man's Jazz Fusion. You can't study "hip hop musical theory". Infact, The only music definitive about hip hop is that it's arranged in 4/4 time.<br>  <br>  And any musical quality involved in hip hop is usually second-hand. Producers like DJ Premier make their names off sampling obscure records that showcase other genres of music rather than the genre in question - Hip Hop. <br>  <br>  If I came into your house and said "I can do handstands" and then showed you a video of my cousin Francis doing a handstand, Would you take me seriously as a gymnast?<br>  <br>  Plus, there aren't even any notes. Hip Hop sucks.<br>  <br>  Argument against my argument -<br>  <br>  The only difference between Hip Hop as "Poor man's fusion" and Jazz Fusion is that Jazz Fusion contains it's own set of unique instrumental/theoretical practices which in itself infers that something can't be taken seriously as music WITHOUT instruments. Secondly, 4/4 time is so common, it's actually called "Common time". That in itself being a moronic as Music is sound arranged over time. The last time I heard a Common record, I'm pretty sure I heard sounds coming out of the guy. <br>  <br>  Notes or "Pitches" (i.e. E flats and G sharps) aren't synonymous with music either. Percussion generally has indefinite (no) pitch (bar things like Marimba's, Glockenspiels, Xylophones etc). Are you not a musician if you play percussion?<br>  <br>  As far as the handstand argument, Sampling is rarely carbon copied, And within hip hop itself, Such practices are frowned upon. "Chopping" is a skill that takes understand of time signature as well as arrangement. <br>  <br>  Most producers will play their own instruments in order to sample and re-arrange them effectively. A producer who doesn't understand musical theory is no worse than a Guitarist who isn't a gearhead (Someone who can rig their own equipment.)<br>  <br>  In short..<br>  <br>  If you don't like Rap, Good for you. If you wanna criticise rap, Keep it exclusively about the music.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	the only thing I can possibly think of that someone could come up with as a good argument would be that when somebody SINGS it's melodic, it's music, but when someone RAPS, well they kinda just talk (right? they kinda kick it spoken word, that's why acappellas are so boring), therefore, rap is not music...<br>  Other than that, most other arguments are just bland... <br>  Some say, "anybody can rhyme"... True (kind of) but doesnt most music have rhyming schemes in the lyrics, it's just that the rap lyrics are more intricate.|`|lMOXHh45aa	*looks at other answer lengths* wow ok lol... i'll try to keep it short <br>  <br>  I can't come up with an original argument... and also, I'm having a hard time understanding why we can accept hip hop as a form of music, but can't accept the fact that Soulja Boy and "Lollipop" are hip hop... and i *BET* the arguments used against them would be made that a non hip hop fan would say... isn't that a contradiction/hypocrisy???|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	I'll play devil's advocate here and make the argument. <br>  <br>  Hip-hop isn't a true musical genre because the music production comes from sampling other peoples songs and re-branding it as your own. In that sense, it's not really original. Additionally, the majority of rappers do not play any instruments or know how to sing. This shows that there is no true talent required to make hip hop, you just need a catchy loop taken from another persons song and then speak your rhymes.<br>  <br>  Of course this argument has some pretty huge holes that any knowledgeable hip hop fan could pick apart. But this view, which I have encountered many times at least uses some shreds of logic.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: You should ask this question in R&P though. I think the answers would be a lot more interesting.|`|3MkgjBrDaa	For those 10 MCs you could name, most could probably name 15 more who are mysoginistic, violent, and materialistic, as well as narcotic. There may be exceptions, but generally it is very vulgar. I recognize hip hop as music, but untalented wannabes negatively impact the reputation of good rappers.|`|hwKFm7H8aa	I myself love Hip hop ( rap )<br>  <br>  but I guess an argument ( the one I hear often ) is that it sounds like spoken word but its not quite poetry. And the rappers don't know how to make "music" like play guitar...<br>  <br>  <br>  The thing with rap ( real rap none of that new **** now days ) is that is only for a certain type of people...not every one can relate to what rappers talk about...so most people just dismiss hip hop as a bunch of hooligans|`|u8hsZ7claa	No, as there isn't such a thing...just like the Loch Ness Monster<br>  <br>  @ Nicole I'm sure I could do the same thing for other genres as well, namely Rock and Pop music|`|l72FO4eMaa	You're hoping to find people's opinions on why they think hip hop isn't music in the Rap and Hip Hop section? If someone didn't think it was music why would they even be in this section?|`|WM5gpOUsaa	this is simple...NO! you can't make an original argument against hip-hop..i'm an old-head ( 38) i've read it all and heard it all..that's my answer tamb.|`|uQ8m8XnJaa	IDK<br>  <br>  ME personally I LOVE HIP HOP<br>  <br>  But if you do to then you should visit <a href="http://www.thehiphopsource.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehiphopsource.com</a>|`|6zv7ezTeaa	Rap is not music. It's just a poem spoken in a way that makes the artist feel hardcore but it really makes them look like a dork. Hip-Hop is different. Hip-Hop is rap with a musical beat; however, I still do not support it. Most, but not all, hip-hop/rap is about gangstas, sex, drugs. fortification, sexism, and other inappropriate things. Are we, as human beings, supporting this behavior? By listening to this ****, yes we are. Sex is private. There is no need to talk about because, quite frankly, NOBODY CARES!! Nobody cares who somebody gang banged, or anything like that, last night. That is what the majority of rap/hip-hop artists talk about, along with drugs and gangs. I would be embarrassed to be in the modern music industry up against such ghetto people who think they are cool. Though some might disagree, this is my opinion and I am entitled to it.|`|zfiplEmbaa	Okay, let me give this a shot...<br>  <br>  I just like trying to make up arguments for stuff..I dont know if I can do this one...<br>  <br>  <br>  okay..rap isn't music (cringes) <br>  <br>  I googled the definition of music....it states that music is (and I quote)<br>  : the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity b: vocal, instrumental, or mechanical sounds having rhythm, melody, or harmony<br>  <br>  Here's the thing..you have to draw a line on what is music and what isnt..lets take our recent election, for example.  There were lots of ads that had a candidate talking over some Americana music or whatever...Does that make this pitch music??? I mean, I"m sure that both the candidates arranged their speech and music so as to create a pleasing sound...so..it this music?? obviously,  no..let me give you another example..Look at MLK's "I have a dream" speech..it was specifically written to be a "vocal sound having rhythm and harmony", right??????/ Is it music???? NO we have to draw a line at what is or isn't music.  <br>  <br>  <br>  So lets go straight to the logical argument..<br>  <br>  From our second example, : speech is not music (Nobody arguing with that???I mean, you can't just talk and call it music ) then logically:<br>  music is not speech.<br>  <br>  rapping is speech<br>  <br>  rapping, therefore must not be music<br>  <br>  but what about if it's set to music???<br>  <br>  <br>  once again, look at our presidential ad example...with the precedents we've set, and we differentiate that from rapping??? no...it's not music, and neither is rap<br>  <br>  IDK, it's the best I could do|`|gUYcVXMTaa	Morning Tambo!<br>  <br>  You know I love hip hop!<br>  <br>  But I think most people that do not do as you said and use the same old tired excusses of how it is not music it is to violent and so forth only say that cuz they have never really listened to hip hop.  Or should I say real hip hop.  It is hard to say the stuff you hear on the radio is real hip hop cuz we know it is not.  By no means is soulja boy and his stupid dances hip hop.  Lolli pop is not hip hop...Etc...<br>  <br>  I work in a very upscale office of which I am the only person of color I always have some music playing from my computer.  The owners son came to my desk for some paperwork and the Black Album was playing.  What More Can I Say Started to play and he knew the first few bars of the opening verse...I said boy do I play this that much that you know the words, he then tells me he has the grey album but really only likes that song cuz of the beat used on the grey album for it.  I asked did you ever sit down and listen to the lyrics?  He said no why would I it is just a song about some drug dealer :(  I told him that was not what that song was about and he should give it a listen print out the lyrics and follow along.  I doubt he ever did!   <br>  <br>  I am also a very big fan of rock music which was hard due the fact I grew up in the "ghetto" and nobody listened to that "kind" of music.  I was often called the darkest white girl in the projects cuz I would have hip hop on side A of the tape and rock on side B (yeah back in the day we used tapes LOL) <br>    <br>  My point is until you listen to the music and fully understand the words being said you can never make or pass judgement on a genre of music!<br>  <br>  (Blushing) You Know How We Do Sweetie!!!

L2nbez3caa	Think of it: More tails Mean recreation of the Kyuubi. 4 tails = Inner flesh. 6 tails = Inner flesh and Bones. It's a step by step Transformation, not as fast as the hachibis transformation.<br>  <br>  Hinata is alive, its Unlikely that Kyuubis Chakra can heal somebody besides Naruto (or does Hinata mutates to another Mini Kyuubi o.O don't think so, but would be fun)<br>  but Hinata should get out of there ASAP so who might be Iditic enough to rescue her... (besides Naruto who seems more like Berserk mode) I think it won't be one, more like one Group is rescuing Hinata, the other detects Nagato, Deva must retreat slight Naruto focus on him, the other snatch Hinata and Tsunade heals Hina... since Tsunade only a few steps from Death Door without retreat option she might use a similar Jutsu like the one which resurected Gaara.<br>  (You now, she is Old now and will never be young again... or helas hina and reives Kakashi... njo that would be quite something, but seems more like wish thinking)<br>  <br>  But another thing... Think of Itachis gift as an inner Sharingan, like a Mind Sharingan for Naruto, so he Learns to Control the Kyuubi... then her uses Full Kyuubi Mode in fulle Control and the uses Nature Energie and a Mix out of Kyuubi and Senin Mode... And maybe then even uses a red Futon Rasen Shuriken... ... ... okay XD Welcome in the World of DB where are the items to restore the World XD (or at least Land)<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Naruto 439 Spoiler Photos<br>  <a href="http://my-naruto-blog.blogspot.com/2009/03/naruto-chapter-439-spoiler-raw.html" rel="nofollow">http://my-naruto-blog.blogspot.com/2009/...</a>|`|ckeBvt23aa	Well, in a nutshell, it makes me thirst for more.

I wish the fight would kind of be over with so we can see what happens AFTER!|`|QzN9K7cnaa	Well, I'm so anxious about what's going to happen next.<br>  Naruto is already in his 6 tailed form and Pein looks like he is loosing but he is going to attack naruto with his secret technique.

It's customary, conventional if you will, for them to be performed as a generic whole.  And not so with the Beethoven sonatas; not generally speaking.  <br>  <br>       The so called "Moonlight" for instance.

xPFi02Avaa	It looks like your question drew in a bunch of 15 year olds. I hate it when people respond just to respond and it is no help! <br>  <br>  Anyway I completely understand where your coming from and I personally know girls that are exactly like this. I have tried to motivate them and do all I could for their children but there really is nothing you can do. If the mother or even married couple doesn't want to help themselves or their family they wont. It is really sad that people who can work choose not to..Don't they realize that a couple hundred dollars is nothing!?! People with children should be responsible enough to provide for their families and be able to have all necessities of life. Living on welfare is not going to give you or your children all they need. I have told my friends that millions of times too and all they say is i know. Then the excuses start. That's just it though when you have another life to take care of besides your own there are no longer any excuses! you get off your butt and make something of yourself! Or else your child will end up just like you! The only thing you yourself can do is try to motivate her..but it sounds like it would unfortunately be a waste of your time. Does she at least take care of her children? are they fed and clean and have clothes that fit them? You could always call cps even though that's kind of harsh on the children.|`|giuzEeucaa	Haha...

Also if you are going to be serious about music then yes I think you should invest a bit more in your instrument.  I personally dont like fender sound, but If I had to chose id go for the American.

b1xPuPNFaa	Its obviously entirely possible that she's dead. Since we did see Pain's spike/sword thing dripping blood. At the very least he did stab her.<br>  <br>   But Naruto's vision was blocked by a ridge of rock that was blasted up into a crater when Pain used Shinra Tensei to slam Hinata into the ground. <br>  <br>  Naruto (the point of view we had) didn't show Hinata.<br>  <br>   We saw a shot of Pain holding a sword over Hinata, whom we couldn't see.<br>  <br>  Then we had a shot of the sky with a bloody sound effect. <br>  <br>  Then we see Pain leaning down, stabbing Hinata whom we still can't see. <br>  <br>  Then we see a shot of Pain's spike, dripping blood. <br>  <br>  Now, it possible Pain did kill Hinata. Obviously that's what Naruto thinks. But I rather think Pain didn't kill her. Hinata's a small fry, and I honestly don't think Pain would consider her worth killing. Just my opinion. He only seemed to kill people when they actually get in his way, and Hinata didn't even phase Pain. Rather pathetic of Hinata actually. <br>  <br>  Also, we didn't actually see Hinata impaled, like we saw the Gramps, the old toad. When characters in Naruto actually DIE, we usually get visual confirmation. There is OVERWHELMING circumstantial evidence that Pain just slammed that spike through her heart, but its definitely being left open for her to make a come back. <br>  <br>  After Pain stabs her, we don't get a shot of him actually holding the bloody spike. We see the bloody spike dripping against the stone, but it looks like Pain left it in her, and that together with the fact that we didn't ACTUALLY SEE her get killed suggests to me that that this is whats going on:<br>  <br>  1. Pain doesn't consider Hinata much of an issue. <br>  2. Pain simply stuck one of his chakra electrode things through Hinata to immobilize her, just like he just did to Naruto. Thats why we see a bloody spike; Pain just stabbed her through the shoulder or something. <br>  3. Pain seemed to be deliberately provoking Naruto, which is rather... odd considering when Naruto gets angry he can go on murderous rampages.<br>  <br>  Although, if Pain has Naruto immobilized like this, why does he provoke him into going Demon Fox? I think he's trying to alienate him from the rest of Konoha, remember that all of his friends (most of which don't know what he is) and the entire village is watching this battle. And they've just seen Naruto go off in a huge blast of blackish energy and transform into a howling monster. <br>  <br>  And considering the fact that Pain provoked Naruto, knowing who he is, and that we know the only thing that can control the Nine Tails is the Mangekyo Sharingan.... And both Obito and Sasuke have sworn to destroy Konoha.... Where the hell are those two? <br>  <br>  Right now, we have Naruto in 6-tailed mode. I really doubt God Realm Pain alone is going to stand much of a chance. Naruto in Sage Mode got rid of the other 5 Pain's without too much trouble. <br>  <br>  Rather, I think Pain deliberately hurt Hinata, and blew up the Leaf Village, and had this whole weird debate with Naruto just to provoke Naruto.... Now that the Nine Tails is out, anyone with the Mangekyo Sharingan can take control of Naruto. <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think Pain killed Hinata, because the chapter avoided showing her actually dead, killing Hinata when he already had Naruto would be out of character. I think he pretended to kill Hinata to get Naruto to go Nine Tails.... And if in the next few chapters Obito jumps in and uses his Sharingan to take control of Naruto and send him on a killing spree across what survives of Konoha, and then FORCE him to come get the Kyuubi extracted, that wouldn't surprise me. <br>  <br>  Really, Obito or Sasuke was far the more logical choice to capture Naruto, not Pain. With their Sharingan they can control the Nine Tails "Like a pet" so why send Pain to get him forcibly? I think Obito is hiding out somewhere. <br>  <br>  Wow thats long, but in summary, I think Hinata's alive because we didn't really see her killed, it would be out of character for Pain, Pain seems too calm and unsurprised by Naruto's transformation and it would be the first death in the "Rookie Nine" and it would be too pessimistic an ending to Hinata's plot. If anyone in the Rookie Nine dies, it will be given significantly more screen time and we'll definitely be shown a dead body to confirm it.|`|DO7nz8aRaa	Its okay for some deaths to occur, but why the best characters such as kakashi and jiraiya. If Hinata dies, however, that's where I draw the line and boycott the series because, honestly, most people don't want her dead, and will probably draw the line with her death. Honestly when an author writes it's for the entertainment of his audience, yes, us not so he can screw us over all this. If he's doing it to just add climax its ok, but if he kills her then let's boycott so who's with me.|`|X45rxI7gaa	No, she can't be dead, Pain is not the guy to kill someone like Hinata, she stands no chance so why kill her? She's like NO THREAT to him so he has no reason to kill her even for interfering.<br>  <br>  But that was an amazing moment when she confessed, the most memorable moment in Naruto! Hinata was always #1 anime girl on my list but now the gap is farther away from #2|`|ehF2XiMbaa	Dude I do not know but I just finished reading and if Kishi killed her I am so suing his ***.

Though I think it's too soon for her to die because Naruto just found out how she felt. That would be lame to kill her right after her happiest moment in life.|`|5a2eKYynaa	Although as a Hinata fan it pains me to say this, I think she probably is dead, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  If she's still alive, what's going to happen next? Things would likely be pretty awkward between Naruto and Hinata. Whether he loved her or not, he'd probably feel like he'd have to date her after what she did for him. Also, Hinata isn't really that important to the series as a whole, making her the perfect sacrifice victim to enrage Naruto into further levels of badassery. Finally, why exactly would Pain spare her? He's shown no signs of mercy so far. He basically nuked Konoha, presumably killing thousands of civilian men, women and children. What reason would he have to spare a young girl who basically threw herself into the line of fire?<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the Rookie 9 have so far been protected from death due to plot immunity. Hinata is still one of that group, even though she's rarely involved with the plot nowadays. And Pain may have merely incapacitated her to trigger the Kyuubi transformation, since Hinata would most likely be killed in the crossfire anyway, so why waste the effort of killing her? The fact that the death is offscreen is also suspicious. Last but by no means least, Hinata is popular with the fandom and this might save her, although Kakashi was more popular and seems to be truly dead, so it might not help her after all.<br>  <br>  Overall, I think it's very likely that Hinata is dead, but I wouldn't be surprised if she was somehow resurrected, like Gaara, or she may be on the brink of death and get saved by advanced medical jutsu from Tsunade and/or Sakura. After all, Chouji and Neji both 'died' in part 1 and vere saved that way. If she is saved, I wouldn't be surprised if she's left in a coma for a while to avoid the awkwardness surrounding her and Naruto.|`|dpAD1KoEaa	I doubt it... if she is i'm gonna sue the writer...|`|PRc21DZsaa	No!  For a simple reason:<br>  <br>  When I read that chappy I was like... "NO!"<br>  <br>  I honestly doubt that she's dead. Hinata's too strong to be beaten by one attack...well, it was from Pein...but I think it's too anti-climactic. If she dies, it'll be (In my opinoin) some huge battle where she manages to at least mortally injure her opponent.<br>  <br>  Of course, it's probably just my depseratism for her NOT to die...but after such a beautiful confession...No! I refuse to believe it!|`|u62I3fM6aa	Jeez, I hope she's dead. I mean she confessed her love to him. That's supposed to be Sakura. And did you read the part where Pain said that how his parents were killed. Sorry to be cold, but I don't like her. And if Naruto and Hinata ends up together i'm just going to soooo mad and probobly stop reading Naruto for good. I mean, the only reason why I read Naruto manga was to see if Sakura and Naruto ends up together. It would be a total  waste of time if Naruto and Hinata ends up together. Ugh!|`|35aa6dcf3de4ecb9aa30d3c58ec123edaa	I don't think so|`|HUdCBaJ0aa	nope|`|11bff08b554753fe469637fd0e48a807aa	I really hope not I actually liked Hinata. I don't think Pein would be bothered with actually killing her I think it may just be to rile Naruto|`|Y6HWgx3Eaa	i really hope not, kishimoto knows fans really like her character, i was surprised when they killed shizune off|`|dViHyaxfaa	Hinata confesses her love in a very large section.  The confession of love has been sought for a long time. It would be an ultimate tragedy if Hinata was to die, but this happens in many novels. It forces the audience to grieve with Naruto. After Hinata is wounded on the ground, Pain looks as though he is driving his stake into Hinata, there is a sound effect to which i assume is a swoosh. Then you see Pain's eye, one looks as though it is focusing on Hinata, and after another sound effect looks towards Naruto and then Naruto yells "Stop!" The fact that Naruto yells after Pain's movement stop instead of "Hinata!" leads me to belive she is still alive. Also Hinata's fight was underplayed, with all of her emotion carried into the fight, the two hit kill would be a serious writing blunder. If the writer was to kill a main character, an epic battle with Hinata almost getting Pain would be called for. I would be more certain if I knew what the top of page 14 said, howerver since I do not know, I can not be certain, but I am convinced that Hinata is still alive due to the lack of time and focus accerted on the battle. She might be seriously injured though. This is more likely, then her death will have the chance to be focused on. The climatic expression of love has to be resolved first before she dies. For even the short lived villians had their death dialogue.<br>  <br>  If Hinata is dead though, I feel that the writer is forgetting his audience. The killing off of too many allies closley tied to Naruto in such a short time is enraging. However, the aftermath is where the author will show his true purpose. <br>  <br>  The author has created a estrangement and uneasy feelings in his readers. And these readers are clambering for more. This is my first time where I can not possible wait for the next chapter. It feels as though I am waiting in a hospital emergancy room waiting for the doctor to approach me.  With that uneasy feeling in my gut of bad news but the prayer and hope for good news.  To those that share the anticipation I wish us luck.|`|axUJTRvfaa	She is so hot! They can't let her die! i won't accept it! i'll keep reading if she does die but I WILL BE SERIOUSLY PISSED!!!!! DON'T LET THIS HOT CHARACTER DIE!!!!!!|`|TlNc1Svuaa	There is no certain answer to that question. <br>  It is fairly certain she was stabbed by Pain as can be gathered by reading the manga. The presents three possible conditions she might be in; dead, critically wounded, or lightly wounded. <br>  In the first instance that is likely the end of her story, her death in such a manner will probably facilitate some change in the story or in the character of Naruto.<br>  In the second instance things get more interesting. Some of the critically or mortally wounded of The Hidden Leaf village seem to survive against impossible odds, for example Choji and Neji during the failed mission to bring Sauske back to the village. If Hinata is critically injured then it is about a 50/50 chance that help will arrive on time or she will die for the reason I already stated.<br>  If she is lightly wounded then there is little to worry about, it would take a long time to just bleed to death. In my opinion this instance is the least likely as that would require some amount of sloppiness or mercy on the part of Pain.<br>  If Hinata is dead or not, the author knows what he is doing. If she does die it will be for a reason.|`|rz8z0VkIaa	I kinda hope so....<br>  <br>  It makes her confession all the more powerful for naruto if she did die. But knowing this series I doubt it.... I want to see naruto kick into all nine tails !!!!! D8<|`|fA7OlHZHaa	I don't think she is because doesn't she still have Katsuyu on her, which i think could keep her alive, and I don't really think that Shizune is really dead either, I mean can't they still get her "soul" back, and if she was dead then why are they carrying her around?|`|jhVV8TkIaa	Well I think 99.9 % is that she is dead. Just to refresh your memories during chapter 436, Pa frog or Naruto 's teacher Fukasaku is already "stabbed" from Pain and from a very clear view, we already know that he is on his way to meet Jiraiya. In fact if he as an MOST important character is gone, how is Naruto going to fight with Tobi or even Sasuke against Mangekyo Sharingan ? <br>  <br>  In fact from now on we should be more worried if this time any "god" or "Sage" can save Naruto from being "fried by Amaterasu" by the "last of Uchiha 2" instead of worrying whether Hinata is dead or alive.Since even Pa Frog has to report to Heaven, this development has already proved that Kishimoto is not afraid of "removing characters" be it important or not.<br>     <br>  Finally, Hinata do not appear or "contribute" in Naruto manga much other than Chunnin exam and search for Itachi arc, no offensive to Hinata fan, but I think that in term of heroine, she is not like Saya Otonashi from Blood + whereby she is the "last hope" standing for humanity, otherwise without her blood to fight against Chiropteran, human race is doomed.(I am not saying that being ordinary is wrong) Even Naruto is still classified as "a clown" and he can't even be compared to central character like Saya. Therefore the only thing that we can hope for Hinata is that she will be born as an happy girl in the next life.|`|vysN45yraa	HAS MASASHI GONE MAD!? FIRST JIRAIYA THEN KAKASHI CHOJIS DAD SHIZUNE AND NOW HINATA!? well I think Kakashi and Hinata might still be alive Kakashi might have just been dreaming and Hinata might have katsuya on her back so she might not be dead(was wondering if someone could confirm this) First off lets look at the motives behind killing 2 main charracters <br>  1st the push pull theory u take something away when its most wanted (them dieing) makes you want them/like them more<br>  2nd to make you keep reading<br>  3rd (reason for Hinatas death/seemingly death) to push naruto into the six tailed state I mean what else would have triggered this besides sacrificeing Hinata <br>  4th Might see how people respond to Hinatas and Kakashis deaths before he confirms them dead <br>  <br>  Also note- Later in the manga after Kakashi dies he had a Katsuya on his neck if Im not mistaken so he might be climging to life and could be in a dream like state/coma so he could make it (I mean why have him see his father and have a dream making u more interest in him if hes dead anyways? that would just be poorly written out<br>  <br>  SO HERES WHAT YOU DO SPAMMMMMMMM!!!! ON EVERY GOD DAMNED FORUM YOUTUBE SITE AND YAHOO ANSWERS ABOUT HOW HINATA/ KAKASHI BETTER NOT BE DEAD THE MORE FUSS YOU MAKE THE BETTER OF A CHANCE HINATA/KAKASHI WILL HAVE TO SURVIVEING!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  ........never though I'd say this but its up to us before Misashi writes that next chapter TO SPAM FOR HINATAS LIFE!! DONT LOSE HOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|YnkfNlMVaa	ehh i am kinda 50/50... when i reread the chapter, there were a few hints that pain didnt actually kill her.<br>  1) he is almost out of energy, why waste it on a suicidal <br>  2) seems too random for a rookie nine to die like that (so not kishi style)<br>  3) at the last page pain says "but... my pain is greater than yours", which could mean that he actually spared her.<br>  4) lastly i think he spared her because he might want to show her what she loves really is a monster fox or maybe he saw the paperchick in her (konan?)<br>  <br>  personal opinion not related to question (aka random bsing): its a ninja world, so realistic reasons are void. after all it is fiction haha, u might think they are dead but WOW! ALIVE!... we have seen **** load of fake deaths, but anyways i wanna see some gaara, lee action T_T <br>  <br>  for those of u who said that pain might have killed 10000 other guys in konoha, well he didnt kill them intentionally, it was kinda an aoe effect.|`|3qhmf0eOaa	Hopefully -_-; She's useless, if she isn't I will be so mad >_<....|`|822a0e7502e7fde2224e2cfc02e4bb20aa	No she isn't dead, like it or not.<br>  <br>  Very few Good Characters die in Naruto. Three reasons why Hinata isn't dead:<br>  <br>  1) Not nearly enough time was spent her before she died. When Jiraiya or any other character died, loads of chapters were dedicated to them. Jiraiya had loads of revelations, flashbacks etc.<br>  <br>  2) There's no reason to kill her. All Kishimoto needs is to have her hurt so Naruto will go Six Tails. Jiraiya needed to die. or else Naruto wouldn't be that angry over the fact "Oh, Jiraiya got beat but he's still alive."<br>  <br>  3) Pain isn't the sort of villian to just kill everything he sees, after all, he more of a sort of Kira from Death Note type villian. He's evil, we know that, but we know that he's truely doing what he believes is good. His intentions are good, it's his method we consider evil. Pain wouldn't kill Hinata, as she's no threat to him. Pain didn't want to kill Jiraiya, but had to because he was a huge threat to him, and needed to be killed for the sake of "peace"<br>  <br>  All this logic was applied to when Kakashi seemed he was dead. And he turned out not to be. The same logic I used I'm now using on Hinata, and I'm sure she won't be dead.|`|1o7nc1mpaa	yeah she did die. it was obvious that she would. sakura is the right girl for naruto.|`|J8GcOWf2aa	i think she is. dead or not....the naruto series is far past its half way mark :(<br>  <br>  that was rlly gay btw how hinata just comes out and and yells i love you *dies*.  even if she lives....the entire manga has recently just sucked ..... a real let down if you ask me. they could have made it so much better.<br>  <br>  spoiler alert: pein is a nerdy 40 year old living in the basement of his dead parents 500000000 foot tower <br>  <br>  xD|`|UNmS0easaa	Listen up.<br>  <br>  Kakashi, is dead. For those who think not, he is. Sorry to break it to you. As for Hinata? Well no one can be too sure. I mean, you can believe she is dead because the differences in strength between Pein and Hinata is very large. Also with Pein's sadistic way of viewing pain and bringing it upon others, you would most likely think he would kill her because he is further demonstrating pain to Naruto. Why would Kishimoto kill off Hinata when she finally confessed her love? Simple. That ends Hinata's whole character plot. She constantly hid her love from Naruto and watched him from a far since the very beginning and now she finally has the courage to reveal her feelings to Naruto. What if she is alive? <br>  <br>  What will Naruto and Hinata do? Start dating? Doesn't that seem unlikely since 99.9 percent of the whole manga has been her hiding her feelings since the beginning? Or is all this death a sign that the manga is ending soon?<br>  <br>  Why she could possibly not be dead? Well the chances are slim but Kishimoto might just be trying to pull our legs. Anyone notice how he never actually shows Hinata completely dead or him stabbing her? But...that could just be his way of making the scene more dramatic. Percentage wise I believe you all probably have a slim 20 percent chance that your beloved Hinata is alive. Sorry to break it to you again.|`|AA12245149	I don't believe she's dead. I HOPE she isnt! She's one of my favorite characters! Probably just severely wounded. We're just gonna have to wait until the next few issues....|`|Bj3BgdLRaa	I don't think so why would you kill a well liked character in just a two or three page death gaara got three chapters and they brought him back to life.|`|JkUGqoZQaa	NO WAY, MANY OTHER ANSWERS, BUT I THINK SHE IS NOT DEAD, EITHER NARUHINA OR NARUSAKU, YES, BUT ALWAYS A LINGERING LOVE, AGREED, HER CHARACTER IS THE SHY TYPE, BUT WE HAVE ALL SEEN HER GROW THROUGHOUT THE SERIES, AND LETS JUST WAIT!!!!!!!! GOD, KISHI COULD JUST BE SCREWIN WITH US! AND THIS IS MY FIRST POST EVER, SO I PUT THOUGHT INTO THIS. NOT!!!!|`|UdXx62Omaa	i think shes dead, it kinda makes sence, i mean the only way to solve the whole triangle with him sakura and hinata would be to kill one of them, i mean naruto wouldnt be with hinata as long as sakura was alive, and if he wound up with sakura while hinata would be alive that would be even more sad for her, i think shes dead<br>  <br>  I HOPE KAKASHI ISNT THOUGH!!!!!!!!|`|bTjQJfhVaa	Gees Masashi Kishimoto......just death happy these last chapters......Asuma, Kakashi, Shinuze ( idk how to spell her name ) half of Kohona, possibly Tsunade in the next couple chapters, NOW HINATA! gees someone is angry at the world this year........oh you know it's true|`|0BYgzu4Kaa	I believe hinata is most likely dead because pain said that this is how the konoha ninjas killed his parents meaning that he has an overwhelming grudge against the hidden leaf village. Secon of all since when do u know pain being merciful, he is a shinobi with no remorse who believes what he is doing is a form of bringing "justice" to the world. I have 2 say the whole hinata intervention caught me off guard but there is little evidence pointing that she is still alive. but we wont know unless the next chapter shows up. Also im more of a narusaku fan rather than naruhina since the writer never put any empahsis regarding that naruto will eventually start a relationship with hinata.|`|xcZviqkQaa	I highly doubt she is dead. I mean when Aizen stabbed Hinamori in bleach we all thought she was dead. Many chapters later she just popped out of the blue again, then, yet again, chapters later she made a comeback and saved Matsumoto. Lol.<br>  <br>  But if she does die, I will be so F*****g pissed..|`|7ojsIkB9aa	Well if she really is dead<br>  here are some theories for you<br>  <br>  Option A<br>  <br>  While all these events are happening <br>  He is already having his inner battles<br>  then Naruto beg the Kyubi<br>  to save her or something and break part of the seal<br>  hence forming the 6-tail form<br>  Kyubi regenerate her but she grows fox tail & ears days later. <br>  <br>  Option B<br>  <br>  It was a kage-bunshin/Genjutsu all along!<br>  The clone disappeared when Pein stabbed it. <br>  Something she learned from Kurenai maybe,<br>  Naruto did not see it though.<br>  <br>  Option C<br>     <br>  6-tails beat hoax Pein body in front of him,<br>  Ino's dad group find Pein cornering him or at least <br>  force him to retreat(running low on chakra).<br>  When Naruto comes to his senses,<br>  Tsunade gets a major role,  We finally see her in <br>  her real age and order to gather all casualties <br>  (Hinata,Shizune, Kakashi, etc).<br>  As hokage it's her sworn duty to ensure the next <br>  generation, uses up her most powerful healing <br>  jutsu to revive everyone <br>  (w/ help w/ kyubi/sage chakra if needed). <br>  <br>  She remembers Jiraiya,Orochimaru,Dan, <br>  brother,Sarutobi, the 4th, Etc. <br>  basically her entire life flashes before her eyes <br>  before kicking the bucket  (in other words another <br>  Chiyo, ending the san-nin saga) <br>  Then everyone Mourns for her especially Sakura <br>  & Shizune then She have a drinking party w/ <br>  Jiraiya & Orochimaru in the next world.<br>  <br>  Then Naruto is proposed to be Hokage which he <br>  flatly refused, then Kakashi become temporary <br>  stand-in Hokage until Naruto accepts it.<br>  Well I would write something like this if I were <br>  Kishi. Then again I'm not him and it's his manga <br>  so let's just wait until his next release, Want to see <br>  the new Hanabi soon too.<br>   <br>  The way the Hyuuga assistant worries about <br>  Hinata means she has secured her place as head <br>  successor of the clan I suppose.<br>  <br>  Oh and the fainting thing is a running gag <br>  a bit overused in the anime but is seldom present in the manga I think.<br>  <br>  Conclusion: <br>              <br>  Wait for the next chapter/s then read it and you <br>  will know, until then everything would be just speculation.|`|lxgDZ5cZaa	i hope she does die,cause im sick of her"well um...um...*faints*. i mean really,no 1 in the world studders that much. <br>  anyway there relationship would be boring,hinatas just there, she doesnt do anything except stand there and look like a dumb ***.<br>   hinatas not interesting anyway,but that was messed up kishi.|`|IQjLeh1Iaa	Honestly, I would say it is quite possible that Hyuuga Hinata is in fact dead.  As terrible as it would be right after she confessed her love to Naruto, it is possible.  <br>  <br>  Pain while some may think he wouldn't see Hinata as a threat, wouldn't really care.  He kills without remorse, anyone who thinks otherwise apparently missed the chapter where he basicaly nuked Konoha and killed most of the innocent villagers that weren't even Shinobi.|`|bC8b4aveaa	i doubt it.<br>  <br>  it would seem she was stabbed by pein. but naruto was already stabbed a couple times and he's not dead. yet.<br>  <br>  also, if hinata dies, im sure fans will send hate mail to kishimoto to sway him. unless kishimoto was already expecting it... its all part of a grand scheme >_>;;|`|811125f457952f57b9962de0b271f085aa	just wanted to reply to a couple of folks down there who said that "It's out of character for Pain to kill Hinata"<br>  <br>  As far as i remember, all Pain has done since he paid a little visit to Konoha is Kill Kill Kill...Jiraiya killed, Kakashi pwned/comatose/or killed?, Shizune killed like a mortal kombat fatality and probly majority of the konoha citizens after that collossal shinra tensei on the city.....so saying that killing hinata is out of character for Pain is wrong.<br>  <br>  It is pretty obvious that the manga is nearing its end. I just dont like this rushed version of kishimoto.......he's like freakin Light Yagami in death note scribblin away all these characters' names down in his deathnote killin them all. I have this GUT FEELIN that Tsunade will die too, not in Pein's hands however but in DANZOU's....He wants to be Hokage and he has all the motive in the world to stab tsunade in the back while she's in this weak and fragile state. Danzou never liked the "will of fire platform"  of the old Hokages....so i think Tsunade is next.  This is just too fast man. Naruto's like a freakin drug and i feel like kishimoto's overdosin me too fast man.|`|mzAtHMRzaa	Nah, I don't think they would kill off one off the Naruto's fan base characters and if they did...... Damn that's ****** up!!!!!! <br>  But what a way to Hinata to confess her love for Naruto am I right?|`|5l8krh0faa	I don't think hinata is dead. Basically that is the point of the writer, for us to feel the character of Pain. If she is dead after her confession, Naruto's image of undying will to save everyone he loves will be damage.|`|NjzBw5P3aa	Nope....I believe she's very much alive! <br>  If u read "Naruto" chapter 437 ~[slowly]~ u will notice sum things! Kishimoto led us 2 believe kakashi was dead but he was only sleeping. And I also found an early sketch of hinata (If u want I'll send it 2 u) with naruto in the background. What I'm saying is she can't be dead because It seems like he made her out 2 be with naruto in the future...|`|edbVoaaraa	Noo Hinata Cant die!!!! Not now that she told naruto that she love him T_T everyone i love dont love me specially now that im in love again and she dont want anything with me over friendship that is so painful because she is the person most important in my life and i cant forget her, so if i cant have the person i most love in real life then hinata will survive i will protect her and i will marry with her xD haha<br>  <br>  joking, i hope she is not dead for real already died a lot of ppl because that big MFckr pain and hinata is so sweet *.* (i would like if some girl told me that love me too) and finally could express whatfuckedeels about naruto after 10 years xD and now pain is fvcked up because naruto has 6 tails this time i cant wait to discover whats next the title is end i hope is not naruto end lol he cant control 4 tails even more 6 his state is so painful when pain hit hinata that he passed from normal to kyuubi six tails in a moment... to get 3 in a moment he needed a lot of rage what about 6? O.O<br>  Naruto will certainly control him by his rage defeat pain save hinata and save konoha<br>  <br>  EDIT: btw hinata express his feelings and get hit its a good way to make naruto transform into 6 tails for the first time, and she maybe not dead for real and naruto will blame himself because she died for him<br>  <br>  Hinata for me dont die T_T dont break my heart like everyone do!|`|kP4M6FdQaa	I hope not!

Cuz Naruto likes hinata as well, that`s why he was so angry that he transformed into the fox directly with 6 tails. <br>  <br>  If she didn`t die this are the options i see:<br>  <br>  1.- Hinata and Naruto will be together in the future. (i think could be a relationship just like asuma-kurenai) kind of secret<br>  2.- Naruto says no thanks, i want to be free<br>  <br>  If she died this are his options:<br>  <br>  1.- Naruto could stay with sakura (Don`t think so, seriously)<br>  2.- Naruto will be just like Ero-Senin Jiraya lonely and chasing girls.|`|msRSLBcqaa	well....idk relly i mean suck if she died but it wouldnt effect much(hence her uselessness) but man i fell bad for naruto he must be goin f***ing crazy hes could destroy anything and every thing in sight right now.

I cried endlessly, more than I cried for Obito Uchiha.<br>  Just after confessing her (beautiful, undying) love for Naruto, Pein comes and kills her.<br>  One thing I really regret is Naruto going into 6 tailed form. If he hurts himself, I swear, Hinata (if she did) would have died for nothing.<br>  If Kishimoto decides to kill Naruto as well, I'll do something so desperate....<br>  I'll convert to Bleach-ism.<br>  I hope all of you support me in this.

In addition to that we didn't see Pein stabbing Hinata so there is no clue that she's dead. However she belongs to Kishi so we can't be sure. He can do whatever he wants with her.|`|5WTBX5euaa	im srry but agree with freakzilladark 1095989959569+5% i knew from the moment she went down there, she was gonna die, stupid whore should've stated out of a mans fight, jk, but yeah she should've stayed out.|`|a2P8UfNBaa	O PLZ NO!!!

You know how everyone says Kishimoto is unpredictable.(I kind of hate how he always knockcs her out when there is a good fight like when the snake dude attacked konoha and the hokage died and other stuff like that!!) Maybe before he stabbed her she did some weird chakra trick and that like was somehow successful like that chakra point thing that Neji does.(havent read it in a while but I hope you get what I'm talking about) Well maybe his power is decreasing at the moment. She might not be dead but if those other ninjas (shikamaru negi and everyone else) show up they might do something OR Hinata might stop Naruto from going pokemon foxxy guy!<br>  They will have a touhcing long moment and Hinata will get up and fight and use all her power.<br>  <br>  My second theory is that Hinata will be knocked out the whole time and live or die but whos knows you only have to wait a few days be patient kids;)|`|Z02BBNhqaa	Well no mean to rave here, but I think Kishi's going to pull something weird on us, and as much as I hate the use of Deux-ex-machina as much as the next guy, blowing up more than halve of Konoha, killing Kakashi, Shizune, and Hinata? <br>  <br>  So unless he wants to loose a good chink of his fan base something is going to be different from what it seems. We already know he's capable of it (seriously, I expected Itachi to be 'an undercover agent' for the Hokage in some fan fictions, but in canon?).<br>  <br>  And to answer the question, I believe that he didn't kill her off, I'm waiting for some kind of final confirmation, like when Kakashi died.|`|GJEcCoXLaa	well, one thing for sure, i think if she really dead, the popularity of this manga will go down...because, naruto is to much loose the people who close to him.....|`|tcSW3Oy4aa	Hinata is not dead i have evidence from this web page it states hinata was not stabbed by pain. Pain merely stabbed the ground before naruto goes QB.  When you stab some1 blood stays on the rod and when you stab the ground the blood will pour out just look at this diagram/picture|`|hbHZNjePaa	No don't think so.<br>  <br>  Well i don't know if anyone said this already. But u don't see pain do anything infact if u read the manga again there is a rock in the way of him doing it u see blood yes but that it . And as someone said the new generation is ment to live and the past one dies if Hinata did die now she would be the first of the new Gen and as we all know there are many others we wanna see kick the bucket before her.|`|iOdMyHkOaa	For gods sake<br>  <br>  SHE IS DEAD. ...<br>  <br>  She should have thought twice b4 tangling with the awsome powers of the Deva Pain . .. <br>  <br>  If she really wanted to help she should gone to shikamaru and blha blah . .. <br>  <br>  Look what she did ? ?<br>  <br>  She has switched on Naruto's-6-tail-mode<br>  <br>  Sure if pain didnt kill her Naruto's-6-tail-mode- will Disintegrate her. .. <br>  <br>  Hinata is Out of the picture now. .. <br>  <br>  But Kakashi is not.. he is still alive...<br>  <br>  And it will be boring she is alive after the Pain Invasion .. .<br>  <br>  If she is alsive there will endless chapters naruhina. . .<br>  <br>  It will be a drag. . .<br>  <br>  Hope hinata dies<br>  <br>  Dattebayo !!!!|`|1uynUtDgaa	It's a hard one. But I'm almost positive she is dead. Kishimoto had something like a time out where he could think out the rest of the plot. She wasn't a major figure and even if Naruto hadn't shown any interest in her before, at least not the same way he invited Sakura, I must highlight the fact that he had changed. If you noticed she is a lot prettier in the last few pages she was drawn in. I think the only reason she would be kept alive is by fluke ot fate or something... I wish to read the next chapter but Im terrified ;(|`|3NNVTPfpaa	F*** YOU KISHIMOTO!<br>  <br>  kill hinata and im gonna stop reading Naruto!<br>  <br>  :((|`|i5wykhXuaa	I think Pein stabbed her when she was down from trying to protect Naruto. She might be dead. While I hope she's not, only Masashi Kishimoto(and his partners can decide how it ends|`|SLML3i5jaa	What's with all these "I doubt it" and "I hope not"? Hinata confessed her love, attacked Pain and was crushed. Pain gave Naruto a glance and then stabbed her to death so that Naruto would know the pain he felt when Konoha's ninjas killed his parents. She's dead, and that's why Naruto went berserk with six tails.|`|JdyEvXXtaa	I hope not!  Because if she is...<br>  <br>  Well, back when Sasuke was fighting Itachi, I said to my friend that what would happen was Naruto would intervene, then Hinata would go in after him and get killed.  (My friend kind of looked at me like, "How do you come up with these things??!"<br>  And if she is dead now, that would mean that my prediction would be kind of right (just, like, a year late)!  NO!!<br>  Especially after that confession... <3 <3  *instant inspiration for an AMV*|`|FsFpGzK8aa	please.... don't let her die, i will ******* hate the writer if she dies...... :( im not gonna be happy. also good going to naruto for his 6th tail!!! the fight with pain is gonna be as epic as the fight with CS2 sasuke vs. One - Tailed naruto...(the good old days, when it was all about Rasengan and not Wind Release: Rasenshuriken).<br>   <br>  Update: i have come to realise something... that is very heart Pwning. listern to me now i have to write this for all of you to understand, <br>  <br>  Hinata is 75% likely dead, why ? you ask now well ill tell you. Its Sakura and Naruto for a reason is that throughout the ENTIRE Manga Naruto has focused on her and Yamato even said to Sakura - you must really ???? but we dont get to her the rest for some reason (i cant remember why). now she has started to "LOVE" him, its kinda the writers idea to have them together (i dont want them to be together). we all knew it could go 1 of 2 ways for naruto.... hinata or sakura but since Pain has likely killed hinata its sakura now. also Pain would kill hinata for the reason is (this is the ULTIMATE POINT in the Entire comment) he says - This is just like... HOW* my parents were KILLED* by Konoha Ninja, right before my eyes. <br>  <br>  Pain is my Next point, i hear everyone saying OMG that anit pains character... well it kinda is, he killed hinata for 3 reasons <br>  1. so naruto could know TRUE pain like himself<br>  2. so the writer could have naruto with sakura and end this Massive issue about naruto and hinata (it was always Naruto and sakura... but i want it to be Naruto and hinata but it anit happening).<br>  3. so we could see 6 tails and the epics death of pain|`|z4NXrH8eaa	I think there is a good chance she is, even though I wish she wasn't.  We knew one of the original twelve genin would die, and I haven't heard any with proof that that isn't true. Sorry if it isn't.  And she is mostly a supporting character and I think she was meant to infuriate Naruto to kill Pain or something to that affect.  Hope she isn't though.|`|4VzoNHMxaa	she is so cute to die yet... i don't think she's dead gone already... after few more chapters maybe... but not till naruto gets his first kiss from her... if aint so then naruto would have no kiss at all :-P|`|zO6jqGCgaa	MEH i think naruto will have control over the 6tail form if u reamber the sharigan can control the kyubi and if u reamber far more back itachi gave naruto some of his power which is prob the power to control the kyubi prob 1 time use only with a ceartin period of time thats why itachi was weaken while fighting sasuke. another thing tobi is not obito i dont know where u guys really get that idea think really its been 14 yrs since obito died hes body would of decay and it could no way grow bigger use ur mind and eyes people plus tobi even says hes madara he even tells sasuke hes madara tobi is not obito god really people think i dout pain will be able to defeat the kyubi i think he has sasuke or madara hidden to control naruto when he goes into demon cloak state but then they find out he can control it cuz of itachi cuz itachi doesnt want konaha village to be destroyed thus leading to pains downfall because madar or sasuke cant control it cuz if u read nagato aka pain is really short on chakara hes used up most of it and if hinata doesnt die then naruto my kill her or naruto regains control after itachi sharigan wears off or something happen because of his oath not to rely on fox demon to defeat his enemys anymore and most likely sakura or yamoto might jump into to revert naruto back to normal because if sakura sees naruto with 6 tails which is more then last time when sakura tried to stop him or yamoto might see the densely control of chakra beam being shot up  and yamoto might try to stop naruto and ysunada h.w u spell comes in to heal naruto and ends up dieing from useing all her chakra to save naruto cuz those where narutos bones i think or kyubi not fully  mature bones cuz they where coming out of his body bleh 50/50 chance of hinata to die and if she does naruto would be uber depressed turn into another sasuke become stronger but this is probly close to the end because naruto wont die he still has to defeat madara to bring sasuke back and if naruto beats pain there goes akaski and i think all the kybui would go back to their bodys they never shows what happen to the body or the kyubi are all released which will cause total havoc or they do some major sealing spells on the statue thing to keep the tailed demons away for ever which most likely some boza will try to break the seal and try to control the power most likely dieing and then demons go on rampage but if naruto defeats pain not much left in story line except to bring sasuke back which there will probly be fillers to or extra stuff like battle between konaha and and pains village and konahamaru is prob gonna jump into narutos battle or see naruto and freak out and be scared of him theres alot of unpredictable thing but i listed most likly stuff to happen thanks for reading|`|AspDXIDlaa	NO FAWKING WAY!!!!!

8d9bafe53900ed8aed126e1212f02d87aa	I would have slapped him if I'd been Molly ... just for the sake of Melissa.  Plus, I would have said "and you are raising a son.  What a great example of character you are!"<br>  <br>  Cut right to the bone.<br>  <br>  I don't care that Melissa wasn't blind-sided. He didn't break up with her until the final show, which he didn't have to.  And then, went smooching with Molly.  Horrid!|`|kPokQHMLaa	I totally agree. I was hoping that Molly would have answered NO!, however, like a lot of ladies nowadays, she is desperate for marriage "at any cost!". I hurt for Melissa but I truly hope that they don't have another "Bachelorette" program featuring her like they did for Diana (who by the way, also ended up with a No Match, even after airing a show just for her).|`|Nr5uJ6zkaa	I never cared much for it. I don't watch "reality" t.v. it's all about Chowder :D|`|115ff89f311727857fc23b426639ff28aa	This was absolutely horrible.  I was devastated.  Jason portrayed himself as a kind, compassionate human being.  To see him act like this on television sets such a poor example in our crazy world.  I can't believe ABC would air this.  Are they not smart enough to know people will<br>  never watch this show again?  They portray it as reality t.v.  My thoughts are it is a soap opera.  Molly is ill to accept him.  She is going to get burned so badly.  I would not want my daughter to be with a man like this.<br>  He is the ultimate deceiver.  How awful to keep talking about his heart.<br>  Does he have a heart?  He thinks he did the right thing?  He has some issues, and in the end he will get paid back for this.  Anyone who leaves their son twice in a years time to go on a soap opera is not concerned for their child.  I hope he finds some religion in his life, and doesn't fake his true character any longer.  <br>  He is a 32 year old who should be totally ashamed of himself, admit it, and quit talking about his "heart."  I am amazed how cruel people can be. :(

fkIBZRmAaa	Personally I prefer Hinata and Naruto better than Naruto than Sakura, but Naruto and Sakura is okay. <br>  <br>  Anyway I'm confused if Hinata is alive or not I think she is because I read the new chapter this morning. If she is alive most likely she end up with Naruto considering Naruto went into a rage after she was supposedly killed. <br>  <br>  Naruto and Sakura is also possible but Naruto and Hinata is more likely to happen. I mean Naruto has liked Sakura for a while and Sakura just maybe might like Naruto. From Narutopedia: <br>  <br>  By Part II, when she learns the extent of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's relationship with Naruto, and the Akatsuki's goal to capture Naruto she has grown a desire to protect Naruto herself. Yamato has seen that Sakura feels something more for Naruto, however his analysis was interrupted by a waking Naruto, leaving at: "It's not what you do for Naruto that counts, but the strength of your feelings. Hmph, Sakura, I can tell just by looking at you..., in reality you..."[1]. Yamato was not the only one to realize Sakura's feelings for Naruto, Sai has also brought up the subject before on their way to retrieve Sasuke. Subconsciously, Sakura seems to be continually drawing herself closer to Naruto. <br>  <br>  She might like Naruto.<br>  <br>  I can't even predict the ending. That's up to the mangaka.|`|22tPNksKaa	I've hoped that he pairs w/ Hinata. Strangely enough, she sees to resemble his mother in appearance & hairstyle.<br>  <br>  Rock Lee would be a good match for Sakura, since he can really take a beating! lol & he had an "i love U" moment like Hinata did.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, she's just scuffed up & not mortally wounded. I'd hate for her to die a 'Geass Girl Death'. (Watch Code Geass to see what I mean) But w/ Pain running for his life like a whipped hound, there seems little danger to her. We can only pray.<br>  <br>  BTW, I miss "Inner Sakura"! OH YEAH!!!|`|mQhYZk2eaa	HINATA and she's not as snobbish as Sakura|`|hBEfrv23aa	Hm, I've FOREVER thought Naruto would end up with Sakura, but now it might be Hinata.<br>  <br>  I still think in the end he will be with Sakura. Sakura actually likes him now (in shippuuden) and he likes her. Plus Masashi Kishimoto compared Team 7 to Jiraiya, Tsunade, and Orochimaru.<br>  <br>  Sakura and Naruto are most definitely are like Tsunade and Jiraiya, and near when Jiraiya died it became kind of obvious Tsunade liked Jiraiya and he liked her back as well..<br>  <br>  <br>  I guess it just has to be a big surprise!|`|eOgoel33aa	it might be hinata since she just conffesed her freakin godamed love for him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TuT i dun really want either to be with him though!!! i looooooooove sasunaru hahahhaahh|`|ATKZ39Ceaa	I think he'll end up with Hinata now that she confessed!|`|kZrLIILnaa	HInata <br>  You can tell if you read the nauto manga where hinata tells naruto that she loves him when he is fighting pain. When pain stabs hinata, naruto goes crazy and turn to the 6 tailed. That is love.<br>  Sakura is more like a childish crush, Naruto, Sakura, and Suskae, are just like the 3 sanen. As you can see, Jeria liked Tsunada, but they never got together.|`|lnuVoAEBaa	Sorry about this but just as hinata confessed to naruto that she loved him she got killed by pain <br>  <br>  here is the link just keep on reading and you will get to the sad part<br>  <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/read/8/naruto/chapter.76298/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/read/...</a><br>  Wait actually I just saw this new chapter hinata might still live <br>  But why did Kakashi have to die<br>  NARUSASU ISN'T RIGHT HOW CAN PEOPLE MAKE THINGS UP LIKE THAT?!?|`|stYO4Q1Haa	Hinata is pretty much garenteed with her confession.

QGBYOLIxaa	Cancer/Taurus. I'm a Taurus and was with a Cancer for 10 months. It was one of the hardest 10 months I have ever had because he kept cheating on me and I kept falling for him and believing him. Then I finally got tired of it. But for those 10 months everyone would tell us to leave the other and we would go and do the complete opposite. Right now he lives in another state... (sigh) I'm suppose to move to that same state because I got accepted into a school. After not talking for about a month, he suddenly wrote me again last night. I fear seeing him because he knows my weaknesses. As long as he's not near me, I have control over my emotions, but as soon as i see him again it's always the same. We're like magnets. We become intimate and once we've done that it's like we own each other again. It's a non-ending vicious circle. <br>  <br>  I'm hoping this time apart has had enough time to kill his feelings for me, because it's helped settle mine a bit, but not enough. When he texted, I felt a range of emotions - resentment, anger, excitement, desire etc etc etc. It scared me to realize I can lose the control I somewhat regained, and imagining ending up in his arms again. He's the only Cancer I cannot get along with without fighting with him. Every other Cancer I know, it's hard to split us up because we have fun, laughs, and click instantly.|`|ZtnXNbaEaa	i've seen so many virgo and few libras clingy too... ex: my Bf is very clingy... generally people point on cancers but then... you dont care them and see.. they are the one who wanna get rid of you first... cancer get weak for the people who care them... and gives them double of it... clingy is the negative word given to persons who cannot forget the one who cared them easily... being a cancer i jus hate to be called so... coz i've valid feelings for a person and if i cannot get over them... people make it a negative trait and called them clingy? thats so ridiculous|`|ak610Npjaa	i think it pisces, cancer, taurus and some aquarius who cling.<br>  i think its also aquarius, gemini  and sag who will leave first|`|ztzEloj5aa	Cancers cling|`|d2uGruHiaa	I think for every sign of each element, there's at least one sign from each that clings to a relationship.<br>  <br>  Cancer and Capricorn are the ones i have the most knowledge in.<br>  <br>  I'm a Capricorn and if I think that person is right for me, I'll cling, but I'll try to not get too attached, but I end up anyways doing so. <br>  <br>  Since I'm a Capricorn with a Cancer rising, it's even more emotional for me to handle. I can't stand being alone. I really can't. <br>  <br>  In the long term- I would say a Leo. If you don't make their demands, they'll threaten to leave you.|`|oatLAxQQaa	i think it's pisces followed by taurus followed by capricorn followed by scorpio. pisces love deeply are ferociosly loyal but unfortunately too sensitive for the people of this planet to handle. but if you're a calm person and just accept them and not take their emotional eccentricities too seriously they're yours till the end of time. even if they leave you and  either of you try working things out pisceans'll definitely give it a second shot|`|g8QMrSzwaa	piscies can cling ....<br>  i feel caps can betray you completely or if u are married to them and then if they are not happy , they can betray you emotionally...<br>  <br>  aqua and gemini really clllllllllllllllllllliiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnn... when they like someone toooooooooooo much and its tough to get rid of them..|`|L39mQJYJaa	When an Aquarius have made up it's mind about someone it doesn't change it! And they are the hardest to get rid of along with the other Fixed signs. Scorpios can be even more clinging though, but they can also leave someone without any reason!|`|fOCpeazzaa	i would say definitely Cancer and Taurus<br>  <br>  and i agree with Gemini and Aquarius to leave first.|`|3J0utfJXaa	yeah cause im a cancer and i cling ^-^|`|RpR3MkH2aa	Yes ,it is Cancer that is the clingy one but if a Leo does not want to let go ...look out ! Same goes for a Scorpio.You have that right on Gemini and Aquarius !|`|n53BNB8taa	Taurus will cling because they like to be in solid relationships and once they make up their mind they won't let go of that person.<br>  <br>  Aries, gemini, or an Sag would break up the relationship and would leave.

7qr2GprBaa	A lot of people are hyper-sensitive to a close relationship between a father and daughter, because all the stories we hear about father's molesting their daughters. I'm not sure what you heard or read, but from what I've seen there's nothing abnormal about their relationship. <br>  <br>  My husband has a very close relationship with his daughter from his first marriage. I think it's great...they're like best friends. He told me his ex-girlfriend always made comments alluding to the idea that their relationship was "too close". However this woman had been molested by a relative, so I think that she was A: hyper-sensitive to the issue; and B: jealous of how close they are. <br>  <br>  I suppose I would think it was weird, too, except that my husband is just as close with his 2 sons. Just because she's a girl doesn't mean he shouldn't be close with her.|`|Gqirjnjqaa	she is a girl who is famous because her dad is a country star. she does not even have a good voice. even if she does, she is runing fer carrer at disnet.<br>  her point is to be a role model for kids, and i do not think that she is doing a good job at it. <br>  she is dating a guy who is 4 years olders then her. that is not seting agood example.|`|lQC5S37Paa	What do you mean? i love miley she is a great singer and everbody who hates her are just jealous she is just trying to be a teenager

I suppose we can now read a book by its cover.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes I will hear a track on the radio by a new artist and I like it, however, when I see them singing it, it can put me off the track, just because they are pig ugly. <br>  <br>  So yes I would say Video did kill the radio star, Buddy Holly would not have been famous today.<br>  <br>  <br>  Notice how our friends from the other side of the pond think it is "Radio Store"  that's cute. There is a web site dedicated to misheard lyrics. Some songs you can believe the words are different for decades it is a real surprise how many you can be wrong on.|`|v5XYluuFaa	Yes! :( <br>  <br>  <br>  I heard you on the wireless back in Fifty Two <br>  Lying awake intent at tuning in on you. <br>  If I was young it didn't stop you coming through. <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh-a oh <br>  <br>  <br>  They took the credit for your second symphony. <br>  Rewritten by machine and new technology, <br>  and now I understand the problems you can see. <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh-a oh <br>  <br>  I met your children <br>  Oh-a oh <br>  <br>  What did you tell them? <br>  Video killed the radio star. <br>  Video killed the radio star. <br>  <br>  <br>  Pictures came and broke your heart. <br>  Oh-a-a-a oh <br>  <br>  <br>  And now we meet in an abandoned studio. <br>  We hear the playback and it seems so long ago. <br>  And you remember the jingles used to go. <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh-a oh <br>  <br>  <br>  You were the first one. <br>  Oh-a oh <br>  <br>  <br>  You were the last one. <br>  <br>  <br>  Video killed the radio star. <br>  Video killed the radio star. <br>  In my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone to far <br>  Oh-a-aho oh, <br>  Oh-a-aho oh <br>  <br>  <br>  Video killed the radio star. <br>  Video killed the radio star. <br>  <br>  <br>  In my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone to far. <br>  Pictures came and broke your heart, put the blame on VTR. <br>  <br>  <br>  You are a radio star. <br>  You are a radio star. <br>  Video killed the radio star. <br>  Video killed the radio star. <br>  Video killed the radio star. <br>  Video killed the radio star. <br>  <br>  <br>  Video killed the radio star. (You are a radio star.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, yeah, video completely removed the need for music to be good to make it. People used to like songs because the beat was groovy, the singer had a good voice, etc. but now, they like the song because they got a good video or a memorable video. It really pisses me off, coz now stupid artists can make it in music while people who should be popular get cast off because their video aint good enough! Artists depend more on image than on talent these days, its depressing.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Yes. Then Internet killed the Video Star.|`|5CMQbRteaa	Ummm. I think its STORE|`|ZaTLsifIaa	good question. i'm gonna guess and say it did, because maybe he was really ugly and the video of him totally killed the radio version of him for his viewers.|`|coMusueeaa	i always thought it was radio STORE but clearrly i am wrong, but yeah it dummied the radio STAR|`|WNzBmpyraa	With some videos, yes...but with others I actually prefer to watch the video than just listening to the words of a song.|`|Ls93X4ufaa	It did, and now digital music is going to kill the record industry.|`|DEHBIqJraa	it sure did first ever song on mtv .buggles rock!|`|3jrSCkzqaa	yes it fell on his head from an upstairs window|`|ZDjmDuuyaa	It sure did|`|OrPz8Zhoaa	im my mind<br>  and in my car<br>  yes they did<br>  xDDDDD

Chad Smith claims that the band went back into the studio last September, but John Frusciante says RHCP has no plans currently to create a new album. In the meantime, you can check out John's new solo album 'The Empryean', which was released in January. It's awesome!<br>  <br>  Hopefully they really do get back into the studio and release an album by next year! They'll probably go on tour after that. So you'll have to wait until at least 2010 for their next tour.|`|ZA8mgfwyaa	it's anyones guess really, could be a few months, could be a few years, they've been together so long, and done so much and go so popular, they need to cool off and do their own thing for a while, <br>  <br>  in the meantime, check out chad's other band, and more so than anything buy every single solo album john has ever released, some even have appearences by flea and chad, but if you havent heard his solo stuff, you havent lived, Shadow's Collide With People is a great album,  really some varied styles from weird keyboard stuff to even kind poppy rock stuff.|`|PSY5G9tTaa	(Nice name ``^.^-)<br>  <br>  I think they just ended a tour.

hGTuCqeEaa	I used to use the ZZ reeds, but switched to LaVoz a while back; these like the ZZ's are V-cut reeds, but the quality seems as consistent as those of the ZZ at a lower price point.<br>  The flow packing should help the life of the reed since it keeps the reed at constant humidity until the package is opened. I find that regardless of brand or cut (V or filed) the most common weakness of reeds is a warped table which does not allow for a strong seal between the reed and the mouthpiece table. Mild sanding of the underside of the reed with a fine grained (minimum 250 grains per inch) sandpaper on a hard, flat surface will cure this problem- just be careful not to overdo it and make the reed too soft. There are manufactured reed preparing devices (I own one made by Vandoren) that would help you to do this quickly; I've turned many seemingly irredeemable reeds into reeds that work well in this manner.|`|FME726Eaaa	I play bari sax and use Vandoren 3 reeds, but I use the regular concert reeds. I haven't noticed any difference in the reed, but maybe the change is only in ZZ reeds.
QeX89rP2aa	get together with some friends. like if i made a webshow with my friends it would be hilarious because we are so random. but just do stuff that comes naturally, dont force comedy because then it isnt funny.|`|rumtF3djaa	What type of web show? If you want to do comedy, think of pranks and catch em' on tape. Also, you can show funny videos from online (like viral videos)|`|hlUOTUohaa	watch icarly:)<br>  <br>  but dont completely steal their ideas. <br>  <br>  watch it as an inspiration.
t25zrCTraa	Yea and No.<br>  <br>  The limit. That's what I'll clarify. Your ear drum itself wont be ruptured by head phones. You'd have to make them louder that a gun shot. If your ears aren't ringing then your eardrum isn't even the slightest bit close to being ruptured. <br>  <br>  But the Cochlea on the other hand is a different story as it is the object that directly translates vibrations into brain signals. It has little hairs inside that take that vibration and large noises mess those irreplaceable hairs up.<br>  <br>  Frequency has nothing to do with it here, or period. Damage to the ears come from decibels, or the amplitude of the sound waves. That is what will damage your ears. <br>  <br>  If you notice that the high hat or any hissing hurts, your stuff is to loud. It's a high freq but it's really the volume giving your ear to much powerful vibration at once.<br>  <br>  I'm a drum and Bass Addict so I know what you're going through. Turn the volume down to a comfortable level. <br>  <br>  I'm sure when your favorite song comes you'll turn it back up but just know that although using headphones won't end your ears over one loud tune as they are too weak, they can damage it over the years.|`|YbyNWdDmaa	no way.<br>  <br>  put it this way.<br>  i work in a music venue and we have to wear earplugs to every show because the decibels are so high. <br>  but if youre at home and music is blaring out, as long as it's at a comfortable volume, you will be fine. bass itself doesnt make the difference, though it probably feels like it does because you can sort of feel it, right? <br>  <br>  also, if youre playing music on your ipod, and you turn it right up, that can seriously damage your hearing..youre supposed to keep it at about three quarters of the way high. is that a good indicator?<br>  happy listening :)<br>  LJ|`|BlA60kDVaa	Yes.  Protect your ears, you will regret it if you damage them!|`|AA11822515	It's not likely unless you're going to clubs every night and standing next to the speakers. Tinnitus is no joke though.<br>  <br>  Moderate home listening won't cause you a problem.

This picture was on the TV Land website, but credited the picture from another website called Getty Images. I looked up the picture on that website and you get a better look at it. The names of the brothers is wrong, though. It says that Randy is in the back, but that's actually Jimmy. Randy is on the far left, followed by Jermaine, Tito, Michael and Marlon. They have a "Jackie" listed, but there was no brother named Jackie...I think they were thinking of Jimmy, but Jimmy was the youngest and didn't perform with the rest of the group.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Opps! My mistake--the names are correct. I was thinking of the Osmond Brothers--the littlest brother was Jimmy.

ObeBvtzgaa	No, I'm pretty sure Gibson makes all their guitars in the USA.<br>  I haven't played the replica you're talking about, but I doubt it really compares to the original that is thousands of dollars more.<br>  I have a Gibson Les Paul and it is the best guitar I've ever played by far, and I've tried Stratocasters, RR24M's, Ibanez, and some others. Not to say all those are lesser in quality, that is also preference, but Gibsons are definitely very well made guitars, and the only negative that comes to mind is the weight of them which really doesn't even bother me.<br>  I would look into more specifics about the guitars first and compare them online. For example, compare the woods used on each part of it, the type of pickups, the size neck, etc.<br>  Good luck with whichever you pick.|`|htxwTAAQaa	Absolutely.  You might not get Gibson quality, but like you said, it's a guitar, it plays music.  People focus on brand name far too much.  After all, the sound of the guitar depends on who's playing it, right?|`|DnWsMhwLaa	cheap fake brand chinese guitars? don't you know your music could get salmonella poisoning like that?|`|995e987f826f3705764c11398ede5b26aa	damn it!! they have a rickenbacker section,but nothing in it....ive been trying to find a 4001-4003 copy for years now..haha,<br>  im all about copies....swap out the electronics, strings,and proper set-up....and you can have a sweet sounding guitar...|`|SkRJNhuCaa	No, Chinese fakes (which these are) are utter rubbish.<br>  They can be so cheap because they:<br>  1) don't use quality materials (most likely the body is from cheap pine multiplex board or worse, MDF, for example)<br>  2) use Chinese prison labour (in other words, slave labour)<br>  3) don't pay royalties for using trademarked shapes and names.<br>  <br>  And not only that, by buying one you're breaking the law.<br>  Importing fake brand items (and you will be the importer) is illegal. It can lead to big fines, will get the goods impounded and destroyed on top of those fines, and for repeat offenders can lead to prison sentences of several years.<br>  <br>  Buy an Epiphone LP instead if you want an LP. They're not much more expensive.<br>  <br>  Gibson builds everything in the USA.<br>  Epiphone (Gibson's cheaper offshoot) produces some things in China, others in Korea.
i5xByO9naa	Since movies about african american, indians, jews and others have been made, I think that they should make a movie about troubled latino teens that live in the slums of south central. By asking questions about there relationship with parents, there social life and if there involved maybe in a gang, perhaps it will help people understand  our way of lifestyle and that before judging once again, they should know that not everyone in South Central L.A is the same.   <br>  <br>  Proud to be an Educated Chicana.

It still holds up as a great movie today, whereas Breakfast Club is a bit dated. Plus, it spawned 2 great sequels.<br>  <br>  I love Teen Wolf (I was a bit of a Michael J Fox fan in those days) and the Color Purple as well though.<br>  <br>  But Fright Night gave me nightmares for weeks!|`|PFghQIq6aa	Back To The Future. Made Michael J. Fox a star 3x's over, not to mention his stint on Family Ties, plus boatloads of movies & his other sitcom Spin City....Breakfast Club is a cult classic along with Weird Science. Both have Anthony Michael Hall who turned from a skinny wimp to pumped up making that first appearance in Edward Scissorhands....I could go on & on....|`|DS33Wl4waa	Back to the Future, Honorable mention: Breakfast Club|`|ba78OLcraa	either Back to the Future or the Breakfast Club<br>  both are serious classics<br>  i mean, if you haven't seen them, then you are a major big time freakazoid.|`|PeRMKqTpaa	The Breakfast Club!

I'm also a Met Guild member, even though I live in LA and have never been to a live performance at the MET.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm working tomorrow. Being self-employed, I take the jobs as they come along. However, my radio will be on K-USC for the live broadcast and I'll follow as much of it as possible.<br>  <br>  Locally, at least here in LA, they also do re-broadcast of the broadcast from the week before on Saturday evenings:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/season/single/reserve.aspx?perf=9914" rel="nofollow">http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/s...</a><br>  <br>  So next week I'll be able to hear the full broadcast without having to worry about re-wiring conduits.|`|sc4BtGxGaa	No - I am going to be in NYC tomorrow for my husband's coaching, but last week we saw Il Torvatore live.  We are Met Guild members, and as soon as it gets quiet around here, I need to learn how to connect my laptop to my flatscreen/hometheater, since we can get those SAME Met operas at home, by pay-per-view thru their site, or subscription.    We live less than 100 miles from NYC, so they do NOT show those films in theaters near us - like blacking out a ballgame, I guess!.  The ones available on the site are not just current, but historic - I have advised lots of people to do this, and have not done it yet myself!  Got all the cables, etc. - had tix for Eugene Onegin, gave them up (knee surgery and rehab) went to  Il Trovatore with a cane and lots of drugs ( . . .) and really should figure this out soon - I could be enjoying it here at home - big burgundy leather couch, single-malt Scotch, the man I love - and it would not cost me $42 to park the car (seriously!)<br>  <br>  Enjoy Madama B.  Maybe *un bel di* I'll get my cables connected!<br>  <br>  Added - <br>  <br>  OK, just got home - listened to a chunk of this in the car, changing FM stations as I went north.  I am still recovering from whiplash - not from anything automotive, but from being wobbled back and forth by Racette's VIBRATO!  This  voice is a little to wide, warm, and wobbly for this role.  I have heard her in Peter Grimes - a much better fit - and some other thing I cannot pinpoint right now.  Hey - I also heard (recording) Monserrat Caballe sing Salome - I do not want to even THINK about the Dance of the 7 Veils . . at least vocally it was more convincing.    Gotta get those cables connected . . .|`|AA12376180	I will confess I am not an opera buff. My brother was an opera singer however I drifted to the piano. I do attend an opera occasionally and have practically every opera in my record collection, but I listen mostly to instrumental. Just not my thing I guess.<br>  <br>  Hafwen wishes she was here in the US and I wish I was down under, perhaps we can trade houses for awhile. I think there was a fairly recent movie about two people temporarily house swapping. I heard it was a great movie. Missed that one too. I need to get out more I think.|`|PS0oSoXFaa	No... I wish I didn't live in such a god-forsaken little town! We're famous for two things- for censoring Fahrenheit 9/11 when it came out, and for a wrecking ball getting loose and tearing down main street, destroying about fifteen cars. No joke!

QXl6GdNBaa	I thought He's Just Not That Into You was a straight-up "chick flick," or a more polite term, romantic comedy. If you're into those type of movies, then see it.<br>  <br>  I'm seeing Watchmen on Sunday, and honestly, I can't wait. It's just under three hours in running time, but it looks fantastic.<br>  <br>  It's all up to your matter of interests.|`|STgaknBIaa	watchmen and ive never read a comic book in my life.
adLSRFrZaa	My parents and I always had very different taste in music.  Neither one of my parents really like hard rock.  I pretty much forged my own musical identity starting around age fifteen.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	Not really, my parents love country music and I am a rocker girl for the most part.  However, I am partial to some of the old country music and some of it that I listened to growing up in the 80s and 90s.  You couldn't pay me to listen to today's country music.|`|81c2tGriaa	I really don't listen to any of the stuff my parents do...but my mom did get me into John Mayer, she used to listen to it in the car all the time|`|k7jGZydJaa	I'm still a kid, but they listen to Fergie and Plain White T's.<br>  <br>  I found a couple Depeche Mode songs on my mom's iPod though. I stole them from her. I actually got into rock music from playing video games.|`|DcoSZDwQaa	Yes, to a certain extent. I got my love of Pink Floyd and country music from my mom, but otherwise we've got different tastes.|`|oWJU0ky4aa	Sometimes, I listen to music from 50's|`|ukRpBJ6Daa	well, my parents listen to beethoven and stuff<br>  <br>  sooo the answer would be....<br>  <br>  <br>  No.<br>  <br>  :D|`|NVaNSxTVaa	no got my own style|`|OGpB2dKHaa	Yes and No.  My mom introduced me to Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, ZZ Top, The Beatles, and others at a relatively young age.  I still listen to those bands.<br>  <br>  My father on the other hand... not so much.  I do appreciate his love for Classical music (1812 Overture, Holst, ETC)  But his popular music tastes are terrible in my opinion for the most part...  But, at the same time, I listen to Hard Rock/Metal constantly, and he thinks my tastes are lacking... well taste.|`|ShOxzDfIaa	Well im not exactly adult yet but NOWAY!! <br>  My parents have the most horrible taste in music!!<br>  My dad listens to jazz/swing and my mum listens to pop.<br>  My whole family has different taste in music. <br>  My brothers into rap. Sisters into RnB. and my other brothers to young to know what he likes.|`|FpqYrDoLaa	Yes - I like ELO, Supertramp and Paul Simon. Sames LPs that my parents used to play.|`|9FclCgcbaa	..not really.<br>  except The Clash.

It is where I get my undieing love of jazz and blues, plus they guided me to many of the fundemental bands that create my love of rock and roll.|`|xwD8PUFlaa	I enjoy my parents music more then they do, my mum thinks theirs something wrong with me.|`|702f83b079a03568e52b59e470049ba4aa	yes it did, I enjoy jazz a great deal.

AA11442722	Inspiration has to be something that touches you. Maybe mouse racing to you is a sentimental sport, maybe it's lost love, whatever. What is inspirational to me isn't necessarily inspirational to me.  <br>  <br>  Depression really does help bring the muse though. Most of my best tunes were written in a deep funk. They may not sound depressing but the depression itself was what brought the muse to me that day. I've got one ex-girlfriend who has a knack for bringing depression to my doorstep LOL. I think I'm going to rename her musebringer :) <br>  <br>  So look into what makes you sad. Drop into the spiral, let the whirlpool take hold of you and follow it down to those black depths and pour that out into your pen. Play music that is especially depressing or melocholoy for you. <br>  <br>  Maybe it's anger you seek, do it the same way but instead build up that rage and pour it out your pen.<br>  <br>  Remember the emotion you use to reach your muse is not necessarily the emotional tone that what you write will be. You could be depressed to the point of wanting to off yourself and write the most uplifting words ever. You could be furious with the world and write something sad or sad and write something angry. <br>  <br>  Another point to chew on. Some days no matter what you do, your muse is off throwing dice somewhere or sleeping in. She just won't visit and you can't force her to come. You can have the right emotions, great intensity, you can close off the world, play the best music that's conductive to your creativity and still she won't come. Best bet is to get sleepy then, my muse LOVES to visit me when all I want is to get some sleep. Sometimes even that don't work. Just shrug it off, and do something else. It'll happen. Sometimes for a while. Sometimes what your writing needs to sit around a bit and brew before it's ready to come out. You can feel it there, feel it grow but till it's ready to be born it's not going anywhere. Force it out before it's ready and you'll destroy that idea. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit.|`|qif1TQtnaa	You don't need inspiration. A true lyricist can sit down and pour out his heart.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Yeah, hey!

e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	It's called ego. Everyone wants to think that they're smarter, stronger, taller, better looking, whatever than the average person. I know I'm not exceptionally smart, but I have the potential to do (but most people I know think of me as smart). I took an IQ test a couple years ago and scored 161. What's really bad is that I had the potential to get into any Ivy League school I wanted, but I just coasted through high school without even attempting to apply myself, but still got into Penn State (a great school), and for the first three years coasted through Penn State. But then I started applying myself and started seeing some amazing results.|`|4T9fZzITaa	i get what you're saying.<br>  i believe everybody knows some things others dont useless things or not. everybody has different smarts so i think everybody is smart & that can be street smart or book smart. but pple who openly express being "above the average" ... i mean cmon most likely they are insecure <br>  or arrogant/ignorant. <br>  or..all three|`|W1xs3vYBaa	You're probably right, especially on yahoo answers. <br>  <br>  Very few people I know will bring up IQ out of the blue, and I know that in my real life I dislike giving a number. There is nothing to be gained other than stigma once you put a number out there.<br>  <br>  However, in the world of the web the ambiguity means that people can say it without stigma, and it also means that some people will try to create a fantasy life where they are X, Y and Z. Usually people want to be smart, so they inflate numbers, take online test scores or make up a high mark. <br>  <br>  I don't really understand the rational around this. The process for testing someone's IQ has been shown to be extremely flawed. I've had it done legitimately throughout my life, and it did help me understand how I think and was useful information so that I could learn how to best study, but when they are used to compare to others the score becomes inappropriate. <br>  <br>  A high IQ score does not mean a person will become innovative or successful, and I too wish people would stop using them as some sort of badge. I'm much prouder of a paper I wrote than an arbitrary number assigned to me through a quack test.|`|7DdH4dDZaa	And I care why?|`|go6sqAtKaa	Aghhhhh I totally agree with you =)|`|wdLzpIAiaa	your boyfriend..??|`|JIMO562daa	slow down, Billy.<br>  remember that every other person you touch is an idiot.<br>  and besides, if we Americans all claim to be above average, just in general, then why are we not the "smartest" nation in the world.

RLs0skyNaa	4 for u<br>  <br>  A man told the ringmaster that he was interested in joining the circus as a lion tamer. The ringmaster asked if he had any experience<br>  <br>  The man said, "Why, yes. My father was one of the most famous lion tamers in the world, and he taught me everything he knew."<br>  <br>  "Really?" said the ringmaster. "Did he teach you how to make a lion jump through a flaming hoop?"<br>  <br>  "Yes he did," the man replied.<br>  <br>  "And did he teach you how to have six lions form a pyramid?"<br>  <br>  "Yes he did," the man replied.<br>  <br>  "And have you ever stuck your head in a lion's mouth?"<br>  <br>  "Just once," the man replied.<br>  <br>  The ringmaster asked, "Why only once?"<br>  <br>  The man said, "I was looking for my father."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2. A driver is pulled over by a policeman. The police man approaches the driver's door....<br>  <br>  "Is there a problem Officer?"<br>  <br>  The policeman says, "Sir, you were speeding. Can I see your licence please?"<br>  <br>  The driver responds, "I'd give it to you but I don't have one."<br>  <br>  "You don't have one?"<br>  <br>  The man responds, "I lost it four times for drink driving."<br>  <br>  The policeman is shocked. "I see. Can I see your vehicle registration papers please?"<br>  <br>  "I'm sorry, I can't do that."<br>  <br>  The policeman says, "Why not?"<br>  <br>  "I stole this car."<br>  <br>  The officer says, "Stole it?"<br>  <br>  The man says, "Yes, and I killed the owner."<br>  <br>  At this point the officer is getting irate. "You what!?"<br>  <br>  "She's in the boot if you want to see."<br>  <br>  The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun.<br>  <br>  The senior officer says "Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please!"<br>  <br>  The man steps out of his vehicle. "Is there a problem sir?"<br>  <br>  "One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner."<br>  <br>  "Murdered the owner?"<br>  <br>  The officer responds, "Yes, could you please open the boot of your car please?"<br>  <br>  The man opens the boot, revealing nothing but an empty boot.<br>  <br>  The officer says, "Is this your car sir?"<br>  <br>  The man says "Yes," and hands over the registration papers.<br>  <br>  The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. "One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving license."<br>  <br>  The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. "Thank you sir, one of my officers told me you didn't have a license, stole this car, and murdered the owner."<br>  <br>  The man replies, "I bet you he's lying by telling you I was speeding, too!"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  3. A husband and wife are traveling by car from Key West to Boston. After almost twenty-four hours on the road, they're too tired to continue, and they decide to stop for a rest.<br>  <br>  They stop at a nice hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep for four hours and then get back on the road. When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350.<br>  <br>  The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk although it's a nice hotel, the rooms certainly aren't worth $350.<br>  <br>  When the clerk tells him $350 is the standard rate, the man insists on speaking to the Manager.<br>  <br>  The Manager appears, listens to the man, and then explains that the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that was available for the husband and wife to use.<br>  <br>  "But we didn't use them," the man complains.<br>  <br>  "Well, they are here, and you could have," explains the Manager.<br>  <br>  He goes on to explain they could have taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous. "The best entertainers from New York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here," the Manager says.<br>  <br>  "But we didn't go to any of those shows, "complains the man again.<br>  <br>  "Well, we have them, and you could have," the Manager replies.<br>  <br>  No matter what facility the Manager mentions, the man replies, "But we didn't use it!"<br>  <br>  The Manager is unmoved, and eventually the man gives up and agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the Manager.<br>  <br>  The Manager is surprised when he looks at the check. "But sir," he says, this check is only made out for $50."<br>  <br>  "That's correct," says the man. "I charged you $300 for sleeping with my wife."<br>  <br>  "But I didn't!" exclaims the Manager.<br>  <br>  "Well, too bad," the man replies. "She was here and you could have."<br>  <br>  4.

A man walks into a bar with a monkey on his shoulder.  The bartender asks,"Is that monkey goin' ta be any trouble?" and the man says no he won't and any trouble he causes i'll pay for.  <br>  <br>  So the monkey goes down the bar and drinks out of everybody's drinks, so the man orders a round for the house.<br>  <br>  Well, then themonkey goes to the pool tables and eats the cue ball, and the bartender says,"Alright, that's it.  It'll be $100 for a new set of cue balls and the round for the house.  Don't come back until that monkey's learned to behave."  So the man throws a hundred on the table, says keep the change, and walks out.<br>  <br>  Well, about two weeks later, the man walks in and the bartender asks,"Is that monkey gonna behave?" and the man tells the bartender he learned his lesson and that it wouldn't happen again.<br>  <br>  So the monkey goes to the fruit tray, where all of the lemon oranges and lemons and cherries are.  Well, the monkey picks up a cherry, sticks it in his butt, pull it out, and eats it.  So the bartender says,"Man, that's disgusting. What have you been teaching that monkey?"<br>  <br>  And the man says,"Well, ever since the cue ball incident, the monkey has always measured things."|`|DP8mnHIraa	oops i nearly <br>  spat my drink out<br>  lmaorof <br>  good one <br>  x x x|`|IkYQ6KP2aa	ah that was good lol i'll tell that to everyone!!
Apisf1gAaa	Honestly, Dr. Manhattan is more graphic than that Sex scene. It's kind of dragged out, though. You get like one second of boob, and then a lot of cheesy sex. I mean, it's graphic but not horrendously so. Be more worried about good old Doc being naked half the movie.|`|JmHBplRIaa	I've only read the graphic novel and it wasn't too bad for nudity, I suppose. I mean, there was some boobs here and there (mostly when Rorshach is walking through the streets and he gets propositioned by hookers), the occasional butt-crack (fat people and also in the Comedian-Sally attempted rape scene) but the scene between Dan and Laurie, I recall, was drawn from side-on perspective so their limbs pretty much covered all their bits. <br>  <br>  My friend went to go see it, she said that the nudity was quite graphic (she didn't really go into detail about it but I think she mentioned something about Dr. Manhattan's wang) and over here in the UK it has an 18 certificate so I'm assuming it has done something to warrant it. However, the trailer warns of bloody violence and not nudity so I'm not entirely sure how bad it'll be. Often a combination of all the taboo things result in an 18 ... eh, now I'm side-tracking.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope you enjoy your film!|`|NGFzCWTBaa	theres ALOT of nudity in the movie<br>  i would say the sex scene is pretty graphic

His songs won't make the pop charts, but that's not why he does it anyway! :)<br>  <br>  100 Years<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmoE8_U-JTw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmoE8_U-J...</a><br>  <br>  World<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-kpR32B-Uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-kpR32B-...</a><br>  <br>  The Riddle<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgNPGBp4Ygg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgNPGBp4Y...</a><br>  <br>  Freedom Never Cries<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzmmQ74LzjU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzmmQ74Lz...</a>|`|1263731b76a5881b98bbd0aacec9a2cdaa	Coldplay has some really good, thought-provoking lyrics, especially in such songs as "Life in Technicolor II," "Glass of Water," "Clocks," "Lost," "Violet Hill," "Yes," and "Viva La Vida." (There are many others, of course!) I also like Gorillaz, especially "Feel Good Inc," "El Manana," "Every Planet We Reach is Dead," and "Demon Days," though their lyrics can be cryptic. Rocco Deluca and the Burden also has some thought-provoking lyrics in songs such as "Colorful," "Speak to Me," and "Save Yourself." Lastly, Enya's vocal music possesses a near poetic quality that I think anyone would enjoy. Hope you can find some tunes you like! :)|`|QZ4P8KYeaa	Rise Againist-Swing Life Away<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0FM-cAVj8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0FM-cAV...</a>
sfofXBg0aa	So many artists are more famous than their talent entitles them because the importance of image and sponsorship is unfortunately considered over musical skills.<br>  <br>  Good Image, good sponsor:<br>  Take the Jonas Brothers.  Good image, sponsored by Disney, selling millions.<br>  <br>  Bad image, good sponser:<br>  People stopped listening to Chris Brown and Britney Spears because of their image issues.<br>  <br>  Good image, bad sponsor:<br>  And amazing artists don't break it into the business because they're not backed by the big companies.|`|2LpWgU20aa	i tottally agree with you! there is no definition of good music, it all depends on the peoples tastes and it really bothers me when people discriminate against my favorite bands---chances are they never really gave it a listen before. but either way ignore the haters and keep on listening to whoever you want!|`|LRLu1ofNaa	Why are you acting like everyone does this?|`|2ab909820942304668ac078e08751277aa	people stay hating the jonas brothers because of their fame versus their musical ability. i'm not saying they make bad music, but there are definitely artists wayyy better out there who aren't nearly as famous as the jonas brothers are. and people who answer these questions saying they hate the jonas brothers is because the recognize this, and are frustrated that the majority of jonas fans dont recognize this.<br>  im not saying that you in particular don't recognize this, its just the general vibe that jonas brothers fans tend to give off.|`|OEaqkDdVaa	Exactly exactly exactly.<br>  <br>  This is what I try to tell people.

usxeet5vaa	Actually, there are! The Pink Panther 2 is still in theatres, Twilight is actually a good movie for a family for ages 10 and up, and The Bride Wars was good. <br>  <br>  But, actually, the more I think about it, you are actually right! I guess the movie makers are way out of it. but, I guess that they do have their phases. It'll come in and out, with good and bad movies. For sure, there will have to be a good family movie come out in a bout a year. <br>  <br>  But for now, all I do is switch on the cable TV or rent a movie. There's also the internet, but you have to have a special software for that, otherwise its illegal. There are some good old movies that are great! <br>  <br>  Check some out on google! <br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|PFghQIq6aa	The reason may be that it's hard to make kids sit in a theater. It's not their comfort zone. They're not at home. Then there's the munchies they may not get at home so they want them even more so that means kids might holler until they get some. Then there's the bathroom issues. Plus the messes that can be made with spilled popcorn, drinks, more trips back & forth. Other parents scolding their kids for the above & add talking to it... It's a dream come true movie experience...|`|2p5VsmZhaa	Modern society is the problem. I'm part of it. I like violent movies or movies with action.|`|b3430f029620f887c40c8446bb254292aa	dude you should totally get irreversible<br>  such a sweet kids movie<br>  you'll love it|`|87CAVhs2aa	I think they should put Ferris Bueller and The Beatles back in theaters.<br>  <br>  But that's just me.
3d2a88d2cde886130855c6bf27ceae48aa	Because when a character is drawn with five fingers, the hands look crowded on screen. Four fingers per hand looks proportional.|`|22tPNksKaa	Generally because it's easier. Easier=cheaper.<br>  <br>  But Japanese Anime frequently goes through the extra expense to make a superior product. Watch any 10 Anime & compare them to any 10 US cartoons. notice the finger count. as well as the details of the environment. And the storylines/ dialogue. American animation fails on every level in terms of quality. Compare Pixar CGI to Final Fantasy Advent Children. No Contest!<br>  <br>  Although adult cartoons. South Park Simpsons Venture Bros. are also poorly drawn, they are parody & comedy. And BRILLIANTLY written. <br>  <br>  But in the US, Products for kids=Crappy Products as a matter of Principle! Just try watching Spongebob or Chowder. You'll be swallowing rat poison & washing it down w/ drain cleaner by the first commercial break!|`|RetVJj8Oaa	<a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/20050124.html">http://ask.yahoo.com/20050124.html</a><br>  <br>  The answer to this one is pretty straightforward -- it's easier to draw and animate four fingers than five. <br>  The average cartoon short requires 50,000 drawings. If you're working with a five-fingered character, drawing each digit really adds up in terms of time and money. But if your character has four fingers on each hand instead of five, that's 100,000 fewer digits to sketch. Or as one site puts it, it's "accountant-based thinking that forces so many cartoon characters to go through life with only four fingers." <br>  <br>  Two of the earliest animated characters, Felix the Cat and Mickey Mouse, were both drawn with four "fingers" per "hand," and later characters generally followed suit. But as this 'toon site states, "There's no cartoon bible that you can consult that states that all characters have four fingers."|`|GInSlNYcaa	I hear it's easier to draw four fingers than five.

GM8xyco0aa	Mysto & Pizzi - Somebody's Watching Me
ryLbKatoaa	It doesn't seem like she's a lesbian so much as she's transgendered. Basically, she's only a girl in body. In her mind, though, she's a boy. Or both. Or neither. It can get complicated. But I wouldn't call her a lesbian per say. She might be bi. Or might like girls and consider herself straight, because she's a man inside. Or she might like guys and be straight or even consider herself gay. It all depends on the person. <br>  <br>  But yeah, transgendered people can get confusing. I, personally, think it's kinda hot, but there are others who can get intimidated or freaked out by the idea. I suggest talking to her about it, because there are honestly no real clear "symptoms". Some transgendered people are very good at remaining undercover and some non-transgendered people just like acting like the opposite gender.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also, about AX, it's incredibly common for girls to "crossplay" or dress up as a male character at anime conventions. It honestly doesn't mean anything. However, if she classifies as an "otaku" (super obsessed anime fan), the odds are probably a little higher that she's transgender, bi, or lesbian. About 99% of all otaku I know are gay, bi or bi-curious, lesbian, or transgendered, and most of the rest are straight people who accept them. But it's honestly a little more complicated than that. I think you should just ask her. Well, as long as you're the accepting sort. If not, then drop it.

UOLtJocMaa	Well you have answered your own question, I believe.  I am not sure if she has a modelmayhem account.  She is definitely in her early 20s, her name is Brittany E but they dont give any other information than that.  She has appeared in several videos and is from the Atlanta area.  Maybe find out her management company first and see if they have a site which would give you more info.  Hope this helps.

5CaUKakNaa	I think it can, and even in a good way! To feel a emotion stronger than anything else, and have simple, mindless thoughts of "what if i'm doing something wrong", "do they still love me?", "why me?", "they deserve better." These thoughts of love and devotion show how badly love can cause pain! But it is most defiantly a good thing. It shows that no matter the outcome, your love will and can prevail in horrible situations. <br>  Ultimately it also shows how people hurt themselves. Going against that, it shows that the relationship is built on false truths. With doubts, how can your love grow stronger? To confide in each other, to trust and guide one another is phenomenal! Never-the-less, love is still there no matter the quantity. <br>  I don't believe it to be ridiculous. I see it as passion and unwillingness.|`|b9bb3038c98bd411a4615dc47e243648aa	good song but <br>  yes i do agree<br>  maybe it is like the heartbreak and pain of that <br>  is almost worth the feeling of when you are in love<br>  but idk?|`|NVaNSxTVaa	nope|`|Yc9uPziVaa	it sends the message to be masochistic|`|AA10041941	obviously sadistic..but thats the state of the world today..love shouldn't hurt and if its real it would never hurt only when that person is away. such a deep subject hard to type all I want to on this.. so I will just say love DOES not hurt!

The term "Alabama" originated from a lesser known, but crucial additional practice that involves "Porky Piggin'" the female who has recieved the Hot Pocket. In Alabama, you see, good old redneck boys, when bored, would **** pig troughs or large, wet piles of mud. To properly perform the Porky Piggin' follow-up procedure, one must take a massive **** onto the vagina WITHOUT spreading the lips. This creates a core that enters the woman, and then dregs that explode out all over her. By randomly stabbing with the cock, one will successfully Porky Piggin' the girl... repeating, naturally, the action that would normally be associated with screwing a pile of mud or animal trough.<br>  Yeah boy, I gave her a good ole Alabama Hot Pocket. What? No **** I Porky Piggin'd that ****. <br>  <br>  or a more simple:<br>  This is when a man shits in a womans vagina and then ***** her while the poop is still in the vagina.<br>  Jason gave Tak an Alabama Hot Pocket and it took her 3 weeks to clean it out.|`|MVCKkQvraa	well i think this question will get deleted because some people will put some nasty stuff on here but I am going to answer the question.<br>  Nastiest thing today, not as bad as other days.

What your looking for is a hyperlink, that has what you want on it. When you find it you put in into your address bar (sometimes there will be a direct clickable link) anyways follow what is being given to you, click on what you want to download, and being sure not to click on adverts for other payable sites that you can rapidshare with. You will hopefull get to a screen with 2 animations of a sppedometer, click on the one that says free user. (the file you want should be listed above). you then have to wait for like a minute. then click the big download button. Once the download is completed you should have a folder that contains all the tracks with names, and possabliy album art work.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|HA3CUl0Jaa	Music is art.

Y1aAGPURaa	They and sooo funny!!!   Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  Recently, I was diagnosed with A.A.A.D.D. - (Age Activated Attention Deficit Disorder).  <br>  <br>  This is how it manifests: <br>  <br>  I decide to water my garden.<br>  <br>  As I turn on the hose in the driveway, I look over at my car and decide it needs washing. <br>  <br>  As I start toward the garage, I notice mail on the porch table that I brought up from the post box earlier.<br>  <br>  I decide to go through the post before I wash the car.<br>  <br>  I lay my car keys on the table, put the junk mail in the rubbish bin under the table, and notice that the bin is full.<br>  <br>  So, I decide to put the bills back on the table and take out the rubbish first. <br>  <br>  But then I think, since I'm going to be near the postbox when I take out the rubbish anyway, I may as well pay the bills first. <br>  <br>  I take my cheque book off the table, and see that there is only one cheque left.<br>  <br>  My extra cheque book is in my desk in the study, So I go inside the house to my desk where I find the cup of coffee I'd been drinking.<br>  <br>  I'm going to look for my cheque book, but first I need to push the coffee aside So that I don't accidentally knock it over.<br>  <br>  The Coffee is getting cold, and I decide to make another cup.<br>  <br>  As I head toward the kitchen with the cold coffee, a vase of flowers on the shelf catches my eye--they need water.<br>  <br>  I put the Coffee on the shelf and discover my reading glasses that I've been searching for all morning.<br>  <br>  I decide I better put them back on my desk, but first I'm going to water the flowers.<br>  <br>  I set the glasses back down on the shelf, Fill a container with water and suddenly spot the TV remote, someone left on the kitchen table.<br>  <br>  I realize that tonight when we go to watch TV, I'll be looking for the remote, But I won't remember that it's on the kitchen table, So I decide to put it back on the TV where it belongs, But first I'll water the flowers.<br>  <br>  I pour some water in the flowers, But quite a bit of it spills on the floor. <br>  <br>  So, I set the remote back on the table, Get some towels and wipe up the spill.<br>  <br>  Then, I head down the hall trying to Remember what I was planning to do.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day:<br>  <br>  The car isn't washed<br>  <br>  The bills aren't paid <br>  <br>  There is a cold cup of coffee sitting on the counter<br>  <br>  The flowers don't have enough water,<br>  <br>  There is still only 1 cheque in my cheque book,<br>  <br>  I can't find the remote,<br>  <br>  I can't find my glasses, <br>  <br>  And I don't remember what I did with the car keys.<br>  <br>  Then, when I try to figure out why nothing got done today, I'm really baffled because I know I was busy all damn day, And I'm really tired.<br>  <br>  I realize this is a serious problem, And I'll try to get some help for it, But first I'll check my e-mail....|`|pFs71HsHaa	Thanks, that was great.|`|zYQf6y0uaa	Sounds familiar.....oh no|`|jQeX98Xyaa	haha, funny!|`|sB1e8bIGaa	i'm no senior, but these jokes are pretty darn funny|`|Kx9QgyjSaa	I enjoyed 'em & I' not over 60 ... yet.

I believe they are showing new episodes or never seen episodes starting Friday as part of the "laser awesome" block on Nick Toons|`|RrQNJsVsaa	Sorry, sometimes guides and scheduals are wrong. They were cancelled for making kids go emo from Sam. So the parents made kids stop watching it. They didn't have much veiwers so they were cancelled. They did a re-show if they made it they are back on the show. But results say they failed.|`|8AfLWiYeaa	you probably were dreaming....|`|baED7E2daa	I did see a rather new episode of Danny Phantom last night.  At least it was new to me.  In the episode, Mayor Vlad captures a weather-controlling ghost and makes him do his bidding.  When Danny fights it, he gets zapped by lightning, and the end result is Danny's mood controls the weather.|`|CQX3TAIoaa	You saw a commercial? Hmm. Nick has been on for a couple of hours at my home and I haven't seen one. I might have just had really bad luck though. <br>  <br>  Try to find the clip on youtube. But, I'm pretty sure that if they were bringing DP back, they'd have advertised the heck out of it. Like they do everything nowadays. That's the only thing that's making me skeptical about it. Other than that, if you did see a commercial, I think it's safe to assume.

HXg8Vagpaa	The whole thing is driving me the Fudge crazy!! Nick needs a royal a$$ whooping. I can't wait for Adam and Phyllis to get it on then he will see what it feels like. I am not a huge Sharon fan but geez, she is humping every man in sight. Nick, Billy, and if Brad was alive he would be getting some of that cookie too!! But to answer the question I think Nick is going to be the father. For god's sake, it is Y&R and I am guessing they are going to be the new Nikki and Victor in the years to come. Look at their past relationship, Victor is cheater and so is Nikki, monkey see monkey do. They way you act is a learned behavior. Like father like son.<br>  <br>  LOL, okay Brandy G, just because you like Sharon doesn't  give you the right to pass on THUMBS DOWN because the rest of have a problem with whore of a charectar Sharon. Besides it is only our opinion. LOL, crazy lad.|`|eff556e68b639b40e89cc7516013482faa	I think that the baby daddy will be Billy. After all, Chloe just had his baby. And don't forget that he also slept with Lilly, and there's rumors about a possible pregnancy with her. Talk about drama!|`|LO3BMobRaa	I like Sharon, I understand her ballin' Nick, but Billy, un uhn.

He is unafraid of taking any approach necessary with songwriting form, vocal technique, instrumentation and effects to convey the emotions, symbolism, and meanings that are found throughout his works. His ability to capture the ethereal and profoundly move the listener is uncanny, and his lyrics are appropriately challenging, breathtaking and deep.<br>  <br>  John Lennon & Paul McCartney (The Beatles) - I defy you to find a greater songwriting team in modern popular music. In Paul and John's constant quest to write a better song than the last attempt of the other, they created unique, memorable, and incredible music that will last forever. With 21 singles to reach #1 on the charts, most of them ubiquitous in modern culture, and an unfathomable number of musicians influenced by them, it is unlikely that The Beatles' presence will ever stop being felt.

She got bored with much of it, which was good because than she went to refill the drinks and popcorn.<br>  <br>  In a personal sense, I would not recommend this for teens, but so many (not all) teens have received little moral teaching from their parents, so it may not matter.<br>  <br>  You see a lot of Dr. Manhattan's pecker, which did catch my daughter's attention, repeatedly.

1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	I hardly ever go out to the movies any more, let alone on opening night, but Y/A has changed my approach to some things.  For example, I felt I had to go out at midnight and buy the last Harry Potter book and stay off the net reading it because if I didn't, somebody on Y/A would post a spoiler.<br>  <br>  So, to summarize, I agree with your rant and point my finger at the net as a largely contributing factor.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	don't bash it. a lot of movie makers depends on that opening night to draw in a lot of people to see it to make their money because if the movie was bad then those people will go tell their friends so they won't go see it. so if they don't make a bang on opening night then they might lose money|`|x4g8Dw5Raa	I hate that crap as well thats why I never go to Opening nights for popular movies|`|aOFdtoR4aa	Cure For Tinnitus - Help People Stop The Ringing In Their Ears.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rubyurl.com/Dbvn" rel="nofollow">http://rubyurl.com/Dbvn</a>|`|2SIOE10Uaa	the ONLY reason I am ever compelled to go to opening night is to see the movie before any spoilers reach my ears.  I hate it when others ruin plots, & venturing out to opening night or completely secluding myself seem to be the only options for keeping the story intact. <br>  <br>  Also, try not to think in majorities.<br>  <br>  because adding a disclaimer is the equivalent of saying "no offense," which, in reality, means nothing.<br>  <br>  example: this was such a dumb question and probably a severe wast of life .... no offense.<br>  <br>  not that I'm dissing your question,  I actually found it quite interesting.<br>  <br>  best wishes|`|kDXMKfMDaa	people go to movies on opening night because:<br>  <br>  1. the trailers last like 6months and they cant wait any longerrrr<br>  <br>  2. of course you have to see it before everyone else so that they can feel completely jealous and you'll be like " OH ya, im THAT cool :)"<br>  <br>  3.

Y1aAGPURaa	LOL!!!!!    Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A middle aged woman went to her doctor to ask advice in reviving her husband's libido. <br>  <br>  'What about trying Viagra?' asked the doctor. <br>  <br>  'Not a chance', she said. 'He won't even take an aspirin.' <br>  <br>  'Not a problem,' replied the doctor. "Drop the Viagra tablet into his coffee. He won't even taste it... Give it a try and call me in a week to let me know how things went.' <br>  <br>  When she called the doctor he asked how it went and she exclaimed, T'was horrid! Just terrible, doctor!' <br>  <br>  'Really? What happened?' asked the doctor. <br>  <br>  'Well, I did as you said and slipped it in his coffee and after just a few sips he jumped straight up, with a twinkle in his eye and with his pants a-bulging fiercely! <br>  With one swoop of his arm, he sent the cups and tablecloth flying, ripped me clothes to tatters and took me then and there passionately on the tabletop! It was a nightmare, I tell you, an absolute nightmare!' <br>  <br>  'Do you mean the sex your husband provided wasn't good?' <br>  <br>  On the contrary, it was the best sex I've had in 25 years!............<br>  <br>  But sure as I'm sittin here, I'll never be able to show me face in Starbucks again!'|`|Da1bmBQnaa	that freakin sucks <br>  GET BETTER JOKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|MKJAQ2koaa	I thought is was good.

K2QwEM4raa	I think online game playing is fun and you don't have to spend any money and you can win money or points for gifts. There are many fun and easy and hard games you can play. Iwon.com,Aol games, and Pogo are the ones that are my favorites,you can even pick Card games,bingo,checker,s,poker puzzles,pool,bowling,chest,slots,etc almost any game you can think of. I won my favorite you can play games to win 3,000 dollars and use the coins you earn to enter sweepstakes every (big money) year, monthly,weekly or daily.I also like to research or look up every thing that I need to know or that interest me. You can even look up hobbies or go to youtube and learn how to do many things. Their are lots of blogs that you can voice your opinion about the things that bother or effect you.He Also can inter sweepstakes and read the news. And I really enjoy Yahoo answers because it gives me a chance to try and help someone and a lot of people need advice from people like your father who is honest and paid her due and probably has learned a lot about life. Hope this helps and best of luck to your dad, just tell him to just start on some of these things and then he will be to busy to watch much tv and anyway he can tape the shows he miss or go to the station because most of them will play it on the internet or do recaps. :)|`|Zx1LrNrCaa	Would he like to sell things on eBay?

fb45aa39fc9300c79143be72cfb997b0aa	I was giving an awards presentation  to a school.  Instead of saying "This year's Physical Fitness Award winners are..."  I flubbed it and said, "This year's Physical Fitness Award Wieners are..." it took a few minutes to get everyone back under control.|`|IqoRBVUTaa	Most embarrassing? Wow, that's hard......Ummm.....I'm gonna have to say when I almost drowned myself surfing. I caught a really sweet wave and my board came over top of me, I couldn't get my wrist band off and I was stuck under it for like, two minute before anyone got out there. So anyways, my rescuer just happened to be my worst enemy ever in the history of the world......Ever. And when he pulled me out of the water, I through my arms around him kissed him, and called him by my boyfriends name!! Lol! My boyfriend was running toward me through the water, he just, stopped when he saw all this, and he looked at me, he looked at him......I looked at me, and looked him......Than I realized what I'd just done........I was like, "Oh." It was hilarious! Pretty bad for my pride.....It hurt man.....It hurt bad......But at least I'm alive right? I'm pretty thankful for that. :)<br>  <br>  My boyfriend will not stop laughing when ever the word "Surfing" is ever manchoned.....Then he gets really, really quit.......|`|riZelipdaa	Fell in front of a huge amount of people.<br>  <br>  Broke my toe by tripping over it in front of a bunch of guys<br>  <br>  Said, "Hey, hottie" to this old man that I thought was one of my guy friends from the back.<br>  <br>  Smacked this random dude in the back of the head, again, for thinking it was one of my friends.<br>  <br>  Tried to say something about someone, when the person was two seats down from me.<br>  <br>  :)|`|uLelMuqZaa	Lots of things.

Me and my buddies Brooke and Austin were sitting on the ground, next to a bunch of jackets people had dropped there while they went to go play soccer. I said, "Hmm...I wonder what size Collin is!" and then checked the tag. I then said, "Haha! He's large!" And then I realized how sick that sounded.|`|ENA7czaaaa	Well, today, during lunch, I was drinking water. Then my friend said something that reminded me of something perverted.

Then I bumped into a girl by accident and my head went right into her chest.  That was awkward. <br>  2) I slipped on a wet floor and my hand picked up this girl's skirt.  I felt more embarrassed for her then for me.  <br>  3) fainted in front of the whole class, and I still haven't recovered from it fully.<br>  4) fell down stairs more than anyone, and hit my head more than anyone.  <br>  5) many more, but not so bad that I remember them.|`|6tGYe5roaa	Well this boy that I liked was driving me home from class.

svYiQZUHaa	Because people who like them and admire them aren't people!! They are Sheeple. They are bored with their own live and have to get pleasure from the fake lives they wish they had.|`|dPHN6jmuaa	Because we are living n a society that was taught to escape from reality. Through movies, television shows, the internet, music, etc. For the majority of us, we don't live the lives of celebrities (yeah the money is great, but most of they are NOT happy. Look at the addictions, rumors, divorces and so on. It is really sad.) so we escape through them. No debt or financial worries. Beautiful people around you. Big events and the world watching. The fact is, they are not normal. Yes, they are human, but not normal. But its great to see that you are not escaping, but living your life as you want. So congrats to you!|`|AA11522290	They idolize, admire, emulate them!!!
2LpWgU20aa	the music video is about him being posessed by a girl's love and his bandmates are doing rituals (such as eating chicken bones and all those other random things you see) to get him exorcized. that is why he is on that bench spazzing out and his eyes are rolling back. towards the end of the music video as caleb (the lead singer) is singing the chorus you can see green is coming out of his mouth (which is kind of supposed to be a spoof on the excorcist.) Its kind of confusing, but i looked it up and thats how i found out what it was about. and yes i do like the kings of leon.|`|y0hpaZi2aa	Um dude, theres plenty of videos to be stumped with dont waste<br>  your time with this one. The kings aren't big fans of videos(the video shoots in specific), I guess all the wierd **** like Matthew eating chicken was just to keep it fun. King Of The Rodeo has a much better<br>  video, but there videos dont define the music. Listen to Aha Shake<br>  Heartbreak if you haven't already.|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	First of all love Kings of Leon; I think they are fantastic; love all indie music.<br>  <br>  Okay the music video; just watched it on YouTube a second ago. My impression of it is; that it is very arty a little random. Most of the occurrences of the video (with the exception of the band scenes) is a way for the viewer to get an idea of the emotions of the singer; in a sort of metaphorical sense. <br>  <br>  I like the video its very creative; it really shows that they were certainly thinking outside the box with this one.|`|2pUU9RuYaa	I'm not sure what the video is about..but I do know that the song is about a bl0w j0b..haha.. :)<br>  <br>  edit: The video was directed by Sophie Muller, whose credits include "Smile" by Lily Allen and "Grace Kelly" by Mika. Caleb told MTV News: "I'm seeing things that are not really going on, and I'm seeing them do wacky things. And the things that I'm seeing make it look like I'm a pervert and I'm attracted to my family." His bassist brother Jared added: "If we didn't have so much trust in Sophie's previous work, we never would have picked up a treatment that has Caleb getting crazy on a bed and me chasing a chicken."|`|AA10795350	"Sex on Fire" is overrated and shouldn't define Kings of Leon.

If he hasn't contacted you...and he isn't being what he needs to be as a dad...it is better you find out now than later.  You have to raise that baby and look out for him or her.

You might want to look into jazz, because they were heavily influenced by the genre, particularly improvisational, but just as it is with all great bands, it's going to be hard to find someone who meets the standards they've set.|`|Sih0xHJgaa	I think I suggested them in another one of your questions before but "Camel" are somewhat similar to Pink Floyd (but they sound like a mix of other bands as well). They do have their own sound though. Check them out. They are really really great!

Because no band (that I know of) is able to remake that sound.<br>  <br>                                     PINK FLOYD FOREVER!!!|`|2KI7LxUXaa	dood who said vinigar--- that is friggin amazing to see that some one else besides me and my mom love them now adays|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	I would say that Porcupine Tree is somewhat a modern Floyd with heavier rock and of course Neo Prog elements|`|wOc4Dqllaa	Porcupine Tree and the Smashing Pumpkins both have similar qualities, but more metal-y and grunge-y, respectively.|`|3g3SCnDDaa	There's a few that established a similar sound as Pink Floyd, though they are very obscure and not well known. Hold on, I'm off to get you some links. <br>  <br>  Okay, give some of these a try:<br>  <br>  1) This band is called Vinegar. They developed around the late 1960's, and their sound is mostly a combination of early Floyd psychedelia and late Floyd "space music".

rHCVpXw9aa	it depends how long its been i think. my friend used 2 play, and then she didnt even touch it for a while, and then we started taking lessons 2gether again (a group class) and she remembers stuff (not all of it tho. ) also, im not sure how good she was before. i think since uve alredy learned this, you willl start remembering once u take lessons again. uve prob forgot stuf, but it will come back. or if u id 4get it all, it would still b easier rather than if u started without ever seeing a guitar in your life. it might take a little bit.

cLW7vFUGaa	The character Rini never sang the song - it's by Stephanie Beard, who just happens to be Rini's English voice actress. The song isn't meant to be associated with Rini; it was performed as Stephanie Beard's radio personality "Suga BayBee" on the station Kiss 92 FM. It's a parody of Eminem's "The Real Slim Shady."

kYMD4tSmaa	okay i've seen them all ! this isn't a movie well kida but its the realist scariest thing i ever saw,i would'nt even watch it on my own computer in my house it literally freaked me out! go to u-tube: real exorcism of ANNELIESE MICHEL  so sad she was so pretty "was"|`|pNrDyNKAaa	Movies are rarely actually scary, but a nice intense one is the original Saw.

There have been a couple where I'm a little bit uneasy, mostly because I was watching them alone in the dark. I think I'm very difficult to scare when it comes to things in movies. I guess I have my parents to blame for that - see, they taught me the difference between fiction and fact at a young age and I guess I grew up without all the witches and goblins Halloween illusions like most children. I don't think that's a bad thing though, it just means I'm the only one who doesn't wet myself watching horror movies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, here is a list of my top 3 horror movies, rated purley on how much I enjoyed them:<br>  <br>  <br>  3. The Candyman -<br>  <br>  "Helen Lyle is a student who decides to write a thesis about local legends and myths. She visits a part of the town, where she learns about the legend of the Candyman, a one-armed man who appears when you say his name five times, in front of a mirror. Of course, Helen doesn't believe all this stuff, but the people of the area are really afraid. When she ignores their warnings and begins her investigation in the places that he is rumored to appear, a series of horrible murders begins. Could the legend be true?" <br>  <br>  A very clever film. I was probebly a bit more squeamish that others due to my phobia of wasps. One of the only horrors that made me cry.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Silence of the Lambs -<br>  <br>  "Young FBI agent Clarice Starling is assigned to help find a missing woman to save her from a psychopathic serial killer who skins his victims. Clarice attempts to gain a better insight into the twisted mind of the killer by talking to another psychopath Hannibal Lecter, who used to be a respected psychiatrist. FBI agent Jack Crawford believes that Lecter who is also a very powerful and clever mind manipulator have the answers to their questions to help locate the killer. Clarice must first try and gain Lecter's confidence before he is to give away any information."<br>  <br>  Again, a very clever film. I loved Hopkin's portrayal of Dr. Lecter, he was amazing! In fact, all of that cast was! One of my all-time favourite movies. Highly recommended.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Halloween -<br>  <br>  "The year is 1963, the night; Halloween. Police are called to 43 Lampkin Ln. only to discover that a 17 year Judith Myers had been stabbed to death, by her 6 year-old brother... After being institutionalized for 15 years, Myers breaks out just days before Halloween. No one knows nor would wish to find out what would happen on October 31st 1978, besides Myer's physciatrist Dr. Loomis. He knows Michael is coming back to Haddonfield, but by the time the town realizes it, it'll be to late for many people..."<br>  <br>  A classic, awesome movie with my favourite villain ever!<br>  <br>  <br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  Some notable metions are:<br>  <br>  Dawn of the Dead (remake), 30 Days of Night, The Shining, Shrooms, 28 Days Later, Psycho, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th ... and too much more!<br>  <br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  Have fun now .... ;)|`|aIjOfkM8aa	The Exorcist because of the scary girl that appears in the movie|`|9pLqulLwaa	Night Of The Living Dead (original)|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	JAWS- I think the movie Jaws was very scary

ISNT THAT AMAZING?|`|qLqYSeqRaa	No, it's just rumored that Billie is going to try and be more of a front man on the 21CB tour this year. So they got another dude to play guitar on a couple songs while on tour so Billie can sing.|`|Av4RauOyaa	well im not so siked about it because I love Billie playing guitar but the actual post says that Billie will still be playing but not in all songs maybe like in you know, Are We The Waiting/ St. Jimmy probably this guy is going to be the next Mike Pelino if you know what i mean and if you don't, Mike Pelino played the rhythm guitar when Jason played the lead guitar like in the songs i already motioned and i think in King For A Day and things like that but I don't think that Billie wont play anymore if so that would REALLY suck and i would be really sad but i doubt that, that will ever happen.|`|0PbYE3M7aa	That isn't true many Bands have two guitarists BIllie would probably just play rhythem guitar. even though there has never really ever been anything else but rhythem guitar in green day songs.|`|xwD8PUFlaa	No, No. Their hiring a SECOND guitarist to tour with 4 certain songs, they've done it before in the past.<br>  <br>  by any chance is it Jason White?

Guys having a femenine side can be a good thing. your the one with problems and honestly if you dont like it, move on. dont be a baby just because everybody doesnt want what you want.<br>  I hope you've grown from reading this because you're a real idiot<br>  i feel better|`|UE9e10Avaa	must i have to explain my reasons for loving the jonas brothers again? ok here it goes...i like the jonas brothers because they're good-hearted,down-to-earth,gentlemen that care about their fans. and on the contrary, they are all very masculine (joseph inparticular.) they are not girly and i'm sick of people saying this! and hello! they're very much musically gifted. oh, and they aren't homosexual either if that was one of your beliefs about them. i admit they've had some great songs and some not-so-great ones but overall, they're a great band to admire and listen to. and all the logic has not gone away in the world. have you ever thought that maybe you and your anti-jonas buddies are the ones that are corrupting this generation???

hVqRcej7aa	I thought that it was great. It's pretty creepy and quite brutal too. Its definitely rated R. Its also all in spanish if you didn't know. don't let that stop you from checking it out.

It explores the imagination of a young child that is dealing with a harsh reality, very similar to what a teen might experience. The film never seems to slow down or have any dull moments it has very unique images and scenes that leave watcher perplexed and wanting them to know what will happen next. In some ways it's similar to Alice in wonderland, but the plot and places she's in are completely different along with the villain. <br>  The ending is also nice.|`|6zr8aRUdaa	Well, it's a little creepy and bloody, but it's very creative and good.

FKdvF0VCaa	Ignore the haters ... I happen to believe they're all mentally retarded. <br>  <br>  Lovebug would be a good name. It really all depends on what the story is going to be about, the types of characters involved, etc. I write Jonas fanfictions too, not on youtube but elsewhere, and I find that song names are definitely a good place to start. You might also consider taking a line, or part of a line, from one of their songs. <br>  <br>  Inseparable<br>  Hello Beautiful <br>  Got Me Goin' Crazy <br>  ^ those would all be cool titles. <br>  <br>  You might also like:<br>  Take My Hand<br>  Those Eyes<br>  So In Love With You<br>  ^those would also work and those are lines from the songs.<br>  <br>  Going with your original idea, I'd suggest:<br>  Lovebug <br>  The Missing Part of Me<br>  You Don't Even Try<br>  Breathless <br>  <br>  <br>  And those are only suggestions. You can go find lyrics to any Jonas song you want and find a good title in them somewhere. Have fun!|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Broke Back Mountain 2 ....How are you going to report for a opinion??

I do all the time. Am I a bad fan? No, I just see them as people.|`|uEsGB9zDaa	no ok that's like me. I live in Toronto and they like never come here and the only time they had a concert or came was basically their summer concert and when they came on MOD.

EHVTw8hEaa	okay all of these idiots are talking about inertia.. this has nothing to do with inertia....<br>  <br>  a question like this is assuming that these were the only factors... considering that its not possible.. you dont have to be technical and add in factors such as wind speed etc...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the bullet would not go the same speed.... it would go exactly the same speed as you are going... and it would stay in the barrel.. dont think of it as the bullet staying where it is.. think of it as the bullet shooting and then the gunn keeping up with it at the exact same speed.... its much easier to think of it from that perspective...|`|7Ip4SSZmaa	I think that it would stay in the barrel!!<br>  If you're already going the same speed as the bullet, then how could it just automatically start going faster than what's it suppose to...<br>  Or....maybe it would come out a little bit from the force of the trigger being pulled, then it might go back into the gun...idk.<br>  I think i'm close enough!! =]<br>  Good question.|`|Het9lG90aa	whats that big word called?<br>  <br>  its on the tip of my toungue<br>  i got it!<br>  inertia<br>  right?|`|HyDlROg0aa	ugh... my brain hurts =P|`|SMlNjLCZaa	the bullet would resist going out of the barrel so it would stay. therefore causing you to slow down and eventualy stopping. but that's if your going at a constant speed. <br>  if you were decreasing speed as you pulled the trigger, it would shoot no more than an inch. before inertia, and wind resistance would slow you down and you would fall. <br>  =]]]]|`|rcN76taEaa	why would it stay in the barrel?? the bullet has the same velocity as you since you have the gun in your hand. so wouldn't the bullet start with a nonzero speed? the bullet would always be ahead of you??/ haha i dont know|`|BUe6hAK8aa	huh?<br>  hm.<br>  ouch.<br>  i'm thinkinq tew hard.<br>  thanx a lot- a little light bulb jux burnt out over my head.<br>  I have no extras!<br>  c=|`|RNi6gytSaa	I think the bullet would come out and fly back in your face because of the force. but idk.. :S Maybe it would stay in the gun.|`|94999207fac55776c0f040db3e7d1a50aa	It wouldnt leave at twice the speed; the speed the gun is moving doesnt effect how fast the bullet comes out. I dont think it would stay in the barrel because the barrel would protect the bullet from outside forces. It might shoot out, and since youre moving as fast as it, the bullet would stay the barrels length ahead of you.
1263731b76a5881b98bbd0aacec9a2cdaa	I love Michael Buble's music and voice but I, personally, don't consider him to be in the same league as Sinatra. Frank Sinatra, and the other great vocalists of his time, are viewed as "untouchable" much like no other band could be as good as The Beatles. That doesn't mean Buble is a bad singer or terrible musician; but there was only one Sinatra and I feel he'll be the world's one and only! :)|`|d065dd48110ed50d780ec1de848b4c9aaa	He's better.<br>  We love the legends because they made way for the newbies, but he's even greater.<br>  I love him and I'm going to marry him. ^_^|`|TZz1uPY2aa	Ever heard Harry Connick Jr. It's been done before.

All they end up doing is coming off as arrogant; if this person reacted to you in such a way, just brush it off because they aren't worth it. It's also possible that they were not raised with proper social skills and that meeting new people can be stressful for them.|`|wbVd38d2aa	It might be unimportant to you, but you don't know what her background is. She might have had bad experiences in the past. Maybe she's just not a 'people person'. Maybe she thought that maybe you are interested in more than just her name and got freaked out.

Y1aAGPURaa	The Smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a <br>  surrogate father to start their family. <br>  <br>  On the day the proxy father <br>  was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, <br>  <br>  'Well, I'm off now. The man should be here soon.' <br>  <br>  Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby <br>  photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale. <br>  <br>  'Good morning, Ma'am', he said, 'I've come to...' <br>  <br>  'Oh, no need to explain,' Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, 'I've <br>  been expecting you.' <br>  <br>  'Have you really?' said the photographer. 'Well, that's good. <br>  <br>  Did you know babies are my specialty?' <br>  <br>  'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and <br>  have a seat'. <br>  <br>  After a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?' <br>  <br>  'Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on <br>  the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the <br>  living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.' <br>  <br>  'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry <br>  and me!' <br>  <br>  'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But <br>  if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven <br>  angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.' <br>  <br>  'My, that's a lot!', gasped Mrs. Smith <br>  <br>  'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to <br>  be In and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed <br>  with that.' <br>  <br>  'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Smith quietly <br>  <br>  The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of <br>  his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said . <br>  <br>  'Oh, my word!' Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat. <br>  'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider <br>  their mother was so difficult to work with.' <br>  <br>  'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Smith . <br>  <br>  'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get <br>  the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep<br>  to get a good look' <br>  <br>  'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Smith , her eyes wide with amazement. <br>  <br>  'Yes', the photographer replied. 'And for more than three hours, <br>  too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could <br>  hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my<br>  shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, <br>  I just had to pack it all in.' <br>  <br>  Mrs. Smith leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually chewed on <br>  your, uh...equipment?' <br>  <br>  'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my <br>  tripod and we can get to work right away.' <br>  <br>  'Tripod?' <br>  <br>  'Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's <br>  much too big to be held in the hand very long.' <br>  <br>  Mrs. Smith fainted.
AA12108244	The book was written during 1985 so the political aspect does apply to that time period, but not really to today. They've been trying to make the movie for 20 years and I can understand why keeping it in the same time period as the comic was key.<br>  <br>  I don't know about "cliche." The whole point is to break away from cliches: as a matter of fact, I know somebody who hated it because it was too "different." <br>  <br>  "Pretentious" is a word that's thrown around a lot, but I can see how it might apply. Ultimately, the movie does the comic justice visually, but thematically it doesn't tackle the bigger moral issues presented in Moore's seminal graphic novel. I thought it was a fair adaption and an okay movie, but it's not for everybody. <br>  <br>  I don't like the idea of Watchmen being a movie, but if it had to be, I'm glad it's this one. I enjoyed seeing the beloved characters come to life.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	You obviously never read the graphic novel (or any of Alan Moore's work) if you are applying labels like "cliche" and "pretentious" to it.<br>  <br>  Watchmen was the book that CREATED graphic novels, and it is one of the more famous literary works in modern times.<br>  <br>  And as for your read of the politics, you obviously weren't alive then because it was very true to form.<br>  <br>  You are criticizing a work you do not comprehend. Always a bad idea.

0unXsNi2aa	It is all about the teens and with all this let me get this strait inappropriate atitude and stuff that is on tv and internet. They like the stuff that they hear. Now I agree I liked it way better when it was all about the 80s/70s music. Sadly there is nothing we can do about it so we just have to deal with it and listen to what you like.|`|OGpB2dKHaa	The same way the repetitive beat of DISCO took over the late 70s.  Keep one thing in mind... Hip Hop "Musicians" take a lot of rock music to create those repetitive beats.|`|AgQForcYaa	Simple--- people are getting stupider, and much easier to manipulate their feeble minds to listen to crap they don't have to!<br>  <br>  Thankfully, a lot of people have seen the light, and stick to their rockin' ways!|`|qXQIHCqGaa	If your talking about the 2000 era of mainstream rap. Then I can say it sucks. Just like this pop rock sh*t today. Techno FTW!!|`|Ku3Tb24Laa	it about even,,jeez i HATE rap!|`|qiVE00ecaa	First of all, the rock days weren't 70's to 80's.  True rock was mostly late 60's.  Your thinking of that 80's Ratt ****.  Anyway, it has taken over just like any popular genre.  Look at the #1 billboard hits in the 80's.  It was all crap, full of one hit wonders just like today.   Same with the 60's (the Beegees, the monkeys, the beatles*).  Also, these rappers have catchy beats and songs that appeal to adolescents, who want to hear about sex and gangs.  Now a days, black people are worshipped in middle school because they are "ghetto" (very racist, because it's not like all blacks are poor).  Look closer, and see that all rap #1's are by black people, and that's the connection.  It's just the way of the times.  Who knows what will happen next decade jazz? electronica? classical?!!?|`|MZWdvdEwaa	Rap hasn't taken over in my book.|`|wXv50mNEaa	How has McCarthyist-esque idiocy taken over open-mindedness?<br>  <br>  Do me a favor and give these a listen.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aruMW9ewvzg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aruMW9ewv...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PaoLy7PHwk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PaoLy7PH...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8nd82s_Dh8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8nd82s_D...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S45cJwBkmA8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S45cJwBkm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9VYzNUXGDA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9VYzNUXG...</a><br>  <br>  Really listen to them all, and then tell me what you think.<br>  <br>  And don't come back playing the "there's some good rap, but it's basically all crap" card. If rap is not inherently bad, you can't criticize it as a genre.|`|AA10795350	It hasn't.|`|CeyuSMT9aa	Umm... that's what the kids like these days. I don't!|`|NQ3XZElFaa	1) Rock music is still extremely popular, there are still many rock radio stations and there are new rock bands every day. I don't see how rap has taken over.<br>  2) Rap is a valid genre. Listen to something produced by Dan the Automator or The Bomb Squad and call it a "repetitive beat." It takes just as much skill to create a great rap song as it does to create a great rock song.<br>  <br>  Rob Zeilesch: Why do rock fans act like rock music created rap? Rap samples a lot more from soul music and funk music than it does rock music. Rock fans are unwilling to just sit back and dislike rap, they have to depict it as the thief and destroyer of "real" music.  And what's wrong with sampling? Radiohead samples. John Cage samples. Led Zeppelin steals riffs from blues guitarists. Nirvana steals riffs from Boston. Music takes ideas from other music. Get over it.<br>  <br>  Edit: You're simply wrong. There are great electronic music producers who use the computer as an instrument. It might seem easy to create a rap instrumental, but it's very difficult to create a good one. And it isn't like rock music takes so much skill. There are plenty of rock bands that can barely play their insturments. How is music created on a computer any less real than music created by an electric guitar?<br>  <br>  Edit for Zielesch: So I'm not allowed to disagree with your "fact?" If you really listened to rap music, you would realize that it isn't just bastardized rock. I could say that rock musicians take a lot of their "music" from blues musicians. I don't think rock "music" is valid. You would probably disagree. So, you could either make an argument against me, "ripping on" my point, and prove me wrong, or do nothing. Your choice.<br>  I didn't mean to misspell your name, but I fail to see how it effects my point.<br>  <br>  Edit: Fine. I overreacted, and I shouldn't have put words in your mouth. I'm sorry. I don't exactly understand your point. Are you saying that it's a positive thing that rap is reintroducing rock music in a different context or that rock music wasn't all that great which is why the rock based beats are so repetitive in the first place or something else completely. And I do have a chip on my shoulder from a lot of closed-minded rock fans who are extremely quick to discredit rap. If you're not one of them, then I guess I misinterpreted your answer.

gNfq0t3Faa	Omg i hate miley shes a skank ..........The reason she famous is because  disney got her famous by Hannah Montana and she took advantage of the fame and started posing naked and dating 20-year old guys ! And alot of other bull****|`|2OIssqW1aa	It actually doesn't matter about age. She is a great role model and her hit show Hannah Montana got Miley Cyrus so famous. Her songs influence others and also are catchy. Unlike other disney stars she followed her dream to become more like her father in the music business. She worked hard and never gave up for this life. She loves who she is and she loves all her fans. She also has a book Miles to go that she wrote all by herself and not to mention the hannah montana movie on April 10th. For all miley lovers vote for her on KCA.|`|MvMR53CWaa	Well, she has famous sibs and a famous dad. So, that might contribute. She also makes kids/teens/tweens feel like they are not alone. She writes about real life situations to which people can relate... and sometimes the solution is hidden in the lyrics of songs... So, she really makes music that touches people and is inspirational... She also does things that any normal teen would do, showing that she is not too self-absorbed,|`|WR6jYq96aa	because of her father, and disney<br>  <br>  besides i don't see why kids think her "role model" material, i mean seriously!?!?! she's the biggest stereotypical person i know!,|`|utOVoGo3aa	Agreed, she is not a good role model. She is the next bald Brittany Spears, y'all watch and see!|`|PKVl1ZlWaa	her dad , disney channel & Entertainment Tonight|`|xgsmlISHaa	her dad...and because disney channel...|`|6SpkISEVaa	CuzZ she'Z bLonde AND bIlLy Ray CyruS's DaughTer..i Dont GeTT iT eIthEr yo she'Z so STUPID...!!!!|`|1Bg5E9GIaa	Because shes better than you and has more money...sorry.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	I don't know... she's a good actress... but I don't really know...|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Her daddy`s money helped her...|`|rl6MRtVWaa	She's "so famous" because she's "so talented."<br>  <br>  ...Nobody's perfect, of course she's gonna make mistakes. <br>  I think she has really good music (as Miley), and I really don't care about what she does on the weekends or whatever. Its her life.|`|XSa8fgNIaa	So what?<br>  Shes a famous singer/ actress!<br>  She doesnt have to be a perfect rolemodel<br>  at least shes real!|`|jsCjGUPuaa	HER DAD and that she is young and "talented" so people say so thats y|`|OLl5Zc6baa	because shes awesome unlike demi lovato this is a girl btw using my bros account
z3Ky0zNOaa	actually i think they just called it pre-hibernation.<br>  <br>  it wasnt really even much of a song, it was just some heavy guitar chunking they recorded for that episode. R.I.P. dime
hDqH0do7aa	yes it is true when clint kidnapes him gloria finds out vbecause detecive wallace comes to them at the hospital showing a pic of kevin holding the bomb and also tv repoters r there and Gloria says that she saved mrs c and also gives a plea to the kidnappes to let Kevin go and talks about how he had a very bad child hood with abuse and being locked in the closet and clint uses that to brainwash him and tourment him into robbing banks|`|ow1m3c8jaa	The rumors are saying that's what will happen, but I really hope not, Keven is such a totally different person now it would be really upsetting to watch if he goes back to his dark side again even if it is only temporary which I am hoping it will be if that is indeed what happens.<br>  <br>  I also hope this isn't just another way to drag on the story line with Clint, I want him gone for good pronto!!!!|`|YxynqOvtaa	if it does happen, i'm sure it won't be because he actually wants to. It'll be because Clint is either A. Forcing him, or B. Kevin finally blew a gasket after practically having a nervous breakdown in the trunk of the car. But like i said, i don't think he'd help Clint for fun.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I think Kevin has come too far in his life to turn bad for long.  Right now he is in such a stressful situation that he is just doing what he has to do and he is coping with the memories of his Father mistreating him (since he just had to relive all that with Clint).  I predict he will snap out of it or someone will find him and help him.  His acting is superb!  I read somewhere that this storyline could get him nominated for another Emmy.<br>  <br>  As far as Amber, I think they would be awesome together!!|`|ClRuPRs7aa	I hope not! I like this Kevin, and I would hate to see him as the bad guy. I hope he gets back home soon. And I also hope Mrs.C gets better and someone proves that it is really her.

cjknXzm9aa	perhaps its taboo to speak out against wrongs like that in hollywood for fear of backlash. this sort of thing might be commonplace. oprah can do what she wants. she has her money and no one can say anything to her. only rihanna can stop the abuse if it continues with one number 9-1-1.|`|f5705ff0a4dc130e92b935f3f3a73717aa	This is why I have always admired Oprah. Kudos to her for standing up for what's right and for a young woman who cannot and will not stand up for herself right now (Rihanna).|`|AA11880595	I agree but I don't in a way, we are all speculating really because of what the media say's but I also don't agree with Robin aka Rhianna's response which has been nothing!!! That in itself is sending a bad message, and Chris let's not start I have a 9 year old son that really looks up to him....|`|yZQG4Pnwaa	Because most black celebrity sisas are jacked up in the head like some of these idiotic answers! When somebody does something wrong, everybody is always yelling "Its none of my business!!" "Its none of our business!!" or "Only God can judge me!!".  I definitely give props to Oprah, because no one should put their hands on their wife, girlfriend, sister,mother, grandmother, aunt, niece, daughter (except spankings), or 1st female cousin! How in the hell is that being a man?? But that's what some black women love these days. They want a man to treat them right by beating on them, call them b*tches and hoes, sexual satisfaction instead of making love (there is a difference).|`|v3LRBTviaa	1ST OFF He Made a Mistake and none of these people should be judging him because its in the BIBLE not to judge anyone! And as long as i can remember nobody walking this earth is perfect except GOD! Everybody deserves a 2nd chance! Obviously rihanna must have taken him back for some reason! she might have played a big part in this whole thing! you never know but you should not be judgingg chris brown, you need to be judging yourself! because a sin is just as big as any other sin..So if you lie, cheat, steal whatever you made just as big of a sin as he has!!!!!!!!!|`|Mr93TLWraa	I think you need to be quiet because I'm on Chris Brown side and i really don't what he did to her because i think something to all they doing is saying what Chris Brown did|`|be7dfee477290ec33a396533f09acf22aa	Oprah is an attention grabbing opportunist.  She's inserting herself into a situation that has nothing to do with her and using it to make herself look good.  If she wants to help Rihanna, do it behind the scenes.  Don't sit on your show and make a big deal about sending a message to her.  You're F-ing Oprah, you can give her a call.  No one should be impressed by how she is handling herself.  All she's doing is making a bad situation worse for Rihanna by calling her out on it in public, all in the interest of proving how great she is.  That's really helpful.|`|TmzyWXqPaa	IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT ANY1 SAYS RIHANNA IS GONNA DO WHAT EVER SHE WANTS EVERY1 IS JUST WASTING THEIR BREATH SHES NOT GONNA LEAVE UNTIL SHE SEE'S THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING BUT HURT HER SHE IS TO NAIVE ONLY 21 EVERY1 SAY'S THEY WOULDN'T LET SUM1 DO THAT 2 THEM UNTIL YOU ARE IN THAT PLACE THEN ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ABUSIVE MEN ARE PURSUASIVE AND THEY WILL MAKE YOU THINK WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS NORMAL WITH ALL THE "SORRY'S" "I DIDNT MEAN IT" AND ETC...ALL YOU CAN DO IS PRAY FOR RIHANNA|`|HI9jZSObaa	because oprah is the queen! lol watch now that she said something rational about that whole situation other celebrities will start to speak out and go on oprahs side.|`|dAD7EGTxaa	I agree with what you say but i doesn't matter about being black or white it shouldnt happen in any cause

M0kVGA6Faa	Fences is divided into two acts. Act One is comprised of four scenes and Act Two has five. The play begins on a Friday, Troy and Bono's payday. Troy and Bono go to Troy's house for their weekly ritual of drinking and talking. Troy has asked Mr. Rand, their boss, why the black employees aren't allowed to drive the garbage trucks, only to lift the garbage. Bono thinks Troy is cheating on his wife, Rose. Troy and Rose's son, Cory, has been recruited by a college football team. Troy was in the Negro Leagues but never got a chance to play in the Major Leagues because he got too old to play just as the Major Leagues began accepting black players. Troy goes into a long epic story about his struggle in July of 1943 with death. Lyons shows up at the house because he knows it is Troy's payday. Rose reminds Troy about the fence she's asked him to finish building.<br>   <br>  Cory and Troy work on the fence. Cory breaks the news to Troy that he has given away his job at the local grocery store, the A&P, during the football season. Cory begs Troy to let him play because a coach from North Carolina is coming all the way to Pittsburgh to see Cory play. Troy refuses and demands Cory to get his job back.<br>   <br>  Act One, scene four takes place on Friday and mirrors scene one. Troy has won his case and has been assigned as the first colored garbage truck driver in the city. Bono and Troy remember their fathers and their childhood experiences of leaving home in the south and moving north. Cory comes home enraged after finding out that Troy told the football coach that Cory may not play on the team. Troy warns Cory that his insubordinance is "strike one," against him.<br>   <br>  Troy bails his brother Gabriel out of jail. Bono and Troy work on the fence. Bono explains to Troy and Cory that Rose wants the fence because she loves her family and wants to keep close to her love. Troy admits to Bono that he is having an affair with Alberta. Bono bets Troy that if he finishes building the fence for Rose, Bono will buy his wife, Lucille the refrigerator he has promised her for a long time. Troy tells Rose about a hearing in three weeks to determine whether or not Gabriel should be recommitted to an asylum. Troy tells Rose about his affair. Rose accuses Troy of taking and not giving. Troy grabs Rose's arm. Cory grabs Troy from behind. They fight and Troy wins. Troy calls "strike two" on Cory.<br>   <br>  Six months later, Troy says he is going over to the hospital to see Alberta who went into labor early. Rose tells Troy that Gabriel has been taken away to the asylum because Troy couldn't read the papers and signed him away. Alberta had a baby girl but died during childbirth. Troy challenges Death to come and get him after he builds a fence. Troy brings home his baby, Raynell. Rose takes in Raynell as her own child, but refuses to be dutiful as Troy's wife.<br>   <br>  On Troy's payday, Bono shows up unexpectedly. Troy and Bono acknowledge how each man made good on his bet about the fence and the refrigerator. Troy insists that Cory leave the house and provide for himself. Cory brings up Troy's recent failings with Rose. Cory points out that the house and property, from which Troy is throwing Cory out, should actually be owned by Gabriel whose government checks paid for most of the mortgage payments. Troy physically attacks Cory. Troy kicks Cory out of the house for good. Cory leaves. Troy swings the baseball bat in the air, taunting Death.<br>   <br>  Eight years later, Raynell plays in her newly planted garden. Troy has died from a heart attack. Cory returns home from the Marines to attend Troy's funeral. Lyons and Bono join Rose too. Cory refuses to attend. Rose teaches Cory that not attending Troy's funeral does not make Cory a man. Raynell and Cory sing one of Troy's father's blues songs. Gabriel turns up, released or escaped from the mental hospital. Gabe blows his trumpet but no sound comes out. He tries again but the trumpet will not play. Disappointed and hurt, Gabriel dances. He makes a cry and the Heavens open wide. He says, "That's the way that goes," and the play ends.

Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy)" or Kanye West "Graduation" might be what you want. They have loads of other songs but those are just my favorites. <br>  <br>  If you're going for intense basslines and plenty of swearing Lil Wayne is where it's at, especially "I'm Me" or his more pop style "Lollipop" (song of the year in 2008 not sure by what judge though).<br>  <br>  I'm listening to Gorilla Zoe's "What it is(feat.

It is a cool night, and the air is fresh and crisp. They keep walking, when all of a sudden two six year old girls pop up. "Oh my like god! You're the like Jonas Brothers!" they exclaim. The like Jonas Brothers stop and sign autographs for the girls. However, when the annoying middle brother bends down to sign one of the girls' illegally downloaded singles, both girls remove their skins and reveal themselves to be the ebola-infected aliens that they are. They rape the Jonas Brothers' face, then **** on them, and give them ebola, dengue fever, schizophrenia and herpes. They then return to their far off planet, having saved mankind.<br>  <br>  While the Jonas Brothers are lying on the ground, realising that having their faces raped by ebola-infected aliens dressed up as six year old girls is the closest they'll get to getting laid by anyone with an IQ above 1.3, a van full of gunmen appears. The gunmen load their machine guns with bullets made out of pure AIDS, and pump the Jonas Brothers full of, er, AIDS.<br>  <br>  The Jonas Brothers continue to lie there, as the potent mixture of AIDS, ebola, herpes and dengue fever combine to remove their vocal cords, and the schizophrenia encourages them to rape each others' faces despite these already having been raped by ebola-infected aliens. However, the syphilis which they already had from whichever Disney ***** they ****** last night combined with the dengue fever, AIDS, ebola and herpes to paralyse them.<br>  <br>  At that exact moment, a gang of suicide bombers, with bombs made out of pure atomic bombs appears and blows the little ***** sky high.<br>  <br>  Hooray!|`|DEHqdmVnaa	The Jonas brothers are a bunch of homeless morons who can't sing or dance, who have their music made up by other people for them.|`|zWfDudrqaa	try www.jonasbrothersfanfictionarchive.com theres tonza good stories, I would recomend maid 4 u...its a good story :P

The number starts from the elbow and moves towards the wrist on the inside of Magneto's left arm|`|WfLWLSXdaa	Magneto's Auschwitz tattoo was originally seen as # "214782" in Uncanny X-Men #161. However, the artist at the time did not realize how the numbering systems at Auschwitz worked and had given Magneto a number too high for him to have been among the first group of Jews to be tattooed there. The number was retconned in Excalibur (Vol. 3) #2 to # "24005".

M8qLP7MLaa	Good question.<br>  <br>  It could be something to do with storms (thunder clouds?) - but thats more of an ability than an element.<br>  <br>  According to the Naruto chakra elements, water is weak against earth but lightning is strong against earth. And as we know, water conducts electricity. Considering these facts I guess it could enhance the attack power of the other chakra element nature.|`|SLBb7uWgaa	In naruto they have, Earth Element is weaker than Lightning Element(Sasuke element)  which is weaker than Wind Element which( Naruto Element ). But the wind element is weaker than Fire Element(Sasuke Element) but weaker than Water Element.<br>  As of now Naruto only uses the wind, but maybe in the future he can use the water element.

And I think that If they had of just made four movies instead and had the Saw V as Saw IV and just left it at that it would have been just as good.<br>  <br>  But all of them are definitely worth a look at. I enjoyed them.|`|vijGOcPCaa	I enjoy the Saw films because while the gore can go a bit over the top for those that have a weak heart, the story lines tie into the previous movie so intricately that its very complex and the story is just great, the gore is great if you are into it, but if you have seen the first two saws, you will need to see the third to continue to follow the progression of the mysterious story line.|`|8XEIMuBqaa	Pretty homosexual...I won't lie friend.

6In638rbaa	I don't know what to think. I think Liz is right that Kimber never really loved Christian and that she used him. I missed a couple of episodes but I'm wondering why Liz is with Christian, she's a lesbian. Did she do it out of sympathy because he had cancer and could possibly die? <br>  Although, they seem happy at first I don't think it's going to last. I don't see Christian being that committed. I think it's going to take more than that for him to change. I'm not sure what's going to happen next season but I'm looking forward to it.

I love Lady Gaga. <br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|TTsVhHq4aa	i completely agree with you. best pop album years. completely awesome.|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	if u took away one A and one G from your question u get what I think of it. =)|`|v811KD7raa	pssst - this will get major thumb downs<br>  <br>  lady gaga is ace, just dance is ace, her look is ace, teaching yourself piano aged 4 is ace|`|zUFdTyqZaa	I love it. Especially Summer boy! Also love the songs that are not on the album, e.g fashion|`|MZWdvdEwaa	Honestly, I think the only song she even did decent was "Just Dance."<br>  The rest is ****.
qeJUGE1eaa	I love Sarah Dessen's books, Also Cruel Summer by Alyson Noel is a good book. And of course Star Girl!by Spinelli =] but if you want a book that is a bit long and very sad but wonderful you should read Jodi Picoult's My Sister's Keeper.<br>  You can always go onto like Barnes & Nobles online and check the highest rated romance books and purchase those.|`|Igyp0mB1aa	Kissing Snow Flakes sucked just thought I would tell you.<br>  <br>  Jessica's Guide To Dating On The Dark Side, Vampire Academy(the series), Blue Bloods(the series), Vampire Kisses(the series), The Morganville Vampires Series, The Sweep Series, The Silver Kiss, Blood & Chocolate, House Of Night, Anything Sarah Dessen.<br>  <br>  That's some of the books I've read.|`|V1Zje2KYaa	Trying to think of first-person books that are good... there's "The Thief" by Megan Whalen Turner (historical fiction/fantasy, sort of ancient Greek-ish), "The Homeward Bounders" by Diana Wynne Jones (fantasy full of awesome and win), or "The Great Brain" by John Fitzgerald (historical semi-fiction, a more realistic look at growing up in the Old West)  Or for something darker that totally messes around with the whole idea of first-person, there's "You Don't Know Me", by David Klass.<br>  <br>  But you sound like a very conventional person, so perhaps you should just stick to "The Baby-Sitters' Club" books or the "Confessions of Georgia Nicolson" series (that one's got romance) and not strain your mind.|`|H6QSuB72aa	Have you ever read any of the Sarah Dessen books? They are really good and romantic. I would suggest Just Listen. It is amazing. Also, The Middle Place by Kelly Corrigan is great book but not a romance. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is also a great book.|`|bStEdyqEaa	well do you like the eragon series?<br>  its a very good book with a smidge of romance lol|`|djBYzX4Qaa	try l8r g8r, tiff. real great stuff|`|6MDMt4Mtaa	Try going off subject, like switch to suspense/mystery, until good romance books come out.
AMvR4u2Taa	We did this once in high school too. I don't remember all the details but I know we just had it in their classroom and hid the stuff in another teachers room. We had someone from the office call our teacher to the office for a bogus reason and got all the stuff set up while she was gone. We did not do much just balloons, a cake, and presents. She will appreciate anything that you guys do for her weather it be big or small.|`|hOdd1Ti1aa	there was a baby shower held for one of our friends and we played a game we you cant say baby if someone hears you say baby they take a pin at the end the person with the most pins wins a prize or something <br>  a cool idea for this game is if you know the sex of the baby then take saftey pins and tie a pink or blue ribbon to it|`|bStEdyqEaa	first make sure that she will be there 6th period and that shes not teaching then|`|E7utZf5Aaa	you can play games like: <br>  who can put a diaper on the fastest<br>  guess that baby food<br>  you can put plastic babies in frozen cups of water and see which person's defrost first.<br>  baby bingo

mbhAPC2naa	You know his real name is Lucas right? And anyway ask him on youtube..|`|N6cuuDAmaa	Idk... his real name is Lucas... google him... maybe you can find him...

And I know it for a fact. He said so on CNN.<br>  And his real name is Lucas. I don't know his last name...but I've heard it before.<br>  He's awesomely cute though. His videos are hilarious. My favorite is "Fred Goes To The Park."<br>  He was really good on iCarly too. It's weird to hear his real voice. Without his voice from Fred he's just a normal guy.|`|taMKteLVaa	idk but i love hiim :D<br>  <br>  google his name; and his real name is lucas; btw.

f77638df19b856e06b377813782f45faaa	I would make a television series about peoples dreams . So then the show would be really crazy in a way since dreams are that way , and maybe one of the main characters keeps on dreaming about a certain person and maybe it turns out that certain person actually exists . Those two people never met and they keep on having dreams where both of them are in it and they somehow find out that they both actually exist . Then in like the second season they find out that they have special abilities with dreaming and that they aren't the only ones , like what they dream can actually happen .|`|FeUmyxqqaa	a show with a stud and a talking car or a show with a stud and beach bunnies. if such shows existed i would never go out.<br>  <br>  my fav is the simpsons, jerry seinfeld is ok, anything comedy would be good, maybe a show about rednecks,<br>  <br>   i like the furs answer

This is probably one of the main reasons I HATE THAT BASTARD, he's not even funny and his comedies suck.  people like that dont deserve to live,|`|4vka4Yb5aa	my nieces name is Ciara!!|`|Igyp0mB1aa	There is this kid at my school named Billy Martin.<br>  If you don't know who that is he's in Good Charlotte.|`|AA10261517	How funny!!

A professor and a genius, Professor Genius, is something of a right-hand man to the King.

1263731b76a5881b98bbd0aacec9a2cdaa	"Prospekt's March" contains some wonderful, previously unreleased songs, such as "Life in Technicolor II" and "Glass of Water" (two of my favorites). The "Lost" remix with rapper Jay-Z is okay but it seems strange to mash Coldplay's style with hip-hop (but that's just my opinion). Buy the whole EP - you won't be disappointed! :)<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you don't have this track already, buy the live version of "Lost/Viva La Vida" that was performed at the Grammys. It made me wish I was there!|`|v811KD7raa	wow you sound like a major coldplay fan you have all the studio albums<br>  <br>  im not sure which album to recommend but heres one of my favourite coldplay songs that you might not have heard - "bigger stronger"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEN4__UhghU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEN4__Uhg...</a><br>  <br>  its from the blue room EP<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Room_(EP)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Ro...</a><br>  <br>  =)|`|97izv0Dbaa	NONE NONE!

Only homos listen to them.|`|ENkFZhlraa	Buy Prospekt's March - it's a great ep - there's no point in buying the Prospekt's March version of Viva la Vida if you already own the album though so just get the ep ;)<br>  <br>  I really see no point in buying the Live 2003 album when you already own all four Coldplay albums, but if live albums are your thing hey go for it.

He said, 'I am not talking to a 32 year old sponge that wants a raise.' I don't watch it no more. But I know he said that. So he is 32 years old. Nobody could barely hear it.

o2FJIXS9aa	I can't remember all their names, but I know that I dislike Sandra because of her attitude - like she's not going to be nice and try to be friendly and thinks she's all that. I like the one with the freaky eyes, Allison. This sounds weird, but she has the same look in her eyes as my tiniest and strangest cat. I think the best looking is the girl of Puerto Rican descent, but things are not looking good for her with comments by the judges saying, "She relies on pretty." I think a top contender is the black girl that Tyra says will look good till she's 80, the one with "the wind in her face."|`|epAtqgvhaa	they have a poll on writingdivas.com, im not sure if i have a fav yet

AA12381582	If your wanting 3d like they have in the theaters then field sequencial is pretty close.  Now for that it is recomended that you use the older tube televisions.  I have read that sometimes it will work with plasma and lcd but not always.  For field sequencial you need the convertor and glasses and dvds in field sequencial.  Here is a system at amazon.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Collection-Adventure-Encounter-Dimension/dp/B00005QW5S/ref=cm_lmf_tit_2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Collectio...</a><br>  <br>  The only other option you have is to use the red and blue 3d dvds which is not quite as good but does work.|`|5VQrGtIIaa	Several hundred thousand dollars.

O6WXAaN2aa	12/8 means that there are 12 beats in each measure, and that the 8th note gets the beat.<br>  Dotted quarter note gets three beats, and an eighth note gets one. So your rhythm will be 123, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.<br>  It is tricky to learn. If you can just remember than an eight note gets one beat, it becomes easier.<br>  Hope I helped. I know it is frustrating!

You dont think a 13 year old doesnt know what sex is. No matter how mature they are. Kids need to know there bodies and know that sex is a part of human interaction from a young age.

The lineup doesn't cater to those bands or those fans, really. Coachella is all about emerging indie artists.

The rest of the bands are there to showcase their talents, for the audience to discover them.<br>  <br>  I saw the Killers at Coachella in 2004 before 'Hot Fuss' came out.

Because of the superlative cost of the school uniform, Haruhi resorts to wearing long slacks, polo shirts and a vest. Combined with her large glasses and tousled short hair, Haruhi's look causes her to be confused for a boy.<br>  <br>  Looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi stumbles upon the Third Music Room, the working place of the Ouran Host Club, a group of six attractive male students who spend their time charming and entertaining the school's girls for profit. During their first meeting, Haruhi accidentally knocks over a vase valued at ￥8,000,000.<br>  <br>  In order to pay off the large sum, Haruhi is employed as the club's "dog" and constantly ordered to do menial tasks like serving food or cleaning up. The Club president, without knowing she is really a girl, promotes Haruhi to "host" as soon as he discovers her potential.

I first heard this song on The Hills. It’s bubble gummy, but that doesn’t mean that it’s bad. Cheese flavoured (spelled that way since Lights is canadian) gum to be exact.<br>  <br>  Last Day Of Our Love, by The Bird And The Bee<br>  With its retro-ish sound and wispy vocals, listening to this song is like eating cotton candy in the park on a brisk fall day in the 1960s.<br>  <br>  I Adore You, by Melpo Mene<br>  Like I’ve said before, this song is so frikkin cute. So, if you’ve had enough of shiba-inu puppycam, listen to this.<br>  <br>  Only A Song, by Ben Sollee<br>  This dude is like the coolest cello player I know. Well, besides that dude Yo Yo Ma, that dude is bad ***.<br>  <br>  Momma’s Boy, by Chromeo<br>  Chromeo rocks. This song, while honestly, not as good as “Needy Girl,” is still a really solid, solid track from the Montreal duo. (Hmm.. why are there so many Canadians on my list?)<br>  <br>  A Lovely Beginning, by Vic Ruggiero featuring Lisa<br>  So, Masnick and I went to see Vic play at Amante this year. He has been doing solo projects, sans the Slackers, for awhile now, and yah, it’s good.. This track is from his latest solo cd, and features some woman named “Lisa,” who Masnick tells me is German or something. It’s not very ska, it’s got a nice Calypso thing going on..<br>  <br>  I’m Yours, by Jason Mraz<br>  This is the second song that I’ve been introduced to by Jocelyn Yvette, a girl who covers songs and posts the videos on YouTube. I found her cover of Regina Spektor’s “Samson” last year, which is still one of my favorite versions of that song.. Anyway, here’s her version of I’m Yours if you’re interested.. Anyway, she’s good, and I wonder if she’ll make it big one of these days.. Oh yah, and Jason Mraz does a pretty good job on his song too. Thing is, after hearing this song, I bought the whole album, and I must say it sucks pretty bad. Aside from this song and “Lucky” with Colbie Cailait, the entire album is pretty much teh suck.<br>  <br>  To Be Loved, by Joan As Policewoman<br>  Yet another sophomore album release on this list (along with Chromeo), this track is really, really good.. but.. “I Defy” from her first album is absolutely amazing, which is the same problem I had with this year’s Chromeo track… Oh, the bitchy shadows of success.<br>  <br>  Coney Island, by Good Old War<br>  Weeee! I fun little country-ish, bluegrass ditty. It’s got it all knee slappin’, vocal harmonies, pickin’ guitar, and a tambourine.<br>  <br>  Falcon Jab, by Ratatat<br>  Ratatat’s album LP3 is probably my vote for best album of the year. It’s insane. It’s hard for me to even pick a best song off that entire album, so just go buy it and listen to it in its whole-y glory please.<br>  <br>  Undertow, by Stars<br>  Sheeza, yet another Canadian on this list. I guess they make good music up there. I first heard this song when Stars played the Fillmore, and immediately I was in love with it. A simple soothing melody followed by a nicely jamming bridge.. good stuff.<br>  <br>  Anyway… that’s it.. if you’ve made it this far, then you deserve to actually LISTEN to this mixtape hahha<br>  <br>  <br>  Don’t Watch Me Dancing by Little Joy.<br>  Can’t Help Falling in Love by Ingrid Michaelson.|`|lOR7CH0waa	Well I can't name 15 that are completely clean, but I like<br>  1.Extreme Days-Toby Mac<br>  2.Say the Words-DC Talk<br>  3.When He Returns-Kevin Max<br>  4.Confessional Booth-Kevin Max<br>  5.Cut and Move-Day of Fire<br>  6.Boomin'-Toby Mac<br>  7.The Hardway-DC Talk<br>  8.What if I Stumble?-DC Talk<br>  9.Wish We'd All Been Ready-DC Talk<br>  10.Chance-DC Talk<br>  11.My Friend So Long-DC Talk<br>  12.SugarCoatIt-DC Talk<br>  13.Between You and Me-DC Talk<br>  14.Sanctuary-Kevin Max<br>  15.Beautiful Mind-Kevin Max<br>  <br>  Oh, I guess I did manage to come up with 15 clean ones.

I would just start daydreaming and nod my head at the teacher at the right times.|`|ws0nvFi5aa	I learned a term for this from my child development class, (i forgot the name) and it's just what happens to you, there's a breathing abnormality.

I think some of my classmates said that it'd happen to them sometimes. <br>   <br>   Yours seems to sound like it's hurting you.

0uDcjtuLaa	I agree, if anything she was probably beating on him, especially after reading that she used to physically fight her brothers and smash glasses in their faces.<br>  <a href="http://www.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/rihanna/rihannas-brother-war.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.askmen.com/celebs/entertainme...</a><br>  <br>  They're doing this because it's public, if this weren't public he wouldn't be getting charged with felonies, people are looking out for themselves.<br>  <br>  BTW, I'm a woman and I don't condone beating on women,but I don't condone it the other way either.|`|AA11627844	yeah but you dont hit people that you love..its wrong...domestic violence is a serious matter and no one shuld get away with it. ever. he shuld of thought of that before he hit her if he hit her ...if he didnt then shes a liar and celebrties r stupid|`|oAOUAVVAaa	Its today's society.  A lot of people think that once you've committed a crime that you should be locked up and throw away the key.  The problem is that people who have committed crimes in their youth, are still paying that debt 10-15 years later.  Hurts them when they try to find a job, get a bank loan, etc.  But the reality of it all is this, if he wasn't a celebrity, he'd probably be in jail right now.|`|D9k5Fou5aa	Well, it's them that are hurting their career. Young ppl look up to them, and parents are pissed that they're setting such a bad example. I don't think what he did was a mistake. You just don't beat a girl becuz it's a mistake. IT's very likely that he'll continue to live in such a way for the rest of his life, and at 19, he's just getting started.<br>  <br>  I don't care. I don't like their music. I just think it's funny.|`|d065dd48110ed50d780ec1de848b4c9aaa	I'm with you. He made a huge mistake and the rumor of him getting herpes if true does not excuse him. But its not like he is a bad person.<br>  Lets assume he got herpes...if it were any other man he might've killed the girl.
sBh8U18yaa	BECAUSE HES A NEW YOUNG AND UP COMING PLAYER AND PEOPLE LIKE TOO SHORT DONT WANT THAT BROTHA TO SHINE!!!!!!!!!|`|sfqbNzRZaa	The world is tough. If you **** up, that's not our problem, and we don't have to help you. Only some do, but no one at all has to. There is 6.5billion people on earth, we can't be sympathetic every time each one fucks up.|`|0O3JvmE7aa	Any man,regardless of race,who beats on a woman is garbage,and,being garbage,needs to be tossed out.<br>  <br>  And yet another black shows his racism by accusing whites of being racist.<br>  <br>  And before you start accusing me of being some racist white guy,I'm not.I'm Native American who has observed over the years that blacks are more blatantly racist than almost all the whites I have ever known.|`|WyxxDgSeaa	Race has nothing to do with this particular issue...fame does. Publicity's the price celebrities pay. But if Chris Brown's life and/or career is destroyed, there is only one person to blame and that is Chris himself. You refer to him both as a "19 yr old kid" and a "young man." He'd better decide which he is and get his act together for his own sake.|`|LMgUpEgjaa	Real men do not hit a smaller, defenseless female. No excuses- Love doesn't hurt- hate does. Real men are protectors of those they love, they don't abuse them.<br>   Brown doesn't respect or love her. Brown isn't a real man but an angry immature man. Sure he can get counseling and change- if he wants to.<br>  I honestly don't think race has anything to do with the publicity. They are both extremely popular and good looking, therefore, the tabloids will go where the money is. Bad news, death and violence sells.|`|VUKDrd2taa	Everybody gets angry, NOT everybody beats their girlfriend bloody and leaves her practically unconsious and tries to push her out of a car.<br>  Dont even bring race into it, he deserves what ever charges and jail time he gets.If she goes back to him which it looks like she is, i have no sympathy for her either, it will happen again.|`|AA11727779	Many abused women go back to the abuser. I should know. My sister was one of them .The first time he did it he kept saying sorry and it would never happen again. guess what..it did and the second time he just about killed her. beating someone is NOT a mistake. Its a form of rage that needs to be dealt with. How rich or the color of his skin means nothing to me. He needs to be punished for what he did. Most abusers do not stop after the First time. Black..white..purple or green..does not matter. it was her choice to take him back andi am not going to judge for her for it, but if it was me..i would made sure his a*( was put in jail|`|Ehox3Io2aa	Toni: It doesn't matter the facts of the case, he hit rihanna and that is one TRUE fact. He does not deserve anything he's gotten. I'd be the first person to say that the boy has talent but that does not justify hitting a women let along America's princess Rihanna and jackass, this isn't a race issue, this is a fame issue. If this was some random guy, you wouldn't jump to defend him, would? It just sucks that Chris can get a free pass just because he's famous. And Jackasses like you think that he shouldn't pay for what he did just because he got "talent" I think someone should beat you for being the ***** that you are.<br>  <br>  Angela: Ok, I can honestly care less about Chris Brown and Rihanna or their personal lives. I just think its wrong that people are just so infatuated with the media that they keep on assuming what really went down that night between Chris and Rihanna. Noone knows what went down. In fact, Chris and Rihanna are the only ones that know. I'm not condoning what Chris did was right but I'm also not judging him in a way that makes me look ridiculous because I don't actually know Chris and you can't really know a person unless you know them. Of course, the picture of Rihanna battered and stuff did say a thousand words, but  its their personal lives and everyone who's judging Chris or Rihanna should just mind their own buisness. Its not you, so why should you care? You're right, Chris did made a mistake...a HUGE one at that! But, maybe he's learned his lesson and won't do it again. Hell, maybe he's really getting anger management classes to prove that he can be a better man next time. I don't know nor do I care. I have my own life and so does everyone else and I suggest people start living it now and stop worrying about other peoples lives. Now, I'm not defending Chris but I'm not the one ridiculousy bringing down a person I don't know. I'm not a judgemental type of person, I don't care about other peoples lives but mine. Chris Brown was wrong to hit Rihanna, yes but does that mean people should be quick to judge and not give the boy a second chance? and if he messes up again, and didn't learn his lesson the first time, then his *** really deserves to be put in jail but as of a right now, noone knows about the future(: <br>  <br>  Toni: Wow. I think they got the point, Angela.<br>  <br>  Angela: *Pity nod at Toni*<br>  <br>  Toni: Alright, here's my view, the RIGHT view. I don't care what the media says, I don't care how many lies the media has told, there's one TRUE fact. Chris Brown beat Rihanna. <br>  <br>  Angela: Thank you captain..DUH!<br>  <br>  Toni: I don't care what the media says, that's what I know. That wasn't just one mistake. You don't make mistakes like that because if he did, then I think he would have stopped at like the first punch! And "maybe" he's sorry and "maybe" he wants to take angermanagement classes but here's another thing "maybe" he just wants his career back, which I think he shouldn't because he should not be a role model  for kids and he should not be a celebrity but fans like this idiot who wrote the question don't think he should pay for what he's done. And you know everybody's quick to say "He made a mistake and it shouldn't harm his career" But lets stop thinking about chris Brown for a minute. What would happen if he would have hit you? Lets think about Rihanna here. After the first punch, the second punch and God knows what else he did to her. Her crying, screams wishing he would just stop already. Her going to the hospital, her getting up in the morning, her face is sore, bruised and beat up. She looks in the mirror and she remembers every single thing that happened. Put yourself in her shoes, how would you feel? Would you say "Oh he's talented, this is all ok"? Well guess what? its not ok for anybody to beat up a women and get away with it regardless if it was a "mistake" because every action has a reaction. <br>  <br>  Angela: That's true but then again Toni you don't actually know a person unless you know them.<br>  <br>  Toni: You don't need to know a person to know they beat up a women. <br>  <br>  Angela: Ok. Giselle, what do you think? <br>  <br>  Giselle: Well, this is a very touching issue for both Angela and Toni. Angela loved Chris Brown, she thought he was very hot, talented, everything! But then out of nowhere this happens! Angela still cannot accept what happened, so she tries to burry it as if it didn't happen. So she doesn't wanna hear anything about it and she doesn't wanna care 'cause it'll make her hate Chris Brown and she doesn't want to. <br>  <br>  Angela: Thank you, Giselle(:<br>  <br>  Giselle: And then there's Toni. This is a very touching issue for Toni because she loved both Chris and Rihanna seperatly. She thought they were one of the greatest singers out there. When they joined together to create "Umbrella - Cinderella" She burned that song out because she loved them so much. When they started dating, she supported the relationship so much. That was like one of her favorite Hollywood couples. And then, this happens! T

ClRuPRs7aa	no, he's not gonna die. I read some spoilers that said someone will be arrested for the ATTEMPTED murder of Rick Forrester.<br>  And I think Pam did it. She had his car keys when he gave them to her to get something from the car...|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	Oh... I wish Rick would DIE, but that's just wishful thinking, I'm sure somehow he'll manage to survive the explosion. It may look like Ridge did it, but the way he was treating Pam, it is most likely her that had something to do with it. Maybe she went off her meds, like when she tried to kill Donna that way she will have an excuse... I really HATE Rick though, he is disgusting & deserves to die!|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	I don't think Rick will die, since they have just had Phoebe die.  And I think is it evil Pam, did you see the look on her face when they were talking about the whole rick thing?  yeah,  she is capable of ANYTHING  lol|`|LO3BMobRaa	No I don't believe Ridge would do this to him, so my guess would most likely be Pam.|`|5JgchYUEaa	i can't stand rick! that is so gross how he has slept with taylor and steffy and kissed and groped all on phoebe. you can definitely tell that brooke is his mother. pam is unstable, so i think that she did it. she probably forgot a couple of doses of her pills.|`|SkY4Vgpsaa	It would make sense for it to be Ridge, since Rick has been with Taylor & both their daughters & is responsible for Phoebe's death!<br>  <br>  RICK MUST DIE!!!|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Ridge talked to someone on his cell and told them that Rick's still in the building and his car is still parked out back, so yes l agree that Ridge had something to do with it. There was a rumor that Rick's supposed to head to GC to help Amber with her designs, so maybe these two attempts on his life is what may bring that about.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I don't know - everyone looks guilty in a way.  I don't think he will die - I haven't heard anything about the actor leaving the show.<br>  <br>  I do know that on March 12th someone is coming back on the show that was on in 1989.  He will be a suspect in the who-tried-to-kill-Rick plot.  I read that in the TV Guide.

If they got of that freakin' DC they'd have some freakin' respect.|`|RyRLahS7aa	Welcome to reality.|`|kivwSfpgaa	good lord, love you haha. couldnt have said it better myself|`|0sZQ8xxIaa	how old are you ?|`|b3ID1NbUaa	well hannah montana is aimed at 14 and under year girls, so of course you arent going to like it, and being male, i wouldnt expect you to agree with the Jonas craze.<br>  <br>  i dont know what the jonas brothers are trying to prove staying with disney, it obviously isnt all about the music as they so claim, otherwise theyd get out of disney, so theyre music would be taken seriosly, they are just trying to get the money out of the tv shows, movie etc....<br>  <br>  but get off fans backs, they can be a weird as they want.|`|SrxGF07Eaa	I totally agree. But I think their fans are worse than the stars themselves. I mean Come On. What's so great about them? They're just people like everyone else, they put their pants on one leg at a time.|`|WoQe1alFaa	miley is <br>  not the jonas brothers:)|`|M9EcpbmDaa	okay, im a big bigg majorly big fan of the jonas brothers..i hope thats okay with you guys! haha and y'know, mileys okay.<br>  but yeah, they are hyped more than any other singers in the world?<br>  but that is because of people like you..not to be rude. but the amount of haters going round is making them more known, now its got huge. <br>  part of the reason the jonas brothers are popular is due to ther looks, i admit. but also due to the fact they are really great boys, no matter how much someone could try to hate on them, ther is nothing to badly critisise about them..<br>  miley is popular because..um..well shes not exactly anything special, neither of them are more special than any other bands but it is linked to disney and the age of the fans, adults dont go crazy over what bands they like but kids do, so your gunna know about it more.<br>  <br>  i personally would LOVE to work for disney (im 15 now) but its got some awesome people working for it and it'd be cool to star on the shows cos i like them aswell :]<br>  <br>  hope i somewhat helped? haha<br>  <br>  edit: and yeah i agree with the lady a couple above me, us fans may be as weird as we want, weird is better than normal, its less boring and more ...fun..yeah.. :D

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	1.) You have to draw your own conclusion as to whether or not Dotty dropped the ball on purpose. <br>  <br>  The point of earlier scenes  was to show that dottie had a fantastic grip and would never drop a ball unless it was on purpose. the conclusion is already drawn for you.<br>  <br>  2.) Okay, so if Dotty did drop the ball on purpose, she did it to help her sister, right? The problem I have with that is that Kit was not a likeable character at all in the movie. She was whiny, and had this distorted image that she was a great baseball player. So why would the producer have her come out on top and have Dotty, the likeable character come out on bottom? <br>  <br>  Throughout the movie Dottie was the big sister who only joined the league to get Kit in the league but Kit as you point out is a good player looking for that dare to be great moment that allows her to shine. Dottie went back to the series to show that she really did love the game but in the end she loved Kit more. The idea was to give Kit her moment in the sun and at the same time have one more game before going back to the farm and her husband.<br>  <br>  3.) Now, let's say Dotty didn't drop the ball on purpose. All through out the movie, Dotty's the strong player, and suddenly, during this very last scene Kit suddenly becomes strong enough to knock Dotty over to the point that Dotty loses the ball?<br>  <br>  Bad assumption. Kit's big moment in that scene is the fact that she even hit the ball. Kit was notorious for striking out on high fast balls. Kit hit the pitch. As for the ending of the play Kit was too small and totally awkward. She makes contact with Dotty but not the ball. Doty simply openned her hand and let the ball roll free.<br>  <br>  Can you help me make some sense of this ending? <br>  <br>  The sense is this. Dotty was going home with her husband but needed to get the game out of her system. She did. She wanted to win but in the end she chose to let her sister have the glory. She let her sister grow up. Watch the film again and you will see that Kit is trying to be one of the girls, the young girls, while Dotty is not as social, not as eager to impress. Dotty retires. Kit stays in the league and finds herself and finds her friends and her future husband. The league fit Kit. The game fit Dotty. The movie, however, was about the league.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	it was sad|`|zBkaqIWcaa	1) Dotty dropped the ball on purpose.<br>  2) Yes, to help Kit.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  Dotty had their life set,returning with her husband, not needing the baseball anymore.  Kit did not wanted to return to the farm, and by helping her, and letting her think she finally beat Dotty, Kit will develop the trust in herself to continue her career in baseball.<br>  <br>  3) Wrong, it was on purpose.<br>  <br>  Dotty loved her sister and wanted her to become the best she could.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	I felt that it was kicked from her hands. Dotty was too fierce of a competitor to "throw" a game, but Kit also has a point to make and this was Kit's chance to show that she could be her own woman and not live under Dotty's shadow.<br>  <br>  Life does what life does and the "best" person doesn;t always come out on top|`|IXz4j6tWaa	It's one of the best of the best, definitely in my personal top 20 faves of all time, right up there with stand by me and my girl.<br>  <br>  I'm so glad redbox introduced these classics again for a whole new generation who were little kids in the 90s to enjoy, and I'm only 28.|`|3dcc2948a003c40d98c8ef0d9a516e9baa	the ending tells you that, after all those years, it doesn't really matter.  they are all that is left who shares the memory of this really special thing.  the are the only females of their generation who were "professionals".  who dropped the ball, who didn't. who caught the ball, who won....doesn't matter.  after all these years, they are a symbol.  the fact that they PLAYED mattered.  they stood up and were counted.  they fought and tried to win--something women weren't supposed to do.  <br>  <br>  it means more to me now that I'm older.  I think it's left intentionally ambiguous because it doesn't matter.  she and her sister now share a common heritage--and she wouldn't trade that for anything.

I haven't heard The Monkeez yet.|`|U8aXa8xEaa	The Beatles. <br>  <br>  The Monkees started out as a T.V. Show.  The execs were trying to cash in on the popularity of the Beatles movie "A Hard Day's Night"  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles</a>|`|kyTBaYFlaa	LOL....The Monkees television show produced some great music but the Monkees were not a band. Only two of the four Monkees were musicians while the other two were actors. They did not have a drummer. Mickey Dolenz ( my favorite Monkee) was not a drummer.  They did not write their own songs and the albums were cut using studio musicians. The same tracks were used on the shows. The "live" concerts that they did involved considerable usage of prerecorded backing tracks and lip sync. I loved the Monkees music and the TV show and movies. I am a big fan of the Monkees but they are not a real band. The Beatles were 4 musicians and included two of the greatest songwriters ever. They recorded far more tracks than the Monkees and all 4 artists had successful solo careers in addition to their success as a band. The Beatles story, their success as a band, as well as their movies inspired the creation of the Monkees TV show.<br>  <br>  The following is an excerpt from wikipedia concerning the Monkees producers and the use of other musicians.<br>  <br>  The Candy Store Prophets were a 1960s rock band, headed by singer-songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. Their lineup included Boyce and Gerry McGee on guitar, Hart on keyboards, Larry Taylor on bass guitar and Billy Lewis on drums.<br>  After Boyce and Hart wrote and recorded the songs for the pilot episode of The Monkees, they were asked by the show's producers, Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, to name five 'professional' record producers who could create the music for the series, once it went into production. Their answer "Boyce and Hart, Hart and Boyce, Tommy and Bobby, Bobby and Tommy, TB & BH" was laughed off, Boyce and Hart contacted Screen Gems music supervisor Don Kirshner, who was put in charge of delivering the songs for the show, and asked to audition for him. Kirshner accepted, and was treated to a performance by the Candy Store Prophets, who delivered a nonstop set of all the songs Boyce and Hart had written to date for the Monkees. Kirshner was impressed, and officially named the pair as producers.<br>  The Candy Store Prophets recorded the bulk of the backing tracks for the first Monkees album, and for the show's first season, with help from guitarists Louie Shelton and Wayne Erwin. When the Monkees began to perform publicly late in 1966, the Prophets toured with them as their opening act.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Beatles, the Monkees were formed to counter them. They never were even a group until they were formed to put on television.|`|87CAVhs2aa	Personally I like The Beatles better.<br>  Then again, I'm overly obsessed with them.<br>  The Monkees are good, though, don't get me wrong.<br>  But The Beatles take the cake.|`|OnAoyAZFaa	Beatles|`|H7ENkTxaaa	The Alan Parsons Project.|`|7h0qfos1aa	I hope this isn't serious...<br>  <br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  <br>  THE BEATLES!!! wow! wow! do some research please.|`|v03M4OSBaa	are you serious? i mean really? the monkees? i mean they're not a bad band, but you are comparing them to one of the greatest bands ever to exist. THE BEATLES?|`|GqTSa85daa	The Beatles, the Monkees were considered a commercial Bubble Gum Group (Teenie Bopper Group, kinda like Hanna Montanna  and the Jonas Brothers).|`|4MVIJvbiaa	Mhm oh jeeze.<br>  Wow i havent listened to The Monkees in forever.<br>  They use to be my favorite.<br>   So im going with The Monkees.|`|uLelMuqZaa	The Beatles.

qC6pKCTnaa	Hey!<br>  <br>  I think the "big book" your talking about is the Civil War trade with the seven issues of Civil war. Thats the FULL main story but with all big comic book events now-a-days you will find other books that tie into the main Civil War story but are not necessary to the over all story.<br>  <br>  2. East? West? Civil War was not between who lives where.. it was between heroes who registered with the government and heroes who did not want to give up there identities. <br>  <br>  3. Iron man did win. I wanted Captain America to win because I believe heroes should be able to be free from the government if they do no harm.

FHBpJ3qvaa	there songs helped me thru some pretty bad times<br>  i was having some problems, and their songs helped me to keep going no matter what, that no matter what happens some one always cared for me.<br>  everytime something happens i listen to their songs and everything is better.|`|qLhtnommaa	spring nicht helped me out i lot.. but that's a very sensitive topic for me and i prefer not to discuss it ..=)|`|GSbz9Zq4aa	Break away/ich brech aus-<br>  The song thought me to just say "NO!!!"<br>  Jung und nicht mehr jungendfrei-<br>  I love this song, umm i think it basicly teaches others that you might be young but no longer treated as a young person, like growing up.<br>  Scream/schrei-<br>  same reason as for the break away song but, like, if your pressured inside, just scream it out loud?<br>  there are a LOT more songs, but these songs are the songs that are currently being a guiding light.|`|yJQzjjkvaa	I havent had personal experiences myself with their songs, except scream because i have always been the person to hold everything in, and not say what i think because i dont want to be misjudged, and i also thouht my opinion was less important than veryone else, and when i listened to the song i decided to be me and if people didnt like it then o well. Dont Jump and On the Edge helped out one of my friends that was thinking of suicide, and it is inspiring to think that anyone can accomplish their dream, TH went from an audience of 5 to who knows how many...|`|u25R7XIGaa	Don't Jump.<br>  <br>  And the little speech that Bill gave at the concert I went to... I think it was "believe in today, believe in tomorrow, believe in yourself, and whatever happens, don't jump." It came at a time when I swear, I didn't go ten minutes without thinking about how SAD I was and/or about suicide, and a few months after I started self-injury... "The world is down there, out of view" has inspired me no end because I can relate to it; when I'm upset enough to start cutting, I'm not thinking clearly and I can't remember anything except why I'm upset. The entire rest of the world is out there, I just can't see it right then, I've forgotten, you know? It reminds me that I'm not entirely in my right mind and gives me something to hang on to, even if it's only words. That line and "come take my hand and give it a chance," when I'm just... suicidal, remind me that it's not going to get any better if I don't give it a chance--my life isn't going to improve if I stop living it, and if I keep at it, I have a chance to make it meaningful.|`|F49y3gImaa	Ich Bin Nicht Ich...<br>  It inspired me to be a better sister because it made me realize how much of them they are of me.

The movie was out of the UK and it really didn't promoted very well here in the states, but it's definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen years.

You won't reget it.|`|K8a3a6PNaa	A scary movie or a funny movie would be best.

LgNqYUECaa	gay|`|uVbTJw9daa	Cheerleading started out as an all-male activity, but females began participating in 1923, due to limited availability of female collegiate sports.  In fact it was invented by  a man, and it was a different man that came up with one of the first cheers, and led a group of men in saying it. And no i don't think a man is automatically gay if he is a cheerleader. Women play basketball, baseball, football and many other sports that men play. Are they automatically lesbians?|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	Well, that's stereotypical to say one way or the other. I'd say the majority of them are gay, but I imagine if they had done it since they were a kid or something, and they are passionate about it they wouldn't necessarily have to be gay. Some get in it for the girls too.|`|x5dXU8vWaa	GAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|aecb4dafb246d2ba2a5f9769eed979b7aa	Either one some are just in it for the girls.|`|aXqi9lYJaa	I guess it varies lol|`|jxm3yEHRaa	thats stereotypical, mostly true...but not all are gay...im shure theres one or two out there...|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	UUmmmm.....that's a tough one.|`|Dob2OhIYaa	mostlikly: gayyyy<br>  but there is that possibility that they are just so desperate to be around/lifting/touching girls in short skirts that they joind <br>  (like the reason a bunch of these guys joined my schools gymnastics team, so they could check out hotties in tards)|`|2MnEOgb1aa	straight...........different answer.....|`|eO5lcohcaa	oooo..thats a toughyy..<br>  <br>  :D some are some aren't .. basically .. some do it to touch girls, some do it , well.. cuz they like it. :)|`|JDLSrtQZaa	G.A.Y.|`|LtBVfihPaa	lesbian!|`|qwInrvUGaa	he was prolly gay to begin with <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  im sure there are some straight male cheerleaders|`|ErjSVRkqaa	gay|`|evMd2CuIaa	Bi|`|VR5dGg4taa	the ones that are hetero are just there to look up girls skirts...lol|`|DS33Wl4waa	Gay.

T7AxIHFhaa	omg I hate people touching my face. True, I agreed with you. I hate to have pimples even BIG ZIT!|`|TyqGdBw1aa	go out into the woods for like a week. not camping, not RVing but more like surviving. it's the only way you'll ever get over it. and also accept the fact that germs are constantly on your skin. no matter what you do no matter how hard you try you will NEVER get the germs of you skin for long. within seconds your face is covered in germs even right after you clean your face.|`|AA10406285	Seriously?  Sorry, But I think you have a problem.<br>  ( i can't tell, by the way, whether it's the hands that you fear bacteria from or from your face itself. You say you don;t touch your own face unless it's sanitized???)|`|bJqS9GYOaa	It depends.   If its a really hot girl,  she can touch me where ever she wants.     But if its someone I do not like, or do not know, or is a coworker,     then they need to keep their hands to themselves.|`|Uv6fADcaaa	YES!<br>  <br>  But I hate it when people invade my personal space period!<br>  <br>  I don't want to be with in six inches of anyone!<br>  <br>  (only exceptions are a guy I'm sleeping with, and in a mosh pit... at least then I can push them back,lol.)|`|pR4Hwmpbaa	IMO, people shouldn't be touching your face anyways unless they are like your spouse or someone close to you like that. <br>  <br>  <br>  I don't mind a woman I'm seeing touching my face.

WJpJ6CVpaa	An aries capricorn is a pretty tough romantic combination, Aries. The forecast is for an uphill battle! Some astrologers might even say that this is the most unpleasant match in the zodiac! Your ruling planets — Mars and Saturn — are diametrically opposed forces. You’re extroverted, whereas Capricorn is introverted and shy, even sullen at times.<br>  <br>  Capricorns earthy practical side resonates very well with the matter-of-fact Taurean. Overall the two of you are very like-minded. Same elements of the zodiac always have a lot going for them and this is a great start to a relationship. As you are both earth elements, you will have a very solid grounding together. Straight away you will see a lot of yourself in each other.<br>  <br>  So definitely the Capricorn Taurus combo :)<br>  <br>  more info on it here <a href="http://www.astrology.com.au/compatibility/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.astrology.com.au/compatibilit...</a>|`|SlhdAZzpaa	capricorn and taurus...<br>  <br>  cuz both are earth signs..

AA10795350	It was terrific. Perfectly adapted from the graphic novel* (which is brilliant) and, in my opinion, the best superhero film ever. The cast was EXCELLENT and the visuals were stunning.<br>  <br>  * In fact, I thought the film's ending (though the film overall is faithful, one MAJOR element of the third act was changed) was an improvement over the graphic novels.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I believe "the mainstream" is going to hate the movie. =( People are going to go in expecting a shallow punch-'em-up and not get it.<br>  <br>  Proof: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq8q0s8OxqwqggOTLgv88JHSxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090306212159AAEwZ2W">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> Right, "no point." Ugh. The Watchmen story is loaded with meaning and commentary.|`|wTkvkWscaa	I really liked it. It was similar to the graphic novel, which I am a big fan of. I enjoyed it. Some of the soundtrack didn't fit well, the last sex scene was over the top, and a lot of the gory scenes were too Hollywood...but other than that, it was great. The actor who played Rorschach was incredible.|`|DXtyMRLuaa	I think the mistake here is everyone going in thinking its a typical hero movie like batman or spiderman when its really more along the lines of a sin city type movie. I loved it personally. I thought the visuals were stunning.|`|ygUXcmqDaa	yeah i just watched it and 'had' high expectations but they were totally shot. worst movie ive seen in a while.|`|BDEVP4qpaa	It was okay. Not as great as it couldv'e been, but it was average.|`|CZkOgzNiaa	Well, it is a great graphic novel.|`|wOc4Dqllaa	I thought it was actually really good. I loved the gritty feel of the whole film, and I thought the story and message were good. The fight scenes were ridiculous and overly drawn out, the Hallelujah sex scene was unnecessary, and the acting was sub-par, but overall I very much enjoyed it.<br>  <br>  When I saw it yesterday, there were three or four families their with LITTLE kids, like 6 and 7. The first ones left when Rorschach bashed the pedophiles head in with a meat cleaver, the last one stayed 'till the sex scene. I think they need to get an award for being sh*t parents.|`|7fEVNng5aa	I had very high expectations, simply because this is, IMO, the best superhero story ever written. I needed this film to be good, especially after Moores other works getting the typical Hollywood treatment. <br>  <br>  I was not disappointed. I'd say it stayed true to the graphic 95% of the time, lifting scenes, dialogues and monologues straight from the graphic. There wasn't a single character that left me wishing they'd casted someone else. Also, I thought the overall feel of the movie captured the feel of the comic book.<br>  <br>  For me it was 5 stars, 2 thumbs-up, Grade A, etc<br>  <br>  *semi-spoiler*semi-spoiler*semi-spoile...<br>  <br>  All that being said, my initial reaction towards the final scenes was "No! You made it this far by staying true, don't screw it up now!" Would it have been that much more difficult to keep the ending the same? IDK. I will reserve final judgment on the ending until I see it a few more times, though.|`|Rmy8bWnsaa	I loved it, I would agree that it's up there with the Dark Knight. A lot of people probably didn't like it because there was more dialogue than action. I also loved the soundtrack, I never would have thought I would hear Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan in a super hero movie! Although, they kind of ruined it at the credits, playing My Chemical Romance's horrible cover of Desolation Row..|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	ahh really? I just came back from the theaters, it was CRAP. I hated it. I'm sorry I wasted my money. I always loved the comic books, thought the movie might've been twice as better. Ugh dear God, I'm VERY disappointed. My boyfriend Kevin was just pissed. We both were.|`|k0QRfQ00aa	I didn't like it :( I had high expectations for it but it jumped the gun a lot to me. The special effects were great the storyline not so great but Malin Ackerman did a good job.|`|fWclxi9Baa	it was decent i didnt waste my money

Any man that hits a woman is so low and deserves no woman at all. And a woman that goes back to a man that hits her is pretty pathetic.|`|DNknBxRWaa	I think chris learned his lesson.<br>  <br>  People shouldn't try and keep them apart, if they love eachother they will work through it.<br>  <br>  SHAME on people trying to split them up!!!<br>  Let them make there own decisions, They're grown adults|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	I couldnt care less. she's not the first woman to go back to an abusive man, she wont be the last. Her life, her business. If she wants to be his punching bag, who are we to say anything.|`|YNKyEk4faa	I think it was a personal choice...and she realized that everyone makes mistakes no matter how small or big.|`|0sZQ8xxIaa	its just so shoking.<br>  why would she do that to herself ? :[|`|c8TXAAj1aa	dumb, hope he does not kill her.|`|VAfyKWmUaa	I can't really answer that simply bc it's her decision. I wouldn't do it. Once a man hits you, he'll do it again. When I seen her face, I said to myself Whoa..... I would have killed his a--. He has issues for real. But when a (boy)child see's his Mom getting beat all the time, they think that's natural. It's not, he needs help. It isn't that much love in the world for me to allow a man to beat me like that, nor hit me. To each his own though.<br>  <br>  And yes it's Bobby and Whitney all over again, for real. Lmao<br>  It's really not funny at all though, I totally agree with you, she's too intelligent. But if she likes it, I love it. Only she can get tired of the abuse, ya know?|`|621af0f098099c92f52aa36d2f3c318eaa	Well i don't think the whole story and what every one is saying is all true, i mean of course they had a domestic altercation..but who are we to judge or assume any thing, It is vfery wrong to hit a woman very wrong. But these 2 are so young and there lives are so open and every one is watching there every step and critics it has to be crazy-but i guess thats what you get for living the hollywood life style. I'm sure there are and were many more incidents of stars beating on each other not all caught and reported.<br>  also when you love and care for some one the feelings can not just disappear, only time will tell what will become of the 2. I hope Rihanna can get back to her life and music, as for Chris well......<br>  She's a beautiful person with a hectic life, I hope people will stop trying to get there stories and photo and leave her alone.|`|rdoMe0ywaa	IDK...I wish she didnt. but who knows maybe he will NOT do it again<br>  <br>  Answer mines if you want, also about Rihanna.

I believe the only reason a woman would stay with someone who abused her so badly is something that is broken inside of her.  She must have some self esteem issues or something.  It's sad and I believe he should serve some time for his actions.|`|jw8Ylipjaa	yup,Disgusting. Any man that hits a woman is so low and deserves no woman at all. And a woman that goes back to a man that hits her is pretty pathetic. i would never go back to a guy who abuses me/ smacks me /chokes me /or hit me!|`|j7ZIK7imaa	we just watched a movie on this at school.

I have no idea why she would go back with someone like that. I believe in "once an abuser, always an abuser". I think he'll probably do it again, and when he does, I hope she learns her freakin' lesson. She's definitely going to have to learn the hard way. I definitely think it's bobby and whitney all over again.|`|4Pj0ksZRaa	well what i personally think about Rhianna staying with chris is that she is being a little bit too dumb and stupid because After what he did to her and actually destroy her face and got her very injured i think that she should move on and forget about him and find somebody else who doesn't abuse her.|`|qgDBnGhfaa	well honestly i think all of this is getting blown out of proportion.<br>  literally if anyone else did this it would be a blow off and not cared about at all- which i think is totatly rediculious. some of the stuff does not even many any sense but whatever.<br>  <br>  if your in love you in love. <br>  its her decision and no one elses. so who cares.|`|soFzO7C2aa	so annoyed with it and have you heard that they are going to go around to schools and organizations and talk about domestic dating violence and their writing a book. talk about a dissaster.|`|uiNhXT3iaa	I think she only got back with him so that people would back off of Chris Brown and won't think that he's such a bad, bad guy.

First, you think it's your fault, that he's just stressed or sick, you have to take care of him. Also after a fight, he might come back with flowers and sweet promises that it will never happen again and maybe he'll even be nice for a while. Then it starts again, and she blames herself for ruining the relationship.<br>  <br>  No matter how rich or popular you are, the same problems come into play. She needs the support of good friends and to move out on her own. Also restraining orders, sadly, are not very effective.<br>  <br>  Edit - I just read all the answers! My god! What is wrong with you people?! She may act tough, sexy and in control, but trust me, celebrities wear that mask all the time. In reality they are just as frail and unsure as all of us. <br>  She is in an abusive relationship, once she figures that out, the long road to healing begins. Locking him up in jail will solve nothing, he needs therapy and anger management.<br>  <br>  She needs to love her self first before she even thinks about letting another man in her life.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	once a man hits you it will be good for a few months or so but it will happen again,its like a cheater,,she is scared and blames her self for him hitting her,that's the way women do when they are abused,they think they are the ones who did something wrong,i hope she will be ok,,and think twice before she stays with him.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	She's got the next beating coming to her.|`|fyyfPEemaa	Wow people.

UBHKVOEwaa	Kendra was the first to announce she was going to leave. She had begun to date Hank Baskett. She said in an interview (google it) that she used to have to sneak out of the mansion for sex and she hardly ever saw Hefner, mostly just in passing. She also went on to say that mansion staff had to keep a log of what the girls were doing when they were not with Hef and out of the mansion and that Hef would obsess over it.<br>  Bridget left to do her travel show but I think she was still planning to stay after her show finished shooting. When she discovered the other two were leaving for good she probably realized her time was up there.<br>  Holly started seeing Chris Angel and it's obvious she was seeing him while still at the mansion-dressing like him for mardi gras and her underwater photoshoot in which she was chained up (an escape trick many magicians do). Holly and Chris have since broke up.|`|KDqzj3isaa	hi i have been following this alot lol. holly hooked up with criss angel they are now a full on couple she was cheating and hef was upset but understood that she wants kids and marriage and he cant give her babies and kendra is getting married to hank bassett  NFL star in july rumored at the playboy mansion she fell for him when she was with hef and told him on the show and it was all good,he said he understood. and bridget is on a travel show now and hef replaced them with three more girls for season 6. twins and a playboy model.|`|7QN9wetGaa	heff found out tht <br>  holly was going out with cris angel nd stuff.<br>  she was all bummed out cuz she wanted to <br>  get married nd have children nd heff couldnt<br>  give her tht.<br>  nd kendra was jst young nd would always go out once<br>  in a while to get some cuz idk she was the horny<br>  one until she found love with a football player from the<br>  eagles. nd bridget was the last one to move out<br>  idk why she did though|`|iy8C03vaaa	just like every girl he's ever been with has left the mansion..these 3 were just famous cuz of tv....hes the kind of being a pimp...he always waits till a girl is too "old" and finds a fresh 18 year old...or he gets bored and moves on...believe me it wasnt their idea...he lets them stray and leave...cuz he has plenty more fresh meat to move in|`|JRRsjByCaa	i believe the main girl left because she knew they would never have kids and she wanted a family...the youngest one is in a relationship with a guy in the nfl and is engaged i believe. but i'm not sure about the other.<br>  <br>  <br>  i watch too much TMZ, ugh!|`|WIXH1OFVaa	I don't think we'll ever know the truth.<br>  It wouldn't surprise me if he had them on contracts.

And on top of that, the old fart is dating twins, who are several years younger than the 3. I am surprised they did not leave long ago. I dated a woman much younger than I am, less than half my advanced age of 55 at the time. It was great, what an ego boost. The problem ended up being our lives were too far apart in life experiences and our circles of friends just did not overlap enough. So, we split. And then, a year or so later, I started dating her mother... It was a bit strange, walking up to the same front door. Anyway, I see nothing different about the girls next door. They are too young, and he is way TOO old. Aren't the 3 girls mid-20's (the twins are about 20, right?) and he is what, late 70's? The way he cackles instead of laughing has always rubbed me wrong. He has become the epitome of the classic dirty old man, a caricature of himself! A joke! I have to admit, I only watched a few episodes here and there, not a regular viewer, but still, it seems obvious to me. One thing has always bothered me about Kendra, her face when she laughs, never moves from her nose up and her laugh always sounds forced. It is like she has had recent botox injections. Watch her face and see for yourself. She does not smile with her whole face like everyone else I know, except for a select few who use botox... I have a feeling there will be a special in the near future, something about the 3 girls next door "tell all" or some such. After all, isn't that the kind of thing they do on other series like the bachelor? Have an aftershow with all the rejects who then go on to complain about the raw deal they got and reveal all the scandals? Reality TV shows such as this never cease to amaze me... I do not watch on a regular basis, because I simply can not take the fakery that goes on. My question is, why do they have writers in the credits if this is supposedly "reality"?|`|bRPnUMM4aa	-Holly Madison left.

For example, it's illegal to drive while under the influence of alcohol, and if they did legalize marijuana, I believe that it should be the same way. I also believe that there should be a certain age that one has to be in order to possess it. (I know that doesn't stop many people, but still, it would give the critics less of a reason to blast it). <br>  <br>  I don't think that marijuana is an extremely harmful drug, as long as people are smart about it. Besides, when you get down to it, the effects of alcohol (judgment being impaired, etc.) are just the same as the effects of smoking pot, and alcohol is legal for of-age people - why not marijuana too? Of course being high and being drunk are a different feeling, but if people can learn to be smart about alcohol, then they can be smart about marijuana also.<br>  <br>  Besides, when you strip it all down to the basics, the only reason it hasn't been legalized yet is because it can't be regulated (read: taxed) by the government because people can grow it on their own. If the government did legalize and regulate it, then they'd have more money, at the very least.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	Absolutely.  If alcohol is legal, why can't mj be legal?  There are far more people addicted to alcohol than pot.  I'm not a proponent of drug use, but marijuana is no more harmful than having a beer or glass of wine.  And, it's not a "gateway" drug.  If anything, cigarettes and alcohol are far more addicting.<br>  <br>  P.S. - you can't die from an overdose of pot.  Only if some dumbass laces it with something.|`|pR4Hwmpbaa	No way. <br>  <br>  Look at all the problems we have with booze being legal. If they made pot legal the govt. would do the same thing with it that they do with booze and cigarettes. They would regulate how strong the product would be allowed to be and most potheads wouldn't like the milder form of commercial pot they would be able to legally buy. These people would still buy the illegal, more potent stuff, anyways. <br>  <br>  Of course, you'll never get the dopers to understand any of this reasoning.

Stop putting harmless potheads in prison and letting the rapists and child molestors out early to make room for them.|`|lbQYYHMbaa	No because it's not a life essential/natural desire and it causes no good or productivity, just follow the laws that make up this great country we live in|`|AA11119892	It should because it feels good but honestly, it shouldn't be because there would be wayyy too much chaos.|`|3bLNyHIgaa	no cause it would be so dangerous having a bunch of high people Driving around and working in hospitals and daycare ect...|`|UukCr0RPaa	Nope.<br>  America already has a problem with addiction.|`|ONTzkwSqaa	no becuase people are disgusting hobos, who need lives instead of taking them :)|`|vlvOkbaAaa	No, because it's a dangerous drug.|`|j7ZIK7imaa	for medical purposes at hospitals and thats about it.|`|QE71sNC3aa	No...

I would like to encourage everyone to check the facts about weed before making these outlandish statements!<br>  Let's get the facts straight people:<br>  Marijuana does not cause profound changes in people's behavior.<br>  Marijuana does not cause physical dependence. <br>  There have been no reports of lung cancer related solely to marijuana, and in a large study presented to the American Thoracic Society in 2006, even heavy users of smoked marijuana were found not to have any increased risk of lung cancer. <br>  Marijuana does not cause people to use hard drugs. <br>  In 1995, based on thirty years of scientific research editors of the British medical journal Lancet concluded that "the smoking of cannabis, even long term, is not harmful to health."<br>  College students who use marijuana have the same grades as nonusers. Among high school students, heavy use is associated with school failure, but school failure usually comes first.<br>  Dutch policy has not resulted in dramatically escalating cannabis use.<br>  None of the medical tests currently used to detect brain damage in humans have found harm from marijuana, even from long term high-dose use.<br>  There is no convincing evidence that heavy long-term marijuana use permanently impairs memory or other cognitive functions.<br>  Almost all human and animal studies show that marijuana decreases rather than increases aggression.<br>  <br>  And so on... THC is safer and more useful than alcohol and tobacco and legalization would let the gov get a cut of the profit AND standardize the quality etc.  It would also be helpful in treating various medical conditions.  <br>    <br>  If you have a hard time swallowing any of my facts, please go to my source.  If you still have problems swallowing my facts, check out the primary references listed on the site.  <br>  :)|`|wkKmVGenaa	Hell yeah, to one of the people on here who thinks keeping it illegal  cause kids can't get their hands on them is really stupid.<br>  Kids get there hands on them all the time much more easier than alcohol, cause drug dealers make huge profits off of kids right in school stupid! which would lead to harder drugs as well, anyone against legalizing is supporting the drug dealers and cartels, and all those innocent lives being killed over in mexico. That shows how stupid all of you are thinking it should be illegal, do yourselfs all a favor and do some research. Besides anyone else against this doesn't deserve freedom of choice, cause all you haters feel that every little right should be given away, your founder fathers will be ashamed of all you haters.|`|H16yufK6aa	I should be!!! Everyone in the world would just sit around watching cartoons and eating fruit loops all day, and we would never have to fight. I am also allergic to it so I cant smoke it, but I think its a good idea, and just like cigs you should have to be 18 to buy it. Its not the drug thats bad its the people that smoke it, they use it as an excuse to be mean to others. Just like alcohol!!!!|`|Y0PStoa1aa	I don't think so. It might be a natural drug, but it's still dangerous. We aleady have too many crazy a$$es out there, and making it legal may make them feel as though they have more of a right to smoke and drive, or smoke and act like an idiot like they usually do.|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	Yes.<br>  And, if you don't want to smoke it (because marijuana is much, much higher in the cancer-causing tars than those highly addictive cigarettes), COOK with it.

If Marijuana were to be legalized the government would no longer be in debt... They could tax it and quit spending tax payer money trying to do away with it...<br>  <br>  <br>  Just my opinion....Thank you!|`|SUOsfKYdaa	no itz dangeourous n i lost my uncle from an overdose so no it should NOT be legallized|`|MSDlHrMTaa	legalize it|`|S9jmWU7Yaa	UHHHH no, cuz it's terrible for your health and it ruins people's lives.|`|lOR7CH0waa	Absolutley not.

While that lasted, he treated her like royalty and disapproved of her partying ways.  Once he moved on to the next best thing, Andy didn't really care what happened to her until he found out she'd overdosed.<br>  <br>  While Andy Warhol never directly enabled Edie Sedgwick's drug and alcohol abuse, it is just as easy to say that if Edie had not become his muse, she wouldn't have been caught up in that lifestyle.

Friends should be trusted and this shows she can't be.|`|uiKAI8bWaa	"Sunsetdrunk" has some good points Nix.<br>  We can be just as angry with people when they don't tell us stuff, even though it was supposed to be a secret.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	denounce her as my friend and move on. Once the secret is out, there's nothing you can do about it except deny stuff. Anyway, if you haven't done so yet, don't tell your friend nor your sis if you know your secret is not safe....or else you'll seriously regret it, or forever will be paranoid if whether it did get spread around town. Your choice.|`|AA10471659	That is easy, you don't tell anyone but a contact that has no axe to grind. It works fine. I know that the info goes nowhere from them or what they tell me. Use a contact not on yahoo answers though,silly.|`|vMeSBnE1aa	never trust that person and keep my secrets to myself.<br>  <br>  remember, a secret shared is no longer a secret.|`|WbKBHh8Haa	you learn quickly|`|AA11922229	Why have secrets? Act as if you're telling everyone when you speak to one. Technically it's like broadcasting. Most of it is gossip anyway. I know this is difficult, but try not to be drawn up in the gossip, or perpetuate the gossip. Some people make it an occupation to create gossip or translate gossip to serve their interests. Some people are just down right sadistic when it comes to trashing others. Some people are just down right stupid and not aware of the damage they can do. Get busy using your mind for constructive things. People will know you for it, and the good energy will bounce back. Encourage yourself to be better, and encourage others too. It's a great skill that takes years to develop. Gossip short circuits creative energy. It's a choice you have control over. Emotional energy is wasted, so, just forgive and brush it off.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	You should write it in a journal and keep it locked and hidden, and obviously they have issues, but I wouldn't consider that one a friend and I have no idea what to do about your sister.|`|09YH28Fuaa	i tell them they are a backstabber and i cant trust them again and then i never tell anything to any of my friends aagain only to familia!|`|qy07K2k5aa	I would feel many emotions, hurt, confused, disappointed, angry, etc.|`|FdRGuMKraa	Don't tell secrets to anyone.

xXa3eQOeaa	The Valkyrie's Angel. The Valkyrie's Treasure.<br>  If she's a brunette, like Claudia: The Dark Valkyrie.<br>  <br>  The writers already screw-up character "histories". So now YOU want to add to it!?<br>  Please, if you "do" this, do not re-write the existing "history". Make it a storyline for sometime in the future. To do that, you'd have to make Spinelli to be sort of like an Uncle-type for Arianna.(such a beautiful name, the Yahoo spell-check doesn't like it though, as if we care what IT "likes"!)|`|Agw4pXAnaa	Haha, interesting, I like it.  Personally, I wish we could see more of Ric, I like him and I think him and Claudia make a good pair.

I had a good dream, once though.<br>  <br>  I was thinking about zombies when I was falling asleep, and I came to think about what I would do when zombies came. The perfect zombie plan, it replayed like a movie (with no dramatic ending) in my dream.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Simply, I was at school, and zombies were reported clawing at the front doors on the other side of the building. I knew that they weren't everywhere yet, so I had a chance. I was with my two best friends, I secretly called my dad, and he parked behind the school. We escaped the building and ran to the car, no encounters yet. <br>  <br>  We raced to the wal-mart about a mile away, and basically made the perfect barricade. I have it planned out, not going to explain the whole thing... it's in the zombie plan. It allowed intelligent people in and out, but zombies stuck outside. Once we set up these barricades, all of our parents got to the outside and we let them in. We set up the perfect fortress and lived for 3 years until we were rescued by a new world order.<br>  <br>  We lived simply, like we slept in the bedding section of the store, etc. etc. we made the place very comfortable. It was the perfect situation. We could even watch the zombies from the roof, where they couldn't get us. There were millions outside the store, and they couldn't get inside.|`|Q6NARgG0aa	hey...im a blonde..and i might be offended!just joking=)<br>  <br>  stopping by to like totally say like hi..like omg...haha!how ya doin bradley.im on my 4th or 5th account-so im adding you again!|`|yXB5LOE2aa	No. I heard about how they practice black magic in Haiti today, so that freaked me out as much.|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	nope.

qC6pKCTnaa	The comic book industry is slowly dieing because people bootleg stuff online. The current Uncanny X-men title is a really great read and is making me feel better about all the M day stuff that has happened in the last few years. <br>  <br>  If you want to read these stories and more go to your local comic book shop and actually buy the comics themselves so you can support the industry. To find your local shop go to <a href="http://www.comicshoplocator.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.comicshoplocator.com</a><br>  <br>  Look, i know this is not what you want to hear but please give it some thought. Nothing is like the feeling you get when you lay down on your best with a bag full of comic books on a Wednesday!|`|5LiXKwVOaa	Depends if you want the recent ones or the old ones. If you want everything up to 2005 you can always get the 40 years of X-Men cd which for only 30 bucks gives you 400 issues plus annuals. If you're looking for the newer issues then I'm sure you can find some torrents for them online.

The site is designed for everyone who seriously wants to stop smoking, and it's free.<br>  <br>  "It doesn’t matter if you are a five a day teenager, or a one hundred a day pensioner, male or female, or if this is your first or fiftieth attempt at stopping - if you really want to stop smoking then this is the site for you."|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	What are your alternatives?   You keep smoking, and you will die of some horrible complication correlated to smoking.<br>  <br>  I know it's really hard habit to break.  The addiction of nicotine is like that of heroine.  It's severe, and should not be taken lightly.<br>  <br>  You are making a choice to live or die.  I've seen too many people affected.  And, the only people that will disagree and give me a stupid thumbs down, are those who are addicted to nicotine.<br>  <br>  So - Yes. Quit.|`|dbkQhA2Qaa	Yes, because smoking destroys your body.  My husband has PAD which is caused by smoking and has all but destroyed the circulation in his legs.  He also is being treated for the same cancer and the gentleman from the Monkees bank.  It is rare and not curable....only controllable for a short while...3 to 5 years and then you are a goner.  Smoking can destroy your young life and my husband would gladly have never started if he had had a crystal ball.  He is only 61 and things are really tough right now.|`|ei6JS0B6aa	Well, if you want your lungs to turn black(if they haven't already), get a hole in your neck, and/or have an ugly wrinkled face that makes you look way older than sure...keep smoking.|`|2bKgIMSsaa	Yes!! Keep trying. Eventually you will succeed. That's what I did, even though it took me years. It's worth it when you finally succeed.<br>  Have faith in yourself.

It's up to you.|`|USooqQlWaa	I quit when I got pregnant with my first son and then smoked a little between the pregnancies and stopped again with my second pregnancy.  I smoked again just a little after my last son was born but now haven't smoked in a couple years.  I have more cash and I can breathe.  But I never found it so addicting that I couldn't quit...I would smoke more around friends and when I was around friends that didn't smoke I found myself not smoking.  That actually does help.  You should try if you want to...it's really not as cool as people think it is.|`|9NLe96auaa	if you dont' really wnat to quit then dont' bother. yes it would be better for your health cuz the things they put in cigarettes are nasty things like CLR, urine, tar, etc., but if your heart isn't behind quitting then you won't succeed so you might as well not try.|`|CHGTbgOmaa	absolutely. its always always awlays worth a shot. most people dont understand that smoking doesnt only cause lung cancer. it also causes aneurysms and heart failure. please quit. ive watched someone die from it. dont you want to live to see your grandchildren>|`|5EKAkqgAaa	my dad almost died of lung cancer 8 years ago.

My Vietnamese friend ate rice and soy sauce together I and I was so surprised. It turns out that Japanese soy sauce and Vietnamese soy sauce is different. I guess it depends on the culture and the taste of the sauce.|`|JvBGKmpyaa	Yes, I often do!  <br>  <br>  Makes it more interesting, though it depends on what I'm eating with the rice.

You can customize more, including your layout, background, color scheme, music, etc... It's used to let people see your personality.<br>    Facebook is more for people at the college age and above. You can't customize your profile that much, and unless you don't have some friends, it will take awhile to get accustomed to. I'ts used more to let people know about your beliefs/values/ and share common interests. "Networking" is available in Facebook, in which you can connect with others around your area. It's also a little more organized. Plus, Facebook is arguably safer. <br>    Both have the "friendship" thing, except in Facebook, you don't order the friends (which can be good or bad depending on the situation). Also the applications/games are similar. <br>    My advice to you is to get a Facebook ONLY if you know some(preferably many) of your friends already have one, it will be a lot more entertaining that way.|`|rLfzMvvDaa	They're both meant for the same reason although in myspace you can customize your profile and make it your own way! But my friends like it a lot... If i were you i would try both. see which one you like more or see which one has more of your friends!|`|defeBgqdaa	they are different<br>  they both have there ups and downs<br>  personally i prefer facebook, i deleted my myspace a long time ago|`|8Q5WlMV1aa	I would say both, but myspace is more for there layout paages and customizations.|`|bqUy7MKTaa	fb|`|NzOaspmkaa	facebook!|`|30SnAm0kaa	myspace. <br>  <br>  i don't have facebook but it seems too plain|`|V7WyjxUSaa	HAHA.<br>  <br>  neither.<br>  <br>  come on.

It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama ranks 30th in total land area and ranks second in the size of its inland waterways. The state ranks 23rd in population with almost 4.6 million residents in 2006.[4]<br>  <br>  From the American Civil War until World War II, Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. White rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and African Americans were underrepresented.[5] In the years following World War II, Alabama experienced significant recovery as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing, mineral extraction, education, and high technology, as well as the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations, primarily those of the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force. Today, the state is heavily invested in aerospace, education, health care, and banking, and various heavy industries including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and fabrication.<br>  <br>  Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, which is also the name of the state bird. Alabama is also known as the "Heart of Dixie". The state tree is the Longleaf Pine, the state flower is the Camellia. The capital of Alabama is Montgomery, and the largest city by population is Birmingham. The largest city by total land area is Huntsville. The oldest city is Mobile.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	Margera.|`|jUEoujN2aa	my wife and kids when michael joins the gym|`|AA10026476	Bring a Mask|`|ybwqYZ1waa	That cheesy, old disney show,"That's so raven."|`|r8s5j6zOaa	Emeril Lagasse|`|oMj8WAHFaa	that little dude from flintstones bam bam i think i forgot.|`|BivatwC5aa	emerel<br>  or whatever the chef's name is|`|DjbCw7ePaa	A Myspace friend of mine.|`|CArzkDIUaa	the spray stuff|`|mBlcD6sRaa	fred flintstone|`|dShUF6A9aa	Big Ben

GwpMPfBSaa	Don't worry, by the time you go back to English class nobody will probably even remember, I don't think I would.  Even if they do they are not going to remember it for long.  So just chill and relax, plus you may have actually done really well on the test and your worrying for nothing.  There is no point in worring about it now because it will just ruin your whole weekend and you can't change the past.  You might be embarrassed for awhile, but it really is not a big deal, just remember not to brag too much next time.|`|JjTfFD07aa	Ya that'd be funny. :) It's okay. These things happen. We do stuff we realize AFTER we did it that we shoun't have done it. No worries. Tomorrow will come, then the next day, then the next day. And it'll be forgotten. Don't worry about it. <br>  <br>  :)|`|kA7GEKf7aa	lmao that was stupid. It's funny though so I don't think your teacher will mind.|`|aXqi9lYJaa	chill lol|`|AA10152422	FYI: There are no A+ in English.

You shouldn't have done that!|`|uqlAx5mJaa	Well it's really not that big of a deal if you don't.|`|caExWxHbaa	get over it

And yes, it's just terrible. But changing for normal gym isn't that bad. I'm one of the few girls who actually participate and run and whatnot so it's a relief to change. (:<br>  <br>  Besides, it's like changing for sports. You get used to it.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I didn't know schools actually had gym class anymore.  I'm assuming that's what you're referring to anyway.

Naruto hasn't been going anywhere since Shippuden started other than the fact Naruto's training, some people died, and Sasuke hates Konoha. Kishimoto even admitted the whole second half is basically 'character development'. Plus, Naruto was butchered when it was dubbed and they won't even dub Shipudden.<br>  <br>  Q2. Hmm, I've been thinking about this for a while. I've decided 'Boshi Boshi Mental'. I even have a pretty decent plot behind it to.<br>  <br>  Q3. It depends. i think its based on the sterotype that men like girls with large breasts -which downgrades the worth of women, making our worth only equal to our boob size- so they try to attract more guys with the boobs. Either that and/or they're perverted.<br>  <br>  Q4. In a way they are. There's not as much details in the pictures as there use to but its become much higher quality in coloring and effects. In a way, they've improved more than degraded.<br>  <br>  Q5. Hmm, I don't know. One Piece, Bleach, OHHC, Vampire Knight, ect are all doing good but they're actually getting somewhere (especially One Piece, but then again it was awesome from the start) and basically all the series thatsuck are already going through a holocaust.

You are only as poor as you allow yourself to be. I would never be ashamed.|`|JV0i77uiaa	I used to, but not anymore.

You see, psychologically speaking, yes you will develop pride and probably learn things other people wouldn't know. But generally if you are poor, sociologically speaking that is--it means your family is not well educated --and that will definitely hurt your pride and might even make you feel embarrassed. <br>  <br>  There's many things you won't be able to do, first of all, defining poor as having less than "normal." It means you will be left out in some social events, meetings, gatherings, etc.  But after all that, it'll just give you more encouragement to change right?<br>  <br>  But don't be discouraged, if there's one place in the world that gives you the ability to change your status at all, if any, would be America.|`|OLcXtWQyaa	i was born into a poor family. sometimes when i was younger i was ashamed of it, but now i'm glad actually because if i'd grown up well-to-do i'd probably have been a real bast***.|`|NuXzyLTlaa	No. I would work hard to get excellent grades or be really athletic in school, get a scholarship for college, get a good job and make a name for myself.

Poor families are just as capable of raising decent human beings as anyone else.    nothing to be ashamed of about that.

Not one person is better than the other, for any reason. A person's income level is immaterial.

2a9jRZGRaa	I called mine Sex<br>  <br>  Everybody who has a dog calls him either Rover or Boy. I called mine Sex. Now Sex is a very embarassing name.<br>  <br>  One day I took Sex for a walk and he ran away from me. I spent hours looking for the dog. A cop came over to me and said, "What are you doing in this alley at 4:00 in the morning?" I said, "I'm looking for Sex." My case comes up Thursday.<br>  <br>  One day I went to City Hall to get a dog license and told the clerk, "I would like to have a license for Sex!" He said, "I would like to have one too." Then I said, "But this is a dog." And he said he didn't care how she looked. Then I said, "You don't understand. I had Sex since I was two years old." He said, "You must have been a very strong baby."<br>  <br>  I told the Judge that when my husband and I separated, we went to Court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, "Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married." And...the Judge said, 'Me too." Then I told him that after I was married, Sex left me. And he said, "Me too." When I told him that I had Sex on TV, he said "Showoff." I told him that it was a contest and he told me I should have sold tickets.<br>  <br>  I also told the Judge about the time when my husband and I were on our honeymoon and we took the dog, Sex. When I checked into the motel, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for my husband and I and a special room for Sex. The clerk told me that every room in the motel was for sex. Then I said, "You don't understand, Sex keeps me awake at night." And the clerk said, 'Me too.".....I give up !!!!|`|RrlXWz2uaa	Me!<br>  <br>  Two cannibals eating a clown, one says to the other, "Does this taste funny to you?"  Bum!

RMh0a3DSaa	YESS.<br>  The night before my driving test for my driving license i had a dream about this crazy old lady who would scream outside our house in the middle of the night and knock on our door and then run away. But not a normal scream, like a terrifying really loud scream. Eesh still gives me the creeps. But anyways she screamed so loud and i was so scared that i never got any sleep. SO the whole time i was dreaming i was stressing about not sleeping and stressing how to get rid of this crazy person. I woke up totally stressed from things that weren't even real! haha :)<br>  <br>  But the worst is when Im stressed and I can't sleep at all. And the clock is really slow and my mind is going over all the events that happened to me that day and I just want to yell "stop thinking!!" but I can't... I hatee those nights.|`|nooi0ldjaa	when i have hard day's i tend to only sleep a few hours, like 3-4.<br>  <br>  but i never really dream anymore. and when i do, normally im getting chased by something o.O<br>  <br>  answer - nope, that doesn't happen to me.|`|2dPqad7Eaa	I stay calm at most times so I don't show my stress much but I do have nightmares every once in a while when that happens|`|HBiStvacaa	yes|`|bgbUQ3Wnaa	omg! for real this happend the last few nights because for lunch i had to stay in with this super mean teacher to finish work. and when other things such as my love (never leaves my head.) are on my mind, i can barely sleep or i have scary dreams. i had a strange dream last night where i was a sim character and i was making out with this dude, and then i cheated on him with a colored guy. it was weird.|`|OegheALwaa	yeah i cant sleep either. <br>  and i get a headache and feel really full. and just like so pressured and then what always happens it just goes away like i say screw this it isn't even important.|`|uLelMuqZaa	Occasionally, but not always.

I've found that taking time the next morning to go over the dream, and figure out what my subconscious trying to tell me, gives me a better night's sleep the next time.  This works for me even if the cause of the stress is still there.  Somehow just putting a finger on what is bothering me really helps.|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	I just had some jerk that lives in this place stalk me a few weeks ago. He's in a wheel chair and pushes the thing with one foot. He makes a tapping sound as he's going along. All that keeps going threw my mind is that horrible tapping sound.

Makes me jump out of bed in cold sweats.|`|qJK4alwQaa	i had a dream about getting my permit and i was driving home from the mall with mr miyagi in the front seat directing me.

Hope the below article will provide you with more info... <br>  ?<br>  Why are some people more successful than others in fulfilling their goals and  dreams? Isn’t it astonishing how some people fail all the time, while others  turn everything they touch into gold? <br>    Is it just dumb luck?  Does God rule over it?  Are some born with successful and predetermined genes?  How To Set Your Success Formula on Autopilot? <br>    Setting goals and  in your life is the single most  undertaking in the entire process of making the life you always dreamed about. Can you imagine that almost 95% of all masses simply don't do this? And the balance of the 5% do it, but only 10% of this small number ever reach their goals. This is the reason why so many masses struggle and businesses fail.<br>   <br>   Tap Into the Infinite Power of Your subconscious mind <br>   <br>   Your subconscious processes about 400 billion bits of information per second and the impulses move at a speed of up to 100,000 mph! Equate this to your conscious mind, which processes only about 2,000 bits of information per second and its impulses move only at 100-150 mph.  Your conscious mind is almost a backward cousin of the subconscious mind.  I am sure you have experienced at some time or another driving you car, and for an instant during the drive, you suddenly became aware that you were driving. Prior to that sudden conscious jolt into the present moment, your conscious mind was busy with thinking and your subconscious mind drove the car – all on its own.<br>   <br>   You might have the firmest desire to achieve something, but as long as your subconscious holds a certain feeling that is not aligned with that desire, nothing will ever happen to manifest the desire.  This is the single most important fact you have to understand. You set your goals with your conscious mind and you reach them with your subconscious mind.The single most important thing to realize is that you set your goals with your conscious mind and you reach them with your subconscious mind.<br>   <br>   There is now a remarkably simple solution for manifesting your goals, dreams and desires in life.  It's called the Dream Manifestation Wizard, an award winning software application that supports and steers you in manifesting exactly what you want. A simple and highly efficient process, using the power of your intention combined with dynamic images and your own voice, to re-program your mind for instant and lasting Success.<br>   <br>   The Most Remarkable Way to Rewire Your Brain <br>   <br>   Unlock the latent power inside you to manifest lasting changes in your life and society.

I usually pray and fall right off to sleep.|`|aIEezfgaaa	i have nightmares and start talking in my sleep|`|AA10671142	many times I can't sleep either when I am stressed out|`|dPgP28Aiaa	I don't have bad dreams when I'm upset or stressed, I just have them at random times. Like last night for example, I had a dream that I got out of bed, and there was this HUGE, and I mean huge spider standing in my doorway. >_>
zgL6vMCiaa	if im gonna ask every person who hear music:<br>  WHAT DO U PREFER? LISTENNING TO QUOURAN? <br>  <br>  OR <br>  LISTENNING TO MUSIC?<br>  <br>  <br>  ALLAH(swt) knows best, but every person who listen to music will choose music, and thats bcz simply, the heard love one thing:<br>  the heart who love music cant love quouran but the clean heart who listen to quouran will definetely feel happiness and calm and peace when he listen quouran.<br>  <br>  and thats why music is from shaytan...satan make u by many little steps make u choose music? why? by jealousy, satan want us to leave quouran which is WORDS OF ALLAHZ(swt) and choose music...in other words, satan want us to leave ALLAH(swt)...<br>  and if u read quouran u'll know that satan promised ALLAH(swt) (NO GOD BUT ALLAH(swt).. that he will by meaning of course do his best to make us go astray and thats by desires and presenting many things that invite us to leave what ALLAH(swt) gave us and want us to do.<br>  also im gonna ask ppl who hear music to answer: where do u think ppl listen to music most of the time???<br>  no dont tell me, in my house....<br>  i mean look arround u ppl: in the clubs, between a guy and girl in a date(haram) , in the casino(gambling) etc...<br>  so there u find music on and on.....and its full by sins...<br>  and if u'll gonna tell me i listen in my house, i'll tell u its haram ..why? bcz when u listen to music, can u describe ur thoughts? what kind of thoughts u have? nway thats all my opinion....<br>  <br>  but as for islamic causes, im just gonna leave the link:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  btw, even if music is very healthy, yes im exagerating, but lets say music is very good for the health, its enough to know that ALLAH(swt) forbidd us from music to stop listenning to it.<br>  but im gonna say whats very true, that everything that ALLAH(swt) give us and allow for us is really good for us, and everything HE(swt) forbidd us to do is bad for us, like it or not.....bcz remember that we are just human being, we dont see except what we wanna see, we only see good in things and we only see what we wish to see, but we are just human being and we are just creatures so we are weak....but ALLAH(swt) is THE ONLY TO KNOW WHATS HIDDEN FOR US, AND WHAT WE CANT SEE AND WHAT WE DONT KNOW...<br>  <br>  and believe me ALLAH(swt) IS MERCY ON US more than we have mercy on ourselves and more than the mother have mercy on her own baby.<br>  <br>  <br>  i ask ALLAH(swt) to guide us and us all.amiiin .|`|hnEjYV3Iaa	I'm Raw - Lil Wayne
hpenz9hdaa	This isn't the MOST shameful, but it's the most shameful I'm willing to tell you.<br>  <br>  I made a fake facebook profile and added my science teacher. He gave me his phone number and I texted him. Eventually it got kind of out of hand and a little sexual, to the point when I asked what to wear he said "Doesn't matter, it all looks the same on my floor". I would have told him it was me, but he told the fake girl that he knew I (and some friends) had a crush on him, so I decided it would be too awkward. <br>  <br>  It's not embarassing really, just felt like sharing.

If you rent it from the video store, the DVD case will look like some B-Rate movie. Don't let the case throw you off. This movie is awesome. Check out The Descent. You won't reget it.

Ea9A4yHNaa	It is a major major seventh, G is the root. In guitar chord notation, it's Gmaj7. It's neither diminished or dominant. The G dominant would be G-B-D-F. The G diminished would be G-Bb-Db-Fb, although it might be better spelled C#-E-G-Bb.<br>  <br>  Hint- to find the root, spell the chord in thirds. A third is two pitches separated by one pitch name. For example, C and E are a third because they are separated by D. C# and E, C and Eb, Cb and E, etc. are all thirds as well. When you arrange all the given pitches into thirds, the lowest note is the root. Good luck!|`|Zyhe3GvXaa	dominant 7|`|IJBlX0vYaa	It is not a dominant 7 because it has the natural 7 of and f#. It is a major seven chord

p7UcyGYFaa	I was never particularly fond of them, but there are a vast number of Czerny Etudes for all levels of ability. Moskowski also did some that aren't as well known.<br>  <br>  If you're looking more for actual pieces rather than sets of etudes, some things that might be around your level are the Debussy Preludes (Book I), the Brahms Ballades or some of the Intermezzi (Opus 116, 117, 118 all have possibilities), or the Mendelssohn Songs Without Words.

I40vnqNyaa	You should feel really bad...  that's what you should do..  Not only does he have aids but he's taking time out of whats left of his life to try and educate kids just like you. To save someone else from having to go through what he's going through.   After all you dont have to be gay to get AIDS.  It would be nice to think that you might learn something from this experience.   Behaving the way you did shows how immature you really are and that you have lots of growing up to do..   Just remember you never know where you will end up yourself.   One day you might be in need of a little empathy or compassion from others.  hopefully they will show it to you and not be cruel and laugh at you like you did to him.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Seeing you laughing is meaningless, as you could of been laughing at anything. Your school or teacher had the trust in its students that they are mature or grown up enough to handle this issue. What is troubling is the behavior of you and your feriends. Being tolerant of others, their ways and lifestyles, is important. Your actions, joining with your group to add to the myth, by not touching the paper handout is disrespectful and immature. You did not need to do anything. You said you realized that you cannot be infected by touching the person, but acted foolish anyway. Since you asked, yes, you and your friends were all wrong. <br>  Have a nice day!|`|R5I5Znlmaa	I think it's pretty immature to laugh like that. Even though you might feel uncomfortable, 15 year olds should still be able to act mature. I'm 17 and I would never do that. The problem isn't that you "jumped back real fast" it's how you handled it afterward. I would have probably formally apologized to him.|`|EMfLFsXEaa	well the damage is already done. It's not like you'll ever see that guy again, but if you did, you should definitely apologize cuz that's really rude.<br>  <br>  At least you have remorse, that means you have a heart and feel bad for what you did.|`|3N3IXFfhaa	you cant do anything now. unless you go to your schools office and ask them who he was or if he has an email you can reach him at to apologize to him. good luck....|`|pzlxRbIOaa	Ugh, get over it! There is nothing you can do now, unless you want to track him down and formally apologize!|`|MUDLsPpHaa	thats really mean and people can die from having aids.<br>  and if he dies i hope you feel terrible, even more than you do now.<br>  <br>  im 13 and i can tell you are preppy because a nice person wouldnt do that, and you were being really rude.<br>  god people are immature.|`|ZlRBspuKaa	Wow...

It can be a great tool for warming up creativity, or just for emptying out some brainwaves. <br>  <br>  Sorry about your friend :( I like the two main ideas, they could could be really powerful. Maybe like, it took so long to write, fighting yourself to even pick up the pen, when you finally did, the tears fell down like a waterfall of ink, letting the pain speak for itself.

E09RDCt8aa	Try to sing and add instruments......But Lyrics Are Awsome.....|`|car4UyLFaa	I think you could tweak some words here and there so that each stanza has a more cohesive feeling. Like after the last chorus, it goes from numb to violence to cleansing in only a few breaths, which seems too chaotic when you surrendered to apathy in the first verse. *shrug* Unless that's what you're going for.<br>  <br>  I like it, but I don't think it's quite where it could be.|`|xZ2Pli1aaa	I suggest you make a video recording singing your song and playing the song's music.

YQOT68xFaa	I hate the word "tolerate"  or "tolerant" because it is almost always misused. Has anyone read the actual definition of "tolerate"? It means that you put up with something you don't like, don't agree with, etc. Basically it means live and let live. But people think it means that you accept and condone and agree with *everything*. That isn't tolerance! Tolerance doesn't mean that at all. Drives me nuts. And as a result, any time you voice dissent or a differing opinion, you get slapped with "intolerant!!" even though by the word's definition you are a perfectly tolerant person.<br>  <br>  "Bigot" is another word that makes me crazy  Any time you say that you think X or Y is wrong, people call you a bigot. But here is the definition of bigot: "a prejudiced person who is intolerant of any opinions differing from his own; One strongly loyal to one's own social group, and irrationally and prejudicially intolerant or disdainful of others". By that definition, simply expressing disagreement does not a bigot make. But people foolishly assume that it does. <br>  <br>  I wish people would pick up a dictionary before blindly flinging around words that insult someone's character, and make sure it's actually warranted.|`|1854fb53779c38ad23e299fcc95f6010aa	I don't cuss much if at all anymore so you can see where I am going with this .|`|AA10265178	"Literally"<br>  <br>  People over-use it all the time.<br>  It's annoying.<br>  >.>|`|OLcXtWQyaa	'talent' is also used that way, yeah?  like if a person has talent everything is easy for them.|`|mdbe8lbTaa	Whore.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|GO0FqfOIaa	haha.<br>  i don't think i hate a word. :)<br>  but when people are like "dude" every 5 seconds, well um.:)<br>  hehehe

KOGxur8Vaa	As a music student, I see people playing metal on all sorts of setups.. everything from a Fender Strat to a PRS..<br>  <br>  If it's a thin neck and low action you're aiming for (a-la Vai/Satriani), then your weapon of choice would be somewhere along the lines of an Ibanez, or Jackson soloist, even a Les Paul, as Zakk Wylde favours.<br>  <br>  For a heavier action, you could try other Jackson variants, an ESP, a Dean, or even a Strat, like Iron Maiden and Yngwie Malmsteen.<br>  <br>  If you're going to be dive bombing and going crazy with bends and whammy-ness, you're going to want a locking trem.. no questions asked.... and luckily some of the entry level instruments will have this.<br>  <br>  Basically, don't get a floating bridge unless it locks the string at both the neck *and*the bridge, or you're gonna regret it.<br>  <br>  Your best bet? Run round a few shops, and see what's in your range, when you find that guitar that's right for you, you'll know about it. Whether it be a Daisy rock, or a Jem777.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  HFS|`|wDOjkaYUaa	I think for a beginner you shouldn't worry about what guitar is going to make a better "metal" sound because before you gain some experience and knowledge of how to even play, it isn't going to matter if you have a "Carvin," or a "2 Cool 4 School" brand, it is going to sound no bueno. I would buy a guitar that I liked for less than 170 and play around with effects pedals because all the metal you've ever heard involves very "heavy" pedal work. Good luck on your learning the guitar.

tFcsLR7Maa	Your signs sound hot ! <br>  <br>  I'm also a libra risng ( ascendant )  Thats how people see you. Luckily Libra is known to be charming, fair, attractive & undecisive. When put in your ascendant thats awesome because its how people see you so you must be quite the charmer. <br>  <br>  You should try and find your mars if its in aries MARRY ME LOL. j/k. <br>  <br>  Sun in aries - Aries is the first sign of the zodiac therefore aries are natural born leaders, their really head strong. Good for military and leadership. They know how to command and get to the point since their really blunt ( honesty is their policy ) Aries are really straightforward sometimes to blunt for many people. ( i luv it ) <br>  Their still a fire sign. So it does make them a little hot tempered, passionate, warm & extremely arguementive ! <br>  <br>  Moon in leo -  Means the inner you. How you really feel about things and life. Your deepest emotions. <br>  <br>  You're on fire buddy !! LOL. Another fire sign ( leo, aries, sagittarius ) Those are all the fire signs. You have sun in fire and moon in fire thats awesome. <br>  <br>  My boyfriends a moon in a leo so i'll tell you a thing or two about these natives. Their super sensitive ( even though they might not show it ) Their egos might get broken easily. Their playful. Might give off a non-caring attitude to things sometimes. Easily distracted. You might not have a good attention span. Very sexual ! Since you're literally  ( a beast on the inside ) ;).  You don't dwell on conflict or problems to long. You might easily forget about it. You don't hold grudges. I still need to know more like where your mars is at and stuff.<br>  <br>  Venus in aries - Thats the planet of love ! You completely dominate a relationship.  You  might be really arguementive. You want nothing but the truth from your partner even if it pisses you off. YOU DEMAND HONESTY.  You might completely want to dominate your partner. That can lead to many stormy relationships. Aries get violent alot, when this placement is in venus take care of it and always look out for that. You might not want to hit people. But one day your blood might boil to much !! Be careful. Sometimes you're quick in love and in the bed. Have you ever had sex with a woman and felt like telling her to get out after LOL. Sometimes aries are quick with their words and short with the passion in sex. <br>  <br>  Goodluck !|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	1-5 Aries/Leo<br>  The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign produces a personality that blends the Aries drive for success with the warmth, nobility, and balance of Leo. People respond to you naturally because of you are an interesting, active, adventurous, and exciting person. You pursue your ideals with great energy, excitement, a sense of adventure, and boundless enthusiasm. You love people and they respond to you in a very positive way to your magnetic personality. Self-image is all important to you, and you have a natural faith in yourself and probably a total confidence in your abilities. You respect yourself to a high degree and see yourself as a natural born leader. You need to achieve to reinforce this wonderful sense of worth, and to maintain a rightful position of leadership and popularity. Success may come because you can come up with good ideas, but more often it is because those above you and those below you both like you a lot and are willing to listen and follow you. You don't hesitate to tell people that you "need" them, because in your open and honest way, you're confident that they will respond to you and back your cause. You have a warm heart and an affectionate nature, because of a harmonious blending of individuality and personality; thinking and feeling are very much in tune. You have a talent for clear vision or for visualizing your goal or objective, concentrating on these goals and objectives, and attaining them. <br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  # Your life seems to be totally based on affectivity. You loudly and strongly claim happiness for yourself, but on the other hand you're capable of absolute sacrifices for others.<br>  <br>  # This inclination for sacrifice can sometimes take on immoderate proportions — then you only think of living for others. In any case, you find your happiness in giving much to all and winning all hearts. You feel an absolute need to please and be loved.<br>  <br>  # In case of a sentimental drama, you run the risk of collapsing, of sinking into depression, disease, alcoholism, or on the contrary you'll look for oblivion and consolation by devoting all your forces to active charity.

If someone has a humongous nose etc ... , why shouldn't he/she change it, if that's what they want to do?|`|yXB5LOE2aa	Nope. Not for me, but I wouldn't mind getting the bump on my nose smoothed out.|`|GwpMPfBSaa	In certain circumstances I think it is totally okay, for instance if they were born with a birth defect, or were in an accident like a car crash or a fire.  Yet I guess I don't really care if someone goes in for a lil lypo suction or maybe to remove that a bump on their nose, I totally think that people should try to accept themselves as they are, however the media these days seem to make that a more and more difficult task.  I am okay with cosmetic surgery in moderation, but there are those spend way to much on cosmetic surgery.  These days people that look perfectly fine are getting surgery for multiple things and many times they look completely different in the end and in some instances I sometimes think that they may have looked better before the surgery.  Sometimes I think cosmetic surgeries can become sort of an addiction to people.|`|FmqP6JXHaa	i think everyone in the world just needs to mind their own business and let other people do their thing<br>  <br>  more and more people are trying to shove their veiws down the throats of others<br>  <br>  if you have a problem with it, don't do it.  How does it affect you if other people wanna get risky elective surgery?  <br>  <br>  i mean i don't agree with it either, but i would never say it should ONLY be used reconstructively.  that's intruding on other people's rights|`|H6Lc79EOaa	I disagree, on some level.  If it's only for you, to make you feel better, a little ,nose job or tummy tuck after kids is fine.  If you're going for 2-gallon silicone implants, you have more serious issues than self-esteem.|`|8927d354bcc7758ca946e0b5d715c39baa	I agree. <br>  <br>  I watched that show Extreme Makeover and seriously this lady looked much better BEFORE the surgery.|`|lrKdAloiaa	If it ain't broke, don't fix it.|`|URjwNyYraa	Star for you sister|`|nlKZRNqmaa	I think people get obsessed with it and that is sad... <br>  but to each his own I guess|`|XnyFEfI6aa	I don't have a problem with it if it makes someone look better, but for someone who doesn't need it I don't like it.|`|5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	Who cares!  If it makes someone feel better about themselves, then more power to them.  Not my place to judge.

OaCs5bLPaa	I love writing songs and its pretty easy, too. The easiest thing to write about are your feelings. For example, I'm feeling sad. You write that down and the next thing to do is add a melody. Like, I'm feel-ing sa-ad! If you get that, then add another sentence like, I'm feeling mad or something. You also need to decide if its going to be a light and refreshing song or one of those slow, sad songs. Don't forget to keep structure. For example,<br>  <br>  Verse One<br>  x four lines<br>  <br>  Chorus<br>  x four lines<br>  <br>  Verse Two<br>  x four lines<br>  <br>  Chorus<br>  x Repeat<br>  <br>  Verse Three<br>  x four lines<br>  <br>  Chorus <br>  x Repeat<br>  <br>  Or something like that. Note that your lyrics don't need to rhyme, so you could have, I'm feeling sad but thats okay. Pretty much, its like writing only singing to the words. Try singing to anything you say. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps,<br>  <br>  Waverly.|`|8CGvqscGaa	Creating a melody sometimes helps...|`|fIYq1U7Qaa	Well i write songs all the time! here are the "steps" i take. why " " over steps is cuz it just comes naterally to me. but this is kinda what i do:<br>  <br>  we are gonna use a first crush as an example today:<br>  <br>  1) think of an idea (first crush)<br>  <br>  2)think about what you want to say about this crush. you need a verse, a chorus, a verse, a chorus, a bridge, and the chorus<br>  <br>  3) think of a way you are going to sing each part the sam exact way. verses should sound the sameish. the chorus has to be the exact same<br>  <br>  4) think of a beat. add singing to it.<br>  <br>  5) finish it with touch ups with the word<br>  <br>  remember that not all songs ryhme. they do sound nice but its better to have a song that doesnt ryhme and make sence then to have it the other wya around. stay on topic and you'll be good. hope this helps =D|`|ZvWDWvA1aa	-Imagine reading a title somewhere that would make you want to hear the song, If your curious about what the song will be it should be easy & fun to write. -that works for me.<br>  -Write about what you know.<br>  -Think about what makes you love your favorite songs.<br>  -Write stream of concious style about what your feeling at the moment knowing that you'll pick and choose from it later and most of it will be deleted.<br>  -Use someone elses melody knowing you'll change it as the song becomes more "You"<br>  -Dont force anything.<br>  -There are some good sites on google if you type in this same  question.|`|M0IaKtvPaa	well, you must have a strong emotion about something and you really want to say it to others. And naturally the words will come to you, and if you need words to rhyme with what you wrote you can search the internet for a rhyming dictionary. Just let your feelings flow! Hope it helps!|`|eu61O0FPaa	Write a poem then add a beat to it.

Y0w2Pk5kaa	In the words of Tyler “We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don’t concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy’s name on my underwear, Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra, Martha Stewart.” Tyler describes a life style that is defined by things you don’t need. <br>  The narrator “What kind of dinning set defines me as a person? I had it all, a stereo that was very decent, a wardrobe that was getting very respectable. I was close, to being complete.” He is looking for belonging in materialistic things such as his IKEA furniture and shoes.<br>  <br>  The narrator achieves social belonging and relief from his sleepless nights by attending support group meetings for people with blood parasites, tuberculosis and lupus. Instead of suffering from a fatal parasitic disease, the narrator himself is the parasite.<br>  <br>  I have more notes, from an essay I had to write.|`|ee1b84441775c37227d31b7c50729a69aa	Hmm...not sure, but the character played by Edward Norton is controlled by his job in the corporate world in the beginning of the film. As a result, he is the most miserable person on the face of the earth. It is not until he meets the character that Brad Pitt, who is the manifestation of everything Norton is not, plays that he unleashes...his inner beast, if you will, and...breaks free from the oppression of the corporate world. Which is basically the whole idea of Fight Club. <br>  <br>  "Man, I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy **** we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off. "<br>  <br>  Not sure if that helps any...I haven't watched the movie in a while...could use some refreshing.

jgtfWjE4aa	i'm a scorpio and scorps are pretty straight forward and emotional.|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	From what I know, Scorpios never care what people think of them. They do what they want to do. Being in love is not just a feeling, it is a choice. So let him go. We shouldn't wait or force ourselves on Scorpio men. Let them chase us :-) If he truly loves you, it's up to him to come back.|`|rGcEgraAaa	Scorpios have a strong sense of responsibility and self-respect.  Your friend is doing what he thinks is the honorable thing - to stay with this woman and child.  <br>  <br>  But he will never be happy with the other woman and will not be able to be a good husband/father. Eventually he'll figure that out and go back to you.  Scorpios fall in love forever, so he will always love you and will be unhappy if he can't be with you.  But it may take him years to figure it out.|`|7Nnbj1mCaa	haha i think he's bi polar? that's funny<br>  <br>  who cares! why would you want to be w a guy w a kid? especially in your type of situation.

K7H1zrCbaa	i bought two new pairs of shoes today:)|`|6ELSwKKvaa	Well when I work at dollar tree, I try to suggest that if a person has only a few items that maybe they wouldn't like a bag. That saves money and in the long run will be good for the company which will also be good for my job. I am vigilant about making sure that if I see someone stealing or breaking merchandise, that I stop it. I protect the company and I believe that they will protect me.<br>  <br>    I too happen to spend a bit much too. However, I am buying the cheaper products and wondering why the fast food places haven't figured out it is cheaper to package their foods in non brand name boxes and bags. They are established enough that they don't need that area of advertising.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	I pay my bills and mortgage - no matter what.  <br>  <br>  Oh I live in NY so all this damn tax better be doing something right.<br>  <br>  I also make sure my customers "stores" are making the best purchases - I know times are hard for them so I make sure they're buying the right things and not wasting money.  <br>  <br>  They tell me that they appreciate it so I know it matters to them. =)  Love my customers.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Voting Republican again in 2012.|`|yhkEyVXLaa	Making bets with my friends to see how badly it will worsen within the next 7 months....that way they give me their money and i spend a little...on car payments...and more bills back to the companies to keep em rollin.<br>  <br>  ** The people that have the money to spend, only have the money to keep themselves afloat with paying their mortgages, taxes, and any other bills.  In a sense these people are helping out buy keeping those companies and businesses afloat as well.  It is a lot of the retail and food businesses that have lost millions since those are things that people need but will spend less on. So anyone who states that we do need to spend, you are correct, however, we don't have that equal balance between consumer and producer to have it become stable. Sadly, it will become worse before it gets better.|`|29WFvvNPaa	I'm not.  I'm taking the money to go live in honduras where, in a few years, Honduras's economy will be better than americas.  Greed took down the US and I'm not going to be guilty of it.  So while everyone are in the cities dieing and pillaging, ill be in Honduras, on a self sustaining farm with my in-laws that have been doing it since they were born.  See ya.|`|S2tBYhCKaa	I support local industry.<br>  My kayak hull was made and marketed within hour of my residence.<br>  Local food production is on my table; i.e, apples, beers, blueberries, breads, corn, cranberries, dairy, pork, seafood (farmed and wild),<br>  and strawberries.

94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	On the occasions that I answer those "Are my lyrics good?" questions I attempt to answer constructively and with actual pinpointing on what needs work and what I might do to fix it if they were MY lyrics. One difficulty with lyric critiquing, though, is that something that looks completely stupid on paper, i.e. "I speak of the pompitous of love", sounds completely fine in its musical context when being sung. So the final arbiter probably has to be your ears...does it "sing" OK?|`|31e294ce712a597ce759cfa94a5efa6baa	I like to think that I am at least a decent critic. Sometimes I'm even a good one. If I am asked to give feedback on lyrics, I try to help people find ways that they can improve upon what they already have. However, I'm not afraid to call a turd a turd, and if you are presenting something that went horribly wrong somewhere between conception and execution, I will call you out on it. Even then, I'd like to think that I can present constructive feedback about how to improve, or at least ideas about what pitfalls to avoid.<br>  <br>  I assume that you consider yourself a "good" critic? (Note: no sarcasm implied; I was being serious.)|`|0audjuxTaa	nope i never will be either and yes theeere are those type of critics
94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	It's definitely NOT Leann Rimes. I linked a video of her singing it below and it doesn't sound the same,<br>  <br>  My GUESS is it's Shawn Colvin but I can't find a video or other link of her singing "Amazing Grace". I did link a different song of hers so you can compare voices but I *think* it's her.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  If you read it I said *I* couldn't find a link either. But comparing the voices, I believe it's Colvin.

d8h5h8IVaa	I'm a virgo and I hate dumb people and people with no sense of style.<br>  <br>  Also, you have to treat them like they are the only one you want.  Most Virgos are perfectionists and we see the little details everyone else doesn't.  So if you have a loose button we notice, if your hair is messy, we notice, if your socks don't match, we notice.<br>  <br>  We like clean organized spaces too.  Most are very book smart and feel like most people aren't at their level.  Most of the time, this is true.<br>  <br>  We like good wine, good conversation and being with friends.  Joking about culture and talking about heavy subjects- like religion and politics.<br>  <br>  Virgos LOVE people with a good sense of humor too, most never realize how funny Virgos are, because their wit is highly intellectual and not understood by people that aren't funny.  If you ARE funny, you will have a blast going back and forth with a Virgo, they can pick apart anything!<br>  <br>  To get the man be a beautiful, strong, smart, well dressed chica with humor and grace.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Virgo's like intellect.

Each wild card contestant will perform and then the judges will choose the three best to complete the top 12.  So if your fave contestant has already gone home there's still a chance he or she can come back to the competition.|`|1D8Bqtv6aa	9-10 will be able to participate.Then they will perform,the judges pick their favorite three to go on and BAM you have your wild cards.Hope this was easy and simple to understand :]|`|dDas43FZaa	I would say 6-7

ZW24GerXaa	Filming for New Moon is scheduled to begin on March 23, 2009 in Vancouver,to be followed by two weeks of shooting in Volterra, Italy in May and is set to release into theaters November 20th. some new actors in it are Dakota Fanning (Rumored) but the rumors about Taylor Lautner being replaced arent true. he will be reprising his role as Jacob. Bronson Pelletier will also be in the movie. Brenna Lee Roth will also be in the movie as well as Brandon Michael Vayda (though im not positive, its just a rumor. here is where i got some of my info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259571/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259571/</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Moon_(2009_film)#Film_adaptation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Moon_(2...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|iy8C03vaaa	google it..theres tons of info about it|`|lDBI2PoWaa	ok here is all i know:<br>  Filming is suppose to start march 23rd.  Dakota Fanning will more than likely be playing Jane and AnnaLynn McCord will be playing Heidi (Naomi from 90210).  There was also some unknown actor from Canada cast but his role was not released.  Robert will not be doing any music for it (which I'm really bummed about! love his music!!!) and Paramore will be writing the main song.  The movie is coming out in November and since shooting hasn't started there is no trailer.  However there are plenty of fanmade trailers on youtube some quite good!  Summit has also stated that Eclipse will be coming out in June of 2010 so they might be filming simultaneously or just back to back.  They also have bought the rights to Breaking Dawn so it is likely that movie will be made as well.  Check out IMDB for any other current info they post alot about what is going on or you can check out the message board.<br>  <br>  One of the better fanmade trailers:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v1RBkab2DQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v1RBkab2...</a><br>  <br>  Yeah there are only fanmade trailers at this point since filming hasn't actually started.  There won't be any official trailers until filming is done and all of the post production has taken place.  I know most of the filming will be done in Italy and I think I heard somewhere that some will be done in Canada but I could be mistaken.  Also the last poster is incorrect, Taylor Lautner will be back as Jacob Black.  I'm sure you have seen the video of him on ET.  He has put on quite a bit of muscle and was officially brought back for New Moon.  I'm glad, I think he will do great!|`|xUgKkGfPaa	New Moon comes out Nvoember 20 of 2009.

Well apparently they didn't see that there was one of those mop bucket things on wheels behind me and me being the klutz I am ran right into it and fell into the dirty water. And my best guy friend was in my next class who I like and he took a picture and sent it to his sisters who sent it to all the upperclassmen who knew me and they somehow discovered where my locker was so shoved pics into my locker. My pants where soaking wet along with my WHITE shirt.<br>  <br>  He wouldn't stop make fun of my grace after that so I told him I'm more graceful than a skater. And as soon as I said that I turned around and our friend pushed a chair infront of me and i flipped over it.<br>  <br>  (: Priceless.|`|fjlXnf89aa	tripped and fell in front of the whole sr class on prom night as i walked across the dance floor to our table   so sad...  lol|`|kjGMept0aa	Carrying my huge handbag, I was looking at make-up and hair products at a pharmacy.

Maybe you can attend school and find a new career.  Allot of people are out of work, and the government has new programs popping up everyday to assist the unemployed. Check with your local and state employment agencies. Schools will also help you find any government assistance available. <br>  I was listening to this song as I answered your question.<br>  It seems appropriate for the situation, check out the lyrics.<br>  <br>  Good luck man<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCqmJsGpEm4&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCqmJsGpE...</a>|`|akUVg7CEaa	Sorry to read that you are losing your job.  I've been laid off before so I understand.<br>  <br>  But when I need a musical pick me up, I like to listen to Bobby McFerren's "Don't Worry Be Happy."

Look at them both because I laughed pretty hard. Especially on the second one. <br>  <br>  <br>  Dear wife:<br>  <br>  I'm writing you this letter to tell you that I'm leaving you forever. I've been a good man to you for 7 years & I have nothing to show for it. These last 2 weeks have been hell. Your boss called to tell me that you quit your job today & that was the last straw. Last week, you came home & didn't even notice I had a new haircut, had cooked your favorite meal & even wore a brand new pair of silk boxers. You ate in 2 minutes, & went straight to sleep after watching all of your soaps. You don't tell me you love me anymore;Either you're cheating on me or you don't love me anymore; whatever! the case, I'm gone.<br>  <br>  Your EX-Husband<br>  P.S. don't try to find me. Your SISTER & I are moving away to West Virginia together! Have a great life!<br>  <br>  <br>  Dear Ex-Husband<br>  <br>  Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It's true you & I have been married for 7 years, although a good man is a far cry from what you've been. I watch my soaps so much because they drown out your constant whining & griping. Too bad that doesn't work. I DID notice when you got a hair cut last week, but the 1st thing that came to mind was 'You look just like a girl!' Since my mother raised me not to say anything if you can't say something nice, I didn't comment. And when you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY SISTER, because I stopped eating pork 7 years ago. About those new silk boxers: I turned away from you because the $49.99 price tag was still on them, & ; I prayed it was a coincidence that my sister had just borrowed $50 from me that morning. After all of this, I still loved you & felt we could work it out. So when I hit the lotto for 10 million dollars, I quit my job & bought us 2 tickets to Jamaica But when I got home you were gone. Everything happens for a reason, I guess. I hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said that the letter you wrote ensures you won't get a dime from me.<br>  <br>  So take care.<br>  <br>  Signed,<br>  Your Ex-Wife, Rich As Hell & Free!<br>  <br>  P.S. I don't know if I ever told you this, but my sister Carla was born Carl.<br>  <br>  I hope that's not a problem<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f658lK1xTvU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f658lK1xT...</a><br>  (This is just like a minute video.

She doesn't hear him either. "My buns are burning! My buns are burning!" She shrieks, and his father runs over.Billy, uninterested, walks to the bathroom, where a plumber is working on the toilet.

"Leave me alone!" he calls. "Billy, go to the principals office!" she tells him.

"Do you want to be spanked?" he asks back. "49! Hit him hard!" The principal spanks him 49 times, hard. Crying, Billy screams, "My buns are burning, my buns are burning!"The principal is still angry at Billy. "I'm going to call your parents! Where do you live?" "Down the toilet, down the toilet!"

So you still want to tell the joke?" man says" well $hit not if i have to repeat it 3 times!"|`|YlkotyRsaa	:3 <br>  Jokes? Okay -deep breathe- <br>  (prepare for lameness)<br>  A professor at Auburn University is giving a seminar on the supernatural. Getting a feel for his students, he asks “How many of you believein ghosts?” About 80 of his students raise their hands.<br>  <br>  “That’s a good start I suppose. Those of you who believe in ghosts, how many have actually seen a ghost?” About 30 students raise their hands.<br>  <br>  “That’s good. I’m really glad you’re taking this seriously. Ok, has anyone here ever talked to a ghost?” About a dozen students raise their hands.<br>  <br>  “That’s a great response. Has anyone ever touched a ghost?” Two students raise their hands. “That’s fantastic. But let me ask you one last question… have any of you ever made love to a ghost?”<br>  <br>  One student in the back raises his hand. The professor is astonished. He removes his glasses, takes a step back, and says, “Son, in all the years I’ve been giving this lecture, no one has ever actually claimed to have slept with a ghost. Why don’t you come up here and tell us about it.”<br>  <br>  The redneck student replies with a nod and a grin, and begins to make his way up to the podium. The professor says, “Well, tell us what it’s like to have sex with a ghost.”<br>  <br>  The student replies, “Ghost? Oh… I thought you said ‘goats’!”<br>  (Ahh, misinterpretations;]]) <br>  A wife decides to take her husband to a strip club for his birthday. They arrive at the club and the doorman says, “Hey, John! How ya doin’?” His wife is puzzled and asks if he’s been to this club before. “Oh, no,” says John. “He’s on my bowling team.”<br>  <br>  When they are seated, a waitress asks John if he’d like his usual and brings over a Budweiser. His wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and says,”How did she know that you drink Budweiser?” “She’s in the Ladies’ Bowling League, honey. We share lanes with them.”<br>  <br>  A stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around John, and says “Hi Johnny. Want your usual table dance, big boy?” John’s wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club.<br>  <br>  John follows and spots her getting into a cab. Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her. He tries desperately to explain how the stripper must have mistaken him for someone else, but his wife is having none of it. She is screaming at him at the top of her lungs, calling him every name in the book.<br>  <br>  The cabby turns his head and says, “Looks like you picked up a real b*tch tonight, John.”<br>  (This one made me laugh. Maybe I'm just immaturex]]) <br>  -<br>  A man staggers into an emergency room with a concussion, multiple bruises, two black eyes and a five iron wrapped tightly around his throat. Naturally, the doctor asks him what happened.<br>  <br>  “Well, it was like this,” said the man. “I was having a quiet round of golf with my wife, when at a difficult hole, we both sliced our balls into a pasture of cows. We went to look for them, and while I was rooting around, noticed one of the cows had something white at its rear end. I walked over and lifted up the tail, and sure enough, there was a golf ball with my wife’s monogram on it– stuck right in the middle of the cow’s butt.” “That’s when I made my big mistake.” “What did you do?” asks the doctor.<br>  <br>  “Well, I lifted the cow’s tail again and yelled to my wife, “Hey, this looks like yours!” “I don’t remember much after that!”<br>  (I laughed at that one too.. but I'm immature, yet again;]]) <br>  <br>  Hoped they helped~|`|HfscWZRQaa	ok i was at school and eating lunch and this katelyn girl who has a crush on me asks me if i want her buiscut.

In biology, egg is used as a general term in this way.|`|WIXH1OFVaa	The chicken. Because I believe in evolution, so I believe the chicken evolved, and eventually laid an egg. So the chicken came first. :-D|`|0DguhW0Daa	Egg. The chicken didn't have the egg. Another creature did and over time a creature turned into a chicken.

sVDW5mVUaa	Never force anything. Don't do anything out of character, because that's not being true to yourself. This needs to happen naturally... which means you need to feel right approaching someone, and not think about it.<br>  Be comfortable and don't change yourself for anyone else. You're obviously having second thoughts... I'd trust your gut, maybe it's giving you a warning.|`|8WajgMlGaa	If you don't break the ice, nothing will ever happen.

That's awesome.<br>  <br>  I read in another post once: If you are who I think you are, I'm going to come after you like a Spider Monkey! LMFAO!! I'm sorry...<br>  <br>  Anyhow, I'm a Scorpio girl: I would analyze it. If I liked you and I've been in these situations before, I wouldnt come after you. I'd give it another week or two for her to get over you. Or she'll just have fun playing the power struggle game w you. But she will not chase you, unless she feels comfortable w you. Taurus= v stubborn. Scorpio= v wild. You need to approach her first (judging from what you say), if you are serious. Because if you are straight up w her she'll be straight up w you!! there is no way you are going to get a scorpio woman to crawl back to you. i rather scratch out my right eye. she's a straight up person w a lot of pride. so she's going to measure you. when i feel comfortable enough to chase a guy then it's bc i know that there's no games involved. and those are the only ones whoever get close to me. i dont think you will be getting close to her anytime soon from what you say. ive been there done that, guys tip toe around me, and it's just like- you want me to chase you? it shows lack of confidence. if a boy cant approach me, he probably cant handle me and will waste my time.|`|QFJ8FGcLaa	i think you should really approach her, before you regret it<br>  it sounds like she likes you alot, dont waste this chance<br>  regardless of your zodiac sign, APPROACH HER!|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	never get involved with scorpio woman. they are all passionate nut cases and if you dump her she will be pissed, jealous, and come after you like swarm of misquotes. they will want your blood or a good chunk of your a$$. walk away while you can.|`|S6m6ymNvaa	How do you know she's a Scorpio? LOL. No matter. <br>  YOU NEED TO BREAK THE ICE. <br>  Approach her. Court her. Don't be scared.<br>  Scorpio women do bite and scratch. But, stay on her good side.<br>  Because she is MORE stubborn than you are. I should know.<br>  I'm a Taurus as well. My sis-in-law is a Scorpio. Crazy chick.|`|9XR3wqtcaa	Just talk to her! If she really does have an interest in you, she will be more than happy to talk to you. <br>  <br>  She might be intrigued at first because you are ignoring her, but then get pissed off and say screw it, he isn't interested, and move on. We like attention. That's probably how I would react were I in this situation.|`|FJswVeqbaa	ok...so let's see here.i'ma scorpio woman and scorpion women are super mean and very secretive...the fact that you ignored her is a bad move...because scorpios are very mean ,especially women...and now your job at pursuing her will be even harder...she will torture you soooo bad...when Scorpios are ignored ,they will turn on you with things that you will not even imagine...and the first move will have to be done by you...scorpios like to be pursued...trust me|`|a1f4eb464f72fd455618d1ade316680daa	All I can say is I'm a scorpio women, and I get soooooooooo mad when I'm ignored!

xTioPxaVaa	I used to have this trick where I would shoot "fireballs" out of the end of my guitar.  It looked cool, and was actually pretty safe.  The fireball was actually a wad of magician's flash paper that was in a small copper tube that was 3/4" in diameter about 3" long.  One end was sealed, and a hole drilled in it where I could put a model rocket ignitor.  Add a 9V battery and a switch, and it was showtime!<br>  <br>  Magician's call the whole thing a flash gun.  There are versions made that fit in the palm of your hand (this is how they shoot fire from their fingertips).<br>  <br>  That all said, people get very paranoid now whenever there's any mention of pyrotechnics.  Ever since the debacle at the Great White show where 100 people died, it's just not a good idea to be messing around with this kind of thing unless you really know what you're doing.  The flash paper is pretty safe, but getting into gerbs and flame projectors is probably a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|yiZC0UDkaa	<a href="http://answerssee.fotoset.su" rel="nofollow">http://answerssee.fotoset.su</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.

Mr. Ribaldi (Joseph Paur), a mysterious rich man with a disfigured face and an abrasive personality, has just bought and moved into a long-vacant mansion. Bonnie (Ivey Lloyd), an adolescent girl who loves to sing, ends up working for Ribaldi so that her family can stay in their house. But Ribaldi is quite an accomplished musician himself, and he soon is giving Bonnie voice lessons. Meanwhile, local businesses are being shut down by foreclosures, and the townspeople suspect Ribaldi is responsible.<br>  Here are three musical numbers from the movie:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPoS8uIzUEE&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPoS8uIzU...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IehlRLOso3s&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IehlRLOso...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d7QEUh3q2k&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d7QEUh3q...</a><br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  You need to have the date because there are a dozen or more films titled "Rigoletto" but are the opera, not this musical.

HxfLix4xaa	Seriously..There is not one movie that can come to my mind that can match this one. It was an epic, the storyline is simply subline, the ending is vintage Bollywood. It really is the best movie I have ever seen, it has it all, it's an entertainment package you'll never forget. It's simply mindblowing, I'm just bankrupt for words, this movie can not be given justice by describing it by words. You feel part of this movie, it's like a link that no other movie has ever created, it's simple amazing..The movie has it all - The best soundtrack you can get, the best actors, the best director and the best storyline..<br>  <br>  Really, if you haven't watch this movie you must give it a watch. 99% of people who watch this will love it, but 1% will hate it hard, so bear in mind that it might not be for everyone.<br>  <br>  But in my opinion, this was truly the best movie I have EVER watched, the cinemography, the acting, the songs and most importantly the terrific story line, it's fast paced with action always around the corner - Do watch it! <br>  <br>  I don't want to spoil it for you, but if you want to watch it then here's a link - <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.megavideo.com/?v=VBLNQRMU" rel="nofollow">http://www.megavideo.com/?v=VBLNQRMU</a><br>  <br>  and/or <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.supernovatube.com/human.php?viewkey=964227804" rel="nofollow">http://www.supernovatube.com/human.php?v...</a><br>  <br>  *Try the first one, if it doesn't work then go on to the second one*<br>  <br>  Enjoy!!<br>  <br>  JAI HO!!|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Oh it's great.<br>  <br>  It's about 18 year old Jamal, who's playing as a contestant on India's verison "Who Wants to be a Millionaire", & he's already won almost 10 million rupees. Others suspect, b/c doctors & lawyers have reached up to 60 thousand. Jamal grew up in the streets, no education--what can a Slumdog know? So he's suspected of cheating. However, each question he was asked, gives him a clue from his past, to reach for the possible answer. & his whole childhood & life story is just incredible. That's all I can tell you, otherwise I'll spoil it. It's a beautiful film.<br>  <br>  The only reason people choose not to see it, or doesn't like it is b/c it's over-rated or they're just sick of the hype. Well, i say this film DESERVES the hype, & how dare they judge a movie.|`|acVPPTD2aa	I watched and it didn't really appeal to me the way it played out just seemed a bit too unreal. If you were going to watch a movie that has a similar element to Slum dog I would suggest you watch City of God.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	it's very good.  it tells the story of the main characters life as he explains how he knew the answer to each question on India's Who want to be a Millionaire.   It's better than it sounds, lol.|`|xbdrWhcZaa	the movie was amazing. people who didn't like the movie have no taste in what a REAL movie is, they'd probably watch stupid hollywood movies made to entertain rather than a movie with actual substance.<br>  <br>  you should definitely watch it.|`|TaZvxS7Saa	Let's see... poverty show here and there, a lame love story that no one in their right mind would believe, violence, and the hero is successful in winning the $.|`|AA10426129	nope and won't. Its overrated|`|0caec30aea82c790fd7eb31459f6cca9aa	Yes! It was so beautiful. It's no wonder it won for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Not only that, it won every Oscar that it was nominated for! It was directed by Danny Boyle, who also directed "The Beach" and "Trainspotting" and Loveleen Tandan, an Indian director. <br>  <br>  The story is about how Jamal, a slumdog or a person who grew up in the poor slums of Mumbai, India overcomes obstacles. He later gets to be on the Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" in order to win the affections of the girl he loves, Latika. Dev Patel is plays Jamal and beautiful Freida Pinto plays Latika.|`|yaAhsEwxaa	no but i heard its an awesome movie.|`|i0iMZhyZaa	no but it one a ton of Academy awards|`|IXz4j6tWaa	overrated, snooze fest, at least it didn't click with me at all|`|zPaeueYBaa	I have and it was great
d1tlzvnSaa	yes i 100% agree with pikachu does have a high special attack and a low special defense with rash nature i think that would be the best also because if you take r off of rash you get ash lol i never paid any attention to that. but yes ash is rash sometimes and the Pokemon does adopt many of the characteristics but one i think would be kinda cool is if pikachu has a rash nature and when the trainer acts rash at a certain point the pokemon with the rash nature should have his Special attack boosted up 1 level everytime the trainer acts rash i think that's kinda that would be kinda cool and pikachu gets me frustrated at times cause at times even tho my pikachu is a high level it gets beat alot because of the low Special defense sometimes i wounder if i should stick with pikachu or get a different electric type pokemon idk i mean my pikachu is very good but still idk but my charizard that is a high level makes it up with power for pikachu's Special defense|`|Bfce791qaa	TOO MANY WORDS.<br>  <br>  my dugtrio > pikachu|`|TW4MHCybaa	Who cares ITS A STUPID ANIME!!<br>  I love pikuchue though! PIKKAAACHUEEEEEE!!|`|9lVjWPGqaa	i love pikachu!!<br>  <br>  <br>  edwardzslady duh<3|`|Q0M5cQtWaa	Yeah I didn't really get the rash part, but what I think is that everytime Pikachu and Ash go to a new reigon, Pikachu goes back to a level four somehow. So basically I KINDA agree with you. And what's a rash nature? It sounds a little familiar but what is it?|`|jCq07Ik6aa	lick my pikachu|`|a68665ef6c4434c025138a75281114eeaa	Whoa! I've earned 2 points!|`|kA7GEKf7aa	I agree. He's definitely not like other pikachus.

BjPWJ69laa	There are many ways the movie theater employees find out about movie-hopping individuals. On weekends, there are most security guards posted near the rated-R movies. There will also be a certain employee whose job is to just walk to and from each movie to make sure everyone is quiet and that there aren't any people moving from movie to movie.|`|AV0eejfLaa	As long as there isn't anyone at the door where get into the movie you wil be fine|`|Tly9c0WBaa	most of the time they would not catch you.<br>  <br>  IF you are trying to go see   WATCHMEN  this weekend.

Thats the policy for  Opening Weekend movies that are selling out.|`|XGCHYkwFaa	check your ticket, the ushers are paid to watch out for those kind of things but if you get caught you will probably just be asked to leave or return to your movie

Madeline (the girls above me) has a point. It be a good idea to fix those spelling and grammatical mistakes. For instance, changing 'coz' to 'because' or " 'cause." You know, those short cuts to write a word. Maybe dropping the word 'That' on the last line would be better.

Cp6ACouDaa	Survivor man........ atleast he does it alone the other guy takes people with him....|`|W7eEsMjuaa	It seems survivor man is never in any real danger. My impression of him is that he is pretty full of himself. And its also been revealed that its a fake. He stays nights in hotels and isn't really out there roughing it for 7 days like he says. <br>  <br>  I think he comes across as a weenie sometimes. He whines about everything,. where Man vs Wild seems to state facts about a situation. Not try to impress upon you how much he's suffering or how much danger he's in at the moment. Like survivor man does.<br>  <br>  On Man vs Wild. He has had survival training and seems more often to be in actual dangerous situations.<br>  <br>  Now that it was revealed (On the Jay Leno show I think) that survival man stays in hotels,. It makes everything he does seem phony. <br>  <br>  So I would have to go with Man vs.Wild|`|dq7nvrfhaa	I have pondered this question myself.I am as of yet unable to come up with a definitive answer.I have respect for servivorman because he halls all of his gear himself.However i find man vs wild to be much more entertaining.That being said i wish i was half the survivor as ether of them are,i find there knowledge to be fascinating.|`|vGTzWCjraa	Most likely survivorman.

I think it's so stupid.|`|ePYR5RpLaa	I love that series and i totally understand why it is popular; AMAZING characters and it is just a classic love story...with a twist. It will always be my favourite book series...along with "pretty little liars".|`|Le18gqnAaa	Its good but really its not THAT good. not for all the fuss and astleast 3/4 of the fans are just fans coz of the movie or actors. i know HEAPS of ppl hu 'LOVE' twilight but havent read it.|`|LbipT3yIaa	THEY ARE THE BEST BOOKS IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD AND NOTHNG CAN COMPARE TO THEM!!!!

The truth is that the popularity has ruined them because of the supid things "new" fans are doing such as the storming of that one mall in SF, but if you take the books themselves, not the movie or the publicity it is a really good story and people truly fall in love these books.<br>  <br>  I think the movie kind of ruined the books, because the movie was only ok. But hopefully New Moon will kick *** and live up to the books.|`|OlXiJPNbaa	It's good book. Really good book, but the fanatics and team edward stuff it is really annoying!!!! I have no idea why people are so obsessive. But it is a good read. Although i find it funny that I only read it at home because if you read it in public a whole swram of girls will huddle and talk about it. But trust me it is extremly really crappy how everyone obsesses about it. And this is coming frm someone who read it. I am not sure about the movie it kinda left me disappointed. It sucked in other words I wish I never went to see it.|`|Uhbzn9rzaa	I would think of it as uhmm....If I was an vampire fan and goth or something yeah I would want to see it.If I read the book and than saw the movie uhmm...I would have to see if the story is same as the movie.Twilight is a very very GOOD movie thoe|`|YyqWG8zzaa	They are the greatest books ever!

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	Absolutely, 100%.<br>  <br>  But in all fairness, the blame should be put squarely on the shoulders of one Billy Corgan.  His malignant ego forced out two very important original members of the band.  Therefore, when he made his grandiose announcement that SP were reforming, that fact was conveniently neglected.  He used the name of the original act in order to market the fraud.  To me, that's the very definition of selling out.  I feel sorry for the people who got all excited and bought tickets to their recent shows.  That wasn't the real Smashing Pumpkins.<br>  <br>  Corgan made his best music before the shaved head.  It wasn't even close.<br>  <br>  I think all their albums after Mellon Collie are putrid garbage and should best be thrown out.<br>  <br>  Can't say for sure whether Corgan needed the money or not.  Unless he got hooked up with Bernie Madoff, he should still be set for life.  I figure he just wanted to make another last cash grab while he still had the opportunity to suck people in.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	No. Adore and Machina/The Machines of God were made after Billy shaved his head and they're the best albums.<br>  Just because you didn't like Zeitgeist, doesn't mean they sold out.<br>  <br>  A fan made a point in saying that Billy made the album for the fans and not for himself. <br>  Listen to Sunkissed, Stellar (A Zeitgeist b-side), Rose March, 99 Floors and there's heart in them. He wrote them because he felt the songs, not because he thought he had to deliver something specific for the fans.<br>  <br>  It took me two years after the release of Zeitgeist to really like the album. I now think it's great. The best? No, but it has some amazing songs on it.<br>  <br>  I think you just miss your nostalgic 90's Smashing Pumpkins band, as does most of their fans, and people who like the hits.<br>  <br>  And Billy and Jimmy are very, very rich. So, no worries in that department.<br>  <br>  And to correct Lil' Bryan: There were no fill ins. The entire album was recorded by Billy and Jimmy. Jimmy on drums, Billy everything else.|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Zeitgeist isn't a great album, but Corgan admitted that he was making it a singles album and was keeping it really simple. He said that it is hard to just come back after years and create a great album. Plus he didn't have half of the band. It was only him, Jimmy Chamberlain, and two fill-ins. <br>  <br>  Personally, I think if they keep going, their music will eventually get much better.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yeah, I know it was just those two on the album, I meant two fill-ins in concert, I probably should have specified that.

UtbyRpAhaa	3+3=6 plus1 =7 so my guess is 7 is the 7th number of the numerical scale of nonsense the numbers represent lenght width and many more. when 6 is equal to 3+3 it does not make sense so when you square everything adding 1 divided by 2 added with 5 factorial then finding the simplist form of x^2+2x+29000000=0 find the simple form of that then divide it by one multiply the whole thing by 0 then adding 1 making the answer 7. 7 is also my favorite number it is an odd number with only 2 lines a dash at the top and a slash from the end of the top to the bottom of the starting line of where to tell you where to write. 777 is the best number to get at a casino meaning 3 +3 =7 means that there are three 7s in a row in three slot. which also explains why the guy with a mask is hiding behind the shadows looking for his love life. waiting and waiting while she sings infront of everyone with 7! notes and 7 CHORDS in time this will make sense. 7 will always be the number to put your lotto number on. THE BEST molecule or atom out there is carbon which has 7 protons and neutrons. making it easy to share. give off and take electrons. making 7 a magical number. looking at your 7th finger counting from the dominant hand pinky to thumb. the 7th finger. that 7th finger is the pointing finger. it tells others where to go what to get and everything. it also presses the punctuations in the keyboard and others. IT ALSO presses the left mouse button. making it awesome. when you think about it the 7th finger of the third hand and the third body are all connected. and so my theory is 3+3=7 because bruce lee beats chuck norris|`|NUvc8VJMaa	ofcourse , its possible...<br>  <br>  U cn do this with matches....<br>  <br>  Take 6 matches...<br>  <br>  III and III<br>  <br>  put them like this XII (and one stick for UP and one for DOWN , i cant show tht image here , i am sorry........|`|yNNdHDKvaa	3+3+(?)=7<br>  (?)=1|`|GdJTQX6raa	if forced to tell a lie.|`|JfMYO6fXaa	1. lie<br>  2. by adding 1<br>  3. 7-3+3=7<br>  <br>  if any or one of them are right then vote me best :P|`|Wjlg0nLZaa	Dats very much possible coz whoever said its seven is bad in maths|`|wtD1AOwMaa	The same way it's possible that I have 11 fingers.|`|5vsWMs82aa	coz 1 is silent in that like hour so h is silent in that|`|AA11718025	so simple...u neva attended Mathemathetics classes in school...|`|2iJTL7AVaa	Sales tax|`|ylmg0ThIaa	by telling lie|`|2kg2cOHOaa	you have to count another 1|`|dk5Tixguaa	1.  if u make a mistake.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2.

8yE2sYGeaa	The bela lugosi approach to vampires is rather dated.

I don't get why people just won't accept the fact that he was voted into office for his abilities and not his color. Makes me so *issed off too. That's all you read about in here is this, that and the other about Obama and the color of his skin. I say give the man a chance to do what he has to do. Everyone is expecting him to turn this mess around in just the few short months he's been in office. But, they forget that this country has been sliding down hill real fast for the past 8 years. I also wonder if the same thing would happen if there were to be a woman voted into office. Probably so, sorry sad people in this country with such narrow minds. Makes me so mad I could spit nails.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	first off, he is only a sixteenth black, so he isnt legally black. his mother is from arkansas and so is his grandma. his dad is muslim. not black, he is of indian descent. and i find none of this bothersome. all i think is there is to much racism. there is no need to be mean to another race or nationality b/c of skin color or descent.|`|JuzEU8Ryaa	ALL THE WAY WHITE????

Not that it makes the song bad, but it is just saying the same thing too much you should try cutting back on it or try adding more lines in between the chorus if you can try 2 verse instead of one, or if you wanna use it that much move one to the end and have the chorus go twice.<br>  <br>  And not that big a deal but i guess depending on your songs speed the chorus could be most of the song cause you wrote down a lot for it.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Very good country or pop song.

Listen to Stairway to Heaven a few times before the audition.  And most importantly, GET SOME SLEEP!!!!!

A Ferrari might be fancy, but a tree will still stop it.  In other words, it is better to play them slow and accurate then fast and inaccurate.  I know from experience.  Good luck.  :-)|`|64jTtN0jaa	The key is confidence :) Don't think about crashing and burning, think about how much effort you put into practicing and how well you are going to do. Just believe in yourself.<br>  <br>  I get really nervous when I play too. My teacher says I need more confidence when I'm performing ; - ;...|`|w4JAmla3aa	There are a number of ways to approach this and different approaches work for different people.  The key to winning an audition starts with the right mindset.  You have to BELIEVE that you can win this.  That's the primary thing that will help you.  You must know internally that you can pull this off.  It is essentially a given that when under stress, it is common to only be able to perform at about 80% of your capability in a non-stressed environment.  If you walk in there fearing a negative outcome, you will probably have a negative outcome.  If you walk in there expecting positive results, you will be much more likely to get positive results.  <br>  <br>  There are other techniques that can help such as long slow breaths before you play, stretching.  Also, bananas are a natural beta blocker, eat a few if you like bananas.  For most people, socializing with the other nervous candidates will usually increase your level of stress.  Try and avoid contact until afterwards.  Keep your mind focused on what you wish to accomplish, not on what you are afraid will happen.  A positive mindset in envisioning your outcome is your greatest tool.  There are now some books on the subject that are aimed at professional musicians.  Alexander Technique is a method that has worked wonders for many people.  Those of us that have had little success at the other methods have resorted to taking beta blockers and they do work, but I feel that it's important to tackle the mental stuff as well.  Beta blockers will simply suppress your adrenaline and control the physical symptoms. If your mind is not focused, you will still have a problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UlN3vZbOaa	u should strongly believe into ur self buddy...<br>  1st of all u should pray to GOD with all ur feelings and when u'll be going to set ur foot on the stage for audition pray to GOD to give u the strength with whom  u'll going be to select<br>  GOD Bless u

And  System of a down, and Metalica are mainstream on the States. I can't comment on the rest but I'm sure Turisas is also mainstream in Europe.<br>  <br>  "Everyone likes bad music"? Oh my! all hail Ali M, the expert and knowledgeable God of music!<br>  <br>  Who are you to judge music and decide to tell others whether the music they listen to is good or bad? Not all mainstream music sucks, that's your personal opinion.<br>  I really disagree with people who say these things because it's all based on personal taste to which you don't have to agree with but neither condemn those that have different taste as you. Metal isn't the the only music in the world, you can spend your whole life listening to Metal for all I care, but there is a bunch of different music out there in the world for everyone to listen to and have their own opinion about, for every taste and mood your in, for every occasion. Let others listen to what they like, no one is making you listen to the music you don't like.|`|JmzHvt71aa	System of A Down are good but Metallica sold out years ago.

jUVxqqozaa	Learning to play various scales quickly and efficiently really keeps your fingers nimble.<br>  Think of it as a work-out for your fingers: it trains your muscles to be strong and flexible. <br>  <br>  Plus, you'll find in a lot of music from the Classical period (especially Sonatas) uses scales as part of the music. It'll make it easier on you if you already know them. <br>  <br>  Sure you can always try to "wing it" and just reach out for the accidentals but in the long run it's better to just learn the scales. It's techniques like these that will really improve your performance! =)|`|zI3dsfvZaa	1) You get used to where your fingers should be, and the position of your hand on the piano.<br>  <br>  2) You become familiar with the different notes within keys, for example if playing in D Major you would automatically know there's an F# and a C#, from previously playing the scale.<br>  <br>  3) It's good practice, keeps you warmed up etc.|`|IEDVBX4aaa	piano!!!!! hahahahahahahahahaha
9cfe5e64fad9e5fc07aa9a8164bd3c59aa	Good question! (and one many people wonder about too)<br>  <br>  At first the Kazakhstan government was NOT happy with Borat's depiction of their country in the movie - even though his version of the country was obviously a joke and in fact the scenes of "Kazakhstan" were filmed in a Romania village....<br>  <br>  The government even took out a four-page insert in the New York Times entitled "Kazakhstan in the 21st Century" to promote the real lifestyle of their Country (see below link for more details) and that ad probably cost between $300,000 and $400,000.<br>  <br>  But then they discovered tourism - virtually unheard of previously - increased in Kazakhstan as a result of Borat's movie (see link below) and the Government actually invited "Borat" - Sacha Baron Cohen - to visit!  :-)  ..so far, he has declined that offer.<br>  <br>  Also, even though the movie is (apparently) banned in the country, the Borat DVD was a top seller in Kazakstan (based on purchases on Amazon).  <br>  <br>  Plus the conductor of the Kazakh Philharmonic Orchestra was so impressed with the music in the film, he contacted Sacha Cohen's brother Erran - who wrote the score - to write a composition for their Orchestra, which he did. His composition premiered in London first (May 2007) followed by a performance in Kazakhstan itself.<br>  <br>  So initially the Government hated the movie, but later - especially after tourism increased (ie. 13% increase at one vacation spot) - they embraced the film to a certain degree, although I have read that it's been officially banned in the country.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps answer your question!  :-)|`|hQ95u9OLaa	From what I heard they weren't amused.|`|nkfhHJIpaa	they sued him, he paid them a few hundred for all the footage and help and he made millions.

1uSoU8Lpaa	The closest I can give you is I grew up in a city of 100,000 people and not live in a little town of 18,000 and the difference is huge just between those two. Slower pace, less things to do, fewer places to go, less traffic, people know details about you..both have their upsides. If I was in an even smaller town I might fade away completely. But that probably is more a product of having something to do all the time compared to having to cram hard to think of something. I am completely unqualified to compare farm life as I have yet to step onto farmland. <br>  I prefer city life, but country life is nice to visit.|`|lf58nWGEaa	I'd say yes, it is.<br>  When you don't live in a city,<br>  you have to drive forever to get clothes, and electronic-stuff.<br>  You can't just leave the door, and 20 minutes later you're at home, and have what you want.<br>  I lived on the country side, it was so much more beautiful, and quite, but also soo uncomfortable.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Green Acres is the place to be<br>  Farm livin is the life for me<br>  Land spreadin out so far and wide<br>  Keep Manhattan just give me that country side<br>  <br>  New York is where I'd rather stay<br>  I get allergic smelling hay<br>  I do enjoy a penthouse view<br>  Darlin I love ya but just give me Park Avenue<br>  <br>  The chores<br>  the stores<br>  Fresh air<br>  Time Square<br>  <br>  You are my wife<br>  Goodbye city life<br>  Green Acres We Are There|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Yeah i live in a city too.But my uncle has a cottage yeah its totally different.<br>  I too am 15-20mins away from downtown toronto.0_o<br>  Busier.dirty.Homeless peoples.and its a blasty blast (ron-jons really? funner XD)|`|AA11609300	I've lived both lifestyles.<br>  I perfer city life.<br>  They are totally different, but there is so much more to do in the city.  You get to know a lot more people, too.|`|T6WYXtdfaa	The same as country life except we dont marry our kin, don't spit in public, have all of our teeth, and have never driven a tractor.|`|Qs53eDVMaa	big difference|`|zAAeLFLuaa	cars cars CARS!|`|uDozl6TGaa	yes it is<br>  <br>  It very ALIVE<br>  <br>  Traffic is terrible, but allot more events going on !!|`|F26uYw8Yaa	Way different|`|jYmvtUC5aa	.......humanity....in all it's insanity....|`|MwiBGBK1aa	I don't live in the country, I live in a town, about 30-40 minutes away from the down town core of Toronto. It is different.<br>  Just busier, louder and dirtier in the city. But much funner.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Nah, we got cows and chickens running all over the place, too.  I, personally, have the chore to clean the barn every morning.  Just like in the country.|`|ZnMLkSeQaa	yes everything is right around the next corner|`|50UbJp14aa	Totally different|`|spfftUvUaa	Yea its way differnt but I life in a suburban area.

That's why men have (functionless) nipples :)|`|WWnkLkqqaa	You women always say the exact same, moaning about how you went through all the pain, think about us men, we need to listen to your nagging, thats hard enough.
U0KzxpJfaa	My school has cameras everywhere except in classrooms!!!<br>  But I don't think they watch them, cos my friends and I always pretend to do a drug deal or look suspicious in front of them and nothing has ever happened!!! Haha!!!<br>  But if something happens or if something gets stolen they watch them!!!<br>  x :D|`|2IGcH3xnaa	Oh, God no! I can only imagine...<br>  "Oh my God! Is that girl/guy cutting her/himself?!"<br>  "Oh..wow look what these kids type on the internet these days!"<br>  <br>  -- it's not like i type anything i regret, but then people get your info and start contacting you and things get even more complicated..<br>  <br>  school would suck more than it already does.<br>  <br>  I would complain..<br>  x]|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Yes, they are essential for catching people doing things that they shouldn't be..<br>  <br>  As long as they're not in bathrooms and changing rooms..|`|kEtYEmhqaa	brings back to mind teenage locker room movies|`|cR7du1P3aa	There's cameras in my school. The only place there aren't are (I think, because I haven't been in the staff room or Principal room) are the classrooms, cookery room, computer room, labs and toilets. They're everywhere else. I think they're alright, they're there for our well being, kinda, aren't they? To make sure bullies are caught, and stolen property stops being..stolen.|`|0eArONZraa	well in my highschool, we already have cameras because we have over 2000 students and alot of fights are stirred up so thats why and alot of vandalism, i guess its ghetto, well its a berkeley school and we already have some kind of bad reputation...........|`|ktj5qv4faa	i go to a private school, and they've installed cameras which are supposedly viewed constantly during the day, cos we've had a few thefts. <br>  i think it's a good idea if there's a reason, like there's been vandalism or theft. but otherwise, it just invades privacy.|`|TdA6CjVBaa	Oh, there are already cameras all over our school. We need it. There are even cameras on our buses because people are idiots and think they can get away with smoking pot in the back of the bus, and think they can cover up the smell with cologne. I smelled so bad when I got to school.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	How about passing through metal detectors too..  <br>  <br>  I think you pretty well throw away your human rights when you are willing to take a human life.<br>  <br>  Bad enough that people see a crime, don't want to do anything to help punish the person doing it.|`|daij1eBCaa	I think it's a good idea. When I was in high school, I got my purse stolen out of my locker and the camera on the hall that my locker was on wasn't working. Had it been working I would've gotten my things back. ?|`|UZsSWMupaa	no they shouldn't have cameras in a high school but unfortunately for me in my school we have cameras and it sucks a** big time i hate it but i mean we got cameras because of my bad a** class lol|`|yAXrsQiFaa	All my local schools have cameras......|`|RQdFRaANaa	I think its a great idea. Also it can actually reduce costs for schools. I know the local career center high school installed them, reported it to their insurance company and their premiums actually decreased more than the cost of the installation of the cameras.|`|5rraSJRVaa	My school has it in the corridors, but it hasn't deterred any thefts. So they're going to place cameras in the classrooms, everywhere basically. I think it sucks, I know they're not going to watch every single video, but I feel like it's intruding my privacy in a way. Oh well :)|`|vENQ2NJjaa	Well there's no cameras (WHICH I'M AWARE OF) in my highschool.<br>  But now I think about it, I think it's a really good idea.<br>  Especially to catch certain people wagging ("cutting class") which is a real problem at my school.|`|IaZXHePhaa	No teenagers should be able to make there own mistakes. Without people being able to watch them on camera.<br>  <br>  I think that kids will find away to get in and out of trouble even if there are cameras|`|2ba679b56137a99adf21637d7df13376aa	Yes, very important.|`|b6SdIw6Maa	i really dont care<br>  im a junior in high skool and theres camereas all over the campus|`|wa8ISRH8aa	I think its a good idea,for safety sake...>=)|`|9it5nGJjaa	I completely agree. If they had them when I was going, I wouldn't have gotten sent to detention as much.|`|ROWSzTknaa	Just in the girls locker room.|`|Gox4ol8Zaa	In my school there are cameas everyone, expect in some classrooms...<br>  i think its not that bad....|`|mggll8dRaa	Sure, and in many other places;  If people do the right thing, what is the problem....??|`|qpmGLd7laa	Yeah, it's definitely a public place.  I've never seen them in classrooms, but they should be there as well.  That way, no students OR teachers could **** around without getting caught.<br>  <br>  I also think that cameras should be placed in a position to record who enters restrooms, but there shouldn't - for obvious reasons - be cameras in the restrooms...

szyrw5P0aa	no its not|`|0F8hauikaa	Not a true story, per se, but based on life in the south before, during and after the civil war. One of the best movies ever. (I've been told that I'm a descendant of Margaret Mitchell, the author of the book.)|`|waGFlfRUaa	No! The "Gone With The Wind" characters were not based on real people. Several elements of "Gone with the Wind" have parallels to Margaret Mitchell's own life, her experiences may have provided some inspiration for the story in context. Mitchell's understanding of life and hardships during the War Between the States, for example, came from elderly relatives and neighbors passing war stories to her generation.<br>  It is believed that the physical brutality and low regard for women exhibited by Rhett Butler were based on Mitchell's first husband.<br>  <br>  Gone with the Wind - movie - 1939<br>  Gone with the Wind - novel - Margaret Mitchell - 1936<br>  <br>  Official sequels:<br>  Scarlett - novel - Alexandra Ripley - 1991<br>  Rhett Butler's People - novel - Donald mcCaig - 2007|`|QlBLZ4tVaa	It's pure fiction. There are, of course, factual references about the Civil War, but the story is a result of the author's imagination--not fact.|`|771a46b3a001f059eb7ca678c7061fbdaa	No, it is not a true story.  They were all fictional characters.  I am sure that many southern plantation owners experienced similar circumstances but Gone With the Wind was purely fiction.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	No sorry it's totally made up.|`|w3ZrduUfaa	It's not true it's just BASED on a true story. Which means stuff like the war is real and that there was a love story...but they didn't know all the facts and all|`|xp5H6SBKaa	i read this book over the summer. And had to take a test over it in school. And yes it is a true story|`|dRc8zu75aa	No its not a true story, but it is historically accurate.
Q1f5n8mNaa	That song is very catchy and what he is sayin is very true!  Lol|`|cjknXzm9aa	i'll just be honest with you dimples, i didn't like the song. in fact, i'm disappointed with jaime. jaime can actually sing; there is no need for the vocoder. it seems that he too has fallen prey to this type of music. We get force fed this garbage all in the name of profits. At this stage of this man's career, he should be beyond this kind of stuff. it's not good.|`|AA11615109	FYI: This is actually Jamie's 3rd album. His 1st, INFATUATION was slept on in the early 90's. Take a listen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Blame It is a Club Banger! If one did not know, you would think it was T-Pain's song. Jamie does not need to use the vocoder, but I must say, for this song, It fits!!!<br>  Even the video is on fire. ALL of Hollywood BIGWIGS!!!!! Go Jamie!|`|6EzvfrCzaa	That's my song right there now and especially just like me|`|jxdMIAoBaa	I really dont like the song but the beat is cool|`|vcBINj8caa	That joint is hot

It's all super sad.|`|vfywRNbpaa	no one knows yet|`|F33BSs5oaa	It's not known if Kakashi is dead yet for sure. But knowing that he has the Sharingan, I really doubt that he doesn't have some sort of trick up his sleeve. <br>  <br>  As for who "killed" him, it was the God Relm of Pein/Nagato in the Manga, right before Pein leveled the entire Leaf Village.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|FwJP4k8Waa	Kakashi didn't die in Shippuuden.<br>  he die just in the manga.<br>  <br>  and i don't thinks that henata die !!<br>  <br>  will i hope that we are gonna to see henata in the next chapters.|`|7bMYssX7aa	yes he does! it was so sad! he was pain attacks the village and kakashi defends it but he loses and pain kills him... i cried! <br>  <br>  sorry not sure which chapter, but it was pretty recent.

pTERJdzQaa	Good Question dude!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Theoretically she should be able to reject the life of a living thing if she has the ability to reject the death of a living thing.<br>  <br>  We are lucky that Orihime is good and not evil because if she were evil, based on her abilites she has the potential to be virtually unstoppable and indistructable because she can heal herself, and if she can instally kill people.<br>  <br>  I always wondered: why doesnt Orihime just use her powers everytime that a serious fight happens so it can be ended instantly.<br>  <br>  I think it is because Orihime is a Pacifist and she is against violence.|`|ligmlWpgaa	i think the nature of her power is only to heal,so she can only reverse time only for healing.if she can reject that someone had ever lived that would be too easy.i mean if she can do what u said,then why didnt she just reject aizen n the espadas?that would be the end of the manga.that kind of power would be way too convenient,so there should be some limitations.|`|7QuQ4nsaaa	I'm not trying to spam or anything but what are you asking? So far I know that she has the godlike power to reject anything that happened and make it so that it did not happen. So yes if theoretically she rejects that fact that someone dies they may come back to life.

gb8JpBLtaa	As you can see by my avatar, I prefer Tech over any other rapper.  He has a great vocabulary, writes about what he believes in, has some nice beats, when he was working with Southaw(not the Third World(f*ck you green lantern)).  But most of all, he's real and raw and that's why he is great; not to mention his delivery that forces you to listen to what he says.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	Immortal Technique is one guy...<br>  <br>  I like his song Bin Laden feat. Mos Def.|`|WM5gpOUsaa	he cool|`|nZl3aATaaa	Well you see Immortal Technique isnt a "they" its a single guy. The thing is though that Immortal is greatly underground so if you listen to alot of this new school doo doo then thats why you havent heard of him till now. I listen to the guy because he keeps it real, isnt afraid to let his voice be heard and wont be intimidated. He also doesnt sell out, and to me as an oldschool artist myself is the greatest form of respect towards the genre.|`|ErY56G7qaa	he's a good underground rapper that prefers to remain independent. and usually speaks about political issues.. i think revolutionary vol 2 was one of his best albums.. but he has a lot of amazing songs. but you really need to listen to what he says and look up the words he uses for a more profound meaning, such as the Illuminati, and the situations of how we go to war with iraq cuz we claim they have nuclear weapons when we sold them those weapons to go to war with iran...|`|yoVF60ORaa	always glad to hear of someone finding the gold beneath the proverbial surface

cvlQGwVwaa	Well, for starters, this song was originally done by Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails wrote the lyrics.  This song is on their CD The Downward Spiral.<br>  <br>  The original lyrics are:<br>  "I wear this crown of ****<br>  Upon my liar's chair<br>  Full of broken thoughts that<br>  I can not repair."<br>  <br>  This part of the song is making a reference to Jesus' crown, or really, in true NIN spirt, making fun of it.<br>  <br>  The whole song is about how a man can no longer feel anything from his life and what he does day to day and his suffering.|`|QyQ6XoLbaa	The song was originally by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, with slightly different lyrics there...<br>  <br>  In this version, it's a crown of s**t.<br>  <br>  But knowing Johnny Cash's Christian faith, it would be symbolizing the crown of thorns on the head of Jesus, and the chair symbolizing a throne.  Maybe suffering, maybe acknowledging that everything he has done in his life is only temporary, all his achievements are nothing without "everyone I know" who "goes away in the end."|`|UFfJyCQjaa	If I had to say, I would think that it was a short reference to Jesus and how Jesus had "broken thoughts" and "hurt" about what he had to do in the past. Put in present time, a person is high up on a "throne" which could mean fame or fortune, but in truth be really hurt.|`|soJwuVdnaa	This song was origianally performed by Nine Inch Nails. Johnny Cash did not write it. It could be that he didn't mean anything at all by it, and was just being true to the original version of the song.|`|sCooADwmaa	just saying he feels very guilty for all his lies<br>  and he can not fix it

wqchA8B7aa	Journey to the west<br>  <br>  In western countries, the tale is also often known simply as Monkey. This was one title used for a popular, abridged translation by Arthur Waley. The Waley translation has also been published as Adventures of the Monkey God; and Monkey: [A] Folk Novel of China; and The Adventures of Monkey.<br>  <br>  The novel is a fictionalised account of the legends around the Buddhist monk Xuánzàng's pilgrimage to India during the Táng dynasty in order to obtain Buddhist religious texts called sutras. The Bodhisattva Guānyīn, on instruction from the Buddha, gives this task to the monk and his three protectors in the form of disciples — namely Sūn Wùkōng, Zhū Bājiè and Shā Wùjìng — together with a dragon prince who acts as Xuánzàng's horse mount. These four characters have agreed to help Xuánzàng as an atonement for past sins.<br>  <br>  Some scholars propose that the book satirises the effete Chinese government at the time. Journey to the West has a strong background in Chinese folk religion, Chinese mythology and value systems; the pantheon of Taoist immortals and Buddhist bodhisattvas is still reflective of Chinese folk religious beliefs today.<br>  <br>  Part of the novel's enduring popularity comes from the fact that it works on multiple levels: it is an adventure story, a dispenser of spiritual insight, and an extended allegory in which the group of pilgrims journeying toward India stands for the individual journeying toward enlightenment.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_...</a>|`|uctxzjIIaa	Indeed, it is loosely based on Journey to the West.

6RDFADIYaa	If you want to be famous it's always helpful to have your own stuff.  If I were you I'd get some sort of midi program that allows you to easily make some fat beats.  I use Propellerhead Reason 4.0 and Fruity Loops.  It's pretty easy to throw stuff together in either program because they have thousands of preloaded samples.  With some editing practice you'll be able to record and mix professional sounding songs with either program.  If your musically talented at all, it helps to have a keyboard with midi cababilities so that you don't have to rely solely on the preloaded samples and loops.  Even if you can't play piano, it's nice to have a keyboard to be able to trigger samples.  Good luck!
