Mine are 19 which means i should have recieved it on the second and I filed my taxes very early, back in January via direct deposit. Is there a way to track it and see where my money is? Or if I can find out if it was given to any outstanding debt, if I have any that is. Please dont respond your answers with either my last 2 or date I filed because as previously mentioned I am aware of those stipulations. Thanks
20081010072217AAITPBI	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Administrative and Office Support	I AM ALWAYS BEING CRITICIZED BY MY SUPERVISORS IN FRONT OF OTHERS, WHAT TO DO?	I work in an office where my mistakes are often called out in meetings or in front of others.   I am always being singled out even though others are doing worst!  This is done by my direct supervisor and other top supervisors.   There are other women there doing worst mistakes, taking long lunches, making personal phone calls, socializing etc.  But they are never called out about their behavior in front of others.  I feel that because they are more outspoken & loud (or connected to someone), perhaps the supervisors are afraid or more intimidated to tell them anything.  I feel very frustrated constantly being singled out.  It infuriates and angers me that the supervisors try to play the supervisor part with me and no one else.        What should I do?  I have spoken out for myself in the past but it continues.  Should I confront them personally?  Or is this something that I can go the union

My employer is offering 10k if i take voluntary redundancy (i have been there for 2 years). I have a lot of experience and 'should' be able to find a job which would most likely be less well paid (but enough to pay the mortgage, bills etc.) but no it is the time of credit nightmare im not so sure if id find a similar paid job straight away...even a temporary supermarket job??   I dont like my managers at the moment and had wanted to leave previously although the actual job is not bad & the company is great with good progression if i can eventually move internally... is it best to hold tight & put up with my mangers in security or...bite the bullet & go for the 10K with most likely a period of time without work...????

It asks for a degree in finance, economics or accounting, but I have a degree in Retail Merchandising, which included all those courses.  They also want experience in the investment management area, but I'm from the banking area.  It will be a position in a different department, but same company and the people who will interview me will be people who I have worked with before.      Should I go for it anyway?  I'm just afraid that if I apply and don't get it, I might start to feel resentment towards the people who I thought should've hired me.  Sounds selfish, but I believe that's how I would feel when the company didn't want to promote from within.

20090205155925AAtdKpP	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Food Service	Tim Horton's Hiring Question!?	Okay. This is the only Tim Horton's out of four in my area that is hiring. I REALLY want this job, badly! And they seemed interested in hiring me when I handed in my application, two days ago. Well two days ago the assistant manager said she would of called me tomorrow (which was yesterday). So I waited until 7:30pm and called, not trying to sound pushy but was wondering possibly why she hadn't called me, the supervisor at the time said the Manager is the one who does the hiring and he will be in tomorrow, which is now today. So, now its 6:40pm and he's supposed to call me. I'm trying to be very patient but I seriously want this job! It's the only one hiring in my area and is close to my house. But this is the 2nd time I've been told I would be contacted "tomorrow". I don't want to call a 2nd time wondering why I'm not being contacted, but that would probably sound pushy. I may sound impatient right now, but, I wouldn't be impatient if they said "We'll call you soon, or in a week", no, they said "We will call you tomorrow!". Tomorrow has now been two days. I am very eager to start working and become part of the time. I know Tim Horton's is very busy franchise, but is this normal for them to wait to contact you? Like, they are hiring, I think they're desperate for people, so why aren't they replying right away? I would understand if they said "We'll call you soon or in a week" but they said "tomorrow" so I'm kind of getting upset :( What should I do? I don't want to call a seocnd time and sound pushy, I might not get the job :(

20090205155256AA5ndPd	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	My boss has a disability and doesn't perform. Is there something that keeps him from being fired?	Upon coming into my position I was notified that about 4 years ago my boss was moved to my department as the Safety manager because he was in a motorcycle accident and couldn't handle his previous tasks in Production. He has extremely poor communication and speech, takes days to accomplish tasks, cannot stay organized, forgets more than half of the things I tell or ask of him, and continuously gives me his responsibilities to complete. I have not seen any accomplishments from him over the 6 months I've been there. I have brought evidence to HR that he is not performing and the answer I get is "This does not suprise us, but there isn't anything we can do."      Is there really nothing they can do? Is there a law that keeps him from being fired or transferred. He really shouldn't be managing anybody. And I'm getting sick of covering for him. I feel like just because he had some brain damage, they can't keep him there if he's not performing. But maybe the situation is that they just don't care. I feel like I have a right to know why the situation can continue. There are days where I feel like I'm working for someone who is mentally disabled and everyone at work knows that he's not very smart, can't get anything done, and that he has issues. So why is it ok? Does anyone know? Or should I not begin to think that HR just doesn't want to deal with it so they tell me they can't move him? Should I go to Corporate? Any advice would be great!!!

I was thinking about all this stuff I hear about the stimulus checks and how we really screwed the whole plan up.      I was thinking if I got a check I would like to buy something like a purse or some electronic or something, but realized what I really would need to use it on would be groceries and necessities.

Due to providing incomplete information about dependent, I received $2500 less in tax refund last year. Can this be corrected this year?

That's why my refund was lower than what I was supposed to get.

I live in Texas, and couldn't afford the $800 deposit to hook up with TXU, which is the big electric company in my area, so I signed up first with Commerce Energy, When I didn't receive my bill after 1 month I called them and asked them, they say were working on it, we can make you payment arrangements when you get your bill if it's big, call back, well this continued for 9 months, Then I finally get a call from them saying that I owed about $1,600. I asked about the payment arrangement and they said $300 now and the rest on MOnday or you'll get shut off.  So I went to Freedom power, which I don't even want to go over the HORRORS, but anyway now I'm with Ambit energy and It's been about 1 1/2 months since I started new services.  They told me that TXU or Encore, normally read them every month, they supposedly called them and said I'd get a reading within 7 days, This was 2 weeks ago, They say that they are checking on this.  The only thing is I really can't afford a double bill, and does anyone know if there's a reason that this keeps on happening to me I can really use the advice. They told me I would get a bill every month, I just don't want history to repeat itself and get a extreme bill, and I feel like I'm trying to do the right thing, Any advices that I can tell the electric company to get a bill just once a month?

20090205172916AAGjUvo	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Buying a short sale property?	I put an offer on a short sale property on January 1. The house has been on the market since October 2008. I am the 3rd person to put the house under contract. The other 2 gave up because they didn't want to continue waiting.       The listing agent told me yesterday that Countrywide asked for more money because they are claiming that my offer is way off from the appraised value. She says she told the negotiator to take the offer back to her manager and try again. She also said that Countrywide won't tell her what the house appraised at. However, my offer was based on comparable sales in the area and was reasonable. She told me to be prepared for a counter offer from Countrywide.      Today she informed me that this may take another 90 days. Also, she says it is a good sign that they didn't counter offer yet.       What could possibly be going on at this point? I don't mind waiting because I am in a lease and the closer I can get to the end of the lease the better for me. But I am curious as to why this process is taking so long especially since there were 2 other potential buyers before I even came along.

I'm going to be majoring in elementary school education, and I love children. I've never babysat before but that is only because there is simply a lack of people to be babysat! Believe me, I have looked for years. I however, did take a Red Cross babysitting course and everything.    Now, I am finally getting a job at babysitting[which means I can quit my job at shop-rite finally with the worst boss in the world] for a four year old girl named Courtney and an eight year old boy named Matthew.  I will work Monday through Friday from 3:00 pm to 6:30 pm. I have to get Matthew off the bus at quarter to four, and then drive and pick Courtney up from daycare from four thirty to five.   I live in New York, the Hudson valley region, which is about two hours from the city. I don't know what the mother does, but her husband is a state trooper. I don't know if this makes any difference, haha.      NOW! For the question. How much should I get paid an hour? She asked on the phone but I didn't really know so we are going to discuss this when she meets me.       Thanks for all your help!! :]

The lady who did my first interview said I would be called after an hour for the second interview. The woman who was suposed to do the 2nd part of the interview wasn't there yet and I had to wait for their call. It has been 5 hours since and haven't received any.

Opinions please?
20090205174031AAcbQCc	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Would you accept a position where they insisted you stay in for lunch every day?	There is a job I interviewed for that I think is a good prospect and was seriously considering it until they dropped the bomb at the end of the interview and told me that I'd have to stay in every single day for lunch and eat in the office in case they needed me to be around for "something".  They are offering to pay for my lunch every day which is very generous but at the same time, I am the kind of person who works hard, gives 100% and really really enjoys getting out of the office for that hour or so.  I love to meet with friends, browse the stores, go for a stroll, just gather my thoughts and decompress away from the hustle and bustle of the day once in a while.  I really get refreshed and it allows me to come back feeling good about the rest of the day and ready to take on the rest of the challenges ahead.  Plus, if I have errands to run (going to the bank or post office, picking up dry cleaning, going to buy a gift, etc.), it is a great time to have to myself to be able to do that.  If I was offered this position and accepted it, the commute would be very long and the day would be a very long one for me so the hour I'd get to do whatever I needed to would be terrific!  I've never worked for a place where they wanted you in their office for the entire day.  More often than not, I do not use my lunch hour for eating anyway, I'm doing other things.  Eating lunch is not that important to me.  Even just enjoying a little sunlight on a bench is nice.  I think it's important for employees to have that time to themselves.  It's not that they are not giving me the time but it's sort of like I'll be at their beck and call whenever.  So, okay you bought me a burger but are you going to grab me for work or emergencies while I'm in mid-chew?  What do you think about this requirement?  It really just threw me off as I've never encountered it and found it to be quite strange.  Other than that, everything else seemed okay except of course, the salary was not my dream salary but hey, in this economy, who is really getting that?  I am willing to make sacrifices but I love that lunch hour!  Someone....... advice, please!  Is it worth it?

Now I am a hockey player and this other kid I got in to it with is also a hockey player. So he had the puck then I started chopping at his stick in order to get the puck away from him.He claims that I hit him in the legs but I don't think so. He might have tripped over my stick but he didn't fall down. He then took and dropped his stick and started chasing me. I ran like hell but he still got me. He then grabbed my shirt with two hands as if he were going to trip me. I don't know what happen (example: a teacher was looking at him or something) But he then lets go and just says don't do it again or I will beat your %#%. My question is ..if he grabs or chases me do I have a right to punch him back. The reason why I ask this is because . The stupid school we go to always calls the cops every time some one is assaulted or anything like that. And usually the police take both party's in for questioning I have no desire to go to jail so please help me out here. And tell me what I should tell a cop if it goes this far.Such as what bill or law. I did not purposely hit him with my stick. So please do not say it would be battery on my part. I was just playing the game.

It would be ideal for me to just find jobs online that were posted by the employers themselves, but I've noticed that alot of them are posted by job agencies, which state things like, "A well-known financial firm is seeking...." or "Our client, a prestigious firm."  You get the picture.  If I send them my resume and it goes over well, who will I be contacted by? The recruit agency or the employer themselves and where would I go for the interview, the agency or the employer?  Also I heard somewhere that if I end up landing the job, I am obligated to stay at the hiring me company for a certain length of time?  Can someone tell me some info about job agencies- I'm a newbie to this.  If this is true, then aren't I the person who seeked the job for myself, and not the recruitment agency- I mean it's not like they did the search for me and found this place, I had to send them my resume to get things started.

20090203062102AASdKLu	Business & Finance;Taxes;United Kingdom	Savings and claiming Job Seekers UK?	Separated from husband and receiving no monetary support from him (my choice) I downsized to a new home and ended up with ￡6000 in normal savings account and ￡2000 in an ISA..I have no job and wanted to claim Job Seekers and Council Tax benefit. When I went to claim they told me because savings are instantly accessible it would affect my benefits. The savings are for emergency or ill health and/or towards old age. I didn't bother with claiming that time but now after a few months I still don't have a job and have been living off some of the savings. Now if I move the money to a non accessible account to keep it safe for old/age etc how wil this be viewed as they have me on record as having these savings. .I was led to believe u can have a certain amount of savings that wont affect ur claiming job seekers?

I got all 468 refunded to me.      This year, I made 12,000, and my fed witholding is 980, but I went to 3 different online tax software, and they all say I should be getting 680$ refunded...   It has something to do with the 300$ stimulus check. If I put that I received 0$ from the stimulus check, my refund goes back to 980..      So I dont understand, why isnt it showing my fed refund to be 980, was the 300$ check I got last year PART of my 2008 taxes?      I am in the same exact position I was when I did my taxes last year, currently unemployed, single, etc.      Arent I supposed to be getting my full fed withholding back!?!?

I was so excited about finally getting hired after a long search for a job.Then the manager said to me that she would start me out at $ 6.55/hour.WOW! I feel like I have just taken 40 steps back.I am a 24 year old woman with major responsibilities of course.This job is only offering me part time,so the funds I will be making,is not enough at all.I have medical fees to pay as well.I am trying to save to leave North Carolina.    I am supposed to go in at 3pm today for orientation(which I plan on doing).I just feel that at age 24 ..damn I could atleast get 7 bucks a hour,but $6.55/hour.That is what I call working poor.Especially with my experience and educational background.How are you to build and make it from those wages??

I resigned from my previous position to accept a new position largely based on the job description given to me.

I would have never accepted the new job and resigned from my old one if I had been given the courtesy of reading the significantly revised job description.       I was unable to work competently in the new job partly because it wasn't the job I had anticipated based on the first job description I was given. I was subsequently terminated due to lack of performance.       Can I sue this company for any lost wages from termination from taking this job which I never would have taken in the first place and also considering I would have never resigned from my previous company to take this job?

I am dealing with a landlord that is renting the lower half of his home to my girlfriend. All utilities are included and there is no separate meter for water or electricity. In the lease there is no clause to forbid guests, but does state that no more than two people may live in the residence (herself and her 4 year old child).      When she moved in last Nov I had spent some weekends at her house and a night or two on and off during the week (I have my own apartment but I live over 40miles away). At the end of Nov the landlord confronted us and stated that me being there was using more water and electricity and that he was expecting I might stay over once a month. I agreed to give him $100 a month and he said that I could only stay over 3 nights a week (this was not put into writing). My personal feelings that my extra $100 dollars would mean I could stay as much as I wanted as I am still a guest and not a resident there.      He has continued to make a fuss about how many days a week I am there and his wife has made it known that she doesn't like that I stay all weekend. I am wondering if I should even bother to pay him at all as I am quite sure there is probably nothing he can do about me staying the weekends. I have no belongings in the apt nor do I live there. He has my girlfriend so worked up she is scared to turn the heat on in fear that she will get charged if he sees the electric bill spike up.      We need to have a conversation with him and get some things straight but I am not even sure where to start. please help.....

Okay so we found somebody to buy our house and a new house where we put down 2,000 dollars on the house.        Today we found out that there is a high chance my husband's company is going to be bought by another company.. If that happens it means that he will have to reapply for his job.  Hoping that he gets it he might not get the same pay he makes now and will have to take a smaller pay again.      So worried that this will happen and preparing for the worst (me not working and being a stay at home mom) we decided that it will be best staying in our current home because A- we only owe a couple grand left on it that can actually be paid off with the money we've been saving for the new house and still have a little money left over and B- it would be stupid of us to get another house if his job at this moment isn't promised.      That being said whats going to happen .. can we do that still call all things off (we didn't do settlement on the house yet not for another month on both)
