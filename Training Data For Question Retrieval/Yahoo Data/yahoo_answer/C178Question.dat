20090304163014AAtq3kD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How likely am I to be?!?	Pregnant?!   Okay, I was on the injection, but it was due on the 6th and as I had broken up with my fiance I didn't have it done again. Insted last week I went to the doctor and went back on the pill, but she said that I should wait 7 days before having sex. Tonight I got a bit carried away with the lad I am seeing and we had sex but didn't use anything, but I have only took 6 pills as its only been 6 days, not 7 :-s He didn't come in me, how likely am I to be pregnant?! Don't say I am a sl@g or anything please! x x x

20090304164838AAHwfO9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	33 weeks and my baby is breech?	I am 33 weeks but the baby weight 5.11lbs, and is measuring around 36-38weeks, but I know for a fact he is not any future because I had surgery one week before pregnancy! I got an ultrasound yesterday and my lil guy is breech, I am kind of worried because i have been reading stuff online(i know a big no no!) and it says breech babys have a higher chance of disorders and they may not know to turn, but I have never heard that, and the tech said other than being a big baby, he is looking good. anyone heard of this, or heard of a breech baby turning still in late pregnancy? Thanks!
20090304165002AAIsVTw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Irregulary bleeding, could I be pregnant? Please help.?	I posted this same question earlier and I really wanted/needed more feedback on it but I forgot to extend the answer time and I think it ran out.                        Okay I'd really like some answers if anyone can help cuz I'm starting to freak myself out.       The past day I've been bleeding, not very heavily but not really light either.   I really think it's too soon for me to be getting my next period, because my last one started 17 days ago.      So I'm really not sure what's going on.      About a week ago, I had posted another question about the possibility of me being pregnant, so could this bleeding be a sign of that?      (As of right now I'm still unsure of whether or not I may be pregnant...unless this bleeding could be my period? Is it possible for my period to start so soon after the last one? It's never happened to me before.)      I've read that there's spotting/implantation bleeding sometimes as a sign of prenancy but I always read that it's really light.    And I don't know if I would classify my current situation as light.   It's not as heavy as my periods are, but it's more than "spotting."       Another thing to consider is that this past week I've been really sick.   I've had a cough, sore throat, runny nose, my sinuses hurt, dizziness, I mean the works.    I went to the doctor yesterday and I've been on this cough medicine and antibiotics since then that he prescribed to me.   Could the sudden bleeding have anything to do with that...??      I just really don't know what to think.      Please please please help if you can.         *Oh and also I forgot to mention something that is probably important the blood is a darkish brown color rather than the normal red.

20090304180524AAgc0lO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What can I do about my daughter's father?	I was with him for 7 years and the day we came home from the hospital he decided to end the relationship. I live at home with my parents and he comes over mostly every day to see the baby when he gets off work and he leaves in the morning but pretty much he comes and goes whenever he wants to. I miss his hugs and affection at times and it's hard to get over someone you see everyday but i am also really upset and disappointed in him. He is taking care of his responsibility's when it comes to our daughter but he wants nothing to do with me. Should I continue to let him come and go whenever he wants or what can I do so he can still be part of her life. I don't want him to miss out on anything, but than again it pisses me off that he pretty much is doing whatever he wants. Our daughter is 2 moths old.

20090304185647AAZzRqq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Would you name your little girl TOILETTE?	While reading someone's question and answers, the name LATRINA came across. F.Y.I.: that's the word in Portuguese for TOILETTE. In Brazil the French toilette means: restroom, washroom.    In the same way I beg Brazilian mothers NOT to name their boys Allison, I beg english-speaking moms NOT to name their girls Latrina or Latrisha.    Some boys receive the name Allison because their ignorant moms believe it's a boy's name just like Carson, Dalton, Milton, Nelson, or Wilson.   We should all bear in mind that we live in a globalized world, and this reality is very unlikely to change.    Peace 'n' Luv!

20090304194825AAYkBbX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Whats going on in there?	ok, wheres my deal. I had a mirena for 4 years last time i had a period was 10/05. on Jan my husband and i decided to have another baby so i went and had it removed. And bought and ovulation kit on Jan 23 i started to bleed, nothing major..BUT on Jan 27 it came with full force, HEAVY and im sorry if it maybe TMI but i had medium to large clotting. i finally stopped bleeding on the 16th of Feb...YES!! I bled for 25 days STRAIGHT! And during that whole time i still took a test every morning to see if i would ovulate even though i was bleeding (i wasn't). I thought i was done for the month (at least i thought) but on Feb 22 there i go again but this time THANK GOODNESS it lasted 5 days ( like the old days) and since then my husband and i have had unprotected sex. But yesterday morning i took another test and for the first time i started to ovulate...and just to make sure i took 2 more test and they all read "ovulating" as well as this mornings test strip. The only difference is this morning i woke up with light bothersome cramping..now my question is since with my 2 kids i never payed attention to my body the way i am now, does it hurt when you ovulate? And by that i mean the light bothersome cramping. Or would that be a flippin period all over again?      Oh ever since we've been having unprotected sex my husband has been craving tuna with tomatoes,onions,celery and CHEESE DORITOS and i, oatmeal ( AND I DONT EVEN LIKE OATMEAL). but the 2 HPT that i took throughtout my ordeal both came out negative.      plus my breast have been itching like crazy!      whats going on?!?!?!

20090304223213AAlhP5a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	PLEASE ANSWER!!! Should I be concerned?	I am 30 weeks pregnant with my first baby (girl). Here lately she has been way up in my ribcage and chest.   But when I woke up today my stomach seemed unusually low. She has only been kicking in my stomach area, rather than the ribs and chest area. And generally everything just seems lower.   I know that she has been in the head down position for quite sometime now. I had an ultrasound at 26 weeks and she was already down there. My husband also felt tonight and he said he felt what seemed to be her head, which was where my pelvic bone is.   I have been having a ton of Braxton Hicks contractions here lately too. I was thinking that maybe that could have caused her to drop. I dunno though.   I have been in the hospital 3 times now for pre term labor, so naturally this alarms me. I have heard that once baby drops like she seems to have done then its not much longer until she comes.      Can anyone tell me what could be going on or what not? Thank you :)
20090304224249AASbcxT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How to reduce static in my toddlers hair?	I asked this early but didn't get great responses so I am trying again.  Every day I spray her hair with water even though she hates it, and comb it out. I pull the top half of it into a pony tail and leave the bottom, I can't pull all of it because its not long enough yet. She still has a layer of hair that has not come in yet.  By the time we get to daycare her hair is so full of static that it all stands straight up, as if someone rubbed it with a balloon. Is there a product I can put in her hair that is safe for her age and will reduce the static without it looking dirty? I've tried detangling spray, it doesn't work. She is 28 months old.   We are not talking about little bumps in the pony tail, it is hair actually standing straight up

20090304221123AAh8nE9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	What do you think, is bub on the way?	Hi guys, i am 39+5 weeks today. I had a membrane sweep yesterday. slight discoloration to discharge last night. Woke up at 4.30am this morning from pain coming from what felt like the middle of my uterus down the bottom, it came and went and came again so i got up to go to the loo. This time clear discharge but slimy (sorry tmi), went back to bed and pains came again so i started timing. I was having fairly regular contractions approx 7 - 8 min apart lasting between 30 to 40 seconds. These were very manageable, i was just breathing through them and trying to get a little more sleep. I got up at 8.30am and they seemed to stop and then i got one massive shooting pain that really took my breath away. Trips to the loo, still having the same discharge just when i wipe. I called the hospital and spoke to midwife to ask about contractions stopping but she was happy for me to stay home so long as bub was still moving around, (i have also been experiencing lower back pain most of the day).   What do you think, could this be the very start of labour for me? I think bub is just teasing me but the OB seemed to think he will see me some time over the weekend as he seemed to successfully sweep the membranes yesterday.   Still having very slight tightening on and off (nowhere near what it was like this morning tho) and nothing i can time as such.   So... what do you think???   Thanks is advance...

I am 21 now, so it's been a long time.   I try to take my pill around the same time every night, but there are times when 3 hours or so pass and then I take it. I asked my Doctor about this a long time ago and she told me that this would be fine?   Lately I have been having stomach cramps a bit (mostly after I eat). I sort of feel like I might have to vomit, but it is just a very slight feeling and then goes away. I also have been getting very hungry at night?   The thing that has been getting to me the most is sore breasts and nipples. They hurt very badly, and this concerns me because it never happens. My body just feels "in a funk".   I plan on taking a test, I suppose, but a Doctor once told me that if you take it before a missed period it could still come up negative sometimes when you are on the pill? Is this true? I had my period when I was supposed to last month. Should I even be concerned? I don't want to tell my Husband and freak him out until I know really whats going on here, but I'm afriad maybe the test wont tell the truth?

My dad just recently called me to let me know that he is engaged. His fiancee and I already don't get along. They have been seeing eachother for maybe a year? Ever since my father has been with her, I have not seen him. I've tried calling him, and she'd always pick up the phone, and she would NOT let me talk to him! My son hasn't seen his grandfather in months.. it's heartbreaking. He expects me to refer to this girl as my step mother?? She's a year older than I am!      It breaks my heart knowing that my own father is choosing this girl over his own children. They are expecting me to show up at the wedding, but I don't know if I can. I love my father, but why should I go to his wedding when I haven't heard from him in so long? This whole situation is just very upsetting..      What would you do if you were in my shoes?

I had a really hard time "proving", yes, I had to prove that I was pregnant to my sons father. (By going into a super market and having his mother watch, YES WATCH, me take a pregnancy test, because they thought i'd switch it.) It's like they made it harder for me to prove my case.

20090304234655AASMozk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby Shower? To have one or not...?	I am pretty traditional. I think you should only have a baby shower for your first baby; that's the way it was always done in my family. Now here is the dilemma. I had a baby shower for my oldest child, a boy, who will be 14 years old in May (yeah it's been a while). I did not have a shower for my daughter, who is almost 11 years old. Things happened- fast-forward to a new husband. We had a son in 2005, and I declined a baby shower, even though his mother and sisters really wanted to host one for me. I clung to the tradition that I was raised with. Well, I am now 31 weeks pregnant with our baby girl. Again, my MIL and SIL's really want to host a shower. I'm tempted to give in, because they said they have never been able to celebrate a shower for one of my husband's children. I asked around to some of my family (mom, aunt, cousin) and they think it's ok. It's been 14 years, etc....   Am I being silly resisting?

20090304234305AADK1nf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Anyone with child custody knowledge please help?	I met a gal and I really have taken a liking to her as she has me.  She has a 2 1/2 year old son who she has been taking care of since birth.  The dad of the boy was abusive towards her and the cops became involved.  She left him and moved twice, ultimately ending up back in the same state the kid was born in to get away from her ex.  She had a restraining order on the ex but didnt get it renewed and thus hes now threatening to come after the boy.        The issue I have is this:  She never officially obtained custody of the kid, just kept running from this abusive ex.  Now hes threatening to take the boy in court and also to get her in trouble for not staying with him so he can see his son.  If the guy is abusive and all that, does he have grounds to stand on to come after her when she was looking out for the best interest of her and the kid?  What can she do now, even though its 2.5 years after the fact that this guy keeps popping up?  She says she has documentation and all to prove the allegations against him.  Does she still stand a chance to get in trouble if they do go to court and deem him unsuitable?  Any info on this stuff would be greatly appreciated.

What will the social impact be? Was it painful to you? How will people see you differently? I've researched the procedure and the after-care, and it seems simple enough. It's not something I'll rush into. Just so you know, I am a teen. I'm not doing it because of peer pressure, it's because I consider them beautiful. Please don't give me the old "how will you feel about it when you're fifty?" argument. Nose piercings are one of the fastest to close up after healing over- in only a matter of months. This is not on whim, I've considered it for a few years.      Please, your opinions! And tell me your experience!

20090304230029AApa1TP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is it normal to not like to be called hunni/sweetie/etc?	Okay, I'm a 15 yr old female...  & there's this martial art coach (male) I have who keeps calling me hunni/sweetie. I like it when someone calls me hunni/sweetie maybe one time but he calls me either hunni or sweetie after every other word! And I can NOT stand it. He knows my name, I've told him numerous times. I also told him I do not like to be called by hunni/sweetie. He knows my name, yet he calls me by words of endearments. I feel like they are terms that should be used with your husband/wife/bf. And I just feel belittled when people call me it excessively like he does.      What should I do? I've already addressed him with my problem... he still does it. Is it normal not to like words of endearments when it's coming from someone you barely know? Thanks.

I feel like I woke up with the flu yesterday.  So far I've taken two doses of Vicks 44 Custom Care Cough & Cold PM...one dose was before bed last night and one dose was tonight.

My husband and I have been trying but this month I didn't feel like I was pregnant so I didn't do all the precaustionary things I've been doing every other month....like not taking medicine.  But I did to help get rid of this cold and now I'm worried I may have hurt my baby if I am pregnant.  Has anyone else ever taken cold medicine and then found out they were pregnant?

If I had sex with a condom, but it came off inside me sometime during sex, and we didn't know until after he ejaculated, around the 24th last month, could I be pregnant?    I typically get my periods anywhere between the 17th and the 22 of every month.    But I had my period at a weird time, at the beginning of February.       Now, I should be starting my period anytime. But my breasts have been hurting more than normal, and I've been cramping like hell, and have been fatigued like none other.    I know know those are things I experience before my period. I also have a baby, so I am familiar with the pregnancy symptoms. I'm not on birth control, and am seriously fertile.   Blah, blah, blah...   Any takers?      I'll continue checking in for a bit to provide additional details if needed.

I feel woozy/nauseous/ upset stomach etc. on and off through out the day. Im constipated, I pee way more than usual, Pretty much sitting on the toilet may more than I have before. Im very gassy, My nipples are even darker, [[my husband even noticed]], I even had to go to the ER the other morning cause my stomach was hurting too bad. The said it was intestinal flu like symptoms, well I dont believe it cause I have never had the flu and the most I have gotten sick in my life is the usual cough and stuffy nose with some sneezing. and plus these doctors are crap down here and really dont care about people and problems [[its a base hospital]]. BUT I took a home PG. test and it said not prego. [[like a week ago]] AND THE dr. took a pee test and it was neg. [[wk ago]] my friend said if I am pregnant I may have been way to early to tell, and not a high H whatever level. SO what do you think? Pregnant or change in diet?

20090304230311AAKm9eI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Have had 2 unusual periods irregularly for me at the wrong time after sex on ov day may I still be pregnant?	Im ttc 5 years now we had sex on my most fertile day also day of ovulation.  Next scheduled period started 2 days early was very light and had no pain or cramps which is highly unusual for me as my periods are terrible to the point I can't get out of bed and cry in pain for days.  This was nothing like that and was earlier than should be only by two days but still not normal for me.  22 days later I started another period which again is unusual as my cycle is 39 days. Since my first period at 11 years old I have had a 39 day cycle.  The second period was heavier and had light cramps but still nothing like normal.  I've heard of periods during pregnancy but don't know if they are different than a normal period.  I am going to go get a test but I'm disabled and it's hard for me to get out that often and thought I may get a response here to assist at putting my mind at ease before I make it out to the pharmacy.  I could send my husband but he would end up spending $60 on 12 different kinds not knowing what's the right one lol he's not that guy ya know haha.  Anyways I was just wondering if anyone had went through this or had any answers or ideas of why my menstruation could be so different in being a little early less painful and changing in the length from 39 days to 22 days.  Does getting pregnant make changes like that to your menstrual cycle?  Any help or information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you all in advance for anything you can say I'm so hopeful but at the same time keeping my cool for another let down :().

My roommate's best friend came to stay with us from Israel and we ended up totally hitting it off.  We lived together for about 4 months, and he went back to Israel to sell his car and bikes, and to come back.  I found out after he left that I'm pregnant.  I have no fam, no nothing here in L.A.  My mom, sister, nephews, friends and EVERYONE I care about are in Tennessee!  I can't afford to do it in L.A. and don't want to raise a child here. I can't do it without my fam and my mom would be so hurt if I tried!        SO the question is!  My boyfriend/baby's dad, is not fluent in English, by any means.  He could totally make a living in a big city with a large Hebrew speaking community, but you can't find that at my hometown in TN.   What in the world could he do in TN to make a living??  We thought about opening a restaurant.  He speaks broken English and is very shy about it so what on Earth could he possibly do in TN???   I want him to be a part of this, but I can't do it in L.A. with just him.  I made up my mind I'm going back.  He is still in Israel and is planning on coming back to the states soon but where should he go and what should he do??? AHHHHH!

20090304230634AAcXDM3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How do you explain erection to a 7 year old boy?	Since he was 3, my grandson has had an issue regarding erection. When he was 3, he would tell me he "had a funny feeling" and just be crying and so frustrated. Through questioning him when it would happen I eventually was able to figure out when he told me about the funny feeling that it was his erection that was bothering him. When he turned 4, he changed it to saying he was "nervous".I again knew what he was talking about. Since he turned 6 he tells me that "it's happening again!" He says it really bothers him at school and he don't know what to do about it. He gets very frustrated and angry. He cries and begs me to tell him what to do. So far the only help I have been able to give him is an icepack. It does seem to help ease the erecton but I still need to know how to explain it to him and what he can do to help himself.   My friend and I have had many a giggle over this but I really need some suggestions here. Any help would be appreciated.   Thanks!!!

20090305021835AA9pihN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Doctor told me to lose weight.....?	i have a 12 month old girl and am just over 5 months pregnant with a little boy. i am an average size, 10-12 at the moment, a 10 when im not pregnant. I was very sick early on in pregnany, and lost 3kilos. I went back to that doctor two weeks ago, and after he had originally told me i needed to put more weight on, we found that i had put on the 3kg's that i had lost.   He laughed at me and said, "too fat u will be. you're focus needs to be on dieting at the moment"   how would you all react?  i had anorexia before i had my daughter, and didnt recover entirely until halfway through her pregnancy- so i am very touchy about weight. I did so well, and i want to ignore him, but everytime i go to have a snack in between my meals i think of him telling me to diet.   i put on a lot of weight when i was pregnant with my girl, and its nothing like now lol.     So, how much weight should i be putting on? is 3kg's in 5months too much?  just wondering what you all think   thanks!

20090305010317AADfdZj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Can't sleep, feeling so guilty/sad?	Todays been really rough for me on YA as alot of my contacts may know.  It usually doesn't affect me like this but aunt flo is due any day now and I think that may be contributing to feeling this way.  I tried laying down in bed with my soon to be hubby and son.  I just returned to work 3 weeks ago (only 3 nights a week) but I'm still feeling alot of guilt for having to leave the baby.  All I could do was cry when I layed my head next to his little face.  I just don't feel that I've been spending enough time with him lately and it makes me sick.  Then getting slammed today by some trolls on Y!A didn't help.  I swear now I have a complex.  The wedding is creeping up in 2 weeks and that has me stressed with last minute details.  Any other Moms feel this way ever?  I haven't had a night this emotionally charged in a long time and it's tough.  I forgot how tough it is.
20090305003537AALywNp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Moms, have you been accused of being selfish?	I was out with my baby taking her to my grandmother's house and while I was on the bus with my 8 month old daughter, this lady saw me in my Ed Hardy hoodie and she has the nerve to tell me that I can spend more than $100 on a hoodie for myself and I won't do the same for my baby and I was like WTF? I spent money on stuff that's more than $100 for my baby like her crib, stroller, car seat, changing table, high chair, baby swing, etc. I brought the Ed Hardy hoodie even before I found out I was pregnant with her so why is it that her business on what I wear. What I supposed to look homeless or something? Holla @ me!

20090305004652AAsaDg6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is this overboard on grounding a kid?	My friend Matthew recently got caught sneaking out of the house. His dad (who is a total control freak) grounded him for a month. He also took everything out of his room (and I mean everything) except a bare matress, a pillow and a blanket. He took the door to his room off it's hinges, nailed his windows shut from the outside, and removed all the light fixtures in his room. Basicially, his goal was to strip everything away from Matthew so that he had nothing left. No Phone, Ipod, Sterio, car (he had to ride a bus to school until he was ungrounded), or even his clothes. Matthew had to earn all his things back piece by piece (it's been six months and he still dosen't have everything back), even his clothes. Matthew couldn't attend any after school activities, no internet (except for school). Awhile back, his dad had a guy install a tracking device on his car (so that his dad could monitor his whearabouts all the time). Matthew also had an eight oclock curfew. Anyway, is this extreme for just leaving the house at night to go out with some friends?
20090305000716AAcIVCO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Question for teems about parental relationships...?	Are you ever afraid of telling your parents or an adult about a specific problem becuse you are afraid that they might try to dictate the outcome? Let's say that your friend found out she was pregnant and told you about it. You then explained her problem to a parent who decided to take matters into their own hands by telling the girls mom. I think that many teens prefer to talk to other teens about hard problems because of this very reason. Parents will often think that it is in their childs best interest if they handled the situation, and often give their teen no choice in the matter for fear that they can't resolve it properly. Personally I would rather talk to another teen about a hard or embarrassing situation rather than confide in my parents. What is your opinion, and do you agree that teens should talk to other teens for advice on hard questions?

20090305000437AA4Z9A5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Please someone tell me the facts about LISTERIA in pregnancy?	Ok, so Im almost 6 months pregnant and all I know is what I can't eat and that Listeria is killed with cooking. But I can't for the life of me find any answers to these questions.       1. How common is listeria and if you get it when you're pregnant do you know?      2. After you have heated your food to kill any listeria - how long after it cools down does it get contaminated again?      3. Does that mean that you can't have the lettuce and tomato in foccacias in restaurants or burgers?       4. If chicken is cooked, frozen into frozen meals and then reheated really hot is that still ok?       I'm so sick of going vegetarian and stressing over what I eat, there isn't enough clear information about listeria out there for pregnant women. Please help guys!

I am 12 weeks 5 days pregnant but that isnt my major worry as it is the furthest i have been able to carry and i have a really good feeling about this pregnancy even though i feel so sh*t all the time.      I had a really bad motorbike accident last year on the 28th May (my mothers birthday bless her) i spent 2 months in hospital having untold amount of surgery and was told at one point my leg was going to be chopped off, but i struggled through and after spending another 2 months in a wheelchair and told i would never walk again i tought my leg to work properly myself and i am now walking almost perfectly, to look at me you would never know anything was wrong and i am really proud of that as the spanish hospital out here would not help me with physio or anything, but the scaring covers my whole leg and i cannot stand for longer than about 10/15 minutes without needing to sit, also i get so much pain from it that although i have adjusted to it is unbearable.      Anyway sorry to ramble on, but my mum is worried about the effects this  could have on my pregnancy and my midwife out here really doesnt seem interested! I have dreams where i am only about 5/6 months pregnant and am on crutches or back in a wheelchair, and even now i am struggling to get simple things like the house work done what with my leg and feeling so sick...      Do you think i am worrying about nothing? Or do you think it could have some effect on my pregnancy?      Thankyou all      xx

20090305013042AA4FvbW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Opinions about being induced kinda long?	im 34 weeks and my baby has IUGR which means he is very small at 32 weeks he only weighed 3 lbs 1 oz they want to induce so they can make sure he eats right and he gets the proper care, i do not want to be induced baby moves around alot and is fine all but the small part but me and my husband are both small and have small families so i knew i was never going to pop out a 10 pounder as genetics play a role in size too, i have already been given steroids and they will give me more and i dont see how steroids is good for the baby, odds are he will be small and have to stay in the hospital i will not get to bring him home when i come, he is growing hes growing atleast a pound every 3 weeks which would put him at 5 atleast if i went full term, they keep expecting him to catch up but once you are 4 weeks behind your not going to catch up not in 3 weeks anyways and i feel like thats what they expect, inducing also causes the baby stress and makes you more likely to have to have an emergency c section because their oxygen levels and heartbeat tend to drop and the epidural has the same effects and i would have both of those, its up to me whether to get induced and i just dont know what to do i think i might should wait because the baby will come when he gets ready i dont think we should make him come when hes not ready yet what do you think      if there is no weight change i will do it but what if there is weight change and only a pound how much weight gain would u consider okay to wait, at my next ultrasound i will be 35 weeks and they will measure him then and my husband will not give me any input whatsoever and i just think the baby belongs in the womb and doctors arent always right and when they measure the baby it is just a guess
20090305005348AATdaDz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Miscarried a while ago, had a period that ended 3 days ago, just now a small gush of bright blood?	I had a miscarraige back in December (I was 12 weeks). I went to the hospital and the doctor said I could do it naturally (no D&C) so I went home and did. Feb 3 I went back to the hospital for some super heavy bleeding and cramping. I was told I had had an incomplete miscarraige in December that "my body was trying to complete" and told that I could do it naturally again (no D&C still) and went home bleeding heavy with pain pills (I passed a LOT of blood clots, unlike in December).   So I started (what I think was) my period 7 days ago and it was very heavy (no cramping though) and ended three days ago.  Today out of nowhere I had a small gush of watery blood just come out of me onto my underwear (no cramping) and nothing else.  (Not to get too gross but) I sort of put my finger up there to see if there was a lot more to come and there was basically nothing but super watery and a little bit of blood and now its all done (this was about an hour ago).    Should I be worried? Does it mean anything in particular? Do I need to go back to the doctor for an appontment or is it serious enough I should go to the hospital??? I'm really lost at what has been going on with my body recently and I just wish it would go back to normal!    I can't really find any other quaestions like this on here so I hope someone can help!!!

It was red but it was not heavy at all and no painful cramps - more mild period pains.      She went straight to A&E and waited a hour and half to see triage nurse who gave her some paracetamol and told her to wait.      2 hours later she saw the nurse and was told to go home and see if bleeding/pain get worse or not.      She went home distressed and anxious as wanted to know all was ok - bleeding stopped and has had no pains.      This morning she has awoken and again no pain or bleeding but anxious due to knowing a few of her friends - me included - have had a missed miscarriage.      She is going to ring EPU this morning - they don't open till 8.30am and try to get a scan for today.      I will go with her but just wondering what they will do - does she need to take a urine sample or not.      Will they do a ultrasound scan and find explanation for the bleeding?      I just worried about her and she and I been close since we were 2 years old so she like a sister and hate to see her like this :-(      Have any of you gone through similar thing - what was the outcome?

It's one of the first I've ever showed anybody. I'm only 14-      Dear young offspring of a plant I never noticed,      You stand at your mothers base   a little greener   with    lopsided leaves.   She stands   above you,   over you   with a kink in her trunk.   Her branches bloom   outwards, then down   parachuting    over you.   You cling with one last limb, an arm, a hand.   You cling/rest/love with grateful affection, yet   lopsided outwards you lean   seeking something else.   She is beautiful and you know nothing else   but   you seek something else.   So you'll grow   or die.   You'll never get stuck the way you are   or the way she is.   Don't worry,   change comes with time,   and time beats on so long as you let it.   So let her    filter your drops and turn your soil   let her feel your lean and brush with the wind.   Soon you'll change   and    so will she.         Call me if it's not so,   for perhaps you've stopped time   if even   for a moment.      Signed.

Can you tell me what it is?

20090305001854AAXjhK5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Please help me...im scared to death!?	For some reason I cant get it out of my head that I;m not pregnant. I don't know why this is. The last time I had sex was 5 months ago. I am on the pill and I take it around the same time every night give or take a few hours. The thing is I've had my period every month exactly on time and its an actual period.. heavy enough to soak tampons in a few hours, but each month my period has gotten shorter because of the type of pill im using. The reason I started thinking I might be pregnant is because about a month after sex I threw up a couple times for no reason so I freaked out and took a test even though I had had my period and of course it was negative. Since then Ive taken 3 more test (name brand ones) the last at the 4 month mark (all negative) and still for some reason am not convinced. By 4 months the test would be positive if i was right? I know this is all in my head because I haven't gained a pound and by now if I was I would have right? This is on my mind constantly, I've began to think some crazy things like I swear sometimes I feel something there and I'm weighing myself and looking at my stomach in the mirror all the time (told ya crazy)!! Will someone will someone please help me to realize that I'm not already???? I'm about to go crazy over this. I'm thinking about getting another test but would that be silly?? :( Please some advice.

In almost complete shock I said yes. I'm just sort of wondering if it's cause we're both on the same page of wanting a baby or what. I'm looking forward to see what he has planned since he told me he has a "...surprise for me." once everything is greenlighted. He's sleep and I don't want him to know I'm like this. I'm trying to play cool just like he is but it's difficult. Okay,to the real question,what should I expect? (I know you can't tell me really but just some ideas.)

20090305014344AA8Y4kM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	So I REALLY like this guy I see all the time at the gym, but I'm just too shy to say anything to him?	Ok lets get this straight. I'm 16 years old turning 17 in 2 months, and I love going to the gym. I've been going for years, I love being in the best shape as possible. I usually go alone though. There is a new gym that opened about 4 months ago, its like a rec center one that most students go to from high schools. I've been going ever since because its close to my house. Ever since I've gone, there is this boy who I always see there. Ever since the first day, I just couldn't beleive what I saw. I've never seen anyone like him before, its like my whole heart just dissolved and that was the only person I can picture or think about. In the very beginning I remember him looking at me and smiled, an I totally just turned bright red.      In the beginning he was in great shape, but not like huge...probably around 150ish ripped. I'm a very shy person, I've always been like that. I always sort of watch him from a distance, but when he looks I turn to something else. After a month of seeing him, I found out he's shy too..I can tell. I've caught him looking at me too, and when we are using a machine close to eachother, I will see him kind of go do something else away from that area, but at the same time I get sort of stiff too and freeze up. Then another time, which was very awkward; we both ended up doing abs at the same time on the ground area, and we were like RIGHT beside eachother. I felt SO awkward but I wanted to say something so bad but I just couldn't!!      And what I also found, was that I usually always go at around 7pm. Thats when he's there too. A few times I go earliar at like 6pm and leave at 7, and then I see him walk into the gym just when I'm leaving...Then the next day I go at the same time (6) and he will be there at 6 too when he normally goes at 7. I tested him and I went again at 6 just on purpose.      I don't know which high school he goes to, but there are quite a few in our area that are close together. I know he's probably a little younger than me, I can just tell. But also what I'm sort of concerned now is that, he's gotten REAL big in the last month. He is probably like 185-190lbs at the same height(around 5'8) and it seems like he gained like 15 pounds of mass within a month. I also noticed he has a little acne on his back. I'm so worried if he is dabbling with steroids!      What can I do, to overcome this? I want to talk to him...I'm just extremely shy. Is he thinking the same as what I'm thinking?? He's completely gorgeous, and I can tell he's a TOTAL sweetheart just by looking at him.       I really need some help! Even though I've never talked to him, I've never liked a boy this much before...
20090305014940AAjlEvw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	So I REALLY like this guy I see all the time at the gym, but I'm just too shy to say anything to him?	Ok lets get this straight. I'm 16 years old turning 17 in 2 months, and I love going to the gym. I've been going for years, I love being in the best shape as possible. I usually go alone though. There is a new gym that opened about 4 months ago, its like a rec center one that most students go to from high schools. I've been going ever since because its close to my house. Ever since I've gone, there is this boy who I always see there. Ever since the first day, I just couldn't beleive what I saw. I've never seen anyone like him before, its like my whole heart just dissolved and that was the only person I can picture or think about. In the very beginning I remember him looking at me and smiled, an I totally just turned bright red.      In the beginning he was in great shape, but not like huge...probably around 150ish ripped. I'm a very shy person, I've always been like that. I always sort of watch him from a distance, but when he looks I turn to something else. After a month of seeing him, I found out he's shy too..I can tell. I've caught him looking at me too, and when we are using a machine close to eachother, I will see him kind of go do something else away from that area, but at the same time I get sort of stiff too and freeze up. Then another time, which was very awkward; we both ended up doing abs at the same time on the ground area, and we were like RIGHT beside eachother. I felt SO awkward but I wanted to say something so bad but I just couldn't!!      And what I also found, was that I usually always go at around 7pm. Thats when he's there too. A few times I go earliar at like 6pm and leave at 7, and then I see him walk into the gym just when I'm leaving...Then the next day I go at the same time (6) and he will be there at 6 too when he normally goes at 7. I tested him and I went again at 6 just on purpose.      I don't know which high school he goes to, but there are quite a few in our area that are close together. I know he's probably a little younger than me, I can just tell. But also what I'm sort of concerned now is that, he's gotten REAL big in the last month. He is probably like 185-190lbs at the same height(around 5'8) and it seems like he gained like 15 pounds of mass within a month. I also noticed he has a little acne on his back. I'm so worried if he is dabbling with steroids!      What can I do, to overcome this? I want to talk to him...I'm just extremely shy. Is he thinking the same as what I'm thinking??

20090305020154AA3mrNo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How possible is it to get someone pregnant without actually having an orgasm?	I met up with my gf for a nice dinner, we decided to have sex before actually having dinner. I used a condom and had my orgasm. We took of to dinner right after and we returned back to her place after 2 hours or so. In which we started fooling around again, this time I had no more condoms but because of our immaturity we started having sex. We only did it for 30-40 seconds max until we both realized what we were doing was wrong, and we both panicked so we stopped. I did not *** nor was I anywhere near finishing. However the fact of doing the act without a condom scared us.      Is there a possibility of pregnancy? since I had and orgasm 2 hours prior to the unprotected sex which was not finished. This might help too, her last period started on the 5 or 6th of February and her period is every 28-30 days.  This stupid night occurred on the 16th.      Thanks in advance

He has mentioned that he would like a guitar (because I play) but I don't know whether to get him a real guitar so he can learn properly and go to lessons or should we get him a toy guitar? Like...with strings, not an electronic thing? He likes to try and play mine and at pre-school they have recently started learning about instruments.    What do you think I should do?   Do you think we should get him a real acoustic guitar or a toy guitar?   And what other ideas can you give me?      Sorry, I know a lot of questions lol.   Thanks in advance.

But the past 2 days she has coughed for long and so hard that she had thrown up her formula twice. I feel worse for her then I do about my lack of sleep. I read that you can put Vapor rub on their feet. But the article I read mentioned more 2 year old then infants. Has anyone tried this? Should I only do this at bedtime, cause it's the same during naptime also. I gave her tylenol just so she would sleep, but I know it's not helping the cough issue.

Recently I've been having weird chest pains it feels like little one second shooting pains around the center of my chest. It really catches me off gaurd and I don't know if its anxiety related..(I have a severe anxiety disorder) I did however just switch from paxil to zoloft which is a scale one. Paxil was a scale 3.

20090305022410AAiSqJ4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I am 38 weeks pregnant and just lost my pet...I can't stop crying and am wondering if I am hurting the baby?	My sweet cat was only 3 1/2 years old and went into sudden kidney failure this week.  He was nearly dead when he was examined by vet and had to be euthanized.  It was very unexpected and I had no preparation for such a loss. I was closer to this cat than I have ever in my life been to another animal; he and I had a unique bond.  He followed me around all day ( I am a stay at home mom) and even slept with me every single night of his life on my pillow next to my face...he was like a child to me and I am not dealing well at all with him being dead.  I cannot stop crying and I feel sick to my stomach with his loss.  I am 38 weeks pregnant and my baby son is still moving normally and I am monitoring the heart beat at home with a Monitor...I am also drinking plenty of water and eating enough.  I worry the crying is scaring him, and I also worry about the effects the stress might be having on him. Could I possibly shoot into postpartum depression after labor because of this happening so near his birth?  I have an OB appointment tomorrow and plan to address these issues with my doctor, but honestly OB doctors tend to give short and obtuse answers, so I would love some community opinions.

I have exactly a week off when i finish the pack so that i get my period. since taking it i noticed that my periods have become ALOT lighter and less painful that they were before. Anyway last month I took the pack of pills as normal, had the weeks break and now I am halfway through the next pack, about 17 days in so I've got 5 pills left to take, the only thing is i got my period last night! I dont have a clue how because Ive been taking the pill as normal. This period is quite painful aswell which is what they were like before I began taking the pill. I dont know what to do now, do i stop taking the pill and retake it after my period or do I carry on the rest of the pack then have another weeks break? thanks

My period is due tomorrow 6 Feb, however 2 days ago I had some really bad cramping which felt like period cramping. The cramping wasn't constant, it was more intermittent cramping and not that bad, although enough to be uncomfortable and know about it.      My ovulation day was either on 18 or 19 Feb and I had intercourse (unprotected) on 17,18,19, 21 and 24 Feb.        This morning (Thursday) the cramping is gone and I haven't felt any cramping since then.      Could this cramping I experienced be implantation cramping or could it just have been my body letting me know that my period is on it's way.       I have to also mention that I've never had period cramping before actually starting my period.  My cramping usually starts when my period starts.

I was supposed to be 11weeks pregnant this week but i miscarried our child at 8 weeks 1 day. I found out on on tuesday, i went to the hospital with the impression that they would help me, instead they decided i was a patient that didn't need any form of urgent looking after, this was on wednesday, they ended up stuffing me around that much that i had to go home and go back today, when i was meant to be booked in for the surgery this morning, well my body had taken it's own cause of action by the time i got there. They have now scared me emotionally for life by stuffing me around that much that i ended up passing my child while i was getting changed. I then lost allot of blood and was told that i was to be put in bed and not move as i can;t loose to much more blood, they then didn't talk to me for 3 hours when the surgeon came down to talk to me he told me to go home as my body was taking the natural course. Now i am at home with a one year old boy that i can't look after, i am not living with my partner and he has to go away tomorrow for a few days for work.

20090305031518AAO6rgS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Canceling bar mitzvah celebration as punishment for wetting the bed?	My son will be 13 in a few months and he still wets the bed almost every night. According to halacha, he'll still become an adult whether there is a ceremony in shul or not. But he certainly isn't a "man" if he still wears diapers to bed. I'm sure you can imagine how I feel having to buy him "goodnites" at the supermarket. I fill up the cart with other things, then go to the diaper aisle, look around to make sure no one can see, then I put the goodnites in the cart under other things. Is taking away his bar mitzvah an acceptable punishment? Of couse, he can have the party as soon as he starts waking up dry.
