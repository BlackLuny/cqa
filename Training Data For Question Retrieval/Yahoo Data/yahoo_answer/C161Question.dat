So, when did you start? Did you wait until your baby turned a year old or did you introduce small amounts earlier than that? Also, how did you wean?

20090222220949AAxucIy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How long can you ground a child or teen for?	I can see a week or two.  But like 2 months?        Also I think restricting TV for a long period is cruel.  I was an only child and sometimes TV keeps you company.        Long grounding can lead to depression and social problem in kids.  Adults can sit for hours and just think about life, but children need interaction.      I read one question on here about a 17 year old teenager getting grounded 4 months, for being 4 hours over his curfew.  4 months of sitting in his room, losing everything.  That will only lead to resentment.        I saw another question where a 15 year old got 6 months of grounding!  Basically he will have no summer vacation.        How can you ground a kid over their summer vacation?  That's the only time of freedom in their school years.           I literally cried when I saw that question.

20090222222743AAAOlF9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Once you're 18, are you REALLY free from your parents?	I'm almost 15, counting the days til I'm 18.      I really don't want them in my life after I turn 18. If I ever decide to have kids, can they have visitation rights? I don't want them to. My dad is an alcoholic (getting better, but i still can't trust him), and my mom is insane. I live in California.      I don't agree with my mother's very religious side of the family. My dad doesn't care so much about it, as long as I'm happy.      My mom only want me dating white men, and after I move out, I really don't want her involved in my relationships. She'd lecture me forever as she already does about, "YOU MUST HAVE PURE WHITE CHILDREN."      I'm scared that even after I'm 18, I'll never hear the end of it from her. I don't even like guys much if not at all, and she wont accept the fact I'm not straight. (Still a bit confused)      My dad is planning on providing housing for me in San Diego so I don't have to live on campus or anything. Dorm life is not for me. But I'm worried he also may be up in my business involving relationships, friends, choices, jobs and such, and that bothers me.       I worry my mother will still be calling me every single day, and will boss me around as if I'm still living under her roof.      Are kids really free from their parents when they turn 18? Or will the badgering never end without a court order or something?

20090222223022AAXGwrX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is it normal to not plan for marriage?	I remembered I was in a heated discussion for should you wait till marriage to have sex. I said I was against because I personally don't plan to get married anyways. Now if it happened, it would happen. But I felt like planning for marriage is kinda dumb and I'm more concerned with being independent then waiting for a husband. That's when this girl said that she felt sorry for me because I said I didn't plan for it which meant that I probably felt like I couldn't get a husband. I just think that it's something I shouldn't plan for because it's stupid to plan love.      Am I missing something or is it not normal to say you don't think about marriage?

When I asked her if they were playing or wrestling, she said no and that he got mad because she was "copying" the things he was saying. My question is, what should I do about this? Does this warrant a call/visit to the police or CPS or should I talk to her father? She is 9 and usually doesnt want to go to his house and maybe this is why.

20090222223840AApXyA6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Has this happened to you?....3 to 4 days late for period, then light scanty bleeding?	Has this happened to anyone else? I was 4 days late this month( due on the  Feb 17th, but didn't have any signs of a period until the 20th).      I am always 31 days for my cycle and always have cramps and fairly heavy bleeding. Hubby and I had unprotected sex 3 times in the last month. I am not more stressed than normal and haven't changed my diet. I do have Hyperthyroidism, but it has never effected my periods before( I have had it for 2 years).      On day 34 from last cycle or Feb. 20th day I had scanty brown discharge throughout the day, and no cramps. On the 21st I had the brown discharge with some fresh blood and dull cramping throughout the day. Some times there was nothing when I wiped and twice there was about half a teaspoons worth of new and old blood mixed. Today the 22nd there was back to the same amount of scanty brown blood as the first day and NO cramping. I have taken a couple of HPT test all saying Negative. I got a blood test on the 20th but the doctors haven't called me back(but I think it was too early to test anyway).       Has this ever happened to anyone else and they ended up pregnant?      I am so impatient to find out what is happening. I will be frustrated if I find out its a medical issue rather than pregnancy, but I am also aware that ovarian cyst and thyroid problems can cause this type of stuff.       I hope everything is ok. I would be very excited if I was pregnant!

20090222223555AAxrZFg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	So what does everyone else think of this?	Hi all,      Well my daughter is 5 years old.  She was diagnosed with Williams Syndrome at age 2. It's been a rough road here and there for us but we are learning to take one day at a time with her.      Recently back in January she started school. We are hoping to have her at mainstream school full time but took the advice of the special school she attended for kindy to go 3 days mainstream and 2 days special school.  This worked great for 2 weeks.  By week 3 however, all was not rosy!  She really went off the rails and started to play up big time at mainstream to the point where she threatened to run away after the teacher already caught her once.  It was so upsetting for us that week.  After consulting with the special school again, we have dropped her hours back to just 2 hours mainstream school with one on one aid support every Monday and 4 days at Special School with the end result of hopefully increasing her time gradually at mainstream over the year and easing her into it.  This last 2 weeks though, she has been great.  We as her parents have also decided to treat her as though she has ADHD/ADD as WS people are prone to it so we decided to change her diet after getting comments back from mainstream that she was a totally different child after having some rice crisps that had a particular "natural" colour on them.  We have since seen a dietitian who has also suggested we put her on an "elimination diet" which we will be starting next Monday. In the meantime though we have cut out all artificial preservatives, colours and flavours and already we have seen a huge difference in her.        I guess my question to all would be, with so many children these days being diagnosed with ADHD and ADD and other various behavioural disorders, would you be willing to change your child's diet in order to avoid medications or would you just put your child on medications and hope for the best, forgetting that putting a child on meds doesn't mean it will fix them as it could very well be the food we feed them that set them off and the meds and diet end up fighting inside your child's body!  After reading so much information and talking to this dietitian, it is frightening to realize how much "they" add and process our foods that are actually suppose to be "natural".  I know what we would do, and we are doing it. We want our daughter to be able to attend mainstream full time because she is not special school material, it has yet to be confirmed with an IQ test later this year, but we have been told she is only mildly affected with WS.  We strongly feel that amending her diet will help with her already short attention span and behaviour but those who know a WS child or person, know that they are beautiful human beings that are so loving and affectionate, that's what we want to shine through, not the behaviour.  So what does everyone else think, diet change or meds?!      No rude comments please and any personal experiences in this area, I would love to hear.  Thanx and sorry it's a long one and I have put it here in Pregnancy and parenting as this is where I am most of the time. Thanx
20090222224325AAWj9t2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Anyone else sad because of how fast your baby is growing?	It's so bittersweet. I am so thankful that he is a growing, thriving boy, yet I have found myself lately really sad about him growing so fast. When he was a newborn, I suffered very bad baby blues. So instead of enjoying my precious little baby, I was all caught up in the emotions of missing being pregnant with him, and other things that kept me crying and kept my thoughts occupied. I feel like I let those priceless moments slip by because I was too busy feeling sorry for myself because I had a c-section and didn't get the natural birth I so badly wanted. Now that I look back at pictures and videos of when he was a newborn, I cry. I know that crying will get me no where because I can never get those moments back, I just wish I could get past these feelings of guilt. I am so absolutely crazy about my son. He is only about to be six months which is still fairly little, and I enjoy every single moment with him, I just keep beating myself up about the first six to eight weeks I let slip by. Looking back now, if I could have realized how fast those moments were going to go by, I would have never took my eyes off my son. Please give me some advice moms. I want to have another baby soon, so this has definitely been a learning experience. I will know next time not to let the precious moments slip by.

Don't say you don't like it because it's popular or anything like that. I mean don't you like the sound etc.? And isn't Nick an adorable nick name?      What do you think of the name?      Anyone there who truly doesn't like it? If so why?

There names are Kasten & Larity. And I have know then so long that I told them when I have my first and/or second female kid I would like to name her after them.      With the names Kasten & Larity.   Are these names common are rare in America?   And can you see any problems the kid mite face with these names?

20090222232226AAjDxdn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How much Allowance is reasonable for a 14 year-old?	This is kinda long, but please read it all anyway :)      I'm 14 and don't get any Allowance. I do jobs around the house although they aren't scheduled/regular.      If my Mum organises some frequent jobs to do aroun d the house, how much money is acceptable per week?      I'm thinking something like:      Week 1:   Feed cats [2x a day, plus dry food and changing water]   Put away dishes [once a day]   Tidy bathroom [Thorough clean once a week, tidy-up every day or two]      Week 2:   Clean both Toilets [Every second day]   Sweep out the front [which includes the porch, stairs and the front path]   Sweep the stairs [indoors]      Week 3:   Vacuum upstairs Hallway + Stairs   Tidy Upstairs Bathroom [Again, clean once a wek and tidy-up every day or two]   Sweep tiled area [Kitchen, Entrance and Dining room]      I have two sisters [nearly 16 and nearly 17] so the sets of jobs will rotate weekly. How much should they be getting paid? Keep in mind that the 15 year-old works at her own job and the 16 year-old gets Youth Allowance from the government. On average they both get around $80 - $100 a week, but a large majority of this goes to things like phone bills, driving lessons/dance lessons. I don't have any job at all and cannot get Youth Allowance until i'm 16. The one with a job can apply for Youth Allowance within a month [when she turns 16] so she can work AND get Youth Allowance because it's cash-in-hand pay @ her work.      P.S. On top of the scheduled jobs, we will also be doing our own washing weekly [including hanging on the line and taking inside] and cleaning our rooms.      Thankyou :)

20090222235631AAOJyBs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why  would a parent not spank?	ok so people have asked bout spanking and honestly I think it is a wonderful tool in raising r children.... ABUSE and I do mean true abuse should not happen... but no spanking? come on people lets be real... no one is going to learn anything from u letting it slide all the time, just talking about it, etc. etc.   It's so sick that parents refuse to spank now... and those kids that don't get it rule the house, they turn into snobs, they do whatever the **** they want, and that is ok?   GIVE ME A BREAK and if u want to see what my parents did look at my previous answer about spanking... i'm glad my parents did... kids now adays turn into snobs and not spanking when necessary is like neglecting ur child....    ALSO VERBAL ABUSE I SEE MORE AND MORE THAN SPANKING, HOW IS THAT BETTER?   WHAT DO U THINK AMERICA?

20090222225340AA2xSno	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am I being unfair to my husband? (sorry it's a bit long)?	I am 36 weeks pregnant and my husband is in a job which takes him away from home a lot. However when he is at home he always wants to socialise with his best friend and his girlfriend (both of whom I get on with but would not call close friends of mine).      For example in the past 5 days we have spent 4 days with these people and 3 of these days my husband and his friend have gotten so drunk that they could barely stand. I know my husband is freaking a bit about the birth coming up and has said he wants to cram all he can into life while he can but I feel that he is being exceptionally irresponible.      I am really worried that I will go into labor early and y husband will either be too busy with his friend or too drunk to take me to the hospital. When I try tell him about my fears he tells me that I am being ridiculus and he will always be there for me but I struggle to believe him.      Please know that this is not my husband's normal behaviour. He is usually very caring and attentive and this change has only come up in the past 2 months. I have reached a point though where I want to tell him that if he cannot show me that he will actually be there then I want to go and stay with my parents until the birth where there will be someone to be there for me when I go into labor.       Is this unfair and should I just let him get this out of his system and hope that he will be ok when I finally do go into labor?      Thanks in advance.

20090222224853AAGzRiA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Girlfriend punished her son for shoplifting.  Did she go too far?	My girlfriend's 13 year old son was caught shoplifting some girlie magazines from a card store.  The cops were called, but the owner didn't press charges.  I drove her there to pick up her son.      When we got to her house she yelled at her son, he cried, and she grounded him for 4 months, until June when school ends.  I thought he would just not be allowed out of the house.  But his mother said "No TV, computer, video games, phone.  You stay in your room!"      I didn't say anything to her, because he is her son, not my child.  But I think this punishment is too harsh.  I feel so bad for the kid.        This Friday her and I picked him up from school, and he was real quiet in the car.  When we got to her house, she told her son "All right, now go to your room"  He got weepy and went to his room.  Probably to cry.  Later we had dinner like at 5, and then she says "All right, now go to your room, bedtime at 7"   7 PM?  Whatever...      I'm not sure I can date this woman anymore, I couldn't sleep at all last night thinking about it.

Neither sides of our family now we are not Christians.My thing is.would it be wrong of us not to have our child take first Communion as part of a family tradition?

20090222224352AA4sVTu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My 17 year old fiance wants a child. I am 21. I want us to think it through. What should I do?	I am 21 and she is 17. We have been together since October 16th, 2008. I have already told her I wanna spend the rest of my life with her. However lately she has been talking about a child. I am not ready and I like to think ahead. I think ahead before doing something serious. She said I make all the big decisions and I wont give her the one thing that she wants. We argue over this all the time and I still wont change my mind. All of these arguments make me think we wont get along when we are married which makes me think twice about going through with a proposal. She said many parents struggle and make it and that we could do it. Shes working at a fast food place and I am working only 2-5 hours a week for Autozone. I am on the lookout for another job. My family has turned my power and water off because Autozone isnt giving me enough money to pay my bills. I think I should be able to pay bills before thinking of a child. I was supposed to go look for an apartment but she wants to go. I was just going for something affordable that I might can afford when I get a better job. She and I talked about living together but she got scared the first time and now were talking about it again. Should we get together and live together for a while before attempting something so big. I love this girl like no other but I don't think this is healthy for our relationship. I keep thinking that if she is not able to agree with me and think ahead and if shes not happy with my decision to be smart and wait until we can both afford and handle the situation that maybe she should find someone that will give her what she wants. It hurts to say that but thats what I sometimes get to thinking. I hate that we argue and I dont wanna lose her but if shes not happy with me over that, then why cant she find someone that will make her happy.

20090222225133AAE7sHC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My BF of a year has a baby! Not sure how to take it. Help?	He was dating this girl for a few months right before him & I got together. She had gotten pregnant and said it was his. From her behavior he didn't really believe her. I have been trying to prepare myself since he told me a few months after we'd been together. (me not thinking about it truly and communicated with him first) said I will love you and be with you no matter what.      Well as it got closer and closer to her having the baby I began to freak. I never saw it as reality before and It hit me. At that point I definitely was head over hills for my BF and I still am. I don't want to give him up...I love him dearly. If this child is his I will love her as well. I just want to find a way to cope.    First to help answer my question, let me state why it gets to me.      1st I always wanted to have a family, that was just from my husband & I.    2nd: when I think of him having a child with another woman, It rubs me wrong because I know what makes babies and imagining him with another woman!!! :(( you know   3rd: I'm just straight up jealous. I will openly admit that.      I'm not looking for answers like (get over your self) I know I need to do that. I need advice on a positive way to go about it. Maybe some personal experiences would be nice.      also, if you know any steps that could get rid of my own insecurities. Please feel free to add them.      Thanks for listening

I am currently 14 dpo and started having light pink cm yesterday (the day after I expected AF). AF always comes with a warning. I generally begin cramping 3 days before and she is never, ever late.    I have been nauseous on and off for a week now and foods taste different. Things I once loved now make me sick. I am also more tired than normal with very irregular sleep patterns. I've also been urinating frequently.   I took a hpt yesterday. I used an equate (walmart brand) with the - or + reading. ( - in the window means not preg and + means preg) The test had a very very faint - . I have used this brand before and the - was always bright and easy to see, so I think I got a bad test. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Any help is appreciated!

Es que estoy bien preocupada porque mi beba de 16 meses aun no dice ni mami ni papi.. sin embargo ha dicho galleta y hasta su nombre, Adriana..    Tampogo sigue instruciones simples como dame eso, trae aquello... y cuando la llamo por su nombre casi nunca obtengo su atencion. La manera mas rapida es cuando le digo Adriana toma, porque sabe que le voy a dar algo.. ahi si me mira..    Tengo que a?adir que desde que empezo a ver caricaturas, todas eran en ingles y en la casa hablamos espa?ol.. se lo dije a la pediatra y esta me dijo que solo le pusiera television en espa?ol, de eso van 3 meses pero estuvo casi un a?o viendo tv en ingles.. y bueno pienso que eso la puede haber atrasado pero me preocupa mucho. Otro factor es que ella no comparte casi nunca (por no decir nunca) con otros ni?os porque no tengo familia aqui y cuando la llevo al parque pues aun es muy peque?a y no la puedo dejar que trepe sola en las atracciones con ni?os mucho mas grandes que ella.

20070508082900AAgAmHK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	3 Month Old Freak Outs When In Public. What is it??	My infant, whenever we go out to a friend or relative's house, will freak out.    She is great at home and when we are in the car, but the second I step into someone else's house and she catches a glimpse of ANYONE besides myself, she starts screaming at the top of her lungs. I've tried taking her into another room, a dark room, rocking her, feeding her, everything I can think of to comfort her. Eventually after maybe 30-45 minutes of screaming and trying a million comfort tactics, she'll calm down but as soon as she sees someone else's face or I try to hand her off she flips again. This makes it IMPOSSIBLE to go ANYWHERE.    Keep in mind she is fine at home and lets people hold her there but the second we are out.....      People suggest its colic but it has nothing to do with gas. What could it be?? Any suggestions??
