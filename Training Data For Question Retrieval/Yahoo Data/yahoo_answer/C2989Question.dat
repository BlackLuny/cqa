With all the talk about global warming, it seems like many alarmist keep talking CO2 but non mention sun spots, solar flares or solar storms. So which has the most influence on the surface temperature of the earth?
20090128155626AAVP5nS	Environment;Green Living	Eco-friendly facts you should know...?	here are some eco-friendly/going green facts i bet you didn't know...      I am a vegetarian and did you know that half of the water in america is used to feed animals raised for food. These animals are also responsible for 2/3 ofthe worlds greenhouse gases. Millions of these animals are raised each year. The united States doesn't even need that many animals to feed us each year,We overprovide.      Animals are abused for leather and wool. Believe it or not.      If every house in america changed ONE lightbulb to a flourescent light we could power 3 million houses in america for a year.      Did you know that recycling one aluminum can will save enough energy to power a TV for three hours? Did you know that 14 recycled plastic bottles yield enough fiberfill for a ski jacket?      by going to car washes the water is treated afterwards so that the harmful chemicals aren't released into the waterline.

20090128155003AAKT9cJ	Environment;Global Warming	What caused the planet to warm 0.5°C between 1945 and Present?	Since 1945, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO - one of the main 'natural cycles' people like to talk about) has had 1 warm cycle and 1 cool cycle of roughly equal and opposite strength.    http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/       Total solar irradiance has not changed by any significant amount since 1945.    http://www.mps.mpg.de/images/projekte/su...       Over that period, the planet warmed more than 0.5°C.    http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...       So what caused this global warming?  Please support your argument with scientific evidence.
20090128160351AAcZUtn	Environment;Global Warming	Wind turbines, HELP?!!!!!!!!?	Hey PLEASE READ ALL.   I remember in my Environmental studies class when i was in school, my teacher said that Wind turbines did not Power all the time, as because when it is not windy, they do not spin, therefor don't Create any power.      My Question was, why cant the design it so there is a fan attached onto the turbine somewhere so that it blows the turbine so it will never stop, thus causing the turbine to spin and Create power all the time? she seemed shocked and didn't know the answer.   Think about it, the people ive asked said, if the wind turbine stops, then the fan will not have any power and will also stop, BUT if it has a fan blowing it, once it starts, the fan will be blowing it all the time and will never stop as long as the turbine wont stop, which it wont because the fan wont stop.   The turbine wont stop if the fan doesn't stop, and the fan wont stop as long as the turbine wont stop.      Therefor it wont stop! and will always Create power and will always spin.      My question is, why don't they design a fan to the wind turbines? Or have they not fought of it yet?      lol, thanks for reading, i know this sounds stupid.

20090128161246AAN3ieP	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	What will the price be for 2010 Phoenix Electric SUT or SUV ?	I am curious what something like this car would sell for. They don't price on their website. So many models that don't look cool are going for $20k+       http://www.phoenixmotorcars.com    This model looks like a GM SUV, so I am wondering if it will be in the $40k or even $60k range.       I am looking for something cool, not a concept, and is around $20k being a new technology (being not so perfected or understood).

20090128161910AAQslm9	Environment;Green Living	How can I live more green?	How can I live more green?  So I am really trying as much as I can to live a little green. Now I'm only 13 years old so I can't really do so much with out my parent's help. So far I've been:    trying to turn of everything that I'm not using for electricity  recycling pop cans and papers at the school.  using those notebooks with recycled paper for school  riding my bike places  my parents are using those cloth bags for sacking up the groceries.    That's about all. We don't have actual recycling at our house but I recycle the work sheets at the school. I was talking to my parents about planting some trees at a bare area in our back yard and are thinking about it doing so. Is there more that I can do? Plus I don't get this: if cows are polluting the air from their farts, how is it bad that we're eating meat and better off being a vegetarian? I don't understand that so I would be really nice if someone could answer it!          Yup, my parents grow a garden every year as well. We use the plants to help keep some more money in our pockets and save a trip to the store. And yeah, I've already made the whole turning off the water while brushing my teeth a habit. =] Thank you for telling me how eating meat is some what bad. I totally understand now!    I myself have kind of been "advertising" for being a green person. My friends call me the "hippie" out of anyone that I am friends with. I've been telling people to recycle, plant trees, and such. I've also been kinda wearing it too! I wear a lot of shirts that have peace signs, or been good the the trees. I even have one that is black with a two trees and a bush running that says " run forest run!" with a bulldozer in the background looking like it's going to cut them down. So I've been doing my part as to spreading it around. =]

20090128145854AAxk7mi	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	How effectve can it be to refuse to buy gas powered cars and instead wait for an all-electric car to be made?	I got an email the other day that suggested that the car companies were dragging their feet at creating and releasing an all-electric car.  We have no leverage over the oil companies, but we do have the power to put an end to the vehicles the consume their products --- and that power comes from our ability to say, "No - I refuse to buy!"  To repeat, is this a reasonable approach for the American public to take as a means of forcing the auto companies into producing a reasonably priced electric car that can go at least 70 mph and be able to drive at least 120 miles or more per charge?

20090128170154AAZ1hNL	Environment;Green Living	Environmentalist....are electric/hybrid cars the real deal?	I never understood the mainstream fascination with these things.  Most of our electricity comes from coal.  Coal is worse then gas, even "clean coal."  Personally, I'd prefer a small compact like a Civic or moped.      Is this whole hybrid thing just greenwashing?  Or is there a point here that I'm missing.  Personally I won't mind more nuclear energy but I know many other environments don't like that idea so much.
