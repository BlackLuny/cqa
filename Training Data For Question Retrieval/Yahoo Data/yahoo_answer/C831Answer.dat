Top with parm cheese. ( I don't measure when I cook so, add more butter or garlic depending on how much spaghetti you make and how much you like garlic.    tip: to peel and crush garlic quick, lay on a flat surface and crush with side of a wide knife. ie butcher knife. skin peels away without any effort, then mince or chop garlic to desired size.

(:<br>  <br>  Only one in a family of carnivores, but they've gotten used to it, and so have I. Vegetarianism wasn't a rebellion thing for me, it's just what I felt was right, and I think after a few months they accepted that.<br>  <br>  But then again. I was seven. Seven year olds don't really rebel. xD|`|r0xeCZAQaa	I became a vegetarian when I was 16 (what hell! my family hated me, and life was not very bearable until I left home).  <br>  <br>  When I was 21, I became high raw by accident -- I was young, carrying 18 to 21-credit course loads in college, and married to a man who worked nights in a restaurant, so I did not have a lot of food prep time, and I made "progressive salads", adding things each day as I ate up most of what I had made the day before, then making a soup on the fifth day.  Around that time, I found a raw food recipe book (Live Foods, by the Fathmans <br>  ( <a href="http://tinyurl.com/LiveFoodFathman" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/LiveFoodFathman</a> ) and began to make more interesting things (bought myself a food processor that would be considered a dinosaur now, for $125 -- a big expenditure in 1973) <br>  <br>   When my husband died, I went totally raw, at 26.  I am 56 now.  I have been 85% to 100% raw vegan ever since (sometimes I have "sort of" quit -- eating cooked food and even meat on occasion, if I felt like it.)<br>  <br>  I am high raw now.  I say I am high raw because that denomination now exists and  I do not necessarily know what I will decide to eat tomorrow.   I only prepare raw vegan food in my home, and that is the way I eat, and has been for at least the past 10 years, but I am old enough that I understand that I cannot guarantee tomorrow, and I do not want it to happen that you see me eating something that is not raw vegan and say I am a liar.|`|gNuca7FUaa	I became a vegetarian about two weeks ago.<br>  im fourteen.<br>  it was the best decision i have ever made.<br>  i feel healthier, and happy that im saving some animals.<br>  <br>  i'll become a vegan once im eighteen.<br>  i still need nutrition i guess.<br>  <br>  I used to eat junk food, alot of starch and meat.<br>  but after i gave up meat, it was easy to let go of the junk food.<br>  i know that might sound stupid since im nto far in, but I have dedication.<br>  <br>  oh and the rest of my family are carnivores.<br>  there okay wiht my lifestyle change.<br>  they even support me.<br>  :)|`|BVgVYn26aa	Good for you!

yXno8yIkaa	You'll have to watch it, considering every oven is different. I'd  toast the bread on both sides, then add your toppings, and then broil it for 2 minutes to heat the toppings and melt the cheese. It will be easier if your tomatoes and other toppings are room temperature rather then cold from the fridge.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|FT9Krq8xaa	Two minutes to toast the bread sounds ok but you may need a bit longer to cook the tomatoes. Just watch and if they look mushy they'll be done.

The precise origins of the recipe are unknown, although a version appears in the 4th century CE Roman cookbook, often attributed to Apicius ("Aliter dulcia: siligineos rasos frangis, et buccellas maiores facies. in lacte infundis, frigis [et] in oleo, mel superfundis et inferes." - "Another sweet: Break grated Sigilines (a kind of wheat bread), and make larger bites.

In the case of a breakup, not telling him doesn't matter.  What he doesn't know won't affect him.    But in the case of marriage, not telling him isn't a choice.  He will find out eventually.  If you don't tell him early, this will hurt very badly later.  It is a form of lying, no matter your motivation for it.  Not telling him now would ruin an otherwise successful relationship.  Of course, telling him now could ruin it as well.    I would say that the longer you can say you've been sober, the less likely you are to scare him off.

But at the same time, you really should tell him, in a low-stress way because alcohol is a ubiquitous and normal part of America's social life and he needs to know what kind of limits you need to set to stay healthy so he can understand how his relationship with you might affect the activities he can and can not continue.|`|8bb58b256a91c180d8b6c1bd11605c17aa	be honest. Just don't bring up everything you did when you were drinking. Some things are better to keep to yourself|`|geih5vR8aa	You gotta be honest with him.     If he has had bad experience with alcoholics before, then he may have difficulties with it. Like, if his parents were alcoholics, and abused him as a child.    If he hasn't had any experiences with it, then he may not seem to care, because he may not realize the severity of what being an alcoholic is.    How?  Make him a kick *** dinner. Tell him during dessert.
hKlsJgVSaa	Isn't it amazing how people can totally miss out on points you make clear?    I prefer mine boiled, then fried in butter with another pat of fresh butter and salt or seasoned salt but I could see how that could get old.    I have seen recipes using them in a salad. I will look for it again.    You could do the whole thing where you boil them, and then pan fry in butter and then you could toss in hot wing sauce, and if  you like bule cheese you could give it a sprinkle wor blue cheese cumbles and chopped celery.    Or drizzle ranch and hot suace mixed together.      Pan fry with some bacon, onion, and garlic.    Sprinkle liberally with fresh parsley, and parmesan cheese.|`|4de3da5babb437b65a9e55c075cdbbdeaa	I love pierogies, but don't eat them the traditional way.

dnGJ5JLgaa	Becoming vegetarian and vegan is healthy and good decision but sometimes it can be unhealthy because your body doesn't get the proper nutrients.    But my friend she is a vegertarien here is what she eats she wants to be a vegan but her parents won't let her.  She doesn't like fish:    Pasta  Tofu  Alfafa  All vegetables  All fruit  Energy Bars  Beans  Burrittos  Soup ( no meat or anything)  Dark Chocolate  Whole Wheat Everything  and that's all that I remember that she eats from lunch.    good luck! |`|geih5vR8aa	No.  You don't have to eat meat for profit. You can eat it to be healthy.    You get protein from Soy milk and nuts and beans.    You can never fully replace the nutrients you get from cheese and eggs, or red meat. You can take vitamin supplements to help.     My dad went Vegan about 3 months ago... he likes how it makes him feel. He's not as tired as he was before... BUT, he does it for health reasons... so every now and then he'll have something with meat in it. For instance, if we go to neighbors house for dinner, or around the holidays, for Thanksgiving and stuff like that, then he'll eat meat.    Humans are Omnivores. You should never completely deprive your diet of meat, but we probably eat 1000% more than what we should eat. I think I read that we should eat red meat once or twice a month.    I've been thinking about switching and at least trying to cut down on my meat intake... but it's hard to do, especially when you go out with friends a lot... and if you have a friend who's a chef... and I love to cook as well. It's hard to cut out meat, cheese, milk and eggs when you cook.|`|sLt1I4lKaa	http://www.vegan.org/about_veganism/inde...    Click on the link above. I think it will help.|`|HSOp9J4Iaa	First of all you need to eat mostly RAW foods,   Spirulina and Hemp Seed protein is the must!!!!  goji Berries, Flex seed oil, Wheet shats, and reed the book  David Wolf "eating for beauty"
kAfZaLwraa	We don't grow coffee in Seattle. I don't know of any producers in this state, in fact. I believe that the only place that coffee is grown in the US is Hawaii.    Coffee, like chocolate, is generally imported. Coffee comes mainly from Central and South America. (It grows elsewhere, but those are the big ones. Africa and Southeast Asia + the Pacific Isles are other top contributors.)|`|rY2dq8foaa	I don't know why people on yahoo don't just look up what they want to know on Google, Wikipedia, and the many other search engines on the internet out there. Anyways Seattle's Best Coffee a subsidiary of Starbucks is a specialty coffee retailer and wholesaler based in Seattle. They have retail stores and grocery sub-stores in 20 states and provinces and the District of Columbia. Seattle's Best brewed coffee is also sold in Canada in many locations including Chapters, Indigo Books and Music, and Mac's Convenience Stores. Coffee beans are found and cultivated in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa so they are imported into North America where production process occurs (roasting, the making of different blends etc.) As for Caff Appassionato you will see on their website  "Caff Appassionato  located in Seattle, WA  Coffee Capital of the US."  So I am sure this establishment is getting their coffee beans from somewhere in Latin America (Columbia), Southeast Asia, and Africa. They obtain many different types of coffee beans and then roast and produce the many blends they sell in America. And no coffee beans are not grown in Seattle. It is possible to grow coffee trees in the certain areas of the U.S.A. but with great difficulty (Coffee trees do best close to the equator). First of all you might be able to grow a few trees but there is no way you would be successful in growing a large number of trees. Secondly it takes coffee trees up to 4-5 years to produce beans. The coffee tree wants a temperature range between 65 & 75 degrees and 50 inches of rain distributed throughout the year. Coffee trees also require a particular type of soil, a certain elevation, and a certain amount of sun and shade. |`|FPJSoxYwaa	There are a lot of companies that distribute coffee which are based in Seattle that is why.|`|jNUYkCZxaa	Good question cuz I know alot of the coffee comes from Arabia and Columbia and it's really hot in those two places. Seattle gets snow doesn't it? Haha you have me very curious now.
vLZePBDhaa	So called experts say it does, but I have trouble finding the time.|`|u5opWQr4aa	 I hardly believe that breakfast helps that much. I almost NEVER eat breakfast (Unless a cup of tea or coffee counts), and I am an A/B student who almost never has homework because of my efficiency. I also never have to study or cram, so it can't help too much, right? Plus the main reason I drink coffee is the taste, and it helps me stop being too lazy to get ready for school.|`|hkw4LbARaa	It speeds up you metabolism and gives you energy|`|I1oAAKwMaa	it does because it helps you not crash in the middle of the day, ur not hungry so u dont think abt lunch all the time. there also studies that show an increase in productivity because ur concentration is better|`|ilq63yTlaa	I GOT SICK AND MY DOCTOR ASKED IF I ATE BREAKFAST AND SHE SAID THAT IF YOU DONT EAT IN THE MORNINGS YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS WEAKER AND YOUR BRAIN WORKS 15%LESS OF ITS POTENTIAL THEN IF YOU WOULD HAVE EATEN TRUST ME IT WORKS TO EAT BREAKFAST I JUST STARTED AND I FEEL MORE ALERT AND THINK FASTER    (sorry bout caps didnt see)|`|ISAA101kaa	Yes it does help a lot.  Breakfast should be the most important food source of the day.  If you eat a good breakfast than you can go longer in the day without worrying if you get hungry in the afternoon.  Depending on your metabolism.  If you cant get to lunch than eating a big breakfast will last until dinner.  You can have more energy if you eat good in the morning.  Get up earlier in the morning to have time for breakfast|`|AA11372183	I decided not to eat breakfast to lose weight once. but it really did affect my day! it's very important.|`|Bj82hxBeaa	It does for me. I like to make a smoothie in the morning using soy milk, frozen fruit, ground flax seed, and ice. When I don't have the time I usually just grab a yougurt. 
B9Jpwlt4aa	FOOD CO OPS!  God's gift to healthy people everywhere ;-)    Here's a directory: http://www.coopdirectory.org/directory.h...    Someone mentioned Whole Foods, I see?  Don't bother.  They are the biggest rip off since Wild Oats :-P    EDIT: Sorry, I probably should have added more details.  My personal fav is Clif (brand)'s Mojo bars.  My PB & J flavor is amazing, but I like all of them.  Here's a list of other good, vegan bars:  Luna (women's health bar)  Clif   LaraBar (best, totally NATURAL energy bar)    And you should be able to find all this in your average natural food co op.    Just looking around should give you ideas.  Pretty much everything in those stores is gonna be good and healthy.    Double score if yours has a deli!  One of mine does, it's amazing.    Best of luck!|`|6Gfz125Paa	That's going to be difficult and expensive.  See if there is a health foods store like Whole Foods near you.|`|aCDWwsisaa	If you are a 14-year-old girl and you eat an exclusively vegetarian diet you will be a sickly adult.  You are still growing and maturing, and this cannot & will not happen properly without the full range of proteins your body needs (and would normally derive from a regular omnivore's diet).    If you want to become a vegetarian for reasons of conscience AFTER your body has finished growing, you are to be admired for that; but to do so at 14 is just inviting a lifetime of health issues, especially for a girl.    Just ask your doctor...|`|A5gfxSyzaa	Do you have a farmer's market in your area?  Studies have been done to show that nutritionally it's actually better to eat fresh produce then organic.  An apple picked today is better then one shipped from three states away.  The nice thing about a farmers market is that it's local, and often organic too.    Trader Joes and Whole foods carry many organic foods.  Some grocery stores do - Safeway has a whole line of products called O organic.    You should have more then an energy bar to start the day - try a veggie omlete or eggs and toast or fake sausage and peanut butter toast or something more balanced.    104 is not a healthy weight for someone 5'8".  You say you don't want to hear it but there is a reason people think you look too thin.|`|AA11963065	I do the same.  It's more expensive to eat all organic.. In the summer I grow my own veggies and go to the farmers market.. In the winter, I buy frozen organic fruit and make smoothies.  Some foods are OK to eat if you peel them..i.e. oranges.. others like pears are not.. Potato's are really bad for you unless they are organic.. The place to find organic energy bars is your local health food store.. even GNC has a few.  Stay away from them and eat fresh veggies and fruits.. Whole grains too.  Don't worry about what other people think.. As long as you take a vitamin "B" supplement since you're not eating beef.  Talk to your Dr. when you see him/her. Most are supportive of your lifestyle choice.  Mine is.     There is a place called Wildly Natural Foods online as well as:    www.wholefoodsmarket.com      Google organic food online and you will find a lot..     Grocery stores are now carrying a lot more as well.. Try a large Safeway store and if your store doesn't have what you want, tell the manager.  They will usually get it in eventually cuz many are going organic now..     BTW, look up the value of wheat grass.. easy to grow and juice.. www.wheatgrasskits.com |`|FxWppY7Baa	learn to cook and buy whole foods and stay away from foods like energy bars (these are NOT Natural, not even the organic ones). research what makes up a well balanced vegetarian diet (snack chips soy milk and energy bars is not balanced).     Eat lots of veggies and fruits. Be sure to include nuts and dried beans for protein. Shop the produce aisle or better yet the farmers market. Stay away from things in boxes, they expensive and stripped of nutrition.    A good breakfast would be oatmeal with fresh fruit on top, a glass of juice and toast with peanutbutter, not an energy bar.
UFkYNq9Raa	No.  Red bell peppers are just green bell peppers that have been left on the plant to ripen more.  Subsequently they are sweet, and not spicy at all.|`|aWknctzTaa	they are all sweet to me but thats my opinion  (cooked or uncooked)|`|BWxSSADaaa	Not at all!  They are actually quite sweet.  To bring out the sweetness even more, you can hold them over a flame until the skin blisters and turns black.  Do this all over the pepper.  Then, rinse it under cool water and peel and discard the skin.  The resulting roasted pepper will be soft and quite sweet.  You can slice it into strips and top pizza, use it in pasta sauces or pasta salads, mix into some hummus, whatever you like!  :-)|`|3vBALAlaaa	No they aren't spicy because they aren't small. Only small peppers are hot. This is because the chemicals that give your tongue that burning sensation, aka, how spicy it is, are compacted together, so you experiences the burning sensation all at once. However, the big peppers, such as red, yellow, and green, distribute the chemicals evenly, so you don't burn you. My advice, eat red peppers, they have 100% of vitamin C! Or another vitamin, I can't remember. Hope I cleared things up for you!!|`|FswyqTjYaa	Not at all... Bell peppers (red, yellow, green and orange) are sometimes grouped with less pungent pepper varieties as "sweet peppers".|`|bd2502bab3c35dd94819ef873dd90e55aa	no and they're delicious just sliced with some salt!|`|llkSmgLJaa	Red bell peppers are sweet. They are ripe green bell peppers. Green and red cayenne pepper are the hot spicy peppers.|`|b9uOax0aaa	No,  Green, yellow, red bell peppers pretty much all taste the same.
zQbpJmESaa	Step1Look for the Best Life seal throughout the grocery store. You'll find it on items ranging from pasta, breads, cereals, teas, oils, soups and snacks.   Step2Check the ingredients in the bread aisle. Some breads claiming to be multi-grain or 7-grain, have no whole grain in them. Instead, get bread made with 100 percent whole grains.   Step3Wrap your sandwich. The Best Life Diet's seal is on Flat-Out wraps. They come in multigrain, chipotle, Italian herb, brown sugar and other flavors.   3 MORE STEP  http://www.ehow.com/how_2238444_find-bes...|`|MojYmo5Jaa	Skinless Chicken, Fish, Low Calorie Soups, Sweet Potato, Veg, Any Meat grilled to drain off the fat in small proportion, Low calorie Puds.    You need to eat foods that fill you up but are low in calories, otherwise you will be starving all day and more likely to resist to temptation.|`|l8ddp0F3aa	Add fiber to regular foods, like Benefiber powder (I swear you can't tell it's there when you mix it into things like yogurt, spaghetti sauce, etc.).  Eating higher fiber foods is a good idea too.  Try to go as "whole" or "raw" as you can - the farther from processed foods you get, the healthier/more wholesome they are.  You will still need fats and protein; almonds are a great snack and a great source of good fat, protein, and omega-3s.      I lost stubborn baby weight just by eating a salad and a bowl of fresh fruit BEFORE every meal.  If I was still hungry after eating those things, I ate WHATEVER I wanted.  It worked for me because I didn't deprive myself but I was still getting the healthy foods.|`|1oUkOnNLaa	celery because you use up more callories eating it than you actually gain from it once youve eaten it !|`|qZQ3aoRjaa	I agree about the celery. To add some protein top it with some peanut butter. A tsp of peanut butter on a stalk of celery is only about 50 calories.
axxQzOCHaa	Depends on the individual's sleep cycle / work schedule. I used to work graveyard (11pm - 7am) as a Front Desk Agent in a hotel, so it wasn't unusual to have some java at 3am. But generally speaking it's drunk more in the morning.|`|xrRZeROmaa	That depends on their sleep cycle.  When I was working 4:00 PM till Midnight, I drank more at night.  Coffee is a stimulant.

wE0v8LRnaa	The fat is where a lot of the flavor is.  Cut it off after cooking|`|4qT0TfMZaa	You're to be commended for not wanting a lot of fat on your meat - but don't forget that fat is where the flavor comes from.  I always trim away excess fat with a knife.  The person who suggested a foreman grill offered a good idea - I have two of 'em and he (she) is right - that's a good way to cook away more of the fat.  Even though they're made with a non-stick surface, I always spray mine with no-stick spray like Pam - it makes 'em so much easier to clean after use.  The leanest cuts of meat have the least flavor - but you can do something about that by marinating your meat for a couple hours before slapping it on the grill.  I find any Teriyaki sauce, right from the bottle, to be excellent for that, and I'm sure you can find barbecue sauces you'd really like for the same purpose.  Have your beefsteak sliced 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick so it absorbs the sauce you soak it in and then cooks quickly once ya put it on the grill.|`|Y0O6971laa	Well, you could get the cow to do a few jumping jacks :)|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Cut if off and make sure to cook it well to get rid of residual fat.|`|6wNbnZNKaa	id say keep it on the steak while cooking for flavor. but before you eat it, cut it off.|`|AA10358331	You wanna keep the fat on till its done cooking. The marbling (the fat that is laced through the meat) is very good for the steak, it makes it very tender and moist.

CksviCiTaa	 Por lo que se ve no eres mexicana ni tienes experiencia en las tortillas, se te va a hacer muy dificil preparar los tacos para tantas gentes    amiga, mi consejo es que compres tortillas o les prepares otra cosa, es muchisimo trabajo el hacer para 60 personas, porque se comen muchos tacos cada uno       ademas, no sabemos si quieres hacer las de harina o las de maiz, porque mucha gente las confunde    de todos modos ahi te van las dos recetas  y consejos      Tortillas de maiz    Ingredientes:   1 taza de harina de maz (Maseca por ejemplo)   1/2 taza de agua fra   sal al gusto   una cucharada de harina de trigo   una pizca de polvo de hornear  Modo de preparar:  1. Prende el comal para que se caliente.  2. Mezcla los ingredientes secos y luego  a?ade el agua y amasa con las manos, hasta conseguir una masa que no quede muy seca, pero tampoco muy pegajosa.  3. Haz bolitas del tama?o de una pelota de golf.  4. Corta dos crculos de plstico de unos 20 o 25 cm. de dimetro.   5. Se coloca un crculo en la torti llera, luego una bolita de masa, luego el otro crculo, y se aplasta. Si no tienes torti llera, puedes aplastarlas con la base de un plato o con un palote. La tortilla debe quedar lo ms fina posible, pero no demasiado, para que, al despegarla del plstico, no se rompa.  6. Pon la tortilla en el comal (sin engrasar), cuando veas que los bordes estn secos, dale vuelta con una pala. Cuando est ya cocida por el otro lado, vuelve a voltear. Y cuando empieza a esponjarse, scala del comal.  7. Ve colocando las tortillas recin hechas en un recipiente o plato, tapado con algo, para que no se enfren y tampoco se rompan al doblarlas            aqui te dejo una receta para que mas o menos te des una idea de las cantidades     Carne Especial Para Tacos y Tortas  (para 6-8 personas)   Ingredientes:   - 1/2 taza de aceite   - 1 kilo de pierna de puerco  - lavada y cortada en cuadritos peque?os   - 10 chiles chilacates chicos   - 5 jitomates peque?os   - 2 hojas de laurel   - 4 pimientas enteras  - 1/2 taza de vinagre   - 1 diente de ajo y sal al gusto   - 60 tortillas de maz   Preparacin:   Se pone el aceite en la olla express a calentar y se agrega la carne.   Se fre durante 10 minutos aproximadamente.   Se a?aden las hojas de laurel, las pimientas y la sal, se tapa y se deja cocer 40 minutos.   Mientras tanto, se lavan los chilacates y se les quita la cabeza y las semillas.   Se pone a cocer la pura pulpa junto con los jitomates.  (Si no se quiere muy enchiloso, trese el agua del primer hervor y sustituya el agua de nuevo).   Una vez cocidos se muelen con un poco de sal, el vinagre y el diente de ajo.   Esta mezcla se a?ade a la carne que ya estar cocida y se deja hervir de nuevo.  Verifquelo de sal.        esta es la receta de las de harina pero son mas dificiles que las de maiz (para quien no tiene experiencia en hacerlas)        Tortillas de Harina     30 tortillas  ingredientes:  1 taza de manteca  2-1/2 tazas de agua  7 tazas de harina de trigo (de la normal para pasteles por ejemplo)  1 cucharadita de sal  3 cucharaditas de polvo para  hornear  preparacin:  Disuelva la manteca a?adiendo agua poco a poco. Mezcle la harina, la sal, y el polvo de  hornear en un tazn y a?ada la manteca ya disuelta. Amsela bien hasta formar una pasta  suave. Cubra la masa con una tela y deje reposar por media hora. Forme pelotitas de ms  o menos 2 pulgadas de dimetro y 1/2 pulgada de grueso. Aplane cada pelotita sobre una  superficie enharinada hasta que quede de unas 7 pulgadas de dimetro, usando un rodillo  o una clavija de 1 pulgada. En una plancha muy caliente deje cocer cada tortilla por 20  segundos, dle la vuelta y deje cocer por 40 segundos. Voltee la tortilla, apriete con una  tela gruesa, y deje cocer, dndole vuelta cada 20 segundos hasta que est lista. |`|SLJkvh4Eaa	Hola amiga  Las tortillas se rompen cuando no estan bien calentadas.   Las de tortillera funcionan perfectamente si las calientas hasta que dejen de soltar vapor.  Si quieres hacerlas te conviene usar masa de paquete, solo le agregas agua y opcionalmente un poco de harina de trigo y aceite para que sean mas elsticas.    Calcula seis tacos por persona y un kilo de carne por cada seis personas porque se reduce al cocinarla.  Recuerda hacer una buena salsa.    Espero que estas breves indicaciones te sirvan.

Un problema comn tratando de usar MASECA fuera de Mxico es el cambio de agua, lo cual afecta la tortilla (es imposible que sepan igual que las hechas en Mxico).    Te doy 3 consejos para evitar que se rompan:    1. Agrega un chorrito de aceite a la masa, para que te le de mayor consistencia (no mucho).    2. Deja las tortillas lo ms delgadas posibles (para que se cuezan ms fcil y sea ms sencillo doblarlas o enrollarlas)    3. Me late que no tienes comal, as que un sartn al ser ms grueso y con tefln no est hecho para tortillas. Tienes que tenerle un poco ms de paciencia y dejar que las tortillas se cuezan completamente antes de retirarlas del fuego.    Para la cantidad de tortillas por persona calcula 5. Para la carne, calcula 150 gramos por persona (120 si la mayora son mujeres) y seguro te sobra un poco.    Mucha suerte!!!

If eggs & milk are ok, then a quick mac & cheese would probably suffice - how about some cut fruit on the side.  If the kiddo is a vegan (no animal no way) then you could make some pasta (toss with olive oil, garlic & parsley) or how about bean quesadillas (vegetarian refried beans in tortillas, toast in a pan ala grilled cheese style).      Lastly, you may want to wait until the kiddo gets to your place so you know what kind of dinner he or she usually eats.  In a pinch, my kids love buttered noodles and could eat it three meals a day.    Good luck & have fun!

I'm a vegan, my spouse is not.. If the child is a vegetarian, most likely his folks will have "meatless" hamburger in the house.. I even smuggle it in the food I make for meat eaters.. You can make tacos out of it too. If you have no meat at all, use tomato sauce and add garlic/onion powder w/ a little sea salt and pepper.. If they eat cheese or soy cheese add that to the top.. Personally, shouldn't the parents supply the food for the child? Unless it is for you.. when all else fails, whole grain cereal with fresh berries and soy or rice milk is always good.  Or, even an organic baked potato with soy butter is healthy.. I throw a little flax seed on it for fiber.. anything is better than meat.  Good luck..

Tryptophan is one of the 20 standard amino acids, as well as an essential amino acid in the human diet. It is encoded in genetic code as the codon UGG. Only the L-stereoisomer of tryptophan is used in structural or enzyme proteins, but the D-stereoisomer is occasionally found in naturally produced peptides (for example, the marine venom peptide contryphan).[2] The distinguishing structural characteristic of tryptophan is that it contains an indole functional group.
RoicHy87aa	there wouldn't be cross contamination. people are allergic to peanuts so factories and stuff really have to be cautious about that. i really wouldn't worry about it.|`|z0Ynd4zRaa	No, you're fine. They would have recalled that too.
	Yes, they are! Actually, boxed breakfast cereals are no where near healthy, no matter if they are labeled "high fiber," "low-fat," "low sugar," etc. Cereal is not only filled with sugar and preservatives, but it is are also void of any real nutrients. The extrusion process by which cereals are made destroy the grain's naturally occurring vitamins, minerals, and enzymes (because the grains are subjected to extremely high temperatures). Then the extruded grains are revitaminized to make up for this nutrient loss. The revitamization process involves coating the cereal with SYNTHETIC vitamins and minerals. Many studies have shown that these synthetic (or isolated) vitamins and minerals are not readily absorbed by the body as the vitamins and minerals found in whole foods.    Also, any boxed or packaged ready-to-eat product that stays fresh for 2-3 years already TELLS you that there is nothing live in it (living food contains beneficial enzymes which cause it to spoil after a couple of days or weeks). Since cereal doesn't spoil, it is another sign that it is not healthy for you. But boxed pasta is a different story, because you have to COOK it first. Any uncooked grain can last quite a while (up to 5 years), but once cooked, it spoils rather quickly (think molded bread).    Not only do cereals lack real nutrition, but they also packed with artificial ingredients, such as artificial flavors and colors (think Lucky Charm's bright marshmellows). Also, cereals usually contain a cheap form of sweetener besides sugar called high fructose corn syrup, which studies have shown to be very bad for you. High fructose corn syrup can actually make your body store more fat. Just research it and find out for yourself. Also, cereals usually have a chemical food additive called BHT added to it to "maintain freshness" so the cereal doesn't turn stale. But BHT is a very dangerous chemical. It has been linked to birth defects and cancer.    So breakfast cereal companies have been fooling Americans for a good too many years with their marketing schemes, and it's about time the truth be revealed. I'm glad to hear that there is some truth leaking out, and I hope it will continue.    So my personal advice to you is to avoid boxed breakfast cereals. I was hooked on them when I was a child because that was all my parents really fed us for breakfast...so it was pretty difficult to get off of it. But it worked when I decided to trade my cold cereal for some very heathly HOT cereal. I now regularly make oatmeal and multi-grain hot cereals and I love them. It does take a little time out of your day because you have to cook and prepare them but so what? I few minutes a day is SOO worth your health, don't you think?|`|	Cereal can either be very nutritious or very bad. The kids cereals are for the most part junk. When buying cereal, I look for minimal sugar, high fiber, high vitamins, and low fat. Some cereals market whole grains and that's great but the amount of fiber, vitamins and minerals tells the true story on the wholesomeness. Most of the healthy cereal tends to be bland so I don't mind a little sugar. But things like fruity pebbles have been processed so far away from the original product (rice) that it has no nutritional value. Cereal can be very nutritious. Read the labels, not the garbage on the front.|`|	Confused at the breakfast cereal aisle? You are not alone. The cereal aisle is changing. I went to the supermarket to pick up a box of my usual cereal a few days ago and was overwhelmed by the endless rows of colored boxes on tightly packed shelves. I was curious enough to stop and take a look - and was surprised by the numerous health claims and health logos found on the boxes. Here are my observations:    Cereals with a Heart Disease Health Claim: Go for It!  These breakfast cereals claim to "help reduce the risk of heart disease" and yes they possibly can. These claims are approved by the FDA as these cereals contain certain heart-health friendly ingredients such as whole grains, psyllium and oats. They are usually low in fat and high in fiber. Examples are cereals containing 100% wheat or bran, oat bran and barley. Unlike the refined corn or rice cereals, these whole grain cereals are not as rapidly digested and absorbed. Therefore you'll feel full longer and will be less likely to prowl around for pre-lunch snacks.      Cereals with Fruits: It's not bad. It depends.  Many cereals now have been added with real freeze-dried berries, apples and bananas. However, fruits are usually added in low-fiber refined-grain cereals. Therefore it is a better option if you toss in your own fresh fruits to high-fiber cereals. However, this type of cereals is not a bad choice, if you are trying to lure your kids away from eating the sugar-loaded frosted cereals.      Cereals with a Weight Loss Claim: Just fancy marketing.  Quite a few brands of cereal were found with claims to help you "lose up to x lb in x weeks". These cereals are often low in fat - but the majority of breakfast cereals are low in fat anyway. There is really nothing special about them. Kellogg's Special K, for instance, disappointingly has only 1g of fiber per serving. For more waistline friendly cereals, choose high fiber whole grain cereals instead.      Cereals with novelty ingredients: Read the label please.  It is not difficult to find cereals added with other ingredients such as pecans, almonds or flaxseed. Some cereals are even made with soy too. Since there are so many varieties, it's best to read the nutritional fact labels when comparing products - specifically look for the fiber content as well as the sugar content.       Bottom Line: Breakfast is an important meal to start off your day. Studies showed that athletes who ate breakfast performed better in competition; kids who ate breakfast were able to concentrate more in class; adults who ate breakfast were able to control weight better than those who did not eat breakfast. The recommended intake of fiber is 25 g per day; therefore choose breakfast cereals with at least 5 g of fiber per serving (many cereals with 100% whole grains have much higher amounts of fiber). When reading nutrition labels, also pay attention to the sugar content. Cereals with fruits usually have higher sugar content|`|	Many cereals are very unhealthy.  You must READ the labels to see if they are worth buying.  I know that oatmeal. cream of wheat or cream of rice is healthy for you and some of the Bran cereals as well.  Like I said read the label the whole story is there.  The FDA did that for us so we should take advantage of it.|`|	Sadly, it is true.  Most cereals are LOADED with sugar, artificial colors, preservatives, trans fats, and other unhealthy stuff.  If you read the ingredients, it may contain one "whole grain" but that does not mean that grain was nutritionally sound to begin with.  Most grains are genetically modified (frankenfoods), and have been processed to the point that they are not as healthy as they sound-same with "multi" grain-it just means there is more than one grain, but again, it may not be good ones.  Notice, too, the serving size of most cereal is 1/3 cup.  Most people eat a bowl full, which would contain about 2 cups-which means you have to account for the calories and other ingredients in an amount equivalent to the amount you actually consume.  I don't know of anyone who only eats 1/3 cup!  That's less than a small hand full!   Its very deceptive marketing, but apparently it works-for everyone but the consumer.  Also, the iron in "iron enriched or fortified" foods is from iron shavings-NOT the type of iron the human body can digest!  If you crush up iron fortified cereal, place it in a zipper bag and hold a magnet to it, you will find little tiny shavings of metal.  No thanks!!  I will stick with my oatmeal, made from whole oat groats.
AA10928232	I like the sauce recipe  below, but pair it w/ the meatball recipe from the 2nd one below.      Mark Strausmans Tomato Sauce  --Makes about 9 cups     If you are preparing this recipe in August or September, use fresh plum tomatoes, which are at the height of their season then. Cut them into large pieces, and run them through the food mill just as you would canned tomatoes. Slow cooking will allow the skin to melt into the sauce. For canned tomatoes, Mark likes to use Italian plum tomatoes from the Italian San Marzano Valley. ("CENTO" is one brand.)    4 (28 oz) cans whole Italian plum tomatoes   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil   3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced   1 tsp. crushed red-pepper flakes   1 cup Chianti or dry red wine   1 Tbsp. dried oregano   8 leaves fresh basil   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste    Pure tomatoes in a food mill, removing most of the seeds. In a medium stockpot, heat olive oil over medium heat, add garlic, and saut until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add red-pepper flakes. While oil is sizzling, slowly add half of the pured tomatoes and the wine, stirring to mix. Add remaining tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and let simmer. Add oregano, and continue to simmer until slightly thickened, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. The sauce may be kept in the refrigerator up to 3 or 4 days in an airtight plastic container or in the freezer for up to 1 month.  ------------------------    REAL MEATBALLS & SPAGHETTI    For the meatballs:   1/2 pound ground veal   1/2 pound ground pork  1 pound ground beef  1 cup fresh white bread crumbs (4 slices, crusts removed)   1/4 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs   2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese  2 teaspoons kosher salt   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg   1 extra-large egg, beaten   Vegetable oil   Olive oil   For the sauce:   1 tablespoon good olive oil   1 cup chopped yellow onion (1 onion)   1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic   1/2 cup good red wine, such as Chianti   1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, or plum tomatoes in puree, chopped   1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley   1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   For serving:   1? lbs. spaghetti, cooked according to package directions   Freshly grated Parmesan   Place the ground meats, both bread crumbs, parsley, Parmesan, salt, pepper, nutmeg, egg, and 3/4 cup warm water in a bowl. Combine very lightly with a fork. Using your hands, lightly form the mixture into 2-inch meatballs. You will have 14 to 16 meatballs.   Pour equal amounts of vegetable oil and olive oil into a large (12-inch) skillet to a depth of 1/4-inch. Heat the oil. Very carefully, in batches, place the meatballs in the oil and brown them well on all sides over medium-low heat, turning carefully with a spatula or a fork. This should take about 10 minutes for each batch. Don't crowd the meatballs. Remove the meatballs to a plate covered with paper towels. Discard the oil but don't clean the pan.   For the sauce, heat the olive oil in the same pan. Add the onion and saute over medium heat until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Add the wine and cook on high heat, scraping up all the brown bits in the pan, until almost all the liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, parsley, salt, and pepper.   Return the meatballs to the sauce, cover, and simmer on the lowest heat for 25 to 30 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through. Serve hot on cooked spaghetti and pass the grated Parmesan.     --Barefoot Contessa Family Style cookbook|`|AA11263103	brown meat and mushrooms.   add can tomatoes (stewed) must be broken down   Add red wine   simmer until reduced   then add Artichoke hearts  I made this up and my parents and grandparents love it!!

sQ4p7tktaa	Hi,  I am in a similar situation.  But I get a little more money to spend each week.  First, did you sign up for food assistance through your local county? It is pretty bad for everyone that is not rich, and the food stamps will go a long way.  If it is just you I would suggest to also go to some churches or food pantries, most of the times they have veggies and other fresh items.    Tuna Fish   Canned veggies with no salt added  Inexpensive Pasta   Frozen Veggies  Fresh Veggies  Rolls of frozen turkey meat   Flour  Bread  Corn chips  Oatmeal    That is just a general list...    Ramen noodles are like the worse food you can eat.       Also check for store specials. There are bins that have food that is marked down when it is not popular. Sometimes it is the organic or healthy stuff!    Hope that helps.  I figure though with 20 every 2 weeks, that is very hard.

rsTB7D1zaa	Lots of people don't want to join AA or support groups, for various reasons.  That's OK.  In fact, most heavy drinkers can stop drinking successfully on their own.    In my book, alcoholism doesn't refer to how much or how frequently you drink.  It refers to what you do to drink -- if you'll put alcohol ahead of your friends, family, or job.  Going to work drunk and getting fired is a good example of alcoholism.  Getting divorced because you are always drinking would also be alcoholism.  You said drinking was ruining things in your life -- I'm not sure exactly what this means and its by no means my place to say whether or not you are an alcoholic.  I can tell you the last person that recognizes alcoholism would be the alcoholic themselves.    In terms of tricks, I can't say there are any real "tricks."  You have to have a desire to stop drinking.  Every time you want to drink think about what happened before when you drank.  This will happen again -- no two ways around it.  Your life will be the same as it was before, even if you have one drink.  If that's not enough motivation for you, think of the people you have affected and whether you want to cause them more pain.  If you have a close friend or family member, I would suggest telling them what you're going through (though they probably have a good idea anyways), and explain that you want their support.  When you feel like you need a drink, call them up and ask to go over there or if they'll come to you and just talk through the situation.  Having someone like that is a big help.    Hope this helps, and best of luck.|`|sLgI3cRpaa	just dont drink|`|EVX17AjRaa	You can go to AA or get in a program.

You need to talk to someone when you feel like having a drink. There are hotlines you can call. Also you could take a walk or make yourself a cup of tea. Remember that the drink will only make your problem worse. Keep telling yourself you are worth more than that. You are a good person and you deserve to be happy. Good luck!|`|AA10741561	join a support group or find someone to talk to.|`|xrRZeROmaa	It's not a trick, it is a deliberate step.  go visit one meeting at AA, and get some peer help.

You can put eggplant on the pie or even make a cheese pie (no sauce) and put salad and dressing on top of that after the pie is cooled to room temperature.|`|gny47DLUaa	on top of pizza?  you can always use oilive oil mixed with things such as garlic, herbs, etc...  you can use a creamy white sauce, or make a cheesy sauce.  also, get creative. maybe he likes pesto (maybe not a two year old!)...?  i've used hummus before. basically anything that will not dry out/burn and will keep the crust pretty moist (and help keep the toppings on) should work.  good luck.

Chorizo & Tomato Omelette    extra virgin olive oil  1 small chorizo sausage, sliced  1 ripe tomato, deseeded and sliced  2 small sprigs fresh marjoram or parsley  3 eggs  1/2 fresh red chili, sliced  salt and black pepper  1 spring onion, finely sliced    Heat olive oil in small frying pan, add chorizo and fry for a minute before adding tomato and marjoram or parsley. Whisk the eggs in a small bowl, add the chili, season with salt and pepper and pour into the pan with the chorizo and tomato. Using a fork, mix the eggs around in the pan a bit and throw in the spring onion. Continue to fry until the eggs set, giving you a lovely little omelette    You only need:        * About 500g potato      * About 200g onion      * 6 large eggs      * 1 tsp salt    The Pan and Plate:        * Size (of pan) is important - I use a 24cm pan for this size of tortilla      * Youll also need a flat plate a little wider than the pan, so that you can turn the pan (with the tortilla in it) onto the plate    The Steps:        * Peel the potatoes and slice very thinly. Place the sliced potatoes in water until youre ready to use them.      * Slice the onions thinly.      * Heat some olive oil in a pan.      * Add the onions, stir and fry over a medium heat for about 5 minutes until they start to get soft.      * Drain the potatoes, pat them dry and add to the onions.      * Lower the heat, then stir and fry for 20-25 minutes or until the potatoes are tender, adding some more olive oil if the mixture is sticking. Once the potatoes begin to soften a little (after about 10 minutes), you can start to break up the slices as you stir.      * In a large bowl, whisk the eggs. Add the salt and the cooked onion and potato mixture to the bowl. Stir to mix. The heat of the cooked mixture will start to cook the eggs.      * Now put some more olive oil into the pan and pour in the egg mixture.      * Cook over a medium heat for about 7 minutes or until the tortilla appears fairly solid right through and there is little or no liquid egg on the surface of the tortilla.      * At this point, if youre feeling confident, you can cook the other side of the tortilla by placing the plate on top of the pan, turning the plate and pan over, and then sliding the tortilla gently back into the pan for 3-4 minutes. Alternatively, you can place the pan until the grill for 5-6 minutes to finish cooking the top that way and then turn it onto the plate when ready.|`|AA11403695	i put spaghetti in it and make it italian like with sausage and pesto etc. (and some veggies too)

Boil up a pound of pasta (whatever you have on hand, since we're  not talking sauce here, so shape doesn't really matter) until it's al dente.  Shock the pasta, drain it, and top with the garlic-infused, pan sauteed  veggies.  Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes to taste.

IY3XBGcGaa	tapioca. <br>  <br>  Tapioca is a flavorless, colorless, odorless starch extracted from the root of the plant species Manihot esculenta. This species, native to South America, is now cultivated worldwide and has many names, including cassava, bitter-cassava, manioc, "mandioca", "aipim", "macaxeira", "manioca", "boba", "yuca" (not to be confused with yucca), "Sabudana" and "kappa". Tapioca is a staple food in some regions and is used worldwide as a thickening agent, principally in foods. Tapioca is gluten free, and nearly protein free. The commercial form of tapioca most familiar to many people is pearl tapioca.<br>  <br>  The name tapioca is a word derived from tipi'óka, the name for this starch in Tupi This Tupi word refers to the process by which the starch is made edible. However, as the word moved out of South America it came to refer to similar preparations made with other esculents. 'Tapioca' in Britain often refers to a rice pudding thickened with arrowroot, while in Asia the sap of the sago palm is often part of its preparation.<br>  <br>  Pearl tapioca is similar to pearl sago, which is used in essentially the same ways. Consequently, tapioca may be called sago, and vice versa.|`|iOxzOwxaaa	its just tapioca pudding. its supposed to be like that :D|`|1A7PfZd4aa	You might be eating Tapioca Pudding...in which case those beads would be the Tapioca|`|AA11402528	tapioca|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Vanilla beans?|`|AA10625089	Tapioca

Separate rings; soak in milk for 15 minutes.     Meanwhile, mix cornmeal, flour, salt, pepper, melted shortening, egg, and 1 2/3 cups milk to make the batter.  Drain onion rings; dip in batter then in flour. Fry onion rings in batches in oil at 370 to 375 for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown.       Baked Onion Rings    Ingredients  1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs or panko breadcrumbs  1/2 teaspoon dried oregano   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper   2 medium onions, cut cross ways into  rings   2 tablespoons 1% low-fat milk   1/2 teaspoon salt   pepper       Directions  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.   Spray a cookie sheet with lite olive oil or other veggie oil.     Mix bread crumbs, oregano & cayenne (mix these ingredients on a sheet of wax paper it will make the next step easier).     Dip onion rings into the milk and allow the excess to drip back into the bowl.   Dip into the crumb mixture.   They won't be fully coated, don't worry they will still have a crunch (especially with Panko crumbs).     Place onion rings in a single layer on the cookie sheet.   Bake onion rings until the crumbs are golden and the onions are soft approx 30 minutes.     Sprinkle with salt & pepper and then serve.|`|yfgT9a3Taa	Back in my teen years i work at Sonic Drive In, to make the onion rings there we sliced the onions, add them to ice water for 30min-1 hr, then dip them in cold melted vanilla ice cream, then in plain corn meal, then in melted ice cream, then in corn meal.

Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).     2. Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.     3. Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.     4. Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain.

Combine the buttermilk, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Add the onion rings, toss well, and allow to marinate for at least 15 minutes. (The onion rings can sit in the buttermilk for a few hours.) In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Set aside.     When you're ready to fry the onion rings, preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels.     Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a large pot or Dutch oven. (A candy thermometer attached to the side of the pot will help you maintain the proper temperature.) Working in batches, lift some onions out of the buttermilk and dredge them in the flour mixture. Drop into the hot oil and fry for 2 minutes, until golden brown, turning them once with tongs. Don't crowd them! Place the finished onion rings on the baking sheet, sprinkle liberally with salt, and keep them warm in the oven while you fry the next batch.

uap6JAqQaa	unfortunately, it's generally considered very unhealthy - on par with stuff like alfredo and mac and cheese. it's extremely high in fat and calories, without much protein or veggies to compensate for all the carbs and fat. in short, yes, it would be considered detrimental to most any diet.    (sorry to be harsh - i'm not saying you can't eat it, because it's delicious and one of my favorite foods! but there's pretty much nothing about it that would be appropriate for a weight loss regimen.)|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Um - save this one for a treat.  most carbonara contains cream, eggs, bacon and cheese served up on pasta.

Well.....  in moderation with fresh fruits and/or vegs as a side dish. There is nothing wrong with 'diet,' but one needs to establish whether or not one can control certain factors.      Do not live to eat: but instead, eat to live.

The first eats dairy products and eggs, but no flesh. Vegan doesn't eat dairy or eggs.<br>  Also, if you are going to be a true vegetarian, you can not eat fish or chicken either. <br>  Do not worry about protein deficiencies. They are very rare. Most veggies have at least 20% of their calories from protein. Other excellent sources of protein include beans/lentils/nuts/grains/soy.<br>  Check out your local food co-op of you have one, or even Walmart. They always have tons of vegetarian dishes that are pre-made if you like that sort of thing. Things like frozen veggie burgers are excellent.<br>  Also, get a good vegetarian cook book to give you ideas.|`|1zNfZEDdaa	I'm the oldest of 9 kids. All biological, and from the same parents who are still together (So untypical i know!) But I just recently went vegetarian (I'm 16) And my mom is VERY supportive. Of course she has to cook for the rest of the family, and my dad is the typical meat eating guy, so when she makes meals that have meat I just cook something else. Or when I do cook myself food I make doubles or triples and save it for another meal when she makes a meat dish. <br>  I eat lots of fruits and put veggies in with my pasta or rice etc all the time. I eat whole wheat breads (My family is pretty health conscious so my mom makes whole wheat bread anyways, but she still buys some white flour products for easy meals bc of the big family, which I usually skip because I prefer not to eat white flour products.)<br>  And for breakfasts I make myself whole wheat banana bread with some semi sweet chocolate chips in it, it'll last me a while if the kids don't eat it. I usually top it with lowfat vanilla flavored yogurt and fruit. For lunch eat rice, or pasta with veggies. Dinner same thing, or eat what they're having as long as it isn't meat!!! Like cheese filled ravioli, or cheese pizza if it's just one of those nights. Try hard to stick to whole grains though! And for snacks do nuts and berries or trail mix. I don't really eat cheese, butter, milk or eggs unless it's on top of a casserole or baked into foods so I don't worry about it. But I don't not eat it ... I just don't find myself eating it often.<br>  <br>  This should help!

PhPOLgHGaa	well its a mix of things ...    it all depends first off on the type of restaunt and what the "owner" wishes to serve there.    the chef of course prepare it the way the owner wants, BUT he too of course can tell the owner different ways to try thing and offer several differnt suggestions for a particular meal that is on the menu...and also offer "specials" for say one day a week....that woudnt normally be on the menu.    the key ppl in the kitchen all play part as well, in giving a little idea/tip here an there too. it is all taken into consideraion.    having worked as a caterer, and in the kitchen of a prominant italian restaurant around here.    ~et~|`|XHnpraaxaa	Not sure if I understand your question.  Chefs are in charge of the kitchen and would be in over the other cooks and would be responsible to make sure the stock is in.  The owner would have responsible like making sure the menu is what brings in customers and that his staff was doing their jobs.|`|4de3da5babb437b65a9e55c075cdbbdeaa	I've worked in both situations.  A head chef that designs his own menu and says this is how I want it made.  And another couple who have said "This is what we have on hand, give me your ideas."  Basically the head chef makes the menus, but as the seasons change, they should ask for input from their employees.  So there are ones who are stuck in stone and ones who actually value input.
YQTBQ5xyaa	Depends.  Some restaurants don't change the menu much.  If you get hired on at an existing restaurant, there probably won't be too many recipe changes (for awhile, anyway).      In most cases, the chef comes up with daily specials and soups from scratch.  At most places I've worked, there might be 1 or 2 specials for lunch and dinner and maybe 2 or 3 different types of soups and maybe a couple of dessert specials.The chef will be expected to make these items without recipes and have them ready by service time.    A chef is expected to do menu development, write standardized recipes and perform menu cost analysis as needed.  Places that have set menus may only do this once or twice a year.   Restaurants with seasonal menus do this about 4 times a year.  Other restaurants change their menus once a week or daily.  Just depends.|`|I40vnqNyaa	Yes you would.  :)|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Yeah.. that's what a chef does..|`|c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	Not necessarily. Many restaurants feature classic recipes. It is the job of the head chef to decide what will be on the menu. He supervises the kitchen. Sometimes a Sous Chef comes up with a recipe or variation that the Head Chef will include on the menu.|`|AA10928232	Yes, assuming the restaurant was a new start-up.  If a new head chef walked in the door, they would probalby keep gong w/ what they had until she could make positive changes where needed most.|`|vvoz2jeyaa	i have managed several restaurant kitchens and also been head chef in others. most restaurants already have a menu with items that already have recipes. But, many times you are expected to come up with a special with a recipe  to serve on certain days, holidays, etc.

6tOK3STZaa	i would add a little honey at a time until it tastes normal.  the honey should take down the vinegariness (is that a word?) a bit.  you could also try a drop or two of sesame oil, but be careful its really strongggg.|`|AA10928232	Sounds like you need something to hold it all together when it's shaken or stirred: an emulsifier.  You can use an egg yolk, a tsp or two of dijon mustard, a tsp of dry mustard, or even a tsp or two of mayonnaise.  None of these are high in sodium.  Shake or whisk well until creamy and smooth.    Add your regular amt of oil back, then add one of the emulsifiers above.  It will help keep the oil and vinegar mixed together, in suspension, at least long enough to get it on your salad!|`|Ekd5HstEaa	I would add a little white sugar. :)|`|768111555ea193cbaa27a5b9ff4a2dbcaa	Maybe try putting a bit sugar in the dressing- might help to neturalise the vinegar.

eWWwepBvaa	Prime Rib Pasta:  Ingredients  2 tablespoons of Cajun Blackening spice (to give it a kick)  1 1/2 to 2 pounds prime rib, cooked as you prefer  1/2 cup (1 stick) butter   1 medium onion, minced   4 medium mushrooms  8-10 slices of bacon  6-8 pieces of asparagus  1/2 cup all-purpose flour   1 cup hot chicken broth   1/2 cup grated Parmesan   2 tablespoons olive oil   1 cup (about 8 ounces) sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil or if de-hydrated soaked in   warm water, chopped   1 pound dried ziti pasta   Salt   Freshly ground black pepper     Directions  Rub Cajun spice into the surface of the meat. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit while you prepare the sauce and pasta. (The rub will actually begin to "cure" the meat.)     For the sauce, melt butter in a large saucepan which will be large enough to accommodate the pound of cooked pasta, and saute onion until it becomes translucent. Mix in the flour to make a roux. Gradually add chicken broth and allow thickening. Remove from heat and whisk in Parmesan. Immediately cover surface of sauce with a sheet of plastic wrap and set aside briefly.     Bring a pot of water to boil for the pasta.     Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet. Cook the sun-dried tomatoes for a few minutes, then with a slotted spoon transfer them to the cheese sauce and whisk in. Cover the pot of sauce and set aside. Reserve the skillet and all the bits in it for the meat.     Boil the pasta until al dente and drain. Add the cooked pasta to the saute pan containing the sauce and fold to coat pasta. Season with salt and pepper, as needed. Keep covered in a warm place while you cook the steak.      Over medium high heat, sear the steaks and cook to your liking. Slice steaks into bite sized pieces and serve over pasta. You can either cook the veggies (mushrooms and asparagus) with the steak or seperately. In a seperate pan, while cooking the steak, crisp your bacon.       Cajun Horseradish Sauce;  4 tb Horseradish  1 tb Vinegar    1 c Sour Cream or Heavy Cream    2 ts Sugar    1 1/2 ts Dry Mustard    1/4 ts White Pepper      Instructions:  Heat all ingredients in a saucepan. Blend well, using a whisk. Immediately upon simmer; remove from heat.      Hope this tastes similar :) Enjoy!!!
hLeom7nLaa	If you're only making 1 or 2 pieces of chicken (breasts, thighs, whatever) I would say about  1 -2 tablespoons soy sauce  1 - 1 1/2 tablespoons teryaki  2 tablespoons olive oil  1 - 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder  Mixing up the items you said you'd like to use    One of my favorite marinades (that's really easy) is  (for about 2 chicken breasts)  2 tablespoons olive oil  1/2 teaspoon dried basil  1/4 teaspoon ground thyme  1/2 tablespoon garlic powder (onion is also good)  Salt (to taste)  Pepper (to taste)    Mix that up and put it on, its so tasty :)|`|yXno8yIkaa	Rub olive oil on the chicken, then sprinkle a bit of garlic powder and some pepper. Just use a teaspoon of soy, its pretty salty, and a few tablespoons of teryaki.    I also like oil, then chili powder, cumin,  cayanne, garlic powder and pepper for a spicy chicken breast.|`|MwkR695Gaa	well we always us itailian dressing. i know it sounds wierd but its really good. NOT creamy italian. it should be an amber color or whatever and ther should be like red things in it. marinate chicken breasts in it for atleast two hours. the longet the better though. jsut take the chicken our of the marinate and grill!!!!!!!!!!!!
xrRZeROmaa	every answer you've received will work.  The only suggestion left out is using an egg wash instead.  You can substitute one egg, scrambled into either water or milk, or a combination thereof.  The idea of the buttermilk in fried chicken recipes, is to make the breading stick to the chicken.  An egg wash will do the same thing.  A bound breading is made by dusting the chicken with flour to dry it out, then dipping it into a liquid, buttermilk, milk, buttermilk substitute, egg wash,....etc...., and re-dipping it into the flour, or cracker crumbs.  This process makes the breading stick to the chicken during the deep frying process.|`|AA12336927	Answerer 1 is correct, you could use sour cream as well for some things, but I use buttermilk ( or as close as possible) for fried chicken|`|h6NqNzHAaa	You can use cream and get really good results.|`|civJQaEkaa	all you have to do to make buttermilk is to add vinegar or lemon juice. just add one tbsp of vinegar or lemon juice to one cup of milk. mix and let stand 5 to 10 mins. i use this method myself and it works just fine.|`|AA10928232	Use salt water instead of buttermilk.  The point is to "brine" the chicken so it becomes moist and tender.  It's not the dairy, it's the sodium/acid that does it in the buttermilk recipe.  But the salt water soak is great, too.      Our Best Southern Fried Chicken      3 quarts water   1 tablespoon salt   1 (2- to 2 1/2-pound) broiler-fryer, cut up   1 teaspoon salt   1 teaspoon pepper   1 cup all-purpose flour   2 cups vegetable oil   1/4 cup bacon drippings     Combine water and 1 tablespoon salt in a large bowl; add chicken. Cover and chill 8 hours. Drain chicken; rinse with cold water, and pat dry.    Combine 1 teaspoon salt and pepper; sprinkle half of pepper mixture evenly over chicken. Combine remaining pepper mixture and flour in a large freezer bag. Place 2 pieces of chicken in bag; seal. Shake to evenly coat. Remove chicken, and repeat procedure with remaining chicken, 2 pieces at a time.    Combine vegetable oil and bacon drippings in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet or chicken fryer; heat to 360. Add chicken, a few pieces at a time, skin side down. Cover and cook 6 minutes; uncover and cook 9 minutes.    Turn chicken pieces; cover and cook 6 minutes. Uncover and cook 5 to 9 minutes, turning pieces during the last 3 minutes for even browning, if necessary. Drain on paper towels.    Note: For best results, keep the oil temperature between 300 to 325 as you fry the chicken. Also, you may substitute 2 cups buttermilk for the saltwater solution used to soak the chicken pieces. Proceed as directed.     Yield: Makes 4 servings    -- Southern Living|`|eAobNmUTaa	Cream will not servie the purpose of anything.  It is the acidity in the buttermilk that tenderizes the chicken.  Portugues is absolutely spot on, in making your own buttermilk with 1tbsp. of vinegar or lemon to one cup of milk.  Good luck!|`|177f5097fa1a3b3ea9e7b8f4fd6ff4a1aa	you could use cream or regular milk. it won't really affect the recipe that much. if you want to have the bitterness of buttermilk then warm a cup of milk in a bowl in the microwave for 40 seconds with a teaspoon of lemon juice... this will cause the milk to curdle... and can be used as a substitute to buttermilk.
CTybrL5kaa	Hello,  A six pound piece of meat is too large to be a single fillet. You probably have a trimmed tenderloin. Tenderloins are great pieces of meat because that can take just about any kind of dry heat, grilling, roasting, etc. Because the tenderloin is already such a tender piece of meat, smoking would only be done for flavor. I'd suggest smoking for a little while in a smoker before being finished as a roast. This'll give it a nice, dark outer apearence. Tenderloin cooks rather quickly though, so beware of time passed!  Tenderloin sliced into steaks can be grilled for great results, and the steaks from the narrower end become fillet. These steaks can be grilled or seared for lots of tender, juicy flavor.    Good luck and enjoy that tenderloin!|`|JZkCVHJAaa	http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/... america's test kitchen has always given me great recipes they test there recipes many ways to get the best out of it  you do have to pay for the online but you can pick up one of there cook books at a book store|`|8lYZROjuaa	Would you like to rephrase this question?    Just wanting to know since cooking over charcoal and smoking meat are two totally different things.|`|WbyFUQJbaa	This is from a good website, and I'm assuming you meant tenderloin not filet migon...that cut is small:    When I do a beef tenderloin like the one you're mentioning, I normally sear the outside of the roast on all sides and then roast in a 350 - 375 oven until the roast reaches an internal temperature of about 125 - 130 (which will give you a medium rare roast).   It's not always possible to tell you how long this will take as some roasts are thicker than others, but you will probably want it in for at least 45 minutes but perhaps even an hour.  It's very important to let the roast rest for AT LEAST fifteen minutes before you slice into it as the juices are still "settling". Similarly, the temperature of the roast will go up about 10 or 15 degrees in carryover cooking.  If you google things like roast beef tenderloin you'll get a ton of great recipes for this sort of roast as well. :)|`|mMnsplaqaa	You slice it into about 2" thick steaks, wrap a piece of bacon around each steak & secure the bacon with toothpicks & cook the steaks over real hot coals for about 2 or 3 minutes on each side for rare & longer for medium rare, etc.  No matter what I do with a fillet, it has to be wrapped in bacon & cooked over really Hot coals pretty quick, not smoked.  You can baste it with butter to get the flame on the coals going to char the outside of the steaks.

The big triangle corn chips are my favorite, but you can use any salty corn chip.    If I want them to be hearty, I open a can of re-fried beans and spread some on the chips, or drop spoonfuls onto chips laid out in a flat oven proof dish or pan.  Then sprinkle with salt, garlic powder and chili powder (optional/or to taste).  Next I use grated cheddar or thin slices of Velveeta, and sprinkle generously with sliced jalapenos.  Put in a hot oven till cheese melts.    I sometimes fix them for supper and fix a big flat bowl or large plate for each of us.|`|f84a503830fa54387d6c79c677ba67a3aa	one can of cheese whiz or velveeta mixed in with one can of chilli and a Tablespoon or two of Salsa.

q4ZkfG6Qaa	If you are worried about getting fat, you should just be drinking water. At college, to avoid the big "freshman 15" I stick to just drinking water, all day every day. No soda, nothing. Maybe try a different drink, though, everytime you go to starbucks...it might make your body a little sick of drinking so much coffee. It isn't necessarily unhealthy, but you could definitely go without it. Maybe just every other day? <br>  <br>  Edit: I forgot, it's EXPENSIVE! Cut it out and drink some water!|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Is shouldn't if you watch your calorie intake and output.

Y1Yzmsr0aa	All cheese actually starts white.  I have been to many cheese factors in the original Dairy state.  Not from where the cows are happy and give happy milk in California B.S.!!! Wisconsin is where real cheese comes from!!!       Cheese is died so it easier identified.  Cheese is also identified by the shape and size of log, wheel, or brick that it is originally formed in.      So all in all cheese starts white.      I don't want to sound arrogant but I reviewed the other answers given and the first two state that milk is made rotten milk.  That is certainly not the case, rotten means unedible.  The milk starts out fresh and enzymes are added to the milk (different enzymes to make different cheeses).  All this is done in a controlled enviornment and what happens is the milk then curdles and the curd it skimmed off the top (where cheese curds come from), and left behind is a slurry of milk fat and proteins.  This mixture is then churned very slowly for x amount of days until it is ready to be shaped, and sometimes coated in wax for an air tight ageing process.  This is the only way cheese is made legally for retail sail.      Hope this answers your question.    P.S.  Real cheese comes from Wisconsin.|`|bb9ff25058e1045a26f7c8f50513f852aa	no no no, cheese comes in many different colours, from, white,yelow,orange,red,white,and blue cheese, they do not make cheese from rotten milk, think how many people would fall ill, and cheese is amazing i love it. mhmm some cheeses are left for a long long long time before they can be eaten to theit best quality though. like 10-20 years but it's safe to eat =)|`|be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	I'd say some are made from rotten milk.  NOt entirely sure, but i'm fairly confident cheese is already "bad."  I know some cheese is made from maggot droppings/secretion...something....they make the cheese then let maggots eat it  and they give the cheese a "better" flavor.  But yeah, rotten stuff only is bad depending waht bacteria/fungus is eating it.
