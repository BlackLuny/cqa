20090226100645AAJDKVW	Consumer Electronics;TiVO & DVRs	Streaming Nextflix through TiVo--subscription required?	Obviously, I know that I will need a Netflix subscription. My question is: will I still have to pay the monthly TiVo subscription fee if I only want to use the box to stream Netflix movies, and not cable?      I'm pondering getting rid of my cable service, and just using Netflix and iTunes (via I-TV) to buy the content I want, since (like most people) I probably watch 2% of the crap that my cable company streams to me.      I'm aware that there is a Netflix-only box, but I already own a Tivo. If I can use it for this purpose, I'll keep the Tivo box. If I have to keep subscribing to Tivo, howerver, it would be more economical in the long-term to buy the Netflix-only box for $100.      Thanks in advance!

If you have a number in which I can call where I can talk to an actual person, that would be lovely. Thank you!!

I'm thinking about getting a new LCD TV, and I have many questions. If the answer to a question is obvious to you, please don't give me crap.       1. Are all LCD TVs that are sold in stores HDTV's      2. Does standard definition channels look worse or blurrier on SD LCD and/or HD LCD ?      3. If I have HD channels accessible, are all the channels going to be in HD, even though they weren't before?      4. Do HD channels blur too on HDTV, or just on the SD channels?      5. Will playing ps2 on SD LCD look worse or blurrier? What about on HD LCD?      6. Will playing xbox 360 on SD LCD look any blurrier or worse? Does it look better or worse on HD LCD, and does it look blurry at all on HD LCD?       7. At the stores when I look at the LCD TVs they have on display, some look blurrier than my old TV. How can I make it sharper, or make the blur go away? Do I adjust settings, or what do I do so that there's no blur.       8. What specifications do you recommend for the new LCD TV?

I've tried sending it with the song in MP4 and AAC but both times the T303 cannot receive it and it says 'File type not supported by phone'. What format does it have to be in for the T303 to support it?   Thanks
