WZdEdgxwaa	In a case such as this I refuse to quote a flat rate.I figure it's time on job and a royal pain.There are not set tables as to what to charge,each job is different.<br>  <br>  For me it's simple,I figure $25 per man hour.If he is just doing this part time or learning the trade that's different.Then I would say entry level pay $10-$15 an hour (get cash).I have done way to many jobs like this and the owners change there minds,there choice.<br>  <br>  I kinda figure just work till either there money runs out or the job is done.Few really understand what it takes to restore a home to pristine conditions.<br>  <br>  My Best|`|150FyTAuaa	Here in SC they charge $4-$5 per foot, 2000 sq ft home would be 8-10 thousand.|`|6Hj0h5BYaa	An old victorian style house with lots of detailed woodwork... it's hard to say without seeing the house and knowing exactly what is going to be done in the job. But a professional painter would surely charge thousands for the whole job. Charging by square foot in painting is something I never advised. Because one square foot is an empty ceiling, but another square foot has tons of detailed trim that needs to be considered. Give a quote for the entire job, or at least room by room. Based off the small amount of info, I'd probaby charge around a thousand per average-sized room. Maybe about 650 for a bathroom. This would be for one color on the ceiling, one color on the wall, and one color on the woodwork. If the woodwork is very fancy, it will probably cost more. Drywall repairs....more. Wallpaper removal....way more.<br>  <br>  Also, and please don't take this as rude, because I don't mean it that way. I am only being honest.... if your husband is not a professional painter, then he should not consider charging ANYWHERE near what a pro painter would charge for this job. The only reason someone would hire a non-pro is if it will cost a lot less. Perhaps your husband has painted many houses but never for business purposes.... then I can see charging close to what the pros would charge. <br>  <br>  It just sounds like a pretty high-scale paint job that should probably be done by a pro. Homeowners and other people get the impression that anyone can paint a house, this idea leads to disastrous paint jobs and angry customers not wanting to pay. However, if your husband can surely do a fantastic job, then he should get a fair price for it. $2.00 per square foot in an average 8x10x8  room would equal 800 dollars. So I guess I would suggest between 2 and 3 dollars per square foot. If he is competing with other people who are giving price quotes, say between 1.50 and 2.00.

Now, the carpet was not bubblegum pink (you're parents shoulda put their foot down on that one haha) but the colors in the room were of course her favorite, bubblegum pink, soft blue (not pastel though), and a soft green tone (it had neither too much yellow or blue in the green) along with white trim. The bedspread pulled all the colors together because it's the biggest plane in the room that's fabric, so it's the best place to do that, unless you add a rug, then you can almost ignore the pink in the rug and pull it into pillows somehow and use the wall tones and bedspread colors to shine in the rug. Also, a solid chair helps out in the room if it will fit. Maybe some white accessories with touches of the blue and green will work. Another route you can go is a soft orange tone with sprigs of the pink just so it doesn't look like you're ignoring it, along with white. I have a great example for you to check out. Candice Olson from Divine Design on HGTV recently did a young girl's room in orange, pink and white. She used a white based wallpaper with an outlined, small graphic floral on it in orange and pink tones (bright) on the pattern she embelished it with those jewels you can buy at a craft store. By no means did it look crafty, it looked fresh and classy. She then pulled the tones into the bed spread. A solid spread with patterned pillows can mute it down. I think you'll be able to find some great accessories being that it's spring now. Pier one has some awesome peonies in pinks and whites already in vases. Faux flowers could make it look great.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Whatever you intend to do with the area, you'll have to remove the roots of the grass, because the weedkiller won't magically dissolve them and you wouldn't be able to plant anything or lay paving etc on top of them. I think the best instant solution would be to hire a turf cutter for the weekend and simply slice it off. This is very satisfying and easy and you'll finish up with a nice flat surface. Then, if you have a compost heap, stack the turf upside down in layers and you'll get some good topsoil in a few months. Or if you want rid of it, take it to the recycling centre and put it in the soil and rubble skip.|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	Boiling  Salt Water.

Russian vine is the fastest to take off, (trailing white flowers and attractive foliage)  but you could also plant honeysuckle, (you can get both early-flowering ones and those which flower later in summer) or  clematis Bill McKenzie (lots of small yellow flowers, end of summer) or clematis Montana (the early-flowering type, several lovely pink or white cultivars, double or single) -both of these clematis are vigorous and hardy. You might also consider a rambler rose - have a look at the website for David Austin Roses for a good range to choodse from. . Fix Netlon plastic mesh to your fence to train the climbers up as they grow, keep them well fed and watered and they'll soon camouflage the ugly shed. You might even end up with a nicer view than you had before you needed to solve the problem! <br>  <br>  Of course you could tackle the bindweed- it's not too bad once you've got it under control. Before you plant anything, give the ground a really good deep digging all over, with a fork not a spade, and carefully remove every trace of root that you can find. Then do this again and you'll find some of what you missed the first time! When you've really done your best with it, just be vigilant and remove any new shoots as soon as you see them. Probably these won't be as deep as the first lot as they'll just be bits you've missed. Spray along the boundary to your neighbour's fence when it starts emerging along there. Then you can plant in your ground and not have the bother of watering pots.

OwCUYWeUaa	The main difference between r-22 (hcfc) and r-134a (hfc) is the absence of chlorine.  Chlorine is the element that reacts with the ozone layer, so all cfc and hcfc refrigerants will eventually be replaced with hfc refrigerants.  R-12 (cfc), which was used in automobile a/c systems, has not been manufactured for about 15 years.  It is still available, but very expensive.  Automobile a/c systems now use r-134a.  Old r-12 systems can be retrofitted to use r-134a.  Residential and commercial a/c systems use r-22. New units that use r-22 will no longer me manufactured after 2010, but R-22 refrigerant will still be manufactured until 2020, although the price is rising every year.  The new refrigerant used in residential and commercial a/c systems is called r-410a (hfc).  You may see it advertised as "Puron".  You CANNOT retrofit a r-22 system to work with r-410a.  It would require a complete system change out.|`|AA11652304	R 22 is a CFM (Chloroflouromethane) and the 3rd atom of oxygen in ozone(O3) combines with the Chlorine in CFM to make ordinary oxygen (O2) thus depleting the ozone.<br>  <br>  R 134a is an HFC (Hydroflourocarbon) and does not combine with atmospheric ozone.<br>  <br>  Older systems can be retro fitted for the new gas but it is expensive. There are refrigerants available that will work in older systems that are not ozone depleting.

AKrTZqbKaa	A lot of people do not lime their soil to get the Ph up to around neutral (6.5 to 7.0) If your soil isn't in this range any fertilizer you apply gets locked up in the soil and the grass doesn't get any fertilizer. Acidic soils take in the nutrients from the fertilizer and locks them up so the plant starves. Liming a soil is an important step. Some lime takes months to break down so do it in the fall. There is a fast acting lime but a little more expensive.  Scotts is a little expensive and there are a lot of cheaper brands that will do the same. Just read the numbers on the back of the bag and get them around the same. If you don't lime your throwing money into the ground without any benefits. Here in the Northeast we use products made by M.N.A (Mass Nursery Association) which is cheaper and just as good. Visit a local nursery that displays the MNA logo.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Use a $6 bag of Ammonium Sulfate to green things up, then use a pre-emergent + fertilizer to prevent spring weeds (clovers, dandelions, crabgrass).<br>  <br>  Scotts is over-rated- and only exists as a homeowner product specialist.

It has proved to be a winner all over the country.... You can match Scotts products with other brands to try to save money, but the end result will not justify the savings. Get your soil PH tested, it may show a need to change your fertilizing practice if your lawn appears to have changed its appearance over the years.Don't lime your lawn or anything else for that matter, till you have your PH tested and it needs it. You could just be making things worse.|`|zM9Lj21waa	i use a mulching mower and dont need any other fertilizer...|`|UqM22AZRaa	scotts is about the best, though rather expensive

AA12139345	Well, there's a lot of information missing in your question...<br>  Like what size wire is supplying the power, and how far away the shed is -- and even whether the supply is buried or not, which will mandate which kind of wire you can use.

Example would be installing a Velux window or dormer. However you DO need building control approval. The Building control department have nothing to do with the planning department and are completely separate. They are not interested in how things look or how they impact on other people they are only there to enforce THE BUILDING REGULATIONS which are ultimately enforced in England and Wales by DCLG but in your nation it will be another body. The stairs must not have a pitch of more than 34 degrees. The going (the horizontal length of each step) must not be  less than 250mm (10 inches approx) and the rise (the height of each step) must not be less than 100mm or more than 170mm. You can buy CAD software  to work this out or you can use a lot of paper and candle wax but I would not recommend going ahead without speaking to a chartered building surveyor; a chartered structural engineer or an architect. In addition, if you are going above 2 storeys you will need to create an isolated fire lobby or use 30 minute fire doors with self closing devices and smoke excluders.

AA10864970	Prevention <br>  Sanitation is important but not entirely effective in reducing populations because insects often reside between wall partitions, in insulation materials, in books and papers, among book shelves and in other protected places. However, be sure to remove old stacks of newspapers, magazines, papers, books and fabrics plus foodstuffs spilled and stored for long periods of time. Often reducing available water and lowering the home's relative humidity with dehumidifiers and fans is helpful. Repair leaking plumbing and eliminate moisture around laundry areas. Lighting a dark, sheltered area may force these insects to move to new sites where they can be controlled more easily. Once the infestation has been eliminated, sanitation will help prevent reinfestation. <br>  <br>  Insecticides <br>  Treatments for silverfish control need to be applied thoroughly to all potential hiding places such as cracks, crevices, inside floor moldings, around steam and water pipes, in and behind seldom moved furniture, closets and even attics. It may be necessary to drill small holes in the walls to treat large populations in wall voids. ECO PCO DUST is perfect for these treatments. Silverfish control may not be immediate since bristletails in wall voids must move out and contact the insecticides. It may take 10 to 14 days. There are many insecticides labeled for control of silverfish and firebrats (bristletails). Silverfish Place Paks are new and simple for the homeowner.   Residual sprays like ECO PCO Insecticide Space spray Total Release bombs like pyrethrins are effective in places where sprays are hard to reach such as in crawl spaces and attics. Before using any insecticide, always read the label, follow directions and safety precautions. It is advisable to use the services of a reputable, licensed pest control operator or applicator when infestations are persistent and hard to locate. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.critterridders.com/silverfishpaks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.critterridders.com/silverfish...</a>
oIRLs6Spaa	Thanks for saying that you water it only with rain water, because my first instinct was that you were watering it with bad water.  <br>  <br>  So, if water isn't the problem, then perhaps your plant is just in shock.  How long have you had it?  Has it been repotted recently?  Perhaps it was growing in a terrarium before you got it and now it's experiencing a shorter photoperiod, so it's going dormant.  Or perhaps before you got it, it was being watered with tap water and the minerals in the water have built up in the soil and are making the plant sick.  Or maybe you've been using fertilizer.  Fertilizer will kill the plant.<br>  <br>  In any case, it's hard to troubleshoot your plant's health with the bit of information given here.  You should join the forum on my site and describe your problem in more detail and maybe upload a photo of it for us to help you figure it out.

I'd probably feel more happy if my room was painted lime green.<br>  You should also add orange polka dots and pink polka dots. :)|`|REoNMbanaa	try purple and lime green they go great together!|`|6Hj0h5BYaa	I agree with the lime-green. That's a very popular color right now. It's refreshing and will make you feel happy every time you wake up! <br>  <br>  The important thing is to paint your ceiling white (and use flat paint). This will make the color in your walls stand out and your lighting will be most effective. If you have trim or mouldings, paint those glossy white. Your room will look very sharp, and these two colors will allow for a big variety of room decor that you may want to put in there.|`|RbCsBbhLaa	Well you could keep in mind when choosing colors that your walls will have to stay that way for a while so pick colors that you'll still like 5 years from now.

AA12139345	"Hob, canape, and washer" -- I take it this home isn't in the US, hehehe....<br>  <br>  First, you want to check with your local building authority to see if you need to pull permits for any of this work, and if you need to have a licensed pro sign off on it.  (Some pro's are willing to inspect your work and sign off on it, but many aren't, it may take some searching on your part to find one that will work with you).<br>  <br>  Plumbing -- do it right the first time.  Don't use any 'quick connect' fittings in hard to reach areas, or you'll regret it later, when they leak.  TEST the plumbing while it is easy to access.<br>  <br>  Electrical -- when in doubt call an electrician -- make a mistake with the plumbing, and you can get wet, make a mistake with the electrical, and someone can die.  On that cheerful note - here in the USA, appliances like the refrigerator, microwave, and washing machines MUST be on a dedicated circuit.  Here, that means a 20 amp circuit breaker, 12-2w/ground 'romex', and a 20 amp rated outlet.  Standard wiring can be 14 gauge here.  14 gauge is SMALLER than 12 gauge, and is only rated for 15 amps.<br>  Any outlets within 6 feet of a water source MUST be GFCI outlets, or run to a GFCI breaker.  I prefer to use the heavier 12 gauge wiring throughout all of my work for standard 110v wiring.  It costs a bit more, but it is safer.<br>  Don't overload any one circuit - plan ahead, and put in enough circuits and outlets to handle everything you think you might want to run.<br>  <br>  Cabinetry - Install the bottom units first (saves you from banging your head on the uppers, hehehe).  Level them with shims, and screw them to the wall, and to each other.  I like to use this little piece of hardware to bolt the countertops together, along a seam -<br>  <a href="http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?Offerings_ID=349&TabSelect=Details" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?Offer...</a><br>  I also like to cut a spline joint into the edge with a router, and glue a spline in place.  Between the spline and the 'titejoint' fasteners, it makes for a very strong joint.<br>  Where possible, use a router to cut any openings in the countertops, particularly if they are laminate.  I like to use a spiral router bit, with the spiral cutting into the laminate - no chip out.<br>  <br>  There's more to be said, but there is a text limit on these answers, hehehe.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
3d9oSUp6aa	Pedestal sinks come in two pieces—the stand (pedestal) and the sink itself. The plumbing fits inside the pedestal, which is secured to the floor. The sink is mounted to the wall and also rests on the pedestal stand. <br>  <br>  Before you decide to purchase, here are some things to think about: <br>  <br>  Installing one is a little more difficult than a regular drop-in or wall-mount lavatory. Fitting the plumbing inside the pedestal can be close work. Also, matching the sink to the proper level on the wall and the exact height of the pedestal requires precise measurements. <br>  <br>  Decide whether you can live without the storage space of a vanity cabinet. Remember, to make room for the new ped lav, the counter top and cabinet are going away. Shelving or recessed medicine cabinets can compensate for some lost cabinet space. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are removing an old vanity, the floor and wall will probably require some attention, and the water supply lines may have to be relocated<br>  <br>  As far as repairing the pipes is concerned I wouldn't worry too much as it isn't something that requires attention often. You should be able to go at least 10 years minimum before any maintenance is required unless there is an accident.|`|jr2yqSJqaa	I've had both and while pedestals look great, they lack the storage you need in a bathroom so I'd go with a vanity for sure.

0WdCa5gLaa	It depends on the type of paint, water based or oil based. <br>  <br>  If water based (acrylic) I would start out scrubbing with an old toothbrush dipped in liquid detergent, alternating with warm water. <br>  <br>  If oil based I'd probably try the above steps first then if that doesn't work, use a solvent type product such as Goof Off or Goo Gone on a Q-Tip then scrub with an old toothbrush with liquid detergent and warm water.

rsc0risnaa	Seed Starting Guide:<br>  <br>  Starting vegetable plants from seeds is not difficult, yet for beginners it can be intimidating. Try to under stand the basic needs of seeds, and then use common sense and follow a few simple rules; you too will be growing them like pros.<br>  Understanding what seeds need to germinate:<br>  (1) Moisture: Keep the soil moist, not soaking wet after sowing the seeds.<br>  (2) Air:When seeds germinate and root start to develop, they need air to breath and grow. The right kind of soil provides good drainage, which will allow the roots to develop properly.<br>  (3) Proper temperature: condition provided by you. The optimum germination temperature is between 75-80 F. Seeds will germinate outside of this range, but it may take longer.<br>  (4) Light: When seedling emerges, provide ample light will ensure healthy growth.<br>  Keys for growing healthy seedlings:<br>  (1) Use clean soil: Use store bought potting soil. They have the right kind of structure that will provide good drainage. They are sterile. Some even have fertilizer added to the soil mix (if not you can add your own). It will make your job much easier. Sometimes it is tempting to use old soil, but it will just cause trouble later on. Old soil is not sterile and can introduce diseases to the plants and cause them to die (damping off).<br>  (2) Use fresh seeds: Starting with good fresh seeds are important . Chose varieties that are adaptable for local growing condition. The vitality of seeds means the capacity to live, grow and develop. Vital seeds germinate faster and reduce the chances for mishaps to occur.<br>  (3) Direct sow or start from seeds? Certain seeds must be started in pots. This include the heat loving plants such as tomatoes, peppers and eggplants. Others should be direct sowed. This include root crops-radishes, carrots, greens like spinach. The rest it is up to you. You will usually get the plants to produce earlier if you start them as seedlings first.<br>  (4) The keep one rule: When starting seeds in pots, place several seeds in each seed pot. When the seedlings emerge, remove all but one strong and healthy seedling in each pot. This will ensure the proper development of the seedling and give your plant the best chance to survive.<br>  (5) Using heat mats: Heat mats raise the temperature about 10 F above the ambient temperature. Heat mats provide bottom heat and that is just what young seedlings love. Used properly you can grow some of the best looking, healthy seedlings. Temperature control unit: Used together with a heat mat, the temperature control unit allows you to set the heat mat at a constant temperature.<br>  (6) Mulching: Mulching the seedlings: add a layer of mulch such as chicken grits (fine rocks) can have many benefits to young seedlings: (a) it keeps the moisture in the soil (b) it prevents soil being splattered when watering (c) It reduces the chances of moss or fungus forming on the surface.<br>  (7) Direct sow guide: If you decided you are going to direct sow your seeds, do the following:<br>  (a) Prepare your garden by turning it over and make the soil fluffy. Add soil amendments if you need to. Soil amendments can be garden compost, manures, coconut fibers, peat moss or sand.<br>  (b) Make a furrow, place potting soil in the furrow. Sprinkle some slow release fertilizer in the furrow.<br>  (c) Sow at the appropriate spacing, and cover the seeds with a light layer of soil and water the seeds well.<br>  (d)  If weather is still cold and wet, consider covering the site with a plastic sheet.<br>  (8) Transplanting to garden: When seedlings grow to certain size, you will need to transplant them to bigger pots or to the garden. Mix some slow release fertilizers (such as 16-16-16) in the soil whether when you transplant.<br>  Prepare your plants for transplanting: Set the plants you started indoors or in your greenhouse out during the day and bring them in at night for a few days just before you transplant them. This process is call hardening off.<br>  Be sure to space the plants properly. They may look small and have too much space at first; soon you will be glad you give each plant enough room to grow.|`|wKQbNvm9aa	Easiest thing is to buy one of those seed starting kits that comes with a plastic tray, some peat pellets, and a clear lid.  You wet the peat pellets, plant the seeds according to the instructions on the seed packet as to depth, and put on the lid.  Remove the lid when most of the seeds have sprouted.  Most seeds like to be very warm to sprout - at least 70 degrees.  Most seeds will sprout within a week - the seed packet should tell you this.  <br>  <br>  After the seeds sprout you will need grow lights or the long fluorescent bulbs to give the plants enough light.  Good luck!|`|i5rEUteRaa	I agree with the other folks but have an addition. I had great success using one of those kits but bought one that had a warming pad in it.

To keep it warm enough, I put it in a sunny window (this works well if you're trying to sprout seeds in the winter, but if your house is around 82 degrees or warmer, the sunny window is not necessary).  Check them every few days and when they sprout, plant them in moist soil.|`|pcEJMHPMaa	Buy a mini greenhouse kit and seed starter soil plant the seeds,water cover with plastic greenhouse cover and put in a window.

bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	I mentioned in an earlier answer for you that hard water crystals can form in the dielectric nipple (it's a tiny pipe leading from your water heater...about 1 inch in diameter and about 4 or 5 inches long.).  The dielectric nipple is designed to attract these crystals to prevent them from forming further down the line in your hot water pipes where it would be nearly impossible to cure later on.<br>  <br>  These crystals can clog the pipe so greatly that they restrict the amount of hot water that flows through it.  This won't reduce the temperature, but it will reduce the amount of hot water getting to your faucets...when that smaller-than-usual amount of hot water mixes with cold tap water, it gets even colder and it seems like the water just isn't as hot as it used to be.<br>  <br>  I found this out the hard way myself.  I also noticed the water temp seemed cooler than usual.  When we got to replace the part, it was so thoroughly clogged after only about 6 years of use that it hardly passed any water through it at all.<br>  <br>  THE CURE?<br>  Get a professional to change out your dielectric nipple on the water heater and you'll return to getting full flow.  The part costs about $6 and is available at any hardware store.  The service, however may run you around $35 to $80, depending on the company that does the work for you.  If you know a good handyman, he can usually do this for you in about 15 minutes and maybe charge you the cost of a beer!    d=)<br>  <br>  Incidentally, these days, alot of people are looking for extra work to make a few bucks here and there.  You could try asking someone from the Plumbing department at your hardware store if they would be willing to change this out for you at a lower cost, or you could also try posting an ad on Craigslist under "Gigs -- Labor".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites" rel="nofollow">http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites</a><br>  <br>  Either way, it's definitely less than the cost of a new water heater!<br>  <br>  The bottom right side of this page has a badly rusted photo of a dielectric nipple that's been clogged...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.waterheaterrescue.com/pages/WHRpages/English/Longevity/water-heater-maintenance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.waterheaterrescue.com/pages/W...</a><br>  <br>  That photo is a pretty extreme case.  Mine was a normal, non-rusted pipe, with a bunch of crystals inside it.|`|3ZEqPQ0faa	Find out how old the unit is, typically they need to be replaced after 20 years.  Also, depending on the "hardness" of your water, you should shut off and completely purge the unit.  Sediment tends to collect @ the btm. and on the heating coils and sometimes affect efficiency.  I would also check the supply lines to your shower,  there may be exposed copper that gets near freezing if it is not insulated.  They do make a unit, I think Bosch started it, that heats the water only as it is requested.  It is a wall mount unit and takes up little space.  I hope this helps.<br>  Doug|`|AKrTZqbKaa	Most showers are now equipped with an anti-scald control valve. This keeps the water in the shower from getting too hot. It could be malfunctioning and needs to be adjusted or replaced. The furnace should not turn the heat on if the hot water is being called for. Doe's the sink have real hot water? If so I would suspect the shower/bath control.

vEsSIGfYaa	I intend to cause no offense here, but it sounds like you don't know enough to safely do this job, even with answers from here.  Your "Here is my guess black to black" is "usually" correct.  The red to white is WRONG!  The green to white is WRONG!<br>  <br>  You really need a qualified electrician to examine how the wiring is connected INSIDE your tanning bed, and similarly analyze the wires in the wall.  For the wires in the wall, a Volt-Ohm meter should be used to:<br>  <br>  1.  Determine which wire(s) is/are "hot."<br>  2.  Which wire is the "neutral." <br>  3.  Which wire is the Grounding Conductor connected to the Ground Buss inside the Fuse Box or Circuit Breaker Panel.<br>  <br>  There is a standard "usual/normal" "Convention" for house wiring, but that doesn't mean that whoever installed your house wiring [in the wall] did it correctly.  IF that was done wrong, then there could be fatal damage to your tanning bed, a fire, or an electrocution.<br>  <br>  Now, that the warnings are in, here is the "almost" universal house wire color coding "Convention."<br>  <br>  Black is considered the "Hot" wire carrying the current "to" an appliance.<br>  White is considered the "Neutral" wire to complete the circuit by carrying the current "back to" the fuse box or Circuit Breaker panel.<br>  A green [or sometimes "bare," uninsulated] wire is used for a safety backup of the Neutral, and is called a "Grounding Conductor."<br>  Any other colors [in AC current] are used also for Hot wires, usually indicating 220-240 Volts.<br>  <br>  That combination coming out of your tanning bed "suggests" that it operates on 110-125 Volts AC [Alternating Current].<br>  <br>  The combination of Black, Red, and White in the wall suggests that that particular circuit is a 220-240 Volt circuit, and WILL DESTROY YOUR TANNING BED, and in the process create a whole lot of "fireworks," and maybe even a FIRE!!!!!<br>  <br>  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you get someone who KNOWS what they are doing to:<br>  <br>  1.  Analyze your tanning bed to determine for certain what each wire is for, regardless of color.<br>  2.  Analyze the house wiring you want to connect to, to be certain what its voltage is, and which color wire is which.|`|z0yyBvqlaa	I don't understand your setup. Normally, green and bare copper are the ground wires that connect to each other. White is neutral & only connects to white. Red & black are the hot wires that connect to black or red. I'd suggest getting the directions for your tanning bed. If you don't have them, you can go to Google.com and/or Yahoo.com, etc. and enter terms such as "tanning bed manual" or "tanning bed wiring" in the search field. You would need to find the manufacturer and model number first. They are probably attached with a sticker or on a plate somewhere out of sight. Good luck with this. Be careful, a mistake could prove to be serious.|`|AA11340957	Red is usually switched power.Check with voltmeter (or test light) to see it is NOT a 240 outlet.. Then once you know  whats hot and whats neutral and whats ground(you may need a separate gnd) hook it up(make sure you turn off power first(looking at the breaker will tell you whats going on)).|`|yaq7oaH6aa	PLEASE DON"T MAKE THE CONNECTIONS YOU "GUESS"<br>  You have 120/240 at the wall, and only need 120 for your tanning bed.<br>  Black and red from the walls are 'lines' , (240V. between them).<br>  Do NOT connect them together or to a white.<br>  The white from the wall is 'neutral' ( 120V to either 'line'.).<br>  From your tanning bed Black is 'line', white is 'neutral', <br>  green is ground.<br>  (You probably have a metallic box in your wall. that's your ground.)<br>  Now, What is the wire size at the wall and what is the load of your tanning bed?<br>  There will be a nameplate on the bed with load in watts and/or amperes <br>  and required circuit wire size etc.<br>  If the wire from the wall is #12 (it will be printed on the covering), <br>  and the bed needs a 20A circuit or less, you're good to go.<br>  If not, call some-one who knows what he's doing.<br>  Cap the 'line', (Red eg.),  that you will not be using with a wirenut, <br>  and fold it back into the box<br>  Buy and install a 120V grounding outlet in the box with <br>  'black' to brass screw, white' to silver screw, <br>  and a ground connection to the box.<br>  (If the outlet is listed as self grounding you can skip that part.<br>  Ask for one when you buy it.)<br>  Now install a plug on the cord from your tanning bed.<br>  (White goes to the slightly larger flat pin, black to the other flat pin, <br>  \and green to the longer rounded pin.)<br>  Plug it in and it is connected properly with the 'means of disconnect' required by Code.
59c3b42b981e8e7cddf9e38ed4ba42b6aa	Maple leaves change color in fall or in some cases early winter. Months? It varies from where you are. If you live in Northern Canada then it will be early on the season. If you live in the Southern United States then it will be later in the season. Sometimes it all depends how cold the season is. If we have a nice and warm fall, you might be seeing changes of the leaves in early winter.

gRWzLHVEaa	That is a great deal on a good quality sewing machine. I would recommend adding a seam ripper to your shopping list as well as spare needles for your sewing machines in various sizes as you will need to change the needles depending on the thickness of the material you are sewing. I should also tell you that the quality of thread you use is very important, dollar store thread sometimes is such poor quality that it is impossible to get the right tension... Also a fabric measuring tape, spare bobbins and I like to use chalk and a ruler to ensure you see a straight line. Hope that helps, good luck!!|`|E5gaKzCsaa	You'd be much better off to get a good quality used machine than to buy this one. It might cost more, maybe not much more, but should last much longer. In sewing machines, you get what you pay for. I have a Brother that I paid $200 for at Wal-mart 10 years ago. It needed repair about 5 years ago. I broke it mending jeans, and it's called a "denim machine". What a joke. I now only drag it out when I want some fancy stitching, which happens about 3 times a year. I also have a Kenmore that I paid $100 for 25 years ago. It has done all the same kind of sewing and lots more of it and hasn't needed any repairs yet. And while it's nice to think of all the fancy stitches this new one you're looking at has, in practice you're very unlikely to use more than straight and zig zag. I rarely do. <br>  <br>  Go to a store that sells and services sewing machines. They should have some older machines which were very good quality to start with, and the store will have tuned them up and made sure they're running properly, and they should offer a warranty and even classes if you want that. Older machines are more likely to be made of all metal and can be repaired. Cheap new ones have a lot of plastic parts and can become junk when they break. Don't let age scare you. I have a couple of machines 50 years old that can sew rings around newer cheaper models. <br>  <br>  Buy good thread, like Gutterman, Mettler, Coats. Cheap thread can gum up your machine faster than you can imagine.<br>  <br>  You'll need tailor scissors, buy the best you can afford. They'll last many years if you only cut fabric with them. Cut paper once with them and you'll notice they get dull. Buy a seam ripper, more bobbins, small scissors(these can be cheap), a selection of machine needles in different sizes, a tape measure, a clear ruler, perhaps a fabric marking pencil, some dressmaker's pins. That ought to get you started. Wal-mart is a great place to buy everything except the machine and maybe the tailor scissors, I haven't looked at their scissors lately . As you go along you'll see what else you need for the sewing you do.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	If you plan on making curtains and blankets, quilts, your going to need a heavy duty machine. Brother machines are good but I would spend more money on a better one.You don't need the most expensive one but you do want one in the middle price range, and one that also has alot of accessory's.You never know what you'll be trying to sew,and you want to make sure you have everything you need on the machine, I have a Singer and I spent around $400.00 on it. You might want to look at Sears, for your machine.
oIRLs6Spaa	Actually, at this point, you're better off not putting your plant into dormancy.  You should just find a sunny windowsill for your plant and leave it there until the chance for freezes is gone in the spring and then move it outside.<br>  <br>  Plan on doing dormancy next year.  Your plant will stay healthier if you give it sunlight during dormancy.  I keep my plants on an unheated, south-facing porch and that works great for them.  The idea is to simulate the weather they'd get in the wild, which is shorter days and cooler weather.  Under no circumstances would they receive no sunlight, but sometimes people don't have an option for how to put their plants into dormancy and that's how the fridge method came to be.<br>  <br>  In any case, if you have questions or concerns, you should join the forum on my website and ask them there:<br>  <a href="http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3/</a><br>  <br>  There are lots of very knowledgeable growers on the forum that are very friendly and helpful.

I believe Ortho markets one as Volck Oil Spray.  Anyway, it is commonly used as a pest control for trees by mixing it with  water and spraying it on the trunks and branches of trees, especially during the winter time, but it can be used year round.  If you put a tablespoon of this product into a pint spray bottle, and fill the rest with water, you can mist your houseplants with it.  It will make the leaves shiny and glossy.  It is not a pesticide in the usual sense, and it is safe to use in your home, etc.  Read the label.

tPGxPDvBaa	Too hot & dry air is probably your worst issue.  You shouldn't water until you can put a finger at least a 1" down & it is dry. Probably sitting on the floor is the better idea for now - cooler & no direct light. I don't think the sitting in water for additional moisture is helping.  The air around the plant needs to be more humid.  Having a humidifier would be a much better option for plant & you.
2NOWzXhUaa	There are usually a couple of ducts in the back of fridge freezers, and if one gets blocked with ice, the system doesn't work properly. Empty the unit and switch it off to let ALL ice melt, (you can speed up the process with a hairdryer but make sure you don't let it get wet).<br>  Also check the door seals are clean and intact, as you don't get ice buildup without moisture getting in.

d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	Gort . . . wash isn't texture, it's technique and color; being that you want black/grey I need to know how the door stands right now in order to competently walk you through the correct steps and technique to achieve this finish, i.e., is the door raw wood, clear coated, painted etc.<br>  <br>  If you get back to me on the above I'll help you with the finishing schedule to get exactly what it is you want.<br>  <br>   **Got your message.  OK, here's what you need to do -<br>  <br>  (1) Pick the color that you want from the paint department and then look next to or below that color and choose the next darker shade and get this mixed in a quart of flat paint.<br>  <br>  (2) With #220 sandpaper and a finishing sander sand the unfinished wood door on all planes until it has a smooth feel.  Dust with either a vacuum or compressed air and then tack cloth the door down to remove any remaining dust particles (nothings worse then debris in a finish).<br>  <br>  (3)  Now here's where I need to get with you for more detail if you want this to have a metal/industrial look.  Right now I'll assume you just want a straight wash.<br>  Cut the Quart of paint with a pint water to thin it; with a rag or sponge work it over the door; if it's not dark enough let the first application completely soak in and then re-apply until you get the color you want.  If the colors too dark, take a second damped sponge an systematically work from top to bottom or bottom to top, wiping the door down and effectively removing someof the color saturation, i.e. thinning out the color. In either case, the even application and distribution is key.  The differences in the grain densities and patterns will provide the washed appearance.<br>  <br>  (4)  Once the wash is applied and dry I apply a coat of sanding sealer as the moisture from the coating will lift the grain.  Now, be sure to use a waterborne sanding sealer because it'll set up and dry in about 20 minutes, and it'll bond to the latex/acrylic paint you used as a wash better.  This is available in the home centers and most hardware stores.<br>  <br>  (5)  When the sealers dried you need to re-sand the door, this time using #320 sandpaper and vac/air and tack it down again.<br>  <br>  (6) Here's where we get the look you want in the finished product.  Apply a top and final finish coat of Min-Wax "Polycrylic" Urethane in satin, semi-gloss- or gloss to the door.  I prefer satin and two coats will give you a beautiful protective finish that will last.<br>  <br>  There are applications where waterborne products perform exceptionally well. . . this is one of them. It won't yellow as with traditional petroleum based urethanes; the finish dries faster, and it is harder/tougher when cured.<br>   <br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.com</a>|`|onbwN4csaa	Thin out the closest color you can find to what you want. keep thinning it until you get what your looking for.

For standard-sized dishwashers, for example, the US standard for dishwasher efficiency is an 'energy factor' of 0.46, which means you can do 0.46 loads of dishes (12 place settings plus six 'serving dishes') with one kilowatt hour, or 2.2 kilowatt hours per load. On the other hand, the most energy efficient standard dishwasher, the Equator PLS600, has an energy factor of 1.29, which means it takes only 0.77 kwh per load. So you could be saving up to 0.53 kwh per load, which is over 100 kwh per year. Okay, that probably only saves you $10-15 a year at today's electricity prices, but electricity prices are likely to rise fast over the next few years, plus you'll be doing your bit to save the planet. And don't forget the cost of the water; the most efficient dishwashers use hardly any water (less than 4 gallons for a full load).<br>  <br>  Bosch and Asko are other manufacturers with high-quality, very efficient dishwashers.<br>  <br>  As for not much $$$, remember to factor in the total life cycle costs (ie. the energy, water, and detergent you'll have to pay for), not just the sticker price.

uoeOFtqvaa	First you will have to sand, depending on the amount of stain used, type of stain used and your skill level you may have to use a belt sander to strip it.  If you are inexperienced then I suggest a finishing sander and hand sanding it to get it cleaned up at a slower pace.  After you have stripped in completely then make sure you wash the surface and clear it of any residue or excess dust before applying stain.  After you have done all of this apply your stain, there are many products out there that are a stain and clear coat mixed, for the best results I do not suggest these.  I suggest applying your stain to the color to the penetration level and color you want, the more you apply then dry and then apply the more penetration of color you will have and the darket it will be.  After you have applied it to the color you want then apply 2 to 3 layers of polyurethane to protect your finish.  I suggest more than 1 layer of the polyurethane especially on solid pieces that you are going to want to maintain for a long period of time and that will get heavy use.  <br>  <br>  Best of Luck in your venture.|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	You don't need to remove the old finish unless the table is very scratched, then you'll need to sand it first.
