20090227141508AA6TU8p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Formula feeding moms.  Please read?	I live in a small little town that doesn't have a grocery store.  It has just a little convenience store.  So here is the thing.  I live 11 miles from the nearest town that has a grocery store, and I don't have a car.  My mom was supposed to come up from where she lives tomorrow and take me to the grocery store, but she just called and said she can't come until monday.  My baby is on Similac Sensitive, and we only have a half of a can left.  The little store here where I live, sells only Similac Advance, and it is like 18.99 for a small can.  My question is, is my baby going to be ok if I have to end up buying the Advance if I can't find a ride to town with anyone else?  I usually buy 6 cans at a time or so when I go to town, so usually I don't have to worry about this happening, but now with my mom not being able to come until monday from where she lives, I am super stressed out about what to do.  Is it bad to use a different formula even if only for a couple of days?  I know my baby HAS to have the formula, but if I can't find another ride to town, I am going to have to buy the Similac Advance from the little store here in my town.  I feel like $hit for letting this type of thing happen, and now I am kind of freaking out about what to do.  Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?  Is it ok to give her the advance for a couple of days?

20090227140349AAmQNJT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	When did your baby's milia disappear?	I'm a first time mom and my baby girl is 5 weeks old. She has a few milia bumps on her nose. The last couple of days they appeared to be coming to a head. I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to scrub them so I rubbed her nose with a warm washcloth thinking it would exfoliate them a little and help them drain out. I feel terrible because it just made her nose pink and irritated. I called the dr.'s office and spoke with a nurse and she said scrubbing it would have just irritated her skin and shouldn't have done any damage so not to worry. Just to wait and they should disappear on their own. So I was just wondering when it usually starts disappearing. If your baby had any milia how old were they when it started to heal and go away? Thanks!

Date of start of last period: January 23   Usual cycle length: 29-31 days      I was completely regular for the past 4 months, and I should've gotten my period on February 22.

20090227135929AAroURq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Is low progestrone a chronic problem?	In December of 06 I found out I was pregnant then lost it 8 weeks later I then became pregnant again in April of 07 had a perfect pregnancy and delivered a perfect daughter, I am 6 weeks now and I have been spotting for 3 days I had my progesterone tested and it came back at 5 and my hCG only went from 200 on tues to 300 on wed.  My doctor said it would be a miracle for this pregnancy to last, he did start me on progesterone supotisorties yesterday and I am still taking them.  With my first loss I didn't have any testing done, I switched to my current doctor during my second pregnancy and he did some blood tests for anything outstanding that could have caused the first and nothing came back.  My question is could it be my problem that I do not produce enough progesterone that is making me loose my babies and my daughter was just a miracle?  I just cant say the words out loud to ask my doctor right now.  Any information or advice is  appreciated.
20090227140014AAAtXU8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Penalty for not paying an OB/GYN fee?	I am 32 weeks pregnant, and the receptionist at the OB/GYN I use decided to tell us at my 26 week appointment that we will owe my doctor $2500 for the global delivery fee and it is due by my due date (April 21). She said no insurance covers the fee and it must be paid by April 21. I feel it is very unfair for them to wait SO long to tell me about the fee, and expect my husband and I to have no problem coming up with $2500 in 14 weeks with no problem. The same time she told me about the $2500 she also said "Oh, well you should have paid us $850 last time you were here to make a payment towards to fee to put in a holding account". How could I have paid the fee if we didn't even know about it? And they are acting like we just have this money laying around! I asked her if it could be added to the hospital bill and be paid in installments and she said no. I asked if there were any payment plans available and she said no. My husband and I have already talked about it and we are NOT going to have $2500 by April. We have other bills to pay and that is just too much money for us to save in such a short time frame. Any advice on what to do? Can my doctor report us to collections? I have an appointment this coming Tuesday and plan to give her a piece of my mind about waiting so long to tell us about the fee and let her know we won't have the money, but wanted to get some ideas from here first. Thanks in advance.

20090227135830AAb0SP6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How to get toddler to play alone?	My daughter (2yrs 4 months) was a very clingy baby, she's very independant in the way that she likes to put toothpaste on the brush herself, pick her clothes,put her own coat on, climb into her car seat etc, all on her own but she never plays alone.    Because her bed is in our room we turned her room into a big playroom with a big sandpit, hundreds of books, boxes and bins full of toys, everything from farm sets, train set,bricks,cars,dolls,houses, dress up and lots of craft items - its like a nursery but she's not really interested in any of it, she constantly says "play with me mummy" so I do play all day & all night,if I walk off for one minute she goes crackers and pulls on me, and even though I play with the toys she jst watches me.The games she likes are roleplay, we pretend everything from being on a train to london,a plane to corfu to shopping and being at the hairdressers.    I don't mind because shes an only child and want her to be happy but I know how important it is to play alone sometimes. Also at playgroups shes not interested in other kids, she still only wants to play with me doing most of the work.    I'll agree its my fault but how can I encourage her to enjoy her own company or other childrens company?

I know it will be hard and i know it will be frustrating and expensive but i just really wana be a mother at heart. i feel its worth it.    i want to hear what all the other mothers out there have to say about it. if you could take it all back would you? do you feel its worth everything it takes out of you to be a mother.    we both are working full time $10 an hour jobs but we get benefits and annual raises and I get quarterly bonuses. do you think this is enough to raise a baby on?

Okay, I'm 13 years old, and I have my first babysitting job! :]   I'm so excited, but also kind-of nervous, and a bit unsure about it all.      I'm babysitting for a 4 and a half year old girl, who is very finicky and, well, even her mother said that she acts like a princess, and is a pill. When I went over to meet the family last night, she didn't say hi, she sat in front of the television, that's it. All she did was say bye to me, after her mother forced her to. She's a real girly-girl, as well, apparently. What should I do with her?      The little boy, who is 7, should be a breeze, thank goodness. He's just like my brother, and he and I really hit it off last night! He isn't who I'm worried about, it's more the girl.      Also, I'll be babysitting from 7:30 to about 12:30, and I'll be putting the kids to bed.    What should I bring to their house?       Thank you all for your help :]

20090227141800AAKYPQ4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Tips for dealing with postpartum depression?	Im 20, and I have a 3 week old daughter. i think that I have been mildly depressed for years now. But since I have had her things have gotten a lot worse. My husband works and goes to school so I am home alone a lot of the time. I cry all the time and I never know what is wrong. Anything my husband does try to do to make it better, just makes it worse. I don't love my daughter and that really upsets me. I really wanted to be a mom, and now that I am I don't have any emotions for her. I take care of her and everything but I don't feel any connection. I feel more like i am baby-sitting and i just want her parents to come get her already.   I have a drs appt on monday but i am afraid that they are just going to put me on a bunch of meds and i dont want that.    I used to smoke weed when I would start to get depressed, but now that im breast-feeding smoking just makes it worse because i feel guilty   I just dont know what to do.   Does any one have any advice for dealing with this?

I've tried explaining the big girl thing to her.. she drinks from an open cup and non spill straw cups just fine but refuses to drink milk out of them..I read an article a dietitian wrote that suggested if you add more cheese, yogurt, cereal with milk etc. to the child's diet it can replace milk as a drink...but the problem still lies with breaking her of the bottle... what can I do?

I'm 8 months pregnant (35 weeks), and over the past week or 2, my stomach has become VERY finicky. Through most of my pregnancy, I was able to eat everything I wanted, and felt fine. I ate healthy, and gained the reccomended amount of weight. But for the past week or 2, I haven't been able to eat anything. I feel perfectly fine, except that anything aside from yogurt, milk, water, applesauce and bread makes me throw up. I've been trying to eat healthy, and I've made sure I eat as healthy as possible, but it's miserable. Has this happened to anyone else? I called my doctor. The nurse didn't seem concerned since I'm feeling fine otherwise, and to wait until my Wedsenday appointment to talk to my doctor. I was just wondering if this happened to anyone else, and how you dealt with it.

20081105095809AAd5SDu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Leaning towards naming our son Wyatt, but having a hard time with middle names.. ?	I think we have picked 2 names but we're leaning towards Wyatt. I have two 3.5 year old twin girls and I wanted to name my son something that I liked but that also had a nice meaning, he is going to have to be a strong booger to defend himself from 2 big sisters and also to protect two sisters.. so i wanted to give him a name with a nice meaning, which is why we picked Wyatt we love the name and meaning.. meaning: brave/strong/strength/war..       We have not decided if we want to give him a middle name that is linked to the family or not. With my twins one has the middle name of a life long friend, the other has one i just liked... so its not the most important thing to me. IF we did give him a middle name after someone these would be it   Steven - this is my husbands first name or   Nicholas - this is my grandfathers name, and my name is Nicole, i am named after my grandfather.       Do you think one of those would go really well with Wyatt, or do you have one your think would be really fitting for the name and for the reasons behind the name..       sorry that got long just giving some background so you know how we are naming our child.. thanks in advance
20080608161036AAHYbtv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Need some advice urgently?!?!?

I haven't had a period since 19th december 07 i went to the doctors about 2 months after missing my period and they did a qualitive blood test for pregnancy and it came back negative and on friday just gone i went back for more blood tests as the doctors wouldn't do anything until i had missed it for 5 months, I'm due to see the doctors on tuesday to get the results and a pelvic examination. My syptoms are Dizziness, feeling very tired, strong headaches at about 8pm very night for the past week or so, diareoh normally after 8pm at night for the past 2 nights, feeling really bloted and a really strong sense of smell!

20081014114905AAU96Vg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Protein in Urine - 34.5 wks?	I've had a little more swelling the last couple weeks, along with slightly high blood pressure (corrected by resting, etc) and +1 protein in my urine the last 2 weeks. Doc did a 24 hour urine test and blood work, both of which were fine. I have quite a bit of extra amniotic fluid as well - not seeing spots or anything but do get more frequest smaller headaches.      Is there another reason that I could have protein in the urine without being preeclampsia? Or could this just be mild preeclampsia and that's why my Doc doesn't seem concerned at this point? Anyone of you had a similar situation? Just want to be in the know and being a 1st timer, everything scares the crap out of me lol :)      Thanks :)

Lately I have been having swollen, tender, tingly breasts with blue veins all over them, lower abdominal cramping, feeling queesy in the evenings, headaches, increased sense of smell, metallic taste in my mouth, and disrupted digestion, a light irregular "period" and have been incredibly moody. But I got a negative hpt at 14 days after unprotected sex.  I understand that some symptoms can be all in my head but some of them I didn't even know that they were signs of pregnancy until after I had them and then looked them up online. So I don't think I made them up b/c I was thinking I could be pregnant.    How far along did you ladies get a positive test? Shouldn't it be positive 14 days after sex?      I already had what may have been a period or implantation bleeding (idk) so please don't tell me to wait until I'm late or that it's probably just PMS.       I'm just looking to hear about other people's experiences and if anyone may have had a similar situation and found out they were pg.   Thanks!

Hi, I am 23 and pregnant with 2nd child with same partner. 1st baby completely perfect and healthy. Had my 12 week scan Tuesday, everything normal and perfect. Nural Transleucency taken measured 2.0mm, so I was told this is perfect, low risk of Downs Syndrome, equatity to risk of 1:2100   Received a call today from midwife, my blood tests have shown a higher risk of Downs, equating to risk of 1:95.   Combining NT and blood = risk 1:250. I amnow really worried, have to go in tomorrow to have another scan. Do I have the CVS test or wait for the Amnio test? I'm so confused. I don't know what to do.    I was told my blood could be showing problems due to other things. Could this have anything to do with previous use of Implanon implant??

Well, when she became pregnant, she changed and got all mad at me when I flirted with her husband (by the way, she would flirt with my husband- it's just the way we were- nothing was ever thought of it). Then he would really come on to me sometimes but, I just blew it off. Now she is mad and won't talk to me because she said I got on her nerves and that I was flirting with her husband. Well, that's the way our relationship was!! So anyway, when she had her baby in May was the last time I saw her and I called her a month ago and she still acted distant. When will she get over this. I want serious answers only. We were real close friends. I mean they come over to our house near about every weekend. I miss her and I don't know what to do.

20080928220529AAxcbny	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What chance, if any, is there that this woman's baby is mine?	This was basically the first time that I have been with a girl and actually had sex (I had penetration before, but never came, and it was only a couple times, very briefly).  Anyways, with this girl, I had sex with her several times, and came inside her (no protection).      I don't believe I had had sex with her past November 16h or 17th, 2007.  She told me that she took the morning after pill (she got two of them).  And took them both as she was instructed to do so.      A few days later she said she was starting her period.  I believe I had sex with her one last time (again, I believe the date was before the 16th or 17th).       After thanksgiving break she broke up with me.  About two months later, from reading her MySpace page, I found out she was pregnant.      I asked her about it, and she said it was not mine.      So...this basically having been my first time, I felt terrible.  Here was a potential mother to my child, and she would not even let me know if it was mine.      So over the next nine months I watched her MySpace page, because she would not give me any info.      I 'believe' her supposed due date was August 28th.  She ended up having the baby on September 10th, 2008 I believe (I believe by C-Section, because she knew the day ahead).      In August, when I found out she was having the baby, I freaked, and sent her one final message pleading with her to please tell me the truth.  She said that it was not mine, and that she had been with someone else at the end of November.      I looked online, and did a reverse from the supposed due date...and it predicted that the conception date was December 6th I believe it said.         Having sex was way out of something I would ordinarily do.  I was planning on saving myself for marriage.  However there were really hard real life circumstances going on in my life, and I'm getting older (was 23 going on 24 at the time of it happening), and I was relatively attracted to the girl...(she is 27)...so I just did it.      I suffered the consequences of wondering day in day out for 9 months if this child could possibly be mine (If it is, I REALLY REALLY want to know).       This is still deeply affecting me, as I am not 100% sure, and I guess I wanted to get the opinions of others, possibly a doctor.  The is weighing heavily on my soul and conscience, and I hope that you can tell that from what I've written.      If someone can provide a serious answer, please do so.  I beg of you, please try to be sensitive to this issue...it's really hit home with me, and has been on my mind constantly since I found out she was pregnant back in January.

She’s never made her own bed, let alone her own meal.

She’s beautiful. Long blonde hair, at least mid waist length, heart shaped face. Deep, emerald green eyes that can be read like a book. Her eyes are like a passage to her soul. Can see right through them. The apple of many boys’ eyes. Not only because she’s beautiful, but also because her inheritance.

I have taken several tests, but they are all negative.  I can't get in to see my doctor until Tuesday.     My questions are: Do you think it is just too early for a HPT to tell??  And what are some other things that could cause these things to come about?   Keep in mind, I am not stressed out for any particular reason.(other then wondering what is going on but that is minimal)  Thanks in advance...and please no rude answers...I'm not stupid enough to ask you to predict whether or not I am pregnant.   
20081109122627AAsK5Q9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Have any of you ladies gotten your significant others to wear a pregnancy pack while you were pregnant?	My boyfriend and i were talking last night about our plans to get married and have kids and he rubbed my stomach and said "i can't wait until you're huge and pregnant". Now he's a very sensitive guy and loves the thought of my carrying our baby, he thinks pregnancy is amazing when it comes to a woman carrying a growing baby for 9 months and caring for it that way so he meant his statement as a good thing. But the "huge" part caught me so i said, call me huge or big or whatever all you want but don't let the words hit my ears. Because i know i'll be big, but i don't need my husband telling me i'm huge constantly haha.      Then we got into a discussion about how women are the lucky ones who get to carry the babies...and he's right. Women have the chance to form an amazing bond with their kids that men will never get to. But we also get the extra weight and the big belly and everyone walking up to us thinking they have the right to rub and touch our bellies. So i told him that in my 6th or 7th month, he was getting a pregnancy pack so he knows how it is to have those things. At first he outright refused saying that it's a woman's job to be pregnant but then i got him to agree to doing it for 2 or 3 days haha.      Even though our getting married and having a baby is still quite a ways off, i'm not forgetting this one...way too excited to see it haha.      Have any of you gotten your boyfriends or husbands to do this while you were pregnant so they knew what it felt like? Or do any of you wish you would have?

I realized a night or 2 before we left the hospital that I either had a bad earache, or headache its hard to tell which one.

20081109135905AAsGmA4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Having an an ultrasound on Friday and I'll be 20 weeks have some questions!?

20081117144843AA7Iyg7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Alright all you nutty mums lets unite!! Share your silly stuff?	Ok now i have to admit it, i dig my own grave here   I am always drawn to horrible stories and watch them on you tube about all the poor children that suffer abuse and My personal hate is Shaken baby syndrome.    I watch them and their stories and just cry and cry and cry about the lives lost or ruined.   So watching these i have very little to Absolutely no trust in other people looking after my son.   I love my son to absolute pieces but would  also love just an afternoon alone to sleep, or exercise and do something on my own.   But there is the issue i cant leave him   I have left him 2 times so far for 2 hours each time  with my mother in law, so i can get my waxing and brazillian done which is soooo not relaxing lol but it is the two times i have left him.   He is 17 weeks old so a few days off 4 months old      I cant get past the statistics of it being 60-70% of the abusers being your closest friends and relatives and childcarers.   So the two times i have left him i have worried about him the entire time and have really had no enjoyment.    I cant really leave him with my own mother as she is 3 hours away and that is too much time.    The other issue is the 3 people i would leave him with is my mother who also wakes him everytime she sees him and my mother in law just doesnt put him into bed to have a sleep lol so when i have gotten back he is cranky and exhausted    And my sister in law who lives about an hour and a half away also...    Oh and on the weekends i have a mini break as daddy is home from work so he will hold him or talk to him for a little while BUT it doesnt help if i want to sleep as he wont change his nappy or make his formula up arggghhh!!!!   Arrggghh so what do you do that is absolutely stupid but you do it anyhow....

20081115145725AAXHuba	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anyone been to this baby sex prediction website?	www.babyman.net   I was just going to see what he would predict I may have just for fun.  He predicts the sex based on the conception month and age you will be when your due date is.  I went there when I was pregnant for my first and he predicted a boy, which was correct.  I then did the one for my sister when she had her baby and it predicted correctly.  Anyways I did like 6 different pregnancies (already born) and they were all predicted correctly.  Anyone have the same results?  If you already have children go by when they were conceived and see if your result comes out right.  Or if you are pregnant you can go there just to see what he predicts, maybe you know the sex (from ultrasound) and you can see if he tells you the same.  It's all in good fun but I am surprised with the results I got!      Let me know, I am looking forward to the answers!

20081117114014AAIanQB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What is making you sick during your pregnancy?	My kitchen smells like metal and it is the worst smell I have smelled before. Apparently it didn't do anything in the past but now it just stinks so much and I always gag or throw up. I think my prenatal pills make me nauseated too. If I take them while eating when I wake up, I'm nauseated during the day. If I take them at night, I don't feel anything during the day, but I get nauseated at night... hmm... During my first pregnancy I couldn't even look at bread.      What's your nauseated smell or food?
20081110185934AA3ok9Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Few questions about ttc...?	my breasts are very swollen and hurt a lot! in the past week they keep hurting more and more and getting more and more swollen, today i put my bra on, and they just keep falling out.   im also very bloated..im not constipated, i have no explanation for it.      so i guess my question is, when your boobs became very sensitive and sore, did you take a test that said positive?   also when you noticed you were really bloated, and had no explanation (&ttc) did you take a test and did it give you a positive result?   i've also been having mild cramps for the past week and a half, they don't hurt they are just annoying...i still think its too early to test, thats why i have these questions!   thank you in advance!

I read about this crap all the time and the system is so *** backwards.  I get a pell grant (no kids) but mine is cut back because i turned 25 (makes no sense)....but if I had a child i would get my full grant back PLUS get money at the end of the year....PLUS i could get SRS to help with the maternity care.      How I see it....if this was to happen I could have more time at home to spend with the child while not having to pick up a bunch of hours to cover the hospital bill and post-hospital.      I've been in school 5 years and currently working on my second degree.  PLEASE DON'T take it wrong if you have children and get a full pell grant....i am really happy for you because it is great that the support is there...i'm just saying that the system is really off!

Do people compare labour to stretching your upper lip over your head when this is IMPOSSIBLE!!!!?      my answer was cheers for that as im 40+6 weeks and dont really need to be scared about the birth what u think      i answer this question and i got this reply          Subject: Why did you say cheers for that?       Message: I feel really very hurt that you put yeah cheers for that to my question about how I was agonising and have for for years about what people say about the lip thing and labour, I did say that I had trauma in my past and am not a well person and I was not expecting people to start critisise me because they are expecting because I can't help what other people say and I was saying that I was distressed because I couldn't see how they could be right, not because I agreed with it! didn't help me that you said something like that and then left me wondering what you meant, and wondering did it mean you had a fear because of what I said and seriously thought labour was as bad as the things I put down because I could not bear a person seriously thinking that, and if they did I would think how the hell could they resist topping themselves? I say what I say because I am a seriously disturbed person who has been through terrible sexual abuse and neglect and heartbreak and that is why I fear things so much and fear bad things are going to be a repetition of that, are you telling me that is so? And you were angry with me because you seriously thought I was right about that? I was wanting people to console me and tell me things are not as bad in that department as the emotionally devastating things I have been though but you just made me feel that you thought I was right and you were angry with me for reminding you. I hope you can reply and tell me isn't the case as has distressed terribly.
20081109135111AA0Ewbr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Ugh, I'm FED UP! Last trimester joys...?	So not trying to rant, but am wondering who else is/has been going through this???   I'm achy in my low abdomen, ALL DAY have felt like I have to, um, "go" (not pee). And even though I have already twice today (sorry, tmi), the feeling is still really bad/strong. I have these SHOOTING, weird vaginal pains, which increase when I stand up/walk, and have started to have braxton hicks, which I didn't have for the past few months, and I have way more mucous/discharge now than ever before (again, sorry, tmi)... ARGH! I'm sick of pregnancy pains... not to mention feeling like I need to puke/having a weird, strong gag reflex all of a sudden since yesterday.   Anyone else???

20081115145200AAGdYkP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is my girlfriend lying about being pregnant?	My gf said was late so she took a hpt and it was negative. 1 week later she took another and it was neg. Then we ended up splitting up and right before we did she bled a lot and then it quit again. Anyway I moved out and she didn't want me to go. She was being really dramatic and saying she could change and she would go to a doctor and see why she had extreme highs and lows etc. So I was moved back to my hometown for like a week and she told me that she went to the doc and she was diagnosed bi polar and that now she was on lithium and she would not act like that anymore. Then about a few days later she tells me "Well I went to the doctor again and I am pregnant and he said that the bleeding (which she told me once was a miscarriage) was just something clotted or stuck or whatever and that now she is pregnant. This is all very hard to swallow. So just as I started to believe she's pregnant and got back together with her now she's back home and she called today and said I'm bleeding and I called the doctor and I'm scared but they said not to worry if it stops. Later tonight she told me it was stopped after like an hour. This is all really messing with my head and the docs appointment isn't til the 28th! So I asked her to pee on another stick and let me see, because I wanted to know for myself what was going on. I told her I saw some things that indicated that lithium could be dangerous in the first trimester and that when she scares me by saying things like "I'm bleeding for an hour and I'm scared" that I would like to have talked to a doctor so I could reference that conversation and console myself and her. She basically flipped out and was crying and said she didn't have anything to hide but was making a real big deal about it. I just don't know what to think til i talk to this doc. Last night I was looking at baby rooms to get ideas and I already had like 4 name ideas and this is lame if she's lying. What do you think?

20090307110823AAazePo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What can be done about kids behaviour today?	I'm not sure how describe what I want to ask exactly but let me give you an example so you might have an idea of what I'm talking about.      I was walking down the main shopping street today and I saw 2 kids sitting in front of a shop and smoking. They couldn't have been any older than 10 each. Although I found the sight of this disturbing what shocked me more was that I was the only person who was even looking at them. Hundreds of shoppers just walking by, not even lifting an eyebrow. So I went over, pulled it out their mouths. They shouted for me to give it back and swore in levels that rivalled that legendary scene from the Exorcist. I just told them we could all go to the police station together and they can ask the policeman if I should give it back. They hissed and walked off, still swearing. Oddly though, this scene seemed to get allot of people's attention, but still no one did or said anything.      Perhaps my actions were a bit bold, but I'm asking about how did things get this far? And what should be done about it? As this is not the first time I've seen something like this and I'm sure most you out there have as well since I doubt this is a local problem.      Remember the issue isn't about underage smoking or drinking it's about behaviour in general.
20081111180454AAE6H0A	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant, scared, and guilty?	THe back story is that I am 18 years old and I'm a freshman at Vanderbilt U and I'm not that rich so I'm here on scholarship. I shouldn't feel bad about that, but I'm surrounded by really rich kids, who are so snobby sometimes that I feel like I have to hide the fact that I have a scholarship.      The big story is that a couple of months ago, I went to a party, drank way too much, and I ended up sleeping with this guy. He is super rich, but really really nice. I got pregnant from that night and so now I am having the baby.       Of course everything was really bad back then when we first told our families, but now it's better, but like I said, my guy's family is really, REALLY rich, and his mom still talks to me like I'm some kind of whore. I want to tell her that I didn't get my own self pregnant, but I just keep my mouth shut.      She makes me feel like poor trash and a slut. The guy, his name is ___ Stowe, is nice to me, and prepared to become a father, but his mother is just horrible to me.      What am I supposed to do? I can't shut her out of my life, but I can't really fight with her either. My guy has talked to her before about how she treats me, and she always apologizes, but then she turns around and does the exact same thing.       She makes it seem like I "ruined" her son, but she doesn't stop to think that I come from a good and kind family, and they didn't anticipate that this would ever happen to me either.

Clear snotty discharge?   i was in the bathroom when i realized i was havin this snotty lookin discharge. it was clear and looked just like snot coming out of my vagina. whats it from? my period doesnt come until the 30th.      yes i've had unprotected sex twice the day i realized it. and once the day before that. :/   and protected sex on the 11th.      he didnt *** in me. i know there is precum but we have had unprotected sex for like 3 months and i never got pregnant before so he pulls out way before he cums and jacks it off to ***.    so is it possible im still pregnant.   everyone says it means im ovulating but its never happened before.   and well im scared that im pregnant now cause people say its a big possibility. :/

It's pretty small, but the most fabulous family restroom I've ever been in! They had to like super long changing tables. With the paper on rolls like at the doctors office. There was a big sink. Rocking Chairs, they beside outlets (which is a huge plus because I have to pump), and then the bathroom with a door. I was very impressed! Plus while I was pumping 2 women came in and talked to me about breastfeeding. It was soooo hard to communicate b/c english wasn't their first language and I only know english and german. We were mostly playing charades. lol. But they kept talking about how fabulous breastfeeding (made me feel good). They had this wonderful family restroom and these wonderful people, I feel like just going there for a visit. lol. What are your experiences with family restrooms?

She is acting fine, playing laughing, sleeping well, and no fever.  She is fine when she nurses.

20081122201233AAbLEgA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What is this medication from the late 80s? Has the purpose to not have a miscarriage.?	I have looked everywhere I can think of for this medication but I just can't find it. I don't even know a good place to look. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.   This drug was used in the late 80s and may still be used to avoid a  miscarriage and taken during pregnancy. (It keeps the mother from having a miscarriage). But one adverse affect this drug has is to the nervous system, causing the mother to be 'skittish' or timid, etc... the fetus may also be affected in this way and can cause the nervous system to develop more slowly, even develop after being born.

20090216114713AA65yRr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could this leg pain be caused by my pregnancy?	I am twenty weeks pregnant and yesterday during the day my hips and upper part of my legs started to hurt really bad. It isn't muscle pain, it feels more like the pain of a toothache only in my legs. Today I woke up and it was much worse and has traveled down both of my legs, though mainly the left one. My left foot is also cramping up really badly today. I don't know if this is common during pregnancy or not. I'm also really tired. It hurts to walk and it hurts to straighten my legs out. It is a constant pain, it doesn't just hurt to move them, it hurts all the time. Just wondering if maybe someone else experienced this when they were pregnant and if it was just a normal pregnancy thing. The pain also comes and goes in my left arm...it just comes in jolts there.

20090307104731AAd40Sd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How to convince brother in law's gf that having a preemie baby is bad?!?	This is long so don't bother reading if your going to ***** and complain.      My brother in law and his 19 year old girlfriend are expecting a baby in june. To be truthful she is an absolute mess. Her mother and holistic dr have had her thinking that she would not live past 25 years old due to all these illnesses that she supposidely had. Now that she is pregnant her dr's have done all these tests and low and behold she is healthy! Just really lazy and unwilling to beleive that she will be ok. Unfortunatly she has used her illnesses to get what she has wanted through out her life so now she is looking for something else to get sympathy for.       nfortunatly things aren't looking good for their future and I feel bad for the child. She drinks, smokes, was doing cocaine, and is  feels she will never have to work and is content to live under her parents roof and mooch off of family and freinds. She ha28 weeks and has gained only 5 pounds >.<  even turned down things for the baby becase they arn't designer or she wants something better...      I am quite worried about their parenting skills, having gone through 5 puppies in 7 months, all of whom have been given away or taken to the spca. One she thought was ugly so she got rid of it. If her child is ill and in the hospital or has a birthmark is she going to give the baby away?       This is her 4th pregnancy but first child (no  wonder as she was doing heavy drugs, drinking, takes about 25 differnent herbal pills, and is anorexic) and they got pregnant about a month after meeting.      Now she is convinced that she is going to have a preemie baby and is actually proud and excited for it? She is pretty sure she is going to have her baby next month and doesn't feel there is anything wrong with that. My biggest suspicion is that she is hoping her baby will be born before me.      I had a miscarriage in may last year so this time when we got pregnant we didn't tell anyone until we were 12 weeks.  SHe was very upset to learn I was infact about a month ahead of her and unfortunatly she now dispises me and everyone else in the family.       How can we convince her that having a preemie is NOT a good thing and even thinking about it is horrible. I have talked to many people who have had preemies and have read so many horror stories that it just breaks my heart. Their main priority should be positive thoughts and focusing on eating healthy and living healthy so that their baby is healthy and doesn't end up in NICU for 2-3 months.

My "boyfriend" who's the baby's father has been taking it really hard. The first couple of days I was like super depressed, and I'm still upset, but he's been taking it way worse. Of course I took some days off of work, but he's been taking a couple of days off. When he found out about the baby (we weren't together at the time) he was So supportive, and we were both looking forward to having the baby, even though it wasn't planned. After the miscarriage he became WAY overprotective, and a couple of days ago I asked to just let me have some time to let it sink in for a bit, and we were away from each other for a couple of days, and then he asked me to move in with him. I said no, because I know he only asked me because we just lost our baby, and he's emotional. I'm so confused, he not even actually my "boyfriend," I'm still confused about our relationship. I love him, but the reason we broke up is because he was pressuring me to sleep with him (that's how I got pregnant in the first place). I'm not sure what I should do. I'm so confused about everything. Please help me.

I heard further along in the pregnancy you can get out of breath because the uterus gets too big to fit in your pelvic region so it moves up and squishes your abdomen which presses against your lungs, but I'm only 10 weeks!  Isn't it a little too early for this?  At my first prenatal appointment I also had high blood pressure(which I never have had pre pregnancy) and the nurse said I probably was just excited but now I'm worried I might be getting hypertension or something.  Has anyone else had this?

20081111175038AAiSQ6U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My girlfriend is 2 days late from her period. help!!!!?	three weeks ago we made love (both of us for the first time). We used a condom and she has been on birth control for over a year taking it at the same time every day. What are the chances of her being preg?

Please help.      ps: were both 16. We dont want to hear about how we shouldnt of done it in the first place. Were well edjucated on the risks it can bring.

20081115123305AABsnxe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Morning sickness or YAZ side effects?? HELP?	I started taking YAZ birth control on Monday. My doctor told me to take it when I got it, which was not the sunday after, or the day of my period. It was 6 DPO.       On Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, 9 hours after taking the pill (pill still effective because it was more than 4 hours after), I threw up two times. I had a headache, and nausea all of Wednesday. Thursday and Friday, I've had sore breasts, and mild cramping. And MOOD SWINGS. Right now, Saturday morning, I feel nauseated. I hope I don't throw up later.       So. Is it possible that I am pregnant while taking the pill? My LMP was Oct. 21st. Could this be why I threw up ? Or was it just a side effect of YAZ?      Side note: During my ovulation time, I had sex...but we used the pull out method..   It's also important to note that I was not on birth control for this entire cycle, so my body did ovulate on it's own. If I'm pregnant, it's not because bcps didn't work, or I didn't take them, it's because I wasn't using them.

20081122144134AAI0tPk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I be pregnant? Mothers and mothers to be help please?	My body has been doing some weird things lately. First my breast got tender a little early this month. Then I had sharp pains in my uterus...nothing really painful, but noticeable. Then my discharge completely stopped...that has never happened to me before since I hit puberty years ago. Then I got my "period" a week early. I looked up the sharp pains online and it said that it could be your uterus stretching and that the early period could be implantation bleeding. My period is a little lighter than normal and also brighter....i have been having back pains and I also gained a moderate headache yesterday...I looked this up and it also said these are signs of early pregnancy. I then developed a stuffy nose and kept sneezing last night, but I am fine today so I looked that up which the net said that developing cold like symptoms is also a sign and your body's way of breaking down your immune system so it won't fight off the baby as an invader. THEN I could BARELY breathe last night...I was really short of breath. This has happened to me before in the past after drinking light alcohol, but I have not been drinking because of me being skeptical about me being pregnant. I looked that up as well...and guess what...another early sign of pregnancy. It seems as if everytime I look up a symptom my body is having without even typing in "pregnancy", the net relates it back to pregnancy and I do NOT expect that to be the answer, such as for headaches and stuffy noses, difficulty in breathing...etc.  If I am NOT pregnant then I have NO idea what is going on with my body lately. I want to take a pregnancy test but I read if I am having implantation bleeding that I have to wait a little while for the results to be most accurate. Some people have taken tests during or shortly after the implantation bleeding and returned neg. results when they were indeed pregnant. I don't want to be misled. Thoughts everyone? Thanks.

My husband and were not trying but I am very happy that I might be.  I am going to go to the doctors to find out for sure on Monday.   With that being said I was at a birthday party a little over  week ago we were all drinking and let me just say I NEVER smoke or take drugs EVER.  Until then someone gave me half of a pot brownie.  I normally wouldn't have.  I am disappointed in myself.  My question is could it have hurt my baby, and should I tell my doctor? Do they do a drug test when they test for pregnancy? I read online and a friend told me that they could take the baby away so I am scared to say anything.  It was seriously a one time bad decision.  Obviously no more drinking either.  I am very worried about this.   Here is some TMI that might help answering me.  I had intercourse the 24th the 28th was the day of the brownie and I had intercourse again on the 2nd.

20090307111709AAsmRB7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Stay-at-hom-mums vs working mothers?	Did you choose to either be a "stay-at-home" mother or did you choose be in full-time paid work and pay for either day-care or a nanny to care for your children whilst you are work? If this was a choice, do you ever regret you choice? If this was not out of choice, do you resent not being able to either stay at home with your children or not being able to continue with your careers? Do you feel that the other side of the fence has it easier (ie stay-at home mothers have it easier because they are not in paid work or working mothers have it easier because they pay for someone else to care for their child/children)?   I'm simply after respectful opinions and experience, not attacks.   Thanks.

I think it's because he's teething, and while it's never been a problem before, he's cutting and incisor and a molar at the same time which is probably quite difficult for the little guy.      I have been putting Sudocrem on him at every nappy change, but the rash seems to be getting much worse and now looks like it's about to turn into open sores. He's in a lot of pain when I change and wipe him, so I'd like to sort it out as quickly as possible.       Can anyone recommend anything besides Sudocrem which might get the job done a bit quicker?

He will try to kiss her and give her hugs but she shoves him away and squeals? He watches her when I m at work most of the time cause he has rotating shifts and I work second, she does go to her grandparent's when we are both at work. She will slap at him too. I m just worried that he is mean to her or hits her when I m not around. But in his defense he has two kids from a previous marriage, they are older 9 and 15, and I have never seen him hurt them in that way. Sure they dont like being grounded or what not...i only saw him spank his son once, since i have known him for 4 yrs...what do you think? Is he mean to her when I m not around? Does he beat her when no one is watching? She has no bruises...or am I just being paranoid??

My doc told me its better to have the epidural, i think, but i'm SO scared.  I need more info and reassurance.  If you can be of help I would gladly appreciate any information you can give me.

Don't know the gender yet, so I'm open to suggestions for both genders.      I like classic names for both sexes, strong, masculine names for boys and pretty, feminine names for girls. The surname is Calloway. Any suggestions?
