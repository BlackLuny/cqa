But I played the demo and couldn't stop thinking "what a load of rubbish" I personally think they have ruined the series.<br>  <br>  If you want a good horror game get FEAR or FEAR2: Project origin.

kYf2IiMEaa	first of all funnest isn't a word. lol<br>  If you want to a really fun deck to make that would be Gladiator Beast since they can tag out and in.<br>  Or if you want to have fun building a deck make a billy deck, those decks are based on something such as foods, toys, or something. For example a food billy deck will include the cards 7 Colored Fish, Bean Soldier, Hungry Burger, Jerry Beans Man, Mad Lobster, Marshmallon, Mushroom Man #2, Mystic Tomato, Sonic Duck, Terrorking Salmon, The Bistro Butcher, Emergency Provisions, Hamburger Recipe, Mystik Wok, Token Thanksgiving, Heavy Slump, Just Desserts, Pineapple Blast, Token Feastevil, Stim-Pack and Mooyan Curry.<br>  <br>  Actually besides making a billy deck you can just make a themed deck. Any deck is fun(E-Heros, D-Heros, Crystal Beast, Volcanics, Lightsworns, Tele-DAD etc)|`|cwrIZ95Vaa	ligthstomre or e-hero because they are fun to make and fun to play and you can win with them|`|4GMxqYDPaa	Crystal Beast Deck <br>  Its pretty funny watching the opponent lose to crappy attkand defence monsters

obPSaYf3aa	These bowling balls are basically from the late 80's and early 90's when urethane bowling ball coverstocks started to hit the market.  From what I remember, I'd guess that the Ebonite Turbo X (possibly x-out), Columbia 300 Pirahna/C and the Hammer (depending on what color it is) were selling for $75 to $110 retail at pro shops and the plain "Columbia 300" ball could have been either the "white dot", "yellow dot" or "blue dot" plastic/polyester spare balls retailing for $50 to $60 retail.<br>  <br>  There was really nothing different with the coverstocks except for either being glossy or sanded down.  The Turbo X had a two piece core, the Pirahna/C meant it had their patented ceramic core and the Hammer had it's own two piece design core.  The Columbia 300 ball probably had a round generic core since it's possibly a spare ball.
DtbdY5ccaa	You are knitting from the bottom of the leg to the crotch.  after you are done with your increases and you are satisfied with the the length, you would knit 3 rows in stockinette (knit 1 row, purl 1 row.)  ON THE NEXT ROW, bind off the first 2 stitches, finish the row.  Bind off the first 2 stitches on the next row and complete the row.<br>  <br>  This will give you a little extra fullness in the crotch when you sew up the inseam.<br>  <br>  Good luck - very cute pattern!|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	I think it would mean bind off the first two stitches on the last two rows.

"Ohhh the ps3 has better graphics"<br>  <br>  Please take into account that a PS3 does not have enough enhanced graphics to be visible to the naked eye. Why pay more? If you by a PS3 now, you also will not get Backwards Compatability, because Sony has taken it out, to better compete with Xbox (aka. they were losing money).<br>  <br>  Now to your question. An xbox elite looks pretty cool but in my opinion it is not worth the extra money (compared to a regular). If your friend likes Fantasy, Sport or Real-Time games, you shoulod definitly get an Xbox. If you like Racing or FPS games you should stay with your PS3.|`|CqB2wYyzaa	he is probably crazy if he doesnt like the ps3 he must be weird and ungrateful|`|EYjhQjgZaa	yes its way better, ya u may have to pay for live but alot more games and i think more people play xbox live.|`|OzE3reDMaa	ps3 is garbage.<br>  360 pwns.<br>  Yes he should buy it.|`|XX0ac9iRaa	The difference between the range of games for the PS3 and Xbox 360 at the moment are not that high,although the PS3s graphic capabilities are noticeably better. A good advantage of the PS3 is the free online service, whereas Xbox Live is charged for (not sure the cost in America). However, in my experience the online community of Xbox seems to be a lot more fun. I personally prefer the Xbox, but if your friend already has a PS3 then there's not much point changing, unless he has a really strong urge to play Fable II or Left 4 Dead (both of which I can highly recommend!)|`|fJViDuR2aa	Xbox360 elites are frigging awesome... he should totally buy one. I'm setting up to buy one right now... every time I play a friend's 360 I always wish I had one. don't get me wrong I like PS3s too but the 360s have way better and more variety of games. You know how many people play xbox live allot and it's only like less than 10 dollars a month... So I personally would go with the 360. It' his/her choice, make the right one...|`|5Pc9qi2Caa	Its his choice but I would say he should stick with his Playstation 3.

DtkLsetkaa	Go for a swim in the river north of Megaton, thats usually the fastest way.  Kill the mirelurks in it then walk away and let your radiation go up.  Also, I *highly* suggest getting the optional 600 rads, you get a bonus to regenerate your limbs if you ever get serious rad poisoning, which you just might, and its helpful to have.  Good luck!!!|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	You could go out a ways to where there's a river and go for a swim but it's 1 rad point per 1 second I believe so it's a little slow [good if you're swimming to rivet city]<br>  <br>  Drink from the irratiated water under/around the megaton bomb.<br>  <br>  Use the toilets [either male or female washrooms].<br>  <br>  Drinking from the irratiated water source under the bomb is the fastest I find.  Easy to get to 600 and back to Moira quick.|`|LDChWlW2aa	you should go down to the pond that the atomic bomb is in, stand in the water next to the bomb, and continually drink the water untill you get the messege that the objective AND the bonus objective has been completed. id definately go with doing the bonus objective because you get sort of a "power". if you have already blown up Megaton for that tenpeny tower dude, then just find a river (there is one near that supermart place) and do it there. hope i helped!|`|63faPpJaaa	An even quicker way of doing it than drinking or eating for a while is this. In Megaton is a rather large bomb right in the middle of the crater. Just go and stand next to the bomb and your rads wil go up and up. Thats how I did it and it took no time at all. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps :)|`|KU5SB6Tlaa	You can drink water from a spigot or sink in the world, you can sit in the pond in megaton (by the bomb) for awhile, you can eat a bunch of food, you can go into the world and find a river or lake and stand in it.  These are the easiest ways to get radiated.|`|ZJjdur9Waa	Drink the water by the atom bomb in the middle of town gives 18 rads a drink and 2 rads a second while standing in the water. Get 600 rads and you get a very helpful mutation. Good luck with the awsoeme game =P!|`|XX0ac9iRaa	Easiest way- go to the toilet in Megaton either in your house or the restrooms. Drinking the water  from it gives you 10 rads per second, it will take less than a minute to get the level up to where it needs to be and you don't even have to leave town. (kind of disgusting, but there you go...)|`|TZrlhyCDaa	get plenty of heavily radiated food and eat it all. dirty water is best. also just stand in the little puddle where the bomb is in town for a while. eventually it will get up there.|`|wpUaxn82aa	Go near the top of Megaton near moirtiy's bar. There should be a men's toilets. Go inside, and keep drinking from the toilet bowl. <br>  I recommend you go for the optional and get 600 RADS, you get a perk.

It froze a couple of times on me when i would walk outside from a house, and other times the enemies would be stuck inside the walls haha, but it was entertaining to me lol.|`|uoREpIvXaa	fallout <br>  <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/420-Fallout-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/v...</a><br>  <br>  Oblivion <br>  <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/75-Oblivion" rel="nofollow">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/v...</a><br>  <br>  I personally go out with fallout more fun :-)|`|7BGyTzjeaa	Fallout's good but I prefer Oblivion. It's a more interesting game in general. The type of gameplay suits Oblivion better then Fallout.|`|XX0ac9iRaa	I would say that Fallout 3 is easily the better game, but might not be the best choice. <br>  I was faced with the same dilemna recently and I chose Fallout 3. I completed that within a few weeks and then I bought Oblivion as well. Now, I've heard great things about this game from people who loved it, but I was constantly comparing it to Fallout (it is very similar in gameplay and style, only less well orchestrated), so I couldn't enjoy it. Put simply, it's like having a great big, delicious hamburger to eat, then following it with an apple. There's nothing wrong with the apple, the apple would be delicious on its own, but you're going to compare it to how good the hamburger was.<br>  Basically, if you want to fully enjoy both games, I'd recommend buying Oblivion, the weaker game, first, and then appreciate how improved Fallout is. If you only want one game though, Fallout 3 is the best choice.|`|bah9gVzKaa	Fallout 3 and Oblivion are very similar games (as they are made by the same people) both are very good oblivion is much more colourful and i would say more interesting due to the larger amount of cities and people, however Fallout 3 is newer and the guns make for more varied gameplay it is dark and has much less people in it i wud buy Fallout 3 simply as they are equally good games but it is newer although i am sure you wud not feel dissapointed if you got oblivion<br>  hope this helps|`|4NEIPjESaa	definantly fallout 3 because it has better weapons because it actually has guns and i think the creatures are cooler and the followers you can get are really helpful and its kinda easy to level up and it is fun to just explore and not do the main quest. oh yah and you make really cool weapons|`|bZztdwczaa	Honestly you should try Oblivion first, see if you get into it, if so, awhile later buy Fallout, a lot of people, myself included think that Fallout is basically the same game, just a different setting, which makes oblivion more of a first choice game.|`|H8uCYaCaaa	fallout 3, i love that game spent like 60hours on it
w7WYG9vaaa	1. Yes, simply because they say the F-word and while it may not seem bloody to you, it seems bloody to other people and they swear lol.<br>  2.Yes, End War is a RTS game based on the same kind of gameplay but more in the future (alot more! lol)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkxJFnT5emU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkxJFnT5e...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go55jBKaj80" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go55jBKaj...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB4LowYxt5o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB4LowYxt...</a><br>  3. No, the latest battlefield game to come out is Battlefield Heroes wich is based i think on WWII and will come out April 2009<br>  4. Because people want their games to be very bloody to enhance the "war realism" to make it seem as real, gory as possible.<br>  Ok bear with me heres what i know.<br>  Call of duty 6, announced by activision(hurra!) is actually going to be called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and will come out fall (probably November 11 cause thats when every other call of duty game has come out) and it WILL BE AWESOME. I think this game will be awesome anyways because it is made by infinity war and not treyarch. not much more to tell you but i would gladly update you as soon as i find more stuff out!|`|3m7jJQlwaa	i believe its Call of Duty 5: Modern Warfare 2|`|tD915UQ7aa	I can only answer number 4.  People are obssessed with realism, especially in games that deal with war.  To depict realism in war it requires lots of blood, violence, and some language to try and pull off the feeling of war.  All of these factor in to the Mature rating.
TkvG0s2laa	I got WoW for Christmas in the year 2004. My friend got it at release and showed me the game. I had never played an MMO before so i thought it looked cool so I told him i would get it. <br>  I have been playing WoW ever since. I still have tons of time to devote to playing. I actually have more time to play now since I went to college, though I am a terrible student.<br>  <br>  I plan to continue playing as long as possible, or as long as I still like the game. <br>  <br>  I defiantly hate my friend for getting me addicted to this evil evil game. =P|`|X6ABZvqAaa	In 2006 my friend was talking to someone who played as a Undead on World of Warcraft, two weeks later i was sat next to him in class and asked about the game, he told me afew stuff about the game - sounded cool - i went and bought it, the next day i had the time of my life with the 3 hours it took me to get my account setup and install the game. 3 years later, ive left school and had 3 level 70's a level 80 and a twink worth 3000 gold. I played on Quel Thalas, Alliance and started to PVP for some epic gear, then soon after me and my guild frequently raided end game instances, Black Temple to name one.<br>  <br>  I sold my account afew weeks ago for $350.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	It's sort of like Zelda, but it has RPG elements.  <br>  <br>  Story is basically about a girl name Ellen and a journalist name Keats.  She gets a letter from her dead mom telling her to meet her in Ireland.  Keats gets a phone call from a female saying that faeries are trying to kill her, and to meet her in Ireland.  They both go to Ireland, and when they get their, they see a figure and it runs away.  Ellen chases after the figure and when she gets to the beach, she runs into a little girl.  Ellen starts questioning the little girl, and then Ellen faints.  Keats arrives, and they decide to bring Ellen back to the village.  At night, they hear a voice telling them to go to the village pub.  At the pub, they meet strange creatures and are invited to the Netherworld.  Villagers start getting murdered, so it's up to Ellen and Keats to solve the murder mystery and unveil Ellen's past.<br>  <br>  It's a fun action RPG.  The only complaint I have is the shaking of the Sixaxis to extract an enemy's soul.  It's get rather old rather fast.
rcPnnfmmaa	Everything.<br>  <br>  The single most useful thing you can put in a guild vault is gems and enchants. That way if your new chest piece drops from Four Horsemen you can run back to Dalaran and, with the vault keeper's permission, have it ready to wear in under two minutes.<br>  <br>  Also, flasks. If your guild is raiding they will want lots and lots of flasks. Leave some in there.<br>  <br>  Lastly, BoE equipment and disenchanted BoP gear. This stockpile exists for gearing up new characters or people who have recently respecialized in a hurry.<br>  <br>  There will also be a fair amount of crafting materials. The herbs needed by alchemists for flasks, the uncut gems, the magic shards and essences.<br>  <br>  Lastly, patterns. If a leatherworking pattern drops for you and you don't make leather gear put it in the guild vault.<br>  <br>  You will also have to decide how access to this stockpile will work. My guild is very communistic; we don't always pay money for what we withdraw. However there's an understanding that if one BoE epic disappears something else of equal value will be depositied. If a flask goes away some lichbloom should take it's place. If you have nothing of value then you deposit half an item's estimated worth in gold into the bank. If you want something crafted by a guildmember it's *always* free if you can contribute the materials to make it.<br>  <br>  Barter-based communism works well for my raiding guild. Everyone gets what they need and the guild vault is more full than empty.|`|B1gSrhCnaa	probably cloth, a couple tabards, food/water, potions...<br>  bandages if people use them|`|a2ba4be746681f93bc35fe00ef232558aa	Honestly, it depends on the type of guild you are running.<br>  <br>  IF it is a leveling guild:<br>  Tons of low level-high level cloth, pots, patterns, etc to help your friends and guildies level their professions(especially things like the pages from Stranglethorn)<br>  <br>  IF it is a raiding guild:<br>  High level gems/enchants/BoE gear<br>  A suggestion for getting said things is requiring x number of non-usable things in heroics/raids to be DE'd to help supply the guild bank, as well as searching teh AH for cheap patterns which you could use the guild funs for.<br>  <br>  IF it is a PVP guild:<br>  Similar to PvE...but stock up on things like Kharma's Grace, maybe flasks and pots for pre-mades, mats to make things like netherweave nets, or expendable flares, etc.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, just remember, you will need contributions from your members to have a successful guild bank. :P

However if you live in America, it will come out two days later on the 5th. Japan released it in Novemver, and is the only place selling it around the world at the moment. The Nintedo DSi can hold MP3 tracks, photos, it has 2! webcams/cameras and can hold a SD card. Sadly games such as the R$ do not work on this, and you cannot get games such as guitar hero, which has a hand strap, the Nintedo DSi is too thin to hold one of these. The NIntendo DSi costs arund ￡130 - ￡150, although as I am English and live in teh UK I am not sure how much that is in dollars or whatever money you use. Suggest using a money compare sight.

There always is.<br>  <br>  As to which company will be first to release a new one, no one knows yet.  Right now, the only things that are coming out are upgrades to existing hardware (the Nintendo DSi and the PSP 3000).  They're not new systems... they're just improved versions of the older ones (although to be honest, the DS Lite and PSP 2000 are really the better systems).<br>  <br>  Current consoles have a minimum of 3 years left in them, though.  It's expensive to develop them, so companies like to get their money's worth before they release something new.|`|1O6bbqplaa	dsi this april. psp 300 soon. that's really all for now, maybe in 2011 or something, more will come out.
aXXTHpHBaa	yea|`|Wzws8v8daa	yes you can but you have to have their friend code and you have to visit their town or have them visit your town once before you can start sending letters.<br>  if you're looking for fruit.. you can send letters to each neighbor in your town with a gift attached to it (i usually put a seashell or piece of fruit) and they almost always send you a letter back with a gift attached and sometimes it will be a piece of foreign fruit. i got peaches, cherries and pears that way|`|EuVXErjJaa	If you want to get the other fruits you can send mail to the neighbors in your town. That's what I did and I got received all of the fruit I need with in a couple days. I sent every neighbor a letter with a native fruit or seashell in it all I wrote in the letter was "you are my friend" <br>  <br>  It may take a few tries but it should work. <br>  <br>  To travel to other towns you don't need to be close to the other persons house as long as you have the nintendo wifi set up. All you would need to do is exchange friend codes with someone. You get a friend code by talking to one of the dogs at the gate. That same guard will also help you open and close your gate when you want to go out or have someone come over.

a2ba4be746681f93bc35fe00ef232558aa	I would run EoE 10/25 and Naxx 25 to gear up the weapons of your raiders mainly. Personally, as a hunter with the T7.5(which isnt too hot anymore) and the Naxx guna nd EoE polearm, I pull around 5.3-5.8k dps, with 6.4k being the theory crafted with no lag. The raid dps needs to be more around 4k each if you can...sure makes things a lot easier.

55af249bb5f54fd89b8e0bf0ee8ac8b9aa	The 6370 is a good machine.  It's non-computerized, all mechanical (this is good); the model itself is nearly 30 years old.<br>  <br>  The 6000 line of Vikings has had some issues (as have all machines over time).  They mostly revolve around stuck controls or stitch selector cam issues.<br>  <br>  Because the lubrication used in the control knobs for this line (the stitch width, stitch length, and stitch selector), they may become "stuck" or non-responsive.  If this has happened, then the machine may only sew in reverse or it may be very difficult to rotate the controls.<br>  <br>  If you unscrew the back of the machine and use a hair dryer to gently heat things up inside, you'll probably be able to "unstick" things.  After that, just be sure to turn the controls about once a month to keep them from sticking again.<br>  <br>  Cam issues are a little more serious.  First, the "pegs" on the cams (little drum looking things with three pegs on the back) are often broken off on older cams.  If the cam doesn't have all three pegs, DON'T USE IT!  It may harm your machine.<br>  <br>  Next, the camshaft may be cracked.  The machine will continue to operate, but will not be able to sew embellishment stitches selected with the cams (each cam providing 4 stitches).  You can tell this because no matter what pattern you select, the machine will only sew a zig-zag.<br>  <br>  This requires a new part to be fixed.  It would cost about $200 to $250 for a sewing machine shop to do it ... but you can do it yourself if you're handy.  I believe the part itself runs about $80.<br>  <br>  Don't want to scare you away -- the 6370 is a strong, sturdy and reliable machine.  All machines can have problems over time -- these two issues are just the ones most commonly associated with the 6000 line of Viking machines -- I think they're most often due to neglect rather than machine deficiencies.a<br>  <br>  Note that the 6370 has a "low-speed/high-torque" selector that's really nice if you're sewing a lot of layers of denim.|`|0WASp0bHaa	I am not familiar with that model, but all Viking machines are good. I have had mine for over 10 years. <br>  <br>  When sewing on demin and leather make sure to use a needle for those fabrics. There is one out just for demin and just for leather. <br>  <br>  I have sewn leather on my Viking with no problems

My fiance works 3rd shift (from 10pm to 8:30am) and the only way he can make it the whole night, is if he takes a 3-4 hour nap before he goes to work.<br>  <br>  As far as any foods or drinks, they won't help long-term.  Even if you took a RedBull for example, it will wear off.  When your body wants to sleep, it will sleep, trust me.

n6NthDxwaa	Do you think your fiance is lying or what? My mother had the same experience w/ it being her and her best friend, tried to warn me off, but as a typical teenager back then, I knew better. Wrong. It really comes down to if you are willing to put you and your family in harms way. You don't know what kind of spirits your going to get a response from, and therefore wouldn't advise doing it in your home if you decide to persue it.|`|AA12253707	It's actually Ouija board and no I wouldn't put any faith in those things|`|EwcAR5bwaa	it's fake. there is no such thing as spirits|`|IxNQwrKYaa	There is a popular belief that an Ouija board has some inherent power, or that spirits live inside the board or planchette. This is not correct. The Ouija board is simply a board with letters, numbers, a few words, and copyright and/or patent information, and the planchette is a small inert device that has been designed to move easily across the board. There is nothing magic or mysterious about the board or planchette themselves, and the mere presence of such devices will not cause paranormal events to occur.<br>  <br>  The board's power comes from the calling forth of spirits. The participant(s) get(s) the attention of these spirits and ask(s) them questions, whereupon the spirits respond by moving the planchette around on the board. Many people believe a person can call forth the spirit of someone who has passed on, or some other specific entity, but this has never been proven, to my knowledge. The spirit(s) who are summoned will often not have any singular identity at all.<br>  <br>  Those spirits who do have identities will usually be vague, evasive or misleading about their names. This is because knowing their names can give the experienced summoner power over the spirits themselves, and the spirits can then be forced to do things they don't want to do. This is very undesirable to the spirits, of course, who want to keep their liberty and freedom intact.<br>  <br>  The spirits who are summoned in this way are never good ones. Good spirits will not respond to this type of summoning. Sometimes the spirits who are summoned are neutral or mischievous, and will often simply give random answers to participants' questions.<br>  <br>  Other spirits may be more powerful than these, and may actually have limited knowledge they may impart. However, these spirits are nearly always malevolent, and when summoned they may decide to take residence in the room or household where they are summoned. Sometimes they will even take residence in the participants themselves! Once they have taken residence, they can manifest themselves in our world of reality in real and very frightening, and in some cases very destructive, ways.<br>  <br>  Depending on the power of these malevolent beings, one may be able to drive them out in a variety of ways. These spirits are very legalistic, however, and some of them may have the power to take up permanent residence in the room, household or person they have elected to haunt.<br>  <br>  These spirits can only be gotten rid of by identifying the source of their right to be wherever they are, renouncing this right, and flooding the host with good spirits. They can then be forced to flee. Very powerful evil spirits may be difficult to exorcise even in this manner, but it is the only manner that has been proven to be successful.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this is the way you get rid of the malevolent spirits once you have them. You cannot prevent their permanent residence by any means, whether by religious icons, garlic, holy water, or whatever, because the actual calling forth of spirits is what gives them the right to stay. The calling of the spirits will override any preventive measures you could use to prevent their permanent residence.<br>  <br>  If you do call forth spirits to manipulate objects in the real world and divulge information, you are asking for trouble. My advice is, DON'T! No information received in this way is worth the potential risk of possession by evil spirits. Many lives have been completely destroyed in this way. Please, don't let this happen to you. If you are tempted to use divination devices to call forth spirits, get rid of them. Your life will be much better for it. - LJS|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Stay away from them, they are dangerous.<br>  And it's spelled "ouija".|`|MvisyrRVaa	If you are an open minded individual you will try it and give it a chance.

They were both cheap so i wasnt to sure about either of them, mirrors edge is first person, full of free running, its awesome, but its very short. Assassins creed is massive, but quite repetitive. COD5 is a better game than mirrors edge but less original, they're all quality though|`|7PNnv8Asaa	hey dont waste your money on mirrors edge. if i were you, stick to assasins creed, then maybe move to call of duty, world at war.

c5W2Q6qKaa	You're just imagining it.|`|jxpV13rTaa	there is no effect like that..i sometimes have problems with that same deal,.you shoot someon multiple times and they dont die. when it happens, look at your connection. everytime it has happened to me i have had the lowest connection (one bar). so that is your problem. it has nothing to do with the presitge mode.|`|idrRW9M7aa	It has no effect at all.  When you do prestige you lose all unlocked weapons and power ups and you get a different logo thingy.  I think that you've played for a while and now are just good.|`|2p4w7EPnaa	I feel the same way. I think that after you prestige for the first time and you're going back to the original perks and guns, you feel that maybe the original perks/guns would work better then the ones you used before. For example, I really liked satchel charges but now I prefer bouncing bettys. I also seem to do better with semi automatic rifles then I do with fully automatic rifles. Basically, for me prestige opened up oppritunities for guns and perks I did not want to use.<br>  <br>  Also... for some reason enemies seem to go for higher number ranks and ignore me first, in my case several times. xD|`|997O8CkQaa	hmmm, ive prestiged 6 times and nothing has changed for me, maybe all of a sudden you got better?<br>  <br>  all i see is that prestige is a vanity thing and not worth it to anyone except the elite CoD gamers that just want to look cool|`|UbRtV8QQaa	no way it doesnt effect it i am 3 prestige all it does is gain respect from other players|`|pGoNUM8maa	No, your prestige has no affect on how good your character is. However in COD WAW it does give you extra classes. But there is no change in gameplay.|`|pQF8JAsDaa	Prestige no affect at all. you may get more respect from other players seeing you're prestige

8u3b6ONHaa	Go around to various other people in your town who are walking around. When you talk to them a couple of times they will ask you if you want to play a game. If you win the game they will give you a piece of candy(red, yellow, blue, or green). Sometimes you can pick what color you want, other times they just give you whatever. In order to play the games though you will have to trade either 500 bells or a piece of candy. BTW Pave requires 3 of each kind to get a piece of furniture which he trades you in exchange for the candy.

I'm afraid you are going to have to look it up on your own though.|`|daHSlMFUaa	there's an anti-piracy thing that's blocking you from getting off the ship. that means if your game is not the official cartridge, the game will sense it and you'll not be able to get off the ship and after a while you'll simply get a "thanks for playing" message.<br>  <br>  there are bypass action replay codes around...just look for it

2Q2ltt1Saa	You need to have the most recent dashboard update (the NXE) to use it.  It's the one with the avatars and the panes are "hovering" on the screen in front of/behind each other, not filling the entire screen.<br>  <br>  Provided you have that, you can insert a game into the drive and then go to the My XBox / Play pane, hit Y, and save to hard drive.<br>  <br>  When you start a hard-drive stored game, it still requires the game in the DVD drive and checks to make sure it's there; this prevents sharing games and/or rent/install/return.|`|BpXbNjEpaa	The first thing you need is the NXE update.  If you can make avatars, etc., you're good to go there.<br>  When the disk in in the XBox, there will be an option in the My Games section of the menu to download it to the hard drive.  <br>  This doesn't allow you to simply rent and download games, though, since it still requires you to insert the disk to verify ownership.<br>  It improves the loading times on a lot of games, and cuts down on noise from the console.<br>  <br>  Here's a chart that lists a lot of the differences for specific games:<br>  <a href="http://www.bingegamer.net/2008/so-how-much-time-are-you-saving-xbox-360-nxe-hard-drive-install-chart/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bingegamer.net/2008/so-how-mu...</a>|`|XiZWW4Fqaa	You need to go to the "My Xbox" section of the 360 and then to "Games Library" with the game you want to download in the system. Select the option to save/install game to hard drive.<br>  <br>  You will still need the disc to play the game, but this improves the graphics, loading times, and helps prevent freezes during game play.|`|ExYwvcqvaa	yes you can download games ti the hard drive but the games run slower and look worse. and they take up a lot of space on the hard drive. but yes you could rent and download them to the hard drive.  but since you dont have live you havent gotten the update so idk if you can do it without the update.|`|KTlrqbTBaa	You can't play games unless the disc is in the tray so saving it to the harddrive does nothing!

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  Here's what the 'Empire: Total War Special Forces Edition' includes:<br>  <br>  * A beautifully decorated campaign map, game manual and CD's to play.<br>  * 6 bonus units - The Ottoman Organ Gun, Bulkeley's Regiment, HMS Victory, Rogers' Rangers, Corso Terrestre Guerillas and Ghoorkas.<br>  * If you pre-order you will get another additional feature! One of three elite units: Either USS Constitution, Deaths' Head Hussars or Dahomey Amazons.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  If you pre-order the normal version you receive:<br>  <br>  * The game manual and CD's.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  The cost of "Empire: Total War Special Forces"  varies widely, depending on the game store you buy it from. Your decision really comes down to how cheap you can purhcase 'Special Forces' for. I'm planning to order my copy for a measly $10.00 Australian extra, so it's a great deal for me. However, not all retailers will be as generous with their pricing. You may find it to be a blatant rip-off. In the end the choice is yours, just be wise and weigh up the benefits in accordance with payment.|`|c5W2Q6qKaa	If you want to buy an extra faction for $30, that's your choice. <br>  <br>  To be honest, I think you'll get just a much enjoyment out of the original than the special.|`|n2udSL3saa	in my opinion i wouldn't buy it i had it and found it dull and a time waster but he is right the original is better and cheaper

yf0tevyfaa	Okay here are some of my suggestions.<br>  <br>  I used to be in this guild that had tabard contests. Anyone who wanted to compete could and what they would do is use an online tabard generator to make up their idea of a new guild tabard. They would give like two weeks to submit your tabard and then have a guild vote on which one they wanted. Whoever's tabard was picked, the person would be awarded 100g, or whatever you can afford.<br>  <br>  Also my guild that I'm in does raid, but also sets aside 1 hour a week to lower levels. We had a problem with the higher levels not helping out lower levels, so my guild leader made it mandatory that officers give an hour a week to help out. You don't have to make it mandatory, but it's something to help ALL levels in the guild out, not just the high levels.<br>  <br>  If you're going to set out a recruiting macro, welcome low levels. That way, you can work on helping them out in the beginning and leveling. That way, when they do get to a higher level, they can help you out, or help out newer low levels.<br>  <br>  When you post your macro in the guild recruitment channel, make it clear that the guild is for leveling, casual chat, and FUN. I know lots of people in wow play seriously, but a lot of other people also play for fun and don't want a strict guild.<br>  <br>  You could also do a weekly drawing for lower levels. IF you are a higher level, you could do a drawing where once a week a low level gets the chance to get a FREE INSTANCE RUN from you. <br>  <br>  To gain money for the guild bank, you could also establish that in the instance run, they can have ALL bind on pickup items, and can keep all of their highest armor type. Say if they are a rogue, they can have all leather items, and so on, but you get to keep all cloth, mail and plate items.<br>  <br>  Just because you aren't a raiding guild doesn't mean you can't run lower level instances. Set up instance runs that go with the majority of the levels of characters in your guild. Say if most of the people in your guild are level 25, schedule a gnomeregan or Wailing Caverns run for Saturday at 7 realm time.<br>  <br>  It's no biggie if no one shows up, but it at least gives them an option of running an instance without having to find a group on their own.<br>  <br>  Now that Blizzard has given WoW achievements, you can set up achievement groups to get together and achieve all of those achievements that you can't do alone.<br>  <br>  Mention all of the extra activities that your guild holds in your macro in order to attract different types of players. The more people you attract, the busier your guild will be.<br>  <br>  Later on if you want, when a lot of people are leveled up, you can start running heroics and getting gear to start a more serious raiding guild. <br>  <br>  Good luck  (:|`|YCqnmsrFaa	Make a macro and every 5-10 minutes send it in general when you are training and when in cities- send it in trade and invite everyone without a guild and be active and fun people will want to stay|`|2Q2ltt1Saa	Guilds on WoW are so fluid; there's nothing that keeps someone there other than friends, really.  If you absolutely have to run a guild, then you'll have to find people that are willing to help from the ground up (and let them know this when they join); otherwise, disband it and tell your friends to join whatever guild you find that is more established and has a better player base.|`|MSST8jNlaa	Sorry to say this but, you need to do raids and other guild activities to attract members. Try doing guild contests also.|`|aDMAtfqZaa	UGH|`|i0J7K5Txaa	After four years of this game I think I can answer your question effectively.<br>  <br>  Do nonstop heroics, get your reputation with players up, make friends, gear up with decent things.  Your reputation with the community is the key, be friendly, do not spam, be personal when recruiting, message some one that's guild-less and start a conversation with them, build up to your hook for invite.<br>  <br>  Another method is to let anyone invite anyone, not the best method, as it can get bad apples quickly.<br>  <br>  Just make sure your guild is secure, do not give access to the bank for random people.  Do not promote people frequently, they should be earned not given.  Do not constantly run people through things, it will burn you out on the game, they will become 'spoon fed' and earn/learn nothing.  Everyone does need help some times though, like class dungeon quest, etc.<br>  <br>  I hope that information helps, I've ran many guilds, been officers, been low ranking.  If you like this information you can contanct me on more key ideas you have questions about, as I do not want to give everyone reading a head ache with to much information.  Good luck, have fun.

Which doing so is very very bad because some plants could let out hazardous toxins when burned and inhaled.The reason why weed (Cannabis) has the affect it has is because it produces TetraHydraCannibinal (THC). Only plants in that species produce that. Catnip comes form an entirely different species so it will not produce same results as weed. Hence why the DEA does not bust in and confiscate cat nip plants or any other plants other than marijuana because they do not produce the same results when burned and inhaled.|`|SkB9i5pwaa	There's a television program on "Spike" TV called: "Manswers".

I have a firm belief that such a device would go a long way towards wiping out the kind of dreadful people who go to Theme Parks.|`|H2qEN27daa	I don't know what my rollercoaster would be called but I know I would be awesome. I'd want the train to go up the lift hill upside down!,  have tons of loops and heartline rolls, be partially over water and when you're near the water on the ride to feel the breeze/mist of the water (ie- Hulk coaster at IOA), definitely have it go through a tunnel of fog (Superman Ride of Steel- SFNE), and have it light up at night! =D|`|SmFcDx4waa	it would be like a giant marbleworks game.... you know - this sort of game...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babyfactoryusa.com/images/BigImages/9496_250.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyfactoryusa.com/images/Big...</a><br>  <br>  the seats would be inside a giant ball, and you would free roll down tubes and stuff...it would be awesome....and you could even have multiple paths the ball could take (just like the game) since it is not on a specific track, each time you ride could be a different experience....|`|eBzi2VPjaa	i would create a roller coaster that was the fastest roller coaster that only goes backwards. i would call it Aiden|`|hmjAwZQEaa	it would be called the crusader. it would be vr and you would be on a helicopter carrying out high speed strafe runs on middle eastern villages|`|AA10328947	My ride would be called "THE SLAPPER"  and i would charge you ￡50 to ride the slapper, and maybe more for extras.|`|3onySMD6aa	its fast but goes upside down, spins, drops bacwards and you can choose what speed you want (different ride but sime style but different speeds)

ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  I have some sites listed below that you may wish to take a look at...there are quite a few things available.  Hope they help!
5mkap5x7aa	Most of them don't work anymore but they are releasing new multiplayer maps and one new nazi zombie mode so im sure there will be new glitches.
XChiSgDZaa	smarty pants is a fun ones, super monkey ball, mario and sonic olympic games|`|sxpklh7jaa	thanerosse is right. resident evil 4 is definately the best game on wii to date. but you dont seem the type to want to play that.... so get brawl|`|SnTBokvyaa	Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games is really really addicting!<br>  I love it|`|uAMUG0xaaa	Super Smash Brothers Brawl is pretty fun. I've had it for a while, but haven't played it lately. But it's really fun. It's a fighting game, but no gore<br>  and it's pretty easy once you figure out the buttons. You can play with 4<br>  different control types. You can use the classic controller use for virtual<br>  console games, a gamecube controller, or the regular wii remote and<br>  wii remote nunchuk. I wouldn't advise just wii remote with no nunchuk though. It's probably pretty cheap by now if you can find it new. There<br>  are 35 characters once you've unlocked them all, and its pretty easy<br>  to unlock quite a few by just playing story mode.|`|039HpR4Saa	Uhhhhhhh...well, being an expert on both games "wink wink" I suggest getting whichever costs more and mentioning it to your friends so that a certain someone would be able to buy you the one that costs less as a belated birthday present "hint hint". Or if they cost the same buy the one which you will play more often...I would have to say that is Sims Animals. Anyway, you could also just buy both because I wouldn't expect to get that belated birthday present until your next birthday since i doubt I'm going to the game store anytime soon. Oops, gave it away...ooo I sound so cheap, but they are expensive, I should know. haha|`|3G7Lpah5aa	Wii Music is more of a game for the whole family. If that is what you are looking for then that's my suggestion. Sims Animals is a game that I'm not too familiar with. Judging on what I've seen with the other Sims games I'm sure it is a great game that people of all ages can enjoy. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped!<br>  Good luck with your decision!!|`|GWha8Hz3aa	I have heard that both those games arent that good. If you want a music game rock band 2 is the best one|`|XX0ac9iRaa	It depends if you have any sense of taste in games at all. If you enjoyed the likes of Wii Play then I'd go for whatever is the latest Nintendo poopfest. I've heard people enjoy Wii Music... which is frankly quite embarassing.<br>  If, however, you're looking for a GOOD game, I recommend Okami, which is original and fun, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess or Super Smash Bros Brawl. I would recommend Resident Evil 4 as well, but you don't really seem the type for that... ^_^|`|PZYu8no7aa	The best game is super smash brawl. Get it it is very addictive also Mario party.|`|dKyi5MLKaa	don't get wii music its rubbish in my opinion but try the Guinness book of world records game or mario and sonic at the olympics|`|v9azP3EUaa	We have this awesome game called Kabooki - its like that cranium board game but on wii, a little confusing at times lol but really fun|`|ciG5yrgFaa	i have fun with wario ware!  it's simple, but hilarious and fun!
7Ca2ns47aa	Nope. The Deluxe edition already has the original, along with the Nightlife expansion and the Celebration Stuff pack.|`|GWha8Hz3aa	I bought the sims deluxe edition in the store without ever owning a sims game and it worked|`|kBBFbTPiaa	no<br>  <br>  me friend has the delux and you dont
cXX8iDDNaa	Depends what expirience your after<br>  Gears 2 takes single player, but the multiplayer is lacking compared to Gears 1.<br>  Halo 3 on the other hand has excellent multiplayer, but some find the single player a tad dull.|`|4hvh9bCdaa	Gears of war 2 (GoW2) and Halo 3 are to totally differnt games. Ill break them both down for you. Halo 3 is a first person shooter and his limited gore and no vulgar language. The story mode in Halo 3 is quite easy even on the most difficult game mode. The campaign mode in Halo 3 is also quite short and require no challenge to beat. If playing on xbox live the games are very good.<br>  <br>  Gears of war 2, this game is a 3rd person shooter. In GoW 2 there are intense sences of violence , gore, and vulgar lanuage. Who doesnt like a game where every other world is a F-bomb. The story mode in gears of war 2 is quite long and very challengeing espically in the insane mode. While playing on xbox live you might become frustarated with games that you get lagged out on becuase the Epic Servers arent every good and have a "In Game Host" which means the host has a advantage and if the Host quits the game end.<br>  <br>  I personally think GoW2 is a much better game then Halo 3 and you should rent both games before you buy 1 of them.|`|wL7ZEkp7aa	Gears 2 has a Awesome campaign and an ok multi player- it is for hardcore gamers<br>  <br>  Halo 3 ok campaign and an Awesome multiplayer- it is more casual than gears 2<br>  <br>  I find myself getting mad at gears 2 more than halo just because it is more intense<br>  <br>  halo 3 is more like a socializing game to me.|`|ovgBPDmhaa	gears 2 definetly! but try getting the first one b4 the second one because you wont really understand it unless you have the first one glad i could hlp|`|rW8L2OW0aa	halo 3 all the way it is voted officially better than gears by xbox mag|`|gXfwKch4aa	I say halo 3. The online multiplayer is one of the best i've seen on the xbox 360.|`|tGXpyhrpaa	Gears, because CoD4 is a brilliant FPS.|`|2xpzhN5faa	Gears of war 2.<br>  It is way better than halo.|`|BJIo6twUaa	i would say gears of war 2.<br>  <br>  But if you like to do muiltiplayer, you may enjoy Halo 3 a bit more. The single player story line was short. So i wasnt too happy with Halo 3 since i do do any of the xbox live stuff.|`|D1u46O1Oaa	i would get gear of war 2<br>  <br>  but there are way better games than does games like assassins creed<br>  mirrors edge and bioshock<br>  there all good and u may get call of duty any of them <br>  <br>  dont belive people who says xbox 360 is **** <br>  cause i had myn for 2 years and it still works perfect does people who sas it brakes in a year over heats its engine dont play it alot and check if the cabels are right pluged in cause u can get a ring of death if one misis out<br>  it nealy hapend to me.|`|URxNcgAaaa	Get halo gears of war is terrible. Well, for me. Halo 3 is more of an online game though. Really good stuff in halo too. I absolutely hated gears of war 1 and 2. 3 and 4 are pretty good. But if you want gears of war get the first one then the second. Hope this helps|`|2p4w7EPnaa	Gears 2.<br>  <br>  Halo 3 gets boring reallllly fast. The campaign is short, and multiplayer is kind of the same. Shoot a few bullets, whack.<br>  <br>  Gears of War 2 has a good campaign and multiplayer.|`|tAEdJSGcaa	Halo 3 all the way trust me GOW2 sucks on utiplayer and lacks on hd on single player
SyhJAPSnaa	GTA IV probs|`|2jL5Tw9Waa	I would have to say Call of Duty world at war. <br>  then gta4

AAgX0SDcaa	wool is a good warm fabric, fleece and other fuzzy fabrics, almost any fabric that will hold a little air between you and the fabric.|`|POXOqhOYaa	The Snuggie, of course.<br>  They say it will keep you completely warm but has anyone noticed there's a big gapping hole in the bag to slide into it, how warm can that get?|`|fVAApgMXaa	What people have already answered is correct, but there's a few others too. <br>  <br>  Of natural fiber fabrics, wool is warmest.  It even tops down, which of course is a feather, not a fiber.  Wool is warmest because not only is it a naturally undulating strand (meaning it allows air to be trapped next to the skin) but also it stays warm when wet.  A rain-soaked down jacket will whip away core heat; you’ll freeze in a damp wet cotton, linen or silk fabric, but you could work outside all day in the rain and still be warm in wool.  I know, did it for years.<br>  <br>  Besides wool (& feathers), I’d vote next for manufactured materials such as Thinsulate (man-made insulation, thin & light with the properties of down), it’s great to quilt with to make a fashion garment very warm. It's found in off the rack jackets, but also sold as yardage, already quilted or as batting (various weights).<br>  <br>  In addition, layering clothing makes a big difference. Why? because the air trapped between the layers helps keep you warm.  Air-trapping "fuzzies" like fleece are usually warm, but if you're going into significant cold, seek out Performance Fleece as it is a significantly different product.  Consider those made by Malden Mills: Polartec  #300 (heaviest/warmest); the Power Shield series (has a nylon face); and Polartec Windblock (blocks 4x the wind of a traditional fleece fabric). These are available in ready-to-wear and by the yard for home sewers. <br>  <br>  I like wicking fabrics that have a capillary action, that is they transfer moisture away from the body; therefore have better insulating properties.  A fabric like cotton absorbs water and holds on to it, making you cold. <br>  <br>  Fabrics.net, "Not all Wools are Scratchy" <a href="http://www.fabrics.net/wool.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.fabrics.net/wool.asp</a><br>  <br>  Why settle for scratchy wool when there are so many kinds; read: “Guide to Wool”  <a href="http://www.sierratradingpost.com/lp2/wool-guide.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sierratradingpost.com/lp2/woo...</a> <br>  <br>  Sheep101: “why is wool warm?” <a href="http://www.sheep101.info/warmwool.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sheep101.info/warmwool.html</a><br>  <br>  PsychoVerical, “The wonders of Wool” <a href="http://www.psychovertical.com/?wool" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychovertical.com/?wool</a><br>  <br>  Survival Topics: Why is a (wool) hat important? <a href="http://www.survivaltopics.com/survival/always-carry-a-warm-hat/" rel="nofollow">http://www.survivaltopics.com/survival/a...</a><br>  <br>  Book: “All About Wool”  <a href="http://www.raincitypublishing.com/allaboutwool.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.raincitypublishing.com/allabo...</a> <br>  <br>  Polartec fabrics by the yard (Malden Mills) <a href="http://www.milldirecttextiles.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.milldirecttextiles.com/</a> <br>  <br>  “Wicking Fabrics, the Base Layer”  <a href="http://www.icebike.org/Articles/fabrics.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.icebike.org/Articles/fabrics....</a><br>  <br>  Seattle Fabrics: <a href="http://www.seattlefabrics.com/outerwear.html#Polartec?%20Power%20Shield" rel="nofollow">http://www.seattlefabrics.com/outerwear....</a>|`|432f9a03ef86ae8ea15283268639ddb8aa	Wool and silk both trap heat well, and most synthetics, too.

qbmkMWqeaa	You can't return it just because you don't like it. <br>  <br>  For example, say you buy a used DS Lite for $89. 2 days later you find that you don't like it so you return it. Gamestop will take it back as used and give you about $40-$60 credit.  This is the same policy as if you bought it new...<br>  <br>  Maybe you should call gamestop and ask them what thier policy is...

h2PrC1rPaa	Iunno, I personally think that they are two totally different games. Controls on most FPS games are similar usually.|`|0e5b67e3dc34535b99485801f1216192aa	I see no resemblance between the two games with the exception of them being FPS games.  FEAR 2 is a horror game, COD4 is a war simulation featuring real life weapons and scenarios.  FEAR allows you to bend time, COD4 doesn't, again, because it's designed to simulate real battle scenarios.<br>  <br>  FEAR has similar looking scopes?  Duh, the scopes in both games look the same because they actually exist.  The ACOGS scopes and red-dot scopes are functional tactical gear.  "[I]t felt exactly like playing a substandard COD" is a silly statement because they shouldn't feel alike at all.<br>  FEAR features a "The Ring" or "Carrie" style story, featuring the para-normal.<br>  I suppose they're exactly the same if you consider that every FPS has a gun, you point and click and shoot and kill people.  Sorry, but you need to re-evaluate your assumptions about these games.|`|cXX8iDDNaa	Most of your points are to do with control schemes. The COD4 control scheme works, so it's bound other games will be influenced by it.<br>  <br>  As for the red dot sights. This is because they are actual sights used on real guns, it's just coincidental.<br>  <br>  And plus I've never seen any little girl following me in COD4!

e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	If you are learning, it's best to buy a preconstructed deck and read the rules.  Once you have the rules down, you also have a deck to build from.  Starter decks usually are based around a theme and they limit the good cards and put in some ok cards, so you can then look online for the cards you really want if they are available.  Also, there are only 2 rares in a starter deck.  If the rare cards are decent in the deck, you might want to pick up more, so it might be better to search for them either online or at a card shop that sells single cards.  Now, once you get the hang of tweaking a deck, you can look at the cards available and ask question on ebay.  The site allows you to ask questions of the seller, like how many are commons, uncommons, rare cards.  Most shops that sell bundles online will tell you it's a random assortment with usually so many commons, uncommons, and rares.  Five hundred cards is a good starter set, don't get me wrong.  When just needing cards is a key thing, it's a good deal, but once you start building a deck, you want to be able to get your hands on specifically what you need.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped|`|n5TYFgETaa	i recommend buying a starter deck rather than random cards.  the 500 card set might help you cobble one together, but it may not really work very well.|`|My65doewaa	Go to a hobby/card shop, ask around for people to teach you how to play.  Most people at those kind of places will have a lot of "junk" cards and are usually pretty friendly, and may actually build a free deck for you.  It will probably be all commons, but it will work to learn with.<br>  <br>  You are also going to need land, which you can probably get people to give you.  If not, you want to buy start packs for a bit.|`|r8j0Fglgaa	Basing it on quantity, it's a much better deal to get the 500 cards for $10 on eBay.  If you wanted to build a deck, I think you'd wind up spending a lot more on boosters than $10.  I bought a Magic the Gathering Starter Pack a while back at Target for $15, I think.  But I'd probably go with the cards on eBay.<br>  <br>  Still, the guy above me has a point.  You probably could get better cards from booster packs.|`|f896fb2755e9ba1bf76a0ecfb72d8128aa	The 500 cards for $10 might be all common cards, with no uncommons or rares in the bunch. If so, you'd probably be better off buying some boosters. The uncommons and rares are needed in order to give your deck a bit of extra oomph.<br>  <br>  It's possible that the ebay cards include the regular proportion of "good cards". If so, that's the way to go - but you don't know that.|`|CEchFOhqaa	Go to a store that sells singles and explain your new and want to get a cheap fun deck to play. They will help you build one and typically at a good price. Buying packs is never the way to go. Typically you wont get cards worth what the pack costs you. Find the cards you want and them buy them as singles or set on ebay or some other site. It's almost always a better deal.|`|9a86050106d7cf4536dec7d92656cfa6aa	Neither scenario is good for a new comer who wants to build a deck because you have to have land.  You need your deck to be at least 60 cards, with 40 percent being land.  That means you need at least 24 lands.  If the 500 lot auction indeed has basic lands, then it is not worth 10 bucks.<br>  <br>  If you buy boosters you MAY get one land per pack but you'd have to buy a ton of boosters.<br>  <br>  I suggest you buy a preconstructed deck (aka Theme deck).  I am selling both these and a booster box (36 boosters) on ebay right now if you are interested:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/merchant/blacklotuseaters" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.com/merchant/blacklotus...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  (and remember, you could get the complete playset (all cards times 4) of commons and uncommons for most editions for under 12.00)

Just because the guy is into karate - even as much as he sounds like he is - doesn't mean that he has no other interests.  If I were you and I wanted this to happen, I'd give him a call and invite him somewhere.  Don't do anything that is too long, like a movie. . .  maybe a burger or a coffee.  If that time won't work for him, ask him to call you when he can figure out a time and day.  Tell him you're looking forward to it and leave it at that.

Yw1k1W19aa	There are tarot cards that have the French suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades), however, these are, to my knowledge, only really used to play games with. Tarot cards were originally invented for games, with the French suits becoming the dominant form in Europe during the 18th century - the old Italian designs are still used for game play in Italy, Sicily, and Switzerland.<br>  <br>  There are a couple of European sites that sell French suited tarot:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.playingcardsales.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.playingcardsales.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.alidastore.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alidastore.com</a><br>  <br>  There is a US bases site with an excellent selection:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tarobearslair.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tarobearslair.com</a><br>  <br>  You can also find some galleries of French suited cards, along with links to stores where you can buy them - and some advice on purchasing from French traders on eBay at my own site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tarocchino.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tarocchino.com</a><br>  <br>  However, that you talk of fortune teller's cards suggests that you don't mean tarot. There are a number of packs, usually called oracles, that are essentially a 36 card pack of French suited playing cards with some pictures on them to suggest meanings for Fortune telling. You can find examples of these at the two European stores mentioned above.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how useful they will be to your boyfriend - but I do think the games of tarot (still played throughout continental Europe) are a lot more fun than Poker.|`|GL95xSFXaa	I'm not too sure where you can find ones with aces, hearts, clubs and diamonds.

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	No, due to light reflecting from the coin. It needs to be seen so it can be turned and looked at with some magnification. Most coins in lower grades such as very fine and below can be ball parked by a photo, but high grade coins need to be seen. You must also remember a grade given to a coin even by a Professional grader is still only his opinion at the time he graded it. There are always others who will disagree. Get a copy of ANA grading standards or the new Whitman guide to grading which is easier to use. A coin collector must learn to grade at least circulated coins. Hope this helps|`|41d4ea7f37805161606a19c751c1961caa	The short answer is no. The proper amount of detail to grade a coin just is not available through an email photo and the conditions under which the photo in taken can greatly influence the way a coin looks in a photo. Other elements of grading such as eye appeal, depth of luster and color of the coin are not easily assessable with a photo either.  You can get a general idea of a grade but no one would be willing to certify or guarantee a grade based on a photo. <br>  <br>  Books with grading guidelines and a lot of experience is the best way to grade a coin properly.|`|ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  Try either of the sites listed below.

zVTFWI9iaa	If I remeber right from design school, the DEPTH takes into account the stomach and ease of movement when the wearer sits/stands. These motions have to be accounted for, or you would split your pants when you sat down! (lol) The length is uses to calculate the RISE or distance between the 4 seams that come together at the crotch and the top of the pants/waistband. These also come into play with movement...you would risk falling out of your pants when you stood up, or went to reach for something. These measurements are important when you consider wear, or how the pants are intended to be used (formal vs casual, for example) or what material the pants woud be made from (knit vs woven, for example). Both measurements used together make comfortable, dependable pants.<br>  I hope I helped...that was a VERY good question!!|`|6N3yjlXhaa	Taking the measurement from the side as you are sitting (depth), does take into account stomach or tush measurements (length).<br>  <br>  More information here - <a href="http://www.simplicity.com/index.cfm?page=section/fittips/fitpant.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.simplicity.com/index.cfm?page...</a>

lylTrAbEaa	Get the dsi. It comes out april5th and can be preordered now for 169.00.|`|2dya7YeKaa	The original DS (the DS Fat as it is jokingly called) isn't availible for purchase brand new anymore, you would have to buy it used.  That would be your cheapest option.  <br>  <br>  The DSi isn't going to be out in the States for a while yet and when it does come out it is going to be more pricey than the DS Lite.  If you want to save up the money, I'd wait.  The DSi is going to be a better deal (it has an SD slot for crying out loud) but if you don't want to wait, get an old DS Fat used from Gamestop or something.|`|1lewFV8oaa	I really like the DS lite.  I bought one on launch day.  The DSI will be a good system, but I do not want to lose the ability to play my GBA games.|`|mkyXGgGxaa	WAIT TIL DA DSI COMES OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|Y7dsUhQXaa	wait till the dsi comes out|`|6VGMPkFDaa	ds lite.|`|nT5kc4Qiaa	I'd say get the regular DS. The DSi is out of the question because it doesnt come out until april. The ds lite is a little bit slimmer and is a different color and is more expensive than the regular ds. I say just get the regular DS.|`|JXXnywF3aa	The DS lite. I have one and they are cool.
kzlgy2uGaa	i have all of that for sale, plus all of the minor lightsworn monsters and spells, make me an offer?<br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>  the new banlist is out, lightsworn is top, zombies and teledad is dead|`|L2qk1wheaa	jd and charge are likely to take the konami's ocg exclusives and both go to 1, if u buy it now it will be a waste of time, just wait a week or 2 and find out the new banlist before trading for pile of expensive cards =) (o_o)
7IALuA2haa	This is a pretty good team.8/10 for a start.But soon you should start getting legendaries.<br>  My team is <br>  <br>  Arceus:Judgment,Thunder,Fly,Draco Meteor<br>  Darkrai:Dark Void,Dark Pulse,Focus Punch,Dream Eater<br>  Deoxys:Zap Cannon,Psycho Boost,Shadow Ball,Super Power<br>  Kyogre:Sheer Cold,Ice beam,Earthquake,Hydro Pump<br>  Lugia:Aero Blast,Psycho Boost,Ice Beam,Hydro Pump<br>  Mewtwo:Psychic,Shadow Ball,Earthquake,Aura Sphere<br>  <br>  This is my team.It is NOT HACKED|`|Pw1y449Daa	Ok your pokemon teams are good, but just change the moves around a bit:<br>  <br>  Infernape (Physical Attacker):<br>  Close Combat/Brick Break (Powerful)<br>  Flare Blitz/Blaze Kick (Powerful)               <br>  Shadow Claw/Thunderpunch (Depends if you want to fight psychic or water)<br>  Stone Edge (For fighting flying)<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Infernape (Special Attacker):<br>  Heat Wave (Powerful, hits both opponents)<br>  Hidden Power Dark/Ghost (For fighting psychic)<br>  Grass Knot (For fighting water, ground)<br>  Overheat/Blast Burn (Final finishing touch)<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Staraptor:<br>  Close Combat (For fighting rock, ice)<br>  Steel Wing (For fighting rock, ice - May boost defense)<br>  Brave Bird (Powerful)<br>  Aerial Ace (For fighting pokemon using double team, minimize, etc)<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Gyarados:<br>  Stone Edge (Powerful)<br>  Earthquake (For fighting electric, rock)<br>  Ice Fang (May flinch and/or freeze the foe)<br>  Aqua Tail/Waterfall (For fighting rock)<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Mismagius:<br>  Pain Split (You gain HP, the foe loses half HP)<br>  Dark Pulse (For fighting ghost)<br>  Hidden Power Bug/Fighting (For fighting dark)<br>  Energy Ball/Psychic (Powerful)<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Garchomp:<br>  Stone Edge (For fighting ice)<br>  Earthquake (Powerful)<br>  Dragon Claw/Dragon Rush (For fighting dragon)<br>  Crunch/Brick Break/Aerial Ace (Powerful)<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Roserade:<br>  Leaf Storm (Powerful)<br>  Extrasensory (Powerful)<br>  Shadow Ball (For fighting psychic)<br>  Hidden Power Rock (For fighting fire, flying, ice)<br>  <br>  I like using japanese names for my pokemon<br>  <br>  I would name the Roserade:<br>  Sakura<br>  Rozari<br>  Roza<br>  Rozen<br>  Rose<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|QJwaagGWaa	Ok, I will try.<br>  1.) Infernape- If I were you, I will go ahead and teach him Brick Break Already, if you have it, and that way, his fighting moves will definately destroy anything weak to fighting.   8/10<br>  2.) Staraptor- he has too many flying moves, and plus, he does not learn any diverse moves, since you already have a fire Pokemon, your Staraptor may not become much help, you could replace him for the time being, if not, then, i dont know....... 6/10<br>  3.) Gyarados- you can make it forget Surf, since he has a high Attack stat, and has two water moves, and teach him a move that can counter his weaknesses....... 8/10<br>  4.) Mismagius-  yeah, hurry up and replace the move or teach it Nasty Plot, to raise its Special Attack......... 8/10<br>  5.) Garchomp- he is good, you might want to teach him a fighting attack to counter some Ice Pokemon...... 8/10<br>  6.) Roserade (Rose?)- i dont know why having a lot of Grass moves is a good thing, but You could have taught her the move Grasswhistle, just for the extra fun :) 7/10<br>  <br>  Overall a nice team, a few move changes and some replacements might make this team even better! 7.5/10<br>  <br>  <br>  seriously, train your pokemon to at least Lv 60, because at level 53, you WILL have a hard time beating the Elite Four.|`|GobivjWGaa	thats a good team to use but take a lot of revives in case they die. you should first raise them p to 60 or 70. name your rosrade, Solar|`|vRMuydSCaa	roserade= beutiffuly magic|`|w4qS66aqaa	10/10 :]|`|vR8bN1n4aa	Dude, the only pokemon i recognize there is gyrados. That's pretty weak man. You need to get more oldschool pokemon, none of that >150 nonsense.<br>  <br>  Where's the Alakazam? That guy is awesome. You could probably beat the entire game with that one pokemon alone. Also, grass pokemon are terrible and a waste of space. Get some Dragonites instead, those guys rock hardcore.|`|jbAFsUyhaa	Dont go into the elite 4 your will lose 2nd or 3rd battle. Train your Infernape and Garchomp a lot more(high 60's/low 70's) i went into the elite 4 with a level 73 empoleon and Palkia and a bunch of stupid pokemon and beat it first try. Just train and you can get it. DONT GO IN YET. DO you want to know the team i went in with?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The pokemon i went with was <br>  Empoloen: Lvl 73 <br>  Palkia: 72<br>  Roserade: 50<br>  Garchomp: 50<br>  Azelf (spelling?): 60<br>  Gloom: 35 (HM SLAVE)<br>  <br>  Thats what i had, i mostly used my starter who just beat everything. Its moves were Grass Knot, Peck, Hydro Pump,and Surf. It beat every major type but doesnt have many weaknesses cause it steel.
Pw1y449Daa	Shiny pokemon arent better than ordinary pokemon. Their the same, they have the same stats. Its just that their color has changed, its just there to show off. So there really is no point for having a shiny pokemon.....unless for those people who go like "OMG I JUST CAUGHT A SHINY BIDOOF!!" LOOK LOOK!! SEE" and start showing off to everyone. But unless you catch a shiny pokemon with a good nature, then you have a very rare pokemon cuz you can train that pokemon well and max out some of its stats, while it is a shiny pokemon!|`|jK7pklCKaa	they arnt, they are exactly the same as normal pokemon except the colour|`|qQil3tbnaa	They aren't any better then a normal Pokemon, they just look kind of cool.|`|C3HZRdYfaa	i noticed that even when i had leveled them up passed the point of how many badges i had, they always listened no matter what|`|VmGrypxVaa	There is no difference except for the opening scene with stars.
tBsMH9kGaa	$6? maybe less...|`|elY5vkVyaa	Depends how old they are, Tamagotchis have been around for years and there are newer versions. Or are they Neo-Pets?|`|n5TYFgETaa	Tamagochis?  Not too much, that fad is way over, I'd sell em for .75 cents

JEteneuUaa	I play game it fuehn! okay!|`|jK7pklCKaa	Basically your a lawyer who has to prove your clients innocence, there are 2 main modes in the game, investigation and the trial each is split into chapters. While this sounds like a stupid idea for a game it is extrmely well done and has a very compelling story and characters.|`|vR8bN1n4aa	Phoenix Wright games are pretty amazing, but not really from a gameplay perspective. You play the role of an attorney, and you try to defend various people that are accused of different crimes, mostly murders.<br>  <br>  Lots of looking at the screen and tapping things with the stylus. The gameplay isn't really the focus though. The story and characters in the game are portrayed pretty well, and it can be hard to put down as you'll want to know what happens next. Very suspenseful.<br>  <br>  I'm a fan of them.
5HfuI3MEaa	yes it says, on the back. and no, they dont.|`|nKXASKGhaa	yes<br>  just look
TMkhlCCTaa	I think you should go back to route 112 and catch a Numel to replace Zizagoon because it around the average level as the rest of your pokemon and it is strong against a lot of types and not weak for very many and if you train it right it can evolve into a Camerupt.  Then just wait to get rid of the Slakoth till later in the game.<br>  <br>  Edit--to get Combusken up to 36 and it will evolve into Blaziken and be sure to teach it fighting moves you'll have to fight other trainers and then you can fight Flannery.|`|97Hnt7Ywaa	Well it is a decent team.  But the last 2 must be trained more, you can also EV train them if you like.  You can also replace the Slakoth when you are traveling, as for battle you have to fill in Slakoth's spot if you are willing to battle; not travel.|`|RRswnh9Jaa	It's ok but you need to get them higher leveled like 40  and up.|`|DtAyFqASaa	Yep 100%|`|8hvUyaStaa	Well it is a decent team. But the last 2 must be trained more, you can also EV train them if you like. You can also replace the Slakoth when you are traveling, as for battle you have to fill in Slakoth's spot if you are willing to battle; not travel.

aSq7YLzEaa	well if you find it fun, do it I think the best way to play WoW and keep a social life is not to join a raiding guild, cause then you can play anytime you want and not stress on when you have to be on. So if it makes you happy it should be worth it, classes any class if fun, its all about what you think.|`|6eQXBGXVaa	what is wow|`|dKsQktrjaa	Dont go back to it. yes it will hurt your social life, and you will probobly prefer to play WoW than go out with your girlfriend. DONT PLAY WOW|`|an2KyFI8aa	The answers are in you... But... In my point of view I think you shouldn't if you are sixteen or more... <br>  <br>  If you can control your brain, your actions, you'll know when play WoW and when go out with friends o girlfriend... the nyou should...<br>  <br>  :).... Please don't go back... look at me!... I can't stop playing wow... and my friends always are talking about play it... hehe...<br>  <br>  All depends of you, and the "social" life in what you are...|`|ItleV9qeaa	no u just have to know when to turn off the game<br>  rouge seems pretty cool thats what id go with but the shaman is stronger<br>  well if ur bored u have to do something to keep urself busy u just have to know when to stop playing is all<br>  now time to tell u about my WoW experience it all started........(o i fell asleep on myself)|`|PQy6if0Waa	Get your GF to start playing it. You both shall live in the realm of Warcraft, be bound together, and be destined to an unhealthy lifestyle! You two shall be together, from beginning to end! You two will conquer the troubles that cover all of Warcraft, let nothing stand in the way of LOVE, for love knows no end! Oh, such a beautiful thing!|`|kthrNyAdaa	well here is the thing, im glad to hear you have a social life.<br>  <br>  i play WoW nearly everyday however, i have a beautiful fiancee, a well taken care of dog, a full time job, real life friends, a truck that im making payments on.  my point is that i do have a social life and WoW at the same time.<br>  <br>  if you start playing again, avoid the Death Knights for now, everyone is playing with them.  id suggest trying out a Druid, or a Paladin.  Paladins got some love in the last couple updates and since the expansion game out.<br>  <br>  it being worth it is up to you man.  if you think you will lose everything in your life because of WoW then dont do it.  if you think you will be able to do it moderately and enjoy time with your girl then why not, if you find the game enjoyable.  you might even try and see if she likes the game herself.  you would be surprised and you might have something that you two do toghether.<br>  <br>  well i hope it all works out for you,<br>  <br>  take it easy|`|SqaE5UGsaa	play it! i enjoy playing it every once in a while, lets say there's nothing on tv, or my friends and me decide not to go out, then i play wow for a while.|`|06jWWV6Haa	dun be, noob, play wow, get phat lootz and pew pew mobs<br>  <br>  Do both and enjoy it, wotlk is awesome and i hope you pwn noobs when 80.|`|KHwTlygtaa	don't play more then an hour a day. a gf(not ugly) is better then a videogame. ive never played the game so idk.|`|HANxrG6maa	wow is the root of all evil.<br>  i think thats enough said.|`|AA10674334	First things first, yes your social life would suffer if you don't keep things in perspective, just like anything else really. I believe that speaks for itself but needs to be said none-the-less.<br>  Secondly, I recently quit wow, I'm in college, and right now, money and time are tight, I do plan on eventually playing again but I can do with a break. That being said I apologize if what I say seems a bit biased.<br>  Third, they recently nerfed everything on rogues save Fan of Knives. If you're geared I've seen 7k dps on trash pulls, 4k on bosses. Pass on the rogue for now. Granted patch 3.1.0 is coming out soon, and I mean SOON. So this could change, I'll check up on the patch notes and update my answer if possible. Shamans were also nerfed, however; like I said this could change soon as well.<br>  For those who would like to know, Patch 3.1.0 is the release of the new level 80 raid, Ulduar, gear level T8 is also being released and it's being bought with different currency than T7.|`|ol3jUzpXaa	Play it as a, "ugh i got nothing to do for a few hours" insted of letting it take up all your time, bad idea, i seen it happen to alot of my friends<br>  Also, maybe next time your talking to your GF, lead the conversation towards video games and ask her opinion? Probably a dumb idea but hay, you never know<br>  <br>  As for which toon<br>  Shamans have received the ****-end of every patch so play your rogue, they getting buffed next big patch and they still kill in pvp, badly :)
MnEHO9u9aa	yes and theyre trying to make it " the best zelda game ever" miyamotos involved so idk..
pfUOkdahaa	You can modify your Xbox 360 controller for rapid fire on more of the guns and you can find the directions at www.instructables.com.|`|J1elZSMUaa	There was a whole bunch of glitchs, but they just released their second title update which got rid of most of them. Try searching google or youtube for an answer.
xDubataIaa	Get out of your gaming comfort zone and try something new and fresh. Try out genres which you have never gotten into. For example, I was losing interest in gaming at the time Halo 3 Call of Duty 4 came out. I guess I just got tired of shooters. On a whim decided to try out a music-rhythm game, Guitar Hero 3 to be exact. Never cared for the genre before but that game totally reignited my interest in gaming.<br>  <br>  Since then I have been trying out the some of the off-beat titles on the DS; Phoenix Wright, The World Ends with You, and Professor Layton to name a few. For the 360 I bought Braid and it was an amazing, albeit brief, experience. <br>  <br>  But like I said before, just try out different genres. Guitar Hero 3 proved to me that a game doesn't have to be totally original it just has to be fun and different than what you have been playing to get you back into gaming.|`|sagRnblNaa	Try Runescape or World of Warcraft. Play through all the Metal Gear Solids and Tomb Raiders. POKEMON IS GREAT LOL.
QXrl1cPUaa	You seem to be a big fan of shooters, particularly shooters with substantial amounts of online playability, so I'd recommend Left 4 Dead. It's a cooperative shooter that pits you against swarms of zombies in blasted urban wastelands. Online play is pretty tremendous, as you need to stick together to overcome the hordes. There are also competitive modes where you and opposing teams take turns playing as the bad guys. Based on your existing collection, it seems like a can't miss.|`|d0fa25b284e1f0b5318568250948279baa	I would say Call of Duty 4.

6EbDYWNEaa	I like the beach theme. Games your could play might be some sort of volley ball, the limbo, Frisbee, have hot dogs and hamburgers for food. drinks with little umbrellas in them, virgin daiquiris.<br>  <br>  I also like the mystery theme. You can do like a "Clue" board game theme and act out the game in real life. You can do an era, like a 50's mystery party so everyone can dress up and you can have sparkling white grape juice for champagne with dinner. <br>  <br>  Not that your 11 year old is like a play boy model, but there was a Girls Next Door episode where Bridgette had a murder mystery birthday party and it turned out really cool.

HFqiY6BGaa	sabotage! well in this situation it seems an eye for an eye is the best choice (and blatantly the most fun). why dont you take something from him of the same equal value and sell it for the cost of the memory stick. or take money. but he must not know. or you could take his homework out of his backpack without him looking. that is the best because 1. he wont know. 2. he will freak out when he cant find it. 3. the reaction is very good. 4. his stealing will affect his grades, haha.|`|FyFUvnCIaa	Don't beat the kid up!

GDKBqwwJaa	Is that an independent company that has stuff in Six Flags parks? I would call Six Flags HR and ask about it, they will most likely have a contact number. For the independent companies, like Kodak, that are at six flags, you don't apply through six flags, you apply through the company.

8vGq6cRTaa	Yes boy and girl BJDs with the same head size can share wigs.  However, not all 1/3 size dolls wears the same size wig.  Wigs are usually sold by head size in inches.  example a Size 9 wig would fit a 9-inch head best.  A size 9-10 would fit a 9.5-inch head best.  Any wig will fit a head that is a bit smaller or larger but some wigs stretch more than others.  (i.e. a 9-10 wig might have trouble stretching all the way to 10 and may be loose on a 9-inch head).  Here is how to measure for a wig:<br>  <a href="http://www.monique.com/howto.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.monique.com/howto.html</a><br>  <br>  Measure your doll's head, and if the wig has no stated sze then you need to know the head size of the doll it was meant for.  If you find that doll's head size in cm, divide by 2.54 for inches.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	Definitely, as long as their heads are in the same size range (e.g. 7-8 inch). Keep in mind that on some models, the girls' heads are slightly smaller than the boys' heads, so even if the boy and girl fall within the same size range the wig might fit them a little differently. I often find that wigs are just a bit tighter on my Luts Delf El (boy) than on my Luts Delf Miyu (girl) even though their heads are in the same size range.

nT5kc4Qiaa	Best gun you can get in CA is a g36e. It has a far sighted scope for long distance kills, low recoil so you're gonna be more accurate, and its cheaper than most other guns. It also has pretty good fire power. Its good in maps like snow valley.

KUcM5UDKaa	your level always comes before exp. as long as you get your level up, you'll be okay... some ranks require a certain level as well as exp, but if you get your highest level up, you can just go play a bunch of social games or the 2x exp playlist to get your exp up. rank is more important, so work up a good win streak to get it as high as you can.

bfa7fNK0aa	The simple card deck cut does not scramble the sequence of the cards. ( <a href="http://www.cardtrickcorner.com/Cutthedeck.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardtrickcorner.com/Cutthedec...</a> )<br>  <br>  Let say after the "black out" and "everybody scrambling around, the 16 cards become one pile with the sequence:<br>  1KingH - 2QueenH - 3JackH - 4AceH - 5KingS - 6QueenS - 7JackS - 8AceS - 9KingD - 10QueenD - 11JackD - 12AceD - 13KingC - 14QueenC - 15JackC - 16AceC<br>  <br>  If you cut the cards at 3JackH (Take 3 cards from the top and place the rest 13 cards on top of the 3 cards) the sequence would be:<br>  1AceH - 2KingS - 3QueenS - 4JackS - 5AceS - 6KingD - 7QueenD - 8JackD - 9AceD - 10KingC - 11QueenC - 12JackC - 13AceC -14KingH - 15QueenH - 16JackH<br>  <br>  The start of the sequence changes but does not scramble the whole sequence. See the 1st 5th 9th 13th are all Aces and the same with the rest. So if you draw the cards one by one into 4 piles, all 4 Aces would be on 1 pile and so the rest.<br>  <br>  Story make magic more entertaining.<br>  See another version of that card tricks at <a href="http://www.cardtrickcorner.com/CardParty.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardtrickcorner.com/CardParty...</a>|`|hUNWAeXbaa	Here ya go.

The best way to demonstrate it is to do the trick and cut the card facing up.  You will see that when you cut a deck the order is still in place.
e77d4af2a585abc3ccf7f5bbe20755f5aa	What about getting a basic black purse.  Take a red ribbon, like the one on the cover of the book, and tear and fray it.  Sew it around the purse like the book cover.
PGAKu4Mzaa	First off. Choose night time so dusk balls are more effective. Second some pokemon that can learn false swipe and hypnosis. That is so you can hit the pokemon without killing it and make it sleep.<br>  <br>  sneasel is good for it. if you cant find a sneasel, get kricketune. secondly get a pokemon with hypnosis. if you can find one with both or have both skills on 1 pokemon awesome for you. use the 1 or 2 pokemon for that battle. use false swipe when its life is yellow so you can get it to 1hp. then use hypnosis. it makes the pokemon catch way easier cause it became very week and asleep!|`|uAMUG0xaaa	well you actually can't catch EVERY pokemon that has ever been in every game in Diamond or Pearl version. You can either trade on wifi<br>  over GTSif you have it in your pokedex, or ask a friend that is in your<br>  Pal Pad for it on Wifi. The other way is to transfer pokemon from the<br>  Gameboy Advance pokemon games (firered,leafgreen,ruby,sapphire and <br>  emerald) into your Diamond or Pearl version. You must beat the Elite<br>  four and finish the national pokedex (150 pokemon, you just have to see<br>  them, not catch every single one) then go to a place called Pal Park and<br>  catch the pokemon you transferred there. If you just mean catch all the new legendaries, just use action replay to get 999 master balls. You also can only get 3 legendaries an action replay (Shaymin, Darkrai, and Arceus the coolest pokemon ever ^^ he's the Pokemon god ^^)|`|Qi3kJmZLaa	before taking it on, SAVE. You would have more than one chance in getting it. you could try throwing a few quick balls at first, or you could first weaken them with a pokemon about their level but not super effective to their type to low hp, when it is in the red zone. Then give it a status, like sleep or paralyze (but not damage-inflicting statuses, or it will die). then you should throw dusk balls at it for a few turns, and if the battle goes over fifteen turns, start throwing timer balls. KEEP TRYING!!! in another pokemon game, it took me three DAYS to catch mewtwo<br>  for pokemon that run away, have a fast pokemon that has scary face so that it cannot run away. then just keep on iflicting damage|`|rX11sgcWaa	patience.<br>  <br>  take a sychro pokemon so you can get the right nature on your legendaries since you only have one chance to catch them...|`|AHUCVcx8aa	Basically, you weaken it as far as you are comfortable with and throw lots of balls at it. You have to keep persevering,|`|Rr90QnpFaa	one out of every 40 pokeballs is the equavalent of 1 masterball|`|yQDNkb26aa	I would recommend catching either dialga or palkia with the master ball and then when it come to catching the others simply weaken it until they are in red HP and then make sure you stock up on the best balls available E.g. Ulta balls, timer balls, dusk balls as most of them you fight in a cave and i would also reccommend some heavy balls as most of the legendary pokemin are rediculasly heavy hope that helps :)|`|XX0ac9iRaa	My tactic was to use a Pokemon which was a lot more powerful than the legendary pokemon but not effective against it. That way, you should be able to take out most of its health with one or two hits without knocking it out. It comes in use if you have a strong Sneasel or Wavile; they can learn False Swipe, a very useful move as it cannot knock out the Pokemon and will always leave it with at least 1 HP. It also helps to put it to sleep or paralyze it if you can. You'll need at least 30 ultra balls, and also as the battle goes on timer balls are particularly useful. Even if the Pokemon keeps breaking free, the more balls you throw at it the weaker it gets. You should eventually capture the Pokemon. And I really don't need to mention the importance of saving beforehand do I?|`|F4jwf6Kcaa	i would use timer balls<br>  and for pokemon like azelf that <br>  run away use pokemon that hav arena trap|`|hbiwUQpgaa	weaken them up then put them to sleep<br>  use a dark ball|`|KHwTlygtaa	get lucky

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	In most cases, you'll need both CD keys if you want to play again.<br>  <br>  One way to find out is to uninstall Frozen Throne and see if you can play.  If you can't play, then both it's likely that both keys got banned.|`|6fQCODKRaa	Actuality, you might not be banned.  If you try to log in and it says "Unable to connect to Bnet, this maybe an invalid server, or if you are using a modem or dial-up, you may have to manually connect to the Internet before playing."  The message is something like this.  Anyway, if that is your message you ARE NOT CD key banned.  Blizzard doesn't ban CD keys either, they perm IP ban, but do not ban CD keys.  If you are IP banned, and do not get this message, then buying a new game won't do any good.<br>  <br>  To answer your actual question, you need both CD's in order to play on the Frozen Throne, but just one if you only play RoC.

Turn up the brightness.<br>  <br>  Fright is all about dim light and being alone.  If you can counter those, then it won't be as scary.<br>  <br>  I remember that answer.  Wasn't it like months ago?|`|i7TTejCEaa	if something in the game scares you, or makes you jump, or whatever, think about something funny about the situation, and have a good laugh about it with your mates.... just remember the scary stuff is only a game :)|`|MvmJBDJ3aa	well maybe if u werent a cry baby and listened to the guy who said dont play rated m games it might help|`|2ezj28u1aa	just play it in daylight or have someone next to you while playing it.i kno its scary i played it too|`|MnEHO9u9aa	heres an idea- stop playing rated M games then|`|DGqeGQoIaa	when you go to play it just remind yourself that it's just a game.or have a friend with you when you play.its a good game but it's not too scary.it's more creepy than anything else.

w4qS66aqaa	i suggest re-downloading pokemon pearl to your action replay
5APcsaCfaa	You need to plug in an HDMI cable from the ps3 to a TV that has high definition.  Thats what I have and its great.

tCZkiYpgaa	I can copy and paste the images into another folder and then upload them from there, but they are only thumbnail sized. Is that the same problem?|`|2ezj28u1aa	idk|`|RQzsmvfiaa	I have never played The Sims 2, but I guess you can just push PrintScreen on your keyboard.
RQzsmvfiaa	Sorry you do not have the 40 or 60GB PlayStation 3. I feel sorry for you. They will never release an emulator for the PS3 that allows you to play PS2. Sony thought of it as a mistake when they did so for 40/60GB systems. <br>  <br>  The only way to play God of War 2 is to buy a PlayStation 2. Maybe you can install a PS2 emulator on a good computer.... maybe!|`|KpxZFTBfaa	They should make the trilogy of god of war. All the games that have three sequels make trilogys but it will be a while after god of war3 comes out for them to make one. And i have a 80gb ps3 and god of war 2 i was able to play it on mine without problems.|`|tCkcBwgbaa	sorry, no, but lol, funny question|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	There's a possibility that Sony will make PS2 games downloadable on PSN, and you can bet that one of the first few games available for download will be God of War 1 & 2.<br>  <br>  As it stands right now, there's no way.  Don't you have some friends that have a PS2 and God 2?  Borrow from them.
1T35X8dEaa	try posting on the Quest boards located under the Neoboards<br>  <br>  If you post that you are looking for a "Happy chia Mask" someone will post the prices and usernames of those that have them in their shops.
