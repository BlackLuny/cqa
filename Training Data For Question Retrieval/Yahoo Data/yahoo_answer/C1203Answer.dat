haxC4WdYaa	Teachers are trying to confuse you :) Forget goldie, forget speed swimmer and forget that it is a circular pond because that is only there to confuse you. Only focus on the numbers.    Imagine you are in a car, say your older brother is driving you and look at the speed he is going and you see he is driving at 35 miles per hour - that means if he keeps going at that speed you will travel 35 miles.     Say a road is 0.5 miles long, think of it that way. So if it takes her 2 whole hours to travel a 0.5 mile road 20 times back and forth (20 laps in this case, same thing) that means in two hours she traveled 10 miles, right? If you don't get it, read it again from the top.     The formula for speed is (Speed = Distance divided by time) So we divide distance, which is the 10 miles that she traveled, by time, which is the 2 hours that it took her to travel that distance .... and our answer is 5 mph :) Her average speed is 5 mph!     So say if your friend's house is 10 miles down the road, it would take you 2 hours to get there if you walked at 5mph right?     How long would it take you to get there if you ran at 10mph? I'll let you answer that :)    Good luck!

ZlX0CuuXaa	First, isolate the absolute value by dividing both sides by 4.    |5x - 1| = 9    Then, you have to make two equations since the absolute value could be equal to negative nine or positive nine, so you'll have two answers. *The absolute value is gone from this point on.    First equation:  5x - 1 = 9  5x = 10  x = 2    Second equation:  5x - 1 = -9  5x = -8  x = -8/5

JUmfm168aa	Hello,    The domain of your function y is simply x (not equal to) 1/3.    This is because you cannot divide by zero, so 3x - 1 cannot be zero.    I would presume also that your x will be real, giving domain:  x is real, x is not equal to 1/3.    A domain would be all-real for many functions, the most obvious of which being trigonometric ones; you couldn't take the sine of an imaginary number, for instance.    Real positive number domains are slightly more tricky, but imagine the function y = sqrt(x). x must be real to have a real root, and x must be positive, since negatives have imaginary roots.|`|oFtVXmz4aa	domain 3x - 1 not equal 0---> x not = 1/3  Domain = R\ {1/3}

bsvwAn3laa	There are two ways you can graph to find the correct point. you can either find the x and y intercepts of each equation to graph or set it to y= mx+b form to graph. I like to change it to slope intercept form, If you change it to y=mx+b form you will be more accurate becuase you are able to graph more points because you have the slope.    SO for the first one if you put it in y=mx + b form you should get  y= 3/2x + 8  and y= -3/2x -10    Your y intercept for the first one is (0, 8) and from the point you can make several other points with the slope by going up three right two or down three left two.  Your y intercept for the second equation is (0, -10) and from that point you can use the slope -3/2 to plot more points. go down 3 right 2 or up 3 left 2.  With this you should find an intersecting point.  the others should work the same way. If you need any help with slope, or understanding y intercept form add it to your question and i can help you.

hHVMrnK3aa	These look like algebra to me.    What you do is apply the principle which says:    "If you do the same operation (add, sub, mult, div)   to each side of an equation, the equality is preserved."    This is also sometimes stated as  "Equals added (etc.) to equals are equal."    So for the first one, you can divide both sides by 3:  3p / 3 = 4 / 3  cancel the 3's on the left, and voila: p = 4/3    For number three, you multiply by a on both sides.  (leave the 2 behind, you'll need it over there)  Then divide by 21.    Number four takes two steps: first add 4 to both sides  3p - 4 + 4 = 8 + 4  3p = 12  Then divide by 3    Last one is also two steps:  1. Divide by 2  2. subtract 3    After you have some practice, you take shortcuts:    x + 4 = 8  rather than x + 4 - 4 = 8 - 4  and then x + 0 = 4  and then x = 4  you "magically" fly the 4 across the equals sign,  changing its sign along the way:  x = 8 - 4 = 4

Now let,s look at the problem. First Curly    digs a pool 14by 40. This is going to be  the interior boundary of the deck. Next comes the deck. The deck will be six feet wide all the way around the pool. Add six feet on both ends and six feet on both sides.   The1352 was for the deck and pool. To find the deck alone multiply  14*40=560; to find the area of the deck and pool multiply 26*52=1325.    Subtract1325-560=765 sq. ft.

U6RV17Bzaa	This problem is a setup.  Namely, there is an extremely convenient substitution you can use.    Let u = arcsin((4/6)x).  Consequently:  du = (dx * 4/6) /  sqrt( 1 - ((4/6)x)^2 ) = 4dx / sqrt(36 - 16x^2)    Isn't that pretty?  You can take it from there.

bsvwAn3laa	You do the same thing to find the min and the max. you have to find the vertex of the equation. (h, k) (the h is another fancy letter for x value and k for y (h,k) corresponds to (x, y))  You need to know that y=ax^2 + bx +c is represented in these two equations.  The k value of (h,k) represents the min or max     To do this use the formula h= -b/2a to find the h value  SO for the first one 80 is the b value so the opposite value of 80 is -80. -8 is the a value so you times that by 2 and have -16 You put -80/-16 which equals POSITIVE 5. this is your h value. You need this to find the k which is the max.  The k is easy to find with the h. You simply plug in 5 where all the x's are.  k= -8(5)^2 +80(5) -196  k= 4    Do the same steps to find the min of the second one. No quadratic equation can have both a max and a min which is why you can do the same steps    If you have any other questions you can add it to this question and I'll help you

Instead, you start by getting a common denominator:  22/30 - 5 15/30    Now you are going to get a negative number, so if you just think of reversing the subtraction and taking the negative, you should get the same answer:  -(5 15/30 - 22/30)    Okay, but now you can't subtract 22/30 from 15/30, so you need to "borrow" 30/30)  -(4 45/30 - 22/30)    Notice how you made the 5 into 4 and then added another 30/30.

ixzVKzBjaa	6(x2-3x-10)  6(x+2)(x-5)|`|qRxIl7ojaa	So the first step we'll take is to factor out a 6 because it is the common factor in all terms.    6 [ x^2 - 3x - 10 ]    Now we have to factor what's in the brackets. Here's one approach:    6 [ (x - 5) ( x + 2) ]    Both 2 and 5 are factors of 10 and if we multiply this out again, we'll see the same function.    6 [ x^2 + 2x - 5x - 10 ] ==> 6 [ x^2 - 3x - 10 ]  6x^2 - 18x - 60    This means that we got it right.  The answer is:  6 [ (x - 5) (x + 2) ]    Hope this helps!!

You should use the equation y-y1=m(x-x1)    Where x and y are variables. M is the slope, y1=1, and x1=-4.    Since the slope is perp to -3/2 the slope of this line is the opposite reciprocal.    Therefore m=-1/(-3/2)=2/3    So all you have to do is plug in the numbers    y-1=2/3(x+4)    y-1=2x/3+8/3    y=2x/3+11/3
239bf03f74eeaad4c18a8972abf502cdaa	Let  y = 0[ a(n)?x? ]   Then the first two derivates of y are:  y' = 1[ n?a(n)?x??1 ]   y'' = 2[ n?(n-1)?a(n)?x??2 ]     Because the higher order terms vanish for x=0, you can find the first two coefficients from the given initial condition:  y(0) = 1 => a(0) = 1  y'(0) = 0 => a(1) = 0    Then substitute the series into the differential equation in order to get a recursion formula for the other coefficients:    y'' + x?y = 0    2[ n?(n-1)?a(n)?x??2 ] + x?0[ a(n)?x? ] = 0    2[ n?(n-1)?a(n)?x??2 ] + 0[ a(n)?x??1 ] = 0  Shift the indexes such you get two series with x? as argument.    0[ (n+2)?(n+1)?a(n+2)?x? ]  +  1[ a(n-1)?x? ] = 0  The term x? does not appear in second series. Therefore factor out this from of the first sum in order to series os same length:    2?a(2) + 1[ (n+2)?(n+1)?a(n+2)?x? ] + 1[ a(n-1)?x? ] = 0    2?a(2) + 1[ ((n+2)?(n+1)?a(n+2) + a(n-1) ) ? x? ] = 0    Because this equation must hold for any value of x, the coefficient of each power of x needs to be zero. That requires that:  1. a(2) = 0  2. ((n+2)?(n+1)?a(n+2) + a(n-1) = 0    second condition can be written as  a(n+2) = -a(n-1) / ( (n+2)?(n+1) )  or  a(n) = -a(n-3) / ( n?(n-1) )  which is desired recursion formula    With a(0)=1 and a(1)=a(2)=0 you can calculate all the other coefficients:  a(0) = 1  a(1) = a(2) = 0  a(3) = -a(0) / (3?2) = -1/6  a(4) = -a(1) / (4?3) = 0  a(5) = -a(2) / (5?4) = 0  a(6) = -a(3) / (6?5) = 1/180  a(7) = -a(4) / (7?6) = 0  a(8) = -a(5) / (8?7) = 0  a(9) = -a(6) / (9?8) = -1/12960  ...    =>    y = 1 - (1/6)?x3 + (1/180)?x? - (1/12960)?x? + ...

Therefore, no!!!|`|22c9f866b1f51599fe8ce2db97ba57d3aa	The question isn't speed, it is volume, but the answer is still no.    Immense volume sent into a black hole will make it larger, more massive, and capable of absorbing even more.  So, the more you send in, the more it can absorb.    Now, objects certainly can go around a black hole, either in orbit, or in a spiral inward, thus giving the appearance of a flush.  The speed and volume of the object will affect how that spiral looks.    If an object is REALLY massive (more massive than the black hole), the black hole will be absorbed into it.  In the end, this can have various effects.  The entire object may be absorbed by the black hole, or if the object is large enough, bits of it may orbit and swirl around the black hole.  However, this effect is not constrained by the mass of the object, but by the size, speed, and density.  A similar effect can be achieved by a smaller object that "just barely misses" the black hole.|`|Aty76cgqaa	You can always tell when a jerkoff from the religion category comes out for a breath of fresh air.

Das liegt daran, dass ein Transformator durch "Induktion" den Strom unwandelt, das hei?t, der Transformator besteht aus zwei Spulen, die sich nicht berhren und Induktion (Umwandlung von einem elektrischen Feld in ein magnetisches und dann wieder in ein elektrisches Feld) findet nur statt, wenn sich das elektrische bzw. das magnetische Feld ?ndert.  Bei Gleichspannung ?ndert sich das elektrisch Feld aber nicht.  Bei Wechselspannung hingegen schon: Hier ?ndert sich ja nicht nur das Vorzeichen, sondern sogar die Spannung, sodass die eine Spule, an der die Wechselspannung anliegt, ein sich ?nderndes Magnetfeld hat und dieses sich ?ndernde Magnetfeld ruft in der anderen Spule (an der sich dein L?mpchen befindet) eine zeitlich leicht verschobene Wechselspannung hervor.|`|dc3ec4ac7118b2001cc3ef72b92a7b7aaa	Weil es eine Leuchtdiode ist, die extra so eingebaut wurde?

aY3MEV9saa	As you coast down the hill, the potential energy (m*g*h) you had is converted to kinetic energy (1/2*m*v^2).  The velocity is determined by sqrt (2*g*h) = sqrt (2*9.81*15) = 17.2 m/s * 1km/1000m * 3600s/hr = 61.9 km/hr.    Now, if you were at rest at time 0, your velocity would be 61.9 km/hr.  But, since your initial velocity was 35 km/hr, you're getting clocked at roughly 97 km/hr.  In reality, it would probably be less due to the frictional forces slowing you down (wind drag and tire friction), but you are going to be faster than 70km/hr.|`|7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	No. There is no way that you'll double your velocity.

7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	It's doesn't.  It just seems to heat up faster as time passes because the water molecules are becoming more energetic with the constant addition of heat, until they hit the boiling point and start to change phase from liquid to gas vapor.|`|Kf1TDHZAaa	Water does not "heat up faster over a longer period of time."    If water heats up quickly (fast), it does not happen over a long period of time.  A long period of time is a definition of "slow".   Fast can be defined as quickly or over a short period of time.    Regardless, it should be noted that relative to, say, vegetation or the air, water heats and cools very slowly.  In the beginning of summer, it is common for rivers, lakes, and especially the ocean, to be very cold even when it is very warm outside.  This is because water's temperature is very slow to change due to its Specific Heat Capacity    Other interesting, related topics are:  * The Mpemba effect, which is in regard to the phenomenon where by hot water freezes faster than cold water.  * Hot ice, where by applying electricity to ice, it may maintain a solid icy state even at room temperature. (perhaps this is somehow related to the Mpemba effect?)

87aR0FpRaa	Solution \So*lu"tion\ (s[-o]*l[=u]"sh[u^]n), n. [OE. solucion, OF. solucion, F. solution, fr. L. solutio, fr. solvere, solutum, to loosen, dissolve. See Solve.] 1. The act of separating the parts of any body, or the condition of undergoing a separation of parts; disruption; breach.    In all bodies there is an appetite of union and evitation of solution of continuity. --Bacon.    2. The act of solving, or the state of being solved; the disentanglement of any intricate problem or difficult question; explanation; clearing up; -- used especially in mathematics, either of the process of solving an equation or problem, or the result of the process.    3. The state of being dissolved or disintegrated; resolution; disintegration.    It is unquestionably an enterprise of more promise to assail the nations in their hour of faintness and solution, than at a time when magnificent and seductive systems of worship were at their height of energy and splendor. --I. Taylor.    4. (Chem.Phys.) The act or process by which a body (whether solid, liquid, or gaseous) is absorbed into a liquid, and, remaining or becoming fluid, is diffused throughout the solvent; also, the product reulting from such absorption.    Note: When a solvent will not take in any more of a substance the solution is said to be saturated. Solution is two kinds; viz.: (a) Mechanical solution, in which no marked chemical change takes place, and in which, in the case of solids, the dissolved body can be regained by evaporation, as in the solution of salt or sugar in water. (b) Chemical solution, in which there is involved a decided chemical change, as when limestone or zinc undergoes solution in hydrochloric acid. Mechanical solution is regarded as a form of molecular or atomic attraction, and is probably occasioned by the formation of certain very weak and unstable compounds which are easily dissociated and pass into new and similar compounds.    Note: This word is not used in chemistry or mineralogy for fusion, or the melting of bodies by the heat of fire.    5. release; deliverance; discharge. [Obs.] --Barrow.    6. (Med.) (a) The termination of a disease; resolution. (b) A crisis. (c) A liquid medicine or preparation (usually aqueous) in which the solid ingredients are wholly soluble. --U. S. Disp.    Fehling's solution (Chem.), a standardized solution of cupric hydrate in sodium potassium tartrate, used as a means of determining the reducing power of certain sugars and sirups by the amount of red cuprous oxide thrown down.     Heavy solution (Min.), a liquid of high density, as a solution of mercuric iodide in potassium iodide (called the Sonstadt or Thoulet solution) having a maximum specific gravity of 3.2, or of borotungstate of cadium (Klein solution, specific gravity 3.6), and the like. Such solutions are much used in determining the specific gravities of minerals, and in separating them when mechanically mixed as in a pulverized rock.    Nessler's solution. See Nesslerize.    Solution of continuity, the separation of connection, or of connected substances or parts; -- applied, in surgery, to a fracture, laceration, or the like. ``As in the natural body a wound, or solution of continuity, is worse than a corrupt humor, so in the spiritual.'' --Bacon.    Standardized solution (Chem.), a solution which is used as a reagent, and is of a known and standard strength; specifically, a normal solution, containing in each cubic centimeter as many milligrams of the element in question as the number representing its atomic weight; thus, a normal solution of silver nitrate would contain 107.7 mgr. of silver nitrate in each cubic centimeter.|`|63c45926aa49315c26b05ba633120fb3aa	What the 1st guy above says is correct.    To go further Standard Solution - means a large volume of solution that you are going to use over and over again - that is why you need to know the concentration exactly.    Typically you prepare a rough estimately for a solution you are shooting for (say 0.1M NaOH).  Then you  carefully measure out an amount of reagent (say KHP see ref)    http://www.cerlabs.com/experiments/10875...    You then titrate several samples and average the results.  The average is the value you will assign to you stand solution.|`|df26ecc4e1fbb11df65241e9c0c7c3e0aa	When you standardize a solution, you determine its analytical concentration by comparing it (chemically) with another solution or chemical whose concentration (or mass) is VERY KNOWN.  This extremely well known and reproducible solution is called a "primary standard".  It is made from a chemical that you can accurately measure / weigh out, etc. and get the same value every time.    Usually, you perform a titration or some other chemical test that determines how much of your primary standard that the solution in question will react with.  That amount, when related to the concentration of the primary standard, then allows for the determination of the concentration of the solution you are trying to standardize.      For acids and bases, titrations against standard bases and acids (respectively) are usually used.  But there are other methods of standardization, depending on the analyte being standardized.
AA11609393	Spelling help?|`|451075cc0b28ffa413b31fd0b3fd84c0aa	THE main thing about chemistry (besides it being really hard) is the wonderful fact that all stuff - everything is made up of little bits we call atoms.  And of all the many many many different things in the world theres just a couple of dozen important kinds of atoms.  In olden days, they thought that maybe there were just four (five )elements: Earth, Air, Water, Fire, (and Spirit).  But no bits.  THey thought these were fluids you could mix in different amounts to get whatever.  Thats why there were people trying to make gold out of lead, etc.  So the discovery that there are about a hundred different elements and each and every one of them is made up of just three things: electrons, neutrons and protons is pretty cool.  Some of the results of these facts is that any pure substance has a definite formula.  (well ... this is "almost" true)  SO the first thing you have to do to balance any equation is to make sure that there are the same number of atoms of each element on either side of the reaction. C2 +O2  -> CO4 is soooo wrong.  Atoms cant disappear in chemistry nor can they "magically" appear.  THe second thing you have to do is make sure the charge on both sides of the reaction is also equal.    C(+2) + 2Ar -> C + 2Ar(+)   is correct cuz there are two plusses on each side.  electrons orbit the nucleus of every atom.  the "nucleus" is made up of protons and almost always neutrons (hydrogen is just one electron and one proton and no neutrons in every atom).  So you can picture an atom as a bunch of electrons in orbit around the nucleus - like satellites around the Earth and you can picture the nucleus as being a ball of neutrons and protons smushed together like jelly beans (or raisins) which somebody sat on on a warm day - all stuck together.  Electrons can't be split any smaller and they each have exactly the same charge, a negative charge of -1.  Protons can be split apart, but not chemically - only in nuclear atom smashers and super high energy physics like in a H bomb or in the sun or a black hole.  That isn't chemistry, its physics!  We chemists ignore that stuff.  Protons each have a plus charge (positive +1).  Neutrons are neutral with zero charge but a physicist can smash them up into a proton, a electron and some other physics stuff.  Chemists ignore that stuff, too.  So, ya gotta count each element separately:    C5H12 + 3O2    has how many atoms? (23 - count 'em!)  so  C5H12 + 3O2 -> 2(C2H4O2) + CH2(OH)2  count each kind of atom on both sides they must be equal.  If they are equal the equation is balanced.  The tricky thing is to adjust the number to the left of each formula to make the atoms balance.      C + 2O2 ->CO2   doesn't balance  (check it!)  so we tinker and come up with  C + O2 -> CO2  check it out.  note the only numbers we can change without changing the stuff (the formula) is the number to the left of each formula, NOT the numbers inside the formula eg  2C means two Carbon atoms but C2 means a molecule of dicarbon which is not the same thing as 2C, at all.|`|OWmFD6OLaa	you have to many questions to answer online. i suggest etiher getting a tutor, getting a smart friend to help or seeing the teacher after school. ask your guidance consular about tutors.

TRLRsNwWaa	Latent heat is the heat required to change a substance from one state to another.    Say 1Kg of ice is slowly warmed to the point where it is JUST starting to melt. The latent heat of liquification per Kg, is the energy it takes to convert it from just starting to melt, to the last bit turning to water.    Heat it until it is JUST beginning to boil and the Latent heat of evaporation is the heat needed to just boil it all away.    The reverse is also true, you get the same heat back as you condense the steam back into water (latent heat of condensation) and then when it becomes ice (latent heat of solidification).

The floor function gives you the greatest integer less than or equal to the number.  So the ceiling of 5.26 is 6, and the floor of 7.25 is 7.    One way to remember the floor function is that it essentially means "drop the decimal part".  The ceiling function drops the decimal but adds 1 if the number wasn't an integer in the first place.    These functions are particularly helpful in computer programming.  For example, sometimes you're doing divisions and don't care about the remainder.  Most programming languages call the floor function "INT" for "integer".

There is a formula that contains initial velocity, final velocity, time and accelleration:     v = u + at  v = final velocity  u = initial velocity  a = accelleration  t = time in seconds    Plugging in the values for these given in the question, you get:       v = u + at  1.75 = 0 + (a x 5)   We don't know a, so try to get it on one side  1.75 - 0 = 5a       1.75 = 5a  1.75 / 5 = 5a / 5  So:  a = 0.35 m/s^2    Now:  Force = Mass x Acceleration            = 550 x 0.35            = 192.5 N    And:  Power = Force x Velocity    At the start, the velocity is zero, so you have:  Power = Force x Velocity             = 192.5 x 0             = 0 W    At the end, the velocity is 1.75 m/s, so you have:  Power = Force x Velocity             = 192.5 x 1.75             = 336.875 W    So the (mean) average is (0 + 336.875) / 2 = 168.4375 W    When the elevator is moving at its cruising speed though, it is not accellerating at all as it is neither speeding up or down. So:  Force = Mass x Acceleration            = 550 x 0            = 0 N    And:  Power = Force x Velocity             = 0 x 1.75             = 0 W  So Pcruising = 0W    I hope this helps a little?!|`|CQjMs1keaa	Hell!

They weigh the same, of course. Now, which occupies more space, a pound of lead or one of feathers? Surely the feathers. If I gave you a definition of density being equal to mass divided by volume which would you say is more dense; lead or feathers?    Not surprisingly, "pure" water is the standard for density. For this phenomenon, at a certain standard temperature and pressure, the density of water is 1.000 (grams per cubic centimeter). Now here comes a key question. What happens when you dissolve something in water in terms of it's density? Well, it depends on the density of that material. Let's say it's a gas that's 'lighter' (i.e. less dense) than water. Then, the density decreases. But most stuff we put in our tanks, salt mix, food- dissolved wastes, water additives, medications are more dense than the water; therefore raising the overall density of the solution.    The concept of density and what makes it up in our captive seas is germinal to understanding that it is not the same as salinity; though they are bandied about as if they were.    The salinity and composition of seawater of reefs varies little around the world. This is not the case in captive systems; and can be a problem. Salts differentially crystallize on the top of tanks, filter sumps, etc. and are lost. Freshwater leaves solution as evaporation. All manner of soluble solids and liquids build-up and increase the density of the captive seawater.    Many aquarists have bought into the notion that specific gravity and salinity are the same. Their systems can get into trouble quickly if they are of small volumes, poorly covered and maintained.    Happily, by following some simple guidelines, specific gravity can be considered a broad equivalent measure of salinity. Keeping this variable homeostatic along with temperature goes a long way in providing an optimum stress-free environment for your livestock.    Measure:    Salinity is the amount of total salts in a given weight of seawater, generally expressed in parts per thousand (S 0/00). There is, as you could guess, a more formal scientific definition in terms of converted solids in a kilogram of seawater. We don't need to get that involved.    Salinity may be measured by standard methods of boiling a sample down in a laboratory. Chemist-Aquarists "with inquiring minds" can employ titration methods, available in test-kit form, that indirectly through measuring chlorinity (55 percent of salt solids in seawater).    There are refractometric means. Salts bend light that can be gauged in a microscopic-looking tool.    There are other electronic ways, but by and large aquarists don't use any of these; and for good reasons: They cost more money, and simpler specific gravity indicators give good enough service.    Specific gravity (spg) of "fresh" natural or synthetic water can be used to approximate a weight relationship between salts and salinity. The tools that yield values of relative density of seawater are called hydrometers; they come in two basic formats, floating glass and plastic box types.    Glass hydrometers, frequently outfitted with an inner thermometer, range widely in their accuracy. Small, inexpensive models are notoriously bad, while larger (12" plus) ones can be pricey. Let me save you some money and frustration, please. Whatever you pay, get and stay in the habit of using your glass hydrometer in a separate, narrow container; not your system. I could have retired years ago on the money lost in broken glass hydrometers left in tanks and filter sumps. Reading your hydrometer properly is also easier in a static test chamber.    These tube-shaped implements float more or less depending on the density of solution their in. Hydrometers bear calibrated scales on their upper necks. You 'read' the density relative to fresh water (aka specific gravity) as the apparent line across the water's flat surface.    Plastic box type hydrometers are comprised of a small container with an articulating pivot that floats to point at a embossed scale. Get in the habit of rapping the filled box to knock off air bubbles on the pivot, and rinsing the box with freshwater after use to attain/maintain accuracy.    Setting/Manipulating Spg:    First and foremost know this, there is no one specific gravity/salinity that is perfect for marine systems. I mention this not only so you won't agonize over constant checking and adjustment, but because it's a fact. Though below-surface values are remarkably constant in the wild, in our systems stability is far more important, within a range.    As a general rule, marine systems are best maintained between a specific gravity of 1.020 and 1.025, avoiding changes of more than a thousandth a day.    Fish only systems are frequently kept at artificially low specific gravities (1.017-1.020) commercially for three principal benefits. 1) Cost of salt mix is less; even "natural" water that has to be hauled may be diluted with fresh at a savings. 2) Parasite and microbial levels are reduced; they can't make the osmotic stretch as well as macro-life. 3) Gas solubility is enhanced; increasing capacity, health. The margin of safety in rapid-adjusting fishes to new spg is dependent on several factors, especially their adaptive state. Take care to use a hydrometer to measure the water new charges come in and adjust them over a number of days to system spg (another reason for a quarantine/hospital tank).    Fishes (et alia res.) that originate from the Red Sea, parts of the Indian Ocean where natural specific gravity is high (@ 1.027), Achilles tangs, seahorses, and several types that live in close conjunction with invertebrates (e.g. clown anemone fishes) are exceptions that bear mentioning. These require consistent, higher range densities (1.023-1.025) 
TRLRsNwWaa	Bubble wrap is a good thermal insulator, because air is.    The air trapped in the bubbles are actully why it insulates so well.    If you put it so the bubbles are inwards and the "flat" side is outwards, this helps trap more air around the object and makes it a little more effective still.    Aluminium foil on the outside of a thermos made for a project will help reflect any radiated heat back.    Heat is trasferred by three methods:  1. Conduction  2. Convection  3. Radiation    Conduction is where you heat one end of a metal rod and the other end gets hot as well. This is because the metal is conducting the heat away from the hot end.    Convection is where heat travels (typically through the air in a room). The heated air is less dense and so rises. The colder air then flows in at the bottom, until it gets heated and rises in turn.    Convection takes place in water. You can actually see "waves" sometimes in water if you look into an electric kettle soon after it is turned on.    Radiation is where heat is trasmitted by elecro-magnetic radiation (infra-red). Stand by an fire and you can feel the heat from it. Put a sheet of card infront of you and you can no longer feel the heat. This is because the card is stopping the infra-red light from reaching you.    I hope this helps?!

TRLRsNwWaa	Hi!    It is the amount of current that flows through you that kills you.    With dry skin and insulated electrical appliances, there is no electrical connection between you and live parts of the appliance.    Water will not only make a connection to the live parts of the appliance and yourself, it also reduces the skins' resistance to current flow to a level low enough that sufficient will flow through you as to be incompatible with life.    I hope this helps?!|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	Electrical current flows through water (Actually, it is the salt, and other ionic solids, dissolved in the water that carries the current, so sweaty people will carry  slightly more current than someone who is just out of the shower).

cb3656a2c298507e8fae57c35ca71af7aa	[1/3x1/4]+[1/6/8/3]    I'm going to add parentheses to clarify what I think you mean.    [(1/3)(1/4)] + [(1/6)/(8/3)]    The first half of the problem:  [(1/3)(1/4)]    When you multiply fractions, you multiply the two numerators (the numbers on the top of the fractions) and you multiply the two denominators (the numbers on the bottom of the fractions).    So,     1/3 times 1/4 =  1x1 / 3x4 =   1/12    And the second half of the problem:  [(1/6)/(8/3)]    Now, when you DIVIDE BY a fraction, you can flip the fraction you are DIVINDING BY (in this case, the fraction you are dividing by is 8/3) and multiply it to the first fraction.    So,   (1/6) divided by (8/3) is the same thing as   (1/6) times (3/8)    See what I mean?  And what is (1/6) x (3/8)? it's going to be:     (1 times 3) divided by (6 times 8).  whcih equals:  3/48    Alright, so now you need to add (1/12) + (3/48). To do this, we need to find a common denominator. In other words, a common denominator is a number that is a multiple of all the denominators of a set of fractions. We're trying to get all the denominators to be the same number before we add.     The lowest common denominator of 12 and 48 is 48, since 12 times 4 = 48. So we can leave the 3/48 alone, but we need to change the 1/12.    When we change fractions, all we can do is multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same number. So our new fraction will reduce to the same fraction as before, the same way 6/3 = 2/1. If you multiply 2 by 3 and multiply 1 by 3, you get 6 and 3.    So, since 12 times 4 = 48, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 1/12 by 4.    So, 1/12 = (1 x 4) / (12 x 4) = 4/48    Does 4/48 still equal 1/12? Yes.    Now we can finally add the two numbers.    4/48 + 3/48 =     7/48    And 7/48 is your final answer.|`|w2xsd28Qaa	first, work on the left side.  we can just multiply fractions straight across the top and bottom 1x1=1, and 3x4=12, so 1/3 x 1/4 = 1/12.  just picture it pizza split into 4 parts, then splitting those pieces into 3 more each.    the right side.  that is 1/6 divided by 8/3, right?  first re-write it as i just did.  then, invert the bottom and multiply it.  so it is now 1/6 x 3/8.  just like dividing something by 2, and multiplying by 1/2 are the same thing, dividing by 8/3 is the same as multiplying 3/8.  so multiply straight across again so we get 3/48, which reduces to 1/16.    then add 1/12 + 1/16 by finding a common denominator, which in this case is 48.  4/48 + 3/48 = 7/48|`|AA12230949	=(1/12)+(3/48)  =(4/48)+(3/48)  =(4+3)/48  =7/48|`|O5mkNRRJaa	[1/3*1/4]+[1/6/8/3]    =[(1/3)*(1/4))]+[1/{6/(8/3)}]    =[1/(3*4)]+[1/{6*3/8}]    =[1/12]+[1/(9/4)]    =1/12+4/9    =(9+4*12)/(12*9)    =57/108|`|AA11095128	1/3 x 1/4 = 1/12   1/6 / 8/3 = 1/6 x 3/8 = 3/48  1/12 + 3/48 = 4/48 + 3/48 = 7/48|`|Ipstf2Lyaa	{ 1/3 x 1/4} + { 1/6/8/3 }  = {1/12} + { 1/144 }    6x8x3 = 144  =1/12 + 1 /144  = 12 /144 + 1 /144  = 13/144|`|b92346119b733164d778e9eaf135901daa	1)Solve what's in the parenthesis          [1/3x1/4]=1/12          [1/6 / 8/3]=[1/6x3/8]=3/48=1/16  2)Make greatest common denominator          12 and 16 go into 48, so           [1/12] has to be multiplied by 4= 4/48                            and           [1/16] has to be multipled by 3= 3/48  3)Add fractions      4/48 + 3/48= 7/48=final answer

OXsRXLx1aa	Speak with a local engineering college about their Co-Op program. In today's "Tough Economy" an internship is actually one of the best things out there. It's much cheaper than hiring a full-time electrical engineer and they get just about the same use out of you! Hourly students with no benefits are much cheaper than a full time salary-worker with benefits.    A Co-Op is just a fancy word for intern. It usually implies that you are being hired for the entirety of your college duration and that you'll work several semesters for them. At my college (University of Akron, Ohio) the Co-op program is three semesters (first summer semester is optional) and alternates fulltime work with fulltime school.

Ngoa2mY4aa	i will answer in order.     becoming a physician is not an easy task.  you will likely be away from family and friends for more than a decade of your life.  big sacrifices as well.  but...if you really want it bad enough, it is the most satisfying and secure career you could ever dream of.  pay ranges and can be poor or exceptional...ranging from $120k/year to millions/year (on average) depending on success, where you practice, specialty, etc.    i decided i wanted to become a doctor at the age of 4 or 4.5, literally...  i stuck with it, needless to say, 25 years later i'm an M.D.  many of my colleagues have similar stories.    now onto the specifics...physicians come in all different flavors.  you can't choose which you want to be until you experience it.  or at least i wouldnt if i were you.  i already did enough pre-planning at 4 years old, and even i changed my mind multiple times once in medical school.    the type of doctor you become also depends on your licensing (boards) scores (there are 2 that are really important and a third that is also very important).  you're specialties listed above vary in respect to scores.  also demand changes and by the time you are old enough to practice you may want to go into geriatrics (dealing with older smelly people) or preventative meds like a family physician... because of the large amount of old smelly people when your 30 years old.  also, alot of doctors dont want to deal with old people, i personally think they are gross (i am kidding, sort of).  just an FYI to think about.    exam scores really matter for oncologists and somewhat for EM docs.      think about it this way...first you have to ace high school to get into a decent college and have a good background of knowledge for college.   then you need to ace your way through college with a 3.8+ GPA and 3.8+ GPA in youre pre-med classes.  then you need to ace your MCAT exam while in the middle of college or during your summer vacation.  then you need to apply all over again and go through interviews and get accepted into med school.  now you have 4 years of medical school which can be described as follows; think of what it took to get STRAIT A's in college?  now imagine having to work considerably harder to get barely PASSING grades in medical school.  if you want good grades in basic sciences it takes much harder work.  also exams throughout your medical school and career aren't exactly easy...we are talking about many times harder than the MCAT, which most people consider the "hardest exam in the world", etc etc.  they are forgetting that the small percentage of people that do stellar on the MCAT go on and still -fail- the USMLE (docs licensing exam)..maybe not alot but a small percentage of people who do very well on the MCAT can still fail the USMLE which shows just how hard the exam is.  i personally knew everything under the son and still only recieved the "average" score on those exams and i studied for 2 months day and night with nothing else to do.    after medical school you have residency which lasts around 4-7 years usually depending on your decided career path.  this is similar to your clinical years of med school but more hours, more stressful, you're paid little instead of no money, and you have more "things" in you're "scope of care".  finally, you can do post-graduate training to specialize even more.  this can be 2+ years.  many doctors do this as well.    total-   college: 4-5 years with pre-med classes  +4 years med school  +4, 5, 6, or 7 years residency  +post-grad 2+ years    absolute minimum= 12 years (8 yrs. specifically in med school/residency) if no bumps in the road.  absolute maximum= 20 yrs is possible with no bumps in the road. (5 yrs of undergrad- college included + 15 years of med school, residency, post-grad, specialized training)    my collegeagues and myself= 17 years including bachelors in biology.  surgery (currently in the middle of this whole process)    and forget about getting to post things on here and reply like i am.  i am on vacation, and spend my time reading books i used to hate and posting things on here to help you succeed...no more partying, hanging out with friends, stress free vacations, etc except one day a week drinks at the bar at most.    good luck and contact some docs and ask to "shadow" them...you will have alot of fun.|`|PleCBQeqaa	CollEge ;)    Those are all very good career choices, but all four require similar amounts of schooling, which is a LOT.    To become a doctor, you must go through  4 years undergraduate (college)  4 years of medical school  3-5 years of residency (depending on your specialty)  1-3 years of internship (depending on specialty).    Anesthesiologists are the highest paid people in the country, with Emergency Room Physcians being next in line, then Oncologists, then Psychiatrists (not over all, just pertaining to your list).    You will be on call (meaning they can call you into work) pretty much 24/7 being an Anesthesiologist or ER doctor. Oncologists probably not as much, and I don't think at all for Psychiatrists.     Anesthesiologists and ER doctors can have a hectic lifestyle, but they get paid good and get good vacation time. However, their skills and concentration are critical because one flaw could mean life or death for a person,    As an Oncologist, you are a specialist that needs to know everything about cancer. They preforms some procedures, but do a lot of diagnostics and things.    Being a Psychiatrist, you need to be willing to deal with delicate, emotionally and mentally distrubed people. You need patience, and although out of your four choices this is probably the "easiest" this is of the lesser medical salaries.    As for colleges, High School only matters when it comes to getting into a good college. Go to college, do well, and get into a good medical school, it is there that counts.    You don't want to rack up a huge debt during undergrad, so go to the college that gives you the most money in scholarships or aid, not the 50,000 a year school that "looks pretty," trust me in the long run it's better. Bottom line, do well throughout school, and work hard not only in the classroom but also the community.     If you have any other questions just email me, I'd be happy to help    -Vic

Gnfc4wRlaa	Earthquakes happen when the Earth's crust slips along cracks, known as faults. Major faults can be found at the junction of independently moving masses of crust and mantle, known as tectonic plates.    Each earthquake releases seismic waves-vibrations at the cusp, or below the range of human hearing - that travel through the Earth. These waves can trigger aftershocks in a zone several to tens of miles away from the radiating main earthquake, known as a "mainshock." Most aftershocks usually occur within hours to days after the mainshock.    Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes which occur in the same general area during the days to years following a larger event or "mainshock", defined as within 1-2 fault lengths away and during the period of time before the background seismicity level has resumed. As a general rule, aftershocks represent minor readjustments along the portion of a fault that slipped at the time of the main shock. The frequency of these aftershocks decreases with time. Historically, deep earthquakes (>30km) are much less likely to be followed by aftershocks than shallow earthquakes. (Univ. of Washington)|`|9SgoJ4aDaa	no time
AWPaPV4Eaa	Humans don't effect tides - the moon does.  Human constructions near shorelines can affect how far the waterline will move between high tide and low tide, and rising sea levels caused by global warming will obviously move tidal zones further inland.|`|256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa	I would say we don't.  The force of a tide is huge.  You're talking about trillions of pounds of water moving several feet (depending on the location) which is a very large amount of energy - our ability to affect that is very limited.  There was going to be a tidal electric generation project in the Bay of Fundy - let the tide flow in, close the dam, flow it out through a big turbine and make electricity.  I don't know if they ever built it.  And there are a few projects here and there that put turbines in high tidal flows.  But the systems extract a small percentage of the local tidal power and an infinitesimally small percentage of the global tidal power.    Did you ever look at a wind farm - a bunch of electricity generating windmills on a hill in a windy mountain pass.  How much slower do you think the wind is blowing on the lee side of that wind farm?  The only way to extract power from a moving mass is to slow it down and it's hard to imagine that our most efficient wind farms extract more than a bit of the power of the wind.  Now, water is far more massive than air and so the challenge is even greater.

AA10927246	The formula for compounding interest is:  A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)    P is the initial principle (1800)  r is the rate as a decimal (0.07)  n is the number of times it compounds in a year (365, I guess)  t is the number of years (4)    A = 1800(1 + 0.07/365)^(365 * 4)  A = 2,381.56973    Rounding:  A = 2,381.57    But this is the total amount.

i0ypGmlQaa	The numbers must be "relatively prime."    That means they have no prime factors in common. This also works for two (non-equal) primes as well, since two different primes have no factors in common!    The condition "relatively prime" is equivalent to saying:    gcd(a,b) = 1    Which then allows us to simply use the formula:    lcm(a,b) = ab / gcd(a,b) = ab / 1 = ab    to prove your result.    ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------     Examples:    The numbers 27 and 14 are relatively prime. Why?    27 = 3  3  3  14 = 2  7    Thus their LCM is just:    3  3  3  2  7 = 27  14 = 378    and of course their GCD is 1.    BUT what if it's not the case? The numbers 8 and 14 are:    8 = 2  2  2  14 = 2  7    The product is 8  14 = 112    But that is NOT their LCM because we have a redundant 2. It is actually 56 that is the LCM.    lcm(8,14) = 8  14 / gcd(8,14) = 112 / 2 = 56    ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------     Proof: lcm(a,b)gcd(a,b) = ab    For any prime number p, it goes into a some number of times. Say p divides a evenly n times. Say p divides b evenly m times. In other words:    a is divisible by p^n  b is divisible by p^m    p appears in lcm(a,b) to a power of MAX(n,m).  p appears in gcd(a,b) to a power of MIN(n,m).    For example, in lcm(8,14) if the prime p=2, then n=3 and m=1, so that 2 appears once in the gcd, but 3 times in the lcm.    Thus the product of the lcm and gcd is divisible by p^(MAX(n,m)) times p^(MIN(n,m)). But that's either going to be p^m p^n or p^n p^m.    But the order doesn't matter, and we conclude that p^(n+m) is exactly the power of p dividing lcm(a,b)gcd(a,b). But that is also the power of p dividing ab.    Repeat this for every prime, and proof is complete:    lcm(a,b)gcd(a,b) = ab|`|AA10927246	When they have no prime number factors in common (i.e. are what's known as "relatively prime" to each other).

When a conductor moves in a magnetic field (or when a magnetic field moves in the presence of a conductor), current is produced.  By the same token, an electrical current induces a magnetic field.  So a moving magnet produces current in the aluminum, which in turn produces a magnetic field, resulting in the drag effect seen on the magnet.|`|TRLRsNwWaa	The rolling magnet is inducing a current in the aluminium foil.

A pH of 7 is neutral - Like water, it is neither acid or alkali.    So you might think a pH balanced shampoo would have a pH of 7 then, but not necessarily. Some beauty products say this can do damage, since the pH of skin, hair etc. is not 7.

They carry oxygen to the various tissues and organs of the body.|`|lFDfE98Waa	erythrocytes are the constituents of blood.it is also known as r.b.c.means red blood corpuscles.they help in transportation of oxygen to different parts of our body by means of hemoglobin present in it.|`|mDpHqCLwaa	Erythrocytes are Red Blood Cells(one of thye cellular components present in blood)    Structure:  erythrocytes are biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumb-bell shaped cross section. In large blood vessels, red blood cells sometimes occur as a stack, flat side next to flat side. This is known as rouleaux formation, and it occurs more often if the levels of certain serum proteins are elevated, as for instance during inflammation.  function:  Erythrocytes consist mainly of haemoglobin, a complex molecule containing heme groups whose iron atoms temporarily link to oxygen molecules in the lungs or gills and release them throughout the body. Oxygen can easily diffuse through the red blood cell's cell membrane. Haemoglobin also carries some of the waste product carbon dioxide back from the tissues. (In humans, less than 2% of the total oxygen, and most of the carbon dioxide, is held in solution in the blood plasma). A related compound, myoglobin, acts to store oxygen in muscle cells.  other imp information:  Erythrocytes in mammals are anucleate when mature, meaning that they lack a cell nucleus and thus have no DNA. In comparison, the erythrocytes of nearly all other vertebrates have nuclei; the only known exception is salamanders of the Batrachoseps genus. Mammalian erythrocytes also lose their other organelles including their mitochondria and produce energy by fermentation, via glycolysis of glucose followed by lactic acid production. Furthermore, red cells do not have an insulin receptor and thus glucose uptake is not regulated by insulin. As a result of the lack of nucleus and organelles, the cells cannot produce new structural or repair proteins or enzymes and their lifespan is limited.|`|b95bd589d1a9fc99ea64dfcfe48add84aa	Erythrocytes=Red blood cells     SHAPE  Erythrocytes is a biconcave disk-shaped structure.   Front view: Round  Side view : Biconcave    STRUCTURE  Erythrocytes do not contain a nucleus. They do contain haemoglobin, which fills almost the entire cytoplasm.     FUNCTION  Erythrocytes function in the transport of oxygen. Haemoglobin, the oxygen binding protein in erythrocytes, contributes about 30% of the weight of an erythrocyte. The lifespan of an erythrocyte in the bloodstream is 100-120 days.  About 51011 erythrocytes are formed/destroyed each day.

Bile (or gall) is a bitter, yellow or green alkaline fluid secreted by hepatocytes from the liver of most vertebrates. In many species, it is stored in the gallbladder between meals and upon eating is discharged into the duodenum where it excretes waste and aids the process of digestion of lipids.    The cholesterol contained in bile will occasionally accrete into lumps in the gall bladder, forming bile stones.     STONES  In medicine, bile stones (choleliths) are crystalline bodies formed within the body by accretion or concretion of normal or abnormal bile components.  Cholesterol stones are usually green, but are sometimes white or yellow in color and account for about 80 percent of bile stones. They are made primarily of cholesterol.  Pigment stones are small, dark stones made of bilirubin and calcium salts that are found in bile. They account for the other 20 percent of bile stones. Risk factors for pigment stones include cirrhosis, biliary tract infections, and hereditary blood cell disorders, such as sickle cell anemia. Stones of mixed origin also occur.    Bile stones' size varies and may be as small as a sand grain or as large as a golf ball. The gallbladder may develop a single, often large, stone or many smaller ones, even several thousand.

They are the largest group of fresh water lakes on Earth. The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system is the largest fresh-water system in the world. They are sometimes referred to as inland seas.    The Great Lakes are:    Lake Superior (the largest by volume and deepest, larger than Scotland or South Carolina)   Lake Michigan (the second-largest by volume and third-largest by area; the only one entirely in the U.S.)   Lake Huron (the third-largest by volume; the second largest in area)   Lake Erie (the smallest by volume and most shallow of all the great lakes)   Lake Ontario (the second-smallest in volume and smallest in area, much lower elevation than the rest)     Lakes Michigan and Huron, being hydrologically intertwined, are sometimes considered to be one entity: Lake Michigan-Huron. Considered together, Michigan-Huron would be larger in surface area than Lake Superior, but smaller in total water volume.    A much smaller lake, Lake St. Clair, is part of the Great Lakes system between Lake Huron and Lake Erie, but is not considered one of the "Great Lakes." Lake Nipigon is another large lake that is part of the same hydrological system, but not part of the Great Lakes proper. The system also includes the rivers that connect the lakes: St. Marys River between Lake Superior and Lake Huron, the St. Clair River between Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River between Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie, and the Niagara River and Niagara Falls, between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. (Lake Michigan is connected to Lake Huron through the Straits of Mackinac.) Large islands and a peninsula divide Lake Huron into the lake proper and Georgian Bay.    The lakes are bounded by Ontario (all of the lakes but Michigan), Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan (all but Ontario), Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Four of the five lakes straddle the U.S.-Canada border; the fifth, Lake Michigan, is entirely within the United States. The Saint Lawrence River, which marks the same international border for a portion of its course, is a primary outlet of these interconnected lakes, and flows through Quebec and past the Gasp Peninsula to the northern Atlantic Ocean.    Sprinkled throughout the lakes are the approximately 35,000 Great Lakes islands, including Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron, the largest island in any inland body of water, and Isle Royale in Lake Superior, the largest island in the largest lake (each island large enough to itself contain multiple lakes).    Today, 20 percent of the worlds fresh surface water is contained in the five great lakes: 5,473 cubic miles (22,812 km3), or 22.81 quadrillion litres (6 quadrillion U.S. gallons) in all. It is enough water to cover the contiguous 48 states to a uniform depth of 2.9 m (9.5 feet). The combined surface area of the lakes is 244,100 km2 (94,250 square miles)  larger than the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire combined or the provinces of Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador combined.    The Great Lakes coast measures 17,549 km (10,900 miles) (including islands and connecting channels), nearly as long as the total US ocean coastline (19,928 km, or 12,383 miles), including Alaska.    The Saint Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway opened the Great Lakes to ocean-going vessels. However the move to wider ocean-going container ships - which do not fit through the locks on these routes - has limited shipping on the lakes. Despite their vast size, large sections of the Great Lakes freeze over in winter, and most shipping stops during that season. There are some icebreakers that operate on the lakes.    The lakes have an effect on weather in the region, known as lake effect. In winter, the moisture picked up by the prevailing winds from the west can produce very heavy snowfall, especially along lakeshores to the east such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ontario, and New York. It is not uncommon for heavy snow to occur during completely clear skies because of this phenomenon. The lakes also moderate seasonal temperatures somewhat, by absorbing heat and cooling the air in summer, then slowly radiating that heat in autumn. This temperature buffering produces areas known as "fruit belts", where fruit typically grown farther south can be produced in commercial quantities, the eastern shore of Lake Michigan is home to many wineries as a result of this.    The Great Lakes were formed at the end of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago, when the Laurentide ice sheet receded. When this happened, the glaciers left behind a large amount of meltwater (see Lake Agassiz) which filled up the basins that the glaciers had carved, thus creating the Great Lakes as we know them today. Because of the uneven nature of glacier erosion, some higher hills became Great Lakes islands. The Niagara Escarpment follows the contour of the Great Lakes between New York and Wisconsin  Herbert Simon called this escarpment the spinal cord of my native land.    The lakes are extensively used for transport, though cargo traffic has decreased considerably in recent years. The Great Lakes Waterway makes each of the lakes accessible.    During settlement, the Great Lakes and its rivers were the only practical means of moving people and freight. Anything and everything floated on the lakes. Some ended up on the bottom because of storms, fires, collisions and underwater hazards. (See Edmund Fitzgerald and Le Griffon.) Barges from middle North America were able to reach the Atlantic Ocean from the Great Lakes when the Erie Canal opened in 1825. By 1848, with the opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal at Chic
51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Infinity is a concept - very handy in mathematics, but probably doesn't exist in reality.  Therefore, I guess you can assign any meaning to it that you are comfortable with when you ask things like "if all infinity collapsed & were destroyed."  Empty space is probably an excellent example of nothing - and even a infinate of nothing is still, you guessed it, nothing.  Interresting questions, though - if we compressed all there is down to the tiniest dot of nothing - where would our reference be? In other words, where would we be to observe it to see what it looked like?  Our brains aren't up to conceptionalizing these things. Perhaps some day.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Euclidean geometry is a model of space that makes liberal use of the concept of infinity. Although it seems to be a poor model, it has proven itself to be extremely useful. In Euclidean geometry, space is either infinitely large or infinitely small in all dimensions. A point is an example of space that is infinitely small in all dimensions. "Nothing at all" is a reasonable English phrasing of the space occupied by a Euclidean point.|`|w2xsd28Qaa	things dont usually have opposites, they have inverses.  so instead of the opposite of infinity, the inverse of it would be infintesimally small.  and if it were possible to compress all of the mass in the universe to a spot that small, you wouldnt be able to see it because it would be a black hole and there would be no light.|`|1tCTrE6Haa	first of all u can't collapse infinity. it is a concept.

The moment before it, there was nothing.. everything came from one point.. I follow the expanding / contracting universe theory.. it begins with a big bang, and all matter is "created" from a single point and shoots outwards.. as the universe grows old, black holes are formed.. sucking matter into a tiny tiny point, compacting it. Eventually as more and more black holes form, their gravity drags all matter into them. They are drawn to each other, until everything in the universe is sucked into 1 point once again, which contains all the matter in the universe, and all the gravity. At this point in time, this "mass" has so much gravity that time itself is stopped (the closer you get to a black hole, the more time slows down)    Then (i believe).. it starts all over again.. no idea how haha.. but thats my theory..    So to answer your question, i believe there will always be infinite empty space, but not time.. and you would not be able to look at it, there would be nothing to see.

The tunic is the thick, tough covering that the adult develops for protection.|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	The name, "tunicate" comes from the firm, but flexible body covering, called a tunic.    Most tunicates live with the posterior or lower end of the barrel attached firmly to a fixed object, and have two openings, or siphons, projecting from the other. Tunicates are plankton feeders. They live by drawing seawater through their bodies.

baee058f8bbabd9f447844fdff4a370faa	During the Ordovician, most of the world's land was collected together in the super-continent Gondwana. Gondwana consisted of Southern Europe, Africa, South America, Antarctica, and Australia. Throughout the Ordovician, Gondwana moved towards the South Pole where it finally came to rest at the end of this period. In the Early Ordovician, North America roughly straddled the equator and almost all of that continent lay underwater. However, by the Middle Ordovician North America became land with a karst topography on exposed carbonate rocks that developed. Taconica, a tectonic highland, formed along the margin of eastern North America. Also at this time, Western and Central Europe were separated and located in the Southern Tropics; Europe shifted towards North America from higher to lower latitudes.     During the Middle Ordovician, uplifts took place in most of the areas that had been under shallow shelf seas. These uplifts are seen as the precursor to glaciation. Also during the Middle Ordovician, latitudinal plate motions appear to have taken place, including the northward drift of the Baltoscandian Plate (northern Europe). Increased sea floor spreading and ridge activity accompanied by volcanic activity occurred in the Llanvirnian. Ocean currents changed as a result of lateral continental plate motions causing the opening of the Atlantic ocean. Sea levels underwent regression and transgression globally. Because of sea level transgression, flooding of the Gondwana craton occurred as well as regional drowning which caused carbonate sedimentation to stop.     During the Ashgillian (Late Ordovician), a major glaciation centered in Africa occurred. Because of this global disturbance, oxygenation, ocean erosion, and a severe drop in sea level resulted. In addition, aggressive circulation, then shrinking, of tropical belts also resulted. This glaciation caused a dramatic regression of ocean waters which drained nearly all craton platforms. More specifically, this glaciation contributed to ecological disruption and mass extinctions. Nearly all conodonts disappeared in the North Atlantic Realm while only certain lineages became extinct in the Midcontinental Realm. Asaphoid larvae-bearing trilobites, echinoderms, brachiopods, bryozoans, graptolites, and chitinozoans also became extinct. The Atlantic Ocean closed as Europe moved towards North America. Climatic fluctuations were extreme as glaciation continued and became more extensive. Cold climates with floating marine ice developed as the maximum glaciation was reached.|`|2LHcmYmuaa	a mass extinction|`|ijlJERa4aa	go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician    i hope you understand it!!!!

Cleavage planes are the planes in the molecular structure that are weakest, allowing the mineral to fracture most readily. Halite, or rock salt for example, has cubic cleavage. It breaks into small cubes because its unit cell forms a cube.     Hardness - Hardness usually refers to the Mohr scale or the hardness of a mineral. it ranges from 1 - 10. Talc is a 1, Fluorite is a 4, Quartz a 7, and Diamond is 10, etc.    Streak - Streak is the color a mineral leaves behing when you scrape it against a surface. Most streak plates are ceramic. You would think that scraping off part of a rock or mineral would leave behind the same color as the sample itself, but its not always true, Hematite can be sinver or grey in color but it leaves behing a brick red streak.|`|2LHcmYmuaa	luster is hoe they shine - like glass or metal  colour - simply the colour you observe  breakage - cleavage plane. a plane on the rock where it breaks easily.   hardness - on the moh scale. scratch on glass and if it leaves a mark its over 6   streak - scrape it on a streak plate and the colour of the streak defines the rock. the streak plate powders the minerals|`|baee058f8bbabd9f447844fdff4a370faa	Luster is one of the ways that help us identify a specific mineral. Here is the definition and  links to the web site for more information.  Luster    Luster is the way the surface of a mineral reflects light. Luster should be observed on a cut or freshly broken, untarnished surface. There are two general types of luster -- metallic and non-metallic. The terms used to describe luster are:    Metallic -- example: gold   Vitreous (glassy) -- example: quartz, tourmaline   Adamantine (brilliant) -- example: diamond   Resinous (like resin or sap from a tree) -- example: sphalerite   Greasy or waxy -- example: turquoise   Pearly -- example: talc   Silky -- example: asbestos   Dull or earthy -- example: bauxite    The color component is as follows.  Color in Minerals  Definition  The recognition of colors in minerals goes back to our pre-historic ancestors who used charcoal and iron oxides to color cave paintings which still retain their original intensity.    Idiochromatic minerals are "self colored" due to their composition. The color is a constant and predictable component of the mineral. Examples are blue Azurite, red Cinnabar, and green Malachite.    Allochromatic minerals are "other colored" due to trace impurities in their composition or defects in their structure. In this case, the color is a variable and unpredictable property of the mineral. Examples are the blue in Amazonite (orthoclase), yellow in Heliodor (spodumene) and the rose in rose quartz.    Pseudochromatic minerals are "false colored" due to tricks in light diffraction. In these cases, color is variable but a unique property of the mineral. Examples are the colors produced by precious opal and the shiller reflections of labradorite.    Breakage is going to have to be synonymous with fracture.    Brittle - Conchoidal   Very brittle fracture producing small, conchoidal fragments.     Brittle - Irregular   Very brittle fracture producing irregular fragments     Brittle - Subconchoidal   Brittle fracture with subconchoidal fragments     Brittle - Splintery   Brittle fracture leaving splintery fragments.     Brittle - Sectile   Brittle fracture with slightly sectile shavings possible.     Brittle   Generally displayed by glasses and most non-metallic minerals.     Brittle - Uneven   Very brittle fracture producing uneven fragments.     Conchoidal   Fractures developed in brittle materials characterized by smoothly curving surfaces, (e.g. quartz).     Conchoidal - Irregular   Irregular fracture producing small, conchoidal fragments.     Conchoidal - Uneven   Uneven fracture producing small, conchoidal fragments.     Elastic   Fragments which spring back after bending.     Earthy   Dull, clay-like fractures with no visible crystalline affinities, (e.g. howlite).     Even   Flat surfaces (not cleavage) fractured in an even pattern.     Fibrous   Thin, elongated fractures produced by crystal forms or intersecting cleavages (e.g. asbestos).     Fragile   Crystals with a delicate and easily injured structure.     Flexible   Flexible fragments.     Friable   The crumbly disintegration of earthy materials or highly fractured minerals.     Granular   Fracture surfaces produced by aggregated minerals, (e.g. granite).     Hackly   Jagged, torn surfaces, (e.g. fractured metals).     Irregular   Flat surfaces (not cleavage) fractured in an irregular pattern.     Micaceous   Fracture of flexable micaceous cleavage fragments.     Malleable   Deforms rather than breaking apart with a hammer.     None   No fractures     Plastic   Deforms like soft, plastic materials.     Plastic - Splintery   Thin, soft flexable, elongated fractures produced by intersecting good cleavages or partings (e.g. hornblende).     Regular   Flat surfaces (not cleavage) fractured in a regular pattern.     Sub Conchoidal   Fractures developed in brittle materials characterized by semi-curving surfaces.     Sectile   Curved shavings or scrapings produced by a knife blade, (e.g. graphite).     Splintery   Thin, elongated fractures produced by intersecting good cleavages or partings (e.g. hornblende).     Sugary   Fracture surfaces produced by finely aggregated minerals, (e.g. massive anhydrite).     Tough   Difficult to break apart as shown by fibrous minerals and most metals.     Unknown   Minerals too small to observe fractures.     Uneven   Flat surfaces (not cleavage) fractured in an uneven pattern.     Weak   Hard to handle without causing serious harm or damage.     Hardness would refer to actually how hard the mineral is.    Mineral Hardness  Definition   Hardness is measured by the resistance which a smooth surface offers to abrasion. The degree of hardness is determined by observing the comparative ease or difficulty which which one mineral is scratched by another.    Table showing Mohs' relative hardness scale. Mohs' original hardness values are highlighted in yellow. The selection of mineral species for hardness standards is based on the common availability of the mineral.

If it were extinct the entire mountain would be sinking, and it would eventually form a caldera instead of being in the framiliar triangle shape of an active/dormant volcano.  If the rock is still pushed up that indicates there is still hot magma close to the surface in that area.  When that molten material is gone a giant void is left under the volcano which causes the mountain to collapse into it forming a sort of bowl shape that is called a caldera.

baee058f8bbabd9f447844fdff4a370faa	Slumbering Giant  Bet you thought that the biggest mountain was Mount Everest! If you haven't already checked it out here at "Extreme Science", Mount Everest does hold a world record, but not as the biggest mountain. Everest is the highest elevation on land, but it is only a single peak in an entire mountain range. Mauna Loa is a single mountain on the island of Hawaii. The island of Hawaii is actually an island made up of five volcanoes which "blend" together because of their closeness to each other, making a single island.     Only about 13,448 ft/4100m of Mauna Loa are above sea level, so it may not seem like a very tall mountain. But, when you start measuring Mauna Loa from its true base on the bottom of the ocean, in the Hawaiian Trough, the total height exceeds that of Everest by over 3/4 of a mile. Mauna Loa is Hawaiian for "Long Mountain", probably because of its long, gently sloping shape. If you want to get really technical, Mauna Kea, a neighbor of Mauna Loa on the same island of Hawaii, is actually the tallest mountain in the world. Mauna Kea is about 350 ft/107m taller than Mauna Loa, but its mass doesn't compare to that of Mauna Loa. Mauna Loa takes up a lot of space because its mass is 9,700 cubic miles/40,000 cu km of mountain.    Mountain Born of Fire   What makes Mauna Loa such a big mountain is the way it was formed. As part of the Hawaiian islands, Mauna Loa is a volcano, just like many others found on the island chain. The volcanoes in the Hawaiian islands are different from the cone-shaped, explosive, "fire breathing" dynamos that most of us think of when volcanoes come to mind. Mauna Loa is one of many shield volcanoes that make up the Hawaiian Islands. These are volcanoes that, compared to their more violent companions, erupt slowly and quietly. What really distinguishes a shield volcano is its shape - they are usually much wider than they are tall. Shield volcanoes are created when red hot lava oozes out from cracks, or fissures in the earth's crust.    The biggest mountain in the world, Mauna Loa, is a shield volcano with gently sloping sides.     In the case of the Hawaiian islands, the fissures were in the ocean floor. The lava cools as it comes in contact with the ocean water. The newly deposited lava raises the level of the ocean floor just in the area around the fissure (see Figure 1). Over time, and many oozing eruptions, a gently sloping sea mount forms (see Figure 2). A sea mount is, quite simply, a mountain on the floor of the ocean, only the top doesn't reach above the surface. Over a million years, or more, lava slowly builds up the sea mount until the top reaches above the surface of the sea. When this happens, it finally earns the title of island (see Figure 3).    Hot Spots  About 30 years ago a Geophysicist named J. Tuzo Wilson came up with an idea to explain why there was volcanic activity out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, in the middle of the huge Pacific Plate. At the time, scientists thought that volcanoes only happened at plate boundaries, but nobody could explain why they were happening out in the middle of a tectonic plate. The idea of plate tectonics said that the earth's crust is made up of plates that are constantly moving around. The Pacific Plate is a hunk of the earth's crust that is covered by the entire Pacific Ocean.     Dr. Wilson said that there are "hot spots", under the earth's crust in some places. These are called "hot spots" because they are places where a lot of heat is concentrated in a small area. The heat causes the overlying rock to melt, forming magma (what lava is called before it is expelled from the crust - see Figure 3). Since the magma is liquid and is lighter than the surrounding rock it "floats" to the surface and forces its way out of fissures in the crust. Over time, the continual outpouring of magma can form a sea mount or island volcano if the hostpot is under the ocean floor, as in the case of the Hawaiian Islands. There is just one hot spot that never moves. But the Pacific Plate continually (and slowly) moves north over the hot spot, forming a new volcano on the overlying plate each time.      Mauna Loa (19.5N, 155.6W)  Elevation: 13,681 feet (4,170 m)  Last update: June 19, 2003    Mauna Loa is the largest volcano on Earth with an estimated volume of 9,600 cubic miles (40,000 cubic kilometers). It makes half of the area of the Island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa began to form nearly a million years ago. There is a caldera, Mokuaweoweo, at the summit and rift zones extend to the northeast and southwest. Mauna Loa is in the shield-building stage and is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth, erupting 15 times since 1900. The last eruption was in 1984 and sent lavas within 4 miles (6.5 km) of Hilo. This photograph looks to the southwest to the northeast rift of Mauna Loa. Volcano Village is in the foreground. The summit of Kilauea volcano is left of center. Photograph by J.D.

2LHcmYmuaa	Crystals are solids that form by a regular repeated pattern of molecules connecting together. In some solids, the arrangements of the building blocks (atoms and molecules) can be random or very different throughout the material. In crystals, however, a collections of atoms called the Unit Cell is repeated in exactly the same arrangement over and over throughout the entire material.        Because of this repetitive nature, crystals can take on strange and interesting looking forms, naturally. When we grow crystals we are separating all the building block molecules into individual units in water and letting them fall naturally into their appropriate place in the repetitive structure as the water evaporates.|`|13998de52bef0846bdb77dcb080e6b89aa	What is a Crystal?

But in a crystaline section, they're lined up together, much like in a pack of spagetti before you cook them. Without going into too much detail the crystalline structure is stronger because it meets at more regular points (as opposed to a jumbled mess)    Here's Wikipedia's definition:  'a crystal is a solid in which the constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern extending in all three spatial dimensions.'
2LHcmYmuaa	Crystals start growing by a process called "nucleation". Nucleation can either start with the molecules themselves or with the help of some solid matter already in the solution     Crystals usually form from molten rock as the molten  rock gradually cools.  If the molten rock  cools very rapidly, then either small crystals  form or no crystals form.  An example of this  is when lava is ejected from a volcano.  If  molten rock cools slowly, then large crystals  can form.  This happens usually when the molten  material is very deep in the Earth.  Examples  of these types of crystals are diamonds, emeralds,  rubies, etc.     Crystals can also form when water evaporates.  For example, salt crystals (sodium chloride) form  when salt water evaporates.

Let us now imagine that light quanta falls on a black body,   and  it absolutely absorbs this light quanta   ( it means light quanta stops).   Then, according to the Lebedev,s law, light quanta   renders pressure on the black body: E/c.   Therefore it is possible to write: mc=E/c.

There is an awful lot of the stuff in space.  Have you seen the picture of the Eagle nebula as taken from Hubble?  Huge pillars of dust, with some bright sparks glowing inside them. Well those sparks are stars, which gives you an idea of the scale, and the amount of dust in this one small part of the galaxy.  So a lot of the light from the galactic core is blocked by dust.    Please note, I'm not 100% certain about this - there may be other factors.  For instance, a common question in astronomy is why the night sky isn't ablaze with starlight, since the universe is infinite and full of stars.  Distance and other factors come into play here.

n1FgsVnoaa	The sea wasp, also called the Australian box jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri), which can have as many as 60 tentacles, each as long as 15 feet. Each of these tentacles has over 5000 nematocysts, stinging cells, and enough toxin to kill 60 humans. So in total, a box jellyfish has the toxin to kill over 3600 humans!    The Australian Institute of Marine Science calls the sea wasp "the most venomous marine animal known". Its sting causes excrutiating pain (likened to being on fire), and can lead to death in less than three minutes if not immediately treated. The chances of surviving its sting if you are swimming alone are pretty much nil - the pain is so overwhelming that you would likely go into shock and drown before you could even make it to shore.     Sea wasps have caused an estimated one hundred human deaths in Australia in the past hundred years. To put that in perspective, sharks kill on average 1.2 humans per year in Australian waters.

Vgqixvzdaa	This is a method that works as long as two of your sides are going to be parallel- Draw a rectangle as wide as one of your parallel side lengths and with a  length equal to what you want the distance across the hex to be. Then create a circle centered on one of the corners having a diameter equal to the side you want to create there. Go to the corner next to it (on the rectangle's "length" side) and create a circle there with a diameter equal to the length of the third side you want to create. Where the two circles intersect is where the corner will be. Snap lines from the corners of the rectangle to this point, erase the circles and your hex is half done. I'm sure you can handle it from there. A truly irregular- no equal or parallel sides- hex would be more difficult. For that I would try estimating the size of the circle that the hex could be inscribed in and then creating the sides from corner to corner on the circle- it might take several tries to get it right. hope this helps.|`|d22d9216e80e3e8a186f1de51f412d8caa	Yeah mctruck is right.

The stick frorms a right triangle with its shadow and the "line" in the air between the top top of the meter stick and the tip of the shadow.  This means that if the angle of elevation from the sun (the angle of the triangle near the tip of the shadow) is x, then tan(x) = 1 / 0.4 = 10/4 = 5/2.    The angle of the sun has to be the same for the tree.  Using the same type of triangle construction, tan(x) = height of the tree / length of shadow, so 5/2 = h / 5.

t0FVaBqIaa	I believe almost all are faked or exaggerated.  Ratings are the key for TV programs.  I do paranormal investigations and I would say there is 97% of nothing mixed with 3% sheer excitement.  That does not make for exciting television.  My favorite show is A Haunting.  It recounts people's testimonies to alleged haunted experiences.  Ghosts are real.  I have witnessed physical sightings and have had a multitude of unexplainable occurrences.  Those are very rare though.  Capturing them on film is even more rare.  I have nothing that I could look anyone in the eye and tell you 100% I captured a ghost on film or video.  EVP's are much more common.  These shows really try to stretch the authenticity of their evidence.  GHI is probably the worst.  GH is beginning to stretch the boundaries of real evidence as well.  They used to debunk their stuff very well, but not anymore.|`|AA11673762	Some shows aren't very well done or convincing, (too much cussing), but I  think 'A Haunting' is the best of the bunch.

Nothing but camera tricks.|`|HQ0OKwc2aa	Long time ago, on our little planet there was a show about real ghosts, yet no one remembers it these days, I don't even remember it. Then different TV stations sensed huge moneys from this kind of shows, so they gathered a team, with a psychic of course (umm, OK, at least some of these shows have a psychic in the team), find a haunted house (so called haunted, mostly the subject of an urban legend), then go there, shot some photos, record some sounds and air it when whole family is eating dinner.    I'm a SciFi shows reviewer and I know how TV stations work in case of sci-fi series, it's nearly the same in case of paranormal shows. Real "ghost hunting" or paranormal investigations aren't that exciting, you're sitting and waiting, sometimes trying to experiment with Electronic Voice Phenomenon, sometimes just observing, most of the time you're not using a camera or camcoder - there's no reason for that. Let's just say this, if you're not interested in parapsychology, such investigation will be just boring. And TV don't like boring things, so they can't show real investigation, they have to show you an excitement, show entertaiment, and some "real" ghosts. So no, these TV shows aren't showing the real stuff.|`|xTxfmGxDaa	Most things like that on tv are fake, the only one I find believable is John Edwards but that's about it.

In other words the History channel, the Sci-Fi channel actually air them (in some cases produce them).    However, TV shows are done mainly for entertainment purposes and ratings. An actual documentary with interviews with actual scientist (even parapsychologist) about well controlled investigations where normal explanations are found 90% (maybe higher) of the time is unlikely to make  a good show.    The shows themselves are usually clear about when they are reenacting reports of witnesses which are true accounts at least of what people report experiencing.    So, I suggest taking the shows as examples of what might be possible but not as the final explanation for any event.

So if this were the case, you have 10% interest the first year, so you would take 10% of the initial funds ($4500 * 10% = $450) and add it on to the total, which would now become $4950. Then the second year you would take the 10% of the new total since it is compound interest ($4950 * 10% = $495), and add it to the total. The new total would be $5445.

When you close the valve, less oxygen is allowed to burn with the fuel and it is incomplete combustion. This makes a yellow flame and produces H2O, CO, CO2, and C
wBbasieQaa	The interior and exterior angles add up to 180. Therefore if the interior angle is 135, the exterior is 45.    For any regular polygon, the exterior angle E multiplied by the number of sides N is always going to be 360. The way I remember this is to think of a turtle walking the edges, and at each corner he turns by E. There will be N corners, and by the time he returns to his starting point he should have done a full circle.    EN = 360  45 N = 360  N = 8    The polygon is an octagon. However, there is no way to know the length of each side unless you have additional information, like if the polygon inscribes a circle with a certain radius, or has a certain area, etc.    If the octagon inscribes a circle of radius r, then you can draw an isosceles triangle between two adjacent corners and the center. The center angle is 45. Split the triangle in half to form a pair of right triangles. Then the side s is easy to find:    s = 2r sin(22.5)    If the octagon circumscribes a circle, then s = 2r tan(22.5).    If the only other piece of info you have is the area of the octagon, each isosceles triangle should be s^2 cot(22.5) / 4, so the total area A = 2s^2 cot(22.5). You can solve for s and get s = sqrt(A tan(22.5) / 2).

zFsTSrOcaa	For brown vs. blue eyes, the short answer is that the brown-eyed parent has a 50-50 chance of transmitting either gene.  If brown is transmitted, it will be dominant and the eyes will be brown; if blue is transmitted, they eyes will be blue.  There are therefore equal chances for blue and brown eyes.    As you point out, though, eyes don't just come in one shade of brown and one shade of blue.  This means that eye color is not simply determined by one gene.  If there are multiple genes in play, each having a different effect on eye color, then the range of possible eye colors increases greatly.  This also makes it much more difficult to predict the color of someone's eyes based on the parents' eye colors.|`|tbrvyLb0aa	Ok, I'm pretty sure eye color isn't as simple as a punnet square. A brown-eyed person could carry genes for both blue & green & brown (I think.) And no, the darkness of the blue doesn't matter as much... I think it would matter more what color of eyes other people in the family have (their parents and siblings.)   My dad has light-brown eyes and my mom has hazel eyes- my older sister's eyes really seriously kind of change color... they look blue if she's wearing blue, or green, or gray. And don't anyone suggest that my mom slept around. I have dark brown eyes by the way.
GGMKhDf5aa	Now, you know that the ratio that H2 reacts with ammonia produced is 3 to 2. And you know that Avogadro's number is 6.02*10^23, which is the number of molecules in 1 mole of something. So:    7.42*10^/4 g H2 times   2.02g H2/1 mol H2 times   3 mols H2/2 mols NH3 times   6.02*10^23 molecules NH3/1 mol NH3   = 1.35*10^21 molecules NH3|`|965Qh5YAaa	First convert grams to moles by dividing by the molecular weight of H2 (2.02).  Since 3 moles of H2 are needed to make 2 moles of NH3, multiply this answer by 2/3. This gives you moles of NH3.  Then simply convert moles to molecules by dividing by Avagadro's Number (6.022*10^23 molecules per mole)

jto3YOQJaa	if we consider what a unit of CsF would look like, we would notice that one side (namely the "Cs" side) would have a much larger electron density than the other side: the "F" side.    this imbalance of having more electrons on one side than the other determines poles and thus the property of "how much polarity".|`|3BSsEQIXaa	polar bonds are from the difference in the electro negativity of the atoms involved.    fluorine is the most electronegative element and cesium is the least, so the combination of these two would form the most polar bond|`|965Qh5YAaa	This question has to do with the electronegativity of atoms (Their willingness to hold a negative charge).  Fluorine is the most electronegative of any element, while Cesium is the least electronegative element.  This difference causes the two to have a very polar bond, where the electronegative Fluorine accepts a large amount of electron density from cesium.  All these gases on the list have similar bonds (A halogen bonded to an alkali metal), but Cesium and Fluorine have the greatest difference in electronegativity, so the have the greatest polarity.

B5beZO9paa	First I drew a circle for a circular plasmid that is 4.3 kb in size.  I placed the first SAII cut at the 12 o'clock position.  I placed the second cut at the 7 o'clock position.  These cuts generate the 2.3 kb fragment.  The third SAII cut I placed at 11 o'clock.  Between the 7 o'clock cut and the 11 o'clock cut represents the 1.8 kb fragment and the 0.25 kb fragment is found between 11 o'clock and the first cut at 12 o'clock.  Then I placed the Hhall cuts.  The first of three cut the 2.3 kb fragment into the 1.2 kb and 1.1 kb fragments found in the double digest.  The remaining two Hhall sites fall in the 1.8 kb fragment.  These two cuts are what produces the .77, .70, and .35 kb fragments.    This is a bit of a challenge to answer without being able to draw a diagram.  I hope this helps.

zFsTSrOcaa	Mummification was traditional in ancient Egypt for everyone, not just royalty or the wealthy.  It is estimated that roughly 700 million Egyptians were mummified over several thousand years.    Most of the mummies were not protected by elaborate tombs and were taken for use as medicine (mummy powder was thought to be a cure-all) or fertilizer, or for their linen wrappings.  The relatively few recent finds have come from tombs which remained hidden from graverobbers and could only be afforded by the wealthy.

ZySFr8btaa	His principle says that pressure only affects the gasses, nothing else, so that is where you are probably getting that idea from.    So if you added solid carbon, the equilibrium would move to the right because it is getting rid of having excess reactants.    If you decreased the pressure it would move towards the products as there are more "volumes" of gas on that side, and decreased pressure moves to the side with less volumes.    Get in touch if you want more help.|`|ossCVxPqaa	Le Chatelier's principle applies to the equilibrium reaction you give, containing the solid C. Add more C, or for that matter more CO2 and the reaction will move to the right. Adding more reactants causes a shift to the products.    In pressure: The volume of the solid is not taken into account*. At equilibrium, you have 1mol CO2 on the left and 2mol CO on the right. This then follows le Chatelier,: If you increase the pressure, it will move to the left and if you decrease the pressure, it will move to the right.    * You will remember that in calculating Kc for equilibrium reactions, the molar concentration of solids is ignored.|`|GtVrV9iyaa	I'm not too sure on what would happen if carbon was added, although I'm relatively confident that decreasing the pressure would shift the reaction to product side. This is because the product is two moles of CO, which should occupy more volume than one mole of CO2 (to compensate for lowered pressure). Le Chatelier's Principle states that the equilibrium will shift to counteract stresses, so it would shift to the side with more moles (the volume occupied by solid carbon is negligible).

f1beDbKIaa	So there's alot more light.  Specifically, if the secondaries are nearly the same percentage obstruction, then the 16 inch has 1.8 times the light gathering area.  It takes a factor of 2.5 to get an additional magnitude.  So while you'll get more light, it's not dramatic.  You will be able to see, for example, more stars, since each magnitude does something like double the number of faintest stars you can see (in dark skies).  You'll also get some resolving power - about 1.3 times better.  This will help with planets, which have details to show.  It will also help with DSOs.    The three things you need to consider when buying a scope are Price, Portability, and Performance.  While you'll get more performance from a 16", and the numbers will tell you if you can afford the price, portability can sneak up on you.  What's the heaviest piece and can you lift it.  Will it fit in your car?    I recently got to compare my 10" to a 16" Lightbridge.  The skies weren't as clear as i'd have liked, and the light pollution, while not as bad as at my house, weren't awesome either.  We looked at a number of objects, and they were very similar. Brighter in the 16", and with some more detail. In particular, we used somewhat higher magnification in the 16".  This was helped by both the light gathering, as higher magnification dims faint extended objects, and by the higher resolving power. We were mostly using 2" eyepieces with wide fields of view in both scopes, so there was FOV to burn. And still, i expected better.  Perhaps in better weather under darker skies, the performance difference would have been more dramatic.    My club has a 22" Dob.  It takes 3 people about 20 minutes to set it up.  If i owned it, i'd never use it.  The club provides other people who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic.  If i owned it, i'd have to drag people kicking and screaming to help.  It's very nice, but it's nicer still at the club.  I get to use it about 4 times a year, and it's always a treat.    If you're cool with these issues, i'd say go for it.|`|UptQ1JFZaa	A definite step up, but depending on how much it costs it might not be enough of one to warrant the cost unless you have a bad case of aperture fever|`|5al0K3N0aa	There is a lot more aperture with the 16", but it'll be so much larger physically as well.

Case 1:  n = 1    (x - 1) = 1(x - 1) and so (x - 1) is divisible by (x - 1)    Case 2:  Assume the result for n = k    x^k - 1 = C(x - 1) --- (1)    We now need to prove x^(k+1) - 1 = D(x - 1), for some integer d  0    x^(k+2) - 1 = x^k * x - 1  = [C(x - 1) + 1] * x - 1, using (1)  = Cx2 - Cx + x - 1  = Cx(x - 1) + (x - 1)  = (Cx + 1)(x - 1)  = D(x - 1), as required, as D = Cx + 1 is a positive integer provided C and x are positive integers    So, the result is true for n = k + 1 if it is true for n = k.    Case 1 proved the result for n = 1  Using this fact an applying case 2 with k = 1 proves the result for n = 2.  Using this fact an applying case 2 with k = 2 proves the result for n = 3.  Continuing the recursive pattern, the result must be true for all positive integers n.    Note... this is much easier to prove without induction... simply sum the GP    1 + x + x2 + x3 + ... + x^(n-1) = (x^n - 1) / (x - 1)    Since LHS is an integer for integers x and n  1, x - 1 is a factor of x^n - 1.|`|Gsqt4ODYaa	when you divide x^n - 1, use the long division method.

Looking at the denominator and the denominator of this equation, what happens if x was 1? It would be 1 - 1 and that would equal 0. Unfortunately that is an impossibility because nothing is divisible by 0. The numerator could say pretty much any mathematical expression if it we wanted it to because this proof is dependent on the information conveyed in the denominator.    Did that help any?

d3339228e63a53e480f5bb320ea841cfaa	This is a well known modeling problem, from the 60s or 70s.      The model:    A person is approximated by a rectangular prism with a ratio of areas given by front:side:top :: 1:eta:eps.  The rain's velocity in the (x,y,z) coordinate direction is assumed to be (w, W, -1), and the person's velocity is (v, 0, 0).  The person wishes to arrive as dry as possible while traveling from one place to another in the rain by traveling in a straight line.  The amount of rain that would intersect a cross-section of the person per unit time is proportional to the area of that cross-section and the relative speed of the rain normal to that cross-sectional plane.    Rain can hit the person from three different directions: from the top, from the side, and from the front. Since the person is constrained to travel in a straight line in the x direction, the rain hitting the person from the top (along the z direction) and side (along the y direction) is independent of the person's speed, which is in the x direction. For these two dimensions, the amount of rain hitting the person per unit time (let's call it A) is proportional to the area being hit and the component of the relative velocity of the rain normal to that plane, which is also the component of the rain's velocity relative to the earth in those directions, since the person's velocity is zero in those directions. Thus, for the side and top, we get    A_(y and z) \propto |W|n + |-1|eps    Since the only variable is the person's speed, the values for these two cases is a constant. We can then define the constant    phi =|W|n + eps    The last source of rain comes from the direction of travel.  Since the person is able to choose their own velocity based on the rain's velocity, he can predict that the amount of rain hitting him per unit time in the x direction will be proportional to the rain's speed in the x direction relative to him. It is also proportional to the cross-sectional area of the person's front side.  Thus,    A_x \propto |w-v|1    The total amount of rain hitting the person per unit time is then    A \propto |w-v| + phi    Totaling over time T=D/|v|, we get    A_{tot} \propto |w-v|+phi / |v|        The answer:    If phi > w, the amount of rain hitting the person on the top and side per unit time is greater than the amount of rain hitting them from behind when standing still.  This means the direction that the rain comes down is closer to vertical.  In this case, the person would pass through the same amount of rain at any given instant, independent of the person's speed. However, if the person is running faster to their destination, the person is out in the rain less, thereby decreasing the total amount of rain hitting them. The person should thus run as fast as possible to their destination in this case.    In the other case, where phi |`|Jqg4hQyHaa	This is simpler than first impressions.  Assuming a vertical rain and only vertical and horizontal surfaces:    You have rain falling down and hitting your horizontal area, i.e., head and shoulders.  This is simply   wet.hor = C.hor* A.hor * t    You also have a fixed density of rain water in the air ahead of you.  No matter what you do, if you travel a fixed distance, you will run into a fixed amount of water on your vertical surface.  wet.vert = C.vert * A.vert  x    Since the water that hits your vertical surface is dependent only on distance and is independent of time.  And you minimize the horizontal surface by decreasing time.  Run!    Of course, if you angle your torso, you could decrease to zero the amount of rain hitting your vertical surfaces.  But you would slightly increase the rate hitting your horizontal surface.  But since these surfaces are generally smaller, you would have a net benefit.  Again, run!    *********  I figured this all out once on a very rainy day.  Only had to go a block.  Even considered the wind (but only a head wind).

Also, how long you are outside would affect how wet you got, so running changes that as well  Maybe also running into the droplets creates them to "splash", so running would make the impact more, and then they would splash, thus getting less water on you    Definately run.

Next we need to look at the total flux of rain into our box as it moves along the path:       There are two sources of water that can enter the bounds of our "person": Horizontal flux due to linear movement of the person, and vertical flux due to rain falling down.  Given that the rate of rainfall is constant, the amount of water present in the air immediately in front of our person at any given time should also be constant, meaning that the total amount of water gained due to horizontal movement should be dependent upon our path length, but not the duration of time it takes us to traverse it.      If the rain falling is also evenly distributed, then at any given time should also be independent of speed and path, and the total amount acquired should depend only on the amount of time spent out in the rain.  You could reduce this quantity by time outside, and that presumably would be done by running...so I would say under this basic model at least, running is the preferable option.|`|MtFlPUyvaa	Run leaning forward|`|AA12181625	less wet run.no end in sight.walk save your energy.|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	Let's elaborate on mef's answer slightly by combining it with Track's.  (Keep in mind, this is for a heavy rain, not a mist that is hanging in the air.)  Mef points out that the flux of rain through a rectangular person of width, w, height, h, and "depth" d, is proportional to     (whv' + vdw)t where v' is your running speed and v is the rain speed.    but t = L/v', where L is the distance you need to go, so the flux is proportional to:    whL + (v/v')dwL    Here we can see that the faster we go, the more we cut down on the vertical flux, whilst the horizontal remains constant.    If our person now bends forward so that they are wider at the top, say 1/2h, and assume for this argument that 1/2h >>d.  This means that you would collect no lateral rain until you are running at the speed of the rain, until then the amount of rain collected would be proportional to    (v/v')(1/2h)wL     So, if (v/v')(1/2h)     which is likely, unless you're out there hobbling with your walker, I second Track's advice.

AA10655250	Here are the definitions for Latitude and Longitude.    Latitude, gives the location of a place on Earth north or south of the equator. Lines of Latitude are the horizontal lines shown running east-to-west on maps. Latitude is an angular measurement in degrees (marked with ) ranging from 0 at the equator (low latitude) to 90 at the poles.     Longitude, is the geographic coordinate most commonly used in cartography and global navigation for east-west measurement. A line of longitude is a north-south meridian and half of a great circle.

GGMKhDf5aa	Anything with H can only develop a sigma bond, because H only has 1 electron to share, so it can only pair up once. However C-O bonds vary between certain CO compounds. CO has a triple bond between C and O. CO2 has two double (or pi) bonds between the C and 2 O's. That, or it can have 1 single and 1 triple, which would be called resonance. So on and so forth. But remember, there are no quadruple bonds within anything.

Ob9AZnA4aa	The middle of the cell membrane is composed of hydrophobic tails. Hydrophobic means "water fearing," which is why they are placed towards the middle where they do not touch water. Towards the ends are hydrophilic heads "water loving" which is why they are towards the outside. Also towards the middle of the membrane contain integral proteins that allow the passage of solute, and ions through passive or active transport, which is a whole other thing.     Basically just know that since there are hydrophobic tails, there are certain molecules that cannot easily pass through the membrane. This makes the membrane semi-permeable meaning not everything passes through. Kind of how the bouncer of a club works. Small organic molecules can readily pass through. As molecules get larger, it is tougher to pass. Also anything with hydroxide (OH) or hydrogen bonds must use 5 kcal of energy per mole of solute to get rid of their hydrogen bonds (which hold onto the outside water) to pass through. The top paragraph should suffice, but this is just extra info in case.|`|bqoEOO8Waa	The cell membrane is made up of phospholipids( another form of fats)  It is a bilayer of phospholipids, so the answer to your question is hydrocarbob tails.

Instead; lets say one is Resistor A, with a resistance of Ra, and the other is Resistor B, with the resistance of Rb.      Then the current in Ra is ...  I = V/Ra    and the current in Rb is ...  I = V/Rb      Note, if there were other resistors in the circuit (like a resistor in series with these two), then you would have to make a parallel equivalent resistance and then go back and calculate the current in the two individual resistors.    In this case, lets say the current found in the equivelent parallel resistor is Ip, then you use a "Current Divider" (which is similar to a voltage divider) to find the current in the two individual resistors, or ...    Ia = Ip * [Rb/(Ra+Rb)]    and...    Ib = Ip * [Ra/(Ra+Rb)]    ~|`|nM7xmhgiaa	The two resistors carry I1=V/R1 &  I2=V/R2  Total current = I1+ I2

bqoEOO8Waa	The 3:1 ratio is just a round up. Between 1856 and 1863 Mendel cultivated and tested some 29,000 pea plants (i.e. Pisum sativum). But the real ratio is around 2.8 or 2.9 since he used such a big big of plants to experiment, it futher increases the accuracy of his test.    Homozygous dominant means the offspring will have that phenotype expressed. Eg. AA  Homozygous recessive : will not have the phenotype expressed Eg.aa  For plants, if the genotype for long leaves is dominant (A) then the homo recessive plants will have short leaves(aa).    For hetero, they dominant allele will be expressed. Eg (Aa) : long leaves.  However, there're cases like incomplete and codominant where you see pink leaves or both red and white leaves on the same plant.    Another example is white cow, brown cow and roan cows.    Mendel's two laws explained meiosis because it shows independent assortment of the during the metaphase and there is crossing over btw  non-identical sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. (All these happen in meiosis resulting in variation)
f1beDbKIaa	I guess my main concern is that the stability of the mount, and the capability to cope with a heavy camera in the future.  Certainly these scopes can be balanced with a heavy camera.  That is, the whole scope can be shifted down in the bands to rebalance the rig.  And if the thing sways in the least breeze, perhaps the cheap solution is to buy an observing tent.  These are like those dome tents, but with an opening at the top.    Of the two, the SVP8 looks as if the mount will be better when upgraded.  It's a guess from the specs, not from direct experience.    One of the things bandied about the club is to get a smaller scope to bring the weight down so that a smaller, cheaper mount will be able to cope with it.  The idea is that you can always take a longer exposure.  But i'm of two minds on this.  Small ED or APO refractors are expensive, more expensive than these reflectors.  One of the guys has an 85 mm APO that was about $3,000.  He gets great results from it, but it was $3,000.  And this is $3k of a $20k setup. There are $500 ED refractors, but that's without a mount.  And, an 8 inch scope will be a better visual scope, especially for deep sky objects than a smaller scope. It will never be as good for imaging bright planets than a $500 ED, but it will be quite good.  And perhaps an offset mask will get you bright planets after all.

The meteorites have preserved the previously interstellar stardust grains since that time. Stardust is a scientific term rather than a poetic one, referring to refractory dust grains that condensed from cooling ejected gases from individual presolar stars. Many different types of stardust have been identified by laboratory measurements of the highly unusual isotopic composition of the chemical elements that comprise each stardust grain.

The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world.    These predictions are scare tactics, conspiracy theories, and chances to make money from books and movies.    Ever since the Y2K and 6/6/6 (June 6, 2006) End of the World scenarios did not pan out, the scare mongers, conspiracy theorists, book sellers, and television executives have been touting the 2012 End of the World scenario. When 2012 does not happen either, I am sure they will think of something else.    "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)    Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.    The early Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it may be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.    The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for our 100 X great-grandchildren.    Do not worry about the end of the world. Trust God to make sure everything happens to plan. Just be ready to meet God at any time.

This date figures prominently in the religious syncretism of New Age Mayanism.|`|W2suykEtaa	what will happen?    I will tell you what will happen.    Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies!

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

The 5,000 year old Mayan calendar when overlapping the 6000 year old Hebrew calendar aligns up with interesting occurrences at both the beginning and the end. The Mayan calendar begins in the year 666 of the Hebrew calendar; the year 1998 is multiple of 666 times three, while in the Hebrew calendar the letters made to compose the date 5758 could be rearranged to read word Nochus/Serpent.    How will the celestial alignment with the center of the galaxy-known as the mouth of the serpent-which will happen in the year 2012 effect the earth? Some say the world will end, but that is ridiculous because God, the Creator has made many promises about the future that must come true-not for a few, but for us all. There is promised to be a thousand years of peace called the Thousand Years of Woman beginning in 228 years after the event of 2012.    Since the Mayan calendar begins on the year 666 in Hebrew calendar and ends in 2012 of the Roman calendar and 5772 of the Hebrew calendar with 228 years until the end of the Hebrew calendar all begs to be interpreted. The Creator uses numbers and events to send messages to the beloved creation. The number 666 added together makes the word Chai/Life it is the life energy of sexuality which culminates once in each thousand year period.    The year 5000 which occurred three-quarters of a millinium ago was the beginning of the time period known as Ysod/Foundational Secret when all the secrets of the world come out-the beginning of the Renaissance. In every 1000 year period there is an occurrence of the 666 the last happenstance of 666 happened in 1906 and for a hundred years has been playing out until 2006 when the regime fell. Six year later, 2012, the Mayan calendar ends.    In 2012 the Hebrew calendar will ascend to its highest point-5772; the number 72 is indicative to the essence of the human being. The 228 years left until the year 6000 which will constitute the beginning of the seventh and final millennium culminating in the ascension of the united human soul to a new planet-can also be interpreted. Written out in Hebrew the number 228 comprised the word Karachim/Fissures. The year 2012 is an opening, but after the window is closed there still remains a wall between Creator and creation.    By 2012 government will be in the hands of the people and all that stands between the human being and God will be religion; the wall of religion pens us in with dogma and guilt. To bring down religion only requires fissures in the wall; because of its innate weakness religion will fall of its own. Through the fissures in the wall the human soul will merge with the human body; as the resplendent human spirit radiated from the celestial human soul comes to the earth the closer to the Creator we will all become.|`|KHjYq2bHaa	If something drastic was going to happen, wouldn't you think our world governments do something?

0DwHIBUbaa	There are a number of test for the approximate normality of a small sample. One of the best is to use 'Rankits' - see Wikipedia article.    The alternative hypothesis H1 is that the mean is either bigger or smaller than three, so the test statistic must be two-tailed.    As there is no population standard deviation known, it must be estimated from the data, so a degree of freedom is lost when using the mean of the sample to calculate it. (we are not sure that 3 mm IS the population mean yet)    't' for the sample is calculated as (mean of sample - 3.0)/(s.d. from sample) because the 't' distribution is a standardised form of the distribution of differences-of-sample-means-of-n-items from a parent Normal distribution mean.

7X6HxaSmaa	Atoms don't exist.  Stay with me, my story gets better.  Atoms, or atomos from the greek means uncuttable.  Democritus saw that that while you may have a collection of something, their sameness varied. If for example you have some gravel of the same kind of rock, each pebble will have a different size, but seem like they could be classified similarly. If one crushes the rock, the rock dust still has properties of the rock that was crushed.  So the thought there is that there was a principle element that were small, that could not themselves be divided, to make up other things.  If we do this with salt, we can reach an individual molecule of NaCl that still has the properties of what we call salt. But if this is split, it no longer has those properties.  In similar manner you can take a uranium atom (atom in the modern sense) and with the outside influence of a neutron or so the Uranium atom will undergo fission, creating an uncertain number and variety of daughter atoms which do not resemble uranium, but to be fair are more difficult to recreate uranium with. Our modern atoms themselves are a collection of protons, neutrons and electrons in a stable configuration.  These protons, neutrons and electrons are, as we have learned from particle collision experiments constitute of subparticles called quarks, are currently known in 6 varieties. And at this point science has yet to subdivide them. So does the greek idea of atoms exist? Maybe so, although we would be tempted to call quarks atoms, with the feeling we are following some kind of moving goal post. Modern atoms are merely stable collections of lesser particles, of sufficient number that scientists feel comfortable using that adequately describe the universe.  This is an issue of notation and convenience, and while remarkably predicts observable properties of an object, dishearteningly do little to answer "what is this object made of?"  Atoms are abstract categorical response to an existential question.|`|42223372622a38f2018e30c03299ab0eaa	You cannot prove and disprove the same statement without contradicting yourself.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	If atoms didn't exist why would there be such hope for the Hadron Collider & the progression of science?

Q2sZhNmJaa	Dry ice is created when carbon dioxide is compressed and frozen. The ice is extremely cold and should not be handled by direct human contact. The ice is a great tool for keeping other things cold and for creating a misty fog for a special event. If you need a large amount of dry ice your best bet is to buy some at the store. If you only need a small amount there are some things you can do at home to make dry ice if you follow these steps.    Materials:  Carbon dioxide extinguisher  Small cloth bag   Duct tape  Gloves  Tongs    Prepare for dry ice handling. Dry ice is dangerous and can cause harm to the skin. Be sure to avoid touching the dry ice once youve created it by having heavy duty work gloves and tongs on hand before you get started.   Attach the cloth bag to the carbon dioxide extinguisher. Use the duct tape to secure the bag around the nozzle of the extinguisher.   Press the handle to deploy the extinguisher. The compressed carbon dioxide will quickly spray into the cloth bag. You should notice the can of the extinguisher getting cold and mist coming out of the bag as the carbon dioxide evaporates.   Open the bag to reveal your dry ice. Once you have expelled the extinguisher, open the bag and you should find a small amount of white powder that looks like snow. This is the dry ice. Remember that it will continue to evaporate so you should use it quickly.To create quantities of dry ice you would need high pressure and extremely low temperatures, approximately -109 degrees Fahrenheit. The pressure needed to compress the solid form of carbon dioxide into dry ice is not something you will have at home. You can rent a dry ice maker or just by the ice directly from a commercial retailer.    http://www.howtodothings.com/hobbies/how...

2LHcmYmuaa	1. inermediate    2. Igneous rocks form when rock (magma) cools and solidifies, with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks. This magma can be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either the Earth's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of the following processes -- an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition.    3.

263d5a7540adbd78fc3bef5cdb605ff2aa	The cheetah is truly built for speed! Virtually every part of its body is adapted in some way to maximize running speed. Special paw pads and non-retractable claws provide great traction. Large nostrils and lungs provide quick air intake; a large liver, heart and adrenals also facilitate a rapid physical response. A long, fluid, greyhound-like body is streamlined over light bones. . But the great speed is very taxing physiologically. The top speed, 71 miles per hour can usually be maintained for only 200-300 yards.    Leopards are bigger than cheetahs, and they can take down bigger prey. They can take their prey up into trees to protect it from other predators that might steal their meal.

2LHcmYmuaa	Diatomyidae is a family of hystricomorphous, sciurognathous rodents found in Asia. It is currently represented by a single known living species, Laonastes aenigmamus    The genus name for the loation rock rat  , Laonastes, means "inhabitant of stone" (from Greek ? = laas = stone, gen: ? = laos = of stone and Greek ? = nastes = inhabitant). This is in reference to its presence around limestone rocks and also to the country where it was recently discovered. The specific epithet aenigmamus means "enigma mouse" (from Greek  = ?nigma and ? = mus, "mouse") referring to its unknown position among the rodents (Jenkins et al., 2004).|`|EpkQGcLLaa	Hmm I'm not sure, but since the single animal would be 'diatomys', it should be:    diatos = something referred to 'pierce' or 'cut'  mys = mouse, rat.    Generally the 'idae', from greek 'eidos' recall the fact that they are similar to the noun described before (in this case, they are "similar to mys", so mouse-like).    Since Diatomydae are an ancient family of Rodents which are very similar to mice and squirrels, maybe Biologists gave them this name because these animals used to 'pierce' or live in small holes they got to dig with their teeth in the trees.    My speech could sound logic, but as I told you, I'm not really convinced either.

2LHcmYmuaa	Most people who are infected by the the virus experience no symptoms or mild, flu-like symptoms. Those at higher risk of developing potentially serious conditions are the elderly and those with lowered immune systems.    The virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms from infection generally appear within 2-14 days after the bite of the mosquito.    West Nile virus can be very serious, leading to inflammation of the brain or inflammation and infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord    Here's how the transmission cycle works:    When a mosquito bites a bird infected with the West Nile virus, the virus enters the mosquito's bloodstream and circulates for a few days before settling in the salivary glands. When the infected mosquito bites an animal or a human, the virus then enters the host's bloodstream, where it may cause serious illness.    Although the exact mechanism of illness is unknown, West Nile virus probably enters the host's bloodstream, multiplies and moves on to the brain, crossing the blood-brain barrier  a barrier that separates the blood from the central nervous system. Once the virus crosses that barrier and infects the brain or its linings, an inflammatory response occurs and symptoms arise.|`|GIK1hFFsaa	The west Nile virus is a virus so it takes over one cell in the body and then duplicates itself to attack the body in numbers by using the energy of one cell.

There's a massive impact crater- Chixculub- on the Yucatan Peninsula which indicates that an asteroid 10 km across hit the earth, and there are breccias- a rock type- in southern North America that are believed to be tsunamites.  So, I'd say due to the angle of impact the worst tsunami ever was the  K/T boundary tsunami, hitting the southern part of North America.
2LHcmYmuaa	Air pressure is the force exerted on you by the weight of tiny particles of air (air molecules). Although air molecules are invisible, they still have weight and take up space. Since there's a lot of "empty" space between air molecules, air can be compressed to fit in a smaller volume.     When it's compressed, air is said to be "under high pressure". Air at sea level is what we're used to, in fact, we're so used to it that we forget we're actually feeling air pressure all the time!     If you've ever been to the top of a tall mountain, you may have noticed that your ears pop and you need to breathe more often than when you're at sea level. As the number of molecules of air around you decreases, the air pressure decreases. This causes your ears to pop in order to balance the pressure between the outside and inside of your ear. Since you are breathing fewer molecules of oxygen, you need to breathe faster to bring the few molecules there are into your lungs to make up for the deficit.     As you climb higher, air temperature decreases. Typically, air temperatures decrease about 3.6 F per 1,000 feet of elevation|`|LVHtKIaeaa	Atmospheric pressure is literally the result of the weight of the column of air above you.  At the top of the mountain, there is a "shorter" column of air above you than at sea level, and hence less weight, and less pressure|`|lepPOOnIaa	I am not exactly sure of exact measurements, but say the atmosphere extends off of earth about a mile, and a mountain extends 1,000 feet.  The mountain only has 4,280 feet of oxygen above it.  The oxygen's weight is more than at sea-level, because that has 5,280 feet of pressure.
2LHcmYmuaa	The lycophytes are a small and inconspicuous group of plants today, but in the Carboniferous some lycophytes were forest-forming trees more than 35 meters tall. Lycophytes are the oldest extant group of vascular plants, and dominated major habitats for 40 million years. The club mosses (Lycopodiales) are usually evergreen, and have been used as Christmas decorations, though their flammable spores and increasing rarity has made this illegal in some states. Other lycophytes, such as Selaginella, may form extensive carpets in the understory of wet tropical forests. The most significant feature of lycophytes are microphylls, a kind of leaf which has arisen and evolved independently from the leaves of other vascular plants. The microphyll has only a single unbranched strand of vascular tissue, or vein, whereas megaphylls, found in other plants with leaves, have multiple veins, usually branching one or more times within the leaf.     Sphenophytes, the horsetails, are spore producing vascular plants. They have hollow jointed stems surrounded by whorls of scale-like leaves. In addition, they have true roots, stems and leaves. Horsetails contain "silica," a gritty material that pioneers used to clean their pots and pans with. About a 150 types exist today, mostly small, while their ancestors were more tree-like. Horsetails are found in moist areas around the world.    The Pterophyta are the second largest division of the plant kingdom. There are 20,000 species of ferns compared to about 250,000 flowering plants alive today. Most ferns are herbaceous plants such as Polypodium virginianum (right) which grows in Ohio on damp rockfaces.        Among the ferns we see the first major elaboration of leaf morphology, accounting for a large part of their interest for us. Petiole and lamina are differentiated as they are in higher plants and the ferns show all possible variations on compound leaf structure. Fossil leaves from Carboniferous rocks are immediately recognizable as a ferns.

The symptoms of late Lyme disease include arthritis (painful, swollen joints) and nervous system problems. Lyme arthritis often affects only one of the large joints, such as the knee. Sometimes it may affect more than one joint. The symptoms of the nervous system disorder caused by late Lyme disease may include trouble concentrating, loss of memory, muscle weakness, and tingling and numbness in the arms and legs. However, Lyme disease rarely causes such nervous system problems.

4rY6UuDeaa	One of the most pervasive and mysterious phenomena in the universe is magnetism. As the scientist knows it, magnetism is the invisible pull that surrounds magnets, electric currents and even the electrons that circle the heart of the atom. Physicists do not wholly understand it, but they use it constantly. All the hundreds of thousands of electrical devices in the modern world have fields of magnetic force coursing through them. Any discovery that promises stronger or better controlled magnetism is immensely important to both practical industry and theoretical science. Such a discovery has just been made: four Bell Telephone Laboratories scientists* have found a new way to generate magnetic fields of fantastic strength.    Electromagnets, which are the essential parts of electric motors and many other devices, are made of coils of wire with electric current flowing through them. The stronger the current, the stronger is the magnetic field that the coils generate. But this increase in magnetic power is practicable only up to a point: ordinary metal wires, such as copper, offer resistance to electricity, and so will carry only a limited amount of current before melting. The strength of electromagnets cannot be increased indefinitely by pushing more current through the coils.    A promising escape from this difficulty is "superconductivity"the scientists' way of saying that certain materials, when cooled close to absolute zero (460F.), allow current to flow through them without the slightest hindrance, as light flows through empty space. Superconducting wires, even though very thin, can carry large currents, so coils made of them should be able to generate very strong magnetic fields. But when scientists eagerly tried this obvious trick to increase magnetic strength, they discovered that it simply did not work: magnetism itself, even if only moderately powerful, destroyed the superconductive qualities of all materials that the scientists had tried.|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...

This gives:    -x^3 - x^2 = -2.25^3 - 2.25x^2 = -16.453125    -x^3 - x^2 = .75^3 - .75^2 = -.984375    Then subtracting these, -16.453125 - ( -.984375) = -15.46875  This is answer A, negative because it's below the line.      On the TI, type in your original equation as Y1 = -3x^2 - 2x. Go to CALC, and the integral command. Type .75 for the lower limit and 2.25 as the upper limit and press ENTER.

3zMI6Ccuaa	The centripetal force acting on an object can affect a persons weight. The weight of something is the force that the object feels. For example on earth your weight is determined by the force of gravity pulling on you as well as the cetripetal force of the earth pushing you back out. Therefore on earth  (taking into account only these 2 forces) you weight would be W=Fgravity-Fcentripetal    Edit. In response to the previous replyer. Mass is not effected by force. Your mass is constant no matter where you are. However weight is dependent on force and therefore will be affected by any unbalanced forces you feel.|`|w2xsd28Qaa	i dont think that it is, and heres why.  lets say you have a bucket of water, and you're swinging it around in a cirlce, the faster you swing, the more the force is going to be.  since its weight isnt changing, and the force on your arm is, i dont think that the force is the same as the weight.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	This is a semantics question and the answer depends on your reference frame.  There are two ways of looking at this:    (1)  Inertial reference frame.  Looking at yourself from outside the rotation, there is a force on you: the force of gravity.  In orbit, this force provides the centripetal force that keeps you moving in a circle.    (2)  Rotating reference frame (you are at rest and your reference frame is rotating).  In this frame, you still experience the force of gravity.  But since your reference frame is accelerating, you feel another force--the centrifugal force.  In orbit, this force is equal and opposite to gravity, so there is no net force on you (gravity and centrifugal forces cancel), so you are effectively weightless.    Either of these methods is perfectly valid.  The second is the most convenient for keeping track of your movement within a spaceship or on the surface of the earth.  The first is convenient for tracking yourself through orbit.|`|kziv7mRAaa	Centripetal force should not be confused with central force, which includes the concept of weight, which is a measurement of the gravitational force acting on an object.    Central forces are a class of physical forces between two objects that meet two conditions: (1) their magnitude depends only on the distance between the two objects and (2) their direction points along the line connecting the centres of these two objects. Examples of central forces include the gravitational force between two masses and the electrostatic force between two charges. The centripetal force maintaining an object in circular motion is often a central force.    Dr. H

8i7f3Tfzaa	Polyploidy is the condition of some biological cells and organisms manifested by the presence of more than two homologous sets of chromosomes. Polyploid types are termed according to the number of chromosome sets in the nucleus: triploid (three sets; 3x), tetraploid (four sets; 4x), pentaploid (five sets; 5x), hexaploid (six sets; 6x) and so on.    A haploid has only one set of chromosomes. Haploidy may also occur as a normal stage in an organism's life cycle as in ferns and fungi. In some instances not all the chromosomes are duplicated and the condition is called aneuploidy. Where an organism is normally diploid, some spontaneous aberrations may occur which are usually caused by a hampered cell division.|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultrane...    http://polyploid.agronomy.wisc.edu/overv...|`|0e268d1d1e47e306487921fa572d09f7aa	If you can type it here you can type it in google.

This means that CF is inherited. A person will be born with CF only if two CF genes are inherited - one from the mother and one from the father. A person who has only one CF gene is healthy and said to be a "carrier" of the disease. A carrier has an increased chance of having a child with CF. This type of inheritance is called "autosomal recessive." "Autosomal" means that the gene is on one of the first 22 pairs of chromosomes which do not determine gender, so that the disease equally affects males and females. "Recessive" means that two copies of the gene, one inherited from each parent, are necessary to have the condition. Once parents have had a child with CF, there is a one in four, or 25 percent chance with each subsequent pregnancy, for another child to be born with CF. This means that there is a three out of four, or 75 percent chance, for another child to not have CF.  The birth of a child with CF is often a total surprise to a family, since most of the time (in eight out of 10 families) there is no previous family history of CF. Many autosomal recessive conditions occur this way. Since both parents are healthy, they had no prior knowledge that they carried the gene, nor that they passed the gene to the pregnancy at the same time.  Genes are founds on structures in the cells of our body called chromosomes. There are normally 46 total, or 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell of our body. The seventh pair of chromosomes contains a gene called the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator) gene. Mutations or errors in this gene are what cause CF. This gene is quite large and complex. Over 1,000 different mutations in this gene have been found which cause CF.    Also refer:  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutor...

They are primitive, sessile, mostly marine, water dwelling, filter feeders that pump water through their bodies to filter out particles of food matter. Sponges represent the simplest of animals. With no true tissues (parazoa), they lack muscles, nerves, and internal organs. Their similarity to colonial choanoflagellates shows the probable evolutionary jump from unicellular to multicellular organisms. There are over 5,000 modern species of sponges known, and they can be found attached to surfaces anywhere from the intertidal zone to as deep as 8,500 m (29,000 feet) or further. Though the fossil record of sponges dates back to the Neoproterozoic Era, new species are still commonly discovered.     have several cell types:        * Choanocytes (also known as "collar cells") function as the sponge's digestive system, are remarkably similar to the protistan choanoflagellates. The collars are composed of microvilli and are used to filter particles out of the water. The beating of the choanocytes flagella creates the sponges water current.      * Porocytes are tubular cells that make up the pores into the sponge body through the mesohyl.      * Pinacocytes which form the pinacoderm, the outer epidermal layer of cells. This is the closest approach to true tissue in sponges      * Myocytes are modified pinacocytes which control the size of the osculum and pore openings and thus the water flow.      * Archaeocytes (or amoebocytes) have many functions; they are totipotent cells which can transform into sclerocytes, spongocytes, or collencytes. They also have a role in nutrient transport and sexual reproduction.      * Sclerocytes secrete calcareous or siliceous spicules which reside in the mesohyl.      * Spongocytes secrete spongin, collagen-like fibers which make up the mesohyl.      * Collencytes secrete collagen.      * Spicules are stiffened rods or spikes made of calcium carbonate or silica which are used for structure and defense.      * Cells are arranged in a gelatinous non-cellular matrix called mesohyl.    Sponges have three body types: asconoid, syconoid, and leuconoid.    Asconoid sponges are tubular with a central shaft called the spongocoel. The beating of choanocyte flagella forces water into the spongocoel through pores in the body wall. Choanocytes line the spongocoel and filter nutrients out of the water.    Syconoid sponges are similar to asconoids. They have a tubular body with a single osculum, but the body wall is thicker and more complex than that of asconoids and contains choanocyte-lined radial canals that empty into the spongocoel. Water enters through a large number of dermal ostia into incurrent canals and then filters through tiny openings called prosopyles into the radial canals. There food is ingested by the choanocytes. Syconoids do not usually form highly branched colonies as asconoids do. During their development, syconoid sponges pass through an asconoid stage.    Leuconoid sponges lack a spongocoel and instead have flagellated chambers, containing choanocytes, which are led to and out of via canals.    Sponges have no true circulatory system; however the water current is used for circulation. Dissolved gases are brought to cells and enter the cells via simple diffusion. Metabolic wastes are also transferred to the water through diffusion. Sponges pump remarkable amounts of water. Leuconia, for example, is a small leuconoid sponge about 10 cm tall and 1 cm in diameter. It is estimated that water enters through more than 80,000 incurrent canals at a speed of 6cm per minute. However, because Leuconia has more than 2 million flagellated chambers whose combined diameter is much greater than that of the canals, water flow through chambers slows to 3.6cm per hour. Such a flow rate allows easy food capture by the collar cells. All water is expelled through a single osculum at a velocity of about 8.5 cm/second: a jet force capable of carrying waste products some distance away from the sponge.    Sponges have no respiratory or excretory organs; both functions occur by diffusion in individual cells. Contractile vacuoles are found in archaeocytes and choanocytes of freshwater sponges. The only visible activities and responses in sponges, other than propulsion of water, are slight alterations in shape and closing and opening of incurrent and excurrent pores, and these movements are slow.

2LHcmYmuaa	the most dangerous misconception is that anywhere on land is preferable to being on the water in a thunderstorm. Tall trees and rocky outcrops along the shore and on nearby land may be more dangerous places to be than in a boat on the water.    If possible get off the water to a safer location. Avoid transition zones: the edge of the land, isolated tall trees, high ground and open spaces. Try to get to a part of the forest with uniform shrubs or trees of uniform height. In open areas look for ditches, trenches or low ground.    If you are on the water and cannot get off to a safer location, avoid close contact with other paddlers.

Most modern canoes are constructed of electricity-conducting metal and are dangerous to be in during storms.  In addition to the canoe, being in a lake makes you a prime target because there are few taller objects that would ordinarily take the strike.|`|AA11124527	Depends on how dry the boat and you are compared to the lake, I would suppose. Before lightning strikes, a column of electrons (called a leader) works its way down from a cloud, following the past of least resistance until it encounters the earth.  Naturally, tall metal objects are attractive to a leader.  Since you're in a canoe, you'll be a little higher than the surface of the water, but the leader might not reach you (especially if you're dry) because you won't easily bridge the gap between the cloud and the lake.      If you feel your hair start to rise, however, you'd best row very quickly to shore.|`|upVukvP1aa	Yes, you can. Odds are, you are the tallest thing on the lake, and therefore the path of least resistance to the lake. Lighning requires greater voltage to discharge through greater distances of air, so it is more likely to ground at higher points. However, lightning also tends to follow more conductive materials. I've heard of sailors trailing metal cables from the shrouds of their mast into the water so lightning will go through the cables, rather than the boat itself. I suppose a similar technique could be used while canoeing, although I'd reccomend paddling to shore.|`|6d743df6f2311d9c048596d7d1910abcaa	Hi,    the answer to your question is yes, you would be in danger of being struck.    General advice for avoiding the chances of being struck are that you avoid being the highest point, or next to the highest point during a storm.  The middle of a lake, which of course is completely flat would leave you and the canoe as the highest point within the confines of the lake.    If a thunderstorm starts close to you paddle as quickly as you can to the higher ground which will be at the edge of the lake.  You are not under a great risk, as the number of people struck each year is very low...but it does happen and the middle of a lake would not be my favourite place to ride out the storm.    Don't worry too much, there isn't a great chance of it happening, but take whatever measures you can to avoid being the highest point around during any thunderstorm.    Cheers,    BobSpain

649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	Le Chateliers principle states that when a system in chemical equilibrium is disturbed by a change of temperature, pressure, or a concentration, the system shifts in equilibrium composition in a way that tends to counteract this change of variable.     The three ways that Le Chateliers principle says you can affect the outcome of the equilibrium are as follows:    - Changing concentrations by adding or removing products or reactants to the reaction vessel.    - Changing partial pressure of gaseous reactants and products.    - Changing the temperature|`|6b54ee1cd8e3412d3dd216ea2a4d4794aa	When a reaction at equilibrium is subjected to a change to its concentration, pressure, temperature, the equilibrium position will shift left or right to react to the change.|`|l2FetQ6waa	If a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, temperature, volume, or total pressure; the equilibrium will shift in order to minimize that change.
649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	Chemical equilibrium applies to reactions that can occur in both directions(reversible).    The reaction can happen both ways. So after some of the products are created the products begin to react to form the reactants. At the beginning of the reaction, the rate that the reactants are changing into the products is higher than the rate that the products are changing into the reactants. Therefore, the net change is a higher number of products.     Even though the reactants are constantly forming products and vice-versa the amount of reactants and products does become steady. When the net change of the products and reactants is zero the reaction has reached equilibrium. The equilibrium is a dynamic equilibrium.     The definition for a dynamic equilibrium is when the amount of products and reactants are constant. (They are not equal but constant. Also, both reactions are still occurring.)    There is a balance between those two opposite reactions, and we call that kind of balance a dynamic equilibrium -- equilibrium because there is a balance, dynamic because there are changes taking place.|`|7cb2736718fc8aefe05adb763ddc8293aa	Well basically it means that atoms/molecules/particles are always moving from one form to the other, from reactant to product, etc.. However, the NET amount of reactant and product is constant at equlibrium. So equilibrium isn't static, meaning that it doesn't happen and then just sit there unchanging. It's dynamic, meaning that action is always happening, even though the "big picture" seems stable.

Water vascular system|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	The answer is D. a water vascular system    info:  Echinoderms have a water vascular system|`|ohoPEHNGaa	Unique to echinoderms is the water vascular system, a network of hydraulic canals branching into extensions called tube feet.    These function in locomotion, feeding, and gas exchange.    The subphylum Urochordata contains 1,250 species of tunuicates that have gill slits. Adults have a body composed of an outer tunic with an incurrent and excurrent siphon. When they are disturbed, tunicates tend to squirt water out. Water passes into a pharynx and out numerous gill slits, the only chordate characteristic that remains in adults. Microscopic particles adhere to a mucous secretion in the pharynx and are eaten. The larvae are bilaterally symmetrical and have the three chordate characteristics. Tunicate larva metamorphose into the sessile adult. Beating of numerous cilia lining the inside of the pharynx creates a current to move water through a tunicate. Some suggest larvae became sexually mature without developing tunicate characteristics; thus, a urochordate larva was ancestral to vertebrates; or a cephalochordate larva may have been ancestral to vertebrates.

Once we allow the motor to be turning, it acts as a generator producing a voltage that opposes the applied voltage.    Almost certainly, the teacher is looking for B. 9VDC as the answer, but it could be 12 or 144, or even 0.007 if the motor is in the process of reversing direction.|`|7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	B  ///

8b24df9325c99ab13f9f6d0244219134aa	Integral ( arctan(x) / x^3  dx )    To solve this, use integration by parts.    Let u = arctan(x).  dv = 1/x^3  dx  du = 1/(1 + x^2) dx.  v = (-1/2)(1/x^2)    uv - Integral ( v du )    (-1/2)arctan(x)(1/x^2) - Integral ( (-1/2) 1/[x^2 (1 + x^2) ] dx )    Factor out the (-1/2) to get    (-1/2)arctan(x)(1/x^2) + (1/2) Integral ( 1/[x^2 (1 + x^2) ] dx )    From here it's a matter of using trigonometric substitution on the integral.  Let's solve this separately.      Integral ( 1/[x^2 (1 + x^2) ] dx )    Let x = tan(t).  Then  dx = sec^2(t) dt, so we get    Integral ( 1/[tan^2(t) (1 + tan^2(t))] sec^2(t) dt )    Integral ( 1/[tan^2(t) (sec^2(t))] sec^2(t) dt )    And we get a cancellation of the sec^2(t).    Integral ( 1/[tan^2(t)] dt )    Integral ( cot^2(t) dt )    Using the identity cot^2(t) = csc^2(t) - 1, we get    Integral ( [ csc^2(t) - 1 ] dt )    Which we can integrate easily, since csc^2(t) is almost a known derivative.  (the derivative of cot(t) is -csc^2(t), so the derivative of -cot(t) is csc^2(t) ).      -cot(t) - t    To solve this back in terms of x, remember that we let x = tan(t), so  1/x = 1/tan(t)  cot(t) = 1/x    Also, since x = tan(t), t = arctan(x).  That makes our answer    -1/x - arctan(x)    Plugging this back into our original answer, we get    (-1/2)arctan(x)(1/x^2) + (1/2) Integral ( 1/[x^2 (1 + x^2) ] dx )    Becoming    (-1/2)arctan(x)(1/x^2) + (1/2) [ -1/x - arctan(x) ] + C    Which simplifies as    (-1/2)arctan(x)(1/x^2) + (-1/2)(1/x) - (1/2)arctan(x) + C|`|43b3fc46f5e0746407f46b876475c618aa	I would do a power series expansion since arctan is a terrible function to be working with|`|cSGTA4pzaa	replace x with tan t.

a9d403effe9a7737ba695b9357633a92aa	OK, this doesn't take into account the battery storage, but here goes:    A full bath holds around 90 litres of water. Let's assume that the starting temperature is 10 deg C, and the target temp. is 35 deg C. You need to raise 90 litres of water by 25 degrees C.    1 Calorie is defined as the amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of water by 1 deg C. 1 gram of water equals 1cc, or 1ml, hence it takes 1000 calories to raise 1 litre of water by 1 degree.    So, 1000 calories X 90 litres X 25 degrees = 2,250,000 calories.    Considering that the recommended daily intake of a man is only around 2,000 to 2,500 calories, you'd need to generate around 1000 times your daily intake of energy to do it, which is impossible. And that assumes 100% efficiency in all energy transfers, which is simply never going to happen.    So the short answer is, it's simply not possible. If you tried I doubt you could heat the water faster than it would cool anyway, so I don't think you could even raise the temperature at all, even if you pedalled all day!|`|9170bd47258e0f9e57e2e56e8785bb6daa	This is best considered from the point of view that the pedal is a dynamo that creates electricity which when passed through a resistor (heater) changes that electrical energy to heat energy. that said, mechanical energy (dynamo) is directly proportional to electrical energy which is directly proportional to heat energy. so, it all depends of the amount of water needed to be warmed.  besides, it does not need to store the energy, but that is a minus since you will need energy to heat it and energy to charge the battery.  hope i helped you.|`|AA12356637	not much if you ain't peddling|`|AA11759276	How hot is hot and how deep is deep?

But you want a total volume of 10 mL.  Now you need to figure out how many mols of that compound contains in the total volume by simply multiplying 0.100 mol/L x 0.010 L = 0.00100 mol.  Now you need to figure out how many grams is in 0.00100 mol.

One liter at one molar will take 75 grams.   100 millimolar is equal to 1/10 molar. So in 1 liter that would be 7.5 grams or 1/10 of 75.

The SI units for Torque are newton meters although centinewton meters (cNm), foot-pounds force (ftlbf), inch pounds (lbfin) and inch ounces (ozfin) are also frequently used expressions of torque. The symbol for torque is , the Greek letter tau. The concept of torque, also called moment or couple, originated with the work of Archimedes on levers. The rotational analogues of force, mass, and acceleration are torque, moment of inertia, and angular acceleration respectively. The force applied to a lever, multiplied by its distance from the lever's fulcrum, is the torque. For example, a force of three newtons applied two metres from the fulcrum exerts the same torque as one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum.|`|AA11136434	TORQUE IS.......POUNDS......TORQUE 30lbs|`|56044477679db6eadf85528de53e1dc6aa	the rotational capacity of a force|`|563fedbd084d28e2c4b7735fa61c4facaa	Torque about a point is the cross product of vector joining the point of application of the force and the force  Torque = r x f|`|AA11991317	onlyafewill... answered this so well, but I just want to add my 2 inch pounds...    Torque only exists when there is resistance. Force can not be applied if there is no opposing force. Perfect torque calculations assume that the opposing/resisting force equals (or exceeds) the force applied.     ;-D There is an automotive tool similar to a wrench that has a scale near one end, against which a pointer will indicate the force applied. This scale is measuring torque. Bolts often need a certain amount of torque applied to hold the parts together without warping or braking something. Ignore proper torquing at your own expense!|`|b3e6e65071755ebbea6852800179cc7eaa	Torque is the "rotational force". It is defined as the force applied to the object times the distance from the center of rotation. If you increase the distance where you apply the force from the center of rotation, then you are increasing the torque. This is why it is easier to open a door if it has a knob farther from the hinge. If you try to open a big door using the same amount of force, it is twice as easy to do if the knob is located twice the distance from the hinge.|`|AA10299265	Okay, you wanted elaborate.

F: X -> Y    F is function if for any x e X there exists ONLY one Y, f(x)=y ... i've given you a function of X.  ... so, you can have x = -1 and x=1 and the y will be the same, but you cant have one x and two values for y ...     still, generally speaking, it's true that y is a function of x is what you get when you put y on one side, and everything else on other side. just bear in mind that some situations aren't allowed|`|8d869cdbbc071557f08a7bef26e08dc1aa	If for each x there is a corresponding value ( or even a set of values) then y is a function of x.    y +x^2-1 or y=-x^2-1  try some x's and get correspondong y's    y=(3x-1)/(x+2) let's let x=0  then y=-1/2                                  let x=1, then y=6    `etc.|`|AA10049677	when we say y is a function of x, we represent it as    y = f(x), which means any change in value of x will change the value of y    Thus, in ur first equation, y = 1 -x^2 [y = f(x)], here f(x) = 1-x^2, if x changes so does y  Similarly, in the second equation, f(x) = (3x-1)/(x+2)    In other words, if y can be represented in terms of x, we can say y is a function of x or y = f(x)    Hope this helps.|`|AA11662324	For the first problem    y is function of x( IE y changes after x changes(or varies)  for the second problem  y is function of x.

I have watched the 2012 Doomsday program on the Hysteria Channel.  If you pay attention and listen carefully, you will hear all the "weasel words" like "may be", "could", etc.  The entire program was done that way. Their "experts" didn't actually say that anything was going to happen. They didn't give any actual Bible verses to support their theory, and all the Nostradamus "quotes" weren't what he actually wrote. They were what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted. He never mentioned 2012.  Watching this program just confirmed what I already knew, that the whole 2012 hype is a silly scare tactic being put out to sell books.    There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years.   It is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  They didnt predict the end of the world, it was only the end of that cycle.  They didn't predict the end of the world, but the beginning of a new age.  Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar.   Galactic Alignment  There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.  Asteroid Apophis - the 2001 alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.  Polar Shift - the magnetic poles are moving all the time.  Polar reversals have occurred in the past, but we cant predict when they will occur again.    Passage through a "photon belt" has been added. This is also untrue and wouldn't hurt us if it were. Photons are merely units of light.    Solar flares happen all the time and we have more of them at some times than others. They occur in roughly eleven year cycles.  They have caused some electronic disruptions at times, but no serious problems. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005.

More fossil finds in the early 1800s led to further study, and the word "dinosaur" ("terrible lizard") was first used to collectively describe these fossils in 1842.|`|lLN8VD20aa	when some kid back in the early 1900 got very creative with Paper Machete.|`|MwSaCettaa	Many many Moons ago!!!    ???|`|oDGttkmLaa	It was about 50 or 60 years ago. People used to think the dinosaur bones were really prehistoric helicopters. This sounds archaic to you and me..but to those people (in the dark ages when there was no sun) it seemed perfectly rational. Obviously SOME of the bones were prehistoric helicopters..but most had teeth and so we deduced that they must be either really big dogs..or 'dinosaurs'. They were called 'dinosaurs' because the first dog was named 'dino'.|`|7G0IyCltaa	An inkling?

Prior to then, some commonly found fossils, particularly those of Protoceratops from the Campanian of Central Asia, gave rise to the legend of the griffin. One could say that due to discoveries of unusual remains, people had long had an "inkling" that dinosaurs existed.

Solve for your wavelength:  lambda = hc / mc^2    Rather than looking up planck's constant and the speed of light separately, it's handy to use hc = 1240 eV-nm and divide by the rest energy of the muon.    The momentum of a massless particle is:  p = E/c    Convert eV to joules (divide by the fundamental charge) and then your units will work out as requested.    --There are 10^9 nm is a meter.  So if your energy is in MeV and you want the wavelength in m, you have to do some conversion like so:  So hc = 1240 eV nm * (1 MeV / 10^6 eV) * (1m / 10^9 nm)

Jjl9pMiFaa	Male reproductive organs are actually found inside the body so researchers cant necessarily tell if the dolphin is male or female by just taking a quick look!    The male and female reproductive organs are actually located inside the urogenital opening. Usually if the dolphin has mammary slits it is a female; however, there have been a few cases where males have mammary slits as well! You can be sure by determining the distance between the umbilicus, genital opening and the anus. If the umbilicus, genital opening and anus are evenly spaced the dolphin is a male, if the genital opening is closer to the anus than the bottlenose dolphin is a female|`|GCw5NySKaa	yall are gay!|`|eiim3tJuaa	http://www.hpu.edu/index.cfm?contentID=9...    http://www.tangalooma.com/dolphinweb/sch...    http://www.dolphinsplus.com/dolphin-info...  How can you distinguish between a male and female dolphin?    Even though male and female genitalia are internal, its fairly easy to discriminate one from the other. On the underside of their peduncle, males have two, separate slits, or grooves. One is called the genital groove and the other the anal groove. They lie in line with each other such that the grooves of a male resemble an exclamation point. Females have one anogenital slit or groove and a mammary slit on either side (will produce milk when they are reproductively mature). Therefore, a females underside resembles more of a division sign.    http://www.dolphins.org/marineed_materni...  Gender Differences    Dolphins have no secondary sex characteristics. The only way to determine a dolphins gender in the wild is to see a clear view of their genitals, or to observe an erection, act of intercourse, or a baby swimming close to an adult presumed to be a female.    Males have two slits that look similar to an exclamation point. The long anterior slit houses the genitals, while the smaller posterior slit houses the anus. Two small pores are present on either side of the genital-anal slit, which have been considered possible vestigial nipples.    Females have one continuous slit which houses both the anal and genital openings, the anus located towards the posterior. Females also have a set of slits housing the mammary glands. These slits flank either side of the genital slit. Occasionally females will have extra false sets of mammary slits. These extra slits are generally non-functional and could be a hold over from the dolphins terrestrial ancestor.

JwPu0XbIaa	Planetary rings are bits of ice and rock orbiting a planet.  The ice and rock could be the remains of a smashed moon, or it could be ejected from a moon (like the geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus).    If there were no moons, a planetary ring would just spread out into a featureless disc, as bits of it collided with other bits.  However, the gravitational influence of the moons pulls the ring material back and forth, separating it into many rings.

Now we need another equation so we can substitute, the problem says that 1.8W=L.Now substituting into the original equation we get 2W+2(1.8W)=32, which= 5.6W=32. Divide both sides by 5.6 and theres your width.

lkHJAFICaa	The answer is C. x^2-x-2 with a remainder of -11/(x-5)    What you do is look only at x as it is divided into the larger function. what would make x be equal to x^3? by multiplying it by x^2.   So then you have x^2 times x-5 and you get x^3 - 5x^2, but seeing as how you have to subtract that (just like in regular division) it becomes (x^3-6x^2) - x^3 + 5x^2 = -x^2 and then you drop the 3x (again just like in reg division). continue this step of trying to get the x exponent equal to whatever is left under the division symbol (now -x^2) untill you are left with -11. because there is no longer an x variable, -11 becomes the remainder.

For example - Anyone with a basic knowledge of arithmetic would know the upper limit of a percentage. So much for the self-described mega-brain, whatever that might be.    Then the questioner seems to regard belief in a 1900-odd years old myth as some sort of desirable quality that has something to do with purity. This was the same sort of quality that gave rise to the Crusades and the Inquisition and a whole 1900 years of similar horrors, right up to the present. Not much purity in evidence there, then.    It is hardly surprising therefore that the questioner asks one of the few questions in science to which there can be no straightforward answer other than - we don't know, we will probably never know, we may only theorize or guess.    The problem is, that at the event horizon of a black hole, conditions become so extreme, all our means of physical measurement become worthless. In a black hole we seem to have an infinity of some kind, a hole in the very fabric of space-time, and that is just about all that, at present, we can say.    
648027ace1a4720fb2f2c005258439e1aa	There are ten gnomes who have gotten themselves into quite a   predicament. They are in the dungeon of a castle of a tyrannical king.      Despite the evilness of the king, he has a silver lining in his heart.    He has given the gnomes a chance of survival. Here is the offer:    The King lines the gnomes up in a single-file row. This means that the tenth gnome sees the back of the person in front of him, and there is no gnome behind the tenth gnome. The ninth gnome has the tenth gnome behind him and the eighth gnome directly in front of him, and so on.  Finally, the first gnome has the second gnome directly behind him, but there is no one in front of the first gnome.      The king has a large bag full of many black hats and many white hats.  There is not necessarily the same number of black hats as white hats. The king randomly reaches into his bag and places a hat on each of the gnomes. This means that the tenth gnome can see everyone's hat except his own, the ninth gnome can see everyone's hat except his own and the tenth gnome's hat, and so on. The first gnome can see no one's hat.    The king then takes out his gun and puts it to the temple of the tenth gnome. The king asks the gnome, "What color is your hat?" If the gnome answers correctly, he lives and gets freed from the dungeon. If he does not, he dies. He continues up the line in this progression.    However, before placing the hats on the gnomes, he allows the gnomes to meet as a group and discuss a strategy to save as many of the gnomes as possible. Imagine that you are one of these gnomes. What strategy would you develop? How many gnomes can you guarantee to save?      REMEMBER: When it is your turn to say the color of your hat you must ONLY say "white" or "black."  If you say anything else, the king will shoot you and all of the remaining gnomes.

It's because the perfume bottle is significantly smaller than the room, and all of the rest of the particles in the bottle are so close together, so they bump into each other more often, making them go faster, and then they bump more at their already high speeds, and so on. Whereas when they are sprayed into a room there is a lot more room and the particles can move more freely without bumping into one another.
9ea2e1cd35ec4eb78e3ab1b7124c047caa	Do you mean "regular" as in "regular expression", or just not necessarily context free?  If the latter is the case, there are lots of differences, like for instance, a context-free grammar can be written in Chomsky Normal Form.    A grammar that is not context free (called context sensitive) might have rules like:    aSa -> aba  aSb -> aab    that is, what terminal the nontermial variable S goes to depends on its context.    If you are talking about "regular" as in "regular expression", then note that a context-free grammar can generate a string with n a's followed by n b's for any positive integer n, but a "regular expression", or its equivalent grammar cannot.|`|PsO9r9Xtaa	In Timbuktu does not matter which it is.

Inelastic collisions don't conserve kinetic energy, but total momentum before and after collision is conserved.|`|xbma9SuWaa	When some outside energy is introduced into the system the momentum will not be conserverd.     Example:  One billard ball is moving towards another ...and just before it hits..your friend shoves the second billard ball towards the first.   Your friend just introduced kinetic energy into the system.  This means the momentum before collision will not be equal to momentum after

DNA encodes for most things in your body for example the colour of your eyes and hair.  You inherit half from your mother and half from your father.  The guy above got one thing wrong in that blood is not considered 'trace DNA', as trace DNA is generally invisible 'traces' from cells that are left behind when things are touched, such as when somebody snatched a bag, or it can be found on clothes that a person has worn, like a hat or a shirt.  Fibres do not have DNA.  In general, fibres in forensic science refer to non-human materials such as fabrics.  Also, DNA does not determine if a person is guilty or innocent.  It needs to be taken into context with all other eveidence.  For example, if a cap is left behind at a crime scene, and it is analysed and found to have a person's DNA on it, it does not necessarily mean that that person commited the crime.  It could be that the person who committed the crime borrowed the cap from somebody else.  Also, trace evidence is not just that transferred from criminal to victim, but also victim to criminal, from both to surrounding areas.  Pretty much from anyone to anywhere.  I hope this has been helpful.

As with any skill, some of us are born with abilities towards a particular skill. Others choose to develop a skill with discipline, dedication and determination. Then there are others less skilled in one area but very skilled another. This can be likened to body building. Some people are born very athletic and able to develop their physical muscles easily and quickly. Others, choose to develop their muscular bodies. The Intuitive muscle, or awareness, works and is enhanced much the same way. We are born with intuition! Some of us have extraordinary skills at it, and others choose to develop their full potential.    Many people enter a course of study not realizing their own potential. They are drawn into intuitive development classes because they are intrigued with the possibilities, have experienced some type of intuition or are searching for self- confidence and guidance. Most everyone is amazed and delighted when they begin to experience their own internal intuition emerge. One can experience a variety of intuitive abilities in classes with instruction, coaching and encouragement which aids development. Intuitive awareness is there. It just needs a pathway to awareness. Being validated and confirmed by others spurs us on to continue. We learn to believe in our own self.    Edgar Cayce is one of the most famed intuitives. He left us a legacy of insights, guidance and wisdom about our spiritual awareness, karmic patterns, heath connections, and intuition. He encouraged everyone to believe in and develop their connection to their own source of intuition.    Dr. Norman Shealy, esteemed neurosurgeon, author, founder and president of The American Holistic Medical Association, and director and founder of HOLOS University Graduate Seminary program, credits intuition as a new field worthy of extensive study in a university environment. Caroline Myss, author of "Anatomy Of The Spirit" and other works about intuition, health and spiritual meaning has also written and taught extensively about our intuitive awareness. Both have created a focused study of intuition and spiritual awareness worthy of degree granting and career direction. What was once called women's intuition now has been upgraded and promoted to a high level of acceptability, credibility and availability to us all.    This perceived hidden and unrecognizable intuitive awareness has been seeping into our daily lives more and more. We are searching for more meaning in our lives. More guidance to create our lives into what we dream about. We want to attract all that is great and grand and glorious for us. We all want a peaceful happy abundant purpose-filled life. We want to be free of our hidden fears, insecurities, and struggles. Learning how to release those blocks through inner awareness allows us to be clear and open to our intuition.    We are searching for new meaning and enhanced freedom in our lives. Developing our intuition is the pathway to self and to our Higher Self.    Women's intuition, which was once considered weird and unexplainable, now has a new perspective. We are beginning to hear of courses, classes, workshops and personal development seminars aimed at developing the intuitive nature. Transpersonal psychology, Intuitive Counseling, spiritual psychology , intuitive energy healing and medical intuition are a few of the courses now being offered in a variety of alternative and holistic colleges and universities. Classes and workshops are offering us a plethora of methods and training to develop our internal source of awareness a.k.a. intuition! Thus, intuition is emerging out of obscurity to a fully recognizable source of wisdom and guidance for us all.    Our intuitive muscle skills can be developed, accessed and finely tuned to enhance our lives, our decisions and our happiness and our purpose. Intuition is a locked-up source just waiting for us to open up, click on and wake up. This light-bulb awareness can begin to allow our life to work for us easily, quickly and joyfully.     Or it could all be BS. I have none so not sure.  |`|YXGdwwTJaa	Yes .    Intuition usually consists of noticing all sorts of tiny clues and working out an answer subconsciously.    You can also get a cold feeling and'goose bumps' that is hairs standing on end, just by thinking about strange events.    If you ever get a sudden sure feeling about something then it pays to act on it.  |`|3Ztt99fTaa	Mine will run cold if I cut myself right now.  I have the temp in the house set at 58.  
AA11915874	close...    essentially there is an equilibrium condition between the liquid and solid phases at the normal freezing point.  Adding a solute shifts the equilibrium to the liquid phase by lowering the chemical energy of the liquid phase via dilution.  By diluting the liquid, with the solute, the entropy of the liquid is increased.  Ice has lower entropy so the equilibrium shifts towards liquid.  At a lower temperature, the chemical potential of the liquid and solid phase is lowered to the point where the chemical potentials of liquid and solid phases are again equal.  This point is a "depressed" freezing point.

WVPYem5Vaa	Fluorescent materials absorb light of a certain wavelength. This absorbed light will excite electrons to a higher energy state. The molecules then undergo non-radiative dissipation of this energy, for example by colliding with other molecules, causing the electrons to drop to the lowest vibrational state in the excited state. Once this is done, the electron falls back to the original ground state, emitting light in the process. Because some energy was already lost due to collisions, the light emitted will be of lower energy, corresponding to a longer wavelength.    Fluorescence only occurs when the light source is present, because the excited state is a singlet state; this state is not stable.

TL1Jkqunaa	Things will burn more violently.  Slow oxidizing processes- rusting, would speed up.  It does not take a big increase in the available O2 to have a visible affect.  ANimals would grow faster, some would grow bigger, but would face aging quicker.  Excess oxygenation can destroy eyes.  This sometimes happens in childbirth now when the mother is being treated for problems during pregnancy and birth.  High oxygen under pressure is a deadly poison.

f0ed2ce5d291634d748cb1ae9b52d651aa	In general, to convert A mg/mL to B mg/mL (where A > B), the first step is  to take B mL of initial solution and make it up with water to a total of  A mL.    Your figures are A = 425 mg/mL and B = 45 mg/mL.    So take 45 mL of solution and make it up with water to a total of 425 mL.    (Note that final concentration will be : 45 mL * 425 mg/mL / 425 mL = 45 mg/mL)    But you only want to make 40 mL of new solution, so you'll need to decrease  425 mL to 40 mL by dividing 425 by the factor 425/40 = 10.625.  That is, 425 / 10.625 = 40.    So you have to decrease the 45 mL by the same proportion.  45 / 10.625 = 4.2 (after rounding)    So you take 4.2 mL of initial solution and make it up with water to 40 mL.  This requires (40 - 4.2) = 35.8 mL of water.    Thus, 40 mL of 45 mg/mL concentration is made by transferring  4.2 mL of 425 mg/mL protein solution into a flask with 35.8 mL of water.    Check calculations : Concentration = 4.2 * 425 / 40 = 44.6 mg/mL,  which is the best you can do to one decimal place.

In your (first) system the parameters are:     a = 4, b = -7, c = 10, d = 1, e = -1, f = 7, so using the above formulas we will have:     x = [(10)*(-1) - (-7)(7)) = -10+49]=39 / [(4)*(-1) - (-7)*(1)]=3 or x=39/3 or x=13,     and     y = [(4)*(7) - (10)(1)]=18 / [(4*(-1) - (-7)*(1)]=3 or y = 18/3 or y=6.     The other system can be solved in a totally similar manner .     If in this process you ever have det (a, b, d, e)=0, then the system will be either inconsistent (i.e. has no solutions), or will have an infinite number of soultions. In the former case this implies that the two lines representing the system are parallel, and in the latter case it implies the two lines are overlapping.     The Cramer's method generalizes to solving n by n systems of linear equations.

Multiply this by the molality to get moles of NaCl:  0.015 * 0.91 = 0.01365mol NaCl  The molar mass of NaCl is 58.44g  Using the molar mass we can convert moles of NaCl to grams of NaCl like this:  0.01365mol NaCl * (58.44g NaCl / 1mol NaCl) = 0.798g NaCl  So you need about 0.789g NaCl

X0e6p9Ilaa	That's the first misconception.  London dispersion forces are not necessarily the weakest of intermolecular forces.  In fact, dispersion forces can be greater than both dipole-dipole attractions and even hydrogen bonds.    You can easily tell if a molecule exhibits dispersion forces because ALL, that's A*L*L molecules exhibit dispersion forces, even when there are also dipole-dipole attractions or hydrogen bonds.    London dispersion forces occur because all molecules are polarizable.  The degree to which they are polarized depends on both the total number of electrons in the molecule and the volume of the molecule.  The greater the polarizability, the greater the London dispersion forces.

DRVSCxKpaa	Here is a long answer on the concept of the mole.  Avogadro's number basically follows from the fact that elements and compound react on a molecular basis, and the size of atoms and molecules varies:    The mole:  Chemical reactions take place on a molecular basis. A molecule of one substance reacts with a given number of molecules of another (eg 2 molecules of hydrogen react with one molecule of oxygen to produce 2 molecules of water; given by the formula 2H2 + O2  2H2O).    However, a molecule is very tiny, and it is inconvenient to consider reactions in terms of individual molecules. But we need to be able to calculate how much of a given substance will react with how much of another (eg; how many grams of hydrogen will react with a given weight of oxygen in the above reaction, and how much water would be produced.)    All elements are made of atoms composed of protons, neutrons and electrons. All protons neutrons and electrons are the same for every element (ie, there is no difference between the proton in an oxygen atom and that in a hydrogen atom). But each atom contains a different number of protons. Hydrogen atoms contain 1, oxygen atoms contain 8. The number of protons determines an element's position in the periodic Table (eg, Hydrogen is element 1, Oxygen is element 8).    As well as protons; the atoms also contain neutrons in their nucleus. Usually the number of neutrons is the same as the number of protons; but not always - especially for the heavier elements; which may have slightly more or slightly less neutrons than protons. Neutrons weigh nearly the same as protons, so if we want to compare the weights of atoms; we only need to count the number of protons and neutrons (the electrons make only a tiny difference).     Giving the proton a nominal value of one, the 'atomic mass' can then be calculated. For hydrogen, the 'atomic mass' is 1 (one proton only, no neutrons); for oxygen it is 16 (8 protons and 8 neutrons) For some elements, the figure is not a whole number, because the number of neutrons might vary (Magnesium for instance is element 12, but but some of the atoms have 13 neutrons, so on average there are slightly more neutrons than 12, so its atomic mass is 24.31)    Now using these atomic masses, we can calculate the masses of materials in a chemical reaction. For instance, we know Hydrogen is element 1, so an H2 molecule will have mass 2, and in the above reaction, 2 molecules of Hydrogen will have mass 4. These will react with 1 molecule of O2, having mass 32 (two atoms each of atomic mass 16).    By convention, the average atomic mass is converted to grams. This is called a 'gram atom', or 'Mole'. Thus one mole of oxygen (O2) will contain 32 grams of oxygen.    As another answerer noted, there are a very large number of molecules in a mole (6.023X10^23), so it is a lot easier to calculate chemical reactions using moles.    Therefore, in our reaction between Hydrogen and Oxygen, we know that 4 grams of Hydrogen will combine with 32 grams of Oxygen to produce 36 grams of water.    Remember that for some elements, the weight of a mole is not an even number (as for Magnesium). For any molecule, the weight of a mole can be calculated by adding up all the atomic masses, and converting to grams. Eg, for Fe2O3, the answer is 55.85*2 + 16*3 = 159.7 Therefore, a mole of Iron (ferrous) oxide will weigh 159.7 grams.|`|f8Yw96G2aa	read it in your textbook man|`|PlxknZV4aa	Because it's defined as exactly 12 grams of Carbon-12.

Magnification is how close the optics can take you to a subject, in microscopes this would be in something like 10X or 100X and in photography this would be in a focal length such as 300mm.    I know its easy to get confused but see if this helps you to understand:  You could get an image of a certain part of an object by using a very high magnification and a low resolution, in this case the optics would provide the imaging sensor with an image of a small area of the image - the part you are interested in.  You could also use a low magnification and a high resolution, this gives you a very large image but you can zoom into whatever parts your interested in and the detail is still fairly good.  For the best results however you'd use an appropriate magnification so you see what you need then use the highest resolution possible.

AA10674874	Suppose you flip a fair coin 10 times, and see 4 heads and 6 tails.     You know that the true probability of getting heads is 50%    However, if you were to estimate the probability of getting heads, you would estimate it as 40% (since you only got a heads 4 times out of 10).    This is the difference -- a parameter is the "truth," and a statistic is based off of data you observe. You attempt to estimate the parameter with the statistic.    For another example, suppose you want to know the average height of all the men in the U.S, so you randomly choose 20 guys and measure their heights.    There is a true mean height of all males in the U.S. You don't know exactly what it is, but it's what you would get if you could measure every single male in the U.S. (all ~130 million) and average their heights. This is the parameter.    Now, the average height of the 20 guys you measured is the statistic. You didn't see all ~130 million men, you just saw these 20. You're using the mean height of these 20 men as a statistic to estimate the parameter, the mean height of all men in the U.S.

If the perimeter is the "green" edge, then you can consider panes touching two edges to be the corners of this 2-D square. Thus 4 panes touch the frame.    If each edge is 12 panes, then there are 44 panes around the outside of the square. Four of these are corners and touch 2 sides to green. Therefore there are 40 panes that touch the green frame with one side. (Draw a picture and count to be 100% certain).    Since you have 44 panes around the outside touching the frame, and 144 panes total, that means the inside square of 10x10 panes touch not the green frame. 100 Panes have no sides touching the green frame.

WPPIaLORaa	The axial skeletons of all vertebrates are very similar in structure in terms of the shapes of the vertebrae (not number) and their articulations to the skull, ribs and pelvis.  Furthermore, their embryological development is nearly identical for the first ten to twenty percent of their embryonic development.  After that, they diverge toward their adult forms.    The bottom line is that the vertebral column is and has always been a feature of a long history of vertebrates for the past 500 million years.   Form an evolutionary point of view, the last common ancestor of all of the vertebrates had a spinal column, even before vertebrates  evolved jaws.

Gnfc4wRlaa	The earth's tectonic plates are in motion, moving like giant 'rafts' on top of the semi-molten mantle below. However this movement is slow and rates vary from less than 2.5cm /yr to over 15cm/yr.    The movement of the earth's crustal plates is believed to be due to convection currents which occur in the semi-molten mantle. These convection currents are created by heat from within the earth - much of which is generated by radioactive decay in the core.
NIb8zWEHaa	Genetic driftalong with natural selection, mutation, and migrationis one of the basic mechanisms of evolution.    a change in the gene pool of a small population that takes place strictly by chance. Genetic drift can result in genetic traits being lost from a population or becoming widespread in a population without respect to the survival or reproductive value of the alleles involved. A random statistical effect, genetic drift can occur only in small, isolated populations in which the gene pool is small enough that chance events can change its makeup substantially. In larger populations, any specific allele is carried by so many individuals that it is almost certain to be transmitted by some of them unless it is biologically unfavourable.    The frequency of alleles with the same fitness may change at random through time in a process called genetic drift.    If there are two alleles at a locus, and they have the same fitness, random sampling can cause their relative frequencies in a population to change. Genetic drift has important consequences for the random substitution of genes and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.    The rate of change of gene frequency by random drift depends on the size of the population. Random sampling effects are more important in smaller populations. Imagine flipping 10 sets of 20, or 4000, coins. On average, there would be 50% heads in both cases, but the chance of flipping 12 heads and eight tails in the small population is higher than the chance of flipping 2400 heads and 1600 tails in the large. If a population is small, it is more likely that a sample will be biased away from the average by any given percentage amount; genetic drift is therefore greater in smaller populations. The smaller the population, the more important are the effects of random sampling; this was shown in Dobzhansky's experiments with fruitflies (results opposite).|`|CYtMRC4eaa	It allows random changes in alleles that increase the amount of variability in a population.

The volume of a sphere is (4/3)(pi)(r^3)  The volume of a right circular cylinder is (1/2)(pi)(r^2)L, where L is the length of the cylinder.    Total volume = Volume of the sphere + volume of the cylinder    100 = (4/3)(pi)(r^3) + (1/2)(pi)(r^2)L    Rearrange to get the L by itself:    L = [100 - (4/3)(pi)(r^3)] / [(1/2)(pi)(r^2)]
Hw5xFK0qaa	There are infinitely many parabolas passing through (3, 0) and (1, -16).    The easiest way to find one specific parabola is to select a specific case where the equation is easily found.    EXAMPLE ONE: ? Case where (1, -16) is the vertex...    (x - 1)2 = 4a(y - -16)    Using (3, 0) to find a: ? (3 - 1)2 = 4a(0 + 16)  ???????? 4 = 4a * 16  ???????? a = 1 / 16    (x - 1)2 = (y + 16) / 4  y = 4(x - 1)2 - 16  y = 4x2 - 8x + 4 - 16  y = 4x2 - 8x - 12    EXAMPLE TWO: ? Case where the function is SYMMETRIC, with roots at (3, 0)...    y = A(x - 3)(x + 3) = A(x2 - 9)    Using (1, -16) to find A: ? -16 = A[(-1)2 - 9]  ???????? -16 = A(1 - 9)  ???????? A = -16 / -8 = 2    y = 2(x2 - 9)  y = 2x2 - 18    GENERAL CASE... ? let y = Ax2 + Bx + C    Using (3, 0): ? 0 = A(3)2 + 3B + C  ???????? 0 = 9A + 3B + C  ???????? C = -9A - 3B .......... (1)    Using (1, -16) and (1): ? -16 = A(1)2 + B(1) + -9A - 3B  ???????? -16 = A + B + - 9A - 3B  ???????? -16 = -8A + -2B  ???????? 2B = 16 - 8A  ???????? B = 8 - 4A ........ (2)    Using (2) in (1): ? C = -9A - 3(8 - 4A)  ???????? C = -9A - 24 + 12A  ???????? C = 3A - 24    So, the general case is y = Ax2 + (8 - 4A)x + (3A - 24), for any real A  0    My example (1) above is the A = 4 case: ? y = 4x2 - 8x - 12  My example (2) above is the A = 2 case: ? y = 2x2 - 18  The answer provided by kbmnyeuij is the A = 1 case: ? y = x2 + 4x - 21|`|WeGoHFdzaa	since only 2 points are given  use y=x^2+bx+c  sub and solve  y=x^2+4x-21

When that piston is pushing down it has maximum push from the gases at top dead center and the pressure rapidly drops as it closes toward the bottom of the cylinder.     But just like pushing on the end of a wrench you develop maximum torque when your force is at a maximum pushing down and the direction of your push is perpendicular to the lever arm of the wrench.    So when the gases are pushing the piston down they are at maximum at top dead center, but the crankshaft is pointing straight up toward the top dead center also. Only when it passes top dead center does torque increase and reach a maximum when the crankshaft is well past top dead center and the crankshaft arm is gaining leverage by moving past top dead center along with the piston having near maximum force.    Power is a whole different concept and only tells you how much work a motor is capable of turning out over time. You could have a motor with tremendous torque by having a long crankshaft and high compression ratio, but still have low power because of the limited RPM's.    Like in motorcycle engines, if you keep the same crankshaft length (this determines the stroke of the engine and the longer the stroke the more torque you can develop) and first run it at 5000 RPM you will generate say 50 lbs of torque and 75 horsepower.     But if you take the exact same motor and run it at 10,000 RPM you will still get 50 lbs of torque because your crankshaft arm is still the same length ans the pressure from the cylinder gas explosions is still the same. But you will DOUBLE the horsepower.  Horsepower is simply the rate of producing work in a certain time, so horsepower is measured over a time period and the average work produced is measured.    Torque on the other hand is a INSTANTANEOUS force and has nothing to do with a time period. It's like this if you could curl 100 lbs on your arms with a  1ft long forearm, you generated 100 ft lbs of torque (and lifted it one foot). If you lifted it 10 times in a minute then you lifted 1000 lbs one foot in one minute or 100 lbs 10 feet in one minute (same power) .     But say you lifted it 50 times in one minute. You still only generated 100 ft lbs of torque but your maximum power has increased by 500%     So to sum it up, MEP is greater at maximum torque because it is measuring an instantaneous maximum torque caused by  the maximum pressure from the gases pushing the piston down.    Maximum power is maximum power, which by definition, is a period of time, usually longer than instantaneous, which lowers the peak somewhat by averaging the power curve for some preset time|`|nTKuRFlKaa	*As piston engines always have their maximum torque at a lower rotating speed than the maximum output, the BMEP is lower at full power, it's because the efficiency is lowered by more friction losses, air viscosity, below optimum combustion, etc.     P / (2f ) = T        MEP = P / (fV) for a two-stroke,      MEP = 2P / (fV) for a four-stroke    where,        P is power (in Watts)      V is volume (in cubic meters)      f is rotating speed (in Hertz)     (Torque) x (2  Revolutions per Cycle)   = (Mean Effective Pressure) x (Swept Volume per Operating Cycle)    Mean Effective Pressure   = 2  (Torque) x (Revolutions per Cycle) / Displacement

QJh3Rzc4aa	http://www.hostsrv.com/webmab/app1/MSP/q...|`|uT4vDq22aa	Well, I'll post some tips first. First try to see if there is a common factor among all of the terms. This makes factoring much easier. Then after, try to see if there's a special case of factoring that is present in the question. Other than that, getting better at factor is accompanied with practice. The more questions you do, the more likely you'll be able to see what you should do.    I'm assuming you don't want someone telling you the anwsers, so I'll just tell you what each case is. If you don't care to see it, or want to do it on your own, don't look below.    1. difference of cubes  2. sum of cubes  3. common factor followed by a difference of cubes  4. common factor followed by a difference of squares  5. common factor followed by a difference of cubes  6. factoring similar to ax^2 + bx + c except x^2 is x^6 and x is x^3  7. common factor then similar to what was stated in 6. but with x^8 and x^4.    The link below is helpful with special cases of factoring (in case you didn't learn them yet).
DU8zxsKRaa	Perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes (or the product of the slopes always equals -1)    So if the slope of one is 2, the other must be -1/2.    So we find the slope of the given line, then find it's opposite reciprocal.  We do that by putting it into slope-intercept form:    8x + 7y = 3  7y = -8x + 3  y = (-8/7)x + (3/7)    The slope is -8/7    So the slope of the perpendicular line must be 7/8 (the opposite reciprocal).    Now that we know the slope, and a point on the line (an x and a y), we can find the y-intercept by solving for b:    y = mx + b  -5 = (7/8)(8) + b  -5 = 7 + b  -12 = b    So the equation of the seciong line in slope-intercept form is:    y = (7/8)x - 12|`|5Pf2az2saa	P(8,-5)  and 8x+7y=3    you first find the slope of the first equation by solving for y (rearranging the eq.)   so, 7y= -8x+3  y= (-8/7)x+3/7    therefore, you found that the slope, m=- 8/7  this means that the slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprical of the orgiinal, So, m2= 7/8    So you have m2, and a Point    now use the form     (y2-y1)=m2(x2-x1)    Plug in  8 for y1 and -5 for x1, and for m2= 7/8, and solve    (y-(-5)= 7/8 (x-8), multiply both sides by 8, eliminating the 8 in 7/8    8(y+5)= 7(x-8), expand  8y+40= 7x-56  8y= 7x - 56 -40  8y= 7x - 96  y= 7/8x- 12    Thats the answer:D|`|Q0jUU7A5aa	Remember that the slope-intercept form of a line equation is:  y = mx + b  m = slope  b = y-intercept    Given: 8x + 7y = 3    Rewrite this in y = mx + b.  8x + 7y = 3  7y = -8x + 3  7y / 7 = (-8x + 3) / 7  y = (-8 / 7)x + (3 / 7)    This means:  m_given = (-8 / 7)  b_given = (3 / 7)    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Remember that parallel lines have the same slope.  m_parallel = m_given    Plug in what you found out earlier.  m_parallel = (-8 / 7)    Plug this into the general slope-intercept form.  y = mx + b  y = (-8 / 7)x + b    Given: point (8, -5)  Means: x = 8, y = -5    Plug these values into what you have and solve for b.  y = (-8 / 7)x + b  -5 = (-8 / 7)(8) + b  -5 = (-64 / 7) + b  -5 + (64 / 7) = b  -5(7 / 7) + (64 / 7) = b  (-35 / 7) + (64 / 7) = b  (-35 + 64) / 7 = b  (29 / 7) = b    Update your equation.  y = (-8 / 7)x + b  y = (-8 / 7)x + (29 / 7)    ANSWER: y = (-8 / 7)x + (29 / 7)     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Remember that perpendicular lines have slopes that are the negative inverse of each other.  m_perpendicular = -1 / m_given    Plug in what you found out earlier.  m_perpendicular = -1 / (-8 / 7) = -1 * (7 / -8) = (7 / 8)    Plug this into the general slope-intercept form.  y = mx + b  y = (7 / 8)x + b    Given: point (8, -5)  Means: x = 8, y = -5    Plug these values into what you have and solve for b.  y = (7 / 8)x + b  -5 = (7 / 8)(8) + b  -5 = 7 + b  -5 - 7 = b  -12 = b    Update your equation.  y = (7 / 8)x + b  y = (7 / 8)x + -12  y = (7 / 8)x - 12    ANSWER: y = (7 / 8)x - 12 |`|m31vJe5xaa	Well first you have to use that to find the equation of the first line.  8x+7y=3  subtract 8x from each side to get: 7y=-8x+3  Divide each side by 7 to get: y=-8/7x+3/7 and there is your first equation with the slope -8/7.    A parallel line has the same slope but travels through different points. If a point is (8,-5) you can use Point-Slope Form to find the equation for this new line.  y1-y=m(x1-x)  -5-y=-8/7(8-x)    -5-y=-7+8/7x    Add 5 to both sides    -y=8/7x+2    Multiply by -1 to make the Y positive    y=-8/7x-2    and there is your new equation in Slope-Intercept Form :)    I would double check this if I were you though lol

If that is all that there is then I'm pretty sure there is not going to be a  named syndrome.  For a more extreme example look up Mobius syndrome.    I guess absence of the relevant muscles is also possible though if there is no innervation they won't really develop so it will likely be a chicken/egg scenario.    Absence of tendons a lot less likely I would say...but no one here will be able to characterize it if its truly an idiosyncratic familial issue.

Drowning is usually a secondary effect much like people dying of pneumonia when gravely ill.    Healthy marine mammals, however, don't struggle to reach the surface to breathe. They evolved positive or neutral buoyancy and live effortlessly near the sea surface, even while sleeping. Yet, they are air-breathing animals and, when their health fails, "are prone to drowning," agrees Dave Rugh, wildlife biologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle.    Seals, sea lions, and fur seals frequently come ashore when they are sick, where they can rest, recover, and save themselves.     This strategy, on the other hand, misfires for whales. Often, says Mate, we find sick whales ashore, who may have beached themselves to avoid drowning. Before they can recover, though, gravity pools their blood or they overheat enough to cause irreversible tissue damage. They die soon-even if people push them back into the water.    As far as holding their breath forever, this does happen but only extremely rarely. "The behavior," says NOAA marine biologist Richard Merrick, "is so powerful that if triggered out of the water by handling or stress, individuals can stop breathing and asphyxiate (though surrounded by air)."|`|AA10481903	Whales are mammals - they must breathe air.

A characteristic of this spacetime geometry is that a circle of a given perimeter have GREATER diameter than what would be expected on a flat surface. So, as a thought exercise, imagine that you are walking in a broad valley, approaching what seems to be a village.  Before you reach the village, you first circumnavigate the village, coming back to where you were.  It may seem like less than a mile to you.  But as you then approach the village, it seems a lot further than a mile to you--either you'll think that you must be shrinking as you approach the center, or the village is getting bigger on you.  But assuming that there is no singularity, and you continue past the center of the village, you'll come out on the other side, having walked miles just to cross the circular area that only has a perimeter of less than a mile.  It takes some effort to keep up with such thought exercises, but it's possible to "visualize" it after a while.  There are mathematicians who have trained themselves to "visualize" 4D space.

KWqZe31Haa	Meiosis  Meiosis is a type of cell division used to produce gametes (egg or sperm cells) for sexual reproduction     1. A normal somatic cell (body cell; not a sex cell) has paired chromosomes, 2 chromosomes of similar size and shape called homologous pairs of chromosomes; one comes from each parent.    2. Different organisms have different normal chromosome numbers.     Humans have 46 chromosomes (= 23 homologous pairs).    3. Homologous chromosomes contain paired genes (sections of DNA) that have codes that influence the same trait, e.g. hair texture, eye color, blood type, etc.  But the homologous pairs do not necessarily share the exact same DNA coding for any trait.  Each homologous chromosome is inherited from a different parent therefore the genetic codes of the two chromosomes are not identical.    Gene - section of DNA code that controls a genetic trait.  Note: We will stress later that genes are codes for building proteins.  The proteins produced may be enzymes, structural proteins, or other proteins that somehow influence traits of an individual.     Gene locus (plural - loci)  the physical position where a certain gene is located on a certain chromosome    Allele - alternate forms of a gene, i.e., slightly different DNA codes that influence the form of a trait in the individual.  Each diploid individual has two alleles for a trait, one on each homologous chromosome, one from each parent.    Genotype - describes a gene pair of an individual, i.e., combination of 2 alleles it has for a trait    Phenotype - describes a physical trait that results from the genotype, i.e., curly hair vs. straight hair, or brown vs. blue eye color, or Type A vs. Type B blood type    4.  Chromosome duplication - During interphase, each chromosome makes an exact duplicate of itself, giving 2 sister chromatids attached as an X-shaped chromosome.    Homologous chromosomes - are 2 chromosomes inherited from different parents; they are the same size, shape, and have paired genes, but their DNA codes are not identical.    Sister chromatids - are the 2 halves of an X-shaped or duplicated chromosome; they are identical copies of DNA.    5. Meiosis creates daughter cells (gametes) with only one of each homologous pair.      meiosis   Diploid  (2N) ------------------------------------->  Haploid (1N)         homologous pairs of     only one of each homologous pair   chromosomes          germ cell (certain diploid cells    gamete  =    in gonads)        egg cell or sperm cell           6. SEX!    Any organism created by sexual reproduction inherits one set of chromosomes from mom (in the egg) and another set from dad (in the sperm) and therefore ends up with paired chromosomes (= diploid).  The offspring produced by sex are each a new and unique genetic combination.   Purpose of sexual reproduction is to rearrange DNA into new combinations to produce offspring that are not clones of the parents or of each other. This is termed genetic recombination.       7. The alternation of meiosis and fertilization keeps the chromosome number constant from generation to generation, while allowing genetic diversity of offspring.          Meiosis - reduces diploid germ cells to haploid gametes.       Fertilization  - fuses together two haploid gametes (egg + sperm) to make diploid zygote.      8. Meiosis involves 2 cell divisions     a. Meiosis I - each daughter cell gets 1 homologous chromosome of each pair.    (Sister chromatids do not separate.)  2 daughter cells result.     b. Meiosis II - Centromere divides and sister chromatids do separate. Each daughter     cell gets 1 sister chromatid .  Results in 4 haploid daughter cells.       10. Genetic Recombination  and Sources of Genetic Variation in Sexual Reproduction     Parts a, b, and c below explain why the processes of meiosis and fertilization result  in a tremendous genetic diversity in sexually-reproducing organisms. Genetic  recombination refers to the production of offspring that combine the genetic traits of two  parents.       a. Random alignment of chromosomes during Metaphase I - Note that as homologous pairs line up during Metaphase I, the random arrangement of the pairs on the left or the right each time meiosis occurs will determine which combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes ends up in which daughter cell.  This means that resulting gametes made will be genetically different every time a germ cell in an individual goes through meiosis to produce gametes.  In human cells the possible variation of gametes from one individual is tremendous. Each human can make over 8 million, or 8,000,000, genetically different gametes.      b. In humans, due to random fertilization of any possible egg by any possible sperm, the same two parents could thus produce about 70 trillion, or 70,000,000,000,000, genetically unique children.  This is far more people than the number of humans who have every lived; in fact, it is more than 10,000X the size of the current human populatio

Add this to the original amount to get the increased amount.    Answer:  330,000    P.S.  If it was a 10% decrease, you'd simply subtract $30,000 to get $270,000.  The other way to do this is to multiply the amount by 1 + r.    For a 10% increase --> multiply by 1 + 0.10 = 1.10  For a 10% decrease --> multiply by 1 - 0.10 = 0.90|`|F8X1WKOJaa	how do you fing the percentage?  for example 300,000 increased by 10%    10% means 10 out of 100.

MNS7Nc5waa	Beta particles are high-energy, high-speed electrons or positrons emitted by certain types of radioactive nuclei such as potassium-40.    Beta particles are able to penetrate living matter to a certain extent (radiation intensity from a small source of radioactive material decreases as one over the distance squared) and can change the structure of struck molecules. In most cases such change can be considered as damage with results possibly as severe as cancer and death. If the struck molecule is DNA it can show a spontaneous mutation. If this mutated DNA is in gametes the mutation may be passed to new generations. Almost all mutations are considered genetic defects.

Where x (of n) = 100+ x (of n minus 1). For example if it is the second number in the sequence (150) then you take the first number (100) divide it by 2 (50) and add 100 (150). For the fourth number (187.5) you take the third number (175) divide by 2 (87.5) and add 100 (187.5).|`|Ee4y7OJzaa	A= P+ (50/B)      where 100 is the 0 term    A is the answer to the next number in the sequence    P is answer to previous number in sequence    B is what term in the sequence|`|F8X1WKOJaa	What equation would the following pattern,100, 150, 175, 187.50, 193.75, exhibit ?    The equation is :   Tn = 200[1 - (1 / 2)^n].  ....................   answer  T4 = 187.5, here n = 4  therefor, T4 = 200[1 - (1/2)^4] = 200[1 - 1/16] = 200(15 / 16) = 187.5.  So the other terms.|`|8dffbce3266bc6eb44bbe27559482b26aa	If we subtract 100 from all terms, we have   0,50,25,12.5,6.25 as successive increases for the terms.  If we identify the first term with an index of j=0, then we can identify the increase of successive terms as  [50/ 2^(j-1)]  j=1 to 4.  Put this together, we have Yj = Yj-1 + 50 (1/ 2^(j-1) ) , j= 1,2,3,4 and Y0=100.

wBbasieQaa	To find the determinant of a 33 matrix, you multiply along the diagonals and add in one direction, subtract in the other.    Add this way:  \ \ \  \ \ \  \ \ \    Subtract this way:  / / /  / / /  / / /    The fist matrix's determinant is (2)(3)(1) + (4)(2)(-5) + (-1)(0)(7) - (2)(2)(7) - (4)(0)(1) - (-1)(3)(-5). That simplifies to 6 - 40 + 0 - 28 - 0 - 15 = -77.    The second matrix is (3)(2)(-1) + (1)(5)(-6) + (-2)(4)(3) - (3)(5)(3) - (1)(4)(-1) - (-2)(2)(-6).    The third is (-5)(7)(-1) + (4)(0)(-3) + (1)(4)(4) - (-5)(0)(4) - (4)(4)(-1) - (1)(7)(-3).
