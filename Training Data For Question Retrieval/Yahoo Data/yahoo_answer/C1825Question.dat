Hello   I am kind of new to UBUNTU, and there are certain things I just don't know how to do.   I have the same issue. Network disconnected after suspend. Reboot seems to be my only cure for it.      While researching this, I was led to the following:      To work around this issue, users can create a file /etc/pm/config.d/madwifi      containing the single line:      SUSPEND_MODULES=ath_pci      I don't want to sound ignorant, but how do I create that file? Do I just type "/etc/pm/config.d/madwifi" into a terminal, followed by "SUSPEND_MODULES=ath_pci"      I have been a WINDOWS user up to now, and so far I'm enjoying the switch to UBUNTU.      Thanks for any help you can provide me with.      Lloyd

There are tons of cards with the same GPU on newegg and the specifications section does not really help me since i lack some basic knowledge.       Core clock - Higher is better?       Stream processors - I assume higher is better?       Memory Size - important or are the speeds more important?       Memory Clock - Higher is better? Some say "(effective)" is that important and if so how do i compare that number to numbers not labeled effective?       For arguments sake If you were only able to choose a card by one or two of the specifications mentioned above which would it/they be?      Thanks so much

I have sony vaio laptop, initially there were several sony's applications installed such as vaio zone, vaio media click dvd etc. I uninstalled all these cause i found it consumes too much memory. But recently i thought to install vaio zone. but its not installing, there is vaio recovery tool programme where one can choose which programme to install, i choose vaio zone installler 1......but when i try to install it rollback and say failed to install ms sql server engine. But i installed vaio zone installed 2 , when i run vaio zone it shows message says, vaio entertainment platform is not installed in this machine. So i think it refers ms sql server engine, which didnt install properly, i tried several times but no luck. Do u guys have any idea for this?

20090125101805AAFvwJz	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Extraire son d'un jeu vidéo en ISO?	Je voudrais extraire la musique d'un jeu vidéo que j'ai au format ISO. Comment faire? Pour info, je ne veux pas graver le jeu car je n'ai pas de lecteur de jeux vidéos.      @F4RH3LL et Henri VIII: si vous ne savez pas, ne répondez pas s'il vous plait. Surtout pour répondre des aneries.      Il y a 6 minutes   @ψΘlfε?I?...: oui, en faisant une recherche avec Google, j'ai trouvé la piste éventuelle d'n lecteur virtuel.   Sinon, pour les 2 personnes qui ont répondu avant toi, je persiste à dire que ce sont des abrutis. Non seulement ils ne répondent pas mais en plus ils me prennent pour un con en me proposant de trouver la musique sur youtube ou en CD. Franchement, si je pose la question, c'est qu'il y a une partie de la bande son qui n'est pas dans le commerce et ne le sera jamais. Leur réponse m'a fait perdre du temps. Ce sont eux les malpolis. Quand je n'ai pas de réponse, je me tais, c'est une des bases sur savoir vivre.      Sinon, je ne vois pas comment être plus précis: "extraire le son d'un jeu vidéo au format ISO". Quel intérêt de savoir que c'est "skate 2"? Je sais qu'un fichier ISO est un format compressé et j'ai bien précisé que c'est d'un jeu vidéo. Ma question est très limpide.

I am starting a new home-based job on Thursday and it is a job requirement for me to have a minimum of 1.5 mbps for my download speed.  I tested mine and it is nowhere near it, it is currently at around 250-300 kpbs. One other thing, I am currently using wireless, not a router.  I think I have a router, but I am not sure it is feasible to use it.  What is the quickest and most practical way to meet this job requirement.  Also, will I have to use the router no matter what to increase this speed?      William

20090220165725AAjsM2V	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	If you upload a video to youtube, do they own it? What are the copyrights?	I have a couple videos that I have made just for fun, as jokes for my friends and just to entertain myself. I would like to share them with people online to get feedback about my editing, etc. (The nice thing about sharing stuff online is there is a certain degree of anonymity that masks the potential embarrasment factor of a crappy video.) However, I'm hesitant to put a video up on youtube, as I'm afraid that Youtube will own it if I do. What are the property rights for videos that are uploaded on Youtube?      Also - if I were to get a Youtube account, which username do you like better: TullyTheRobot, ManicPie, or ManicMeat?
