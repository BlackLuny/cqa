Stop it now though|`|pvgwJwxvaa	find a good high quality diet and stick with it.  put the food down, leave it for 15 minutes, if she doesnt eat right away, pick it up and then offer it at the next feeding time.  do not leave it down all the time, do not offer people food, do not offer canned food.  if she begs while you are eating or cooking, put her in a crate.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Maybe it is not a quality food. I would get Solid Gold Barking at the moon. They have it at Petco.My dogs will eat this and love it. They also are fed a special diet that I fix for them that is a "people food" with the supplements they need. There are people who feed Raw and BARF feeding both of which use raw meat. I don't think any dog would turn that down. Try soaking the kibble with warm water or chicken broth. That may make her like it better.|`|aGJmiOMMaa	First of all - take your dog to the vet. She may not be well. Also not surprising that after giving her table scraps and wet dog food that she's snubbing the kibble.

0jlnYGsNaa	To become an equine vet you need to have really good grades and a really good grade point average. One thing is that you might want to go and job shadow a vet. So then you could see if you really want to do it. You would also want to see what college that you want to go to do all this in. When you figure that out see what they want you to have to be able to go to their school. experience|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Before you can apply at vet school you need to get your bachelor's degree in a related science field, such as biology. Before you can do that you need to have excellent high school grades and references. In college you should have at least a 3.7 and before you graduate accumulated hundreds of hours worth of work study in the vet field to even be taken into consideration but a vet school. Good luck!

23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	Sometime I blow towards my horses nose.. I've seen her do it to other horses and sometimes she approaches me blowing out like she does other horses so I just do it back... I have no idea what I'm achieving but she seems to respond so i keep doing it! Not sure if I'd ever do it with another horse.<br>  When he moves his lips over you its sounds as though he is "grooming" you. If you see other horses in the paddock with each other they often groom each other by doing this. It just means he trusts you and wants to reciprocate the attention you are giving him.<br>  <br>  I once heard that horses don't "like" or "love" us the way we love them... but I think thats a load of bollocks!|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Would you go up to a dog and blow in their face if you "sorta" knew them? Nope! You're just asking for trouble. I think a nice pat on the shoulder would be just fine in this circumstance. You can also watch a horse's ears to gauge their moods... Pricked forward indicates attentiveness/interest, pinned back indicates anger/aggression/fear, middle of the road indicates calmness/nonchalance.|`|3wIZiZA5aa	I did this but I let my horses come to me and sniff and blow on my face first. Then I GENTLY, ever so gently, blow on his nose, and he blows back on my face. It's what horses do in herd to get to know each other. Let the horse come up to you first and let him blow on your face. If he tries to bite you, I would make him back up, apparently he doesn't like you much if he's trying to bite. Just be cool, calm and collected when your with him, and don't annoy him by blowing on his face first. <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|hEXb1unraa	Agree with mule...good way to get bit in the face....Ive seen it happen....just think about what happens when you blow in your dogs face or someones elses face.....its just irritating.....some horses will be nice and ignore it because they are trained well, but come on....its a ridiculous thing to do to any living creature....|`|ULpjTKYDaa	i have done this with my horse before and he competly responds back but are u blowing hard on him ?blow through your nose in stead SOFTLY! lol<br>  good luck|`|XJ9oSR2daa	I never blow in my guys noses, it torks them off...|`|Rc6HBfBzaa	Well in the wild they blow up each others noses i think that it is to smell their sent so,  mabye the horse is not friendly because i go riding every week and the wee foal that i help look after loves getting its nose "like" tickled!<br>  <br>  <br>  Where as the 15.00hh horse that i ride doesn't like getting its face touched!<br>  If he trys to bite then point your finger at him and say no but just watch that his owner doesn't see you but you can let them get away with it!and you might be anoying him though so maybe stop it!<br>  <br>  Ohh and if he runs his lips up and down then he is whats called grooming you, if a horse grooms you then that means that he likes what you are doing!<br>  <br>  And i think that he prob does like you!|`|EaNjIhoQaa	I've done this with all my 7 horses and some love it and others hate it.<br>  I have a large Tennessee Walker that is very sensitive and she'll blow back to me when I gently blow in her nose. She really likes it. Then I have another horse who twitches her lips when I blow in her nose. She thinks it's annoying.<br>  When horses are first introducing themselves they put their noses up to each other and blow. That's kind of their way of shaking hands.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the horse is annoyed so a simple way to remedy that would be....don't do it anymore. Some horses just hate it. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Don't do it.  Sounds like you are already seeing the end result (he may eventually bite you) in the face.<br>  <br>  Its not that he doesn't like you, but he is telling you that he sure doesn't like you blowing in his nose.  So listen to what he is telling you.<br>  <br>  I would say stop doing it before he bites, it is promoting bad habits to form. its not boredom.  We pet all of our horses on there foreheads not on the nose, this prevents any bad habits like nipping or biteing from forming.  <br>  <br>  I agree with the two top responses <br>  <br>  Jenny|`|2f8vsYQFaa	well a lot of horses like someone blowing very softly around their nostrils however neither of my horses ever made much of a reaction when I tried this, to make them like you regularly feed them a carrot/apple/other treat and give them loads of hugs and pats. he is not trying to bite you he's probably just rubbing his face against you  to show affection and if you dont like it then just push him away and give him a at to show him he's not done anything wrong x|`|6crNAaUgaa	I have been around horses all my life & I have noticed that some horses like being touched or messed with on their nose's & others just find it really irritating!!! I would stop if I was you, unless you want bit!!! & no this does not mean the horse doesn't like you it just means he doesn't like what your doing 2 him/her!! Good Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kay-- =]|`|fpBUrBWaaa	First spend some time with the horse. if he/she trusts you then you can try to blow in its nose. maybe if he/she trusts you then it wont try to bite or nip you. hopefully you can use this information.|`|0jlnYGsNaa	Why not stop doing that. you can totally tell the horse does not like it. so stop. he's going to bite you sooner or later!|`|unVj43Xxaa	That's myth but at the same time horses do get acquainted by touching noses. You should avoid putting your face in a horses muzzle that you do not know well or if you lack knowledge with reading horses body language. Especially if this horse happens to be a stallion. I could be seen to a stud as a aggressive challenge. Horses are not really like dogs in terms of the are one owner animals. The horse you feed and care for years can easily become just as content with the another person who takes over the feed and care. It's doubtful he's showing aggression to you if he's just playing with your jumper. I would avoid putting myself in a situation that he can continue to do it cause he could accidentally bit you. If you handle him always use a halter and lead rope so you can keep his head straight or out of your face while grooming or hanging out with him. That will detour that behavior. But firstly, I think it's important to have the owner's permission before handling or messing around with someone elses horse.|`|g36NU81raa	1. Don't do that, it's annoying to the horse.<br>  2. If he is nibbling your jumper, he's probably looking for something to eat or he can smell something on you.<br>  <br>  Both of these things can lead to biting.|`|UeCIiv3Zaa	i dont think i would like it if someone kept blowing in my face either. so just pet him and play with him the more time you spend with him the more he will like you
YUQgyPT3aa	Not if it's only a few grains...<br>  <br>  Rice does absorb liquid and expand, so a belly-full could cause problems.<br>  <br>  just keep an eye out, sweep it up when you see in on the ground.|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	Yes, it could definitely hurt him. When you cook rice on the stove it is dry and when you add the liquid to it, it gets a lot bigger,  the dog could fill up on dry rice and explode (literally) from the rice expanding.  That is also why rice is not allowed to be thrown at weddings anymore because the birds would fill up on it and then explode and die.  DO NOT GIVE A DOG DRY RICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|pDv13gJwaa	No. <br>  <br>  <br>  to Sarah down below us .....oh my god, such drama, a few grains of rice will not hurt a dog. If the dog eats too much it will throw it up.. you people......LOL<br>  <br>  there has never been a dog blow up from eating rice... you're killing me here|`|paerqxfMaa	It shouldn't, but if they eat alot of it and then when it expands in their tummy - they could be a little under the weather.  A few grains won't hurt them.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	If he ate a lot, he might get a tummy ache, but if it was just a little, he'll be fine.|`|PoiQKGfgaa	it shouldn't just be sure they have water|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It can cuz the rice expands. Call vet to be certain & you really need to know the amount & put table away. A large amount will kill them as it expands in the stomach. Call vet now to be certain.
TdrgZwnoaa	My cat goes out in the Summer. She's not a big snow enthusiast but she will venture out on the porch in the Winter. <br>   In the Summer she visits the neighbour's place to hunt mice because the lady bribes her with food. My cat used up a whole 1 pound bag of food last Summer and never once used her litter dish. I have seen her consorting with the feral cats across the road and on occasion I see her up a tree chasing birds and squirrels. And I know that she plays 'tag' with the local coyotes because I have the vet bills to prove it. What she does with the rest of her time is a mystery to me but we do find lots of mouse heads on the front stoop.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	get in trouble , mostly.<br>  <br>  hunt, sleep, explore, beg for food.<br>  <br>  i had a cat that would leave for months, the whole summer. lived to be 20.|`|afec6d005fb7698534de7994ff84613caa	Who knows?  Its the cats personality that's the factor here.  I had a cat who used to go out, only to lay under a bush about 5 feet from the house, or go under the house.  Sometimes they hunt, our area was horrible with mice, and the cats in the area kept them to a minimum.    After being out all day, she'd come back in, eat her dinner and do whatever till morning.  She lived to be 14.|`|m2jeeo4Laa	I have three cats, and one just loves to go outside.  He first runs across the street and poops in the neighbor's yard.

wGOtDZ0Uaa	having seen the damage that a shock collar can do I would never use<br>  one, you may like to try a spray collar, they are much kinder and<br>  usually spray citronella.

My gsd will bark at planes also helicopters<br>  send all 3 of our dogs barmy,dont know why but they are all<br>  different.|`|AA10766729	Negative reinforcement is often the best means, especially when the behavior is deeply embedded, and the animal is committing the behavior when the owners are either not home or the animal is someplace where it is not easily reprimanded.<br>  <br>  The shock collar isn't horrible, and it will hopefully stop the bad behavior quickly.|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	spank his butt.|`|zrwqYItJaa	u could get him a muzzle???|`|nBehRANyaa	Yes. Bring him inside. Supervise him when he's in the back yard and call him away from the back fence if he starts barking. If you can't call him away from the fence, work on training him so that you can.  Exercise him more so he's not standing outside barking out of boredom.  Return the shock collar to the store.|`|xvTPUidNaa	The shock collar is NOT the answer. It can make a dog so afraid that it may not even want to leave the house. try to re focus the dog's attention with a sound. If the dog stops barking for 3 seconds, and looks at you. treat the dog. This will eventually make the dog see that a noise means stops barking|`|fpBUrBWaaa	i make my dogs stop barking by loudly saying "HUSH" If that doesn't work bring him inside and strongly say "NO BARK!"

AA10766729	Buy a rabbit ownership book -- available at any pet store, and READ IT.<br>  <br>  Also, make an appointment with a vet that treats exotics (birds, rabbits, reptiles, etc), and get a full physical for them now and then once a year thereafter.<br>  <br>  My vet recommended that we feed ours lots of GREENS (not carrots -- they're actually quite fattening!), so try them on loose-leaf lettuces -- NOT iceberg, kale, mustard greens, spinach, cilantro, parsley, etc.  And buy a bale of timothy grass (NOT alfalfa -- also not great for rabbits once they reach adulthood), and let them eat their fill.<br>  <br>  Greens are good for rabbits...it's what they eat in the wild.  Pellets are actually quite horrible...filled with empty calories (unless you get the type that are made from 100% timothy hay...very expensive!).|`|hQQuqyYcaa	First of all, you need a proper cage. You need rabbit pellets, alfalfa hay (at 6 months old, switch them to Timothy hay), water bottle, and a knowledgeable rabbit vet. Rabbits should get greens/veggies/small amounts of fruits each day, but not enough to be their entire diet. If they are  younger than 4 months old, feed them ONLY pellets and hay. Do not give them veggies at this young of age. Make sure they have a constant supply of hay. When they get to be about 4 months old, you can slowly start introducing veggies, and make sure you get them neutered/spayed.<br>  <br>  Please let me know if you have more questions about your bunnies.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Right okay then,<br>  <br>  Carrots are HIGH in sugar,thus,meaning are unsuitable for a main meal,only as a treat. Ice-Berg lettuce is harmful to rabbits,causing stomach upsets & Cucumber shouldn't just be fed. Rabbits survive PERFECTLY well in the cold,in fact they do not do well in the hot,when its cold do NOT shove them in a box,as long as they have nice soft bedding,such as Pine wood shavings,or Carefresh they are lovely & snug. Its NOT advised to leave rabbits in full,hot sunlight as they can so very easily be heatstroke,which indeed can be fatal.<br>  <br>  You need:<br>  <br>  Rabbit Mix,or Pellets pet shops sell this--STOP-- feeding carrots & Lettuce,just an occasional bit of cucumber,until they are older(after 12wks old). Hay should make up to --90%-- of a rabbits daily diet,Meadow or Timothy hay SHOULD be fed daily.<br>  <br>  The hutch should be AT LEAST 5ft x 2ft for a pair of DWARF rabbits.<br>  <br>  Toys,rabbits ARE intelligent creatures & easily get bored,provide some interesting toys for them such as Loo rolls,magazines(to rip up) cardboard boxes or rabbit shop brought toys.<br>  <br>  Have they got a rabbit water bottle? Bottles ARE better than bowls.<br>  <br>  What about litter training them? Rabbits can be litter trained like cats,you need a litter tray & some --NON-- clumping cat litter such as Wood or Paper based,do NOT use clay,as thy may digest this when grooming,causing intestinal blockages.<br>  <br>  A brush,such as a slicker brush this keeps their coat nice & clean & helps with blood circulation.<br>  <br>  You need a lot of help,rabbits are much more hard work than most people think.<br>  <br>  Good luck.xxx|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	Firstly they need a proper home hun. Why don't you get a large cage for your bedroom and keep them there. That way you can keep an eye on them and create a strong bond with them. Rabbits are lovely indoor pets :)<br>  Then you need to get some pellet foods. Vegetables are not enough for them to eat alone. They also need LOTS of fresh hay. Without hay a rabbits digestive system will go really bad and they can die.<br>  I have a website which easily explains how to care for your bunny. It tells you everything you need to know, such as their diet, how much exercise is needed, housing options, litter training, rabbits with other pets etc. etc.<br>  Good luck with caring for your bunnies.

Just email me if you need any more help.<br>  Raych|`|BO28Mn8haa	rabbit food, water. and read a book about them please before they are dead bunnies|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	It really makes me angry when people get pets and are too lazy to do a bit of research first about the basic care of animals.. I am guessing you are a teenager too, so in this your parents make me angry for not being responsible about this.. but for the sake of your rabbits I will answer your question:<br>  <br>  You need to have a cage/plastic hutch for indoor rabbits or a wooden hutch for outdoor rabbits NOT A BOX!!! in the cage/hutch they need bedding (wood shavings/ care fresh), a water bottle, food bowl. You should be feeding them rabbit food pellets to ensure they get all the nutrients they need, you also need to ensure that 70% of their food intake is timothy hay.. RABBITS NEED A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF HAY TO STOP THEM FROM DIEING FROM CONSTAPATION.<br>  <br>  You should only give them carrots as little treat every day not as their only food source. Lettuce/ cucumbers is not good for bunnies as the water content is too high and gives them dioreah which can kill your bunny.<br>  <br>  You can get covers for rabbit hutches for the winter to help kee them warm.<br>  <br>  You need to clean the hutch/cage out at least once a week, and clean out the corner they are using as a toilet every other day (more often if they young). <br>  <br>  Give them wooden toys to chew on this helps their teeth and also things like toilet rolls are good fun too.<br>  <br>  keep an eye on their claws as you will need to clip them every 6 weeks to avoid painful complications.<br>  <br>  Getting your bunny netered will help keep them healthy and will also help curb any behaivour issues.. you can do from about 6 months old.<br>  <br>  Also you MUST get your rabbit vacinated from VHD and Mixomotsis as these diseases are very common and deadly, you need to do this every 6 months.<br>  <br>  If your rabbit lives outside please make sure they are safe from foxes/ dogs etc etc. Foxes and dogs will rip the chicken wire off the front of the cage to get to your rabbit! <br>  <br>  It is generally better for your rabbit if they are kept as house rabbits (they can be litter trained).<br>  <br>  Now stop being lazy and google rabbit care because you can easily find all this out for yourself!|`|bf03f3398ae59403fb987824b585b742aa	You can get really nice rabbit food at most pet stores. Too much veg can give them an upset tummy.<br>  <br>  You should put them in a rabbit hutch when they aren't playing outside. They can chew through cardboard really quick. <br>  <br>  I always put sawdust at the bottom then straw on top and always make sure that they have hay to eat at all times. Rabbits teeth can grow very long and cause problems. They need to chew alot  to keep their teeth filed down. Hay and straw does this. They will eat newspaper(not very good for them)<br>  <br>  <br>  You can also litter train rabbits if you want them in the house. Just put some treats(spinach, carrots etc) in the litter tray(you can buy corner trays for rabbits) Just put sawdust in it. Every now and then pop the rabbits in the tray. They will get the hang of it.<br>  Make sure you dont have male and females coz you will have lots of baby bunnies before you know it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|pMk19kkaaa	lettece is bad for rabbits,<br>  so feed them sliced or grated carrots if they are used to eating them, ween them of them by mixing them in with normal rabbit food.<br>  also give them water. <br>  Rabbits do suffer from humonia also, <br>  so when the weather is cold keep them warm,<br>  by stocking the cage up with hay. and saw dust at the bottom of the cage.|`|ImuEs8Syaa	Don't feed them lettace. That causes loose stools, dehydration, and can kill the rabbits. <br>  You need a proper hutch. A decent hutch will be at least ￡40-￡50.

They need rabbit pellets.<br>  <br>  If you don't really know much about certain animals, I would suggest researching it before you get them.|`|hUDkPLCraa	STOP giving them lettuce.  It messes their digestive system up.  Rabbit food from a pet shop will be the best diet.  Get a book from the library, or ask at the vets for advise.

2Skznsq8aa	Build a "cat sanctuary" fenced in back yard where they can come in an out safely.  Chicken wire is cheap and will keep them in, but it won't work if you have kids or dogs bumping up against because theyw ill eventually break it down.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Teach your kids to shut the door behind themselves. Until they learn, the cats will be fine upstairs. A cat's body temperature is 5 degrees warmer than ours, so they like it warmer, anyway. Plus, they are down at floor level, and heat rises, so it won't feel as hot to them. Leave a fan on if you are concerned it will get too hot. Just provide a bowl of fresh water for them.|`|FTL1F0fGaa	well maybe setup a gate or something a long the lines of that so the kids can get in and out but the cats cant get out|`|yuBuNoPDaa	I would impress upon your children the importance of closing the door when they go outside and if they cannot manage it then they cannot go outside. I would work on that strongly - no exceptions. Really, is it so hard to remember? I don't think it's a Herculean task. <br>  <br>  You could keep them in a room upstairs but I don't think that's best because the kids should be able to remember. Take a few seconds to shut the door - make sure that it's shut. After all you do for them, it's the very least they can remember to do! <br>  <br>  Cats can jump over baby gates. One of mine does it all of the time. I keep the cats separated from the dog. We don't want the dog upstairs. One of my cats is nervous with the dog so it gives her a safe space. The dog doesn't seem to mind. He has free rein downstairs and the cats have free rein upstairs. <br>  <br>  Eventually the cats should become used to being indoor only. I think it will take a year. One of my cats was indoor/outdoor. She passed away after 10 years with me. I think it took at least a year for her to get used to it. It wasn't constant - just now and then as I recall. After a while, she had no desire to go outside - perfectly content inside. I played with her - combed her - took good care of her. I had her put down because of cancer and she was getting very sick - lost her zest for life - vet recommended it.<br>  <br>  I took in a stray kitten - it was easy to get her to adjust. She must have been an indoor kitten at one time. I think so. Although now she's getting bolder and coming closer to the door so I have to watch her like a hawk. I don't think she would go out but why chance it.|`|Uf5rzy0oaa	you can by animal pens for the outside at any petco or petsmart that way they can get out in the sun but cant get out in the street. or install a screen door in the back so you can have vintilation in the house while not letting the cat get out|`|Si9hhcW1aa	You can get a screen door and make sure there is a hydraulic on it so that when the kids run in and out of the house the door will close on its own and you can still get the breeze from outside. Baby gates won't work. You could also try to teach the kids to close the door behind him if you don't have a screen door. Good luck. I love my kitties too!|`|wrhG6b1laa	Try training them on a leash, and also try putting up a baby gate on the door so that way your kids can go in and out and your cats will stay in. plus you can also put the cats in a play pin but it is designed for animals. good luck.|`|NPr6dVYZaa	What kind of fencing do you have?

ZuFVHsRpaa	Since Degus are herbivores they should naturally eat vegetable but maybe it will take the a little bit of time to get used to what you are feeding them. Try to make sure the veggies aren't too cold for them and make sure they are fresh not frozen. That should help.|`|l8gUwy2daa	Try www.degus.org<br>  I am in the military and am on a Government computer, so some sites we just can't get to.

AA11992723	go ahead with the blood test it will tell you if kidney enzymes are high, dark urine could be blood or high protein. Even puppies can suffer kidney disease usually due to genetics. urinating every hour is not normal. make sure to not restrict water intake for now because if she is kidney compromised she needs to drink as much as possible to help flush out the toxins from her kidneys. A full blood panal should not cost $100..<br>  <br>  It is very important you do the blood test. Also kidney disease if this is what it is, is NOT cheap. you might want to think about putting this puppy into foster care with a rescue group if you do not think you can afford further treatment. she is a puppy and will most likely be rehomed fast even with a medical condition, or at least get care from a foster.<br>  <br>  P.s. urine incontinence from early spaying happens later in adulthood usually after age 5. urine wouldnt be dark either if incontinence and it also would be more leaking not urinating every hour.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Is she spayed,if the answer is yes then a female can sometimes have bladder urges and need to go.There is a pill called Proin and this helps urinary incontinece really well.Ask the doc about this pill and see if he can prescribe it and it is something she will need to be on the rest of her life.|`|YV1bOajXaa	You have come this far with her, you might as well get the blood test done to rule out a kidney problem.  I was going to say that maybe she was drinking too much, but then the urine would not be dark.  Does the food you feed her have a high protein level?  If it does, you might want to consider switching to another brand until you hear something from the vet about the blood test.|`|Jj6lJDajaa	perhaps your dog has a bladder problem like mine. she pees like every hour aswell, she'd just sit on me bed asleep and start weeing randomly without noticing. It also could be something your feeding him, maybe he's a bit dehydrated so he drinks loads of water? x|`|PoiQKGfgaa	what vet are you going to i hope not Banfield they are a rip off all they want to do is test i would go to a regular vet an check with them first|`|jmz0VTR7aa	At your pup's age, it is not normal to be having to urinate every hour. I would have to agree with the vet that there is something wrong, if not a UTI, than possibly a kidney problem. Just the fact that the vet noted her urine is dark tells you something is wrong. Urine should not be concentrated. That indicates a problem. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it looks like you probably need to try to find the money for the blood work, or ask the vet to let you work out a payment plan. Most vets will work with you. You could also try going to another vet for a second opinion.
enC9TvxUaa	-Cockatiel is a great smaller bird, very loving, smart, and would be very quiet at night- he will need for you to let him sleep in total quiet too!  Try finding one that is hand raised, NOT one from a local Petsmart!|`|g6sNQ7p1aa	Oh how neat! I got my first bird when I was 13 and it was a cockatiel. I loved that bird to death... She was the sweetest bird to work with. She always stepped up onto my finger and loved a good head scratching. <br>  <br>  Caution about the cat: cat saliva contains a bacteria called Pastruella (spelling?) and it is toxic to all birds. If your cat so much as TOUCHES your bird, it could die. Birds and cats are natural enemies, and the stress of the cat walking around your room is very dangerous to a cockatiel. I know you'll do your best to prevent that from happening, but it's good info to know!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and go to birdbreeders.com or avianbiotech.com to search for local breeders. I used to work at Petsmart and believe me, the birds are not healthy nor are they tame.|`|dunrFTe4aa	maybe a canary,budgies and cockatiels can be very noisy if they dont get enough attention,also you cant keep big birds like that in a room on their own,canarys are small cute and will sing a lovely song to get notice them!|`|5zEg16FSaa	Cockatiel would be one of you're best bets but u could also consider a Budgie there also wonderful first time birds|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	COCKATIEL!!!!|`|3YHZUuhyaa	I would suggest a lovebird or a cockatiel. do NOT get it from a pet store. find a breeder nearby and get one from them.

Small amounts of cheese spread, bits of kibble or other treats, dried fruit, and even bits of cereal (nothing sugary or chocolaty) ex. use cereal like cheerios. I even heard that you can plug up the holes in the ends and freeze meat soup inside, just make sure to give it to your dog outdoors because it will be a mess if it melts on carpet. Hope I helped!|`|C9VXUKGpaa	Cheese (like the can spray stuff) plus you can put kibble in it. if you have time you can make your own dog treats to put in there. if you don't have time you can use store bought and break them up. you can probably use whatever your dogs go crazy for!

3BMBZtDxaa	Honestly, it's best to get her spayed. There aren't any side-effects to getting an Australian Shepherd spayed. I've looked into it as well (I plan on being an Aussie owner soon!) and it honestly doesn't have any side-effects. <br>  <br>  Spaying your dog will protect her from uterine infections, false pregnancy, breast cancer, and getting pregnant. Many dogs die from giving birth which is not something you want to risk! Also, if you have your dog liscensed, it's often cheaper if your dog is spayed. Not to mention you won't have to deal with those heat cycles anymore!<br>  <br>  I think the only bad things about spaying is the fact that it costs money and that your dog will be put under anesthesia which could be a risk. There's no such thing as a dog getting fat and lazy after being spayed, so don't worry! As for the breed itself, there aren't any side-effects like them not performing well in herding classes or becoming less active/obedient. They are basically their same selves without the heat cycles and sometimes moodiness.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have a lot of "manly" dogs in your area, that means they are tough! So one day while you have your dog in your backyard or something, one of those male dogs can get loose and come mate with your dog, even if your female is unwilling. It happened to one of my aunt's dog. She didn't get her spayed because she was a great show dog, and a stray male hopped the fence and force bred her. The female caught a STD and she died soon after because of it. I'm sure you don't want to same fate for your dog!<br>  <br>  I would HIGHLY suggest getting your dog spayed. Without any lasting side-effects an prevention against cancers and your dog dying, I would definitely get her spayed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	You need to search the internet for information on the MDR1 gene found in Aussies.  Research this and print information about it and give it to your vet.  Your vet is going to have to watch the anesthesia and pain killers she gives your dog.  You should also be careful with this breed and Heart worm meds.  Inteceptor would be better than heart guard for Aussies.  The ivamac in heartguard could cause problems in Aussies, Collies, Shelties and Border Collies. I guess I gave my information packet to my vet so she could train her staff.  Try assa.org/health.  I think you could just type MDR1 gene in your search engine.  I have had several shelties spayed over the years and have not had any problems.|`|bIaywrBCaa	spaying is the best thing you can do for her. I had an aussie and few years ago and she was an awesome aussie!|`|GSf09ALBaa	To my knowledge there are no harmful effects to spaying or neutering any dog that has been proven.<br>  <br>  There is speculation from different sources that hormone replacement therapy is needed to reduce bone loss, etc as they age. <br>  <br>  Now, this is speculation and the HRT recommended is natural.  So, right now I say no.  But I am watching this closely.|`|OFpl236faa	I haven't heard of any ill effects on the breed. I know of many Aussies who have been spayed and done well. The hardest thing is keeping them quiet after the procedure because they are such an active breed. Invest in a lot of chewies and kongs to keep her busy :)|`|3zv2bbolaa	There are no harmful effects at three years of age. Please do spay!|`|Rqb9gPN5aa	I have Border Collies, all of which are spayed/neutered.  There are NO harmful effects.  As you certainly know, not spaying/neutering gives the dog a much more likely chance of certain cancers.  <br>  <br>  My dogs are all working dogs.  You should see if you can find a reputable sheepdog trainer and get your dog on livestock, what she was bred to do.  <br>  <br>  The only possible effect that spaying could have, is incontinence.  My dog has that from the spay, but the vet gives us meds that take care of that problem.|`|C9VXUKGpaa	I'm not totally sure what your asking but I recommend on getting her fixed. getting her fixed will reduce her risks of ovarian and breast cancer. it will also help pet overpopulation by not adding to the problem.

Aussies are just a little different from all the others lol.<br>  <br>  There are no reasons not to spay your Aussie and tons of reasons you should.  Get her spayed.|`|HJ3mGLGGaa	there are no cons to getting a dog fixed. never let anyone talk you out of it. <br>  <br>  pros of getting her spayed:<br>  1. her lifespan will be nearly doubled<br>  2. she will not go through "false pregnancy syndrome" <br>  3. she will be less likely to mark/pee as often<br>  4. she will have a more controllable amount of energy<br>  5. she will be able to sleep easier, rather that a dozen quick naps a day.<br>  6. she can get a long with other dogs better<br>  7. she won't go through heat<br>  8. stray dogs won't come into your yard<br>  9. you will have better leadership skills with her, she will be easier to train<br>  10. less health problems

YLYAo2zmaa	I agree that your dog just got very excited to see her Auntie, my nephew came over once after handling a female in heat and my dog just pooped right beside him in a heartbeat. the dog was 9 years old at the time and was very house trained.|`|GSf09ALBaa	To be really honest I think your little Chi was really excited to see Auntie and likes her.  Often, excitement will lead to urinating or pooping.  I hope Auntie did not take it badly.  The Chi just got overly excited.|`|YV1bOajXaa	Did she do something to scare the poop out of him, lol?!   Maybe he got so excited he just lost control of himself.   I wouldn't worry about it unless it happens again.
AA11732293	I had a sun conure  and SHE WAS LOUD.  I would say an 8 or a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.  If you don't want a loud bird, a sunny is not for you.  Still, she is probably the best pet I ever had; she loved to fly to me and snuggle snuggle snuggle, and she learned to say a few simple phrases.  Unfortunately she passed away in November after 7 years--she had kidney failure and someday I'd love to have another one.<br>  <br>  I HIGHLY recommend a conure if you have the time for one, and if you can take the noise.  Unlike the aforementioned Jenday, a Sunny is loud all of the time.|`|lNzhglLFaa	Jendays are louder but more often friendlier... kind of a catch 22. they are really only loud like 2 times during the day though... in the morning (like 8ish) and in the afternoon (like 5ish) but they are great little birds
Bw18seFqaa	its not a "breed"   you have an over-priced mutt with a made up name attatched for marketing purposes...   he also should have stayed with his mom for at least another week.<br>  <br>  Dont spoil him..  leave the food and water sit.. he will eventually get hungry and thirsty and will eat.  Remember he's new to the household and has to adjust to the routine.<br>  <br>  Ignore his cries.  If you give in and give him attention, he learns that crying gets what he wants.  Wear him out before bed, give him a potty break, put him in his crate, and ignore his crying.   He will eventually get tired of crying and go to sleep.  Only take him out for a potty break.. otherwise ignore him.  The first few nites or so will be sleepless nites, but he will learn that its bedtime and go to sleep.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the chewing.. when he's chewing something he shouldnt be, firmly tell him "NO" then immediatly take it from him, and exchange with one of his own chew things..  then praise.  Do not take something away without giving something in return!  Otherwise you teach him that a certain object is valuable, and he will want to make a game out of it, and he will start to play "keep away" and run with items.. let him think he's getting something better for relenquishing the forbidden item!<br>  <br>  When he bites on yourself and your clothing..  yelp "OUCH" in a high pitched tone.  If he continues, yelp "OUCH!" again.. walk away and ignore him for 10-15 mins.  This tells him "you are playing too rough, Im not having fun, game over"<br>  <br>  Do praise him for all appropriate interactions... playing with his own toys, letting you pet him without biting, etc.  Encourage the use of toys for play, not your hands.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	what should you know?  that you paid way too much money for a mutt with a fancy name and no reputable breeder would ever breed mutts and puppies should not go to there new home until they are 8 weeks old.
0m6BgESXaa	"The dog is almost a year old, has been eating and drinking for almost a year now and the dog is fine."<br>  <br>  You'd be amazed at how much a puppy's bite can change in a year...<br>  <br>  I know a puppy that had a perfect bite at 8 weeks...at one year she was undershot AND wry mouthed...<br>  <br>  To the OP, I would also suggest consulting again with your vet.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Sounds to me she has an undershot jaw.  Have your vet take a good look at her jaw alignment.  I have a Dachshund that way.  No harmful side effects.  Just looks funny when the tip of his tongue is out.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I really don't understand the question?The dog is almost a year old, has been eating and drinking for almost a year now and the dog is fine. The question I have is how come this was'nt noticed before as a young puppy when he had his vet check.I could see if at birth you di'nt see this but you have had the dog again for almost a year.What does the vet say now????|`|3zv2bbolaa	They usually need surgery to correct it to allow for proper use of the tongue while drinking. Obviously it hasn't caused much of an issue, but your vet would be better able to advise you on the necessity of any surgery.|`|mRevWUxlaa	Call the veterinarian and ask if there is a surgery that can be done. They may refer you to a specialist. Good Luck!!!|`|teDI6RQ8aa	Your dog may just have a short tongue.  One of my dogs was like that.  Never caused him any problems.

wF52XMxAaa	I'm sorry your bird died.  I fear we'll face the same situation soon.<br>  <br>  While seizures can cause strokes, strokes can also cause seizures.  <br>  <br>  We have a bird with episodes of congestive heart failure which cause seizures (in his case, one leg fails, he gets confused, and one eye dilates.  He's a rescue bird,  So far we've nursed him through nearly 3 years of heart problems, but last time the vet said "Be glad you've had two years", so we've been spoiling him even more).<br>  <br>  Heavy metal poisoning (most often zinc, from galvanized cages or quick links) can also cause seizures.
SLSX6QQsaa	Sounds like it. Also after she has the babies, she can get pregnant right away.  You shouldn't let her outside anymore if you plan on keeping her as your pet for years to come.  The average lifespan of an outdoor cat is only 4 years and indoor cats its 15 years.  Also, while its great that you plan on finding homes for the babies, do you realize that you just took away willing homes from cats in shelters that will now be put to sleep?  Its the sad truth, there are way more cats than willing homes.  And another caution, I found a cat outdoors, a very pretty all white cat with big blue eyes.  How someone could leave her outside to fend for herself, I can't imagine how.  One of my friends took her in and gave her a great home for 2 weeks, then one day she came home from work only to find blood from one end of her apartment to the other.  The cat was pregnant and was hemmoraging, bleeding to death!  Apparantly her body was not mature enough to have kittens and she was having a miscarriage.  The vet guessed that this cat was somewhere around 10 months old.  The cat almost died, but since my friend is such a great cat mom, she spent $1500 at the vet, saving the life of a cat she only had for 2 weeks.  Now this cat is doing great and she was lucky to have a happy ending to her story but most are not so lucky.  Please think about what you are doing in the future.  This is a much worse situation than you realize.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	yes- it sounds like you have a momma cat on your hands! =)<br>  Take her to the vet just to double check though.  If there's a lot of feral males hanging around the house and you let her outside (unspayed) then there is a high chance of her being pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Before you give the babies to your friends - the kittens need to stay with their mother for at least 10 weeks.  So dont give them up till after that|`|sFPV2KbBaa	I'm not trying to give a lecture, but dear a cat can go into heat when it is 5 month old and have a litter of it's own.  if you baby is with litter, happy for you.  glad that you have found good homes.  if it doesn't work with the homes get them back.  try not to give them away before they are ten weeks old or so.  the more that they learn from mom, the better.|`|8b0371c5bc0739c08be383e6d4849356aa	yes|`|yxJKgf9Faa	she could well be pregnant but the only sure sign will be later on when her stomach begins to get larger and by placing your hand lightly on her stomach in time you should be able to feel the kittens moving!<br>  <br>  good luck x
bRVHkjTXaa	Go get the unflavored pedialyte keep it on hand at all times, add it to the drinking water today. Try 25% to 75%water .Make sure your dog has had all of the shots (corona & parvo) 4 series as a pup not just three (learned that the hard way,pup survived-checkbook did not) 1 every year there after,do not ever skip this. Buy a metal container for your pet food a trash can with a foot pedal for the lid is ideal.. Worm your dog every 6 months  If your dog will not eat go the 60 miles now.|`|7d4ibEnKaa	yes they can, mice carry a lot of disease in their droppings.  If the mouse pooped in his bowl and your dog ate it, you can be looking at a number of parasite infestations. Roundworm comes to the top of my mind, but there are many more.<br>  <br>  Bring your dog to the vet and catch everything early, it will save you a headache and lots of money too.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Yes, there are problems your dog can get from mice.  If the dog isn't feeling better in a day or two or if his symptoms get significantly worse, you'll have to drive that 60 miles, both ways, and take your dog to the vet.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	do you keep your mutt's food in a mouse-proof container?<br>  <br>  do you wash your dogs food dish daily?<br>  <br>  Do you pick up any kibble left on the floor after meals?<br>  <br>  if the anwer to ANY of these is no, then it is possible.  Mice are filthy, they are flea ridden disease bags with legs.<br>  <br>  maybe you should ask your vet what's wrong with your dog....|`|pvgwJwxvaa	why are mice getting into your dogs food?  stop leaving it out!<br>  <br>  if your dog is sick, you need to find a vet!
UNFxjNHkaa	she probably ran away to give birth.  Some cats just find a quiet place in the house and other's like to go to more private places outside.  Dont worry, she'll most probably be back.  But I'd encourage you to try to find her (for the kittens sake) - Put up posters, go to your local shelters... do whatever you can|`|yxJKgf9Faa	she will begin to find places to give birth and begin *nesting* as labour gets closer she will begin to pant and let out high pitched meows with each contraction.....but because you cannot find her the only way to tell if she has had her kittens when she comes back is by feeling the stomach does she look thinner and is she lactating(nipples very enlarged)....these will be sure signs that shes given birth.....for the safety of her and her kittens i hope you find her x
OAzJPUkHaa	It would be best if you get more shells.  The minimum is three shells per crab(more is always recommended and better), meaning you should have at least six.  It's always best to buy natural shells online, at Wal Mart, a craft store like Michales, or a tourists shop for the sake of saving money.  A bag of shells(or individual shell in the case of online sites and tourists shops) will definitely cost you less than one or two shells at a pet shop.<br>  The digging is very normal(assuming your tank conditions are in order, mainly the temperature).  Some crabs enjoy digging and being underground, the crab could be molting(where they shed their skin, crabs will do it a few time a year depending on size), or he's destressing if new.  <br>  It's best to leave him alone and not disturb him.  You'll be able to tell if he's molted by his black, sharp claws on the end of his leg, and he'll generally be hairier.  Feed him foods rich in calcium, protein, and chitin(insect exos, etc) when he comes back up if he's molted(should be included in his diet anyway).    <br>  Give your tank setup, diet, temperature, and humidity if you want some advice.|`|r0u26SYGaa	you shouldn't be too worried about it. i was really amazed when my hermit changes into a new shell, only to find 2 days later she changes back in front of me. then my big hermit crab changes his shell and then back, and then to new, and then back, and then to a different one, and then old one, and then even different one, and then to the old one...so he changes all the time. and by the way: about the digging and underground, hes probably getting ready to molt soon!|`|e8D6Qvimaa	It is probably due to endocrine hormones that fluctuate the size of the crab.  It is possible that it might start changing colors but don't worry, this routine changing.|`|hKfVit0Laa	please go to this link and check it out it will tell you everything you need to know on them.

f5618aa35eb852f89f010c9c3dd474a7aa	i used to have a chinese hamster and he was like yours is, really fast in his cage and i could never catch him, i used to have to wait for him to climb out of his cage onto my hand, once i was holding him he would calm down, i can't remember what treats i used to give him but i have a golden hamster now and he loves blueberries or pear|`|aI1xCe9Laa	It is normal. I have 2 chinese dwarf hamsters. One of them is very fast and the other one is very slow and loves to be picked up and lay on my hand and walk down and up my arm. Its normal. Also you can buy some really good treats from pets at home. This week I brought hamster popcorn and chocolate. And they loved it. They also love Carrot, Orange and grapes. Grapes are a great thing to give your hamsters cause they need little portions and 1 grape is perfect size. Anyway i hope i helped.|`|jw4DqiCraa	Yes, these hamsters are known to be very fast. So don't worry! <br>  I am not sure about when you hold her but she might just have a calm temperament and is happy to be around you. <br>  There are many treats available, i used to feed my hamster 'hamster Chocolate drops' as her treat she loved them. She also liked the popcorn sticks. <br>  Good luck, hope this helps :)|`|yJWr6TxMaa	Sounds completely normal. Hamsters take a long time to trust us, they are very nervous animals. If she allows you to handle her, then she must know that you don't mean her any harm.<br>  You could try small pieces of carrot, apple, broccoli, banana, kale etc. as a treat.
UNFxjNHkaa	I've never heard of spinach being harmful to cats. In fact (if I remember correctly) it's a common ingredient for people who blend their own cat food, because it's a good source of vitamins & such.<br>  <br>  ADD><br>  The ASPCA poison experts say a tiny bit should be OK for most, but since it contains calcium oxalates, which can cause urinary tract crystals, don’t feed it regularly. Also, any cat with a history of urinary problems should never eat spinach.|`|1SxFP1Chaa	It's just fine. They make cat food now with garden veggies in it.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It is okay, in fact, it can also help with digestion.
QV6swGUMaa	not to sure about the air but if the net is at the top of the tank they should be fine put it near the filter so a flow goes through it.i used a 6mm tube to suck out things at the bottom and watch out for the fry.if ya do suck one up put him back.good luck.maybe think about changing the tank for there own one so ya can change the water regulary.make sure the levels in your tank are good. good luck.|`|tShDXmgbaa	Though I do not believe in using breeder nets for the problems you are having...You need to go get a cheap Turkey Baster and syphon the poop & uneaten food out. You also need to siphon some of the oxygenated tank water back into the breeder net and this should be done daily or every other day.  Otherwise ammonia will build up in the net since it holds stagnant water and kill your fry.|`|J6IA3tmsaa	You Need not put the air stone right underneath the mesh.You can also add an apple snail to clean up the poo or the left over food.Remember if the water is being aerated  with the bubbles that means that the whole water is being oxygenated

eyZhiXYpaa	First of all can I say that I wish there were more people out there like you who obviously care for animals in need.<br>  <br>  I totally understand though that you can only do so much with regard to stray animals due to expense.<br>  <br>  If you have cats that are not ID'd or wear no tag i.e. strays, I would take them to the shelter.  Stray cats are constantly being hit by cars on the roads.  I would try and find out if any of the cats belong to neighbours first though - maybe put a poster up.<br>  <br>  What ever you do, don't feed them, just stick with feeding the one you have saved (and you other pets of course).<br>  <br>  Good for you.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	I would go to the store and get the least expensive kind of dry food available.  Thats better than the garbage the poor outdoor cats will be stuck eating, or eating nothing at all :(  I know you can get a huge bag of Purina cat chow for about $10 and it lasts my 2 cats (eating unlimited amounts) for 4 months.  I am sure you could feed a lot of cats with it, for not too much $$.  If you can't afford it, the best thing to do would be to take the cats to a NO KILL shelter so they are able to get proper care and nutrition.  Its sad that there are so many homeless cats out there.   While you could bring the one you know into your home (permanently indoor cat) you would still be leaving a bunch of hungry kitties outside :( Its so sad, I know.<br>  <br>  <br>  Aww he looks exactly like my first cat (lived to be 27!!!) named Dr. Spock.  btw I didn't name him, my father found him in a dumpster at his first apartment when he was 18, 6 years before me lol.   Hes so cute and if his looks are any factor in his personality, Dr. Spock was the sweetest cat I have ever had.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	uh oh!  looks like you've opened pandora's box with this one - It is okay that you're feeding them - but you have to realize that as long as you keep putting food out, they'll keep coming.  Even if you're only putting food down for that original stray.  You either have to feed them all, or feed none of them.<br>  <br>  Or you can try to catch the original stray and keep him indoors.  I know you said its hard to catch him but you'll have to try harder if you want to keep him!<br>  <br>  Oh my goodness!  He's gorgeous!  You have to keep him forever and ever - otherwise, i'll take him.. lol =)|`|sFPV2KbBaa	or you could call animal services and give them your situation, that you are feeding a number of cats, mostly strays and a litter of kits.  and tell them that the cats you don't want around are well fed indoor/outdoor cats that have owners and to do something about it.  there should a local by-law pertaining to this kind of thing.
JGq9rKBOaa	Have you considered a modified C&C cage?<br>  <br>  They're meant for guinea pigs - instructions are available at <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/</a> - but many people use the same materials to build cages for other animals. They have a photo gallery so you can see how other people have adapted them.<br>  <br>  To better suit degus, you can use grids with smaller openings, a deeper base, a top, an added "dig area" made out of a plastic bin - really, there are all sorts of possibilities.<br>  <br>  Be creative! Don't feel limited to wood and wire mesh, there are all sorts of materials out there that make great cages.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	don't use wood they will eat it you have to use metal and glass no plastic either.|`|yJWr6TxMaa	Degus need a large glass tank which they are unable to chew.

AJXyRRBcaa	My budgie enjoys toys with bells attached to them. Make sure the toys are suited for budgies. Don't get a mirror as the bird is more likely to ingore you and a swing is always popular. That cage is good to start with as you will probably be getting a baby, you will need a bigger one later. Just buy general seed from the shops and millet spray, they like millet and seed sticks. Also an idoine/calcuim block. You can use newpaper for the bottom. I clean my budgies cage once a week, make sure you get a seed catcher which is a piece of material that goes around the cage to stop seed from being spilt over the side of the cage. They sleep on a perch, get perches with sandpaper or something similar so they can trim thier claws and beeks and get perches of different sizes and textures ( i have a rubber perch, two perches with grit on them and an idoine perch). You don't need two budgie cause then they won't be that interested in you. As long as you pay lots of attenton to your bird, it will be fine. Name it a simple name so that if it does talk (no gaurantee) it will be easier to say. A male is better to get but if your getting a baby (eg: 7 weeks old) you wont know. Get a budgie from a private seller, that way you know your getting a baby. It will be easier to tame and cause its so young is more likely to bond to you.  Get an old towel to cover your budgie at night so that way it will know when bedtime is. It is better if you get a male cause they are more likely to talk and less fiesty. Each bird has there own personality ( mine loves music and he always chirps away to it).|`|b8f0567cc965cfac3a2b7aa6564ba025aa	No offense intended but judging from your questions and your own confession you certainly do need someone to give you some pointers on bird care.|`|nTmra1qnaa	Before I answer your questions here are just a few things to think about; <br>  Budgies can be messy & noisy & destructive. They poop everywhere & often. They chew & will chew picture frames & mirror frames & if they are free to fly in your home will fly up to the highest point in your room & that's usually the window frame or curtain rail. So there will be poop in your drapes.<br>  <br>  If you don't want a messy pet. Then you have to decide if you want a budgie. Budgies need exercise so they need to be free for a short time from their cage. Can you allow that & not freak out from the mess & trouble your bird gets into ?<br>  <br>  Budgies are intelligent and they need alot of attention if your bird is going to be left at home for more than 7hrs I just personally think that it wouldn't be fair keeping a single bird, two birds is definatly best to prevent boredom. A bored bird can pick up some pretty awful habits, biting, feather plucking/chewing, screaming all day, pacing.<br>  <br>  Just a few things to consider before buying. <br>  <br>  The cage your looking at is not suitable its tiny have you looked at the measurements! you need to be looking at cage like this <a href="http://tinyurl.com/alyf2b" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/alyf2b</a> and it MUST have wooden perches, when Budgies are in the wild they don't stand on plastic. <br>  <br>  As for the bird or hopefully birds your going to buy than I would recommend you buy male birds which are no older than 8 weeks, this way you can hand train them. You don't want to keep the bird in the cage for 24hrs a day as it will go mad you NEED to let it out and if its hand trained it will just come over to you by your command and you can just put the bird back in its cage.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you buy sand paper for the bottom of the cage you can buy this from pet stores. <br>  <br>  They sleep on there perch. <br>  <br>  They eat seeds, millet spray (which they adore), orange, apple etc, whatever you do don't feed it chocolate, avocardo as it will kill the bird. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck with your decision.|`|l1qWh9vSaa	a budgie will like most toys, don't clutter the cage tho, the cage your looking at is a bit small really, unless you have it out alot of the time. you can just ask for your seed in your local pet shop, use grit paper on cage floor, and yes they sleep on the perch, you dont need a bed, lol, enjoy and buy some books for more info.|`|09e41Hdwaa	Don't listen to Coke, they have NOOO clue what they are talking about!<br>  <br>  Before I answer you questions, I must ask, how old are you and do you plan on going away to college?  What are you going to do with the bird if you do?  You can't have pets in college dorms, and budgies live around 10 years.<br>  <br>  Questions...<br>  Which toys do budgies enjoy most?<br>  <br>  Birds like to shred and they like bells.  I've bought pretty acrylic toys for birds, and they primarily ignore them.  Buy it something it can destruct.  The more mess is can make them more it will enjoy it.<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753059#RatingsDetail" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  (The small one) <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753436" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  Something like this is great, it can be shredded and it makes noise!  My tiel loves it. <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754620" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  Would this cage be suitable for him/her?<br>  <br>  No, that cage is not suitable for a budgie.  That cage shouldn't be made for any birds, period.You need something large enough that you can fit toys, perches, bowls, and possibly a happy hut in, plus your bird.  The bigger the better, as long as the bar spacing is appropriate.  I wouldn't buy a cage from Petsmart, you can get better deals online, but if I were, this would be the best for a Budgie, although, ideally, you want more width than height in a cage. <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3039776" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  What kind of food should I get?<br>  <br>  Your bird needs a quality seed mix like Volkman brand.  Petsmart won't have it.  DON'T buy Petsmart seed, it is low quality and dirty.  You will have to buy it online or at a specialty bird store.  Buy the kind for budgies, but with no sunflower seeds.  Kaytee brand and Prettybird are crap when it comes to everything, stay away from them!  You budgie will also need to eat pellets, you will have to force it to eat them.  Ask about this later because this is a lot to type out, and no, I don't mean physcial force...Anyways, Petsmart WILL have Zupreem brand pellets, and they are decent, just buy the kind without dye.  Other good brands are Harrison's, Lafeber's, and Roudybush.  Buy some treats too.  Spray millet is good,  Nutriberries, Avicakes, and Nutrimeal are good.  They are all Lafeber's brand.  You should also buy a cuttle bone.  They also need fresh fruits and veggies daily, but not avocado, mushrooms, or onions.<br>  <br>  Do I need to buy some kind of litter for the bottom of the cage, or can i use newspaper?<br>  <br>  Use newspaper or paper towels.<br>  <br>  Do they just sleep on the perch, or do I need to buy something for it to sleep on too?<br>  <br>  Some sleep on a perch.  I would buy it a cozy corner since it might like it.<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753645" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  You also need to buy perches, a variety of them.  If birds have one type of perch their feet might become deformed.<br>  Natural are good <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2752752" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754276" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  Rope perches are good as well.  I can't find them on Petsmart site, but I promise they will have them in the store.  They look like this.<br>  <a href="http://www.windycityparrot.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=20401812006&Category_Code=accfabric&Product_Count=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.windycityparrot.com/Merchant2...</a><br>  <br>  Other than that I would buy it a swing.  It will probably enjoy it.<br>  <br>  do i need to buy two, to keep each other company?<br>  If you want birds to look at two, if you want a companion that will come and play, one.  It isn't impossible with two, but you are new to birds, so one will be best for you.<br>  <br>  Buy about 6 of these bowls for putting treats in.  Stick them in the top shelf of your dishwasher and they do just fine. <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754286" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  Lastly, don't buy one from a chain pet store.  The birds come from bird mills and are in poor health and will be wild.  Look for a budgie breeder in your area that sells hand FED not hand raised babies.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you will need a lot more help.  Sign up here.  We'll help you with your new bub. <a href="http://www.tailfeathersnetwork.com/community/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tailfeathersnetwork.com/commu...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: Don't buy it a mirror, either.  It might think it's reflection is another bird and it will show no interest in you.  It depends on the bird, but I wouldn't risk it.|`|2yAGGcIVaa	Budgies enjoy toys they can chew on and toys that make sounds like a bell.The cage you picture isn't okay for a budgie.Budgies enjoy large cages to spread their wings and to jump around in.You should get a largish cage.This one is the best for 1 budgie <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754296" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  You should get it this food<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753463" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  You can use just newspaper but make sure to replace it every 2 days or else your budgie could get an infection from the smell of its feces.<br>  Budgies sleep on the perch.It may dig its head in its wings so don't be alarmed when this happens.It's just taking a nap.A lot of owners get alarmed if one of it's legs are "missing" but it is just resting as well by putting one foot up like a flamingo.It may also rub it's beak against the bottom or top half which means its getting comfortable.If you want baby budgies then you should get two.One of the opposite gender.You can tell if its a boy or girl by looking at their noses.It the nose is blue then it's a boy.If it's pink and turn a light blue at a point then you have a girl.Most budgies perfer to have a friend so I suggest you get 2 budgies and a bigger cage if so.This cage here lasted me 6 years before I gave away my budgies.It was useful and had a large enough space for 4 budgies. This cage is the one I perfer for you who is a first time budgie owner.I think it's the perfect cage for you.Make sure you look and spend time with the parakeet so it could get used you.You should be the one providing it food and water as well so it could see you as the giver of something good.Then it should come to like you.Make sure you clip its wings.This can be done at your local veteranarian for a small fee.I wish you luck on your first parakeet.They are so smart and fun.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754308" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a>|`|wE5iJZynaa	Congratulations on your choice of pet!<br>  I have always wanted a budgie, but I am not allowed to get one.<br>  My neighbors have some budgies, and hers enjoy the bell toys and the ones with treats attatched.<br>  The cage you have picked out is perfectly fine.<br>  You should get the bird food they have at the store, no need to buy the "premium" food, it only costs more and makes no difference.<br>  You need to buy the litter for the bottom, you can find that in the parakeet aisle too.<br>  They just sleep on the perch, be sure to get a few more, and LOTS of toys, and you need to buy a vitamin rock for them to bite off of, too.<br>  You clean the tray around once a week.<br>  You should buy two, to keep each other company. :)<br>  Be sure to get a mirror,too, they love those.<br>  Hope this helps!
ad3b5cd523444e3461eb988f6ede1f97aa	thats so sad , i am so sorry , i didnt move once because they wouldnt accept my cat, can you find a new place that will accept pets ? if not call a vet , ask for numbers for no kill shelters, some of them have foster homes for cats , and if you give them to a good home , ask these questions what are you plans for the cat ? are they going to live inside where it is safe ? and do you have kids that will get along with my cats ? i would prefer calling a shelter and asking about a foster home for them but find a no kill shelter|`|UNFxjNHkaa	Wait, wait, wait.  Im confused.  Just because you're moving doesnt mean that you have to leave your cats behind.  How long have you had them?  I could imagine that being pretty traumatizing for them because if you give them up, they'll probably have to be separated.  I've never met anyone that took in 3 cats all at once.<br>  <br>  I would never leave my babes - if i move, they come with me..  I could never even dream of leaving them!|`|VDP3pNCPaa	The first place I would start is to try and contact a rescue group.  Your vet may know of several.  Then, offer them some financial assistance in letting them place your cats.  If successful, they will make sure the cats get a good home.  But remember, they may be overwhelmed, so be persuasive.<br>  <br>  If doing it yourself, then ask for a vet reference.  And no college kids, as they may simply toss out the cat at the end of the semester, or may not be legally allowed to have one anyway.|`|1TiPo3Ezaa	Certain rescue groups will interview potential parents for you,but if you would like to do it yourself just make sure they have a vet, and ask if they'll give you an email address for picture updates,questions,etc.Also make sure you're able to drop them off at their new home,they'll feel more comfy if you leave them there rather than just giving them to the person..makes the transition a lot easier.|`|AA11286736	I suggest you find somewhere else to live. YOU took responsibility for these animals when you took them into your home and now you want to abandon them because "you can't take them with you"?!!?|`|wqL84O8Naa	wow, i guess there was only one other place to live in the whole wide world??|`|se27sAUwaa	I'm sorry but I just don't understand how you could move somewhere knowing that you can't take your pets with you. Part of being a responsible pet owner is knowing that you have someone relying on you (for the next 20 years) and that you have limitations now as to what you can and can't do. Same as with having a baby. <br>  <br>  Do they not allow pets where you are moving? If you had a child would you move somewhere that didn't want kids and adopt the kid out? Same difference. I hope, but seriously doubt, that someone is going to take in not 1, not 2, but 3 adult cats. Chances are they are going to get split up and hopefully will find a home. That's terrible though. Can you imagine the stress and hurt these poor cats are going to endure? Uhg. Terrible.
FewhKlx9aa	It sounds like she is trying to get their attention as that when they come up to her she is friendly.If she was scared she would run the other way.The best thing you can do is when she starts to bark is give her a tug on the leash and at the same time say IGNORE.Keep doing this till she associates the word ignore to the bark.I had a sheperd that did this and it worked beautifully|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Your Border Collie is a herding dog, surprise.  She is a herding dog, and that is what herding dogs do, they herd things.  She will herd other dogs, and gardens and children and people walking down the street.  If you have her in the car, she will bark at the trees passing by and try to herd them.  When the dogs come up to her she is fine because she has rounded up her herd.  ha ha  I think she would benefit from an activity like agility class.|`|OxFsslN8aa	If a dog is fearful of other dogs they will not be fine when the dog comes up to her.  I think you have misdiagnosed her problem.  It is more likely that she has pent up energy & is excited at the prospect of playing with the other dogs.  Just like people enjoy the company of other humans, dogs also enjoy the company of other dogs.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Are you sure that she is afraid?  I am fostering a poodle- papillion mix who does that, and he is not afraid of anything in this world :o)<br>  <br>  I think he does it to get the other dogs attention, and he also tends to "talk back" when he is corrected.<br>  <br>  I would just correct her as you would any other time her barking is inappropriate.|`|teDI6RQ8aa	It sounds more like she barks at them to get their attention.  She's very secure, or she wouldn't be doing this.  I would just ignore this behavior.  My dogs do this at the dog park some, and it's just because they want to "talk" to the other dogs on the other side of the fence.  Once they start talking and running the fence, all is well.  I just let it happen.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Well, she might be friendly, but if she behaves like that, she is not content. <br>  <br>  She needs a lot of socialization with other dogs in a controlled setting.  In other words, sign up for a group obedience class or two.|`|HJ3mGLGGaa	do not do what Nikko, Peke Lover told you try. it is on the right track, but not the best way to deal with it. <br>  <br>  if she fine when the dogs come up to her, then she is not afraid. her barking may be her being over excited. dogs growl, back away, tuck their tail between their legs, and bend their neck down if they are scared. <br>  <br>  have a friend with a dog who she has not met before help you with this. bring food treats with you, and it will be more effective if you do not do the training on your own property.<br>  <br>  if you dog starts barking when she sees the other dog, demand her attention on you. have her sit or lie down, and hold a treat up to your face, if she looks away from you, take the treat away and try again. when she holds her attention on you for up to 5 seconds, give her the treat and praise her. do this for about 4-5 times. then walk her towards the other dog, instead of the other dog come to you. she will be in the mood to please you, since you just completed some basic obedience cues. once the two dogs are together, pay attention to how they act.<br>  <br>  i don't think she is scarred of dogs, since she is ok when they come up to her. <br>  <br>  also, is she spayed? if your dog is not fixed, then that may be the main source to her barking when she sees another dog. especially if they other dog is a female or an unfixed male.|`|weHjvyZQaa	If you are dealing with a insecurity problem then you might notice that your dog is always scared and has his tail down constantly. It might help him to sleep in your bed as security or simply because it makes him feel safer than sleeping alone. There arernt many things that you can do to help your dog become less insercure.<br>  Maybe, if your really worried and its a big problem, take him to the vet.<br>  But maybe your dog hasnt got this problem, as dogs always bark at things, its there nature.<br>  :) Dont worry about your dog, theres nothing wrong <br>  x|`|tQm0mrvzaa	Watch "It's me or the dog" on Animal Planet.  Victoria Stilwell is amazing.
FewhKlx9aa	You should be with him then at all times and as soon as he goes say  firmly no when he turns to get at it and then pick it up.The other thing that works is a spray called Bitter Apple that you can get at any pet store.Spray this on it and see if it works|`|AA11992723	like almost everyone said, pick it up. You will get a parasite infestation in your yard if you don't clean it up. (hookworm, roundworms, giardia, etc) You will be at risk of getting infected as well as your dog.<br>  <br>  never leave a puppy esp one as small as shih tzus out alone esp at night!!!!! even a stray cat would severely hurt him.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Try Adolf's Meat Tenderizer (no joke) from the grocery store. The papaya enzyme makes the poop taste bad when it goes out the other end. Worked for my dog. Doesn't mean it'll work for your's though, but it's worth a try.|`|OxFsslN8aa	If you don't have time to pick it up right after he eliminates than learn not to worry about it.  As long as he eats his own and not from strange dogs, he will be fine.  This is a completely normal behavior for canines in the wild.  Just don't let him lick you and grin when he licks someone you think deserves it!!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Pick up the poo before he can eat it.<br>  <br>  And bitter apple on dog poo?  What??  Lordy, just pick up the poo lol!|`|pvgwJwxvaa	pick up his poop.|`|2914093d823c63f871f0d2f45ca1b544aa	He's eating his poop because there is some undigested food in it.  You may want to feed him at set times of the day and pick up his food when he's done.  Once you feed him, and give him a long walk him outside, not in your backyard or on newspaper.  He will eventually stop doing it.|`|lNzhglLFaa	deter. it is a pill or a powder that you put in his food... it makes his poop taste yuckie... <br>  <br>  it is natural that he is doing it by the way.. mommy dogs clean the whelping box by eating the puppies poo. so he sees his mom doing it... it must be okay.|`|fg3Bea21aa	You have to pick it up as soon as he does it, as it will break the habit, distraction is also good play with him as soon as he has had a poo.|`|7d4ibEnKaa	It's fairly normal what he's doing.  A lot of dogs will try to lick you afterward to.  Talk about a dirty mouth!!|`|nBehRANyaa	Just pick up the poop as soon as he goes.|`|teDI6RQ8aa	Clean up after he poops.  Be outside with him when he potties.|`|AA11207031	put a muzzle on him
VDP3pNCPaa	It most likely is feline acne.  Fairly common, and a cause sometimes is having plastic bowls, as the bowl edge supports bacteria.  If is looks like a cluster of blackheads, that is likely what it is.|`|AA12281930	it maybe black dirt|`|nBehRANyaa	Probably feline acne.  It's usually caused by bacteria on the cat's food and water dishes.  If you're using plastic dishes, try switching to metal.  Wash the dishes every day, preferably in the dishwasher.|`|egN478Bbaa	it could be flea dirt.  Brush some on a paper towel, wet it, and if it turns red, its flea dirt. Or he could have gotten in to something. :)
g0ZZGazLaa	If what you say is right then your cat is most likely pregnant.  Our cart was prego and she was the same pretty early on.  as it gets later in the last few weeks if you GENTLY press your palm to her belly and hold it still for a few minuets you will be able to feel them moving around. my cat had 5 kittens and you need to wait until their 4 pounds at least to fix them.  They don't even try to mate with Brothers and sisters till their at least over 8 months old. <br>  <br>  There is this place called Operation Pets that dose not cost alot.|`|Qw7ymfakaa	If you pop her along to your vet they should be able to tell you

lNzhglLFaa	they are great! the coo like any other dove... are inexpensive to keep and can live with other doves or finches... lots o fun!|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Never had one as a pet, but I care for them where I work. They aren't expensive to take care of, they're not too loud (like a parrot), but they aren't completely quiet.

HJ3mGLGGaa	have you neighbor help you with this. the last thing you want is for you neighbor to report you for having an aggressive dog. Daisy may not have been properly socialized as a puppy. Have you had both dogs since they were puppies? Has Daisy been around a lot of people, but not a lot of different dogs? Is Daisy fixed? Is the dog next door male or female, and is he?she fixed? it all has an effect of her. <br>  <br>  try teaching daisy some obedience cues, <br>  when you take her outside, demand her attention by having her sit and hold a food-treat up to your face. if she takes her attention off of you, put away the treat. until she sits and keeps her attention on you for up to 5 seconds, give her the treat. only do this practice when the neighbors dog is outside. Daisy will make the association that good things happen to her when the other dog is outside with her. praise her good behavior, and praise her when she pays no attention to the other dog. <br>  <br>  if Daisy is not fixed, this may be your main issue. if the other dog is male, Daisy may want to mate. if the other dog is female, daisy may be very territorial because of it.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	There may be a few reasons.  Your dog is probably not socialized very well.  Do you walk her, or just let her in the back?  Dogs need to smell and explore different things.  Maybe she is bored and wants to play with the other dog.  Is she neudered?  Is the other dog?  Maybe the other dog is initiating the barking.  Try introducing the dogs by walking them together.  Your neighbor will have to approve.  There could be other reasons.  Watch the "Dog Whisperer" on NGC.|`|GVzjM3tmaa	Several things are at work here.  Is the new dog male or female?  If female, fixed?  Female dogs are less likely to get along that a male and female (the ideal pair if you have two), or two males.  Are your dogs fixed?  Fixed dogs on average are less aggressive than unneutered dogs.  Your dog was there first.  She thinks that this is her territory.  Can she see through the fence?  You might try a visual deterrent if she can, but she will still see and hear the new dog.  Have you talked to the new neighbors about introducing your dogs on neutral territory, like a nearby park?  Your are correct that this is a territorial issue.  You are going to have to assert your dominance over your dog and make it clear to her that this behavior is not acceptable.  I have the same problem with my dog and human visitors.  You must be the alpha member of your "pack".  If you cannot do this, you might need a professional animal trainer to teach you the correct way to deal with the problem.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Your dog has been use to the area as hers and now the other dog moved onto her territory.If the other dog is female maybe thats why the male won't bother her or he may be older and could care less.The female is being very protective of her territory|`|KxjUim7yaa	The other dog may be a girl. Daisy is defending her turf from the new dog. Your male Billy doesn't mind because it is a girl.
GSf09ALBaa	Could be a pulled muscle, torn ligament or something to do with the bone.  Best to get to your vet for a full check up and xrays if necessary.|`|a634fc83e8cc678200f372815e1d735daa	yes it does sound like arthritis, but it could be something else a sprain or something, this may sound strange but my vet told me the same thing about my dog when she hurt her leg she told me to give it a day or two and then if it didnt go away or get better to take my dog in...and she did get better and was fine so id wait a day or two and if it doesnt get better take him in. good luck|`|FewhKlx9aa	He is definitly having a problem starting with maybe hip dysplaysia,as this is the age you would notice it.The vet can give you the correct answer though if he is still doing it this week.There is a vitamin that he can be given to help with those symptoms or he will preswcribe Rymidal.See what the vet says|`|kvHqnR5Haa	He could have something stuck in his paw.

O6r6Zqsuaa	The best food you can give a ferret is dry ferret food rom a pet shop, you can also give them dog food, but not on a long term basis as it does not have enough vitamins etc in it, you can also feed them on chicken and rice which they seem to enjoy, they can also have an occasional treat of sultanas.<br>  <br>  You can either keep them inside the house with you giving them their own room or what ever, or you can keep them outside in a cage, but make sure it has enough space or them to play in.<br>  <br>  They smell! so to combat this you can give them regular baths using ferret shampoos, also keep their living space clean to reduce the smell, the other thing is that you can get them neutered and have their glands removed.<br>  <br>  Ferrets are very hyper animals, so make sure that they have plenty to play with, and if you can't spend most of the day with them then i would recommend getting more than one. You can also take them for walks on a lead just like you would a dog, although they will not walk very well they will soon get used to it.<br>  <br>  When they are babies they will bite, so if you either flick their nose or squeeze their paw every time they bite you they will soon work out that it is bad for them to bite.<br>  <br>  Um... i think that's it, hope i helped.<br>   Here's some handy websites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.all-about-ferrets.com/total-ferret-info.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.all-about-ferrets.com/total-f...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Estates/5410/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Estat...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://my.en.com/~rcmcr/info.html" rel="nofollow">http://my.en.com/~rcmcr/info.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ferret-universe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferret-universe.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maferrets.org/info/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maferrets.org/info/index.htm</a>|`|mPfDlG2Laa	Both cats and ferrets are predators, and they do not do well with extremely young human children.  Wait till the boy is older.|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	How ferrets are with cats depends on the animals' personality.  Some are fine, some aren't.  You'll have to monitor introductions and play time (never leave ferrets and any other animal alone together).<br>  <br>  Honestly, ferrets only reek if they aren't taken care of properly (food, cage cleanings, laundry, etc).  If they ARE fed a high quality kibble, have their cage cleaned daily, have ferret laundry washed weekly and have INFREQUENT baths then they only have their own scent (like any dog or cat does).  Descenting doesn't do a thing about the smell--it's only altering that takes away the hormone induced odor and greasiness.<br>  <br>  Some enjoy walks on the harness and lead, some don't.  Mine don't *g*.  It takes training and patience for them to become accustomed to it.<br>  <br>  You should get at least a pair.  They generally look ferret company, and often need it (since we can't often spend ALL the time we should with them).  Unless, you get a ferret that doesn't like others--then, getting one would be fine.<br>  <br>  Vet care can be expensive, since they are 'exotics', but they DO need it (a schedule similar to dogs and cats, barring emergencies).<br>  <br>  They enjoy and need multi-level cages (the Ferret Nations are the safest and best cages for them)<br>  <br>  One ferret needs at least 6 hours of out of cage time, half of that with you.  Two or more need at least 4 hours out of cage time, half of that with you.<br>  <br>  They need a lot of mental stimulation (these guys are smart, so variety is important).<br>  <br>  Just some basics.  Research them very carefully before deciding one way or another--there is a lot to know about them and their care (they are not a low-maintenance animal).<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Ferrets are funny, sweet, friendly, adorable and cute, they do funny little dances and all around fantastic pets.<br>  <br>  With training, ferrets and cats usually get along great they love to play together however your cat can kill your ferret so you must supervise play at ALL times!<br>  <br>  However, YES, they smell. Descenting them is pointless, the smell comes from the oil in the coat, the smell remains the same with descenting.<br>  <br>  They are also terrors for biting until you train them out of it. They dont usually bite and hang on unless they are really angry, its more cheeky nips but you have to be prepared to be firm with them to stop them biting.<br>  <br>  Training them is also difficult, they are stubborn, they tend not to be 100% perfect with the litter tray no matter how much you try.<br>  <br>  They hate the harness at first but they will get used to it.<br>  <br>  Yes you need two or more ferrets, one will be lonely.<br>  <br>  Ferrets are great pets but they are expensive and high maintenance. I just spent ￡70 ($140) on my three for a routine check up and some wormer. They tend to be unhealthy as they get older and will rack up huge vets fees. They are similar to a cat or dog in terms of responsibility, think buying the highest quality expensive food to feed them, supplements, training, de-hairballing, claw trimming, ear cleaning, daily poop scooping, twice weekly cage cleaning PLUS four hours of freedom from the cage and interaction with you every day.<br>  <br>  Sound like hard work? Try a pair of rats! Also excellent pets and sweet, but much easier and cheaper to care for, but they still require at least two hours attention a day!|`|CKRfaRYvaa	I have two cats, and my former roommate brought home a ferret without any warning.  It was a horrible experience.  This ferret was impossible to litterbox train and he would randomly attack my cats.  If my cats were eating, he would literally throw himself in the middle of the food dish to interrupt them.  If you like your cats, do NOT get a ferret.|`|BO28Mn8haa	better to get two.<br>  <br>  you need at least a two story cage for them<br>  <br>  yes they smell, horribly. you can get them de-scented. but honestly to me they continued to smell<br>  <br>  they are sly little creatures so get ready to lose your shiny objects.|`|9WKVmOs1aa	ferretts stink really really badly. i think that they actually would be really bad with cats becuz their tempers are bad and i think the cats would eat it. im not sur eabout the harness, but what animal LIKES having something around them like that? you could get as many as you want. they would do better in pairs.
IrdZKYT3aa	No, it would be a bad idea for the guppies. <br>  Angel fish are aggressive, and known fin nippers.  The slower moving male guppy would be prey.  <br>  The shark can also be aggressive, especially as he grows larger.  He may see them as food, but would at the very least harasses them.<br>  Having the guppy's in a stressful environment, with ripped fins, can lead to them getting a diesease and potentially compromising the tank.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	No. The angels and shark may prey on them.|`|AraBfesHaa	oh boy.  With mollies, platys, guppies and swordtails, all livebearers, you're going to have tons of fish in no time.  Every month your females will give birth to up to 80+ fry, and that's EACH female, so you better get more than the tanks you have now, or you can leave the fry in the tank and hope the other fish eat them, but they probably won't eat them all, but you'll get a little population control anyway.   Then, once adolescents, the fry will begin to reproduce also.<br>  Good luck with that.|`|rSfoEyE3aa	In my aquarium i have 3 angels 1 swordtil 1 platy 1 molly and a sucker  i had a guppy and my angels ate the tail off it and then i found it chought in my filter.<br>  In my opinion guppies and angels really dont match . why dont you put your angel in the aquarium you have your guppy in and then put your guppy in the large aquarium with the other small fish thats your best bet in my opinion.<br>  <br>  HOpE I HeLpEd!!!!|`|Yztrofywaa	They should  be alright, my concern is they may get beat up by the angels if they come up to the higher levels of the tank as they (angels) can be aggressive. However that probably wont happen, they should be fine. If your rainbow shark is big they might get eaten though.|`|573Q4zCpaa	the only fish that u shouldent put in ith gupies is aquatic frogs,cat fish ,sharks, and chinese fghting fish thats just  bout it but considering u haev an albino rainbow shark and seeing how there very timid they all shoud get along GREAT!!!!!!!|`|kwnq8b2waa	the angelfish might beat them up. But only if they are large, full-grown angelfish. Also, the shark may eat them if it is big enough.

A cheap.bad skimmer will  do almost nothing, but give you a false sense of security. I strongly advise that you get the absolute best skimmer you can afford. The difference between a good and bad skimmer can be staggering. I can't give you a specific recommendation because I don't know your price range or your set up. Do your homework, and look around to see whats available.  <br>  As a rule, manufacturers grossly over estimate their skimmers rating them for almost twice the size tank than they should, so get one rated for about 100 gal..tank. You don't have to worry about over skimming.
s76aC4G8aa	She probably heard something outside and is barking saying "hey get away" mine do that, infact my Weim scared the crap outta me one night when we were staying up in the mountains, it was dark the cabin is not next to anyone and suddenly my dog stared out the window and started barking with hackles up, well needless to say it scared the bejesus out of me thinking someone was looking in the window.  It happens, just tell the dog to shut up and or kick her out.<br>  <br>  She's a dog being a dog.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	My guess would be that she heard something - maybe your mom got up to use the bathroom?  Maybe a car went by and she saw the headlights?  Maybe the house settled?  There are a lot of noises that houses make and when you are in bed it is quiet enough to hear things that you wouldn't during the day.  I wouldn't worry too much about it.  I know I get freaked out when my dog does this but I know it is nothing.  My house was built in 1900 so it has a lot of odd noises.|`|mRevWUxlaa	Has someone passed away, close to you, recently?

L22hVXTIaa	I really find it hard to believe that the vet thinks your cat is overweight at 8 lbs.!  Unless she has a very tiny body frame.  Does she appear fat to you?  If your cat looks balanced and it fit, happy and active I doubt that she's overweight.  I have two neutered male domestic short hair "road cats" - one weighs 20 lbs and one weighs 19 lbs. But they are BIG cats.  I have a third female cat who has a very light frame and she weighs 12 lbs.  So, in my opinion, I don't see how your cat can be considered fat.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	It depends on the breed/ancestry of the cat.  Siamese are typically a smaller built cat and wouldn't have the same acceptable weight as a Maine Coon.  <br>  <br>  Try putting her on a feeding schedule instead of free feeding and get her off bargain cat food if that's what you feed. You don't need wieght loss cat food, just good wholesome food.  <br>  <br>  Dry food and cheap wet food typically has alot of corn and grain fillers which are basically like feeding your cat a Little Debbie cake.  <br>  <br>  High quality foods like Wellness and Innova are made with better ingredients and contain little to no grain fillers. This means your cat won't have to eat as much to feel satisfied and to get the nutrition she needs.  This way she will naturally maintain a healthy weight for her build.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	It depends on her frame.  I have 2 large frame male cats and they average 12 pounds each, but look slim and sleek.  I also have a cat that used to weigh 22 pounds, but is now down to about 10 - the vet says they are all healthy.|`|JjbragXNaa	8 lbs is probably slightly more than what she'd weigh in the wild, but it is perfectly normal for a house cat.  I have one that weighs 7 and he's always been that way.|`|AA11364723	Just like people, it depends on her frame.  We have a 12 lb. cat and a 20 lb. cat.  Neither is overweight and both see the vet on a regular basis.|`|wqL84O8Naa	God no....<br>  6-10 lbs is healthy, some cats are naturally larger and average in at a healthy 10 - 12 lbs|`|fDOSnGpwaa	8 lbs isn't so bad, our cat is actually over that.|`|ltt2pLg5aa	9|`|AA11170074	It's hard to determine if your cat is overweight just by the breed and weight. Mostly it's determined by how the cat looks proportionally. An 8 pound cat who is very tall/long and lean looking is not overweight but a smaller build of cat at 8 pounds may show things like excessive weight past the ribs. It's also difficult to convince a cat to lose weight. Most vets have a chart posted with pictures that can help you see what a healthy weight cat is supposed to look like (I couldn't find one quickly enough to add to this answer). If your vet is rude about telling you your cat is fat, rather than concerned for her health, you may want to consider a new vet. If you determine that your cat really is overweight and you can't afford the diet cat foods you can add wet cat food to her diet in addition to the dry food. When they eat dry food exclusively they eat what they need nutritionally and are still hungry. The wet cat food will help her fill up so she doesn't east alot of extra dry food.|`|cqW523iCaa	oh! for me better give him more weights.. cats are cute when there over size.. like garfield. :D .. get more information about your cats here...|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	If she's over-weight, she's not much.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	She is over weight somethiing you can change with exercise and proper diet.|`|w1lh1INHaa	I think your vet was joking with you.  Seriously joking with you.<br>  <br>  Siamese tend to be on the slender side and are lighter weight than a lot of cats and most Siamese fanciers prefer a somewhat lean look, but a cat doesn't stop growing until they are about 3 years old (give or take, depending on breed), so it is likely she was still growing.|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	no, that is actually a good size for a cat. I would think a cat over 15 pds would be over weight but it all depends on what kind of cat it is. Male cats tend to be more heavy then female cats. If your worried she is still fat, cut back on her food through out the day. My cat eats 1 cup throughout the day. Fat cats usually end up with health issues and the way the vet bills comes to you, its a bit shocking...lol|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Maybe your vet is concerned that the cat is not getting enough exercise.

If he came from the breeder you'll need to get the stallion service certificate from the mare owner and contact Susie at the breed society about getting a late registration on him.  Unless you have correct paperwork you are not going to be able to register him - the society is no longer accepting registrations on "Highland types" of unknown breeding.  Feel free to email me if this is messing with your brain a bit!<br>  <br>  OK - go back to the breeder and ask them to register him as then he'll carry his prefix.  Only the owner of the prefix can register ponies under it - you cannot register the pony under someone else's name.  It is a lot of hassle and expense to register a prefix and to be honest I'd question whether it's worth it for one gelding.  The breeder really should be doing the registration - why wasn't it done during the pony's first year?  Obviously he won't have a passport.

AA11992723	the probiotics in yogurt isnt enough to do anything. You should buy a human grade probiotic pill like acidophilus.<br>  <br>  p.s. no I would not give that in a kong as a treat either. I stuff my dogs kongs with canned sardines packed in water, can jack mackarel in water, or wild alaskan salmon in water. they are a good source of omega3 fatty acids.<br>  <br>  ADD: i'm telling you that NO amount of yogurt will be beneficial and IMHO, NO amount is advisable (most dogs are allergic to dairy or at least very sensitive to it). Vets have VERY BASIC education about dog nutrition. you could ask any canine nutritionist if you doubt the answers you get here...<br>  <br>  antibiotics can be pills too............but if you have trouble, you simply coat the pill with a little veg. oil, tilt your dogs head back and place the pill to the back of his tongue, clamp his mouth gently shut with your hand while with the other hand, massage his throat to induce swallowing. good luck.

(although you just started yesterday, so the runs may still come)  I don't think that by freezing it or by giving him regular yogurt will make him fatter or that it'll be more unsafe.<br>  <br>  But I doubt that yogurt will build up his immunity at all.  Only a healthy diet free of toxins, that is fed over a duration of time with plenty of exercises will give your dog the best immunity.  There really is no quick fix for it.

Weight loss could have a number of underlying causes and you will likely make yourself crazy if you start looking up everything, so better to take the time and do a list of all things you have noticed about your cat (weight loss, drinking habits, kind of food, any changes in food, changes in eating habits, changes in personality, changes in litter box usage, stress issues, meowing more/less often, sleeping more/less...everything you can think of).  Don't forget to take a stool sample just in case the vet needs it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	She is young for many of the simple things like a thyroid problem, but she could have a problem with her teeth.  The vet can easily check that out, but if not, probably blood tests will be needed.<br>  <br>  One can easily list all sorts of things, but it won't really help you, and may only make you more worried. Taking her to the vet is the first step in trying to find out what is the problem.  Good luck.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Have you checked her teeth? My cat was that age when he suddenly started losing weight. Turned out he had some bad teeth that were affecting his ability to eat normally.

I have to do it with my 15 year old female.|`|afec6d005fb7698534de7994ff84613caa	My cat was 6 when she was diagnosed with kidney failure.  The signs were sudden weight loss and loss of appetite.

I really hope that it isn't!|`|nBehRANyaa	Diabetes and kidney disease are the two that come to mind.|`|DEdtNBBSaa	Hi,  Glad to hear you are going to the vet.  Her problem could be a number of things and you are going to need a vet to weed through it.  You might be interested in a pet insurance program, but be advised...there is usually a grace period before they cover tests and illnesses.  That's the bummer side not getting coverage before your cat gets sick.  Check it out though, there is one company that allows coverage for pre-existing conditions.  Pet Assure is the company and you can read a review below.
ltP1gO4taa	Absolutely not.  You should never correct a dog for anything you don't catch them in the act of doing.<br>  <br>  This is confusing and can cause the dog to fear you and become a biter.|`|AA11992723	NO they have no idea why you are mad and it CAN make the dog urinate or poop more out of fear!!!!!! (it's called Submission urination, in a dog world, a dog will urinate when they have no idea why another is angry so they urinate to try to appease you) Dogs know when you are angry because they can smell our hormones. it's not good for him or you to scold/be angry. now don't get mad at ME but who is the "bad" one, your dog for getting in the trash, or you for not properly concealing the trash and giving your dog something else to do like a Kong or chew?;)|`|FnrAw2SQaa	nope they have no idea your dog just probably thinks you lost your mind|`|CkecSp4Uaa	No.  If you are going to use ANY kind of punishment to try to correct a behavior (including scolding) then you need to deliver the punishment at the exact instant that the behavior happens.  Giving it even a few seconds late can result in the dog thinking that they are being punished for an entirely different behavior.  And giving it a few hours later only makes them think that you are a mentally unstable, randomly scary human.  They don't make the connection at all.  If you're angry at them, it's fine to send them to their crate or put them outside while you clean up the mess and take a few minutes to cool down so that they aren't underfoot, but you need to do so in as calm a manner as possible so that the dog doesn't feel threatened.  Shouting, yelling, or scolding will do nothing except cause your dog not to trust you.|`|Chxoncy7aa	No it does not do any good.  I hear people say all the time, I came home and saw trash all over the floor.  I yelled at the dog, he knew what he did.  He looked guilty, he tucked his tail and ran.  DUH!  He tucked his tail and ran because you can home and screamed at the dog.  Now the dog is afraid of you coming home.  There is a 3 second rule.  If you don't correct it within 3 seconds, you are too late.  Of course a dog will know you are mad hours later, but will not have any idea why.  Anyone who tells you different is an idiot!  Look how many people here have answered the same way already!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	No, you have to address behavior issues the second they happen.  You also have to be careful how you handle situation, or the thing you think you trained becomes the thing the puppy doesn't do.  For example if a puppy goes potty, make a sound like disgust, (ttst) and take the puppy outside to potty.  If you yell at the puppy and take it outside, you think you taught the puppy not to potty in the house, but what the puppy learned was it got yelled at and put outside, so in the puppies mind outside becomes the place he never wants to go again.|`|AA10029366	No...which is why any dog trainer worth a penny will tell you that if you didn't catch them in the act, you hit yourself on the head for not watching the dog more closely. And then you clean up the mess.<br>  <br>  Dogs live in the moment.|`|AA10648704	Some may say otherwise, but I think they do.  When our lab chews up paper (fortunately, that's all she gets into), she often does it first thing after we've left (we've made a quick trip back and found her at it), we still find her hiding in her cage or hanging her head when we get home, often before we realize what she's done (and she's normally very happy to see us).|`|AA11244754	No, all they know is that you're angry but don't understand why, just don't scold them unless you catch them in the act of doing it.|`|AA11589437	No, it is pointless. All trainers say you must catch him on the act, otherwise he doesn't understand what you are talking about.|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	I don't think you can punish them, because i don't think they remember.  They probably think you are just being mean.|`|Py9zyABGaa	no you should never disipline a dog after hours go by. They will not remember|`|Rva0ocMOaa	NO! Do NOT do that. He will not know why he is in trouble and it will just cause him to fear you.|`|fFtBqFB6aa	No, they don't remember.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Nope, does no good at all.  You are wasting your breath.|`|tHXtriPgaa	YES it does help and YES they do remember. But try to catch your dog right when they are doing to "bad thing" or instantly after. Not 6 hours later ... If you yell at the dog for no apparent reason, no, they won't remember. If you correct them rather than "yelling" at the dog, it would help. It's TRAINING the dog. It does help. Maybe if it doesn't you aren't doing it correctly. You are NOT wasting your breath. If you get corrected, are you going to forget? No!|`|MpNCNQU5aa	well my dog wen he does any of those you said like emties the trash there is evidence and wen we get home we know he did somethin wrong b.c he croutches really low and trys to hide. wen we show it to him he looks very very guilty and sad.<br>  i dont think of scolding them hours later b/c knowing they did bad like my dog belives he did bad is big enough for him. <br>  scold at the action|`|BDpQX9Q5aa	older dogs might, but not puppies. i have a poodle he's about 1 years old, he recently got into the trash while we weren't home, but when we got there we told him he was bad and got onto him a bit, and he knew exactly what we were talking about, and hasn't done it since.|`|h71XGaqgaa	NO. they do not remember wat they did i have done that in the past and i have 3 dogs and they look at me like i am crazy for yelling at them.  just call them over show them wat they did and just tell them no not yelling  but a simple no then lett them go on there way|`|fce5d52d7a2eabde37a772a4248573d1aa	well lets say your dog got into the trash and then a few hours later when hes lying in his bed maybe sleeping and you run up to him and yell at him...then he wont know what he did before and hes going to think your yelling at him for lying in his bed.....|`|3d9rSmc1aa	no. you absolutely have to catch the dog in the act because something he did 2 mins ago is out of his mind and he's thinking about something else. scolding him now will only confuse him.|`|vLmgRAvNaa	It depends. A dog learns best with positive reinforcement. The dog probably will not remember after that many hours.|`|kAA0N5RCaa	No.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Is it ok to say no one more time?
lNzhglLFaa	i would consult a vet before using baby shampoo on them... however they do make ferret shampoos(witch i think would be fine)  or rat shampoos that they should sell at Petco.<br>  <br>  one more thing... i would be careful about over bathing them too... it really dries out the skin and can make them itchy.<br>  <br>  enjoy your new pets!<br>  <br>  p.s. they also like playing in the tub with just 2-3 inches of water in the bottom of it :)|`|qBoArmRaaa	I've used that in the past, but now I've switched to puppy shampoo. It smells better and lasts longer. Be careful though! My rats do not like bath time so either trim their nails beforehand or wear long sleeves as they will try to climb up your arms! :P<br>  Good luck!|`|CZsjZCzVaa	I think a tiny amount of baby shampoo or maybe something hypo allergenic would be good.|`|hGGcSBaiaa	you DONT bath rats they clean themselves and can get wet tail and so on|`|nMuDw3Nzaa	Perfectly fine!<br>  By the way, you will get used to the tickle. I did within a week, and it is so fun to put them on other people's shoulders and watch them squirm, unable to walk around because the ratty is tickling them!<br>  <br>  I bathe my rats with baby shampoo.  Hypo allergenic is best, and nothing smelling to strong. Cat shampoo can work too, but no anti-flea stuff.  and don't get water in their eyes, and just fill an area with warm water (slightly warmer than you would think--rats have higher body temperatures) and let the water fill until it goes above your hand slightly if you lay it flat. Don't put them under running water or they will get scared even more. They are likely to scratch you trying to climb up your arm and hide on the back of your neck. They hate it, but dry them up good and give them treats and they will love you soon.<br>  <br>  If you have any more rat questions, you can email me at lynxlover623@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  I have learned lots about rats and I can help you in anyway possible, mostly.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Baby shampoo should be fine.  You don't need a lot.  Since they are new to you and their environment I would suggest not to bath right now.  Give them a couple of weeks to get used to everything.  Rats can become stressed quite easily and you have lots of time.  Check site below that has good info and links on rats.  Lots of good info.  Learn all you can about your new pets.
Hwybmzg5aa	one acre per cow|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Where I live it is required to have one acre per large animal (in your case 1 acre per cow/bull/calf). Most prefer 2 acres at least per animal.
XI2iylR4aa	I think it's great that your planning to neuter your rabbits.  I am kind of surprised that the breeder said that it's best to keep your female intact.  Females have a very high rate of uterine cancer, so getting her spayed will likely increase her life expectancy by a few years.  I think getting a pair would be good, as long as the rabbits get along.  Rabbits do need a lot of attention, and if you don't have hours a day to spend with the rabbit, having a pair can keep everybody happier.<br>  <br>  As for neutering, I think rabbits can be neutered about about four months or older.  There are always exceptions that go in either direction, but the best person to ask is your rabbit-savvy vet.  If you don't have a vet yet, here's a good site to find a recommended vet:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rabbit.org/vets/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://rabbit.org/vets/index.html</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hQQuqyYcaa	If you're able to get a bonded pair, then that's great! Get two :D Yes, you can neuter/spay before sexual maturity. Make sure you find a vet who is highly knowledgable in rabbits. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to a vet who "knows" rabbits, yet he/she doesn't even know how to hold one correctly. <br>  It's best to get rabbits in pairs because they are social creatures. If you feel that you won't have time to give one hours of attention each day, then get two to keep each other company.|`|0QIDzCL9aa	i've got 2 neutered males living together (they're brothers).  <br>  <br>  you can get either 2 males or 2 females if they have been together when they are young.  but you have to have them neutered.|`|gkgPHzg4aa	If you think that you can take care of them, sure why not get them.
u7vrul2Faa	Is your cat an oriental breed eg a Siamese cat? They tend to be very vocal and crave so much attention, they are more likely to get depressed easily and develop behavioural problems like you describe if they are not fussed over enough and they hate being alone.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Getting her fixed would probably fix the problem. At the very least, you should take her in for the vet to have a look-see at her. Would you get rid of your child if it cried all the time? There's usually a reason, she's trying to tell you something. It's your job as a reponsible pet owner to figure out what she's trying to tell you!|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	cage ? you keep her in a cage ? that will cause howling.<br>  <br>  get her spayed. if a cat goes into season, but does not get any, she goes in again very soon. she probably just wants son me, really, really bad.|`|aIyvWIJlaa	Your first step should be to consult your vet, in case the poor creature is ill and in pain.|`|pDv13gJwaa	get the f'n thing fixed|`|6beL9zycaa	Why haven't you taken her to the vet?  You have an animal that you are responsible for!  For starters, you should have her spayed...that's a no brainer with all of the homeless animals running around having litters & the hundreds of thousands of animals that are destroyed annually because people do not care for their animals & take responsibility to have them spayed & neutered!  Trust me, I know how something like this can drive you up the wall...I've been there) but common sense dictates the following:  1.  Visit to the vet.  2. Have her spayed (she will not only be a lot happier, she will be a LOT healthier over her lifetime...which will be longer as a result.)  Animals are very much like humans in many ways~ if they're carrying on about something, they're unhappy about something that's going on with them.  They're either in pain, hungry, or in heat.  Do you have kids?  You do now.  Take her to the vet & have her spayed, & see what the vet thinks.<br>  Good luck, I don't mean to sound "harsh" but geeze...<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Ok, I understand the situation better since you edited your question.  I had a cat like that once, & I do feel your pain.  She was so neurotic she would fling herself up against the screen door & crawl inbetween the sliding glass door & the screen (are you getting the visual?)  And scream.  So I do know what you're going through.  We named her "Sybil" because she was so crazy.  Didn't the vet suggest having her spayed? That helped Sybil a lot, but she was just one of "those cats".  It's like I said~ people have GOT to spay & neuter their animals so that litter after litter of kittens & puppies aren't ending up in shelters that are already too full to find homes for them all.  (Please give her a chance... have her spayed, if she doesn't mellow out you can go from there.) There are alot of spay/neuter clinics that will give you a break financially, especially if you tell them she is a rescue cat. Not sure where you got her from, was she a stray?  Start by calling your humane society & animal control agency.  Anyway, I wish you luck, I know it's hard to deal with, I really do.  But you've got a handful there & I'm going to commend you on hanging in there as long as you have.  Have her spayed... it will help a lot.  Good luck.|`|hJHJyUWPaa	may be a stupid question, but have you brought her to the Vet?!<br>  Our cat was like this for a few weeks, wouldnt let anyone touch him, turned out to be tooth decay so he was in pain, and pretty hungry as he wasnt eating properly.|`|4829bd5fbd1429ebdcc2c97ad76e466aaa	MAYBE YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT TAKE HER OR HIM TO THE VET AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY SHE MAY BE IN MAJOR PAIN FROM SOMETHING YOU CANT SEE.

GIVE HER TIME DONT GIVE HER UP SO FAST.|`|yldVFIcXaa	Kev is one sick ****, and so is your wife if she suggested that without being very obviously joking.<br>  <br>  Also, you need to answer the question - has she been spayed.|`|8b121abc6d8f173686d4a48325fd8dbdaa	Probably she's in heat.. My cats did the same thing and as soon as we took them to the vet to get them neutered they stop. Good luck|`|bqkfu6Diaa	get the cat fixed. it calms them down|`|ldElfsOCaa	Is she fixed? If not..l.do that|`|DtkLsetkaa	A) Let her out of the cage, unless you mean like an open crate?  But never cage your pet up, that's cruel<br>  B) Go get her spayed.  She will not only be happier, but healthier.  <br>  C) Vet!  Beyond all this, there could be something very wrong.  Describe all this when you call to make the appointment to get her fixed.
RT8LZy7gaa	If there's no redness and it's just occasional wetness in the corners of the eyes, there's probably nothing wrong.  It could be something in the room that irritates her eyes now and again (air freshner, cooking odors, dust, etc.)  The vet will check her eyes to be sure on her visit, but for now just gently wipe away any wetness you notice.  Now, if it's yellowish or she won't open her eyes all the way, or she rubs her face alot, that would be different.<br>  <br>  You can expect at least an office visit charge ($40 or so) and she'll probably need a rabies and distemper vaccination ($20-30 a piece?) if she's not current.  Since she's an indoor only cat I wouldn't worry about vaccinating against feline leukemia, unless you intend to add another cat at some point.  Also, try to take her to the same vet she's already seen so they will have her vaccination history.  If not, try to get a print out for the new vet so they can tell when she was last vaccinated.  You're probably looking at anywhere from $50 to $100 or so for the visit.  But the good news is it's probably a once a year thing. THey don't normally do bloodwork during a regular check up.  They may want to check for worms, but that's probably unnecessary as well. If she's been indoors and didn't have worms at her last check up, she won't get them from anything in the house.|`|ad3b5cd523444e3461eb988f6ede1f97aa	my cat had the same thing and when there is a runny type teary thing in the eyes going on that can be an infection or an allergy, y vet gave my cat anti boitics , and said they can take child benadryl but my cat wont take it ,ask them first before giving benabryl to your cat , also what really helped him to was ecchineca drops ,|`|LB3Rgpioaa	Sounds like conjunctivitis, they'll give you eye drops at the vet.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Some breeds like Persians and Himalayans have naturally runny eyes.  Since the fluid is clear, it could be allergies.  My cat has allergies and his eyes will tear when he has a flare-up.  Infection is usually green or yellowish discharge from the eyes.  Whatever the issue, your vet will hook you up with the right treatment to get your kitty well again.<br>  <br>  A check up at my vet is $35.  The vet will check her ears, eyes, weigh her, check her teeth, and just take a good overall look at her.  If she hasn't been tested for FIV/FeLV and the vet thinks it's a good idea he may do the test.  It costs $40 at my vet.  Shots for my cats cost $21. Prices vary with vets in different parts of the country so my vet's pricing may be higher or lower than yours.<br>  <br>  Hint:  If your cat does have allergies, running an air purifier will help alot.|`|r1OQi2Lhaa	Sounds like conjunctivitis, but my cat usually has a few crusty bits in the corners of her eyes (they're a bit like us really with sleep in their eyes). <br>  In terms of taking her to the vet they usually check out their ears, eyes, lungs, and feel them for lumps, bumps, etc, and she'll be weighed, that's the general check-up. If it's been a while she'll probably be due vaccinations, which increases the vet bill, whether or not she's allowed out will depend on the vaccinations needed. It usually costs me about ￡34 when I take mine for her vaccinations, getting claws trimmed less than ￡3, it just really depends on what's done.<br>  Good luck with your first vet appointment, I'm sure you and your cat will both be fine :)|`|4TX26viFaa	It's usually either the calci virus or the herpes virus.  The vet can check.  If it's the calci you'll need a prescritpion ointment to clear it up. But if it's the herpes you can use a home remedy that works quickly.<br>  <br>  FIV cats often get runny eyes due to the herpes virus. Lysine (also called L-lysine) is an amino acid that bonds to the virus and negates the effects, you can get lysine from the vitamin section of the grocery store for something like 60 pills for $5 with generic brands.  A cat dose is 250 to 500mg a day. You crush the pill and put it over their food (it's tasteless).  No side effects other than possibly constipation (which we never saw in our cats). You can't overdose on it, as the cat's body excretes what it can't use.  And it won't interfere with other medications either.  <br>  <br>  We see improvement in 3 days but treat for 5 to 7 days to really clear it up.  Ask the vet about it, it's a common holistic medicine that works quickly.  It even works on human cold sores (same virus).  Don't use the gel caps with the cats, the taste is terrible.  Stick with the pills, and crush them with the back of a spoon.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Could be a number of things, such as a flare up of a herpes infection, that is easily treated.<br>  <br>  If your cat hasn't been for a long time, she may be overdue for vaccinations, but I don't know that.  <br>  <br>  If she is indoors only, a fecal test often is not needed, especially if she does not have fleas and was previously tested.<br>  <br>  The vet will do a general appraisal of her health, check her teeth, ears, heart rate, etc.  My guess, and it is only a guess, since costs vary even within a small region, is around $100, since shots and some tests may be needed.

hC4Z8HIbaa	Baytril is most typically an oral antibiotic. I'm not saying that the vet wasn't right in giving the baytril as an injection, but I've never heard of it being done. I would suggest not going back to that vet. Unfortunately, most vets only cater their services to cats and dogs. I suggest calling to local clinics and ask if they have a vet familiar with rats in their staff. If a vet does not know the proper way to care for a rat, it could be dangerous to the rat. And just because he is a vet doesn't mean he knows everything about every animal. Have you heard this joke before? What do they call the guy who graduates last in medical school? They call him Doctor. Which means just because they have a liscence doesn't mean they actually know what they're doing 100% of the time.<br>  <br>  I suggest re-asking this question on the forum I've listed below. It is a rat community I am a member of. The people there have owned rats for a very long time and are very familiar with the common practices used by rat-familiar vets. They may know some reason as to why the vet decided to do a baytril injection rather than an oral dose or if it is even proper to give baytril as an injection, and if it isn't if it could cause any harm to your rat.|`|UrfIXYdwaa	The reason it's not advisable to inject baytril is due to the possibility of what's known as 'baytril burn' occurring.  Some rats have a bad reaction if the baytril comes into contact with skin which can sometimes happen during the injection (the baytril causes tissue damage!).<br>  <br>  Keep a close eye on your rat over the next couple of days and check the area that was injected well to ensure no scabs, ulcers, etc are forming.  If you do notice any change, take the rat straight back to the vet to be treated immediately, baytril burn is very painful for the rat.  <br>  <br>  In most other animals, the vet would be quite correct in administering the first dose of baytril by injection, but it's an unfortunate fact that most vets are not educated enough about rats to understand that rats are not usually good subjects for injections.<br>  <br>  Hopefully your rat will be fine and will show no effects from the injection xxx  Live and learn from the experience and, now you know, make sure you always tell the vet 'no' if they offer an injection of baytril, never be afraid to advise your vet if you know better :-D|`|ZuFVHsRpaa	The Baytril helps with respiratory problems so maybe the vet was right go to my source site it can give you more information than I can.|`|l8gUwy2daa	It is ok.

You will find all the correct info there. If you do not see what you need send us an email.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	His weight depends on how big his bone structure is. If you cannot feel ribs with your fingers pressed lightly against his side, then it's likely that he's a bit overweight. It's best to limit his food to 1/4 cup per day, but make sure he has a constant supply of Timothy hay. He should also be getting fresh greens/veggies/small amount of fruit each day (about 1 cup). Also, how many treats is he getting per day? If he's getting several throughout the day, it's best to cut those down.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	For showing, adults should not be over 4 lbs. Juniors can be 2 lbs.<br>   There is no range for pet Holland Lops.  Just because yours is heavier, doesn't mean it is fat-it could just be big for the breed. That isn't really a bad thing for a pet, its just not good for showing or breeding.<br>  At a year, you should limits his food.  a 1/4 cup of pellets/ rabbit food is about right. Go easy with the greens, they can give him the runs.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Holland lops,known as Dwarf Lops in the UK weigh no more than 2.5kgs,ideally no more than 5lbs,mine are no more than 4 1/2lbs. Yes you should limit his food,over 6 months old Dwarf/Holland lops are classed as adults,his pellets should be restricted to 1/4 a cup(50-60gms/2ozs) per day,that what my Dwarf Lops get. :) Its possible he could just be slightly over weigh,or just the way he is,is his skin baggy? Or is he well cover,but firmly fleshed? I feed my rabbits greens 1-2x a week,since as long as their dry feed is well balanced,they do not need greens for a source of vitamins & minerals. Quite a few breeders do not feed greens more than 2 a week. However, this does not mean you cannot give plenty of greens,up to 4 ounces(4ozs) is suitable,mine like parsley,kale & lambs lettuce,Ice berg isn't advisable,since it has a substance in it which a sedative & has practically NO nutritional value. Aww,yes mine like banana! :D<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,xxx

YUQgyPT3aa	I prefer the HALTI... I had the most wonderful results with my Pit...harnesses encourage pulling|`|GSf09ALBaa	Okay, I tried it for my Pit.  It didn't work too well.  I just didn't like it.<br>  Then I tried a prong collar.  Forget it.  Then a Halti collar.  Now, that works.  Your dog will hate it, try and remove it the first few times, but it will stop the pulling.<br>  <br>  The only thing I don't like about it is it is so restrictive.  But, when they are first learning it is fine.<br>  <br>  ADD:  Get the Halti that attaches to your dog's collar.  So if he slips the Halti, you still have your dog.|`|3YMETqStaa	This is a funny question because the Illusion Collar was invented by Ceasar Millan and he talked about walking with a harness in an episode of Dog Whisperer.  The owner tried a few different harnesses to help the dog at the heal position but Ceasar pointed out that harnesses are designed for the dog to pull without putting a strain on the neck and are just for weight pulling.  So by using a harness youre actually giving her more power to pull.  Use a simple collar/leash or even a chain choke chain to train your dog.  If she starts to pull you need to tug the leash and say "heal" or whatever command you want then have a loose leash.  If she pulls again same thing.  If she is not responding tug the leash and say "let's go" and walk the other way.  It can take a while but you need to be assertive and consistent.  The mind set you need to have while walking is I'm going to go for a walk and do what I want, I'm simply inviting my dog to join me.  Do not let her think she is controlling how fast to walk or where to walk.  I have to credit this all to Ceasar Millan and Dog Whisperer but I have been training my 9 year old Jack Russel mix to walk at the heal position for 3 weeks now and she is almost perfect every time.|`|8accb9ae01507e9d4e1ed55a7caec396aa	The only thing that will work to stop your dog from pulling is TRAINING. A prong collar will aid in teaching your dog not to pull, just make sure it is fitted correctly. You and your dog would benefit from obedience classes.<br>  <br>  Edit: I have seen too many dogs escape the hailti to believe it works or is safe.|`|Rrpb5aLMaa	Try a no pull harness works wonders  or a gentle leader|`|rpVQpJA7aa	It didn't work for my dog!

hQQuqyYcaa	I currently have 4 tree frogs, myself. You can keep them as pets. Expense depends on which tree frogs you're getting. Please do you research on the tree frogs before buying. I would not recommend red-eyed tree frogs for a beginner. Try starting out with green, gold, or white's "dumpy" tree frogs. It's best to get a 20 gallon tall tank and keep them in pairs or small groups. They need daily misting to keep the humidity up. I would recommend Bed-a-Beast for the substrate, as well as an under-the-tank heater rather than a basking bulb (which can actually dry out the frogs). They require UVB light (even though they are nocturnal creatures). They eat live crickets or mealworms (crickets most often) that need to be dusted with a calcium powder. With their water, make sure that they have a dish deep enough for them to sit in, but not too deep to where they can't put their front feet on the bottom and still have their eyes on top of the water. They also require a water conditioner (Reptisafe is good) to get rid of the chlorine in tap water. All in all, the initial set up can run up to $100. Monthly supplies are the crickets/mealworms and bedding...every now and then you'd have to get more reptisafe and calcium dust.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	yes, it depends $3-80 depending on what species you get. you're welcome.|`|lNzhglLFaa	yes you can keep them as pets...<br>  green tree frogs are common pets.. <br>  at my store they are $9.99  <br>  they do need UVB lighting witch runs about $50  <br>  they can live in a ten gallon tank (about $25 with a screen cover) <br>  a heat mat ($15-$20)<br>  and decos (water dish, plants, background,etc) <br>  <br>  you cant handle them.. but they are fun to watch and listen to!|`|nObgLVkraa	Yes but only some kinds.

Never feed a large dog just once a day.|`|s76aC4G8aa	Look on the bag of food to determine how many cups per body weight.  I would feed him two meals a day.

Each feeding should be 1 1/2 cups. You can give the dog treats during the day but not to much. (it'll get fat)|`|v6Xmzno7aa	How much you feed him is something I leave to my Vet.  I do always check the dog food bag to see the recommended amount. The guidelines are a good start point. It  always says each dog is different.  Some require less or more.  My dog  is 49lbs and gains weight easily (also a couch potato) so 2 cups a day is what works well for her. One way of knowing if he's getting too much to eat is by having him weighed periodically at the Vet's.  The Vet will let you know if he's too fat.  <br>  One thing I learned from my Vet is feeding them twice a day is better then giving them the whole big amount at once.  It digests better and they have another meal to look forward to.  They don't have to wait 24 hours either.  When you feed him is up to you but get him into a routine cuz it also helps them with their toilet habits.  Remember they are creatures of habit.   Mine is fed around 8am and 5pm and I don't need an alarm clock to tell me cuz she's already letting me know by sitting and staring at me.  They are quite into routine.  If you feed them randomly then they never have a set time and it can deter their potty training too.  Good luck and it's always good to check with your vet.  Since he's such a large dog, you may want to cut back on the treats and give him raw veggies or apples for his treat.  Mine gets a mini carrot or apple mostly.  This helps her maintain her girlish figure and the crunch of the carrot may even help with the gums and teeth.  Not  sure though but it is better then cookies which are empty calories.|`|c8XTy3Zpaa	Hey Ian,<br>  The answer is .... It depends...Huskys are very powerful and athletic.  They are work dogs.  This means that they need fuel.  We feed ours 3 cups of food a day half in the morning and half at night.   If you live in a smaller house and he doesnt get out to RUN everyday you would want to feed him alot less.  This is because he won't burn the food and will have alot of extra energy as well as putting on excess weight. <br>  <br>  As for the type of food.  Make sure it does not have any bi-products in it.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|u0yHUazKaa	Feeding how much depends on quality of food, how active the dog is ect.

If it was there would be many less homeless pets out there.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is convince your parents that you know what it costs to take care of a dog for 15+ years, convince them you will walk it every day, pick up it's poop, feed it, potty train it, teach it to sit, stay, come, down, and socialize it, and for more than the 3 months that it takes it to stop being so "cute" and more of a "chore".<br>  <br>  If you can convince your parents that you know what you're asking for, you may have a shot. If not, it's better to let someone else give the puppy a home.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, your parents may have reasons of their OWN for not getting a dog now.  The economy sucks, jobs are going down the tubes and a puppy is another mouth to feed.  Do your parents rent or own their own house. If they rent, the landlord may not allow dogs.<br>  <br>  Think about it ALL before continuing to beg.|`|mRevWUxlaa	I agree with happy2lu. Im a mom and I have rules. Everyone knows that the kids want the puppy but the mom ends up taking care of it. Respect their rules and when you grow up and have your own place, get your puppy, they arent fun all the time. They are WORK most of the time. And a 15 year commitment, atleast!!! Not to mention all the cost of food, vet care, including immunizations which, might I add, are VITAL!!!

XAsR6uPvaa	I have a big tank thats normally stocked.<br>  I also have a small 10gal tank with one Ryukin and a small Black Moor. Inside this tank i also have 5 apple snails.<br>  <br>  They live normally, they show NO aggression at all, and they have NEVER to this day, gotten sick.<br>  <br>  Your goldfish isnt that big. Im sure if the temp remains at 75 then you can probably fit in a Kissing Gourami.<br>  <br>  Although i wont promise that it will get as big as they should do to being in a small space, but while they are small, it should be fine.<br>  However, some gourami's do tend to get rather aggressive and they do start to "kiss" other fish which does stress the other fish out.<br>  <br>  Good luck~<br>  And to give you some credit, congrats on having kept a goldfish alive for over a year in a 1gal tank. Im sure you can handle a 10gal and your goldfish is most likely happier to have more room to swim around.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  To the other people who are like: "get him a mansion"<br>  Seriously, mind your own business?<br>  Its an improvement from 1gal to 10gals.<br>  Not everyone in the effing world can or will waste $100+ on some massive tank for 1 freaking little goldfish.<br>  <br>  @Elizabeth~<br>  He has the fish already, too late.<br>  i was stuck with like 5 commets once due to no1 wanting to take the school fish from my bio class during winter break and i kept them in a 10gal for nearly 2 months.<br>  <br>  However, there is nothing he can do once hes had the fish for a year. Its like me asking you to give away your dog after you've had it for some time.<br>  <br>  Its small anyways.<br>  At least he got it a bigger tank.<br>  And be honest with yourself here, <br>  How many fish make it past 10 years life?<br>  How many people can afford to buy a massive tank for 1 fish?<br>  Whats the % of goldfish that die from all that are bought?<br>  How many of them actually reach 1ft length?<br>  <br>  Learn to be realistic, please~<br>  The world isnt perfect, never has been, never will.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Pink kisser??? Do you mean a kissing Gourami? <br>  <br>  They get really big like 10" and are aggressive they do not do well in community tanks.  And should not be kept with gold fish. Sorry goldfish need to live with other gold fish.  And you are going to need a bigger thank then 10 Gal for your one fish.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	He should be about six inches by this time; he is probably stunted. He should have at least a 55 gallon aquarium, with double the filtration, and no aquarium heater. They are cold water fish.<br>  <br>  Pink kissing gouramis should never be housed with goldfish. They are tropical, semi-aggressive, and require 55 gallons minimum.<br>  <br>  The ten gallon is overstocked with the one goldfish. I do not recommend adding anything else to the tank.<br>  <br>  ~The one gallon bowl stunted his growth and not even a ten gallon will allow him to reach potential. If a fish cannot grow then they cannot be healthy. Twenty is the minimum for a juvenile goldfish.<br>  ~The higher temperature may shorten his lifespan.<br>  ~Fish can live in poor living conditions for years. It doesn't mean they should.<br>  <br>  ~Vin~ "One freaking little goldfish" should grow at least one foot long, sometimes larger, and live for a minimum of 20 years for someone to think they did a good job caring for them. <br>  If you don't have the money to care for an animal correctly, than you should wait until you do. How is buying what your pet needs "wasting" money?<br>  <br>  ~Vin~ Lets analyze what you wrote:<br>  1. "And be honest with yourself here, How many fish make it past 10 years life?"- Those that are taken care of do. I have over 40 goldfish, all are at least a foot long, and 13 years old. If they all died tomorrow I would say they died young. I'm sorry for you and your fish that you have such low expectations for them.<br>  <br>  2. "Its small anyways."- As I stated above, it shouldn't be. A common goldfish should have attained about six inches by the time they are a year old. Becasue the fish is only two inches, it has stunted. Stunting causes a shortened lifespan, it means that the fish has ceased growing, but the organs have continued.<br>  <br>  3. "Whats the % of goldfish that die from all that are bought?"- Technically all that are bought die eventually, but I'm sure many die prematurely because people don't know how to take care of them.<br>  <br>  4. "Its like me asking you to give away your dog after you've had it for some time."- Nowhere did I ask her to get rid of the fish. I only asked that she give it the best environment.<br>  <br>  5. "Learn to be realistic"- I am realistic and optimistic that people can do what is right by the animals in their care.|`|KhjpmxGeaa	You can't put any other fish but his one kind,He will kill all of them and most likely eat them,I had about 4 goldfish in a 20 gallon tank and I put a betta And about 4 guppies in their and they died four days later,The only fish besides another gold fish is a sucker fish or algae eater.And you might want to change the degrees in your tank because goldfish are cold blooded.
TbdQPxptaa	Try Nutro lamb and rice small bites. You can get it at Petco and PetSmart. Don't feed your dog too much bacon grease, it will make them sick. Try the food I referenced above and if your dog will not eat it alone, sprinkle a little parmesean cheese on top. It is lowfat and they go crazy for it.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	First, has he seen a vet yet to make sure that he is healthy? After that try to soften the food with a little water.|`|AA10973353	First off, you need to quit putting bacon grease on it, it's not good for him.  Secondly, you need to stick to one kind of food, if you keep switching it, you're gonna upset his stomach and he won't eat anything, or will have runny stools or throw up.  a dog's natural instinct, he won't let himself starve, offer food to him 3-4 times a day.  If he doesn't eat, take it up and try again later.  If you want to add flavor to it, you can add a couple drops of chicken broth.  Or, if you think he has a irritated stomach or bowls, you can give him cooked white rice and boil boneless skinless chicken breasts and give him a small amount of the chicken and rice mixture.  Should only feed him this for 24 hours, the work back into dog food. If it doesn't get better in a day or 2, you need to get him to a vet.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Go to dogfoodanalysys and pick a good food. This is a puppy? Try Innova EVO for puppies. I think a grain free food is best for all dogs. Please don't put grease on the food. Bacon is too salty and too much fat can cause pancreatitis, a very serious and painful condition.<br>  <br>  If you are feeding dry food try soaking with a little chicken broth or warm water.
XI2iylR4aa	Unfortunately, it's hard to avoid.  So many of the products that people use, from medication to cosmetics to household cleaners, are tested on animals.<br>  <br>  I always try to buy products that aren't tested on animals.  If there is a non-animal tested alternative, I will choose it.|`|xzDRgxifaa	No way! why would anyone want to do that.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Depends on the product. If it says "Not tested on animals" on the side, it means that the company itself didn't test it. Unfortunately, every chemical there is out there gets tested on animals. Meaning that if it says "not tested on animals" it's wrong...it was tested on animals previously, possibly even 20 years ago, yet that company is using chemicals/substances that have already been tested, so they don't have to test it themselves. Hard to truely explain, but all in all, there is no such thing as "not tested on animals".

Just leave the eggs, and dont let anyone touch them. Some think it is a myth that if you touch the eggs, the mother wont care for them. But its better safe than sorry. If she isnt back within 5 hours or so, she might not be coming back. If this happens I would call your local wildlife rehabilitation center and see what they suggest. They will be able to take them in, hatch, and care for the ducklings, or they will know someone who could. Good luck!|`|eiVWEW3aaa	Hmm, I wouldn't touch them, but if it's pretty cold out, you have to take them in... You could get an incubator and then raise them by hand if you want...
AM7CgQ4daa	The following dogs are considered low dander allergy coated dogs, not all are large, but thought you may want the list:<br>  Bedlington Terrier<br>  Bichon Frise<br>  Irish Water Spaniel<br>  Kerry Blue Terrier<br>  Maltese<br>  Poodles<br>  Portuguese Water Dog<br>  Schnauzers<br>  Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier<br>  <br>  If this is because of allergies, beware that you can be allergic to several things, dog dander, dog saliva or even dog urine it is best to visit breeders homes and check your reactions first.<br>  Visit the breeder's home and tell the breeder about your allergies. Hug and kiss the dogs, rub your nose into their fur, and breath the air in the room where they live. Let the dogs lick your bare skin, especially on your neck (if you are brave) and inside your arms where the skin is more sensitive. You want to test your allergic reaction both to the dander and saliva. This will help you to evaluate your current allergic reaction to that particular breed.<br>  The below website is wonderful and goes into great detail<br>  <br>  Edit:   I just found this website when looking up something else,  half way down the page is a section on low shedding dogs.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moult</a>|`|Bw18seFqaa	nope.<br>  <br>  actually "Non-shedding" means hairless..  all dogs with hair shed some.<br>  <br>  <br>  You shouldnt choose a breed based on appearance.. you should choose a breed that best fits your personality and lifestyle.|`|I74O8wo1aa	Beware the poodle mixes - some shed ALOT! I have a standard poodle and a first generation poodle/lab cross. The cross makes dust bunnies that could take over the world. The poodle does not leave fur around unless the groomer forgets to blow the clipped fluff off him before he comes home. If a dogs does not shed around the house most likely the fur falling out is getting caught in their curls and needs to brushed frequently. You have a choice of a home maintenance issue or a grooming issue. Either way if you have a dog, you have fur to deal with one way or another.<br>  Lab/Poodle crosses with 3/4 poodle are much less likely to leave fur around as their hair is usually curlier. Theu look more like poodles as a general rule. a Golden Retriever/Poodle cross can be a lovely dog but they a a lot of fur to brush and I suspect shed just as much as my Cindy Lou does.|`|ac92f82f4d5b3f3af2d01d0117d482cbaa	Goldens and German Shepherds are double coated breeds.

AA10250354	You first need to go to <a href="http://dogbreedinfo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dogbreedinfo.com/</a> and do research on any potential breed that appeals to you - this site is wonderful and will list everything from grooming needs to exercise needs.<br>  <br>  Please don't buy from a pet store, go to your local shelter/rescue and save a life (many shelters can also help you find the right pet to fit your lifestyle etc).  You might even get lucky and find one that has already been trained if you go through a shelter!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ucr4J8kcaa	Why does your cousin hate her dog? Golden retrievers are great companions, and really any dog will do if you are willing to put the time and effort into training. Any dog can be a "bad dog" if you do not devote time to training. Make sure you have the time to give the dog the attention and exercise he/she deserves.If you are not prepared for it, don't get a dog.<br>  <br>  I'd say go for a rescue dog. You are saving a life and getting a great companion. Check out your local shelters and humane society. To me, breed is unimportant. As long as you socialize the dog properly it will be a great dog.

A dog that is 5-7 years old will be mellowed out and wont require as much as a younger adult or puppy.|`|AA11244754	then you must not want a large dog that badly then.  All large breed dogs are going to require lots of exercise and if you don't believe me then I suggest very strongly that you research this fact.  Also don't close your mind to goldens just because your cousin doesn't like having one.  Don't listen to her about that breed, but you need to research large breed dogs and find out which breed or mixed breed suits you best and if you don't exercise the dog like you need to then you will have problems with inappropriate behavior.  Sometimes you have to do thinks you don't want to do in order to have what you want.  LIke you probably didn't want to studyfor really long hours to learn what you wanted to so that you could have a career but you did it.  Dogs are huge responsibilities and if you aren't willing to invest the time it takes to care for the dog properly (such as exercising the a large dog for about 2 hours a day) then you will have a dog that is out of control.  Try watching Animal Planet's "It's Me Or The Dog" sometime and you will see that when ever she has to deal with an out of control large dog she tells the owners to exercise the dog for 2 hours a day.

I went into a Dog Therapy training period once and in the back in the crate area, I went into that area a couple of seconds too soon and this training person had this one dog out, well, he sorta lunged at me,  I just stood straight, looked straight ahead, made an X  with my arms on my chest and he said "where did you know that from?!"  I went "it just came out"  and he goes "that's the best thing you could've done."  "It showed no fear and that you owned the space."  It was just instinct.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure you can be great friends with the dogs but don't go overboard showing them affection.  That's not the first message you want to send them.  If that boy can't control his dogs when you're around,  he has sinister issues and is reckless with your feelings. Do you really want to be around somebody who doesn't consider your feelings first over a couple of dogs?  Think about that.   I'm sure you'll make the right decision.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Meet your fear head on with his help.  No reason to be miserable.  Big dogs are wonderful.|`|3YMETqStaa	You need to be open and honest with your boyfriend first of all.  Tell him about your fear and that you want to fix it.  It can actually be a bonding experience.  After that you have to face your fears.  I would suggest asking your boyfriend to take his dogs on a long walk and meet you at a park then you can meet them when theyre tired and walk with them home.|`|LWEceVT4aa	Tell him that you are afraid and ask him to help you get used to being around big dogs. You and him could take them for regular walks, this will surely get them on your side as dog's love to go for walks. And if you walk with them they will see you as part of the pack. Many people are afraid of dogs its not abnormal or anything, but I would suggest that you face your fears... And maybe one day you will even own a dog. Big dogs are great they are very loving, and I would even say much more gentle then smaller dogs.|`|AA11244754	Just look at it as a chance to conquer your phobia and be upfront with him about your phobia of large dogs and if he really likes you then he will be more than willing to help you face and defeat it.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	well just think of this its more common for a little dog to bit than a big dog. but do not meet them until your ready dogs can Sense your fear and that can make them bit you if they are aggressive dogs if they are not aggressive than you will be fine|`|HJ3mGLGGaa	do you have reason to be?<br>  <br>  if they jump up on you, simply cross your arms and turn away from them. if they bark at you, have him put them in another room. <br>  <br>  play with them, feed them, praise them, <br>  this will help you form a relationship with them and they will trust having you around the house|`|teDI6RQ8aa	Spend time with the dogs to get over your phobia.<br>  <br>  For me, any man I was going to date or marry had to love dogs, as dogs would be a part of my life.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Tell him!

J6IA3tmsaa	You can put a pair of zebra danios, a pair of any tetra or a betta.provided that you change the water once every two days(25% of the water)|`|kLD1AbiPaa	a 2 gallon tank is way too small for even 1 goldfish. They should have at the bare minimum a 10gallon tank. The company that sold you the tank probably knows very little about fish. They just know that people like the idea of having a small tank, because larger ones take up too much space..   and Pet stores are allowed to sell pretty much anything, most people dont condiser fish as animals, so alot of the animal rights things dont apply to them,  So petstores sell tiny tanks, with lots of fish.. because they know that if someone buys 5 fish.. and 3 of them die, odds are they will come back and buy 3 more. they dont care about the fish. they just care about making money.   <br>     Altho your fish may look 'comfortable' odds are they are not. they are prolly very stressed out, and stressed fish are much more likely to get sick or die.  Have you ever tested the water in your tank? you can take a sample of your water to a fish store and they should test it for you, or you could buy a little kit and test it yourself. your ammonia (among other things) is prolly pretty high, ammonia is what fish waste turns into when its left in the tank.. ammonia is like bleach to fish.. could you imagine living in a small closest full of you own waste and bleach? how many more people would you like in this closet with you?|`|DU7iO8EHaa	One Betta|`|HZtzPXj4aa	None get a betta|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	One Betta, just about. But they'd prefer 5 gallons or larger.<br>  <br>  A 2 gallon is TINY. Not only does it provide no swimming room but also such a tiny volume is prone to all sorts of water quality issues.<br>  <br>  The smaller the tank the harder it is to stock and keep stable!!!<br>  <br>  edit: Petstores lie for profit. Small tanks are a waste of money!<br>  <br>  A single fancy Goldfish ACTUALLY needs more like 20 gallons or more.<br>  <br>  I'd ID that other "koi like fish" seeing as actual Koi should get 12" within a YEAR and actually need a MINIMUM of a 600 gallon pond! Common Goldfish have similar requirements, they need more like at least a 55 gallon tank or a 500-600 gallon pond.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Barely one. <br>  A two gallon could hold a single betta so long as it has a gentle filter, and an aquarium heater.<br>  <br>  ~EDIT~ You cannot judge how an animal should be kept by what you see in the pet store. It is difficult to efficiently house bettas when they have to be separated, and unfortunately many are kept in small cups. They can survive in them, but should not be subjected to those conditions forever.<br>  <br>  ~Please don't tell me that you have a bubble eyed goldfish and a koi in that tiny tank. <br>  A single bubble eye goldfish requries no less than 20 gallons, and should not be housed with a koi.<br>  An adult koi should be in at least 1000 gallons. They can grow 2-3 feet in length.<br>  <br>  I am amending my above statement- you cannot add anything to this set up. You need to rehome, return, or buy proper tanks for the fish you have.|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	I have a beta and he's in a 5 gallon tank. Just because they sell them in plastic containers and tiny bowls doesn't mean its a good environment for them.<br>  <br>  Gold fish need large tanks to live happily ever after. They poop a lot and need space and a good filtration system.|`|QV6swGUMaa	you are very misinform i am afraid to tell you.you should have a 20 litre or 5.28 us gallon tank for each of those fish at the very least .you cant fit anymore and that koi goldfish is going to outgrow your tank.he can be as big as 8 or 10 inches depending on type.my advice would be to get a bigger tank.pet stores dont usually care as long as they make money.bettas will do fine in less space than gold fish but it does not make it right ,think how much space they have in the wild.|`|fBYInMlNaa	Actually, pet stores never really take good care of any of their animals.  They only care about the money, not the animals welfare.|`|UbSJPBuNaa	you could probably keep 1 betta but they really need 2.5, not much else you could keep in there.<br>  <br>  edit: what you said about bettas is completly wrong bettas connot live a healthy life in the small containers that you buy them in, but you really only see that in places like wal mart.<br>  Also you couldnt have made a worse decision on picking your fish each gold fish needs about 20 gallons, since you have 2 you need about 35 gallons. so unless you can provide a proper home for them i suggest you return them to the store you got them from.
bDPVRtCNaa	You cannot continue breeding at this time, or at least with this male.<br>  Your male is out of commission. Isolate him and treat him in a gently filtered, heated aquarium.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	He's pretty much out of commission right now.  You're very lucky to have gotton him back alive!<br>  Right now, get him in a warm tank, possibly add a little antibiotic to the water to help stem and prevent any infections.  You can add a little aquarium salt as well, this is great for relieving stress and increasing their slime coat, helping to prevent and stop disease.<br>  Fin rot is your most likely disease to look for.  Frayed and rotting fins, it's an opportunistic bacteria, so any tears and rips are prime spots for it to get a hold of.<br>  A black spot could be anything, from a burn from soap, chemical, ect. to bruising.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|J6IA3tmsaa	Your Betta is stressed out and doesn't know what had happened to it.You should take care of it till it becomes active and normal like it was before. and he will only make bubble nest if he is happy i.e. stress free and healthy
ymU9QGlUaa	Realistically, you will never be able to find a healthy bulldog under that price.  They cost more than that to produce because of the necessity of cesareans and the costs of shots and upkeep.  Most of these dogs cannot breed normally, nor can they deliver normally.  That is why they are so very expensive.|`|AA11992723	wouldn't it be cheaper to buy one from a reputable breeder for $1000 than to pay $$$$$$$$ vet bills for a genetically sick and poorly bred one?|`|3giaPYe8aa	I rehomed a Bulldog from a Mennonite puppy mill for $1,100.00, and have spent thousands of $'s on her medical bills and medications.  There is your answer...NO!  Save your money to get one from a reputable breeder, or don't get one, at all!  (BTW, this breed is registered with the AKC as a Bulldog, not an English Bulldog)|`|Bw18seFqaa	lol  good luck FINDING one for that price.<br>  <br>  If you find one that cheap, it will most likely have health issues.  The breed is prone to many problems.  They are expensive to breed..  genetic health tests cost money, the breed also often needs artificial insemination and cecarians.<br>  <br>  If someone is selling so cheaply, that means they are cutting breeding costs..  they are not doing genetic health tests and prenatal care..<br>  <br>  with a breed that's prone to so many problems, it just doesnt pay to shop cheap.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	If you find somebody that says they bought a Bulldog for 500 bucks and it has had no medical issues......they are a liar.|`|okAYAGvXaa	I haven't and I wouldn't. <br>  There is always a reason for this kind of "pricing".|`|nwcsRZjnaa	i don't know anyone who has got a english bulldog for such little money and i would be very dubious of anyone selling one that cheap it may even be stolen so beware only goto a reputable breeder
dWcxjoLWaa	The fact that you are even asking this question worries me... If you have your heart set on buying one you should not only know the answer to this question, but you should also know that this breed along with most mosseler type dogs needs a strong owner with expierence in these types of breeds.  A dog is only vicious if you allow it to be.... to answer your question... and please research the breed more before your heart lands an untrained dog in a shelter.|`|pDv13gJwaa	you can make any dog mean or with work have a wonderful dog, I own a Pit Bull and she has been the best dog ever because we pay attention to her and train her so she knows what is expected. socialize your dog too so that they are use to all kinds of things ...This requires time and a lot of attention, if you don't have that and room, lots and lots of room to run..  don't get this breed.<br>  <br>  my guess is that you get rid of it because you can't handle it at 18 to 24 months....that's the number one age of animals at the shelter. <br>  <br>  oh and it's "dogue de bordeaux"|`|XIH2oKtJaa	i have a bordeaux x rottweiler and he is the sweetest dog. he is 4 in august and i've only had him a year. but he is so soft with everyone he comes across when with us, he's a good guard dog though so i don't think he'd be great if someone tried to break in... and he's not that great with dogs because he was attacked. but in the house he is very submissive - our staffy is boss over him lol. i think if you socialise it with dogs and children you should be okay, any dog has the possibility to be great, and the same to be bad it depends how they're treated.|`|3VO81VDSaa	They are wonderful but training and remaining alpha is a 24/7 task. They are a bully breed and will try their luck every day but once they know what is acceptable and expected of them they are big love bugs.<br>  Just remember these dogs are powerful and can not be stopped in full flight so prey drive and loose lead walking must be addressed from day one. If these dogs want to lundge they take some holding even for an human adult male, so be aware as you do not want a dog that you are unable to walk and these dogs can have very high prey drive.<br>  Pls pls think long and hard before taking one home.|`|nwcsRZjnaa	they can be a wonderful edition to any family if raised correctly and socilised properly buy from a good breeder so you have a healthy confident dog good luck

And wash and sanitize your hands thoroughly before touching them.<br>  <br>  If light hurts her eyes, just keep the shades or blinds drawn (don't keep her in total darkness, it will seem that much brighter later).  Make her a soft bed of blankets you can switch out and wash.  Keep noise to a minimum.  Clean her eyes to remove any discharge with a warm moist towel, and make sure she isn't chilled afterwards.  Keep offering food and water, so she keeps her strength up.  And visit often.  She needs your presence so she doesn't feel abandoned.

He is in the neurological stage and he started coughing about 2 1/2 weeks ago and i took him to the vet but they said it was just kennel cough. So the cough cleared up then his eyes got all red & swollen and he could hardly open them so I took him back and they said allergies. Ok so then 2 nights ago he started twitching in bed. He's been eating and drinking and everything which is good, but I got so sick of hearing everyone say he had to be put to sleep. I took him to a hollstic vet and he is positive for distemper and in the neurological phase. The vet gave him congaplex (1 pill a day) and a mixture and all I can remember from it is Vit. C. If you can't get to a hollistic vet I would start him on congaplex & thymex right away! Then get him some PB8 for diarrhea. Also try getting some colloidal silver and some saline solution for his eyes. My dogs eyes have cleared up in 2 days perfectly back to normal with just saline solution, it's amazing! Then some pulsatilla, 30c. Also 1 tbsp. of cod liver oil a day and 250 mg. of vit. C every 2 hours. Try just feeing him rice and meat or whatever he'll eat! If you have any questions my email is jm_mcclellan@yahoo.com. I feel for you my dog is going through the same thing but he's getting so much better this vet is amazing! And don't listen to people when they say put your dog to sleep you don't have to! He will get better just try not to go to a conventional vet with somethign like this because according to them, "there is no treatment".
FC5BxnoPaa	With my experience socializing my dog (female), I have found she gets along better with males.  Female - female always ends up in a fight.  And the two male dogs I have had were so lovable they would get along with anybody.  I would say male - female would be the safest bet.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	lol, two puppies, a pug and an English bull dog, and you want to make the situation less complicated.  You just made my day.  Well I wouldn't want to train two puppies at the same time, and two breeds as hard to train as the breeds you two have chosen.  I think it will be very stressful on the puppies since you don't live together, but will be spending time together.  I think it will stress them out to be driving back and forth.  Puppies ususally have limited space and when they can behave, they can graduate to more space.  I think two households will be stressful for the puppies.  If you get married and join households, it is going to be stressful for one of the puppies that has to move to a new home.  I wonder if you might be overwhelming these puppies.  I would go with a male/female balance, it is the only thing in this situation that will be less complicated.  Whether these two puppies get along will be based on your ability to train, and not a male female things.  While you should expect them to work things out for themselves, remember to step in if one of the puppies gets too rough.  You have to teach them they are each others pack now, and they have to get along.  I hope both of you have done your homework on your breeds and you are both experienced trainers.  I would never have the mental strenght to take on two puppies of such difficult breeds, but good luck to you both.  When you do move, unpack the puppies things first, it is less stressful.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	In general Male/Female do best.  But, I have had Male/male both adopted as adults that did wonderfully.  And I have had Female/Female that worked out very well.   <br>  I works best if you don't get two "Alpha" types no matter what the sex is.<br>  <br>  Either get Dominant/Submissive or Submissive/submissive.  Do not get Dominant/Dominant.|`|wqL84O8Naa	well they won't be fixed at first, so i wouldn't get them both until at least one is fixed. the earliest you can do it safely is 4 months. a male of any age will try to mount a female. If he's bent on getting a male, you should probably get a female, as there's always more of a chance of aggression with 2 males. If you decide to get 2 males, you shouldn't get them until they can both be fixed or you will have serious territorial issues UNLESS they are from the same litter.|`|AA11244754	You need to get one of each gender, as long as they are both fixed it will make a lot easier whereas if you have 2 males when they get old enough they will fight to establish whose the alpha of the 2.|`|Bw18seFqaa	typically opposite sex get along best.<br>  <br>  Its possible to have 2 males, best if both are neutered and at least one of them is submissive...  but if you happen to get 2 dominant males, you may have problems.|`|a162de189aa1c1becbdbb0cd4b7cd67caa	if they are truly puppies it really shouldn't matter.  however the female is going to be more dominant in some cases (as it should be *wink wink*) but that's just the way of dogs. <br>  <br>  but so long as they grow up together and they are both spayed/neutered i don't think it would really matter<br>  <br>  ohhh and i've always wanted a pug :D  they are sooo cute with thier little scrunched up noses haha.  <br>  goodluck with whatever you pick|`|teDI6RQ8aa	You should legally own one, and he should legally own one.

I hate answering in this category so many thumb down monsters
s76aC4G8aa	When she does, stand still and don't move until she' stops biting and looks at you when she does that give her attention, no attention when biting, attention only when she stops.  She'll soon learn that it doesn't get her anywhere and will soon stop as long as you don't "reinforce" the behavior by yelling, hitting or showing any attention at all.<br>  <br>  Make sure she has tons of sturdy chew toys of her own and try to redirect her biting your feet to biting her toys.  When she's playing with her toys praise her and play with her, that way you are reinforcing her playing with her toys.  Training takes a while, you have to show her what you find appropriate and what you don't, it's all part of the rules, boundaries and limitations that Cesar Millan talks about.  If you don't give her rules then she'll run the house and you don't want that.<br>  <br>  Good luck, also watching It's Me or The Dog on Saturday nights on Animal Planet will help you with any training issue you might have or encounter in the future.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	lol ... I hope this doesn't get deleted because I'm actually going to answer.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's the spay that set her off.  It's the age.  When they start heading into taht 7-8 month mark, they turn into little monsters.<br>  <br>  She's wanting your attention, and walking off is a start, because that takes your attention away, but if she's persistant, you're going to have to give her time outs.  This means 3-5 mins solitary confinement in her crate, without your beautiufl face to look at.  And no toys.<br>  <br>  She will figure out that every time she starts biting and nipping she ends up alone in her crate.  She doesn't want that anymore than you do so, she'll start to ease up.

My cat was dribbling and had really bad breath. Took her to the vets and they took her teeth out (apart from one) and run some blood tests and she has early signs of renal failure. She isn't poorly poorly with it but she drinks a lot and is very picky with her food. One week she'll eat like a horse and the week after she'll just have a bit here and there.<br>  My cat doesn't have a wash neither so i just make sure I brush her every day cos of her poorly kidneys it effects her fur - it comes out in big lumps so have to stay on top of it. Bless her. She still runs rings round me though for an old girl.<br>  Just old age I think and nothing you can do bout it except make things easier for her just like you would with your gran - lol. x|`|XAAF7R23aa	my cat who i miss a lot lived till she was 23. yes, its old age, as  she got older i used to buy chicken, tuna and salmon fresh she used to eat some of it, the dog has lost weight since she died, just keep caring|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Ya he is walking the same path as we all have to do. only thing is his is coming to a end now. He had a good full life so keep loving him to the end.|`|lFqUMMAGaa	Maybe your cat has trouble with her teeth ~ it's not always easy to see ~ take her to the vet to get her checked out ~ <br>  cause maybe something could be done to make her more comfortable ~|`|RT8LZy7gaa	Everything is related to age more than likely.  The only thing that concerns me are the weight fluctuations. This can be related to diabetes, kidney problems, liver problems, just to name a few.  It would be a good idea to give the vet a call to see if they suggest blood work.  But at your cat's age, it may be more stressful than helpful to get it done.  Unfortunately, this is the point in their lives when the owner has to decide on quality of life and quantity of life.  But see what your vet suggests.|`|yldVFIcXaa	My cat is nearly 19 and does dribble sometimes, it is purely old age, but the weight loss could be something seperate, it really would be best if you took the cat to the vet just for a quick check, the vet might be able to advise some things to help with the cat getting old.<br>  <br>  Do you take your cat to the vet anually?|`|Ksbf5OUQaa	I hope that it is old age, but she could have an infection, abscess, loose tooth, its obviously something in her mouth  that's causing this, and in all honesty you can't know for definite that your cat is totally discomfort  free. One of my old cats started to lose weight and dribble, it was mouth cancer and she was dead within the month, so please just take her to the vets, just to make sure she's ok.|`|HIav9sVuaa	its old age my cat never used to drible but shes getting on a bit now and shes started dribbling all the time :)i hope your cat is okay:)|`|BY0cV4kRaa	She may have gums problems|`|FF5AeHvqaa	It probably is but i would take her to the vet just to be sure.<br>  =^..^=|`|noJmRSYGaa	thats cute|`|OtiofeJiaa	some of her teeth could be loose or have tarter build up on them.Also is she drinking a lot because it could be diabetes.Mature cats can get it with age just like we can.I hope this is of some help and i hope she improves very soon.All best wishes<br>  Anne|`|f5618aa35eb852f89f010c9c3dd474a7aa	it probably is but you could always get her checked out just in case, my cats are 8 and both of them driible all the time too, they have nothing wrong with them though, they just dribble :)
hC4Z8HIbaa	Neutering will generally decrease the amount of aggression displayed by any animal, including rats. Neutering one rat does not mean you need to neuter the other. Keep in mind, however, that rat neuters can be somewhat expensive. I suggest calling around to local clinics and asking if they have any vets familiar with treating rats and if that vet is able to do a neuter. Some rat vets will not attempt neuters, and others that do may charge an exorbitant amount of money to do so.<br>  <br>  I suggest doing some searching around on the website below. Maybe you could find a vet in your area that does good, inexpensive neuters. It is an online rat forum, and typically if a member finds a very good rat vet, they will post about them. Or you could even make a post looking for vet suggestions in your area. I recommend the website to any current and future rat owners.
CUFnorZyaa	Reach in and take him out of his hide and handle him a few times a week. When he gets to be 3.5 or 4 feet long and bites you anytime you try to get him out you're not going to like it. So do it now while it's easier. <br>  <br>  And why are you feeding in a separate box? Unnecessary.|`|nM6Z3wAjaa	no need to be worried at all... its a ball python..if they are hidin then u are doin a good job of makin him feel comfy.... the only time u should be worried is when he is restless though out the day....<br>  <br>  mine only come out at night and late at night.. like around 2 or somethin when its real quite and pitch black....
3sB49YNnaa	Sadly, there is no sure way to prevent toxemia or ketosis as it is technically known.  If there were, the mortality rate in pregnant sows could be reduced considerably.  However, there are some things which help.<br>  <br>  The biggest thing is management consistency and stress reduction.  Do not change anything you are doing suddenly.  Poor diet, obesity and large litter size have all been implicated as contributing factors.  Do not travel with your pig (like trips to the vet) unless it is an absolute emergency since travel is a huge stress in pregnant pigs.<br>  <br>  Make sure that your sow is getting plenty of pellets with vitamin C, LOTS of hay, lots of water and a moderate amount of greens.  Under no circumstances let her run out of food or water as fasting can be a trigger for ketosis by causing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  Also, though it is counter intuitive, excessive sugary treats can cause problems because sometimes blood sugar drops when the regulatory mechanism that adjusts glucose levels in response to increased sugar overshoots.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, but our lack of ability to totally manage pregnancy toxemia is one of the major sources of risk involved in breeding,|`|yJWr6TxMaa	Increase her intake of Vitamin C throughout her pregnancy as the need for this will be higher.<br>  Ensure she has plenty of hay as this is a good source of vit C.<br>  Always provide her with fresh water.<br>  Reduce stress levels, do not over handle her as it may cause her to abort or have stillbirths.<br>  Allow her to excercise in order to keep her weight down.<br>  Allow to have slightly more food than normal by supplementing with fruit & veg (not too much though), but do not overfill the bowl as she may be reduced to eat everything causing her to become overweight.<br>  Hope this helps.
QV6swGUMaa	your tank is cycling so it is this happens so it does your no2 levels will spike and come back down then so they will.if you are going to add fish i would do partial water changes 20% each day until it is under 1.0 mg/l the next thing to happen will be No3 levels.have a look at this site will show ya how it works this is normal what it is just doing now :)<br>  <a href="http://faq.thekrib.com/begin-cycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://faq.thekrib.com/begin-cycling.htm...</a><br>  good luck.zebra dianos are good fish for cycling they are tough or guppies that is what is in my tank now that is cycling my other tank has finishd.when it is cycled your no3 levels will be a bit higher not more than 40 mg/l and they feed your plants.do weel\kly 20% percent change then and clean filter in tank water once a month only ever one filter at a time.good luck and dont panic :) your doing good :)|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	It's actually called the nitrogen cycle.  Nitrite is the second part of the nitrogen cycle.  First there's ammonia, then it turns into nitrite, then nitrate..so you're almost there.  You need a test kit that tests for all three, or at least find one for nitrate.  You will just need to wait a little while longer until the nitrites turn into nitrates.  Then, as long as nitrates are under 40 ppm, you can add your fish.  If they are too high just do a water change.  <br>  <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?c=3578&articleid=1165&category=266" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/articl...</a><br>  <br>  It has to go up before it goes down.  Just wait it out a little more, and if it doesn't go down after a couple more days or a week, do a small water change.|`|rWcKYyiyaa	You have to wait for the levels to return to normal before adding fish or you will likely kill them.  Making sure you have plenty of "good bacteria" in your tank will level out the nitrate levels in your tank.  A little trick I learned is to take a plastic pan/pot scrubber and put it in my filter and let it get full of good bacteria.  I never have any levels of anything out of whack with all the bio surface I have in my tanks.  <br>  <br>  I know you want to add fish but the tank has not cycled properly yet.  I would wait till the levels are normal.  What are you using for biological filtration?<br>  <br>  Click my source for more information|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Nitrite? If there are no fish in there, there shouldn't be any nitrites. I would not recommend putting the fish in there if you have nitrites.

9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Males are harder to place for many reasons.....for one, many people think that all males with be harder to keep in the house due to marking and such, which is BS, a well trained male can learn very easily not to mark in the house. Some people think males are harder because they can be more aggressive, more territorial and harder to handle, which again is not necessarily the case. <br>  And the other reason is that multiple males can't always live together. It's generally easier to keep mulitple females together than it is to keep multiple males.....so people that already have a male seek out a female whereas owners of females can always get another female. This is the case in my home, I love having male dogs but I already have 2 so adding more males may upset the balance I have in my pack so I don't think I will be adding another male any time soon. Adding females is usually easier than adding another male.<br>  <br>  What you can do is ask people why they prefer a female to a male and see if you can calm their fears about having a male dog.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Some people tend to think that males are meaner and bigger and not as cute and harder to train and pee on everything and hump everything.<br>  <br>  Totally not true, but, for someone who's never really known a well-behaved male dog, that's what they think.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Not sure its the dog not the gender for me.  Good luck with the spay agreement. hopefully they will follow through.. Other then that, I am sure you can find an owner for the dog.|`|BJugETlOaa	I have always owned male dogs so I don't know why. They are just as sweet and cuddly as female dogs.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	I have a friend who only likes female dogs and male cats (and kinda im total opposite - most of my cats are female and dogs are male). <br>  <br>  Their reasoning is that dogs pee on everything, marking their territorys even when they get fixed as a puppy, and I think alot of people think this is true. Especially for such a small breed that would HAVE to be an indoor dog.|`|e0uosNRsaa	Most people prefer females because they plan to breed them. The financial return on a female is much greater than a male. Females are also smaller than males in most cases too, which is appealing in toy dogs. If you had a giant breed, people might be more interested in males because they would be bigger. It just depends on the breed and why the people want the dog.|`|aYZXi6ffaa	I have a friend who has an unruly untrained non fixed male who humps everything in site.  He claims that all male dogs do this.  Some of his friends agree.  I am sure that most people know that this is not a tolerated behavior and given proper training and fixing of the males this doesn't happen.|`|KuUx34hCaa	Have hope I am sure some one will take him: Females don't hike a leg & usually females don't have a tenancy to roam good luck Ardy|`|gwUMipsUaa	Usually girls only want girls, and boys want big dogs.  I would take him, but I have two dogs(male and female) already.<br>  <br>  Something doesn't make sense.  If you took in the mom when she was pregnant, then your male is not the father.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I prefer males.  My mother always said if the household has little girls, get a male dog, if it has little boys get a girl dog.  You want a breed opposite of your kids.  My favorite is a saying....<br>  Female dogs love you, male dogs are in love with you.  <br>  I find that saying to be true in my life.  My male dogs have always had more love, and of course they tend to live longer.  Good luck finding this little guy a home.
enC9TvxUaa	-Won't hurt him, but has no nutritional value at all!  You're right- goes right through them!  The cheaper foods use corn as a filler!|`|bxlYleZkaa	Not at all, just a waste of time feeding it to him!|`|iVQULHqYaa	There is no food value in sweetcorn unless you pulverise it. If you fail to do so, sweetcorn and peas will look like sweetcorn and peas when they are excreted, however if you dog enjoys  this, what the hell.<br>  Never ever let your dog chew the cob as this will cause blockages.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	What do you suppose would happen if you ate a bunch of nuts with the shells still on them?<br>  Same thing, a kernel of corn has a shell on it that is composed of cellulose which dogs (or us) can't digest. That is why the grain mill was invented over 5 thousand years ago. Take the shells off those kernels of corn and they are quite nutritious. The idea that corn is not digestible is nothing more than an old wives tale.

Carrots and apples are a much better choice.|`|KxjUim7yaa	It goes right through your dog because it is not digested. So, about corn being in a lot of dog foods, again not digested well. That is why we do not feed corn to dogs! A grain free diet is best and many dogs are allergic to corn.|`|RvddYKqjaa	It isn't easily digestible, and therefore of no use to a dog. As you say, it goes right through him. We use to give our dogs a corn cob, which they enjoyed and didn't seem to bother them, but since I didn't know, I just didn't give it to our dogs after that. They were small dogs and didn't chew through the cob, but ate the outside clean. We serve our dogs very little in the way of human food. My husband's family had hunting dogs and they ate everything left on the table after dinner, including corn and corn cobs and a few fresh biscuits!|`|Xyj4nmFnaa	No you will find that sweet corn is virtually indigestible and is in the feaces of anything that eats it. and no it is not harmful to dogs its just one of the many vegtables that dogs like also try carrots they love to chew on fresh ones.you will find in many quality dog meats there is sweeycorn carrots and peas all included.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	yes a dogs digestive system cant digest corn it gos right throw them or it gets bond up in them. also corn is a common allergen for dogs as well a lot of cheaper dog food brands add corn to them as a filler it causes skin irritation.|`|okAYAGvXaa	It's not "hurting" the dog as such, however, the digestive system simply can't process the crap. I'd stop this practice.|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Very healthy to most animals even humans.|`|pDv13gJwaa	no, it's the number one thing in most dog food, another common one is rice|`|lNzhglLFaa	goes right through you too.... it is fine..no nutritional value to it... but if they like it...|`|rbtO73eZaa	i doubt it|`|rql2ZEJcaa	no....and the reason u see it in her poo is because a dog cant digest them so theres not much point feeding it as it has little dietary value.

MstjbpVJaa	As an ex breeder of kakariki's I found that it was very difficult to have one talk,so if you want to succeed then you are going to have your work cut out.<br>  <br>  My birds were kept in an Aviary,excepting for the ones that were wanted as Pets,as for their life span,it is short in comparison to a Cockatiel,(like wise their ability to talk) I had one that lived for 8 years,but have never heard of many that have lived longer,(my birds were well looked after and had the best of food and housing.|`|nTmra1qnaa	I own a Green Cheek Conure and when I first got him he was very quite now I can't shut him up, he can speak and I let him fly around my flat, I recently bought him a mate as he was getting very bored when I was at work during the day, parrots need alot of time and attention, you don't own him he owns you, Also parrots can live for upto 70 years so they are a life long commitment, <br>  <br>  Check out this site for info on kakariki's. <a href="http://kakariki.net/forums.html" rel="nofollow">http://kakariki.net/forums.html</a>|`|614tYbzxaa	Kakarikis are not noisy birds so are suitable if living in an apartment. They can learn to talk. Some males are quite good talkers, better than a cockatiel at times. Females are less likely to talk , although a few words are still possible. In captivity they live to about 5 years although some are known to live 15 years plus, depending on how they are looked after. If your bird is active and eating normally then i would not worry.
aD1no2cWaa	You should look online for the supplies you need and find out if you're ready for a hedgie. You should buy all the supplies (food, toys, cage etc.) and get them ready for your hedgehog. Then look online for breeders or go to a pet store.

tPGxPDvBaa	There is none that I know of. It doesn't go away & is a hereditary issue. You just treat the skin the best way as needed with special shampoos to help but nothing will cure it.  I have worked with many owners with treatments & they are usually poms but other breeds do get it also.
dOzlSdsDaa	I wouldn't be too concerned. If it is female, she may be in heat if you haven't gotten her fixed. If its male, he may be finding a female, marking his territory, or similar things. Above all, if it is a cat, it is nearly impossible to contorll its actions outside. I'm sure your cat will come back when she feels like it. My cat has been away from my house for up to a week, and come back, begging to be let in and fed. She'll probab;y be at your door either when you wake up in the moring, very soon, perhaps before you go to sleep, even, or in a day or two. You really shouldn't be too worried.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Not unusual for a cat!

If the vet did the tests earlier i might have still had my baby right now :((<br>  <br>  im not trying to scare you, my cat was 10, and she had previous illnesses which made it worse. But please dont panic, im sure its nothing bad, if he's young. You say when you pick him up by his stomach he meows, thats what my cat did.

Thank you for taking him to the vet- people now-a-days seem to not care about cats like they used to.|`|w1lh1INHaa	Wow, that  could be a number of issues, and it is good you are getting him to the vet.  Because diarrhea itself is so non-specific, you will only drive yourself crazy trying to look up and/or figure out the host of simple to not-so-simple issues this could relate to.  <br>  <br>  If you can. take a stool sample (even if it is just a little scraping of the diarrhea) with you so the vet can rule out worms/parasites.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|hKjQJNZAaa	aww poor kitty , sorry i dont know what could be wrong i just wanted to say i hope he gets better soon ,good luck xxxxx
zeTGmB3faa	Many times this happens when your cat has swallowed a foreign object and it stuck and causing an obstruction in the stomach. Get him to the vet. He is beginning to dehydrate from vomiting. <br>  My cat did this with curling ribbon. She was lucky and it did not require surgery but lots of barium during x-rays that moved it through and out of her system.|`|Nt7exGYAaa	This could be anything from a hairball, throat irritation, something he's eaten that's disagreed with him but the fact he can't go to the bathroom is something that needs to be checked by a vet.<br>  <br>  Is he lethargic as well?<br>  <br>  There are so many things that could be wrong but I'd suggest you phone the vet and he'll be able to tell you immediately what to do.  He'll undoubtedly ask you a number of questions that you can answer straight away and this will be the deciding factor if you should take him in or not.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|p4P24vtYaa	My cat does it when he feels under the weather, the vet said that it was all normal. He ate grass beforehand to help him be sick and the vet said that it looked like that cause of the grass. But you may want to check this out with your vet. <br>  <br>  Also, your cat may of eaten his food to fast.<br>  Good luck!|`|Si9hhcW1aa	You can take a sample if you wish. Sounds like your cat ate something that did not settle too well with him. But as long as you are taking him to the vet tonight. I would not worry too much now. You will find out what is wrong with him.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	RABIESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  DUCK AND COVERRRR|`|N1Ji0up1aa	my cat does this about once a month, and she is fine. she just has a sensitive stomach. sometimes it is b/c she ate some grass, or part of some flowers ive received. sometimes it is b/c she has a hair ball. nothing too serious, usually.|`|xedSZV7oaa	I have a cat also and sometimes its because its the food they are eating.  I changed his diet.  He is now eating iams and he hasnt had a problem since.|`|011sgO01aa	Have you ever seen the episode of south park where cartman wants to see if he puts food up his butt if he will poo out his mouth. Well same thing but I think your cats doing it with liquids|`|tgzGcu5uaa	Erm, this could be because there is a object in his body. You should take him to the vert right away incase it is serious.|`|t1zJt1Nmaa	better to be safe then sorry, im sure he is fine but it doesnt hurt to check <br>  and no body want a kitty to die!!!|`|yQdA5rHnaa	mine did the same thing last night, he'll most likely be just fine.
AA11812232	Try a heating pad on low underneath him and the other puppies.Just keep watching his food intake and  giving him the medications. Don't let him get cold.
QCL7WIEtaa	My cat loves to scratch and tear apart bags.  Thus I do not line my box with bags or liners.  Just use a scooper to scoop out poops clumps, sprinkle some baking soda and change the litter every few days.<br>  <br>  **I use disinfectant wipes to wipe it down every now and then.  Sometimes I will wash the box in my bath tub.  Cause I also live in an apartment.  Then just wash the bath tub when you're done. Install a detachable shower head to make this easier.|`|se27sAUwaa	I picked up this hypoallergenic litterbox liner, which looks EXACTLY like my kitchen garbage bag LOL, and my kitties would scratch at it when trying to bury their stuff. I read somewhere that cats will make a mess with their litter if they do not have enough litter or room. Try adding more kitty litter and see what happens. I added more to mine and they stopped scratching at the liner.|`|WpsPLKS7aa	Get rid of the plastic bag..lots of cats will claw them up.   Clean the box with baby wipes as best you can and then put box in your bathtub to clean.   No need for a hose.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Sounds like she doesn't like the liner in the box.  Try removing it and see how she reacts.  Cats are very eccentric and sometimes even the slightest little things will make them act neurotically.|`|AwjmyLJcaa	Cats love to play with bags, so she probably gets distracted when she's in the litter box and doesn't finish the job.  I would take the bag out, plain and simple.  However, this may not solve the problem.  One of my cats is 10 years old and he never covers his poop- it drives me absolutely nuts!

IrdZKYT3aa	Goldfish are capable of breathing atmospheric air, as we do, b/c of a simple lung system called the labyrinth.  As long as their membranes are moist they can breath.<br>  But it's  a horriblly slow and painful way to go, slowlly suffocating.  And many fish wil develop secondary infection from their leap from the tank.<br>  I've revived koi who are so dry they're tacky to the touch from being on the floor to long.<br>  A comet feeder was almost papery to the tough but was revived when I placed him back in the tank.<br>  It deends on the fish and the trama they recicived when leaping|`|eyKx05LKaa	First of all, keeping a gold fish in a bowl is not the best life for the fish, despite what pet stores will tell you.  Alot of people don't realize that gold fish can grow up to a foot long.  Keeping them in a bowl stunts their growth, which causes them discomfort.  You should really have him in an actual aquarium with a lid on it, and you won't have to worry about him jumping out, and he will be much happier.  Also, are you putting a conditioner in the water to remove chlorine?  If not, that will make him want to jump out because the chlorine burns their gills.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I don't know for sure, and I hope no one tests it. But if you can get to them in time you can often put them back in the water and they will survive.<br>  <br>  ~I'd worry about it constantly if I were you. The fish is just as apt to die in the bowl as it is out of the bowl. A bowl is a death trap. You need a properly sized aquarium (20+ gallons) and double the filtration.|`|pcvcMePXaa	well first off gold fish shouldnt be in a bowl ever, so move it to a 10 gallon tank minimum and you wont have this problem along with the problems of it living in a bowl and swimming in filth all the time, but until you get a 10 gallon tank id suggest putting something on the bowl so he cant jump out of the tank|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	Probably no more than minute.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|QrjjiOgTaa	it is probably hopping out of the bowl because it rather die that way than drown it in own pee a.k.a ammonia, it cannot breathe, get it a cycled, 20 gallon tank or don't get fish. please return it to the pet store before you kill it.|`|rzZqnSQhaa	i don't know.but if you try it i say your a very sick person.it's a very wonderful animal you treat it nicely.|`|QV6swGUMaa	not to long i would say about the same amount of time you could stay under water without dying give or take a few seconds .|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	Goldfish need a 20 gallon filtered tank, no wonder it keeps jumping out!|`|yX9Vte6zaa	Goldfish will DIE in a bowl!!get a 20 gallon!!!!|`|SOxdyWQOaa	I don't know maybe 20 minute at the most try putting something over the tank
9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Yes, it can kill a dog or make a dog very ill. Chocolate has theobromine which is a chemical that dogs can't process and can cause heart issues, seizures and in small amounts can cause vomiting and diarrhea.<br>  <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/pets/chocolate-chart-interactive" rel="nofollow">http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/1...</a>|`|Um8osMNuaa	lt contains Theobromine which is toxic to dogs.<br>  Dark and bakers chocolate contains higher amounts and is more dangerous for them.<br>  <br>  lt can cause hyperactivity, kidney damage, irregular and increased heart rate, muscle tremors, vomiting and diarrhoea, they can also pass large amounts of urine and be excessively thirsty.<br>  The signs of sickness may not be noticed for several hours.<br>  lf a dog has ingested a large amount of chocolate then it needs to see the vet.<br>  if eaten in large amounts it can kill, but it is rare that this happens.|`|e1a2b7e967effa31dda9b63713c82d26aa	yes it possibly could...our jack russell love chocolate...he stole a whole easter egg couple years back...had to go to vet for injection to make him sick...cost over ￡100.00....so steer clear of chocolate....but also our jack russell stole every choc off xmas tree one year...but was not poorly with it.....just be careful and keep them away from it!!!|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	It would take large amounts depending on the dogs size.|`|3n73f2Szaa	Chocolate is poisonous to dogs. It contains theobromine which the dog can't metabolise. It's best not to give the dog chocolate at all. Many dogs end up at the vet over Christmas and Easter through eating chocolate.|`|upNfdhz9aa	yes it can, the chocolate is poisonus to the dogs system. If it has a tiny hershey kiss, one time then the dog will be fine. But if the dog has excessive amounts, it will die for sure|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	It can kill a dog.  Some breeds are more sensitive to it than others, and usually a small amount will only upset their stomach, but you should never let a dog eat any chocolate.|`|FoSTohYlaa	If you give a dog to much chocolate (depending on it's weight) it will kill the dog without medical attention.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Yes. Do not feed your dog chocolate!! It's toxic to them. Save the chocolate for yourself and give them a treat that's good for them.|`|WTtAX0AEaa	Well I'm Not Sure About Other Dogs But I Have A Pug And If She Has Chocolate It Will Kill Her.|`|AA11644770	i hope not my great dane has just gone over the shops to buy him self a mars bar|`|48e1e6f942ac206ac7f87f19384c9413aa	yes|`|VSWl45cKaa	There are various types of chocolate. White chocolate is the least harmful and dark baker's chocolate is fatal in small doses. <br>  <br>  Read authoritative information here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pets.ca/pettips/tips-20.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pets.ca/pettips/tips-20.htm</a>|`|fgxajTiBaa	Certain types of chocolate are more or less fatal. More instance, it takes a very small amount of baking cocoa to kill even a large dog, but white chocolate will not do anything. If your dog got into a bag of small candy, most likely he would be fine as long as it was milk chocolate. <br>  <br>  It's certainly not something to give them as a treat though, you don't want them craving it and searching it out themselves.
se27sAUwaa	Slap this lady?? She wants her dog to keep having puppies because she's getting $$$$ for the pups. What does she care if its sick or not. What's one dead pup to her? That's disgusting. Seriously, like when your boyfriend is not looking - give grandma a shove near the stairs. Say it was karma, lol. Well if she doesn't want to hear what you have to say, maybe she'll listen if the Animal Care and Control show up at her door. You can make an anonymous complaint. Not sure if it's severe enough but I would def. try. Or you could threaten her with calling them, but I'm guessing you want to stay with your boyfriend for a bit longer....  What a shame though.|`|IzezjhUBaa	No offense but i would call a animal cruelty line and go from there they should be able to get the sick puppy and take it too adequate help...|`|AA10569967	Call your local ASPCA anonymously so they can investigate. Its not fair to anyone (puppy included) that she doesn't want to take responsibility for the animals shes breeding!!!!|`|nOgVGCGtaa	Go to a vet!!!!!!!and ask for meds and it will be gone in like a day.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	She is breaking the law. You should call Animal Control. Do you have Animal Control in her city or town? The puppy needs to see a vet. She is being selfish, stupid, and irresponsible. I would not stand for it. I would ask her so where did you go to vet school? You think you know more than a trained veterinarian that had to have an almost 4.0 GPA to get in to vet school?  I mean come on. Know your limitations, her, not you of course. Leaving the puppies out in the cold. How about we leave her out in the cold?  I would call Animal Control and/or the police. She'll be fine but those dogs may not be. They have done nothing to deserve this treatment. They are innocent victims.|`|iXijnCxOaa	Don't you think it would be better for the sick puppy to be with someone who would actually take care of it????|`|nd30LQhlaa	you can call a vet and youll either have to come see them or they can terll you which kind of wormer to get...and you are right for not giving the pup away...it wouldnt be fair to the new owner and its not fair to the puppy...also She shouldnt keep breeding her dog and if you want to save the dog and any future puppies then call your local ASPCA and tell them about everything or ask the vet what could be done...good luck!|`|3hBQz33Yaa	That is awful. There is no excuse for her not to treat that pup! If she doesn't want to spend the time or money treating any sick pups then she shouldn't be breeding. Well she shouldn't be breeding period. For her to let a sick pup suffer until she can con some people into buying it and making it their problem is sick. People like her is the reason so many dogs are in shelters and getting put down. The poor thing needs to see a vet if she continues to refuse then she needs to be turned in.|`|krThCHxyaa	call animal rescue|`|atn30lRPaa	go to a vet
IrdZKYT3aa	She may be having some serious complications in the birthing process.  Some females just don't handle large biths well, and any stress she may have been or may be currentlly experienceing can affect her health.  If she feels truly worked up,she may retain the fry, this usually is deadly to them as well as the female.<br>  Try adding a little aquarium salt, this can help relive stress, and help her pass the fry and any blockages that may be causing or caused by the constipation.<br>  Also, try gradually raising the temp to around 82-84 degrees.  This can also help relieve her stress and help her pass the fry.<br>  The raised Scales you mention worries me.  It could be that she is simply so full of fry she's that swollen, but that's so incredibly rare.<br>  More likely is she's developing dropsy.  This is a serious and highly contagious disease.  If she's not already separated, please do so.  Many stores will sells meds for dropsy, but the survival rate is pretty low.<br>  Check your water quality, stress and dropsy are often caused by poor water quality.  Check your waste levels and perform a water change.<br>  Get her seperated ina  clean warm tank and add the salt.  The turn the lights out and leave her alone in a low traffic and quiet area.  You may wish to hold off on the dropsy meds if you feel she's merelly swollen, they are often harsh and can be deadly to the fry.<br>  Best of Luck!

5qIOzchwaa	oh I always did yoga before a show, also get up a little earlier and do it before you get there. Stretching is really good for you. There's a book you can look up (you can probably get it cheap on amazon and they do overnight shipping) called yoga on horse back. it has tons of exercises you can do on your horse too, which is good because it helps your horse get used to you doing different things on him/her. Also, if you have a ledge (or maybe even try a stair just be careful) put a little more than the ball of your foot on the stair and just hold the rail for balance, anyways raise up on the ball of your foot as high as you can and then lower it as much as you can. helps with the calves. get a ball with out much give to it like a soccer ball and put it in between your legs and squeeze as hard as you can. As for arms/abs the best thing to do is to get those stretchy things for your arms (the work out ones) and have someone stronger than you hold it and you can practice pulling back on it. BTW. there are other ways to cure a strong mouth than getting stronger, the reason she has a strong mouth to begin with is because some one got in it too much. not trying to sound rude but it won't help you any. Hope this helps :) Have fun at the show!! it's the most important part :)|`|BREi7qw7aa	try running to keep your endurance up. also, try to stay a way from junk foods, and stick with high energy healthy foods. Also, try ab exercises, like bicycles and crunches, to keep your core strong<br>  Good luck!|`|AiAHnPyDaa	Buy a beach ball (small) and stretch you calves and legs. Also stretch your legs and a step.
Z1ftrUJuaa	I'm not totally sure about scholarships for eventing or dressage, but most schools do NOT have a dressage team, and even fewer have an eventing team. Most schools have an equitation team, part of the IHSA. This means that more of their money for scholarships is going to get riders that are hunter/jumpers and not eventers or dressage riders. Now there are more schools with dressage teams, the IDA is growing, but it's not anything huge yet.<br>  <br>   In terms of scholarships for either discipline I would recommend looking into companies that support either discipline- Bit of Britain, a saddle maker, etc etc, and see if they offer any sort of scholarship. I would also recommend to STUDY HARD, you are much more likely to get an academic scholarship. Use your knowledge/schooling to fund your riding, as it is much harder to do it the other way around.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	You might want to join Pony Club if you're not already in it.  I think they might have some scholarship opportunities.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I can't help you much with the horse-related scholarships, but I do want to tell you that there is a ton of financial help available to college students.  There is FAFSA, TAP loans, private loans (as a last resort only) as well as scholarships and work study.  I was the only high school graduate I knew whose parents weren't paying for my college, and I panicked at first too.  But pretty much everyone has to take out loans for college, so don't be too scared to do so when the time comes.  You have plenty of time to pay it back, and it's probably one of the lowest interest loans that exist.  Don't sweat it, it will work out fine!|`|TTLIp8Beaa	the best bet for you is to get a good horse (either lease or buy), a good trainer and start competing in affiliated shows. <br>  there are also many different types of financial aid, as well as academic scholarships available (non horse related)|`|1zfKVG5Xaa	colleges.mywebcommunity.org - try this site. It has info about different US scholarships for college students and their grades requirements.
0b1fa9ca19ef34843cb9155776450abaaa	Having the scent glands removed is not necessary, as they only use these when scared or frightened.  Having them castrated/spayed does help reduce the smell.  Washing a ferret, in fact makes it smell a few days later as the ferret replaces the oils in it's coat, plus it's bad for it's skin to regularly wash a ferret. You can buy a ferret deodourizer from the pet shop but I have never used it on mine so I can't comment on that.<br>  <br>  As long as you clean the toilet area out as it's soiled and bedding and hammocks kept clean and washed you will hardly notice the odour. I personally think Hamsters and mice smell worse than a well kept ferret.|`|fzaf5t3Caa	well if you keep it confined to one room with the door closed, the smell isn't bad anywhere but that room. You can bathe it but not too much or it will produce extra oils that make them smell. I used cat deodorizer powder in my ferrets litter pan once and it really helped. You should get a ferret they are really fun. I have two =]|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	Ferrets don't really have a STRONG odor. I mean they have a ferret odor but it is not that noticeable and the cage doesn't smell unless you don't clean it and the litterbox. Having a spay/neutered ferret will help the smell a lot.<br>  <br>  Do not bath them regularly it will make them stink BAD because of the oils in their skin are stripped making them produce too much oil.|`|IIGUbf6kaa	I have four and we live in a smallish 3 bdrm house and the only time you smell anything is only in the ferret room when the litterbox needs changed. And even then it isn't strong at all.|`|dmfdqKovaa	first of all dont get a boy they absolutly STINK then if you clean the cage out every day or two and put a litter tray in there and train it to use it it should reduce the smell|`|rBTxIbh0aa	regular baths and its possible to get the glanes that couse most of the smells that come with a ferret removed|`|9b3d00525945c090a16f791aa6c509ddaa	NO DO NOT GIVE FERRETS TO MANY BATHS<br>  That will only make his body produce more musky oil glands <br>  Clean cage every night make sure they are de cented and spayed <br>  feed them hi protein cat food (Professional is a good cat food)<br>  Do Not feed onions fruit or fiber it will cause blockage and they are not ment to digest it<br>  get ferret for dummies first and second edition <br>  Never use clay litter as it can get up their lil pee holes and cause blockage and infection which Will lead to death in ferrets if left untreated <br>  use horse pellets <br>  No Cedar either it will cause infection in chest
XTDeAfTqaa	That sounds great! I just rescued a 7 month old male Husky who had been cooped up in an 8'x6' pen for most of his life. He even came with papers and I got him for free.<br>  One problem. He has not been exposed to cats (or other dogs for that matter) and I have 6 Felines. He took to my other Huskies immediately and loves my Wife and I but we are not sure whether he can ever be trusted around the cats. We're working on it.<br>  I would take the Lab to the Vet (at your expense) and have it looked over before purchasing it to look for any congenital problems. Make sure it is up to date on all shots. If the Vet gives it a clean bill of health then buy your Lab and be happy you don't have to put up with house training.<br>  Sounds like a great find!|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Personally, I don't think there are any cons. I prefer to get older dogs to young puppies. At 10 months old, the dog is still very much trainable and he's already past much of the puppy stage. Housebreaking and socializing is the biggest part of raising a pup and it sounds like this dog has already gone through all that. <br>  I think as long as the dog has a stable temperament, getting an adult dog vs. a puppy is much easier and can be a very pleasant experience.|`|AA10229248	At that age I can't think of any cons. <br>  <br>  Unless he has some congenital medical problem. I fostered a dog that was around that age and given up because he allegedly had seizures. We also had one come into rescue that we later found out had a liver shunt. But those situatations are rare.<br>  <br>  Usually at this age they don't have any behavioral issues except for the regular puppy stuff that some people just aren't prepared to handle so they sell the dog.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Really are not any!  As you said, he is potty trained, soon to be out of the biting/chewing stage.  Knows about kids/cats.  Likes his crate.  WWhat more could you ask for?  He is young enough he will have no issues at all bonding with his new family!|`|aGYvN9pfaa	I've never "bought" a dog, I've always adopted from rescues. Two of my current dogs were adopted when they were pretty young: a 10 month old Shepherd/Husky mix and a 9 month old Greyhound/Pointer mix. Both are fantastic dogs. They were already housebroken, pretty much full grown, so I knew how big they were going to be. And you can more easily start oobedience training on an older dog because they concentrate a little better. All I see are pros!|`|okAYAGvXaa	There are no "cons" when buying healthy, well socialised and good natured pup.<br>  Toys and whatever the woman may say doesn't matter.<br>  Use your OWN personal judgement when you SEE and INTERACT with the pup.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	One possibility: <br>  <br>  someone that "doesn't have time" for their dog usually means there are some behavoural issues that the owner is just not willing to deal with<br>  <br>  but if you like the dog...get the dog.|`|h1XOY41Faa	i done had alot of dogs. my first one happened to be a lab. to me there are no cons. the pros are that your puppy will grow to love you and protect you. it will know you like no 1 else. but thats me|`|WLNX00c3aa	there really is no con in purchasing a dog.  you are at the point where training is a must!!!<br>  <br>  good luck on you new addition.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	If he really is potty trained, good around cats and kids, etc. then your off to a good start with just an older puppy. So I don't know of any cons.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	he will be already potty trained he isn't to old he will still attach to you trust me puppy stages can be stressing like having a baby its like getting a 4 year old instead|`|bRVHkjTXaa	The only one I can see is "the lady does not have enough time for him." Hopefully you have enough time to train him not to do what ever he has done while no one was watching him. I purchased an 18 mo old dog, he came from an all spanish speaking home and we do not speak any thing except english.He has ate my clothes and slippers, lifted his leg and peed on my couches. But he is learning every month things get a little better!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Are you sure she's not just a BYB that reduced the price to get the dog off her hands for a few $$$?|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well I would take a guess that while she is claiming this 10-month-old puppy is potty trained,  I am going to say it isn't.  Puppies are not fully potty trained until they are 1-year-old.  I would guess that this woman hasn't potty trained this puppy, and I am going to guess that she hasn't trained him on a whole lot more.  I would require proof of shots by a vet!!!!!!  I would never buy a puppy that old, but if you think that you have the ability to train him and you have the extra time to train him, than go ahead.  Labs need a lot of exercise.  Probably two hours of walks per day and some good running.  Labs are a breed where the more running they do the more energy they have, so you need to be up for a lot of exercise.  It is your life, and you know your ability to train, and how much mental strength you have, so this is really up to you.  I wouldn't do it, but it is your decision.

NOW|`|bpd7uyYVaa	I used to breed guinea pigs, female piggies usually don't like involvement with the birth. They would rather give birth in solitary. Just make sure there are plenty of pet blankets around that she can nest the babies in. As for prenatal care, they're usually pregnant for around 2 months, and she'll need lots of vitamin C and more water. Also, after the birth be sure to keep her separated from any males, as she'll go into heat again right after.

TTLIp8Beaa	don't lash the whip at him. <br>  if you want to push him out, position the whip either close to his shoulder or right behind it (by his elbow).<br>  don't actually touch him with it, but send him out. if he gets too close to you then he'll run into the end of the whip and probably give himself a little scare. this will help you move his shoulder out and keep him in a round circle. after a few strides, move the whip back by his tail to keep him moving forward. <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Lunge-a-Horse" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Lunge-a-Horse</a>|`|BREi7qw7aa	when he starts to fall in, extend your whip arm slightly, and if he still doesnt respond, raise it a little.

What I do is stay persistent.  Try not to create another problem by spooking your horse.  Speak sternly so they know that you are serious.  Make hand gestures and wave the end of your line slightly, in a circle, but not so much as to spook your horse.  When your horse gets frightened on a lunge line, he will probably think of the lunge line as a spooky thing or as danger, and this causes problems. <br>  <br>  Make sure you always end on a good note.  Do NOT give up.  This will teach your horse that he can get his way by being lazy, and lazy horses are the ones that have the habits that are hardest to break!

mRevWUxlaa	Get her some chew toys.... good quality ones and some pressurized rawhide bones. If she bites you, put your thumb under her tongue and your fingers under her jaw and press until she acts uncomfortable and firmly say, "NO BITE" I did that with both my APBT's and they never bite except on their toys and bones!!!! Good Luck and hope this helped!!!!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Trade your fingers for toys and bones.  Wear garden gloves when training if necessary.  I point, snap my fingers and say "no biting" and when she stops biting, I praise her.  Since she is a border collie, she will bite as a means of herding, so you are going to need to train her to do something else.  When she tries to bite, teach her some other activity like to sit, or shake or something else.  The baby teeth come out between 4 and 6-months-old, so hang in there.|`|OAWCNff5aa	What I did was just take away everything she was biting and replace it with a dog bone .. it worked after a while !|`|jUcwlZzCaa	You need to trade whatever he his bitting with a toy that he likes.<br>  It will take a while...he's a puppy and will do this for months...<br>  So crate him when you're not there...and watch him carefully when you're with him...He will be teething and it will get a little bit worse<br>  but it will not last for ever...be patient.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Well you have a mix of two breeds that are going to nip. <br>  <br>  Border collies, they are herd dogs - they nip at livestock to get them to move. <br>  <br>  Labradors are retreivers that are very mouthy dogs. <br>  <br>  When she does it, tell her NO! And if she does it while playing stop playing with her.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Don't leave her unattended. If she is starting to chew something inappropriate, tell her "no" and substitute something that she can chew. Keep an assortment of things for her.|`|yTfO0fGmaa	There are a few ways you can overcome this. <br>  1. Make sure she knows what she is allowed to chew and what shes not. Get her into chew toys such as rawhide, rope toys or Kong. You can soak the rope int a broth/ stock and freeze it, this makes it more appetizing, puppy kongs can be frozen as well. <br>  2. When she nips, no matter where you are give a loud "OWW" or "NO". No other attention apart from that. If she is playing when she nips, again the word of your choice and then stop playing with her otherwise your gonna confuse her. <br>  <br>  Collies are a very clever breed so she should pick this up pretty quickly. Its all about routine, make sure everyone in your family knows what to do when she nips and any friends and family who come over. If she is only being told off when she does it to you, she may take advantage of that fact when you have visitors over.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and would love to know how you get on!|`|uYb5z0JIaa	well, u can tell her no, no, and at the same time kind of tap her with some old rolled up newspaper, it'll scare her a little, don't tap her hard, just enuff 2 know that u mean business when u say no no. and when u're out shopping, take her 2 petsmart, or petco and get her some little chew toys.

zNJbIqX6aa	It isn't common, you may be keeping them in a room that is too extreme of a temperature. Are you giving them clean water and fresh food all the time? What are they being fed?

Hamsters can suffer from diarrhea for other reasons besides wet tail, however, as the hamster can dehydrate quite rapidly it is important that the vet examines him and rehydrates him and prescribes antibiotics, if necessary.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, it could be that he has some sort of infection or abscess and this is pus or similar.  In which case he still needs to go to a vet for antibiotics.
P0p2p4utaa	I had that to happen to me a few years back and they where all fine. I had a 98% hatch rate. It will depend on the fertility of the egg and what kind you are incubating.

kvHqnR5Haa	You should crate train her.  She should be in her crate when she is alone and at night.  That way she does not have the opportunity to destroy anything and if the crate is the correct size she should not soil in it.  Just don't use the crate for punishment or it won't feel like her safe place.  Good luck!|`|gwUMipsUaa	When she bites, just get up and walk away.  This will take a few days before she gets the hint.<br>  <br>  As for peeing and pooping, she needs to be taken out to potty every 45 minutes.  After a month you can start taking her out every hour.  Do this up until about six months old.  Then you can go every hour and a half to two hours.  Continue this for the rest of the dog's life.<br>  <br>  As for her eating things, puppy proof the house.  That means put everything out of her reach.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well first, I don't use the command "no"  it is confusing to a puppy.  The word "no" comes up in conversation, so the puppy could be being good and they hear that word and think they did something wrong.  Try "shame" or "ssht"  The baby teeth don't come out until 4 to 6-months-old, so trade your fingers for a toy or bones.  I point, snap my fingers, and say "no biting" and when she behaves, I say "good girl"  Remember to praise when they do good, so they keep doing good.  She shouldn't have full run of the house, it is overwhelming.  Small spaces at this age, and when she can behave in that space, she can graduate to more space, but always supervised.  Block off an area for her so she can't get into wires or under furniture and ahold of fish tank scrubbers.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|fMRcX2WDaa	Step1Decide on the potty command you will use and where you want the puppy to go. This can be your whole backyard, or designated areas within your yard. <br>  Step2Take the puppy out right when you get him home. Show him where you want to him to go, and be sure to use your selected command right after he goes, in addition to your praise. For example say "good potty." <br>  Step3Watch for signs that she needs to go potty, such as circling, squatting or whining. As soon as you see this take her outside immediately. <br>  Step4Wait for him to go, and then praise him thoroughly. Wait and see if he needs to go more than once and if not go back inside. <br>  Step5Correct any accidents you see in progress. Try to hurry the puppy outside and if you are not in time, just say "no" firmly but do not punish strongly. Punishing will only cause her to hide in the future. <br>  Step6Clean any accidents quickly and thoroughly. Be sure to clean all the way down to the carpet padding. If the puppy can still smell it, he will think he can still go in that spot as a natural instinct. <br>  Step7Practice with your puppy consistently and continue to watch for warning signs at all times. Potty training takes time and you have to remain consistent in order for it to be successful.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	welcome to the joys of having a puppy take your puppy out more often try puppy pads praise her for doing good things.  When shes biting and chewing give her her toy every time this redirects her back to whats hers or get a spray bottle and squirt her shes bad hopefully she won't like the sprays good luck|`|vouUQQzBaa	You need to train the puppy.<br>  Buy a crate and set a routine for eating, drinking, going to do her needs..etc.etc....That will help for housebreaking her.<br>  <br>  For teething, buy chew toys. Firmly tell her NO when she attempts to chew on anything else. When unsupervised, she should be sleeping in her crate.|`|mhkYR0rIaa	watch ceser milan (Dog whisperer) and Victoria Stillwell (It's me or the dog). They are on animal planet.

bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	Vets are great for medical advice, but they are not nutritionists. In fact most of them recommend the worst foods out there. <br>  <br>  By getting 'sick' what exactly do you mean? Is she throwing up? What does it look like? If its foamy and yellow that's bile. It means your dogs stomach has been empty to long and she has a build up of stomach acid. Feeding her will solve the problem. Try to give her a snack every night to avoid it. <br>  <br>  If that's not what you're talking about please explain in more detail and include the name of what exactly you are feeding.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Depending on what the food is, it still might be the food.

41055ae0e3e48e9a0e089b2b1828b112aa	Hmm, most guinea pigs are quite like this. But you could make him less nervous by maybe spending a lot of time with him and maybe when you are with him clap your hands, and he will learn its ok.<br>  But instintively they are like this.<br>  Good luck xxx|`|EmJ6x7ftaa	Trust me, that's normal. Well, what kind of environment is it in? And what are you doing with it? Try making loud sounds around him but make sure he knows its just you, if hes inside try keeping music on, I know they like that, when you are done making loud noises reward him w/ grass, lettuce, carrots, or stuff like that. But Guinea Pigs are generally like that anyways.|`|hqnYJV38aa	Guinea Pigs are primarily on this planet to be food for other animals. That is why they are timid animals. They are scared of sudden movements and loud noises because they are not sure whether or not that will be the last thing they hear.<br>  <br>  Well, that being said, Piggies can be conditioned to respond differently to some noises (like your voice, the veggie bag opening) and not run and hide. (My boys squeak like crazy as soon as I open the veggie drawer in the fridge)<br>  <br>  Well all in all guinea pigs are timid creatures. Just be patient with them, they will get used to you and their surroundings eventually and realize that you are not a predator.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	you should move your guinea pig to a quieter area were he doesn't get that much action. they can get overwhelmed by all the sights and sounds. also, he can just be anxious. try to let him run around as much as possible, and in the summer you can put them in a dog pen and let them munch on grass and run around. just make sure they are not around dogs because they can get heart failure from being chased. good luck and hope this helped.|`|mhkYR0rIaa	It's because of his size. He really has no defense system in his body. It's the same thing w/ humans, why are some kids shy? No reason really. It's called the "flight or fight" system. Either you fight back what your scared of or you run. He probably experienced a loud noise that scared him when he was just a baby.<br>  Try this: Keep making loud noises and fast movement around him. When the noise is gone or the movement is done, reward him w/ love and affection so he knows he is ok, and that he has nothing to be scared of. It takes time, but he will get used to it.|`|TWHQxWytaa	For the first few weeks that you have a guinea pig, they may seem scared, but that just means that it doesen't know you very well.  Play with him once or twice a day and he should feel a little less scared.  Like the person before me said, its thier instinct.

cek7fcU4aa	the ear mites is a possibility...but is your cat white? if so then its sun burn...really common.|`|GduRpnn0aa	The most probable cause is that your cat has developed an allergy to something in its environment. Have you changed her food, applied any anti-flea medication, or changed something else, such as her bedding?<br>  <br>  Allergies are the most common illnesses affecting cats. They are caused by changed lifestyles, including food and environment. Cat allergies are characterized by the body's abnormal reaction to internal or external stimuli and are caused by many different factors. Allergic reactions can be different from one cat to another, even for the same allergen (agent). Sometimes, these allergens are in the cat’s own body, causing the body to react against itself such as in auto-immune diseases. It is important to try to find the cause for cat allergies, even though it can be difficult. Along with working towards finding the cause, the use of herbs is recommended to ease the symptoms, and also to strengthen the immune system.<br>  <br>  Common Symptoms of Cat Allergies:<br>  <br>  Skin problems (the most common evidence of allergic reaction) <br>  Eruptions, redness and itchiness of the skin and swelling of the affected area <br>  Digestive problems (such as diarrhea and gas) <br>  <br>  For allergies, I give my cats Stimmune, a herbal supplement that helps to alleviate cat allergies by maintaining natural balance within the body and by stimulating the immune system. It can also be used to treat recurrent infections and fatigue.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-allergies-p85.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-allergie...</a>|`|LxBwmRTlaa	It can be ear mites, fleas or change of diet or even ring worms.

YtBzRAxMaa	Sorry - but it sounds like this horse is not trained at all or was not trained properly.<br>   Girthy = NOT tacked up properly - someone has tightened the girth too tight and too fast.<br>  #2 - She has not been taught to stand / tie nor give to pressure...or she has been abused in this situation....<br>  #3 She does not feel safe enough to canter. She is not balanced. Probably her top line is not strong enough to balance both of you at the canter<br>  <br>   There is no way you should be hitting /clucking / cropping / spurring this horse. She needs TRAINING and conditioning.<br>  <br>   GROUND MANNERS<br>  <br>   Please lease a different horse - this one is not trained and you are wasting the $$$.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	First thing I would do is exercise her really well  before I attempted to mess with her. Until you see her relax and looks ready to work for you.  You have to get there mind in the right place before you begin lounging her is good or round penning.  If you have these kind of problems you don't ever want to work with her fresh that just starts fights.   You don't want to try to punish her when she is fresh, that is a good way to get you and her hurt.  This is very important so try this first.<br>  <br>  How are you putting on her gear?  If you are cinching her up tight and fast could explain the first.  Cinch her up just enough to hold the saddle on at first then after you walk her around a bit then tighten it up.<br>  <br>  Are you gentle bitting her up or moving fast because you are anticipating the worst?<br>  <br>  These are some other things to think about.  The bad thing is once she has learned to pull back and get away while putting on the halter or bridle she knows she can do it with you and you are going to have to take a few more precautions. Personally I would start practicing putting the bridle on and off over the halter and have someone hold on to her with a long rope maybe a lounge line while you do it..  Take it slow and easy being careful not to hit her eye, or pull hair etc.<br>  <br>  You can work on drop you head and relax which will help her out<br>  <br>  Added. As for the cantering issue.  <br>  Since you have already tried different things like a crop, spurs,etc.  then you need to get a ground man/woman on the lounge line or in the roundpen with you who can encourage her from ground while you are on her back with a lounge whip or rope or what ever she is familiar with.  This will take any fight away from you the rider and put it on the ground were the job will for sure get accompliched.  As she improves you can go back to working on it without help.|`|XbQGyiT7aa	i would work with her on a lunge line. that way she can find her own balance. when she's good with that, then you can have someone hold the lunge line while you're on, or vice versa. another way to help with transitions is to do exercises that increase it. a lot of downward transitions will help as much, if not more, than the upward ones. <br>  <br>  while you're working with her on the ground, desensitize her to the whip and spurs. rub her with them (if you can). when she's fine with that, start cueing her with them (gentle taps where you would usually cue a horse). slap your leg with the whip so she won't overreact to the noise. don't stop until she calms down. <br>  <br>  for the bridle, have you tried a hackamore? i know she doesn't like halters, but if you can desensitize her to them, she should go fine in a hackamore. some horses just don't like a bit in their mouth. <br>  <br>  for the girth, put it on the first hole. when she calms down, put it up one more hole and continue. when she reacts, just stop where you are and wait for her to calm down. and when i say stop where you are, i mean it literally. however if she kicks out at you, by all means, move. just start over again (make sure you have an open schedule for this. it may not take all day, or even an hour, but it'll take a lot less time if you're not rushing). don't overtighten it. what i do is put it up so the saddle won't slip and then tighten it again when you get into the arena. again, don't crank it up. only enough so that you won't slide off when riding. if you have to, stop every few minutes and tighten it very slowly. <br>  <br>  i know i said desensitize a lot, but that's the only way to get rid of her problems. and i'd have a trainer within arms-length at all times. one that you trust and have seen how they work with their horses. hopefully, if you stick with it, she'll be a lot better if not cured!|`|xvEJbqtfaa	Those are big problems! Here's what I would do.<br>  <br>  1. Girthy horses are a nightmare. You'll have to get it into her head that there's no way around it. Start by putting on the girth VERY loosely while you're tacking up. If she freaks, slap her on the shoulder and firmly say, "No." Don't put up with that stuff from her! Then, lead her outside the arena before tightening the girth again. If she bucks, slap her on the quarters, so you're telling her where she's wrong. Make sure to use your voice too. Then, go into the arena and tighten before mounting. Lastly, mount up and tighten again while you're on board. If she bucks are bites, turn her in a tight circle and then make her stand perfectly still before trying again. You can repeat if necessary.<br>  <br>  2. When she pulls, make sure the lead is loose. Otherwise, she'll panic and pull more. Just practice, and she should realize there's nothing wrong with being lead around. While putting on the bridle, make her head come below your shoulder. You can grab her crest and mane to direct her if you want; there are few nerves there. Don't immediately put on the bridle, take your time. If she protests too much, slap her on the lower neck and say something to her. Let her calm down before you try anything. Basically, just practice and praise.<br>  <br>  3. Try cantering from a walk firstly. Then reward her for following cues. Then, make sure you sit very deep in the trot before asking for the canter. Using your reins, angle her head to the outside. Give her a very firm squeeze with the outside leg. If she rises in the trot, pull her back. Get a slow, collected trot and try again. If she continues to do this after a couple tries. Make her freeze. Make a very quick stop, as to be clear she's in trouble, not getting a break. Back her up for quite a while in a straight line. Then make her hold still, and try again. Make sure to reward good behaviour.<br>  <br>  Repetition is everything, the memory of having to back up or being slapped will encourage her to behave.<br>  <br>  Also, remember that there's a big difference between and punishing slap and whipping or beating. Please don't use a crop as anything but a riding aid, not a weapon. Keep in mind the three second rule as well. After that time, she'll get confused on what you're correcting.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	With the girthy problem, if you tighten the girth all the way right off the bat, it could bug her.  what i've always done is tighten it enough to keep the saddle from falling off, then when i got to the arena tighten it a little more, then walk, then tighten, then walk, ect. as far as the bridle issue, it depends on what she is doing, i'm guessing she throws her head up in the air when you present it to her.  a friend of mine had a horse like this and what works for her is to give him a treat when the bit is pushed into his mouth at the same time.  if it's the ears, then try just taking a day off from riding and work solely on touching her ears, to playing with them, to being able to rub your finger in them without her flinching, try not to get mad at her, and by no means grab and hold onto her ear.  if she is breaking halters, try tying her with a ROPE halter and let her fight it out on her own.  the rope hlter will be much stronger than both a nylon and leather.  when you tie her, tie her to something solid, not something that can move and definately not cross ties.  as for cantering, what really helped for me with my own horse was to round pen or lunge him and get him to canter on cue there first.  it makes teaching him the same cue in saddle so much easier and less frustrating.  it sounds like shecould also be afraid of crops and such, she might really need a good sacking out.  a simple saddle pad rubbed and patted all over her body could do her a world of good.  my mother actually leaves wood shavings bags in with her babies and they all end up being easy to break and don't spook at anything.  if you do that though, make sure there aren't and staples on the bags.  good luck and i hope i helped with at least one problem.|`|BREi7qw7aa	ok here are some answers:<br>  1) im not sure how your barn works, and how you feel about disciplining, but cow kicking and bucking is definitely NOT ok. My approach is to have a crop in hand, and as soon as the horse tries to pull one, get after her, and give her a yank on her bridle/halter. Eventually, if you keep up with it, the horse will understand what is acceptable.<br>  2)Again, sounds like your horse gets away with alot. So if you are willing to punish her, try putting a chain over her nose (find a lead with a chain on the end and put it thru the halter and over the nose). When your horse misbehaves, give her a good jerk.If you dont agree with dicipline, your horse will take advantage of you.<br>  3)Make sure you carry a crop when your riding her. And remember:ask, tell, command. Squeeze once, then harder, and say loudly CANTER, and if she still isnt cantering, make her in the butt. If she trys to pull anything, be ready to jerk with the reins and give her another smack.<br>  Good luck, and remember: your in control!!|`|ZGiVn4MUaa	shes hyper u need to work her hard nd warm her up a long time to get the edge off her nd shes also lazy nd dont respect u by not listening to u rond pen her nd make her listen to u by maken her go around nd around switch directions make her stop nd face u watch for her giveing into u licking lips chewing ears flicking to ur voice nd commands|`|rBTxIbh0aa	well for problem 2 try putting a bridle with no bit on her and get a lead rope that hangs to the ground with a little extra length on it put the lead rope on her with the no bit bridle and just leave it on her for about a week or 2 her steping on the lead rope when shes walking will pull her head down and teach her that when she feels pulling on the rope it means she should stop and the no bit bridle on her all the time will get her more used to the idea of somthing bing on her head after that u should be able to move back to the bridle with the bit|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	1. Sounds like she might be a bit cold-backed. Any chance you could get a longer girth? If so then put the saddle on her back and do the girth up to the point where it is touching her but not tight. Enough that the saddle won't slip if she gets a fright but not enough that its really cinched up. Step away from the girth and talk to her, pat her or if she's really antsy just back away and leave her. when she has calmed down, go the next hole up and repeat. She may just be a horse that you need to take your time to saddle up. I have one the same. he's 18 and very grumpy when it comes to having his girth tightened.<br>  <br>  2. have you tried a bitless bridle? or a hackamore? Or maybe even riding her in a rope halter? (although you won't be able to jump in the last 2) The same horse I had that didn't like the girth HATES the bit.

XbQGyiT7aa	once you find your distance, look at a tree or something that will keep you on the line for your fence. and trust me, if you look up, your horse won't duck out, unless he's made a serious habit of it now. but it sounds like he only started doing it when you looked down, so i don't think that's the case. the weight and balance of your body is telling him "yes, we are going over this fence". by looking down, you're throwing both yourself and your horse out of whack. so again, just find a focus point and keep yourself straight. don't even think about him ducking out. he'll pick up on those vibes. also, every time you look down, kind of yell at yourself in your head to "look up, sit up and RIDE THAT FENCE!" just have confidence in yourself and your horse. if you need to, block out your trainer. if the yelling is taking away from your confidence, just tune it out and focus on what has to be done.|`|MBwln1m7aa	When you're jumping you should be looking ahead and thinking, planning where you're going next.<br>  When you're coming up to the jump you should be looking straight ahead.

The best thing to do is to focus on something on the other side of the ring across from the jump. This may sound weird, but it helps. Without a  horse, go out in the ring and jump over the jump. If you can. I mean, 2'9 is a stretch for me to jump on foot XD. But once you see it up close, it'll look a lot smaller from horseback. Have confidence, you know you can get over that jump! Don't even think about the jump, just focus on the landing.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	like you said, it's the weight of your head that throws him off.  you can look with your eyes without moving your head.  or you can think of keeping your chin Parallel with the ground at all times.  what could help with that is find something above and beond the jump and fix you eyes on it and let your horse do the rest.  at least until you are more comfortable with it.  it took me a looooong time to not look down, those are the three that really helped me.  good luck.|`|shKh9mnUaa	I used to have the same problem but instead of looking down I would look back right after going over a jump but I solved that problem by just reminding myself to look forward.

o93EwErKaa	As a breeder, I do not supplement with calcium during pregnancy or lactation.  Calcium has to be given in the right proportion to phosphorous and Vitamin D or you can cause an imbalance by just giving calcium.  I have always given a high quality puppy food to nursing dams and have never had a problem with eclampsia (low blood calcium).  My research has shown that supplementing calcium or giving too much calcium rich food can actually cause eclampsia during lactation.  Commercial preparations have the right balance of the nutrients so you don't have to worry about upsetting this balance.|`|Chxoncy7aa	Both are right.  I would not give it to every dog.

I'd also switch to a wet food and ditch the dry. Honestly, vets get very little nutritional training during their schooling and they know next to nothing about pet nutrition. <br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.<br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfedcats.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfedcats.org/</a> (Raw Fed Cats)<br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs/profile/" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs...</a> (Raw Dogs Livejournal Community [not just for dogs despite the name!], excellent raw feeding information on the profile page and overall helpful community for raw feeding questions)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html</a> (Myths About Raw Feeding)<br>  <br>  Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Why Cats Need Canned Food)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a> (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)<br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a> (The Dry Food Crisis)<br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a> (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)<br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to feline obesity.

If she does go potty outside, play with her then take her back in. <br>  <br>  When you take her back in, and she pees go right back out. When she goes outside, praise her. Take her 15 minutes after drinking water and every 2 hours in general (though for a smaller dog it might be 1 hour).|`|KxjUim7yaa	Do you have a crate? Put her in it when she comes in so that she will hold it until the potty break. Put her out for about 1/2 hour. Then bring her in. Stay out with her and praise her for being a good girl, if she is good. Maybe give a treat too. They love treats, and if they get one for going potty they will be more willing.Next potty break in 1 or 2 hrs. Clean spots with Nature's Miracle. Don't let her out of her crate unless you are watching her. If she starts to go take her out. You need to be persistent with a Dachshund.|`|ADb6CejTaa	I have three dachshund and potty training takes patience. When you take her back inside watch, she will give you certain cues that tells you she is looking to pee. Catch her right away, if she starts, tell her firmly NO and take her right back outside. This will take lots of repetition but she will eventually get the idea. As always praise her ALOT when she does go outside. None of my dogs even bark to let me know they need to go out. As puppies they would nose around the house looking for a spot and that was my cue to take them right outside.  Good Luck!!|`|Yyv4WQLiaa	my dach was difficult to potty train as well, just keep taking her out constantly the best times are when she wakes up, about 15 min after she eats or when she gets done playing, another thing i used to do is if i got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom i would also put my dog out, if your able to get a tie out that can be secured near the door and tie her out to do her business, it may be that she is distracted by you, mine would not go, if i was out there. keep watch out a window and when shes done let her back in. it may take a while everyone ive talked to says that dachs are a little on the hard side to potty train, if you want to train her to bark at the door when you get to the door bark before you let her out you will think its crazy but it worked for mine he now barks to be let out.|`|mRevWUxlaa	Is she being crated inside.... probably, right? Okay, I had a dachshund that did that to. Train her with treats and word associations. When you take her out, say "Go Potty" or whatever the "Potty" word is going to be. Then when she does, LAVISH HER with praise and a treat or two. If she wants to play, bring her back inside and watch her for the typical "nose to the floor sniffing" Take her back out. Crates are excellent to potty train though. If you need more help, Go to the local library or book store and find NEW BOOKS on training. Old books tend to still include corporal punishment which can open up a brand new world of trouble!!!! Good Luck!!!!|`|pvgwJwxvaa	do you have her on a leash when you take her outside?  she also needs to be on one inside and have it attached to you so she is constantly supervised.  when you take her out, walk her until she does her business and make sure you give her loads of praise.

2ORqOh51aa	I have found a crate is a really good technique. Your puppy will love the crate, think of it as his den and by instinct not want to soil it. It's ok to leave him in the crate for periods when you cannot watch him. When you can watch him, take him out when he begins stiffing around, or otherwise hinting he may have to go #2. <br>  <br>  When he finally does go outside, praise praise and more praise. <br>  <br>  I am sure you would not do this but rubbing his nose in his mess or spanking does not work. <br>  <br>  Good luck from an adoptive father of 2 Jack Russells.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	The command for poop is "go finish" and you tell your puppy to "go finish" until he does, and then praise him.  I am not sure why you are walking him around, that might be confusing him.  I would put a leash on and take him to the spot he is supposed to go potty and give him commands until he does.  I had a puppy that would hold his poop all day and then when my husband came home, they would go outside, and he would poop for him.  The bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, and they are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old, so hang in there.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.

Treats work well. If you are not able to constantly watch the puppy, you should put him in a crate until he can be trusted. As soon as you let him out of the crate he should go straight outside to potty. Remember lots of praise and treats.|`|lfKEHk66aa	get a dog trainer|`|UEHsqSaTaa	Every time he poops put him in the cage. As soon as he does it. And then show him the poop and scream no.<br>  <br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  SOLUTIONS TO HOUSE TRAINING PROBLEMS. <br>  <br>  There's no such thing as an almost housebroken dog. Either he is or he isn't. Saying a dog is almost housebroke is like saying your wife is almost pregnant. When a dog is housebroken he never uses the house for his toilet.<br>  <br>  Many people do not understand why their dog does not know what to do when taken outside. Just turning a dog out in the back yard by himself a few times a day is not the way to house train a dog. <br>  <br>  Merely taking him outside also does not mean he knows what he's being taken outside for. The biggest problem between the dog and the owner is that the dog would love to please but he doesn't know how to communicate with you.<br>  <br>  Housebreaking in theory is very simple. It is finding a means of preventing the puppy from doing his duties in the house and only giving him the opportunity to do it outside. It also means that the dog learns to communicate with you about going when told to go and about letting you know when he has to go outside. <br>  <br>  A dog is a creature of habit and because he learns by association, if his training is consistent he will quickly learn there is no other place to relieve himself other than outdoors.<br>  <br>  We take advantage of a very natural instinct of the dog - his desire to keep his sleeping quarters clean - i.e. not to mess his bed. We offer a dog a den in the form of a dog crate. This becomes his bed that he cannot get out of. If the dog crate is the right size he will not soil it. Puppies may not initially like it (some will scream like a raped ape) but within a few days they will accept it without a problem.<br>  <br>  Dogs are and always have been den and pack animals. Canines naturally and instinctively prefer the shelter of a den. In the wild the young are raised in dens. They spend a great part of their first year very close to their den. In homes, dogs often choose their den. They will get under a desk, behind a couch, in a closet, etc. <br>  <br>  A dog crate is a perfect, natural bed for the dog and a safe, natural spot to put the pet whenever necessary for the dog's safety or the owner's peace of mind<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are appalled by the idea of confining him to a cage, let me dispel any idea of cruelty. You are actually catering to a very natural desire on the part of the dog. In his wild state, where does a dog bed down for the night? Does he lie down in the middle of an open field where other animals can pounce on him? No! He finds a cave or trunk of a tree where he has a feeling of security - a sense of protection. The correct use of a crate merely satisfies the dog's basic need to feel safe, protected, snug and secure.<br>  <br>  Now with this said. Some puppies will scream their living heads of - some for a couple of days when you put them in the crate. The question you need to answer is "would I rather get the dog used to the crate or would I rather clean up dog crap on my rug"? An easy question to answer. <br>  <br>  Pups do get over the fact that screaming gets them no where - as long as you ignore it and DO NOT TAKE THEM OUT OF THE CRATE WHEN THEY ARE SCREAMING. If if bother you - put the crate in the basement or the garage or leave the house for a few hours. Trust me - it will stop when it gets tired. Those who give in create their own problems.<br>  <br>  Small pups will naturally sleep 15 to 18 hours a day. This is normal. They quickly learn that the crate means taking a nap.<br>  <br>  I keep a plastic bowl of all-natural dog treats near my crate. The liver biscotti that we sell are perfect. They don't smell and they don't get moldy with age. Every time I put a pup in the crate I give a "CRATE" command and toss 3 or 4 liver biscotti's into the crate. It gives the pup a nice reason to go in. You will be surprised how quickly they expect to get a treat when they go into the crate. Going in becomes a positive experience<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As a dog ages and learns I will give the "CRATE" command before I toss the treats in. I will expect the dog to go in on their own because I just told them to do it. This exercise is the beginning of teaching your dog to go to his crate when people come to the house. Dogs that bark and act stupid when they hear the door bell need to be told to go to their crate. This is how that training is started. <br>  <br>  When thinking of the size of a crate needed for your dog, think small. Think den not condo! The use of too large a crate for a puppy will encourage the pet to use a small portion of it for a bed and the remainder as a relief station!<br>  <br>  The puppy should only be allowed to relieve itself out doors. It is OK to place the crate in the bedroom of the person who will be responsible for that early morning trip. This is a temporary situation. I am not a fan of a dog sleeping in the bedroom. It often causes adult dog to develop issues of dominance. Once the pup is old enough to sleep the night through without having to go out|`|c33225fb5582a75283d2b867e82899e5aa	Monitor his BM habits.

The ear flush was done under anesthesia with my Yorkie and didn't do any good.  I don't know if anesthesia was necessary for the ear flush alone because we were doing another procedure at the same time.  The ear infection would always return after the meds were finished.  I switched her to a grainless food Taste of the Wild and starting using a product called Zymox with hydrocortisone.  They sell it at www.amazon.com for less than $15.00 with shipping.  Read the reviews.    This is the only product used that the ear infection did not return, but I am sure she was also helped by the grainless diet.  It's been over a year now and no ear infections.

IrdZKYT3aa	This sounds like a water quality issue, but you said all was well in that department.  Check again to make sure though.<br>  What's the temp?  Try gradually upping it to about 82-84 degrees, this can effectively induce a fever and help kill and prevent the spread of disease.<br>  Try adding some freshwater aquarium salt, this can help relieve stress as well as increase the slime coat which can be damaged in fights, poor water and from many other disease.  It's great in helping to stop and preventdiseasee.<br>  The white on  the tail cold be a fungus.  This is unlikely to be the main problem and may in fact be a secondary infection.<br>  Does anyone have spots?  Little white dots any where on their body?  This is ich, and it can result in the flashing behavior you mentioned above, fungus is a common seconary stage of this parasite.   This seems to be  a very likelly diagnosis, meds are easy to find and a must in this situation.  Salt and heat are a great addition to the meds you'll need.<br>  I would definitely up the temp and add some aquarium salt.  It can help with most infections, help stop or slow spreading and relieve stress.  Watch for more signs or describe any other symptoms for a better idea of what may be wrong with them.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|AraBfesHaa	The trembling sounds like the shimmies.

CdRlOsnyaa	A turtle with puffy, swollen or closed eyes is not uncommon and something that you should familiarize yourself with treating. The first step is to determine what is causing the problem with the eyes.<br>  If the turtle is experiencing problems with a single eye, it is most likely due to an injury, be it self-inflicted, scraped or poked by another turtle or possible done by something in the habitat (corner of the basking area, stick, etc). If both eyes are affected then, then you need to look into health-related problems.<br>  <br>  One of the most common causes for turtles to have swollen, puffy, closed or red eyes, is related to water quality. In some species, a high concentration to chlorine can cause them to have adverse reactions. Typically, this is confined to keeping the eyes closed, some rubbing of the eyes and maybe some twitching of the head. This usually goes away within a few hours if left alone. If you notice that your turtle does have a reaction to chlorinated water, either dechlorinate the water before placing the turtle in the water, or let the water stand for about 24 hours before introducing the turtle.<br>  <br>  If the turtle is having a reaction to water quality, then the first thing you are going to need to look at is your filtration. The filter might be clogged or is unable to meet the demands and a larger or otherwise better filter may be needed to assist in improving the quality of the water. Frequent water changes would benefit your turtle and would assist you in determining if this is indeed the problem.<br>  <br>  Vitamin A deficiency is another common problem. If your turtle is not eating a varied diet which is rich in vitamins or is not being offered a supplement, then this may very well be the problem your turtle is having. <br>  <br>  If your turtle has an infection of the eyes, then prompt attention is needed. Keep in mind that not all eye infections are actually problems within the eye itself. It may also be in an infection within the body and is simply manifesting itself in the eyes in the appearance of swelling.

wpgbN3K6aa	Necessary vaccines will vary depending on where you live and the prevalence of the diseases in your area.  Rabies is required by law in most areas, and a DHLPP (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parainfluenza, and parvovirus) vaccine or some variation of it (some places give DHPP, DAPP or other) is almost always recommended.  Other vaccines are recommended for dogs that are in situations that put them at high risk for those viruses.  For instance, if your dog goes with you to the pet store, dog park, training classes, boarding kennels, grooming, or anywhere other dogs frequent, it is a good idea to vaccinate for bordetella (kennel cough).  If your dog is the outdoor type and spends time at parks, lakes, hiking, etc.  you should consider the leptospirosis and rattlesnake vaccines.  Other vaccines such as lyme may be recommended in your area as well.  The best idea would be to call several vets in your area and ask them for price quotes and recommendations as to what vaccines would really benefit him.  For his physical exam, expect anywhere from $30-80 and for vaccines at least another $50-100.  You should also have him tested for heartworms, placed on heartworm/flea prevention, and screened for intestinal parasites.  If he is not neutered, make an appointment to have that done ASAP!  Talk to your vet about the benefits of neutering such as decreased incidence of cancers, decreased aggression, less tendancy to run away and wander, decreased/elimination of scent marking...etc...<br>  <br>  Also, if you are only 11 years old, your parents should be responsible for making sure that Max stays current on his vaccines, heartworm prevention, etc. regardless of whether you have money or not.  If you are supposed to "take care of him", then great you can pay your parents back.  But, if the dog needs shots now, and it sounds like he does, then your parents ultimately need to be the responsible pet owners and make sure the dog is taken care of.  Otherwise, they are not teaching you very good responsibility by just letting the dog stay unvaccinated until you can "get the money".|`|YTXj2uMHaa	The actual cost will depend on the weight of the dog, and the vet, as well as what all the vet will do. Hopefully this is not the first set of vaccinations the dog has gotten. I would suggest calling your vet for a quote.<br>  Here's a list of the vaccinations that are necessary, as well as the interval that they should be given. You'll also find what each shot is good for and what they prevent.<br>  <a href="http://www.petadvice.com.au/vaccinations-for-dogs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petadvice.com.au/vaccinations...</a>|`|pvgwJwxvaa	core vaccines include distemper, parvo, hepatitis, and rabies.  not all vaccines are necessary (lepto, corona, bordetella, lyme, etc).<br>  <br>  in addition to core vaccines, your dog needs a fecal exam, heartworm test, and heartworm prevention.  <br>  <br>  a vets office can give you an estimate over the phone.|`|xEGB2rQ9aa	your vet will know the exact shots that are needed.  also you could call the vet and ask how much it would cost.  furthermore it is VERY important that you get the dog vaccinated.  parvo is a really big killer of unvaccinated dogs. also you need to get him on hearworm preventative A.S.A.P|`|KuUx34hCaa	Call a Vet in your area & they can tell you right down to the penny Good food is the bset thing you can do for your dog|`|gwUMipsUaa	Your vet will know which vaccines to give.

You can pay your parents back.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well it really depends on where you live and the laws there.  You would benefit to call around to your area vets and see what they charge and when they recommend and at what times(weeks) They will do this for free.  Then you need to decide which vet to use.  The cheapest vet is not always a good choice.  I like to go to the vets and sit in the waiting area and watch how the staff treats their customers.  Also notice if the place looks clean.  Our recent puppy has had a new puppy exam, $80.00 And shots so far have been over 300.00 and her spay is going to be $200.00.  I don't know if that helps you where you live, it might be cheaper.

oT71QN8Raa	...how exactly do you know that these two cats are purebreds?  If you got them a breeder, its not a very good breeder since they typically don't sell their kittens unaltered.  Aside from that...if you bought them from a petstore, you are just askin' for trouble breeding these two.  Like PrettyKitty said, God knows what could go wrong.  You really need to rethink this.  <br>  <br>  You also can't just toss two cats together and expect them to leap into each others paws in a passionate embrace.  Cats don't tend to like other strange cats.  It takes time to grow accustomed to each other.  <br>  <br>  I will not lie, when I first started coming on this site, I found it horribly rude and cruel for some of these people to yell at other people for wanting to breed their animals...however, I have learned over the past couple months just why backyard breeders are hated so much.  You can't just start willy-nilly throwing cats together.  Its not right.  Seriously, rethink this decision.  If you decide during the rethinking that you absolutely will go through with this, make sure you go to the nearest shelter, look about 6 kittens in the eyes and tell them you are going to kill them.  This way they'll have someone to blame.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	it takes time she needs to get used to him first and be in heat|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Do you and your friend have any Idea how many cats and kittens there are in rescues, shelters in the wild that want to be in some nice warm home. and you are planning on bringing more into the world.<br>  Please get your cat  (cats) fixed so that there is less kittens being born<br>  <br>  Mine is|`|JUe1E0Pkaa	Candles and a romantic dinner for them both, play freak me by silk in the background<br>  <br>  xD|`|pvgwJwxvaa	if you dont know what to do then you dont need to be breeding!  if your friend wants a kitten then tell her to adopt one!|`|K3jcdkveaa	you have to wait till she's in heat . i think ..|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	There is alot more to breeding than putting two cats together.  Have these cats been tested for blood compatibility and genetic deficiencies or do you plan on producing possibly defective kittens?  Do you and your friend have homes lined up for the possibly 14 kittens the cat could have?  The average litter is 3-5 but it's not unheard of to have lots more. Do you and your friend have money to pay for vet care for the kittens till they are at least 16 weeks old (you can't safely send them to new homes sooner than that)?  What if the female needs a c-section?  That will cost about $350.  She will also need regular vet checks during her pregnancy.  Do either of these cats have any show titles?  What does your breeding mentor think?  Are you and your friend prepared to offer a lifetime return policy on the kittens in case an owner can't keep it anymore?<br>  <br>  Ethical breeders take all the things I mentioned into consideration.  They don't make a profit from breeding because all the proceeds from kittens being sold goes back into their breeding program to cover vet bills, show fees,etc.  Good breeders never breed until they have a full waiting list which can cover homes for all the kittens.  If you don't follow that protocol, you are a common backyard breeder responsible for the DAILY deaths of 10,000+ cat and kittens in shelters who are the victims of pet overpopulation.|`|ZQS2Q6cXaa	first of all, and hopefully you know this already, the female has to be in heat, thus she must be unfixed for that to happen. you're male will not breed her if he is neutered aswell. if the female is unfixed, you must wait until she is in heat, which only happens a few times a year. you need to know what your doing though, and i really dont recommend it, it puts her female and the future kittens in a great deal of danger for an inexperienced person to breed her.|`|lwkv7pJBaa	get them a nice room at the hyatt, cover the bed with roses, get a nice champagne bottle, light a few candles, and let the inevitable happen..If that doesnt work take him/her to a vet and see if they can offer any solutions.|`|JMnu0rBiaa	You have to bring your Tom cat around when the Female cat is in heat.

pcCfHYeSaa	preheat your oven to 325. Put four cups of whole wheat flour in a bowl. Also put a half cup of cornmeal, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons of veggie. oil, and 1 and 1/4 cups water in the bowl.

ejj2N3uaaa	In general, saddlebreds are not your "typical" jumper breed. They're not usually built for it. However, if the one you've found isn't the average show saddlebred (5 gaited or otherwise) and has suitable conformation for jumping, you can always try it. There are individuals within every breed that will surprise you. If I had to bet between a saddlebred and a TB or WB or something for being a good jumper, sight unseen, I'd go with the other breed--but I wouldn't be surprised if I was proven wrong in some cases.<br>  <br>  With that said, my jumper is 1/4 Saddlebred (3/4 Arabian...also not your typical breed). He's not built like a NSH (we did show the Arabian circuit in HP for awhile, successfully, but never saddleseat like a lot of the ASbs). He loves to jump and is super quick, fast, and athletic. We only do the 2'6 and 3'0 jumpers (I have no desire to go further--he might be able to) but he's been very successful. I've also ridden a 17.3h gelding who evented Prelim level and I believe he had some Saddlebred in him. <br>  <br>  Conformation, training, and attitude is more important than just pedigree/bloodlines, so if this Saddlebred has more going for him than the QH, I'd say go with him.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	you can't tell a good jumper from their breed.<br>  it depends more on their conformation and physical ability.<br>  i've seen some decent saddlebred jumpers as well as decent QH jumpers, but i've also seen very poor ones in both breeds. <br>  it just depends on the horse really and how you train them to reach their potential.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	Any breed of horse can be a good jumper. Just go test the horses over some jumps and see for yourself.|`|Dd7jx9uMaa	i think either would b good, just the way its trained will efect it|`|K4UDKZ5laa	What have you heard about the training to do the other 2 gaits?<br>  <br>  Addition:<br>  Ok yes but if he is an english prospect then he would of not been trained to gait but not every ASB is trained to gait even if it is a saddle seat horse.  They have to be built correctly to do it.  Can't make a ballerina a line backer.|`|BREi7qw7aa	you dont just know from the breed. try taking her over caveletti and small jumps and see her form. You really dont know until you try.|`|KeQOHakpaa	any horse can jump, breed doesn't matter. as long as the horse has some natural talent and enjoys doing it then it has no problem. so, you'd have to go see and ride the saddlebred to see if it was a good jumper or not.|`|YtBzRAxMaa	Saddlebreds typically have short canon bones which makes them not a great choice for upper level show jumping.

QV6swGUMaa	no guppies are way to cool for that blood worms is the way to go man.|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	No, African dwarf frogs aren't very quick and probably wouldn't be able to catch a guppy.  You should just feed frozen blood worms.  If you have a 5-10 gallon you could have a few guppies.  Just make sure you get males, or else they can quickly overpopulate a tank.  You will have to feed the fish and frogs separately or else the fish will eat all the food.  Feed the frogs by using turkey baster and putting the food right by them.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	They like feeder pellets|`|sBNjmsbuaa	No|`|v4YxLX9Daa	jerk....|`|SOxdyWQOaa	no try blood worms<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  17 years experience with fish
39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	Frozen blood worms.  A package is around $3-5 and will last a long time.  You just pop a square out into a little bowl and thaw it in some tank water.  It's easiest to use like a turkey baster or something like that to squirt the blood worms to the bottom right by the frogs.  They kind of randomly lunge at what they think is food - it's a lot of hit and miss with them.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	blood worms|`|gTethcOAaa	Anything frozen and small should be good.<br>  Brine Shrimp<br>  Blood Worms
rWcKYyiyaa	You can change your water as often as you like during bad water condition times.  If this is a new tank you want to let it cycle somewhat  though to establish good bacteria and in this case I would let it go as much as you can.  If you already have a good bio source for beneficial bacteria in the tank or filter then change the water every day if you have to until it gets better.  Of course you still have to find the source.  Usually overfeeding is the problem so stay on that track for a while.  What are you using for growing good bacteria in the tank? (bio matter)|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Is this a new aquarium, or has it been running for a while?<br>  <br>  The nitrates mean the cycle is at its end, or that nitrates are found naturally in your tap water. Did you test your untreated tap water?<br>  <br>  Once the tank is established weekly partial water changes of about 25% should be enough to keep nitrates in check.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	how high are they? .20 is as high as you want them to get. you don't have to worry if they are .20 or lower. <br>  <br>  live Plants will help keep it down.
EJpiaCMQaa	I wouldn't say he's permanently scared of humans, but the chasing behavior by your brother is causing the parakeet a good deal of anxiety.  The more you can keep your brother away from this parakeet, the better.  You still have the ability to tame the parakeet, but make sure no other people or pets are around.  You want the bird's full attention.  You need to form a bond with the parakeet so that it trusts you.  Start by talking to it and trying to get the bird on your finger.  It may take some time, but be patient and persistent.  Eventually, your parakeet will hop onto your finger.  Then you can start getting him comfortable outside the cage.  Offer your parakeet some of his favorite treats and toys.  He will become tame if he's not constantly harrassed by your brother.  <br>  <br>  Here is more information on taming parakeets:<br>  <a href="http://www.petbudgie.com/taming" rel="nofollow">http://www.petbudgie.com/taming</a>

XTDeAfTqaa	If you have the pup AKC registered and shot records that will help but since you don't have it micro-chipped that could be a problem. Luckily you have two witnesses that can identify your puppy.<br>  If you have any pictures of you with the Puppy then you have a case to make. Call the Police. <br>  Good luck on getting your puppy back!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Call the cops and have them come with you when you go get the dog.<br>  <br>  How did the dog escape?<br>  <br>  By the way, certain "breeders" scope out dogs inside of fences and take them.  Don't leave a dog outside without you outside with it.<br>  <br>  Edit: The AKC papers will have you as the rightful owner of the dog.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	My vets takes pictures of our dogs every time we come there and the picture goes in her computer and our dogs/puppies pictures print out on our receipts.  You can take something like that with you to the cops to help prove that this puppy is yours.

Unless you can prove she has the dog,  you can't even get started proving he is yours.  Sorry.  I would keep watching her house though.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Call the cops.  And if you get the dog back, get it microchipped.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Tell the cops make a report.|`|FXLLY4Hjaa	well you need proof to call the cops maybe try a home visit go to her house and ask her nicely where your dog ran off to and if she coulld show you the way. While talking to her get a sneak peek in her house if you see nothing maybe ask to come in and chat. Look around try to find your dog or evidence that she has your dog. Then when you have solid evidence call the cops.|`|1dNQTo6Zaa	Call the cops. <br>  She is probably going to stud him with one of her dogs if she is a breeder. Thats easy money for her becasue usually you have to pay to have a stud come to your female. <br>  Either that or shes trying to sell him.<br>  <br>  Either that or find out where she lives. Trace the call.|`|o4NarYVoaa	call the cops!|`|2l7lbcJWaa	I think you should go to her house (without calling) and ask her very politely where she thinks your dog might have run off to. Then you can see if she invites you in, or acts suspicious or anything to make you believe she really does have the dog. If she acts that way, the only thing you can really do is watch her house for a while to see if you see any sign of the dog. Once you see it you can call the police. OR if you really are sure she has the dog, tell the cops you SAW her with it. Thats the only way you're gonna get them to search her house.
2ORqOh51aa	How old is she? <br>  <br>  If she is an adult and never behaved like this before you better take her to a Vet, immediately. <br>  <br>  If she is a puppy she needs more attention, take her for a walk, ect for her to blow off some steam.<br>  <br>  You might want to check to see if you have a fruit fly infestation as well....... just kidding. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	If she is really acting out of character, go see the vet.<br>   Sometimes dogs do odd things that seem out of place when they are having a certain kind fo seizure.<br>  <br>   Seizures can be caused by a lot of different things, so you really want to have her looked at if what she is doing doesn't seem like normal dog stuff.  You may need a consult with a veterinary neurologist if it keeps happening - but for now, I would have the vet see if there is any reason they can see as to what this behaviour is about.|`|P5CLeokmaa	lol<br>  <br>  theres nothing "wrong" with her i don't believe, i would just make see if she does anything else unusually. <br>  <br>  She is just play full.<br>  <br>  My little puppy i have right now she will pounce all around her treat and jump back and jump forward..<br>  <br>  i thought she was hurt, and i was freaking out, but as much as i cna tell its normally<br>  and when i had Blackie, and Jessie (labs) they acted the same way.|`|AA11812232	She needs some constructive play or walks to get rid of her excess energy.

D1beU6MPaa	Hi Gabi,<br>  What you need to do is call the vet before they close. Tell them the situation and ask what they think. If they think the puppy needs to be seen today, ask them if they would stay until your husband gets home with the car. If they won't, then find an after hours vet and take the puppy in when your husband gets home. If you are established with your vet, they will most likely wait for you. Honestly, from your description, the pup needs to be seen today. Good luck|`|gwUMipsUaa	She may have gotten into poison.  Take her to the vet NOW.  This sounds more like poisoning.|`|JCozkN7faa	I agree with BOB! Your puppy needs to go to the vet now not tomorrow!<br>  <br>  Poor pup!

AA11812232	You need to go to the house, ask to speak to the parents. Tell them to their faces what you find disturbing. Ask them if they agree with their son and if they would like you to stop watching their dogs. Hand them the responsibility of their son. If no one calls him to the floor on this he will continue to be rude and ignorant. Don't let anyone step on you like that.|`|o4NarYVoaa	I would tell her what he said, then ask her if she feels the same way.<br>  <br>  Depending on what she says, you can make your decision on whether or not you will dog sit again.|`|2ORqOh51aa	Your intended response would be very appropriate. The son is very immature based on your story.  You are a fine person to help these dogs. You went above and beyond and if you enjoy doing that, continue to visit them in the presence of the parents.   Their son has issues. He can deal with those, you can hold your head up and continue enjoying life.|`|nd30LQhlaa	no your right when she calls tell her that and if she says shes sorry accept it unless you want to her it from her son...thats very rude of him to say that,they sould be greatful for your help.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Perhaps the son is mentally ill.  Pay him no mind, but do tell the parents what happened.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I would say something to the mother about her sons behavior and insulting remarks.  I house sit for people's dogs and I would be horrified if anyone accused me of neglecting their dog.  I would ask them if they took the dogs to the vet and if the vet found signs of abuse.  It is possible that the son has a drug problem and stole things from his parents to pay for the drugs and he is blaming you for this.  I would tell the mother, she may not have any idea that her son insulted you in such a way.  I certainly wouldn't care for their dogs ever again, let them board them if they are going to be so insulting.|`|AA12205301	I wouldn't even deal with the son. I would talk to the owners and let them know just what you said about not feeling comfortable after being accused of neglect.  Let them know that you took care of the dogs above and beyond what they asked of you.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-He is an idiot!!!  Don;t let it bother you at all!  Might want to tell his/your parents what he said and let them know you will not be able to help them out next time they are out of town due to his comments.  Soudns like you did an excellent job.  Ignore him!!!!!|`|2l7lbcJWaa	Were you dog-sitting for the parents or the son? If its the parents then you are making way to big a deal about this and shouldn't even waste your time thinking about the son's rude comment. Unless of course, HE is the one paying you, then you should stop dog-sitting for him. Other wise, it has nothing to do with him and you're being dramatic. If what the child said hurt your feeling that terribly then tell on him.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	If the parents have not pressed charges for you for stealing,, or if they haven't called you for the dogs.. Not sure why you care what a kid has to say, considering the parents are the ones giving your the money not the kid. <br>  <br>  Either you continue to watch the dogs or you don't.
09e41Hdwaa	Chewy, birds can't get fleas!<br>  <br>  It sounds like your bird is just preening.  Watch its water and if you see bugs in it, it might be mites.  If it is, take it to an avian vet.  Don't buy the stuff sold at pet stores to treat them.|`|1gDTiPVyaa	First, go to the symptom checker at www.birds-online.de. There are descriptions of symptoms of mites and some pictures. Since your bird's not tame, you may not be able to tell for sure and if you're really worried you might still want to call a vet for professional help. The symptom checker can help you decide how worried you need to be. He could just be growing in new feathers and you might have seen part of a pin (new) feather. Impossible for us to know over the net and without pics. Birds preen and scratch a lot when they're not sleeping or eating so that by itself may not mean anything. I repeat, if you're REALLY worried, call the vet--at the latest--first thing in the morning. <br>  <br>  The mite sprays from the pet stores are usually too weak to do any good at all--don't waste your money on them. The mite boxes can actually be dangerous, too--don't buy them. The normal chemical bug killers like Raid, and the stuff that's usually safe for dogs and cats, is too harsh and will kill or injure birds--please don't give in to the temptation to use those either. <br>  <br>  If you suspect mites and find some evidence of them everything you need to know about how to start is at the website I listed earlier. If you do clean the cage and the surrounding area, whether you use mild soap and water, vinegar and water or the diluted bleach solution some recommend, be sure that you rinse thoroughly and then let it dry. <br>  <br>  Hoping you're just being a little paranoid--but it's not really a bad thing. ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Yr4eBnXlaa	You definitely need to take this poor little budgie to the vet's.  Something is wrong and it needs to be dealt with right away.  Don't take chances with your bird's health by trying to treat it yourself.|`|P0p2p4utaa	Birds get mites which are kinda like fleas, you can get sprays for that from any pets shop or even walmart.

Weather it's flea's or mites- he's too Small 4 you to deal with. For a reasonable cost- the vet. will help him. He could Die- with out the Help . You will have to Clean his WHOLE CAGE and Toys, with Palmolive (dish-soap) in Very Hot Soapy water, let the soap site on the cage and toys @ least 5 minutes, before rinsing- this will "Kill ALL Flea's and Mites ". You WILL have to clean the area his cage was in- and treat it for Flea's or Mites - as well- so he does NOT get re-Infested. <br>  <br>         I hope this helps.      Chewy and HipHop xx
3sB49YNnaa	Yes and no! Guinea pigs can live in an aquarium but people can live in a prison cell.  The fact that they can doesn't make it desirable! Aquaria are a poor choice for housing for a variety of reasons.  First, all but the most enormous are too small and second, they have poor ventilation.  Ventilation problems mean the bedding doesn't dry naturally and ammonia builds up.  This is bad for both the pig since it hurts its lungs and for you since it makes your room smell!|`|Gwl9AeJ1aa	yes|`|zzbyelzkaa	Yes they can, just as long as you have bedding in the aquarium and a lid if it's a small one, which the guinea pig could get out of. I kept mine in a huge storage container, and he did great!|`|UBwWBiLTaa	Yes they can, just as long as you have bedding in the aquarium and a lid if it's a small one, which the guinea pig could get out of.|`|tGmwqtr5aa	No that isn't a very good choice.

tMlwcim8aa	I would recommend a maximum of five. Shrimp are smaller and able to adapt more easily to smaller areas than other inhabitants and can and do live in groups in the wild.

fPLv0QrSaa	During training, keep your dog on a leash so you can correct any bad behaviors. Teach sit and stay. When someone comes up to see your dog, have her sit and stay. If she doesn't, don't let her see the person. She will soon learn that she has to sit and stay to greet people. As for her jumping on you, I wouldn't do that right away. If you really want to do it, make sure she has her sit and stay down pat. Then, teach her a command that means to come up on you. Only let her do it after you give the command. This is very important. If she runs across the yard to greet you, she will still needs to sit and stay before you release her to come up.|`|g3IXprk9aa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  I love Boxers. My family has raised them and my boyfriend and I have owned them before. They are GREAT dogs. They are really loving and friendly dogs. People get scared because of their size but I've never met a mean Boxer. They are also EXTREMELY smart, which makes them easy to train.<br>  <br>  What we did was walk into our Boxer, so say he was going to jump on me, I'd walk into him, like push my knee into him (it doesn't hurt them) DON'T give them eye contact, when you give them eye contact that shows you are paying attention and accepting them. You could also just turn your back as soon as they go up to jump on you and ignore them and walk away. They are looking for attention, so the more you can do to ignore them and have them on the ground the better.<br>  <br>  That is probably the most common technique. You could also try to teach with word commands like telling him/her down and then once her butt is on the ground hand it a treat.<br>  <br>  There is a ton of other techniques that you could do, you could try to go to dog based training sites and stuff and see what you can find. Hopefully my information helped out a little bit, good luck and all the best! :-)|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	yes that will confuse her, dogs dont have the ability to decide when it is ok to do something that they are sometimes allowed to do. if you dont want her jumping you need to make sure she knows its NEVER ok to jump. if you want her to give you kisses, go down to her level|`|okAYAGvXaa	Good luck :)))<br>  Especially with a boxer :)|`|BNNzCqhIaa	It is instinct for a happy excited do to want to jump and kiss you all over but it isn't the best first impression for strangers esp. non-dog strangers. As much as you love getting kisses from your girl when you walk in the door (I understand completely) it has to become a never okay kind of habit. When we enter the house our overly excited dog runs up to us and we turn around back to her. Only until she sits do we greet her back with love and pats. If she jumps when we give her attention we turn back around until she associates attention with sitting (calm behavior). You can also reinforce this with treats. You will still get all the loving you look forward to and she looks forward to but in a more behaved and controlled manner (something important for larger breed dogs and all dogs in general) Good luck!|`|AEnIE31taa	yes it gives the dog mixed signals like say you were sitting on the coach I said get  up now sit back down see you don't know if you are allowed to sit or to stand up.  You pay no attention just turn your back towards them with your arms folded up this will work but do not give in|`|GW7UJFp2aa	youhave to teach it when its young or you have no hope|`|x8Vgu6acaa	You need to teach her NEVER to jump on people.  Dogs don't have the capability to understand "sometimes".  <br>  <br>  Wait until you are all dressed up to go out and your muddy boxer jumps on you to give you kisses.  Then tell me you are OK with letting her jump on you.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	If you want her not to jump on other people, then it is not ok to allow her to jump on you. Here's what you should do: when she jumps up against you, turn your back and ignore her, don't even say "off". When you leave the house, ignore her. When you come back in, ignore her until she has settled down. Then call and give attention. Bend down to her level, do not let her jump. Also ask visitors to ignore her at first and later on they can give attention if the want to. Very important to follow these rules and to be consistent, especially with a boxer.

UAF8Zxzaaa	It's a bit rude on his part to not ask first. Some dogs shed a little bit and most people who don't own a dog don't want other people with dogs getting fur and so forth all over their stuff. Especially if you were to have friends with allergies- it would be a pain to have to worry about if you ever gave someone a ride somewhere. If he didn't have his own car it would be more rude on your part to never let him bring the dog with in the car. If you're not comfortable with having his dog in your car, that boundary needed to be set.|`|AA12208241	If you don't want the dog in the car it's your right to say no.

Bt1D1wWuaa	I am a big advocater for crate training!  There is a huge misconception about crate training and people think it's cruel.  That is so far from the truth! It is ideal for potty training and it helps them stay out of trouble until they get used to what's expected from him/her....plus, they come to realize that the crate is "their space/bedroom" and actually enjoy going in there even if they don't have to.  Sometimes when dogs just want to be left alone, they will go in there and kick back just like humans do when they go to their bedrooms to relax.  If you're interested in crate training here is what I did for both dogs I have owned since being an adult. <br>  When I was working and got a new pup. I made sure I took her out for a walk for at least 15 - 20 minutes before I left for work and the minute I got home, I took her out for another 15 - 20 walk. I was home within 8-1/2 hrs so that was the longest she stayed in the crate during the day. She had free roam of the home while I was there and I made sure to take her out about every 2-3 hours afterward. Then at night I would obviously take her out just before bedtime and bring the crate into my room next to my bed and she would sleep in there and be fine until morning. After about 2 months, I let her out of the crate at night and she was fine and then at about 4 months, I was able to let her stay at home without crating her and she was fine and fully potty trained. Please remember it is essential to make sure your dog gets some exercise especially if it is being crate trained. So you may want to take longer walks or walk more often.  Also, the crate should be large enough for your dog to stand up and just barely touching the top and it should be long enough for your dog to lie down, fully extended with only a few inches in front and behind him/her. The only thing I had in her crate was a nice comfy dog bed along with 1 or 2 bones (I used Nyla bones so I wouldn't have to worry about them choking or getting thirsty when nobody is home).   Another "pro" to this method is they rarely ever do their "business" in their crate!  Only one time did one my dogs have an accident and it was when he had to poop.  He must of put his rear up against the crate, cause the poop was actually outside the crate. Another advantage was neither dog got into things they weren't suppose to like the garbage can or chewing up things (couches, rugs, shoes etc.) and I don't mean only when they are crated.  This helped afterward when they were able to let out on their own.  One last thing is that your dog does not have to be a puppy to be crate trained so I say go for it but again, it's your choice!|`|T1sQd6A8aa	Well... You could... Anyways, um ya.... It's ok but,... any who.. Hope that helped!|`|sMBuotwZaa	I think crate training is great if you are going to be a dog owner. Some people are lucky enough to have areas they can section off to use for house training and "safe" zones for their dogs.  <br>  But for people who do not have that option, crate training is great.  It provides the dog with its own "den" to live in and sleep in.  This means they won't be likely to go to the bathroom in their crate.  It also provides a safe secure place to put your dog if they aren't comfortable around strangers, are prone to chewing and getting into things when they aren't/can't be supervised, and also a safe place to be if they are fearful of storms.<br>  <br>  Also having a dog who is content and happy in a crate it provides you with a safe way to transport your dog on trips, to the vet, and on visits to family.  It keeps the dog safe, and keeps you safe because you are less likely to become distracted.<br>  <br>  I think Crate Training is a great thing!|`|gVQ6es5Taa	He is too old to crate train now really, if he is not used to it. You are mean't to start when they are tiny pups. It is not natural for dogs to be caged. <br>  <br>  We decided to try it with my new puppy because we had a brand new house and he chewed alot. But he HATED it, and I regret doing it because he howled all night and I got very stressed and angry with him because I couldn't sleep or stand to see him sad. We gave it up in the end. <br>  <br>  The only benefit I can say it gave is that he is good at being left alone and amusing himself, as he slept alone while he was in the crate. But as your dog is two already he will be set in his ways. <br>  <br>  Don't bother with it, you are better getting an outdoor big run if he needs restraining.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	Ok, after reading so many different ideas on crate training I decided to answer.  Crate training your dog is not just about potty training them.  The crate is used to keep them safe and out of harm when you are unable to be with them for long periods of time (more than 2 hours is long for a dog).  Properly used a crate will provide a place of comfort for your dog to go whenever they want to. My dogs go into their crates all the time when I am home and take naps. Your dog is not too old to be crate trained either. It will take more effort and time, but your dog will adapt to almost any situation. Since he obliviously chews on things when you are not home, you should crate train him to protect him from getting into something that may injure or kill him. It will also stop him from eating your personal belongings. You must make the training a positive experience for your dog to get teh best benefit form the crate.<br>  www.dogbehavioronline.com|`|KxjUim7yaa	Crate training is to train your dog to potty at the right time in the right place. It also prevent the dog from chewing your shoes or the couch. My dogs are older and do not need a crate they are trained. They have their own area.|`|AA10912383	Dogs are den animals, and they won't make a mess in their crate unless they're not able to physically "hold it" any longer.<br>  I have a 4 month old German Shepherd, and I've been crate training her and it's worked well so far.<br>  You want to get a crate that will be big enough for your dog to be able to turn around comfortably and be able to stand up without hitting his head on the top of the crate (but you don't want it so big that he'll be able to go potty on one side and sleep on the other). Also, having a crate will help when you're not able to watch him/her all the time, and if you want to make sure that he/she doesn't have any accidents on the rug or anything. While crate training my puppy, she has not had one accident in her crate.|`|HNSHwnJ8aa	crate training is good if its hard to keep an eye on your dog and it goes in secret spots.  i think the general idea is that, since dogs dont like soiling their own space, they'll hold it until you let them out.  obviously, if you crate them for 6 hours they'll soil the crate but if you crate them after meals and other times you expect them to go, and take them outside immediately, they'll learn to hold it and that the only appropriate place to pee is outside|`|jazR1sk1aa	People please don't answer questions if you don't know the answer. <br>  <br>  The theory behind crate training (which does work), is that you get a crate that isn't much larger than the dog itself.  That way the dog doesn't go to the bathroom in it.   They won't usually go in a space that they sleep in.  <br>  <br>  Yes, sometimes accidents happen, that's why they are build with a bottom that can slide out and is relatively easy to clean as long as you have access to a hose.  <br>  <br>  It, like said above, also trains them to hold it and when to go to the bathroom - i.e. - when you let them out.  Also it dampens anxiety so the cannot chew on furniture or left out items.<br>  <br>  A great method of training when you're not able to be with the dog 24/7|`|0J0A7HqCaa	First off, what in the he** are you talking about with the um anyway um plaid dog house?<br>  <br>  Ok crate training a dog 2 yrs old will be a challenge.  Most puppies are crate trained before 12 weeks.  The reason for crate training (puppy) is so that the puppy can't run free around the house and tear your sh*t to pieces at night or when u are not there.  Also the main reason is potty training ur puppy.  If your dog is over the whole puppy stage with the chewing then he doesn't need a crate. If your dog is house trained the he doesn't need a crate.  If he is left out to roam the house at night and when ur not there, he doesn't need a crate.  A simple dog bed will do.  A dog at 2 is used to what it's been doing.  He will not like the crate.|`|AiAHnPyDaa	Yes crate training is very easy. Purchase a crate but do not let it be too big. Get the dog use to the idea. The sooner the better. Give the dog a treat and praise the dog when it goes in a crate. DO NOT USE THE CRATE AS PUNISHMENT. When the dog is facing you and in the crate then close the door when the dog is facing you.|`|9ZLl7nZcaa	Its the only way to train a dog to go outside. A young puppy may have a problem holding it for over 4-5 hours ,but an older dog can hold for a very long time the majority of the time.I have trained 6-8 dogs that way myself and have known a lot of people to say the same thing.ITS THE ONLY WAY TO POTTY TRAIN A DOG|`|A9NBtUy6aa	Well he seems to be getting a little old- better when they are tiny pups.<br>  <br>  However, it really worked for us. My puppy was trained to use it and it meant now she only urinates outside, and perfectly behaved. It also meant that when she was really young, we didnt have to worry about her running round the house and getting hurt.
SnAsZapMaa	No. There is no such thing as a "Shepard".<br>  <br>  But if you meant "Shepherd", then....<br>  Of course!<br>  <br>  But for sheep on hill country you'd be better off with a NZ Heading Dog (aka the Eye Dog) in front and a NZ Huntaway behind. (Huntaways are NOT suitable for townies - they operate by barking the whole time they are working. That way the shepherd can tell which ravine or copse the dog is checking out, even though the dog is totally out of sight.)<br>  <br>  However, a BC and an AS are much more similar in style than are a BC and a GSD, and my group is often highly amused by the tales of Seal (an old BC) training Bria (a young GSD) for aspects such as "balancing the bubble". And naturally it is the GSD that is more responsive to the owner's wishes and safer with the bird-life. If you want to be amused (and risk being converted to the discovery that GSDs are the naturally superior breed.....), search my group's messages for the word BRIA, and then read the messages written by Linda.<br>  <br>  None of the breeds you or I mention were developed to herd cattle.

Usually, there is one dog working the stock at a time unless the herd is huge. Plus, people will put an older, more experienced dog with a younger one during the learning process, but usually it's one dog at a time. <br>  <br>  Aussies herd more up right and are more nippy. Border Collies are low and stalky and use a lot of eye.|`|df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	Any two dogs can be taught to work together if you have enough control over them. Aussies tend to run tight and are pushy, border collies tend to run wide and can be either pushy or not depending on their nature. This actually might be a nice combination for a large herd where the BC makes sure no sheep run off and gathers them neatly and the aussie pushes the slow ones.|`|3zv2bbolaa	You can use the two breeds, but as mentioned they tend to have very different working styles. An Aussie tends to be nice in a pen, for close up work and on cattle and rough sheep. BC's work well at a distance with big huge outruns, but aren't that keen on moving cattle and often are reluctant to get into a tangle with a stubborn steer.|`|98p5v51zaa	Border Collies and Australian Shepard are both excellent herding animals. However, border collies tend to be very aggressive toward other dogs. If they are raised together from pups they would probably be O.K., but I would not recommend these two breeds to work together very well.|`|vIYGV1C7aa	I really don't know, but I can't see why not as long as you can give them strong enough leadership to do so.  In my experience and personal observations, once they begin their work, dogs usually don't care what other breeds are working with them.

The scientific community regards the Loch Ness Monster as a modern-day myth, and explains sightings as a mix of hoaxes and wishful thinking. Despite this, it remains one of the most famous examples of cryptozoology. The legendary monster has been affectionately referred to by the diminutive Nessie[3] (Scottish Gaelic: Niseag)[1] since the 1950s.|`|cnPKAlDYaa	Could well be Ogopogo..thought to be more snake-like than Nessie<br>  <br>  While Ogopogo has never attained the fame of Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster, the creature of lake Okanagan has regularly caused quite a stir in the international press. Monster hunters from all over the world have been drawn to the area for research purposes, and many of the sightings have been as strong or stronger than those at Loch Ness. Multiple witness sightings of Ogopogo, so rare with many other controversial phenomena, have occurred on many occasions. <br>  <br>  On September 16, 1926, Ogopogo was watched by some 30 cars of people along an Okanagan Mission beach. Not many monsters have been seen at one time by so many people. The Ogopogo sightings of 1925/26 deserve some in-depth study. <br>  <br>  Consider the appearance of Ogopogo on July 2, 1947, when a number of boaters saw the monster simultaneously. One of the witnesses, a Mr. Kray, described the animal as having "a long sinuous body, 30 feet in length, consisting of about five undulations, apparently separated from each other by about a two-foot space, in which that part of the undulations would have been underwater...There appeared to be a forked tail, of which only one-half came above the water. From time to time the whole thing submerged and came up again." <br>  <br>  On July 17, 1959, Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Miller and Mr. and Mrs. Pat Marten saw a tremendous creature with a snake-like head and a blunt nose swimming some 250 feet behind their motor boat on British Columbia's Okanagan Lake. The group watched the unknown animal for over three minutes, after which it submerged.|`|XL1qZboKaa	U weren't very descriptive but i think ur talking bout what he said|`|8j7h1ayiaa	maybe garder snake they often live near lakes.|`|bmKY5OMSaa	anaconda|`|A5JCdps7aa	hmm....<br>  maybe you are talking about The Lochness Monster (aka Nessie...). <br>  hmm<br>  or are you talking about something more reliastic?<br>  like an anaconda.|`|KyGhcrzLaa	do you mean the loch ness monster or larry the snake who lives in lake erie

enC9TvxUaa	-Tough question.  Yes, 100 would be way too many, but how many could you take care of???  They also NEED attention, not just food and vet care.  A rehabber would have more, but would have them long enough to get them back to health, then off to their furr-ever home.  Too many for keeping- I would say 5 would be the limit really.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Depends on how much you can afford. To me, 15 is too many. If people have so many dogs, how can they be sure that they are healthy if they don't have that much time to dedicate to each and every dog? If a dog winds up with an abscess, for example, it may be a while for that person to even notice.|`|p7swtBYzaa	What a kind, lovely goal you have, I commend you for caring about homeless dogs.<br>  <br>  The limitation is not just money, but also the time involved.<br>  To have more than a small number of dogs, you will need other people to socialize the dogs, play with them, walk them, help care for them.<br>  <br>  The more logical option for most people is to foster dogs for an established rescue.   I do that and have helped save dozens by taking them in, working with any issues they have, health and behavior, showing them how to live with a family - and then finding them good Forever Homes.   In the process I have adopted a few that were too old or damaged to be easily adopted by others, so I have 5 of my own.<br>  You can do this too, anyone with some time and patience can.   When you have the resources, volunteer with a rescue to help foster, do transportation, whatever is needed.   We can all make a difference, even if it is not on a grand scale.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I think 5 is a manageable number. I live in the country. I raise beef and vegetables. We have fruit trees. Vet bills can be high or low. We paid $2,000 for a broken leg on our puppy when he got it caught in a lounge chair.How big will they be? Remember if you are feeding Raw, the proportion of meat to bone and organ meats.You might have to buy some of that. Don't forget to feed yourself too. (we had 5)|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	i dont recommend more than 5 or 6. it takes more than money to care for animals, they need love, companionship, training, etc.|`|UBwWBiLTaa	i think 10 is to many|`|9AzUeF9saa	I think that it would depend on how much time you plan on spending with your dogs.  Just because you can afford to have as many as you want does not mean you should have that many.  I think that at the most 6-7 because if you had more they would most likely not get enough attention.    You need to be able to spend enough time with your dogs to be able to notice a difference in temper/personality, eating habits etc.  If you had more than 7 dogs you wouldn't get to know each dog really well, which is basically the reason people love to have dogs for pets.  If you cannot spend time with every dog, (almost) every day then you should not get a lot of dogs.  Based in the info I think you should have about 5 dogs, which would let you have a strong bond with each dog, while having enough dogs to satisfy your want.<br>  <br>  Also I would recommend getting dogs from a shelter because you can afford to train them or hire a trainer if necessary.  There are too many dogs in shelters! People need to stop breeding dogs!<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped!  :}|`|yTfO0fGmaa	I would have to agree with more than 5 or 6 is too many. <br>  <br>  Its not just the vet bills that you have to take into account.<br>  1. How many are you going to get at one time?<br>  2. Are they going to be puppy's?<br>  3. Will they be rescue and can you meet any special needs they may have?<br>  4. Will they get on if they are all different ages, breeds and backgrounds,<br>  5. What will happen to them when you are working?<br>  6. Will you have enough time in your life to give them the exercise/stimulation and affection they need?<br>  <br>  I could go on but there is alot to consider when wanting more than one dod, I know so many people who find it hard with just one dog let alone more than one. <br>  I've always found at least 2 is a good idea, they can keep each other company if you ever go away and they can share experiences together especially if they are litter mates.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|XL1qZboKaa	7 dogs are too much. the right number If REALLY love dogs is 5. but if u just like dogs, 2|`|vIYGV1C7aa	It really depends on the you as an individual.  I know someone who has a dozen dogs, but he also lives on a 32 acre ranch and each of those dogs has a "job" to do.  He gives each and every dog personal attention and works with them constantly.  With his attention towards them and giving them a purpose, this number is acceptable for him.<br>  <br>  Now if you just want to have dogs for pets and will not be able to give them the personal attention (affection, training and leadership) that they NEED, then you may want to look at just having 2-3 of them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
M9o5WpOqaa	Hi there.What your baby went thru is better left in the past...All you need to focus on right now is giving her the loving home that she needs/deserves.<br>  I adopted a 6+ month old Russian Dwarf from my local pet shop that someone had abandoned on the front steps of the store.The pet shop owner tried to put her in the cage w/the other Russians but she was much too aggressive and bit ALOT,so she was put in a separate cage.I went into the pet shop one day (to buy some guinea pig food) and saw her sitting there by herself in this little cage-she looked sad and frightened.I asked the owner about her,who told me the story,then I walked out.About a minute later,I got out of my car and went back into the store and adopted her on the spot-that was in Sept.2007 and we named her Sophie.(This was our first hamster,now we're on our 4th.) Anyway,she was obnoxiously aggressive,hissed and repeatedly drew blood when she bit.But everyday,my daughter and I subjected ourselves to the painful bites and she eventually calmed down...In January of 2008 we were able to pick her up/cuddle/play with her without the fear of getting bit.It was a LONG process,but she needed to learn to trust us back.We think that she came from a home with small children who didn't know any better,and parents that didn't supervise them.Sophie lived a very happy,loving life with us until Sept.2008.RIP Miss Sophie (who ironically was a male,we later found out).<br>  All I can say is that YOU are her family and she has long since forgotten her painful past.Make her future the best ever!|`|KeevlZnTaa	Most likely the adoption service is not going to know much more than they already told you. Obviously the owner is not going to say, "I abused this animal and that why it bites". If they were abusing it, they probably didn't tell the adoption service, so all they(adoption service) would know is what the previous owner told them.<br>  <br>  Most likely the hamster was not abused. I have seen many people that buy an animal and then don't want it anymore. The hamster probably bit them once and they used that as an excuse to get rid of it. Some people feel the need to justify why they are getting rid of a pet, and "it bites", sounds much better than "I got him for my kids, didn't realize that it would... smell if not cleaned regularly/make noise at night/not be as friendly as cuddly as I wanted/etc. You'll never know why the animal was really given up, but most likely they probably just got tired of her, or they bough her for the kids, and they grew bored.<br>  <br>  You did a good thing adopting her. So many animal are "thrown away" when people get tired of the responsibility. I will never understand why people get a pet they know is going to be with them for 2-3 years, and then get tired of them after 2-3 months. There are so many ways to get info on a pet these days(for most people you don't even need to leave your house), but people still buy animals without knowing what they are getting into, and then the animal suffers for it.|`|dhBcx0lwaa	on my opinion i think they were lying about it as an excuse to letting <br>  the hamster go.|`|1hAmHBfdaa	She probably wasn't properly taken care of. If they said she was to much for them to handle, her cage probably didn't get cleaned often. And she was young, so she would have needed a lot of attention, which she didn't get. <br>  Now she will probably be OK and will be happy. Just make sure to keep the cage neat, hamsters like that. (: Have fun with your new pet.|`|R68afrPeaa	I don't think that you should worry. There previous owners just might have been looking for an excuse to get rid of her. Maybe they had small children, who didn't know how to handle a hamster, so it bit them, or maybe the hamter's cage didn't have a wheel, and it was bored, so it decided to bite. <br>  <br>  As long as your giving her a great home, thats all that matters!
lZiBRhGyaa	iight, ive never gave my hamster a chinchilla sand bath thing, hamsters don't need baths. and sinse it is chinchilla sand specifically for chinchillas it probably isnt safe for a hamster. it could get in her eyes or she could inhale it, its just not a good idea.<br>  <br>  hamsters are better on their own. they are solitary animals, it depends what kind of hamster you have though. most hamsters are good on there own. they WILL fight over territory and might kill eachother too. i would not reccomend it at alll! i did this same thing and they faught for a long time then i separted them. please dont .. also the cage will stink worse if they do end up getting along<br>  <br>  and sense you didnt get them together they might fight. so just leave it by its self. also it would be territorial|`|WUhE9Vi0aa	the sands are both fine for ethier. don't worry you can trust me my dad's a vet. they can be one or two happily but dont get three unless you have a big care and a lot time for them. all that depends on their personality.
QrjjiOgTaa	are you like 10? they will go into "heat" and will bleed a little, and they wear diapers, inserting objects into an animals vagina would be a form of abuse, so grow up|`|PM23RDycaa	No and No.<br>  <br>  The estrus cycle is not that same as the human period.

Suz, maybe if you don't know, you shouldn't answer :) <br>  <br>  <br>  Anyhow, they don't make "tampons" that I'm aware of, but they certainly make "female dog pads", that are basically a diaper for them during that time.<br>  <br>  You should be able to get them at most petstores that carry dog stuff, or they can usually order them for you.<br>  <br>  I only found that out after working my petstore for awhile.  Had no clue.|`|QXJ2jnpXaa	yes, they do get their period. No they don't make tampons for dogs. If you are worried about it they do make diapers for dogs, but really a dog will generally keep herself clean.|`|Kp5BOhNVaa	Females go into heat about 2 times a year and it can last a couple weeks. They have doggie diapers. But I suggest you just fix your dog, its healthier.|`|nd30LQhlaa	no but some peole get doggie dippers or underwear...or some people use little kid underwear and put pads in them.|`|EKCSst62aa	yes dogs get periods. i just put baby diapers on my dog before we got her spayed.|`|9Rg73dWGaa	no they dont make tampons for dog, but they make diapers
teDI6RQ8aa	She's fine.  Just supervise kids with her and never leave them alone together.  The same goes for when you have kids.<br>  <br>  Edit: All dogs jump at times, mostly on or off of furniture.  What you might ought to do is not spend quite as much time with your dogs, so that way they won't get jealous if you do have a baby.  Once the baby comes, you'll be so burdened down you won't have time for the dogs like you did.  Ask any mother this.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	She should be fine. I wouldn't have any problem letting my feist play with kids & he is about the exact size of your dog.  My westie loved to play with kids & he was only 18lb but a nice sturdy dog also.  As long as  everyone involved knows the rules about what is allowed & not allowed, I wouldn't worry .|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	she needs to get used to children and she will just keep supervising her until you feel confident she is ready|`|AoSeHXeQaa	She looks pretty sturdy to me :o)<br>  Just dont leave her alone with the kids - always supervise.<br>  <br>  They should not be allowed to pull hair, or ears, or poke eyes.  Most older children will know that.<br>  <br>  You can also demonstrate the correct way to play with her - throwing the ball, etc.  Just tell them the poodle does not like to be touched, and that she is off limits.<br>  <br>  This is a good opportunity for you to teach the kids how to relate to your dog, as well as teaching the dog how to relate to kids.|`|uTIgyCCHaa	She doesn't appear to be fragile from your pictures.  If you have instructed them on how to play with her (and how NOT to play with her) and they don't listen, they shouldn't be allowed to play with her anymore, especially if they are being so rough with her that she might get hurt.  If she becomes fearful or defensive from the way the children play it isn't even worth her being around them at all, especially since you want her to be good with your kids in the future.|`|nd30LQhlaa	I understand you dont want her to get hurt =] but shes plenty sturdy enough just supervise all the playtime that way youll feel safe about it all too =]|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	What a cute little girl. ^-^ <br>  <br>  You'll probably want to set a good example for the children, first and foremost. Show them an appropriate way of playing with your dogs. If your poodle doesn't like to be handled, fear not! Just tell the kids he doesn't like to play as much as your other dog. Kids are all about playing, and they'll only play with your female once they learn that the poodle will just run from them (or whatever he does when he doesn't feel like being handled). <br>  <br>  Jack Russells are a very sturdy breed, so I really wouldn't worry about her getting hurt. ;] So long as mommy is supervising.|`|Wcr2nhxMaa	uhh just dont let her jump and everything should be okay
tT256JQRaa	it could be mites - if it is she might also be itchy and have more bald patches soon on her sides, tail, and lower back - and you should take her to the vets for a cure.<br>  it wont be ticks - tick grow quite large and tend not to cause hairloss - you would definately know if it was ticks - they'd look like big, shiny brown, round things on your hamster.<br>  <br>  however, if the hamster is old, it could just be age related hairloss and therefore nothing to worry about :)|`|DJL04ijJaa	nothings wrong with it. it is just the spot where it moves its legs so there tends not to be alot of fur there|`|tGmwqtr5aa	I think she might have lice or ticks. Sometimes rodents loose their hair whenever they have either of those bugs. Go to a vet, they'll know what to do. <br>  <br>  ~Ethie|`|blkv1GHaaa	She looks okay it might just be from rubbing agaisnt something in tis cage.  Dont worry!|`|dhBcx0lwaa	take him to the vet. i never met a hamster like that b4

Small size comes with BIG health problems.<br>  <br>  No such thing as a "malti-poo" either - that's ANOTHER term made up by irresponsible breeders trying to sell their MUTT dogs for more money. Again, they will likely come with BIG health problems. <br>  <br>  Do not support either type of breeder - adopt if you want a runt or a mutt.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think that you're in love with is the puppy-look.

Because every Maltese puppy I've ever seen that has grown to an adult look exactly the same except slightly larger and maybe even cuter than their puppy days. You may want to go back and double check your sources.  Another breed to consider are toy Poodles....My mom had the cutest little white one and he only weighed about 7 pounds fully grown.

AA10247494	Here's the easiest way to explain it...<br>  <br>  Your reins and crop are some of the many tools we use to tell our horses what we want. The reins lead the head and the crop, boot, spurs, or other method direct the horse's hind end. It's important to use these signals right to convey the right meaning to your horse so that he understands what you want and learns to work with you.<br>  <br>  For example say you are using your crop on the left side and you pull your left hand (and rein) back to tap him what you are saying to the horse is, "I want to move your hind end to the right and turn your head to the left." That is how he'll understand it so he'll go, "Okay she wants me to turn around." and he'll probably start spinning or at least turning in a circle. <br>  <br>  If your have both reins in one hand and aren't pulling either way and are tapping him on the behind you are saying, "I want your head to go straight and your behind to move." so he'll go interpret that as you wanting him go forward.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Try holding the reins in both hands while you reach beside you to tap the crop on the horse behind your leg....AND keep from pulling on the bit on one side.|`|EVvYS2jwaa	If you didn't put the reins in one hand, you wouldn't be able to reach behind your leg without completely relinquishing the reins and losing control of the horse or pulling on his mouth if you don't loosen them. You need to hit behind the leg because horses move away from pressure. Putting this "pressure" on them from behind their drive line will cause them to move away from it, which is forwards.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	If you are using a crop and want to apply it behind the leg then putting the reins in one hand stops you from compromising your position ( causing you to jab the horse in the mouth or drag to one side etc) when you swing the crop. Bluntly put but true.<br>  This is why a schooling or dresssage whip is better than a crop - you can use it behind the leg with a slight flick of the wrist and without having to swing and without taking the risk of it messing up your position and balance.|`|RloOJ43haa	Well, if you leave the rein in the hand that you are using for the crop, you will yank him in the mouth when you tap him. That says "whoa" and "go" and the same time, and not nicely. You want to make your aids clear to the horse, not conflicting. And you use the crop behind your leg since it is a reinforcement to your leg.|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	It can be hard to bring one hand back well holding the reins and not pull on your horse's mouth.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Well think about it. If you are holding the reins with both hands, and try to pull your hand all the way back to reach his hind with the crop, won't you be pulling REALLY hard on that one rein? And causing him to stop or turn horribly sharp?<br>  <br>  Holding the reins in one hand to hit the back allows you to remain in control, and keep you and your horse in balance.|`|RUxRNsf4aa	Well for one if your crop is a standard length crop then it really isn't physically possible to use the crop and hold the reins with out jerking the horses mouth. You dont want to accidentally whip and yank the mouth at the same time, that would result in mixed signals...|`|nrpIPxe1aa	Basically so you don't pull his mouth. plus i tried one day not and it made it difficult to get the crop in the right place. Also if you pull his mouth you could end up getting him to turn and depending on the situation ure in and the amount of people there could potentially be dangerous.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	you put the reins in one hand when you go to spank the horse so that you don't pull on his mouth. if you were to keep both hands on the reins while smacking him, you'd be giving him conflicting signals.

Also so you have more of the crop and more room to smack!|`|xSOAwIXsaa	Because if you hold both reins then you will be pulling him back and telling him to go at the same time

eidGiG3Kaa	3 years old is a little young for a dog to start developing dental diseases but it's still very possible. I would try giving the vet a call and ask them what they think you should do. This is a hard question to answer though without seeking the dogs teeth. What did the tooth that fell out look like? Did it look rotten or decayed? Does your dogs mouth have a strong odor? If so, I would recommend bringing the dog to the vet. They will probably clean the teeth which can be expensive sense it involves anesthesia and  put the dog on antibiotics if there is an infection.  <br>  It is possible that the tooth just got knocked out from playing with her sister especially sense she has an under bite. Keep in mind that you should be brushing your dogs teeth to keep them healthy and less prone to tooth decay and disease’s. <br>  <br>  Hope it all works out ok!|`|2ORqOh51aa	Do you Love your dog ????<br>  <br>  <br>  Of course you should. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you woke up in the morning and had a pillow full of teeth or a growth the size of an orange on your forhead I would hope you would get medical attention.|`|364Zj7yBaa	If I was u YES i would go to the VET.

hQQuqyYcaa	Sounds like you need a better vet. With a physical exam, the vet should listen to the heart, lungs, intestines, look at mucous membranes, eyes, ears, teeth, skin...just all over, really. Also, if you didn't hear from him, his veterinary technician, or receptionist about when to come back, maybe they're not too thrilled in having your business? No offense to you. Telling a client when to come back for the next round of puppy shots is a sure-fire way to get the client back in your hospital. Definately bring the puppy's records to another vet.|`|AA10029366	Typically they will take the puppy's temp, listen to the heart and lungs, look into the ears/eyes, and examine structure for anything unusual (i.e. loose stifles).<br>  <br>  Sounds like your vet was lazy...hope he didn't charge you for an exam!<br>  <br>  Vets usually give vaccines every 4 weeks: 8, 12, and 16 weeks is the norm.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	a proper exam includes weight, temp, pulse, respiration, listening to the pups heart and lungs, feeling the abdomen and checking the mouth, eyes, and ears.<br>  <br>  vaccines are given every 3 weeks until 16 weeks of age.|`|KxjUim7yaa	My vet would have done a complete exam, answered any question and made suggestions about feeding and when to come back. Glad the legs are fine. Feed a good quality food. Call the vet for time to bring him in for his next shot, and maybe get a better vet.|`|5I01tsgYaa	A general wellness exam normally includes getting the weight; checking the eyes, ears, and teeth; listening to the heart; and touching the puppy all over to check body condition.|`|IzezjhUBaa	its usually 10 weeks(may be different in america think it is every 4 weeks till 16 weeks of age... but not 100%) so he is due he should have checked, ears, eyes, legs, spine, heartbeat, lungs, bladder, bits(man or women :P, ermm.... that it i think... teeth abdomen, nails, worming , flea control|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Find a new vet.  Before you do, go down to their office, tell them you're moving and need a copy of your pups records to take with you.  Once you have those in hand, tell them the real reason you're leaving.  That you feel you got shorted with the "puppy exam" and want to find vet that is as serious about your dogs health as you are.  <br>  <br>  He should be vaccinated every 3-4 weeks.  So, you got a week to find a new vet.<br>  <br>  Next time I see my vet, I'm going to hug her.  She always checks my boy out completely and answers all my silly questions with the patience of a saint.|`|bIaywrBCaa	an all over exam including checking heart and lungs, mouth and teeth, quick eye and ear exam.

e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Okay, when you look at a normal bridle's browband (and possibly noseband) you will see that the side touching the horse is flat and the other side is somewhat rounded.  In a square raised bridle, the non-horse side is not round, but square, meaning the browband sort of pokes out with semi-vertical sides and a flat surface, instead of an arc of a circle like you normally see.|`|39Kjqp4Faa	A square raised bridle is a bridle that has a "raised" brow band and noseband. The "raise" is in a square shape and it's merely for decoration. It has nothing to do with the bridle's fit. There are different varieties of stitching and raise on different brands of bridles.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	a square raised bridle actually refers to the shape on the nose band, not the length of the cheek pieces.<br>  pic:<br>  <a href="http://www.barnsby.com/assets/images/products/3145B.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.barnsby.com/assets/images/pro...</a>|`|7lsU5bcoaa	Square raised means that the part on the noseband and browband where it gets thicker (between the stitching) has sqaure edges.<br>  <br>  hard to see, but look at how the noseband and browband is on this bridle: <a href="http://www.tackroominc.com/images/231102sm.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tackroominc.com/images/231102...</a>  (this is square raised) <br>  <br>  this is plain raised, as you can see the noseband and browband are different : <a href="http://www.horsetackco.com/images/colplaraised.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsetackco.com/images/colpla...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Its a subtle difference but often people choose square raised bridles for horses who don't have any white markings since it adds dimension to their face. of course it looks OK on any horse and the difference isn't noticeable.|`|RloOJ43haa	I think that refers to the detail of the noseband and brow band.
CtK04QcVaa	Those are bite wounds. Your two geckos have been fighting. Male leopard geckos and most other male reptiles can't be put in the same cage or they will fight. You'll want to separate them.  After you separate them you'll want to let them heal.|`|wLgGD63raa	You need to separate them. If you don't, they will continue to fight, even to the death.<br>  <br>  It does not matter if they've lived together their whole lives. They are going to fight at some point, which you have obviously just learned the hard way. =( Get them separated and everything should be fine. <br>  <br>  To help the cuts heal, you can put some triple antibiotic on them, but make sure the antibiotic does NOT have a pain reliever in it. You also need to put the injured gecko on paper towel substrate in his own cage until he is healed.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	Male leopard geckos should be separated once they reach sexual maturity or they will fight. you need to separate them|`|8j7h1ayiaa	you should never put to male in the same cage even if they have been together there whole life once they are older which they are know they will fight. those cuts will heal after he sheds a couple of times but the best thing to do is to separate them.|`|TkJn9gO0aa	There is no excuse for this.<br>  <br>  The #1 rule concerning leopard geckos is "1 male per enclosure". <br>  <br>  I'm sorry if you think I'm rude, but did you do ANY research at all? Every caresheet(even the crappy ones) have enough sense to advise against putting 2 males together. <br>  <br>  The wounds don't look too bad, but I wouldn't be surprised if the very tip falls off. Clean the wounds with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. To further cease the risk of infection, keep the gecko on paper towels or newspaper and change them daily until the wound(s) is healed up....1-2 quick sheds.|`|bmKY5OMSaa	Well it sounds like they are mature enough that one is showing agressive behavior because it showing his the man of the tank and he will stop the other one from eating and it seame he is hurting him because the other won't bow down to him the little one needs to be taken out to another tank you can put bag bam or reptile band aide they sell at pet stores but what substance do you have in the tank if you have them on sand and none of our cages have rocks we have humid side and there house. we use non adshive shelf liner and the sand won't get in the food or the cuts I would take out the rocks because athey don't need rocks to shed you can spray them to help them shed and are you sure that they are males mating for geckos are very rough.
xmwQ6oRyaa	Things to do before your puppy arrives. <br>  <br>  Puppy proof your home.<br>  Secure electrical cords to the baseboards, or tape them up high, or string them through PVC pipe. Have plenty of bitter apple or tobasco sauce on hand for those that can't be put out of the way. <br>  <br>  Crawl around on the floor, seeing everything from your puppy's point of view. Look for pins, tacks, paper clips, and other assorted small items that your puppy could swallow. In particular, check under furniture. Then, look for anything that is dangling, like phone and appliance cords, tablecloths, etc. Remember to check at least as high as the pup can stand on his hind legs. <br>  <br>  Buy a few child safety gates and block off any rooms you do not want your puppy to have access to, or the room you want him to stay in. I have a gate across the library where my computer is, not to mention 2,000 books. I have an extra gate to lock them in the kitchen if I need to. The very best gate is the metal kind about three feet tall, but the short plastic ones work as well. The advantage of the short ones is that you can step over them instead of having to open and close. Of course, plastic can be chewed through, but I have never had a Mastiff chew or go over even the shortest gates. (My Chihuahua has chewed a hole in every gate, and can now go wherever she pleases). <br>  <br>  Be sure to remove any cleansers and soap powder containers from the floor, along with disinfectants, bleach and fabric softeners, toilet bowel cleaners and the like. Make sure that all insecticides are safely stored away. <br>  <br>  Toxic plants need to be put up high or discarded entirely. Artificial plants can be sprayed with bitter apple, but are a favorite of young pups to tear up. Swallowing pieces of silk or plastic can cause serious damage, so I usually put them up as well and introduce them slowly, one at a time. Also, remove any foil around the containers and any decorative rocks that may be in the pot. <br>  <br>  Find a high, secure place to keep any remote controls. Any item that contains batteries are extremely dangerous. If a pup chews up the remote control or a childs= toy and even so much as bites into the battery, it can cause severe burns, mercury poisoning and even death. (A pup I sold chewed a remote control battery and spent two weeks in the hospital being treated for mercury poisoning and burns. This cost the owners over a $1,000 in vet bills and they were lucky that he even survived). <br>  <br>  Put all shoes, boots, umbrellas, etc., in a closet and pick up any clothing laying around. Remember, nothing is sacred and if it is on the floor your pup will consider it his. A pup will just as soon chew on your underwear as a toy. <br>  <br>  Childrens' toys can also be dangerous, as small pieces can be broken off and swallowed, stuffed animals shredded, Barbie dolls beheaded. Also, children should be taught not to share their food, especially chocolate, with the new pup. <br>  <br>  First Purchases<br>  The most important purchase you will probably make is a crate. I recommend a wire crate. Buying a large crate (for the pup's eventual size) is more economical and can be partitioned off for housebreaking purposes. The partition can be moved as the pup grows. <br>  <br>  For bedding, you can get commercial crate pads to fit, or make them yourself. Blankets work well, but tend to slide around and the pup feels insecure about his footing. I usually use a canvas covered crate pad and put the blankets on top. They are easier to wash than the pad covers. Have several changes of bedding handy. Do not use new pieces of carpet unless they have been washed to remove the formaldehyde and other chemicals. However, carpet does work well under blankets to keep them for sliding. A heavy rubber mat or rug with rubber backing will work until the pup grows large enough to chew it up! <br>  <br>  Of course you will need food and water bowls. I like to use the 5 qt. stainless steel bowls. Plastic bowls can be chewed and dumped over easier and some will leach harmful toxins into the food over time. Many cases of "puppy pimples" can be traced to using plastic feed and water bowls. Stainless steel is easier to clean, sterilize and is dishwasher safe. As your puppy grows, it is a good idea to gradually raise the food dish. This helps with digestion and keeps them from having to Ahunch@ down on their front legs to eat. You can buy (expensive) raised dog diners, create your own or buy an inexpensive small "Grecian urn" from Kmart. The urns hold a 5qt bowl very nicely. <br>  <br>  Purchase a collar and leash before hand. An adjustable collar will work fine for the first few months. After six months, switch to a buckle collar for strength. The first leash should be a lightweight six foot lead for leash training. Later on, a nice leather or heavy nylon lead will be necessary. Get your pup used to a choke collar also, but never, ever leave the choke collar on any dog unless you are with them. They can easily become caught on something and strangle the puppy. <br>  <br>  Toys are alwa|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Cost of Food?<br>  Puppy can't be left alone for more then 2hours<br>  Adults max 8hours<br>  <a href="http://www.petstorecruelty.org/14%20Day%20guarantee.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petstorecruelty.org/14%20Day%...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.raot.org/information/10_reasons_to_adopt_an_older_dog.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.raot.org/information/10_reaso...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/dog_behavior_tip_sheets/puppy_chewing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...</a>|`|6qsocyK3aa	Worming tablets and de-fleaing spray.<br>  Maybe a flexi/extandable lead but I would see how she reacts to a normal one before you try that.<br>  Food obviously.<br>  Puppy milk is always a good idea.<br>  One thing I read which I think is a good idea is to rub a piece of cloth on the puppies mother for the puppy to sleep with when she comes home to comfort her.|`|AcxGPyG5aa	Just in case an wind up alarm clock and a hot water bottle.

I've trained for a long time and these videos have really improved my training technique and relationship with my horses.

Making him feel more enclosed may make him blow up ontop of you.<br>  <br>  I'd roundpen him first every day for a few minutes at a time.  Give him weeks of adjusting to you.  I'd not 'jump right in' and try to dominate as you will have a fight on your hands.<br>  <br>  Once you are to the point where the halter is on what you would do is give a tiny bit of pressure on the lead.  The second he gives to the pressure, let go.

Pass this one by and start with something less wild.  Trust me you can get hurt badly with a wild mustang.   If you "tie it to a tree" it will fight until he breaks the halter, the lead or his neck.  which ever gives first...<br>  If you try to put a butt rope around him you will find out how fast and hard he can kick....  stay away from this horse or you will get either yourself , someone else or the horse hurt.

This is based on their own natural way to respond to each other.  Might I suggest going to the Library and renting John Lyons videos on it.  <br>  <br>  Once you get through those steps in the round pen then you will find it easy to begin to teach the horse to lead the way Mandy suggested.  Trust me it is not hard this way just takes some work.<br>  <br>  We start alot of horses and this is very affective.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Jenny|`|AUJ6uG0oaa	There are a lot of steps before you get to leading, especially if he has never been handled.  For some of the people here, it is a little bit out of their league.  So I would be really careful who you take advice from on this topic.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kickingbearmustangs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.kickingbearmustangs.com</a>|`|BREi7qw7aa	if he has never been lead, have him drag around a lead when he's out to get him used to it for a few weeks. When you actually start leading him, make sure your always in front and dont let him be pushy.|`|5kUxkun3aa	wow you are going to have to spend loads of time getting him to join up with you. once you can handle him do the same as you would a young horse.<br>  <br>  don't tie him to something that is cruel.|`|AuzKTKemaa	My appaloosa filly was pretty wild when I first bought her, she did not like me leading her at all, in fact most of the time it was the other way round and she was the one doing the leading! I didn't want to tie her up or anything either, I am also more into natural training and used Eric Bravo's method. It was really easy to understand and you can watch his videos in case you are unsure of anything (see source below). Good luck with your Mustang!|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Don't tie him to a tree. Hah.<br>  <br>  Well, from my experience, you first have to get the horse used to you. If he won't even let you come near him, get him in a longe pin or round pin. Calmy walk into the pin and sit in the middle. He might run around on the outside, but he won't dare come near you (if he's this afraid). But remain sitting there until he calms down. Once he finally stops pacing and just stands calmly, or grazes, then get up and gently leave the ring. <br>  <br>  Repeat this the next day, and so on until he's ok and accepts it when you walk into the ring.<br>  <br>  One he's okay with it, then start taking a few steps in random directions in the ring. This way he can learn that when you walk or stand, it's not a threat.<br>  <br>  Also repeat this until he's calm about it.<br>  <br>  (Btw, during this process: While you're in the round pin, don't make any sudden movements or any "aggresive" moves that might make him uneasy or bolt.)<br>  <br>  Once he's okay with you walking around him, you can try to come in contact with him. Contact can just be a light touch of your fingertips to his neck, and that's it. Don't do too much too fast. And within each day, increase the contact.<br>  <br>  Work with him until you can touch him all down his neck, through his back, etc. Now introduce the halter to him. Hold it near is head, let him smell it, rubb it against his neck, back, etc.<br>  <br>  Once he's good with it, act as if you're going to put the halter on, but only slip it on half way. If he accepts it, then try to put it on. Once you succeed (this may take more than one try), attach the lead rope and gently pull as you try to walk with him. If he doesn't budge, feed him treats (hold them in front of him so that he has to take a few steps), this way you can show him that if he follows you, only good things will happen.<br>  <br>  And there you go =)<br>  <br>  Now this can take just a day or two... or it could take a week or two. It depends on the nature of the horse.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UyKMwdrAaa	Hi there one thing we have done is to dally the horse to the saddle of the horse we are riding and start leading.  If u have another horse they are more apt to lead along with u than to fight u.  If your horse has never done this sort of this it might not be safe for you.  We have roped off of our horses so they know what to do with the pull.  They have those be nice halters that stop from pulling back when u try to lead u could try that too.  Having him tied up to a post etc for a while will not hurt him at all just make sure he can not get his leg over the lead rope and if he pulls nothing is choking him.  Make sure there is nothing by this post or on it that can hurt him.  Horses need to learn to be tied and when he learns he can not pull back and get away that will be a good start.  When u go to lead him you can try pulling on the lead a little and then let up then pull again and just keep doing this.  When he steps a couple steps reward verbally.  "Good Boy".  Good Luck!
enC9TvxUaa	-And only does it onoce every 6 months?  Very odd.  Something must be bothering him.  Have you tried to see what is different during that period?  This is not normal for any breed I have ever heard of!|`|2dya7YeKaa	That is not "normal" in any dog, regardless of the breed.  This dog has a problem with aggression.  You need to get him a trainer.|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	This should by no means EVER be allowed. What your dog is doing is displaying aggressive (and dangerous!!) behavior toward you and your husband. Since you have failed to train him correctly, this behavior is only going to escalate until you have to put your beloved pup down, UNLESS you take steps to correct it. First: stop "spoiling" your dog. This hardly does anything for their manners. Second: I suggest hiring a behaviorist before your dog gets out of hand.<br>  <br>  In direct answer to your question: No. It is not normal in this breed. It is not normal in ANY breed, and should NEVER be permitted.|`|Rqb9gPN5aa	This isn't normal for any dog.  I can't believe that someone would let their dog draw blood, WOW!  I'd send the dog down the road if you don't want to take the time to do some training.  Your dog's breeder can refer you to your local kennel club who will refer you to a reputable trainer in your area.  <br>  <br>  WHY ARE YOU ALLOWING THIS HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR?  Just a matter of time before he bites someone and you are sued.<br>  <br>  Being spoiled is NO excuse.

pAcB7kz7aa	Ha- I have the same problem. And like you- I know everything a good owner should know about guinea pigs. Yes, you're right to not beg! <br>  But, a month ago, my dad was a "NO" on guinea pigs. Now he's 3/4s convinced. Now I can convince that other 1/4 by convincing my mom, so I'm going to try to help a sis' out.<br>  ^_^ Alright- I convinced my dad 1/4 by writing a 7-paged report on guinea pigs. But if you do this, try to leave out all the "And they'll die if ____ happens, and they'll die if _____ happens too, and they bite(well they don't but just for an example)" stuff, and although this might not work for your mom, if you haven't convinced your dad yet, this would PROBABLY work for 1/4.<br>  For your mom.. Hmm.. Well, I have asked MY mom SO MANY TIMES, that she'll just say plain, "No. You can NEVER have guinea pigs!" if I ask her again. So I have to take it slowly x_x and I think that's the state that you're in. So try keeping quiet about guinea pigs for 1 week and start acting SUPER NICE and do whatever she asks you to do, do all your homework before 6 PM or something,! That's what I'm doing and it's working :D she's like: O_o now.<br>  So yeah! I know it'll be like, complete torture for a while, but we gotta stand strong! =D<br>  Try also making a youtube video about guinea pigs. I did, and that convinced my dad another 1/4. ^_^<br>  And also- try going to several pet stores and write down the price of EVERYTHING you need for guinea pigs, and total it. And also- put the price of how much it costs per week, month, and year. That'd help!<br>  <br>  So this is a VERY LONG summary of what you should basically do:<br>  1. Stand strong<br>  2. Be extra nice<br>  3. Don't talk about guinea pigs for a week<br>  4. Do your homework before 6 (I do it before 1 PM since I'm homeschooled)<br>  5. Don't offer to do any chores- I know you think you should, but it'll seem like you're trying to "hint hint" them. All they really want is for you to do what you're supposed to do properly. Although I have no idea how to, I hope you will. ^_^<br>  6. If you get an allowance (unlike me), you should save up, because if your pet ever needs to go to the vet, and your parents won't pay for it, YOU have to! For the life of your guinea pig! ^_^ And your guinea pig will be like, "omg thank you for saving my life I LOVE YOU" Yes, I'm pretty sure you WILL get a guinea pig! =D<br>  7. Try hugging your mom whenever you see her doing chores, or kissing her. I do that too, and it takes away her 'tude a little! =D Though one time she screamed, "AHH! GET OFF ME!" but that was different lol<br>  8. Write a long report with everything you know about guinea pigs on it. It only takes a few hours, and if you're bored on the comp with nothing to do, this report will be something great!<br>  9: Go to pet stores with your parents (probably by begging them to go across the street when you're at some fast food place and the pet store's really nearby) and get your notebook, and write down everything you need for guinea pigs, and then put their prices next to them. Remember: Week, month, and year.<br>  10. Make a youtube video!<br>  11. Get dad in on this too, if he's not already! Cause now I have to convince mom, and she just hates guinea pigs, like yours. =(<br>  12. After a week has gone by, start planning how you'll set up the cage, what bedding you'll use, what type of material, etc... put it ALL on a diagram, make sure it's around 10.5 square feet big, make sure you have room in your... Well, room, and after your diagram is complete, tell your dad (since your mom is probably still p*ssed off) about what you're doing, and show him the diagram. Then show him the list of items with the prices, then show him your long report on guinea pigs, then tell him all that you've been doing, trying to get guinea pigs, and say that you've been researching guinea pigs for 3 months (even though you've been doing this for about 4, 4 months would sound like exaggerating :D) and you know everything a good owner should. Then ask him to ask you a few questions about guinea pigs, and how you would take care of them (study up, girl!) and then when you get them all right, politely ask your dad to ask/tell your mom about all your hard work, and if you can get guinea pigs!<br>  <br>  13: I really REALLY hope you won't do this: but if all else fails- talk to your friends when you're at school so your parents can't hear, OR your teacher. Then look around the rescue places with your friends, and find a (preferably two, though) guinea pig that is VERY VERY cute. I mean VERY cute. Then, ask your friends to keep the guinea pig for a few days with ALL the supplies that the guinea pig would need (EVERYTHING. This is why you need money! It costs $100+ to start with!), then, when it's Saturday or Sunday, or even a holiday or your BIRTHDAY'S coming near, ask your friends to knock on the door of your home, and put it on your front door. But before they knock on the door, cover the top half of the cage with a towel/blanket, and leave the bottom half open so the guinea p-|`|IFvj22PDaa	This is what i did to get a hamster: (My mom is hard to convince and this worked!)

Show responsibility<br>  4. be mature<br>  5. write essays and add up the total of all the supplies you need. It makes you look responsible ;)<br>  6. they dont cost much<br>  7. they dont smell unless u dont pick up their pee and poop<br>  8. they DONT carry diseases if you get them from a reliable pet store <br>  9. dont ever give up, it took me 5 months for a hamster..

W55tjTcbaa	large breeds are so much more fun!! i've had a chihuahua also but it's so much different from having a dog you can actually play with.  Any large dog breed.

I have a small apartment so I don't have much room for them to run in.

They look great and since they have hair (and not fur), they do not shed. Their hair grows and you'll need to give it haircut but it's better than having hair all over your couch. They are also cute and adorable. They are also very intelligent and learn stuff right away.|`|bIaywrBCaa	small. Chihuahuas in particular.

q2ekDMwtaa	My wife is answering this one:<br>  <br>  If you have guppies, chances are they're pregnant. If we have learned anything about live bearers, it's "If they were in a tank with a male at any point, they are most likely pregnant."<br>  <br>  I read somewhere a while ago that live bearers can store sperm for up to four months. So, you could buy a female that looks like she won't be adding a dramatic number of fry to your tank, and 2 months and 17 days later, you have several dozen little fry swimming around. Also, getting only females doesn't always work, either. Nature has a funny way of just deciding that it wants to change the sex of an animal from female to male. It's happened with both birds and fish, to my knowledge.<br>  <br>  At any rate, if you don't want all those fry, you could buy a bigger fish that will snack on them, but won't harrass your adult guppies.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy fishing :)|`|QV6swGUMaa	she will have what they call a gravid spot at the back of her and be fat.usually every 4 weeks depending on temp of water.<br>  <a href="http://www.aquariumhobbyist.com/guppies/gravid.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumhobbyist.com/guppies/...</a>|`|DU7iO8EHaa	there will be back spot on her. And she will look really big. It will take 3-4 weeks till the fry come.|`|HJkfIq8Waa	if they'll look fat and the gravid spot looks visible (black in color), near the anal fin..|`|SOxdyWQOaa	you will see a black shot|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Their gestation period is roughly 3 weeks, but if you intend to separate her from the others in a breeding net, box or a separate breeding tank I suggest doing it sooner rather than later.  It's best to put them in a few days before they intend to have the fry to allow the female to calm down and get used to their new environment.  It also separates her from the male and allows her to calm down.  Males will harasses the females, pregnant or not and this can be stressful.<br>  In my experience the female begins to look a little boxy a day or so before she's ready to drop the fry.  This is when I usually separate them.<br>  Best of Luck!
QrjjiOgTaa	they are an invertebrates.; but they are usally housed in the reptile section of the store and their supplies are house with reptile supplies, sometimes they need the same things so i understand how some people would ask hermit crab questions in the reptiles section.|`|KyGhcrzLaa	nope they are crustaceans, even though when you ask a question about them on yahoo answers they get put into the reptile category, geeez them stupid people|`|Tipi8BSkaa	no they are crustaceans....like crabs,lobsters, ect...|`|RA3p25Qoaa	no their inverts not reptiles.

UbSJPBuNaa	this is most likely two things its either because your tank is new and you getting something called bacteria bloom(normal) or you don't have enough filtering(gold fish need double the filtration because they produce a lot of waste)|`|bDPVRtCNaa	1.You put two goldfish in a ten gallon tank without cycling it first- that explains the cloudy water.<br>  <br>  ~Goldfish are massive waste producers and require larger tanks and heavy filtration so that their waste can be properly broken down/diluted. Otherwise it will build up and poison them. Even juvenile goldfish should be kept in at least twenty gallons.<br>  <br>  ~The tank did not cycle before you added fish. You are seeing a bacterial bloom.<br>  <br>  ~The goldfish may be small now, but should grow fairly quickly. Fancy goldfish grow 6-8 inches, and common goldfish should grow at least one foot long.<br>  <br>  Have your water tested at you local fish store or invest in a test kit. <br>  <br>  2. Tropical fish food is made for tropical fish. Goldfish food is specifically formulated for goldfish.<br>  <br>  ~I actually think the best course of action would be to return the goldfish, and buy an aquarium heater so that you can keep tropical fish. You already have the food.<br>  <br>  ~The guy at the fish store was misinformed. I'm not lying to you, I'm telling you what I have learned from years of experience, research, and work.<br>  Most pet stores have a guarantee of some kind. Petsmarts is 14 days, and Petcos is 15 days.|`|DU7iO8EHaa	Its called "new tank syndrome" . You didn't cycle the tank before you put the fish in.

There is no such thing as a "teacup" Maltese...surely you discovered that while you were educating yourself on the breed?<br>  <br>  Bottom line is, you live in your parents house, they make the rules, you have to obide by them.  If you are serious about taking on the responsibility of a new dog, then take it seriously and prove it to them.  Taking it seriously means actually doing some thorough research on the breed and acting like an adult, not whining on the internet because your parents won't cater to your demands and flaunting your lack of knowledge regarding the breed you are so eager to make a long term committment to.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	no one really neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeds a dog (helper dogs excluded) and there is no such thing as a teacup anything. teacup is a term used for inbreed, deforemed, unhealthy, runts. breeders (no reputable breeder would sell a teacup) give it a cute name and jack up the price. when you walk away paying 1200 for a mutated, unhealthy runt they probably say "SUCKER!" well who wouldnt? the maltese society does not recognize this dog, it is not a breed. it is called "teacup" because it is so unhealthy and deformed that it will never get to be the size of a normal maltese, and the vet bills for this type of odg will be a fortune. do everyone a favor and go to petfinder.com and type maltese after you researched and researched this breed and know for sure that this is what you want|`|AA10029366	The first thing you can research is that "Teacup" = Poor Quality Runt Bred By A Moron.<br>  <a href="http://www.cloverdaleyorkies.com/teacuprisk.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cloverdaleyorkies.com/teacupr...</a><br>  <a href="http://trenastoys1.homestead.com/tcup.html" rel="nofollow">http://trenastoys1.homestead.com/tcup.ht...</a><br>  <br>  For info on the breed, start here:<br>  <a href="http://www.americanmaltese.org/ama_general_tips.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanmaltese.org/ama_gener...</a>|`|PRnMm8wQaa	Sorry, there is no such thing as a "teacup" dog.  That is a term used by unethical/non-reputable breeders trying to sell their sickly pups for more $$.  Please educate yourself and get a healthy Maltese.  If you see a breeder advertising "teacup" dogs, please don't give them your business.  Try Maltese rescues too!!|`|gse1455saa	no help from here.  If mom and dad say no, it's no.  I groom a teacup (by the way it is not a recognized breed by AKC) maltese named Chloe for a woman whose daughter purchased her 3 years ago, she is now away in college and the dog has officially become mom's which is typically what happens in these cases.  Teacup maltese is nothing more then the smallest of the litter and breed.  That's all.  They weigh about 3 pounds and are riddled with health problems for the most part.  This pup will likely live to be about 15 or 16.  Are YOU prepared to carry this dog and care for it for the next 15 or 16 years?  You probably don't know, and will schrug your shoulders at that question when realistically the answer is no.   Just like Chloe.  There will be plenty of tiny malteses when you are in the position to care for her for her whold life.  Wait until then|`|pvgwJwxvaa	1) no such thing as a teacup anything.  no reputable breeder would ever breed teacups.<br>  <br>  2) if you want a dog, wait until you are 18, move out of the house, get a job and then you can have whatever kind of dog you want.<br>  <br>  3) you dont NEED a dog.  you WANT one.

3arJsZ91aa	Perhaps your cat would not be very happy being taken away from her home. Cats are not like dogs and unless they are used to being taken out for walks on a harness and meeting lots of new people, she might be very scared which wouldn't be very nice for her.  If you don't want to take your fish, but have to talk about your pet, you could take in some photographs of your cat to show the other guides and explain that your cat does not like new places and new people.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	your best bet is to leave her home in this case follow the rules|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	If they said they don't allow pets, how will you be the only one there without one?  Just leave the cat at home and follow the rules.
yYh76Gwkaa	Are there any fish in the tank?  Are you feeding them?  If yes it could be a piece of food that is decomposing.  I would suggest siphoning it out of the tank.<br>  <br>  Is the rock in the tank liverock?  If yes it could either be something dying on the rock or possible a sponge on the rock.  Again if it is something dying I would suggest siphoning it out of the tank, if it is a sponge it is fine.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your tank is newly set up so doing a water change at this time wouldn't hurt anything.  Just do a 10-20% water change and if you are using a biological filter leave that alone for the time being.

bHnkvuqgaa	I have had cavalier king charles spaniels they are a lovely little breed, lots of fun good with families and children, easy to train, as they love to please, they like lots of company, they do not like to be alone, so perhaps if you work long hours you should consider getting 2 so they are never lonely.  My dogs have never had the illness that has been mentioned, most dogs and humans have health issues, we wouldn't have children if we considered what they may or may not contract over the years.  Whatever you decide on I hope you enjoy your puppy.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Don't buy a designer dog. either get a poodle or a shitzue. When you get one of those mutts you are keeping BYBers and or puppy farms(mills) in business.<br>  A King Charles Caviler is a good choice, they always look so sad|`|2l7lbcJWaa	OK first of all, a "schnoodle" is a schnauzer/poodle. Shih-tzu/poodles are referred to as "shih-poos". Either way it's a mutt, so no one can really tell you what the personality is going to be like. It's fine if you want one, but whatever you do, DON'T pay a lot of money for one. The breeders put a cool name on it and make you forget that it's a MIXED BREED. People spend thousands on a dog that's not worth anything. If I were you I would definitely get a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. That will be the next dog that I get too. They're adorable and unlike what that other person said, they don't need alot of professional grooming, just brushing. And if you get a purebred versus the designer mutt, you will know what you're getting. I have only met one Cavalier and he was so sweet...kind of acted like a mini golden retriever. OH also, I was looking on petfinder.com and found so many purebred cavalier puppies. Just an idea. There may not be any in your area. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=13105294" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...</a><br>  These are some in my area.|`|A21SswSfaa	A "schnoodle" is a mutt, not a real dog breed. If you want one, that's fine. But make sure you get one from an animal shelter and don't expect any concrete information regarding mutts. <br>  <br>  Some family members of mine have a Cavalier. He is a very sweet, docile dog. But they do need to be groomed and they must be exercised daily!|`|hkfLD4Goaa	im not trying to put you off but the cavalier could get an awful thing called syringomyelia. this is basically through years of inbreeding and is were there brains over heat and become too big for their skull.

They are bichon frise and I read a book on bichons when they were pups which said never hit a bichon as they will remember it the rest of their life and it degrades them. Now to your problem- 1st take the puppy to the toilet 10 minutes after it eats or drinks-this way it knows when it gets that full tummy feeling it has to go out to the tiolet and eventually will learn to go to the door. My dogs knock on the door to go out. Their  breeders had towels in their beds as puppies so they thought carpet was a towel and therefore a toilet zone. So I put newspaper at all doors as they see a door and can't differentiate - so first restrict their access to rooms as they only learn a little at a time. A good idea is to put the newspaper at the door you go out of when you take the dog out to the toilet. Always reward the dog when it toilets outside as well as on the paper - a big celebration of well done, good dog. If the puppy still can't find the paper let previous wee dry on the paper and leave it as the undersheet as it will go again where it left its scent. This is also the reason it now goes everywhere as its scent is everywhere. If this doesn't work there is an oil, can't remember name from pet shop which attracts dogs and if you put a drop on the papare it will go there. eventually as it gets older you tak the paper away and it will go to the door where the paper was and know what to do. There is also a fake grass mat you can buy from pets shops and you can use it instaed of paper. Put it in its room where it sleeps at night for toileting (all over the floor) then use 1 sheet during the day at the designated door . It will learn to associate the night paper/mat with where is it in the day. remember your puppy is learning , he is not out to be bad and punishing him just gives confusing messages and then you will have an anxious neurotic dog wanting to please you but confused why he is hit. The smack normally occurs after the incident and they can't associate the 2 acts. You need to persevere and be patient for as long as it takes your puppy to learn, it won't happen immediately and if it does he can forget and needs help remembering again and again and again. Just love and patient understanding will raise the puppy you wnt to your best friend. Let me know how it goes|`|AA11621894	Never hit your dog. <br>  <br>  When we got our second dog she would often use the house as her bathroom.

I know its hard to lose your little buddy, but if he lived to be 5, you probably gave him a great life.  He most likely died quickly and painlessly, and that is the best way to go.
Nt7exGYAaa	It sounds as though she could possibly be pregnant and if she is you'll soon notice the swelling around the tummy area and at three weeks you should be able to feel the kittens. Just gently cup your hand around her tummy and you may even feel a kitten moving. This won't hurt the cat or the kittens.<br>  <br>  The nipples are one of the first signs to show she's pregnant as they become larger and pinker in readiness for feeding.<br>  <br>  At 5 weeks the skeletons can be seen on an X-ray. <br>  <br>  The gestation period is around 63 days.<br>  <br>  Her food consumption will of course be far greater now so keep up her food intake to about one and a half times what it used to be.<br>  <br>  It's a good idea to get a sturdy box ready for the birth and line it with a good amount of newspaper, by doing this soon, she'll get used to it BUT keep in mind that when she goes into labor she could also seek out a nice spot in your cupboard, under your bed or elsewhere. If you can get hold of her as she starts the labor stage, just gently place her in the box and encourage her.<br>  <br>  Usually the birth of the kittens is straight forward but if she appears to be straining, that's when you need to contact the vet.<br>  <br>  Have you made arrangements for the kittens?  It's a good idea to think about this now, ask around your friends and see if they'd like to adopt one.<br>  <br>  Your cat can also become pregnant again within days of giving birth so be aware of this.<br>  <br>  If you want her desexed, have a chat to your vet now and see what he suggests as to a time. It's not uncommon though for a vet to desex a cat only to find it's already pregnant, the only downside of that will be the bill at the end of the procedure as they charge more.<br>  <br>  Now all this is assuming that the cat is pregnant.<br>  <br>  If she shows any other signs of sickness or lethargy, vomits etc. then it's time to see the vet.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yeah she is congrads|`|cie3oBcXaa	I would say she is pregnant. My cat had all the same symptoms and gave birth to 3 lovely kittens within the month.|`|D51q8BlMaa	Take her to the vet just in case.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223132001AAVUKlE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|pvgwJwxvaa	spay her now!  do not wait for her to have kittens.  way too many homeless cats in the world.|`|K3jcdkveaa	yeah, she's prego.|`|JhAoOJ2yaa	yep, shes pregnant, i got my cat pregnant on purpose, before she was done, her pregnancy lasted 68 days, which is normal, every time i touched her belly, i got tons of scratches, but i also got to feel the kittens moving, if this is her first litter, she will most likely have 3 or 4. cat are some of the best mothers you will find, so its unlikely you will run into any problems, so good luck and have fun. they are so adorable.|`|tgzGcu5uaa	She is most likely pregnant, but make sure your vet knows in a few weeks, so he can make sure you have a big litter and healthy kittens!

Sounds like she is pregnant. She gave birth at 70 days to three beautiful healthy kittens - which we intend to keep.<br>  <br>  We were advised to get her altered to remove the the unborn kittens but we could not bring ourselves to do it. I am so glad we did not!!!<br>  <br>  Your right not to 'poke' but if you GENTLY, VERY GENTLY lay your flat palm on the side of her belly you can eventually feel them moving.<br>  <br>  By the way my kittens were born yesterday and are now about ooohhh... 34 hours old!<br>  <br>  It was a fantastic experience and she coped superbly, but we do intend to get her altered when the ittens are old enough to be removed from their mum.
SOxdyWQOaa	as many as they can eat in 3 to 5 minutes
EQydFhzmaa	I had three female guinea pigs that lived in the same cage, and two of them were long haired; only one long haired guinea pig is living. <br>  <br>  1. I wash mine once a month, but in the winter, it's usually 6 weeks to 8 weeks (two months) because I don't want her catch a cold. I also blow dry her fur with a hair dryer, and I trim her fur (mostly around her bottom) because it can get really "icky" if I don't. I also brush her three times a week - at least - but it is usually every day when I hold her. The brush I use is a cat brush that is really soft; the bristles are kind of like a toothbrush - they are really soft. This is the brush I use (except it's green): <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10449828" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  2. When you bathe them, you need to get special small animal shampoo. This shampoo: <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/11411/Pet-Scentsations-Premium-Small-Animal-Shampoos.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/11411/Pet-S...</a> is what I have been using for my guinea pigs forever. I really, really like it. So, the bathing process, I do not wash her face at all; I wash her body (so basically behind her ears - down). The water is at lukewarm temperature. I get her wet first (NOT her face), then I lather her with the soap, then I thoroughly rinse her, and then I dry her. I dry her all that I can with the towel, then I use the blow dryer, and then I trim her fur. It's actually pretty simple. <br>  <br>  3. The bedding that I use is PetsPick Pine Bedding. I get it in "jumbo" sizes, but the smaller packages look like this: <a href="http://www.awf.com/upload/product/12624_500P2PK-mnew.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.awf.com/upload/product/12624_...</a> The red cedar bedding can be linked to death, so do NOT use that. You could also use the gray, fluffy bedding, like this: <a href="http://www.awf.com/upload/103224_petspick500.jpg," rel="nofollow">http://www.awf.com/upload/103224_petspic...</a> but it is slightly expensive, it has a slight smell to it, and my guinea pigs just didn't like it. However, it may work for you so I would just give it a try. <br>  <br>  4. Your friend is wrong. My veterinarian holds my guinea pig on her back to trim her nails (we tried to do it at home, but it really wasn't worth all of the fuss). I have also known people who hold their guinea pigs like "babies" on their backs, and they are fine. It's like people who think they need to shove a shoehorn into a person's mouth who is having a seizure - your tongues are attached people!!! Do not touch a person who is having a seizure, just movie objects (like chairs) out of the way that can hurt them. Here is a cute video to show you that people do hold their guinea pigs on their backs: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1GKM0zuf7U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1GKM0zuf...</a><br>  <br>  5. Your guinea pigs should eat pellets, and only pellets. This is what I use: <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10323575" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a> You should NOT give them the guinea pig food with other ingredients like corn, sunflower seeds, and circular, colored pellet things. This kind of food killed one of my guinea pigs; it has too much protein. It gave my guinea pig a heart condition and we gave him medication everyday, but eventually, he just got too sick and his lungs filled up with fluids and we couldn't save him. Remember, it's just pellets. I also give one hand full of timothy hay per guinea pig per day. This is what I use: <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10818459" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a> For veggies, they eat just about anything. They LOVE carrots. For leafy veggies, make sure they are dark green only, like spinach - NOT iceberg lettuce. They also eat oranges (cut, and they don't eat the peals), apples, broccoli, strawberries, and watermelon (remove the seeds). When you change their water everyday, make sure you put a couple of drops of vitamin C in their water. Guinea pigs cannot produce vitamin C, so they need to eat it (like eating oranges or adding it to their water). This is what I use: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LM-Animal-Farms-Guinea-Vitamins/dp/B0002ASTVK" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/LM-Animal-Farms-Gu...</a> <br>  <br>  6. You should name your guinea pigs as their personality, or how they look. Five of my seven guinea pigs had names already, but two were named. Their names: Butterscotch, Smokey, Nutmeg*, Cinnamon*, Creme*, Carmel, and Little Moo. The choice is really up to you. The * indicates that these were females. <br>  <br>  7. You should leave your guinea pigs alone for AT LEAST the first 24 to 48 hours. They need to become acclimated with their surrounding, so they need time to adjust. They should be fine after that. Also, make sure your guinea pigs have a house for comfort and privacy. They need their own space, and I suggest a plastic "igloo". The cloth ones just get dirty, smelly, and "poopie" and are hard to clean. My guinea pigs tend to chew on the entrances of their igloos, but it's okay. They also chew on their cages, and it's okay too because they need to shorten their teeth because their teeth are ever-growing. <br>  <br>  8. Your guinea pigs need sunshine, so they cannot be in your closet. Leaving your lamp on is not the way to go either. Do not put your guinea pigs in the closet, that is not fair - or right. They need to be in front of a window. <br>  <br>  You can take your guin|`|sGw6FG04aa	ok well for all health questions i would talk to a vet<br>  <br>  as on what to name them i would name one<br>  <br>  Rose<br>  and the other<br>  tibbles|`|AA12208241	1. Bathe them often enough to keep their coats clean. I have a short-hair who we bathe every once in a while but never that often.<br>  <br>  2. We use these wipes for kittens I guess or other small animals. I've tried using pet shampoo but unfortunately my Fonzie is a fighter and doesn't do well with it.<br>  <br>  3. My recommendation: Carefresh. It's paper, it's easy.<br>  <br>  4. I'm not sure, i've never tried.<br>  <br>  5. My piggie eats pellets mixed with dried fruits and pumpkin seeds.(It's some brand of gourmet diet bled we buy at the grocery store). There's always Timothy Hay in the cage because they love it. Fonzie eats oranges, kale, green leaf lettuce, cucumbers, strawberries, carrots, and a few other random things. Your pigs will have certain foods they don't like so pay attention to that. I usually only give him 4 pieces of fruit and veggies a day, because otherwise he skips out on his pellets. Don't feed them any tomatoes or root veggies such as radishes, potatoes, etc. According to the book I have they are bad for their health.<br>  <br>  6. Names aren't my specialty, but my piggies name is Fonzie(if you couldn't guess).<br>  <br>  7. They love to chew so know that now, you're going to get bitten a few times and your clothes and belt buckles will get a few teeth marks and pulls. My piggie pooped on me the first time I held him so just be prepared for that, they can get nervous and poop/pee. <br>  <br>  8. Guinea Pigs love to be social, and while it's good that you're getting two together, they need to be out on a table or something. I usually leave the radio on for mine when I'm gone so that he gets less scared of noises. The closet might not be the best choice. <br>  <br>  The usually need to stretch their legs out, so have them out of the cage at least once a day for at least 30 minutes. I clean the cage out every other day and change the water every day. If your piggies are messy you might have to clean it more often.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hQQuqyYcaa	1. Guinea pigs do not need to be bathed unless they have gotten EXTREMELY messy (something besides water spilled on them, messy rear, etc.) Make sure you brush the long-haired guinea pig at least every other day.<br>  2. It's best to bathe them with a warm, wet washcloth and towel dry.<br>  3. Carefresh works best, but Aspen is ok. NO PINE OR CEDAR!<br>  4. Not true. Their tongue is attached to the inside of their mouth...impossible to swallow it.<br>  5. Constant supply of Timothy hay, small amount of pellets, 1 cup of greens/veggies..small amount of fruit. Make sure they get a slice of orange each day though. Also, they should have vitamin C drops for their water (Oasis brand is good to use..found at most pet stores).<br>  6. Dunno...what names do you like?<br>  7. I've been bitten by ONE guinea pig in the 20 years of handling them. It's rare for them to bite. You should leave it be for about 5-7 days to let it get accustomed to its surroundings.<br>  8. If it's dark during the day, I would recommend leaving a light on.
7Nzvjkbsaa	Since your dog has had diarrhea for so long now, I would use the Veterinary formula the vet has recommended; it is important not to give your dog any other protein source while he is on this food so as to rule out any kind of sensitivity to other protein sources.  However, after looking at the ingredients of the Royal Canin food, I would want to change to a high-quality food after the stomach issues subside.  The first ingredient is potato (not a meat or meat meal) and the second is duck by-product meal.  Animal by-product can mean anything from bones, to feathers, to beaks, to anything you might not want to feed your pet (the 'meal' part just means water has been removed to make the source higher in protein concentration).   But since your vet recommended this food as course of medical treatment you should follow his instructions.<br>  <br>  In addition, I would want to figure out what is causing the diarrhea--not just treat it.  A holistic vet might be a good option for a second opinion.  Holistic vets try to find the source of a problem--not just treat symptoms.  You can find a holistic vet at <a href="http://www.ahvma.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahvma.org</a> (American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association).<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Sounds like you are doing the best you can to take great care of your little guy and I'm sure he'll be just fine.|`|2qVcpkF3aa	Looking at the ingredients it isn't that bad of food. Could be worse. But they do use by products in it. And there should be more higher qaulity of meat. It shoud be the first ingredient and then the potato. There are better foods than this. If it might be allergies then try Wellness Duck and Rice or Venison and Rice. Wellness doesnt use by-products and is a lot better. Try California Natural Herring and Sweet Potato. Do some research  It's trial and error at this point. Good luck!!|`|KxjUim7yaa	I use probiotics and canned pumpkin for my dog. He is allergic to all grains. I usually make his food, but have found Solid Gold Barking at the Moon to be an excellent grain free food. I do not know the Royal Canin, but if it is grain free it should be OK.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	a better choice would be natural balance duck or wellness duck.  the royal canin duck contains by products.|`|gwUMipsUaa	It's probably fine.

They help a lot.|`|1XngLDxyaa	Well, most of the answers you have received are when taking care of founder, not laminitis. Laminitis is a rotation of the bone in the horses hoof, that starts applying pressure to the sole of the hoof. In the ugliest scenarios it can penetrate the sole. Keeping them from grain or high protein will not do anything in regards to laminitis, but will for the metabolic problem. <br>  <br>  In the case of laminitis, you need to get an EXTREMELY knowledgeable farrier. As if the vet said it is not terribly severe that's good, correct shoeing and a bunch of padding can keep the pain down. The farther the soles of her hoof are away from the ground the better. Have bute on hand for days when she is sore (banamine is a more of a  muscle relaxant with a slight pain killer mainly used for colic, it will not relieve the pain from laminitis!), but know laminitis never gets better...just gets worse. You will need to not use her so much in lessons. Too much usage can cause it to become severe much sooner. <br>  <br>  If it was my horse or pony, she would be retired immediately so I would still have many years of companionship left, absolutly no riding, the pressure from riding causes more pressure on a bone that is now abnormal within the horses legs. I have a horse I constantly watch for signs of laminitis because of her history with her legs, and how easily she abscesses in the soles of her hooves.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little. Not really any good news but think about her health first.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I know you didn't ask about feed but this is what we do we have dealt with laminitis.  This works for us.<br>  we feed a low protein hay like a local hay from a field that is not fertilized.   We also feed out horses Sterling pellets which does not cause them to founder if you want a idea of what to feed her when she is better. <br>  How bad is she?  Alot of times you can do corrective shoeing but being that it is a pony Jeff says keep her trimmed short.   Did you ask the vet for some butte? -not sure how to spell it sorry.<br>  <br>   <br>  Jenny|`|jV7SmnaTaa	Typically horses with laminitis problems should be on hay - they should be on quality grass hay and as little grain as possible.  Your vet should have given you suggestions.  If this is a new case (just started today) - then she needs to be on bute.  If this is something old and she has rotation of the coffin bone and you'll need to invest in proper farrier work and probably some shoes.  I would discuss this with your farrier.  Best w|`|5kUxkun3aa	cold hosing and applying ice-packs is said to help reduce the pain.|`|39Kjqp4Faa	You should start by asking your vet to prescribe her some bute. Bute is a dietary supplement used to treat lame horses. Check first though because every horse has different needs. If your horse's hoof is hot you can poultice it. Simply buy the poulticing clay and pack it into her clean hoof, place a damp paper towel over it and wrap the hoof with elastic vet wrap. You can put an easy boot over it if you want to protect it. If your horse is lame in the leg just poultice and wrap with vet wrap just like you treat a hoof. Leave the poultice on for around 2-6 hours. It will get rid of all the swelling. Just hose off the clay when you want to remove it. If the affected area is still warm or if you don't want to poultice you can hose your horse's affected area with cold water for 15 minutes. Stop and let your horse's leg recover for about 15 mins and then you can hose again. You can walk her for a very brief period of time while the leg is cold to reduce any swelling. Hose her leg or hoof every 2-4 hours for 2 fifteen minute periods with 15 minute breaks in between. You can poultice twice a day but I don't recommend leaving it on all night because some horses are crafty with bandages.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck- Hope she feels better!|`|yTvRFSroaa	I also have a horse that is 20 years old and also has laminitis, on the days that she is really bad we give her banimine, you can only get this from your vet so i would consult with your vet about it! Banimine is a painkiller for horses!|`|UyKMwdrAaa	Hi the first few (3) days of founder u can give Banamine it's usually 1 cc per 100 pounds.  Then after that u can use Bute for wt.  to help with the pain.  It's best to have a shoer come and put shoes on her to prevent the coffin bone from shifting too much.  The vet told me to stop giving the grain unless i could use Strategy grain.  Also to only give small amounts.   Also to only feed grass hay not alfalfa.  The horse must never eat green fresh grass again only hay.  When it gets fall and the grass dries out and turns brown then they can go back out on the grass.  She needs to be in a corral or stall where the ground is not lumpy and hard, no rocks.
np5VgFelaa	You can't make an animal be more aggressive. If she is a calm cat, then she is a calm cat. <br>  There is most likely a territory issue going on here. Seperate Sugar from the mom and babies until the babies are adopted out or old enough to not depend on their mother. Then gradually introduce the two adult cats again. There will be hissing/puffing/etc but that should go away in a few days to a few weeks. <br>  <br>  It would also help to have spay your cats, this will help to cut back aggressive and territorial behaviour--as well as benefiting health wise too!
Drnpe4T5aa	Short of calling an exterminator and having them shoot the cat with a tranquilizer dart...  (anyone you send up a ladder, regardless how tall is going to send the cat into hysterics)<br>  I would suggest that you put a large, soft object for the kitty to land on - eg: couch or even a mattress, if you are able to move one there - and put it under the area he is "stuck" in.    <br>  Then, leave out food and water as "bait".   The yummier smelling, the better.  (Tuna or wet cat food)  <br>  Sort of like the kitty stuck in the tree outside, give it a day.  Let the kitty hang out and settle down.  Once things settle down, he will probably come down all on his own, hopefully landing on the soft surface you provided for him.  Once he is down, you could either use a humane trap or just try corralling him out an open door.<br>  I only advise this plan for *one day*.  After that, he can develope fatty liver disease from not eating or drinking, not to mention the negative drawbacks to holding his potty for so long.  <br>  If that happens, call your local humane society or a vet for help.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	call someone to get her down or try getting a longer ladder|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Borrow from a Vet or local animal resuce organiztation, a humane trap.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	If you can borrow a taller ladder that would be the best option.  If not, take a water hose with a spray nozzle and make it "rain" on the cat (gently).  This will cause him to jump down.  12 feet isn't too high for him to make a jump.  Make sure you have the water rain down on him instead of hit him from below.|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Get a long piece of wood and just leave there, he'll come down after a while.

Cfk1kr8Daa	If you know your dog is healthy and the proper weight, that is all you need to know.  She has Whippet in her, and that means she *shouldn't* look like a Lab, or she would be unhealthy.<br>  <br>   Don't worry about what other people think -  you know your dog best. If anyone questions whether or not you are feeding your dog properly, you can politely offer to have them contact your veterinarian.<br>  <br>    Some people are just really concerned for animals' welfare, and that's a good thing, but it goes over the line when they don't know what they're talking about.  And feeding your dog to make them happy would in itself be unsafe for your dog.|`|OWVXKKLdaa	Contrary to popular belief, IAMS is not quality food...<br>  Try Canidae or Taste of the Wild. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/</a><br>  That site gives a list of quality foods... not cheap, but it isn;t full of filler and stuff.<br>  <br>  My dog was a rescue and he looked like he was supposed to be slim, but when we started him on quality food he picked up some healthy weight.

An ideal whippet should look skinny & you should be able to see the back 4 ribs.  However, there are ribs & ribs. Try changing her food to Worker Complete it is formulated for working dogs, I use Wagg which is a cheap brand because Bella won't eat anything else. Has she been spayed yet?  If not don't worry once she has been spayed the vet will tell you to cut down her food by up to 20% if you don't then she will gain quite a lot of weight.  I adopted a battered Whippet 4 years ago & you could see every bone in her body including her 4 broken ribs.  She could eat for England.  Rescue said she had been spayed, then she came into season (fat lot they knew).  Anyway I was advised to give her 2 mugs of food a day when I first got her & reduce it to 1? mugs after spaying.  I carefully followed their instructions she should weigh between 11 &15Kgs for her size she had to go on an unplanned visit to the vets & he weighed her she was 20Kgs, vet was not worried & said she's ok get on with it.  My solution was to cut her food down to 1 mug a day & adopt another Whippet ***** who is now 15 months old she arrived weighing 4kgs & was pityful, she got fed on pasta, minced beef, rice & chicken & within a month was almost 6kgs.  Now puppy weighs around 6kgs & looks much healthier. She is a full pedigree so will probably only weight 10kgs at adult size.

She doesn't like the water but, she lets us do it anyway.... Eventually, your puppy will just get used to an annual bath.. We bathe our dog about once every couple of months.  They don't need a bath unless they get really dirty or muddy... I give lots of treats and praise... Though she's not a fan of water she'll pitifully walk into the bathroom and get into the tub... She looks like a dog on death row...!  We just wet her down gently and watch her eyes and ears.... Give her a good rinse and she's done... <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|gwUMipsUaa	You are doing exactly right.  It just has to take two or three people to help.<br>  <br>  Edit: He should only need a bath about once a month.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	Thats how my dogs were too. I started training them to jump into the tub when there wasn't any water in it just to get use to it. Then eventually I would fill it up and have them jump in, then eventually they graduated to a full blown bath. I would try one of those hand held shower heads as well. <br>  Until I got them to go in on their own, it would take my husband and I to do it. It just took me time!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Bathe him once a month, he will get used to it. Have 2 friends help you. Give him a treat afterward. In nice weather perhaps you can do it outside.|`|uEyxjAdcaa	I will no longer complain about my 60 pound full grown Golden Retriever who has decided she's a lap dog.<br>  <br>  I think you're doing everything you can do.|`|eidGiG3Kaa	Your doing everything right. The only thing I could suggest is to try to reward and distract the dog while he is in the tub. Most dogs are food motivated. Obviously you are going to need an extra special treat to over come the dogs anxiety during bath time. Grill up some chicken or beef and cut into small bite size pieces. First give the dog a small piece to let him know how delicious it is. Then have him follow you up into the bathroom and give him another piece. This is where it can become tricky because the dog might already sense it’s going to get a bath. Have everyone get the dog into the tub and start scrubbing him. Continue to give the dog his tasty treats while he is being bathed. If it’s to hectic and crazy to feed the dog at the same time hes getting his bath wait until the end of the bath and while he remains inside the tub feed him the treats. Hopefully, the dog will stop associating the bath as a horrible experience or hopefully the treats will distract him enough to allow you to bath the pooch with a little more ease. There is the possiblity that the dog will be so stressed out he will refuse to eat anything. <br>  <br>  You might also want to take the dog for a very long walk before his bath. Hopefully he will be more tired out and wont have his full strength to fight you during the bath.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|a9jMOJeHaa	its remind me my lab....just the first time i try to get him a bath when he was big and i feld in the bathtub with him.my lab like more shower than tub,so u can try with that or sometimes i just put my swimming suit and get in with him so he can see that there is nothing wrong,try to talk to him like normal or sing,mine love it and i take him bath 1 every 2 weeks|`|i9gxfUQtaa	i say don't use the bath tub any more.  i have 2 pit mixes and when ever they need it i spray them with a "wipe down" type shampoo i get from the pet store. spray them in sections and wipe them with a towel. i start with neck- spray and wipe, then a shoulder and leg, and work my way back.  this keeps my dogs calm and still so i can do it by my self and it leaves their skin clean and smelling fresh.|`|nZcAplJEaa	OK well you could try filling a baby pool in the yard and do that or you could give him treats while he is in the tub. Haha spoiled much, but it works.<br>  And remember, dogs can sense emotion. If you are stressed the dog will be to. Just try to stay calm. Also my husband has a Boxer and I found it better to bathe hime with a shower head nozzle.<br>  Best Answer?|`|QLopvWKDaa	...verrry carefullyy...  ; )|`|XVCtwLjsaa	i would try a shower head

People who think THEIR dogs and another dog would make the cutest dogs in the world are the reason the shelters are full.  Your dog certainly doesn't want to go through the discomfort of having a litter, she is fine the way she is.  It is a selfish act on your part and that's all it is.  Give her a break and have her fixed.  Isn't it enough to just have her and enjoy her?|`|mOW13kISaa	I'd say yeah if you knew you'd be able to find good homes for any puppies that came.

Also, you would have to decide on whethere you want short hair or long hair, because they come both ways.  <br>  Look up both sizes of dachshunds online at akc.org, and read about them and then decide which is best for you.

hQQuqyYcaa	The female should be of the same size as the male.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	I would not do it. Bearded dragons are solitary reptiles and should not be housed together unless for breeding purposes. 2 females, one will become the dominate one  thus stressing the other one to the point of not eating, 2 males will fight and could cause death or severe injury,  and the obvious with male female are eggs and babies and he too could stress her out the the point of ill health. Do you have enough cages for all those babies as well as lights and an endless supply of crickets?|`|bmKY5OMSaa	It not really about age its about grams you need the beardie about 275 grams for male and 300 grams for female.? If you get a female are you ready to breed do you have the money for the incubator and 30eggs every month for up to 1 year and after he gets her you need to separate her from him because he will breed her to deat and after one time you get alot of eggs and alot of babies out of one of my breadie got hit one time we take them out and she lays between? 30 to 50 eggs every 30 days his sperm stays inside of her for 1 year then you need tanks only keep 5 babies in the tank so they don't get picked on and food and roaches blow through about 100? 3x times aday breeding is very time consuming and expensive.? and when they lock on the male changes and turns mean and it can kill your female that is why you must bulk the girl up so she won't get hurt  I hope this helps you if you want to know more email me.

Pet rocks, perhaps.|`|AA11244754	no I don't but I know that my reason for wanting and getting a dog is for companionship but at least I know instead of running to the Y A to call a vet about certain things such as if my dog is limping, when I call to make an appt., to ask how much it's going to cost before I go.  I've seen posts on hear that really cause me pause as to how some people can care for themselves when they ask what they need in order to care for a dog and don't even have the sense to call their vet to get estimates for puppy vaccinations, spaying or neutering of their dog.

09e41Hdwaa	Yes, it sounds like you will be getting an egg.  You should separate them so they won't breed.  Breeding isn't something you should do unless you have done a lot of research, know how to hand feed, and have a vet fund.<br>  <br>  Watch the female for egg binding, if you can see the egg in her it should be coming out soon.|`|R68afrPeaa	Your female parakeet should be picking out some feathers, not a whole lot, and yes , thats because shes ready to build a nest.  I think your just about ready to become a parrakeet grandmother!  Are you ready for this?    Are you thinking about hand-feeding? IT's a good decision, but it's not for everyone. If you do decide to, make sure you know about everything that can possible go wrong. YOu don't have to handfeed though.  After the babies are weaned, you must take them out of the nest and play with them! This is the only way that they will make good pets, and they will be socialized.<br>  Good luck!

XoknFyNvaa	I don't know your dog, but the breed has nothing to do with it. You need to know how to introduce the dog to a new family member. Try visiting a local high school or new mothers course and ask if you can borrow one of those fake babies. This will be the best training tool that you can use. You have plenty of time to train the dog to be fine with the baby. In fact many dogs pick up a motherly instinct with children if they are trained properly. NEVER leave the dog unattended with the child. <br>  <br>  If you do feel as though you are putting your family members in danger, try rehoming the Pit Bull while you have time. Do not wait until it is too late and drop it off at a shelter. You need to do the training well before you bring this baby home.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	I would make sure this dog goes through all sorts of training before and after the baby is born.<br>  <br>  I do not have a problem with pit bulls but that is a powerful dog and you want to make sure things are going to go well.<br>  <br>  Dog and Baby are to never be in the same area together....and never alone.<br>  <br>  Pit bulls are very strong and when the baby is young and walking around she could easily get hurt by the dog knocking her over.<br>  <br>  If this is not a tolerant dog and she steps on him or trips on him it could get ugly.<br>  <br>  Any signs that this dog does not like the baby....any growling toward the baby.....any snapping at the baby<br>  <br>  <br>  The dog has to go at that point.<br>  <br>  (And I don't believe in giving up a dog just because of a baby or because they don't get a long but that is a strong powerful dog.   And I don't feel safe having a baby around that kind of dog)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know your dog and i don't know what kind of owners you are so its just going to be on whether or not the dog is good with kids and whether or not you all can supervise both dog and young child at the same time all the time.     <br>  <br>  I knew a family who had a pit bull that slept at the end of their oldest daughters bed from the time she was 4 no problems|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I wouldn't be worried as long as you take proper precautions. I am due next month and was given a few pointers from people. Like if the dog is use to being on the couch and it wont be allowed when the baby arrives, then stop letting him on the couch now so he doesn't associate the baby with "taking his place." If he does great with other kids I wouldn't worry at all just make sure to still give him attention so jealously doesn't kick in and a bunch of reading up on it, you have time!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	if your dog loves children, i wouldnt be too concerned. work on some training before hand, such as getting a baby doll and putting a diaper and other baby smelling stuff on it, then walk around your house carrying it to see how he reacts. just basic training stuff, if you are still concerned consider contacting a trainer|`|AA10686973	I have a pit bull and a baby.  When my grand niece was born he was two years old.  He would lay at the foot of her bed and bark at us when she would cry.  He would cuddle her when she was on the floor and walk right beside her when she was learning to walk.  He would put himself between her and any person he did not know when they came up to her while outside.  Any dog, no matter the bree can be kind and gentle with a baby.  Never leave a baby alone with any large dog.  Media would have you believe pit bulls maul or kill a child everyday.  More children are hurt and killed by their parents than by all dog breeds.|`|3hIeHGcHaa	it does not matter what kind of dog you have if there are any babys around.

Just a few tips, include the dog let him in the baby's room(before he gets here) let him smell everything. When the baby is born before he comes home bring something that the baby has worn, a blanket, a shirt and let the dog smell it. Don't make the baby some "forbidden object" Im not saying put the baby on the floor with the dog but don't act like he can NEVER see, sniff or look at the baby. Make sure you pay a little extra attention to the dog too, it can be stressful to add a new family member!|`|jV7SmnaTaa	It depends on the dog and how responsible you guys are as owners. A dog...any dog...should never be left alone with a small child or baby. Some pitbulls are happy delightful creatures - but others are aggressive and are not good family dogs. Small children have a tendancy to push, pull and prod dogs - so, your mom will need to be very diligent at watching the child as it grows up and the dog will need to be tolerant. If not, find better suited home. I think it's really hard to mix pets with small children - when you have a baby your life tends to revolve around the baby and the animals get neglected. I wish you the best...|`|nBehRANyaa	If the dog is well trained and socialized, and views the human members of the family as his pack leaders, most likely he will be just fine.  If you're not sure, start working with a trainer now.<br>  <br>  No dog, no matter what size or breed or temperament, should ever be left unsupervised with a baby or young child.  Even for a moment.|`|fPLv0QrSaa	Here is a tip. Treat the Pit Bull in the same way a young child might. Pat him on the head, pull his legs and tail, etc... If he doesn't have a bad reaction, give him treats. Make it a game. When a child does it (even though they aren't supposed to) the dog will think it is no big deal. Pit Bulls are great around children although the media would have you believe they were bred to eat children.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Yeah. I'd make sure that the dog is actually conditioned and prepared for the kids "arrival".  Lots of serious EXPERT literature on this topic. Do not look for garbage opinions here.<br>  Late Entry : just like the "answer" above.<br>  Later and Last entry : the breed actually matters. believe it or not. the "expert" here have no idea. seek help from a local trainer or behaviourist (unless you trust yourself)|`|EDiJe38Taa	Ok, how does your dog react to children? To strangers? If it acts questionable around either then I would be concerned. My pit, on the other hand, loves kids and loves strangers unless it feels threatened. I had no worries bringing my newborn home from the hospital. The moment I set the baby down in his carseat, she went up to him and gave him a kiss. It all depends on your dog's disposition.|`|34uWa9kHaa	To help the dog adjust let him sniff all the new baby things you will be bringing in the home, let it check out the babies nursery.   Set boundries outside the nursery door etc.    <br>  <br>  When baby is born take something to the hospital like a  blanket  wrap baby in it for awhile  <br>  <br>  Then bring it home and let the dog sniff that too.    That will help him to learn someone new is going to be coming home.   He will be curious but remember to correct him also.<br>  <br>  Never let him alone unsupervised the baby, he may try to "help" it if it starts crying and that is where most of these disasters happen.  Unattended childrent with large dogs that wanted to help not harm the child. <br>  <br>  You will have a great nanny dog.   I own 4 of them.

jV7SmnaTaa	I work at a vet.  We are a large clinic and see alot of dogs.  I can think of two pitbulls that are fabulous dogs that are happy delightful creatures!  However, I can think of about a dozen others that are kennel and owner protective to the point where they can be dangerous.  I think that if a dog has a good breeding history and is properly socialized as a puppy they can be great dogs - I think a lot of irresponsible people tend to be their owners and don't take it seriously.  I don't think pitbulls are bad - and I know that in pretty much every breed of dog there are some aggressive dogs (lol, I get growled at by plenty of dachshunds) - I think that some owners of breeds need to take their responsibility very seriously.  The fact that you're asking this questions probably means that you are one of the very responsible owners that has a great dog and has worked very hard.  Best wishes...|`|4ObhfxoIaa	I love my pitbull! <br>  She's such a sweetie and has never been aggressive or bitten someone ever.<br>  All she wants to do is cuddle with you and lick you.|`|giCUEYsJaa	I rescued mine.<br>  <br>  She was actually used as bait in an illegal pit bull fighting ring before I adopted her.   We changed her name to Wrinkles, because of all her face wrinkles and we should have called her cuddles or huggy.  The most affectionate dog I have ever owned.<br>  <br>  No, she has never bit another person or dog.  I bring the boxer from across the street over for play dates 3 x a week so she is very socialized.  I love to watch them "box" each other - very cute.  I also have another dog who is 14 years old and she is very sweet to her too.  As a matter of fact, since I brought Wrinkles home, I have noticed a quicker step in our ole girl.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend this breed to RESPONSIBLE owners.|`|AA10686973	My pit as never bitten anyone, his ply pals are a rabbit and a kitten, his best friend a ginnie pig die of old age.  He plays with my grand niece all the time.  I know a number of people  who own pits and not one of them as ever bitten anyone, with the expect of big boy who tore into a guy threatening to kill his owner.  Guy broke into the house hit his wife, had is little girl by the neck and was pointing a gun at the father, think he had the right to put th S.O.B in the hospital.  You know those who gather the stats on dog bites believe that in a least 75% of the time people as missed ID ed the breed of dog as pit bull.  Seems the media as made people believe if it attacks its a pit bull.  I know a number of AC officers and in all the calls about dog attacks only 2% are pit bulls and most of those involve abuse of the dog|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I own one and it was my husbands choice to get her. I was apprehensive because of all the stories, but I have truly grown to love her. She isn't at all aggressive towards people, we have friends with toddlers who she follows around (she found out that kids=food) and is an AWESOME dirty diaper detector (hehe). She has been poked in the eyes, tail pulled.. the stuff that comes with kids that you can't always stop even though we do watch them very closely. She did bite our neighbors dog when she was in heat over a ball, our neighbors dog is a female so we think thats why because they played almost everyday and she just got bitchy in heat. <br>  They do take a firm, fair hand but I now plan on always owning one.|`|V5DON3XGaa	My neighbor had one who mauled my little cousin. She no longer has the dog because it was euthanized. My cousin no longer has a cute face.<br>  <br>  I get a thumbs down because I don't lie? OK my cousin has these adorable scars all over her face! It is so cute how she looks all deformed. And it is just a hoot when all of the kids on the playground point and laugh at her!|`|3hIeHGcHaa	yes i know some one who has a pit pul and yes he is very aggressive and it has bit some one b4  and no i do not like this breed because they are so aggressive and no i don't have one but my neighbor has one so i hope this information helped you sorry if it didn't|`|3hBQz33Yaa	I personally have never owned one but my neigbor did. He was the sweetest dog very loving, playful, and well behaved. The owner loved the dog took the dog places with him, walked him, spent a lot of time with him. Then one day somebody elses pits in town got loose and mauled my neighbors pit. My neighbors pit ended up having to be put to sleep because the vet said he wouldn't recover. The owner of the pits who mauled my neighbors was very neglectful towards them and even the wife was scared of them. This goes to show that its the owners and not the breed. I think pits get a bad rep because so many horrible owners have been neglectful and trained them as fighting dogs and those are the stories you hear about in the media. I've met many pits that very sweet and kind natured.|`|9POUmVMGaa	I love this breed. I do not personally own one (parents won't let me get another animal) but I work with them all the time at Pound Dog Rescue. Out of the many pitbulls only one has bitten someone but we believe she was heavily abused and that was her natural defense if she though someone was going to harm her (I've seen a Chihuahua do the same thing). They are very sweet dogs that are great family pets if you train them right|`|34uWa9kHaa	I own 4.  They are great family dogs and clowns.   If any of mine ever showed human aggression they would be put to sleep.  Mine have never bit anyone and if they do unprovoked they will be PTS.   If they are protecting their family (which I don't see happening they are chickens) they will get a steak.  <br>  <br>   No responsible Pit Bull owner will keep a human aggressive dog alive.  It is not in the Pit Bulls nature to be human aggressive.<br>  <br>  Dog aggression may or may not show but none of mine are dog aggressive either.|`|ZnZSVPztaa	Pitbulls are not a breed. The American Pit Bull Terrier is a breed. Pitbull is just a term used to describe a group of dogs. And being agressive is just a stereotype. The only reason why a dog may be agressive is because of their OWNERS. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|wUg7iYU1aa	Yes i like the breed or else i wouldnt own them...I own 3 now and was raised around them i have never seen a Pit bite anyone, Pit Bulls are not human aggressive.

She has never bitten anyone, I could stick my hand down her throat if I had to!! lol They get a bad rap and I am tired of it!! My pit plays with my boston terrier all the time and never hurts him! I think the boston is the boss, not the pit!!!|`|EDiJe38Taa	Love the breed. The one I have now is the third I have owned (first one got sick and had to put to sleep, second one we gave to a friend because he was lonely). My dog has never bitten anyone. I don't know anyone who has one that has bitten. She is not aggressive unless someone acts aggressive towards her. Even then, she will just bark not bite.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	I have a Rottweiler American Staffordshire Terrier mix ("pitbull" can mean any one of several breeds ... if your question is specific to one of those breeds then you need to say so)<br>  Before we got our girl at the shelter I wasn't sure if I would like a bully breed dog, just because I don't usually like short hair breeds. Now I am a total convert. Her coat is so soft and silky, she is one of the smartest dogs I have ever had, she is gentle and sweet beyond compare, she is just a great dog!<br>  No, she has never bitten anyone and no I do not personally know anyone who's "pitbull" breed dog has bitten anyone. I know several people who have/had Labs, Golden Retrievers, and German Sheperds who were/are aggressive and have bitten people.|`|i9gxfUQtaa	i have 2. a chow/pit mix who is 10y/o and a german shepherd pit mix who is a lil over 1y/o.<br>  <br>  this breed along with every other dog breed can be aggressive if mistreated, under socialized, neglected, inbreeding or improper breeding, or trained to be that way.  because of the dogs size and mandible(jaw) size, it is a popular dog for dog fights.  due to this we have criminals breeding the dogs for aggressive temperaments(allot of times with inbreeding) which give the dogs a bad reputation.  also, dog owners who are not prepared for the breeds natural dominant behavior let their dogs run a muck.  <br>  <br>  all of this can occur with any breed, not just pits.  i had a neighbor who was evicted because he had an aggressive yorkie.  the fact that his dog was aggressive was not the problem, the issue came up because he was not a responsible dog own and would "lose control" over his dog and it would run around the complex biting people, dogs, and children!<br>  <br>  i again have 2 pit mixes.  both have aggression issues. <br>  <br>   my older dog is only aggressive if she feels her dominance is being challenged.  because of this i do not let her sniff other dogs unless i know they are submissive dogs, i only let children 11 or older pet her as small children are eye level to her and may stare as well as panic and try to run.<br>  <br>  my younger dog has fear aggression.  due to this i walk her with a muzzle, i do not allow strangers to pet her. i use positive reinforcement to keep her calm on walks when strangers pass. and i know where her stress threshold is and i do not exceed what she can handle.<br>  <br>  mind you, both of my dogs are rescue dogs and were severely abused causing these issues, they weren't born like this.  people did this to them.  they are wonderful and loving pets and i would give my life for them.  to insure they and the community stay i take every and all measures to insure no one would ever have grounds to take my babies away.<br>  <br>  long story short.  pits can be aggressive, not because they are pits, but because people are irresponsible
3giaPYe8aa	Some b*tches "tuck up" pretty good, and others stay pretty saggy for life, especially if they have had more than one litter.  As for the actual size of the nipple....that will never be the same as a b*tch that has never went in heat or had a litter.  Heck, that's what pregnancy does to a woman.  lol|`|tPGxPDvBaa	They won't go back to the size they were before.  Most likely they might shrink a lil bit more but they are probably the size they are going to be.|`|AA11244754	Since she's still lactating it could be a while.  YOu do know that pups are usually weaned at 6 weeks, so it will be after that some times sooner sometimes it could take a while.

q2ekDMwtaa	First of all, 30 of any type of fish is too much for a 10 gallon tank.  To properly have a fish tank stocked to where the fish are comfortable is one inch of fish per gallon of water.  So, depending on the size of the fish, multiply their length in inches by the number of fish, and that will tell you the proper size tank that would be required to house these fish.  <br>  <br>  The rule of thumb for gravel is one pound of gravel for gallon, but if you already have gravel, and aren't sure of the weight, then 2-3 inches will do.  The gravel will need to be washed well before being added into the tank. <br>  <br>  You can use tap water to fill up the tank in conjunction with a water conditioner that can be purchased at any local fish store or anywhere that sells fish supplies.  The directions on the bottle will let you know how much is required per gallon of water.  <br>  <br>  As far as transfer goes, you will need to cycle whichever tank that you are going to use for at least a few days.  Ideally, it should cycle for at least a week, but if it's an urgency to get them in sooner, a few days should suffice.  Just in case you are unsure of what cycling is, once the gravel and water has been added, the filter should be turned on and running for this period of time before the fish are introduced.  <br>  <br>  The fish can be put into bags of their pond water and floated in the tank they are going to be transferred for about a half hour or more to adjust to the temperature.  While floating, water from the tank should be added to the bag containing the fish and the pond water to slowly introduce the water from the tank to the fish as to not shock the fish too much from such a drastic change.  Water should then be partially dumped out from the bag into the sink as more water from the tank is introduced until the entire bag is virtually tank water.  Then the fish can be introduced into the tank.|`|XAsR6uPvaa	fish store tanks are bigger than 10gals, and the tanks look overcrowded as it is >_><br>  <br>  30 goldfish in a small 10gal is an extremely bad idea.<br>  Water will turn really, really bad on the first day.<br>  Fish will begin to die extremely fast.<br>  <br>  Find a way to keep the heron away is your best option.|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	Gold fish are pretty easy to keep although you may need a larger tank. <br>  Lots of filtration.

When fish come to the top gasping, it means they are suffocating.<br>  <br>  Best way to fix this is to buy a good airpump and air stone.  Depending on the size of your tank, prices vary from $15(both pump and stone) to over $100.  <br>  <br>  Next, <br>  <br>  Get a chemical tester.  If any of the nitrite, nitrate, or ammonia levels are too high, this will cause them to be in great pain and will eventually kill them.<br>  <br>  What size tank do you have/how many/which types of fish do you have?

While small, as they are very slow growers, you can keep them in around 40-55 gallons minimum, in a group of at least 3-4-5 or so. As they mature they'll need more like a 6ft tank minimum. You need a long term plan with these fish!<br>  <br>  They are also prone to parasites such as Ich so water quality must be kept on top of. They are primarily carnivorous so feed sinking foods like bloodworm.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	They should be kept in groups of at least five, grow a foot long, and require no less than 100 gallons as adults.|`|KyGhcrzLaa	The clown loach, Chromobotia macracanthus, is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Cobitidae (loach) family. It is the sole member of the Chromobotia genus. It originates in inland waters in Indonesia on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. It is a popular fish in the freshwater aquarium trade and is sold worldwide. [1]The fish was first described as Cobitis macracanthus by Pieter Bleeker in 1852. In 1989, its scientific name was changed to Botia macracanthus.[2] In 2004, Dr. Maurice Kottelat divided the Botia genus, containing 47 different species, into seven separate genera, resulting in the clown loach being placed in a genus of its own, Chromobotia.[3]<br>  The genus Chromobotia derives its name from the Greek word chromo, meaning "colour", and the regional Asian word botia, meaning "warrior" or "soldier"; the specific epithet Macracanthus is derived from the Greek word macros, meaning "large" and the Latin word acanthus, meaning "thorny", referring to the large spine below each of the fish's eyes. The common name, "clown loach" comes from the fish's bright colors and stripes (many tropical fish with stripes that stand out are commonly called a clown).<br>  Information about the maximum size of the clown loach varies, with some estimates ranging from 11 to 14 inches (40 to 50 cm), and with typical adult sizes ranging from 7 to 10 inches (15 to 20 cm).[4] The fish's body is long and laterally compressed, with an arched dorsal surface and a flat ventral surface. Its head is relatively large and its mouth faces downward with thick, fleshy lips, and four pairs of barbels. The barbels on the lower jaw are small and difficult to see. Clown loaches can make a clicking sound when they are happy or angry.<br>  The body is whitish-orange to reddish-orange, with three thick, black, triangular, vertical bands. The anterior band runs from the top of the head and through the eye, the medial band lies between the head and the dorsal fin, and wraps around to the ventral surface, and the posterior band covers almost all of the caudal peduncle and extends to the anal fin. There is some regional color variation within the species; the pelvic fins on fish from Borneo are reddish orange and black, while the pelvic fins on fish from Sumatra are entirely reddish orange.[5]<br>  The fish is sexually dimorphic, with females being slightly plumper than males. In addition, the tips of the tail on the male curve inwards slightly, whereas the females have straight tips.[2]<br>  The fish has a movable spine that lies in a groove below the eye, which may be extended as a defense mechanism. The spine may cause a painful wound, but is not venomous. It also may be used as a predation tool, set close to the mouth, and contributing to a certain orderliness that a healthy Chromobotia pack will bring to your aquarium.Clown loaches are native to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia. Clear stream environments provide the optimal habitat for clown loaches, but biannual monsoon flooding forces the fish to move into flooded flood plains, or murky or blackwater rivers or lakes, for 7-8 months of the year, and clown loaches are commonly found in the flood plains of hilly areas.[6] Breeding adults migrate to smaller waterways to spawn annually.[4]<br>  In its native habitat, the fish is found in water with a temperature range of 77 to 86 °F (25 to 30 °C), a pH between 5.0 and 8.0, and water hardness between 5 and 12 dH.[1]A harmless, very active and sociable fish, clown loaches are best kept in groups of 3-4 or more. Due to their potentially large size, a 60 to 100 gallon (230 to 380 litre) aquarium should be the minimum size used.<br>  These fish have bifurcated subocular (located under the eyes) spines, which are used as a defence mechanism and for obtaining prey. If a loach deploys its spines while caught in a net, untangling it is difficult and can result in injury to the handler or the fish. Aquarists recommend that large specimens are double or triple bagged, or placed in a solid container when being moved.<br>  When kept in groups smaller than 5, clown loaches may spend lots of time hiding under obstacles in the water. Tiger barbs and Panda corydoras, Corydoras panda associate happily with clown loaches, and the three fish may school together.<br>  Clown loaches make clicking noises when they are excited or during feeding. This sound is produced by the grinding of their pharyngeal teeth. Sometimes clown loaches swim on their sides, or upside down, and appear ill, or lie on their sides on the bottom of the tank and appear to be dead. This is normal behaviour but the aquarist should be aware of it to avoid removing healthy fish from the aquarium.<br>  If clown loaches do not come out of hiding, there are some easy things to adjust so that the clown loaches will be more comfortable. A good tank setup for a clown loach should include ample shade, real plants, hiding places and other peaceful fishes. Make sure the environment is not too bright initially. Provide shade fr|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	first off they get big 12" in an aquarium 18" in the wild, but grow slow. They should be kept in small groups 4 is good.

ZBMwMauKaa	it's not a good idea to just let them run free. someone could get seriously hurt and then you have a problem on your hands. i would alternate on isolating them and only allow supervised gatherings.|`|d17c36358b6e44ed4ccea9a3d9083189aa	For the fight thing you can not just leave them alone when they fight or else it will just get worse. You need to get a cheap spray bottle and spray them when they fight.
AxENuJahaa	Any avian vet should be able to clip your birds wings.  Also a GOOD groomer could also do this.  What kind of bird?  Clipping a bird's wings is a fairly simple procedure.  The vet should only charge their normal office visit fee.  A groomer may charge anywhere from nothing to $20.00 depending on the groomer and the type of bird.  I clip my own birds' wings and always have.|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	i wouldnt if i were you.<br>  then your bird wouldnt be able to fly, and thats not fun for them<br>  :(|`|R68afrPeaa	It is a really simple task to do, adn once you learn , you won't ever have to learn again. <br>  Make sure you go to petco, or an avian vet, just to make sure you know how, and then try it yourself. MAKE sure that you don't trim too much, then your bird won't be able to get around, Also, have Bird blood clotting stuff, ( flour will work too ) so if you hit a bird feather, it won't keep bleeding. If you do happen to hit a blood feather, pull the feather out immediatly with a tweezers. If you don't , the bird could die.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.animalsheltering.org/resource..." rel="nofollow">http://www.animalsheltering.org/resource...</a>

None at all?  Thats really weird..  IF she picked them out herself, she would still have feathers on her head.  Maybe another bird had picked them out?  I'd try to take it somewhere.

Does it have any signs of new growth?|`|JoT6sYRUaa	ok all i can think of is when birds are sad and stressed they pick there feathers out, so she probably didn't have it good in her last home and picked all her feathers out, if you dont think that could be it take her to the vet.
FtEkredUaa	If you feel comfortable on her then go for it, don't worry about it. Im sure a 13.3 will be fine for you. I have a 13hh that jumps 4ft3 and im only 5ft2. You are only a few inches taller, and your horse is a few inches taller then mine. Don't worry as long as you are comfortable on her and she is going well for you go for it! Don't let anything pull you back. Your instructor also would not put you on a pony she thinks you are to big for. Go with what your instructor says. But personally i think you are fine!!|`|q6PZfUM1aa	Well your weight isn't a problem so that's good. You might be a little tall for  her but its not a huge issue i say that if you grow another 3 or more inches you may want to give her up its hard to say without a picture but from you description i would say go ahead a ride her!! I may suggest depending on how old you are you may want to just lease her for now because if your only like 13 you could grow 5 inches in 6 months to a year and then you would have an extra horse on your hands.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Well, your weight isn't too much.<br>  <br>  But you are a bit tall... which isn't a load problem... it just might not look right for shows, or just in general.

You will be too big to look good together, but this combination is possible. Lucy sounds like a super pony, but she is not right for you. She is better for someone who is actually short, you are average. you sound like you know you will be growing so a horse around 15.3 hands will be the best for you. Don't feel obligated to buy a pony becuase she is great. Many people like to deny the horse doesn't fit because it is so great, but you can find the right size horse for you that is the perfect size. You have to consider that when you outgrow Lucy you will want a horse, but could you afford Lucy and a horse int this economy. Keep ridign the pony becuase you have the privelage to. Enjoy the time with her, but she is better off elsewhere. I think you will find a horse that is great for you and thank yourself for letting Lucy go elsewhere! Good Luck!
R68afrPeaa	I guess i will answer this again<br>  <br>  Ok, so my Green Cheek Conure went throught the same thing, twice, and now has all his feathers back. Poor bird.<br>  <br>  First you need to ask yourself, did anythign provoke this behavior? Did you get a new pet, or a new job etc. that you are not spending enough time with your quaker? That might just be it. Is she stressed? Do you keep her by a window, maybe shes mad that the weather is changing.<br>  <br>  ONe thing that might help is if you bring her into a nearby bird store. The birdstore i work at would glady babysit any bird. <br>  There is a product called "better bitters" , and it's a horrible tasting spray that you spray over your birds feathers. Make sure that you don't get it on your hands. It may stop from taking out more feathers.<br>  <br>  With my conure, all he needed was time. I went away for a while, and he plucked him self, so there were no more feathers to pull. Pretty soon, he stopped, and he started to grow back new ones. Then , he didn't even bother to pull thos out, and he stopped completly. First time this happened, i cried because i thought that i was being a horrible bird owner., so don't feel bad. <br>  ONe thing that may also help is that wherever you go, around the house, take her with you. I mean liek if your just watching t.v, let her on your shoulder, and if you see her, just tell her to knock it off. <br>  IF all else fails, contact me again, and i might be able to help!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1gDTiPVyaa	I've never had this problem with my birds--none of mine have been pluckers, but I'll give you a couple of websites you may not have found yet and wish you good luck.

Because when feather plucking starts out of no where, an avian veterianarian really should be consulted with. Parrots can sometimes exhibit or not exhibit signs of illness pending on the illness. Also, has anything traumatic happened or any new additions in your home been added that you know of? Sudden feather destructive behavior can be brought on by somethign very stressful like a traumatic event, to something as simple as something new in the bird's environment. The latter can often be the case so any new aspects should be considered. Also, is it just feather plucking or have you noticed if there is any self mutilation occuring also?

AA10063288	Cats need a sanctuary space away from people, pets and noise for awhile after being introduced to a new home. Please let your kitten hide and just offer food and water. Make sure to jiggle the food bag so she can hear you and same with her litter. If you can catch her, segregate her to a bedroom with her food and litterbox. She'll be much more comfortable. Give her some blankets with your smell on them. Then, let her come out on her own terms. Cats are funny creatures, but it is so rewarding to own them.|`|iYzmnIsJaa	Keep her in one small room and block places so she cannot hide for a day or two.  Then slowly take her around the house.  Bathrooms with a closed toilet and no dangerous chemicals around for her to get into might be a place to start.  Have litter box on one side of room, and food and fresh water on other side.<br>  <br>  Play with her gently & quietly.  During play sessions, pet her gently, play, pick her up and give her a kiss, put her down & continue playing.  Do this at least 20 times a day (gently/briefly pick her up and stroke her back, tummy, a foot, tickle her chin, give her a kiss --- do one of those things quickly & briefly.)  She'll associate you with fun, and affection.  Get her to fetch.  Cats love shoe strings.  Put all string toys safely away when you are not there to supervise play, so she doesn't decide to eat it in a silly cat moment.|`|PqPc10Fgaa	Good nutrition and a balanced diet are essential for health. People often ask me what they should feed their cats. Over the years, I have made some observations on the health of cats fed an enormous variety of diets. Here are some of my conclusions.<br>  <br>  In the last few years, raw meat diets have become popular. I am hesitant to recommend them because I have seen several catteries contaminated with Salmonella infection which I believe was caused by feeding raw meat. All of the known vitamins, present in raw meat, have been supplemented in name-brand diets. <br>  <br>  Cats have not evolved from strict meat eaters in the way dogs have. In their nutritional needs, cats are much the same as their wild ancestors. They are particularly well suited to digesting animal protein but unable to utilize dietary fiber. Cats do best on a diet, which is twenty percent protein, nine percent fat thirty-five percent carbohydrates and a maximum of ten percent fiber. <br>  <br>  Cats are not big drinkers. They drink less than dogs do – possibly because they descend from desert sand cats. This may also be the cause of their susceptibility to urine crystals and subsequent lower urinary tract disease.<br>  <br>  Canned vs. Dry Cat Foods<br>  <br>  Given their choice, most cats prefer canned diets. The aroma, flavor and palatability of dry diets do not match that of canned. Cats are creatures of habit and quickly get accustomed to a flavor and consistency of diet to the exclusion of all others. Which ever you buy, be sure the label says that the diet meets the National Research Council’s guidelines on feline nutrition and is certified by the Association of American Feed Control Officials. Over the years I have found that cats fed dry diets have less tartar build up on their teeth and less gum disease surrounding the teeth. With time, gum inflammation associated with canned diets causes the tissues surrounding the teeth to recede and the teeth to loosen. With time, bacteria moving through the blood stream from infected gums cause damage to the kidneys and liver. Dry cat foods have greater caloric density – that is they are richer. This is because canned food contains about 75% water. I do not suggest semi-moist diets because of the large amount of preservatives they contain.<br>  <br>  How Much To Feed Your Cat<br>  <br>  Cats vary greatly in the amount of food necessary for optimal weight and health. Most adult cats I see are overweight. Overweight cats store their fat on their tummies so they may not appear fat to their owners. Growing cats and kittens require considerably more food per pound body weight to thrive than adults or senior cats do. The following table is an estimate of how much your cat should eat. It is not precise because the compositions of various brands differ<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Age Body Weight Ounces of Dry Food Ounces of Canned Food <br>  10 weeks 2.0-2.4 lbs 2.5-3.0 oz 7.3-8.9 oz <br>  20 weeks 4.2-5.5 lbs 2.8-3.7 oz 8.0-10.5 oz <br>  30 weeks 5.5-8.4 lbs 2.8-4.2 oz 8.1-12.4 oz <br>  40 weeks 6.4-8.4 lbs 2.6-3.4 oz 7.6-9.9 oz <br>  Adult Active 4.8-9.9 lbs 2.0-4.0 oz 5.7-11.8 oz <br>  Adult Inactive 4.8-9.9 lbs 1.7-3.2 oz 5.0-10.3 oz <br>  Senior Adult 4.8-9.9 lbs 2.3-4.3 oz 6.7-7.7 oz <br>  Pregnancy 5.5-8.0 lbs 2.8-4.4 oz 8.1-13.0 oz <br>  Giving Milk*  4.8-8.8 lbs 6.1-11.1 oz 17.8-32.4 oz <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  Nutrient Requirements of Cats<br>  <br>  <br>  Cats are natural meat eaters and cannot be maintained on vegetarian diets or diets that rely heavily on grains. Such diets are deficient in essential amino acids, fatty acids and vitamins. Cats are finicky eaters who choose their foods on the basis of taste, aroma, texture and moisture content rather than meeting their nutritional needs. <br>  Cats are unusual in that they cannot convert the carotenes found in leafy plants into vitamin A as humans can. Their natural source of vitamin A is liver. Vitamin A is necessary for membrane health. Cats deficient in vitamin A are more susceptible to respiratory tract infections, eye and skin disease. Niacin or nicotinic acid is also essential to your cat’s health. A lack of niacin causes inflammation of the intestines, rough skin and hair coat, oral ulcers and increased susceptibility to infection. Most mammals can synthesize niacin from the amino acid, triptophan. Cats have lost that ability and must obtain all their niacin from their diet. Cats must obtain the fatty acid, arachidonic acid from their diets. Animal fats are a good source of arachidonic acid. Unlike most mammals, cats cannot synthesize taurine from cysteine and methionine. They must receive all of it through the muscle meats in their diet. Lack of sufficient taurine causes blindness and heart enlargement. In addition to these special nutrients, cats have a higher protein and fat requirement than dogs and many other mammals.<br>  Although high fiber diets are not natural for cats, some dietary fiber is important for gastrointestinal motility. Dietary fiber also seems to aid in preventing hyperglycemia and diabetes that are common in older cats. Too much fiber can prevent the absorption of vitamins and minerals and lead to diarrhea.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are twelve minerals that are essential for cats. One of these, calcium, is essential for the formation of bone and teeth and as a signal between cells. Kittens that do not receive sufficient calcium have pinkish, translucent teeth a bowlegged stance and knobby painful joints. Partial bone fractures in these kittens are common. Most of the kittens I see with this condition were the offspring of nutritionally deprived feral (wild) cats. Others received a diet that was primarily meat or fish. Meat is low in calcium and high in phosphorus. High phosphorus interferes with the absorption of the little calcium that meat contains. Older cats on low calcium high phosphorus meat diets suffer from tooth and bone problems. <br>  <br>  <br>  Feeding <br>  <br>  <br>  An average sized adult cat weighing nine pounds should consume about 240 kilocalories a day. Neutered cats need less than intact animals. Cats like to munch on and off throughout the day so I suggest dry foods be available at all times. When food is available at all times, cats will eat ten to twenty small meals a day. Younger cats tent to self-regulate their caloric intake and stay lean. But twenty to forty percent of cats become overweight when feed free choice. As cats age, feed them a diet that is less caloric. One needs to consider at cats age and body condition when planning a diet. Problems occur in multi-cat households because it seems that there is always one cat that needs to eat more and another that needs to eat less. The only way I have found to solve this problem is to feed different cats in different closed rooms of the house several times a day. Give them about twenty minutes at a feeding. Thin cats should be encouraged to eat one-and-a-half times a normal ration. This can be done with treats or pungent flavors. Feed chubby cats foods that are advertised as lower caloric or just feed them less. Chubby cats are more susceptible to diabetes and liver disease. If these cats are fed only two thirds of the food they presently consume, weight loss will be gradual and gentle. One can also feed a lower caloric cat chow to accomplish the same thing.<br>  <br>  Food Quality<br>  <br>  Cat foods differ primarily in their source of protein. Generic cat foods use less expensive sources of protein. Because of this, the quality of protein in generic and house brand cat foods is poorer. Do not be led astray by considering only the percent protein. Percent protein tells nothing about the quality and digestibility of the product. Excluding premium, niche and specialty brands sold through pet shops, the quality of cat diets is reflected directly in the price you pay for the food. <br>  Cats love the taste of fish. However, an overactive thyroid gland or hyperthyroidism as well as premature aging have been associated with feeding fish-flavored cat foods. It is not clear if the problem is that poor quality, rancid fish are used in animal foods or if there are constituents in fish themselves that cause the problem. Some nutritionists theorize that the high level of unsaturated fatty acids in fish lend themselves to the formation of free radical groups upon spoiling. If you must feed fish-flavored cat foods, supplement your cat with 25-50 units of vitamin E per day and one milligram of thiamine.

Just make sure you have lots of pics of him and the kids, and tell him how much you love him- just in case these are his final days.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry he is sick and wish you ALL the best!|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	He's pretty old and anything with the heart is never good, especially with an older dog.<br>  <br>  I had a lot of dogs die when I was a kid, most of them had taken off and got hit by a car. It was tough, but it helped me learn about death. It just one of those things that kids need to learn about when they are young, which is why a lot of us had pets growing up as a child.<br>  <br>  So I would wait and see what the x-ray reveals and what the vet says and go from there. Don't worry about anything right now, just enjoy having him around. I hope everything works out for you.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I had a peke live to be 13 with a heart murmur and that was'nt the reason she had to be put to sleep.They will do an ultrasound and give her medication and they can do just fine.So don't worry to much as things have come a long way with our beloved pets and modern medicine.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	There are a lot of medications that can help your dog. The most common ones are : digoxin or lanoxin,enalapryl,furosemide and spironolactone. Most of these are very inexpensive if you get the generic versions.These are to help the heart pump more efficiently and to help with water retention.The vet can also prescribe a cough suppressant to help the dog sleep.Fish oil and CoQ 10 can help a dog with heart problems,and a low-salt diet is good. If I were you,I would get the x-ray tomorrow and get the dog on medication right away. Many dogs can live for a few more years with medication and diet.|`|J9AvKefwaa	Heart murmurs are graded depending on the severity, they are not called massive! Did the vet say what grade the murmur was? It isn't accurate to just call it massive! <br>  <br>  My Bichon Frise has a grade one murmur, when I asked for an explanation about what that meant my vet said it wouldn't cause any problems for her... <br>  <br>  The heart has got four chambers (dogs hearts are same as humans!) if there is a murmur it mean the heart valves between the chambers isn't closing fully, so there is a degree of back flow from the blood. The grading of murmur depends on the severity of the back flow. The vet can hear it when they use a stethoscope. <br>  <br>  You will need to see what your own vet finds and what they say regarding what can or can't be done about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There is a lot of info here - <br>  <a href="http://dogs.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Canine_Heart_Murmur" rel="nofollow">http://dogs.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Canine_H...</a>|`|p7swtBYzaa	You need to discuss this with your vet - heart murmurs come in "grades", the higher the worse it is.<br>  Some dogs have low grade murmurs and it hardly affects their quality of life - obviously your dog has more than a small murmur.<br>  It is caused by an enlarged heart, valve malfunction or defect, one side of the heart chamber larger than the other, some diseases, etc.<br>  All in all, it can often be managed with medicines, as your vet already suggested.<br>  Your vet does need to x-ray your dog to see what his heart looks like - there are more definative tests, but the x-ray is less expensive and does give information.<br>  <br>  I'm very sorry, I hope your dog has some good time left, I have a dog with a low grade heart murmur who does well, but I would not let a dog suffer if there is no hope.<br>  Just see what the x-ray shows and what can be done with meds to give your dog some quality of life and take it from there.   Best of luck to you and yours.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	You need to prepare yourself it sounds as though the end is near.<br>  Don't upset the children until you have had the x-ray done & heard what the vet has to say.  It could just be his time to go.<br>  Tell the children that he is very poorly but wait until you have all the information before treading down that awful path to explain that he has had to go to doggy heaven. Good luck.|`|yZcGMNonaa	A heart murmur is when your heart skips beats or beats irregularly. <br>  And yes I'd prepare them and yourself though they are normally treatable and, for small heart murmurs, well leave on there own. <br>  But I'd rather not get your hopes up since it sounds more serious than a small heart murmur.<br>  <br>  Either way, everything happens for a reason and it'll be hard but you and your family will eventually move on if he doesn't make it.<br>  <br>  It's all gonna be okay so just relax.:)|`|XVCtwLjsaa	Oh my gosh i am so sorry! that makes me really sad, my dogs name is charlie too! dont tell your children yet just do anything you can afford first get the x-ray do anything possible, but im thinking if he is healthy then he should be fine! good luck!|`|KxjUim7yaa	There are treatments. Don't give up hope yet. Stay with your vet and get the x-ray and the medicine. Give Charlie a hug and kiss from all of us. Hope he gets better.|`|Rqb9gPN5aa	These are all questions you need to ask your vet.  People here are NOT vets, nor medical experts.  No one is ever ready to lose their dog.|`|78Xb7enMaa	My Lurcher has a significant heart murmur, it means the valve between the chambers of the heart doesn't close properly and there can be fluid build up around the heart. This can affect breathing and older dogs can become exercise intolerent. The good news is that the medication can be very effective in controlling (but not curing) the condition. I can't tell you how long you might have with your pet but when the time comes he deserves you making the kindest decision to make sure he doesn't suffer. I hope you will at least have a few months to come to terms with losing him if necessary, though of course I hope you have longer.|`|vwC7klVVaa	I had a poodle with a heart mumur who lived for many years with it on daily medication. And had a good quailty of life. The vet needs to take x-rays to check how big the heart is and what the rest of his chest look like . I have attacted i found that my expalin what a heart mumur is. If you have any other questions you should ask your vet they are only to happy to explain things never be embrassed to ask a question how every silly you think it is. I know when you are first told you dog has this problem it is a shock so if you get home from your vet and think i wish i'd ask this ring them up. You don't say how old your children are but it is probably a good idea to talk to them about your dogs illness. My dog lived for many yearss with the condition but i will be honest with you my nanna's yorkie was also diagnoised with a heart mumur and none of the medication work for him and we had to have him put to sleep. Each case is different. <a href="http://www.thensome.com/heartmurmurs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thensome.com/heartmurmurs.htm</a>

They are widely regarded as the most intelligent dog breed in the world. These highly energetic dogs are considered the world's best sheep herding dogs, and are frequently used on farms all over the world for assisting with the handling of livestock. While originally bred for farm work, they have also become popular as pet and sport dogs. These dogs can be protective of a human family member and are, most of the time, affectionate to those they know. They are not a dominant dog and tend to try to avoid fights[citation needed]. Border Collies are easily trained but need a lot of physical exercise and mental stimulation, otherwise they can start bad habits.<br>  <br>  Regular Rough Collies (<a href="http://www.kennels.co.uk/images/P.RoughCollie.jpg):" rel="nofollow">http://www.kennels.co.uk/images/P.RoughC...</a> The Rough Collie is a breed of dog developed originally for herding in Scotland. It is also well known because of the works of author Albert Payson Terhune, and was popularized in later generations by the Lassie novel, movies, and television shows.

iz03uvV4aa	I think REALLY The only downfall is keeping a longer horse together.  They tend to be more difficult to manage and keep together in a package as youve got a little more to work with.  Aside from that, this horse, even though he is long in the back is very proportionate.  I think you should do just fine.  Very cute gelding! :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT**<br>  I have to say that after seeing a few moments of the video, I think when this horse isnt ridden like a western pleasure horse and taught to really move forward a bit more and ride into your hand I think you might be pleasantly suprised at how nice of a horse this is.  He seems to have some pretty cute potential I think! :)<br>  <br>  EDIT**<br>  <br>  Iam sorry this isnt working out for you.  Although Id find out why he is injected, perhaps the injections are nothing serious and are just a minor maintenance?  There are a ton of upper level horses in every dicipline that do require legend injections and so on and its not always a serious thing.  Although I can see your side of things too.  Good Luck Shopping! :)|`|RUxRNsf4aa	Im not sure about dressage, but long backs are actually good for pleasure riding; generally the longer the back, the smoother the gaits. Shorter backs= rougher gaits. Longer backs are better for flat work, as long as your not planning on jumping or anything.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	he'll be fine for low level dressage as well as trails.<br>  things like advanced collecting might become a problem for him, as well as lightening up his forehand, but it won't be horrible.<br>  he defiantly wouldn't be a jumper though.|`|AA10247494	I believe that he would be just fine as a lower level dressage horse or pleasure horse. For his breed he has very nice color and conformation as well. I saw the videos and he looks like his collection would be pretty good for so long coupled an animal. I'd never expect any great height in his action because he is so long but it seems clean and even enough for his level of training.<br>  <br>  I would address the fact that the woman in the video is overworking his sides with your trainer. That can be cleared up a little more training and exercises that focus on softening and a few trust building exercises.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :D|`|CgEjK7NGaa	Yes, long backed horses are OK :)<br>  <br>  For the lower levels, he should be just fine.<br>  The length of the back would only cause problems if you were needing to collect him in a more advanced way.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, he is a pretty mover, and I think he would be suitable.<br>  <br>  Good luck! He is beautiful by the way!! :) :)|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Hmm, she does quite have a long back haha.<br>  <br>  But it's good that her neck balances her out, if it didn't, I would definitely say NO. <br>  <br>  But I think you could pull it off. Just use a few grooming tricks to make the back appear shorter. If he's really good tempered, and has good form, I'd go for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit- I do like the way he moves =) He does well staying with his head collected and has a nice canter. He also seems persistent and calm. Go for it!|`|1tX7KwHsaa	Lovely coat pattern and good flowing gaits. I think it would be a good choice for 1st level dressage. Not much for the rider in the video. I feel like I'm watching a bronc rider spur. I would def. find out if the horse is even sensitive to leg aids anymore.|`|RJXDMFKyaa	They're not very good for barrels or poles.|`|yKGKsWMsaa	giggs is right|`|KdLhlP3Yaa	I noticed other people didn't mention how much kicking the person that is riding him does plus she is wearing spurs!. He might have dead sides and maybe hard to put into an upward transition. For Dressage you want a horse that will obey with the slightest signal and as possible in hand and leg movements.<br>  <br>  He is very long in the back but would do good in lower level dressage and be really nice out on the trails. As mentioned earlier a long back provides a smoother ride. If you are going to purchase this horse your not most likely going to place well when you show in jumping or barrel racing etc. If your only planning on doing dressage/trail than I would say go for it!<br>  Remember always get a vet check! Good luck horse hunting!|`|RloOJ43haa	For lower level dressage, that ought to be fine. Long backed horses have trouble collecting, but collection is not required until about Third Level. At Second Level, they want to see the start of an uphill balance. Additionally, the long back only makes collection harder, but not impossible.|`|hEXb1unraa	Im sorry but that is a horrid rider....I think that horse would perform a lot better with a more competent rider.....she is balancing off her hands and posting off her lower leg.......horrid!!!   I think this horse is alright...just remember a pre purchase exam.

Shorter tanks won't be suitable for a mature Angel (they can get up to 12" tall from fin tip to fin tip).<br>  <br>  As for Balas - these are big fish, getting around 12" long, and need a 6ft tank minimum for a shoal.

Trust me on this  a adult breeding pair will get rid of the rest if you don't .|`|IKzeeod2aa	Not too many. From what I know they are somewhat aggressive, and may attack each other. You might want to opt for gold fish instead.|`|0WyFs0q0aa	screw the angel fish get some african cichlids they fight|`|KAjFbpyAaa	You could keep three of the same sex in there as adults.If two angels pair up they will beat up the other one. You could keep 6 in there until they pair up than you would have to rehome the other fish. Bala sharks  get way to big for a 3o and will stress the angels out anyways.
w1lh1INHaa	There are varying opinions in the veterinary community as to whether low protein food is effective in the management of feline CRF. Some experts believe that any benefit from eating low protein food may be from the lower content of phosphorous contained in the food rather than the low protein itself. Furthermore, some believe that a low protein diet contributes to weakness and muscle wasting, two very common symptoms in CRF cats.<br>  <br>  Because protein metabolism residue (that the kidneys must filter) is what you are trying to eliminate, high quality protein that produces little waste may be preferable to simply reducing overall protein.  Generally, the low-protein diet is to restrict phosphorus.   For more information and both pros and cons regarding this subject, click on the links below: <br>  <br>  In my experience with Kidney issues, a more natural, raw diet is the most beneficial.  I have a cat that had a diseased kidney removed six years ago and has lived with 25% function very nicely since, and he eats an easily digestible, low grain high-protein 50% raw diet.  Making my own cat food actually saves me a lot of money, and I know exactly what is going into it.<br>  <br>  Whether you choose to go with a high-protein or limited protein diet depends on your cat and where he is at with the disease.  I urge you to do a search on "kidney disease [or CRF] cats diet" and look at the wealth of information -- and recipes -- available to help maintain your cat's health and longevity.<br>  <br>  And, don't even try to get your cat on dry food, as this will only stress kidney function.  Dry food is the culprit for so many organ issues to begin with, and the last thing you need is the kidney stress and dehydrating effect dry food has.<br>  <br>  You also want to be sure of the ingredients in the food.  Many "low protein" diets have little actual meat, but rather get their foods to be low-protein with non-meat protein sources such as beans, soy (which can stress a CRF cat), and other vegetation.  These are not protein sources that are easily digested or processed by a cat.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.felineinstincts.com/articles/Felineinstinctsrenalfailureinformation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.felineinstincts.com/articles/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=003" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a>|`|LxBwmRTlaa	Your Veterinarian should have given you a list of different brands with low protein food for your cat. I would suggest you feed your cat Hills k/d (canned) or Walthams low protein (canned) you can purchase any of those two food products at any veterinary office. At some specialty pet stores you can buy  Hi-Tor low protein (canned)  Also, when cat's have kidney problems you dont need to feed less protein. Most commercial cat food products are'nt even high enough in protein. You can check here: <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=003" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a><br>  some studies have suggested that excessive restriction of protein may actually cause further damage to the kidneys and other organs, because there is not enough protein for normal body maintenance and repair.

7Nzvjkbsaa	I'm so sorry you are going through this--it must be quite painful and confusing for you.  However, since your father is now sending pictures of you and your sister to someone you don't know I would say it is time to get an adult involved to help you.  If you don't feel comfortable with approaching your mom, how about a trusted teacher or guidance counselor at your school?  Or perhaps even your doctor?  Someone who is objective, who can help you through this situation and give good advice.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and hang in there.  I'm sure you will be able to get through this and it sounds like you are a terrific big sister since you are looking out for her well-being in addition to your own.  If you would like to message me for any reason, please feel free to do so.  Sometimes it helps to just be able to 'vent' to someone else.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Tell your mother & let her handle it.

I know that's hard to understand, and I am sure that you feel very much betrayed by your dad, but please stay calm - don't do anything until you have discussed it with someone older that you can rely on and trust.<br>  <br>  It will be over one day and life goes on, it may seem like the end of the world for you and your family, but it will work its way out, believe me, just don't do anything rash until you get some adult help.

AA11307993	She might be molting:<br>  "Most tarantulas will molt on their back or on their sides. When molting, a tarantula should be left alone. If you find your spider on it's back, IT'S NOT DEAD! Dying tarantulas usually curl their legs up underneath them. When you find your tarantula beginning to molt sit back and watch for a while, it's a fascinating thing to observe but it can take a few hours so be patient. You should see the legs pulsating as the spider attemps to slip out of its old skin."|`|gGYsRXgHaa	Can she get up by herself? If she can let her be.

TTLIp8Beaa	*obviously, these are both training aids, and are not permanent fixes to any problems your horse may have.<br>  <br>  <br>  standing martingale<br>  <br>  pros:<br>  -stops the horse from raising his head above a specific point <br>  -good for horses that toss their heads over low jumps<br>  -can only be used on a cavesson<br>  <br>  cons:<br>  -illegal in most flat classes <br>  -more restrictive (can not be easily loosed in an emergency) <br>  -can only be used over low fences (2'6 and under)<br>  -if the horse trips he is more likely to fall because his motion is restricted <br>  -can not be used with a flash, drop nose band, or figure 8<br>  -can not be used with specific bits (like a gag)<br>  -can cause lameness, spine, and muscle problems if fitted improperly<br>  <br>  running martingale:<br>  <br>  pros:<br>  -uses leverage to encourage the horse to lower it's head<br>  -provides more head freedom then a standing martingale<br>  -if the horse trips, the rider can give with their hands and free the horse's head so he has more of a chance of regaining his footing<br>  -only type of martingale used in eventing (only one that is legal and permitted) <br>  -allows more freedom over larger fences ( 2'6+)<br>  <br>  cons:<br>  -must be used with rein stops.

At least in my book. They really are just a band-aid on lack of training. They  just restrain the horse from lifting its head via nose band, physically forcing it to hold its head down as apposed to fixing this problem with training. It could be your worst decision to start using one because you may find that it is extremely difficult to wean your horse off of this "crutch" because they learn to lean on it. If too short it can also be dangerous for jumping because the horse needs the release in its head for balance.<br>  <br>  Running martingale:<br>  A much better training aid, helps teach the horse to tuck his head in and give to the bit, and if you decide to take it off, no big deal. Some jumpers also use it on a loose setting where it isn't really in effect, but used so that if they fall off then it helps keep the reins from coming over with them, so it doesn't get tangled in the horses legs. Be sure to use the martingale stoppers though so it doesn't get stuck on the bit or down around the horses legs if he puts his head down.|`|yKGKsWMsaa	i agree w/ Stephanie

YtBzRAxMaa	It is hard and there will be times over the next 2 or 3 YEARS that you will wonder what the heck you got your self into!<br>   What works for me is to give him a reason to WANT to trust you.<br>   I do not "trap" them in a round pen - too many horses are abused IN a round pen.<br>   I do not sit around in a chair with a book - unless I am sitting IN his only pile of hay and have time to wait. I have done everything from Xmas cards to grocery lists as he eats near me.<br>   I offer grain feedings in a bucket that 1) I am crouching near and not looking at him (2) I am then holding with outstreatched arms and (3) I am holding normally. Horses learn to know what a bucket contains in a very short period of time. If you never offer him grains other than with you holding the bucket (standing STILL) - he will slowly , may even tremble , may snatch a bite and then retreat - but he WILL eat from the bucket in a few days. Then he will slowly start to call to you when he sees you coming with the bucket - in time he will meet you at the gate. If you are clever you will call out the same words EVERY time you come - this will help him to identify the words and you with good things and eventually he will come when you call.<br>    You will be able to touch his head - eventually moving to his neck and so on. Touch his halter - tug gently on it - if he freaks out - do nothing, wait for him to return (and he will) and start again.<br>   By associating yourself with his food he will have a reason to want to trust you. The rest is slow and steady from there.<br>   GOOD LUCK|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Check out some natural horsemenship videos at the library.  You should also look into John Lyons videos on round pen reasoning.  That is a really good way to establish your relationship with him without having alot of physical contact for starters.  Especially if you cannot get near him this works great.  Do you have a round pen?  Start with his mind first then physical contact.<br>  <br>  There is alot you can do more than we can say on here, videos are great and free at the library.<br>  <br>  You will just have to dedicate lots of time to him, and with patience he will begin to trust again.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|pvgwJwxvaa	clicker training can work wonders with a horse with trust issues.|`|KdR1Lx3yaa	IT TAKES TIME AND A LOT OF TLC  START BY TALKIN TO HIM AND GIVN TREATS|`|BREi7qw7aa	if hes pastured, you could try just standing outside in the pasture with him.

In order for him to trust you, he will have to believe you are worth trusting.  Giving him treats and reading books in his corral are nice things, but they don't help him gain trust in you as a confident leader he believes he will be safe around.  In order for him to ever get to the point where he trusts you, you must establish yourself as a figure of leadership and consistency, this in turn will help him feel that he is safe.  He is afraid of whips because of how they have been used, but they can also be used as useful guidance tools in the round pen.  Patience and consistency will be the key with him.  <br>  If you don't show yourself worthy of being his leader, he will never believe you are.  The relationship you will develop after the level of respect has been reached will be far stronger than any relationship you would have had without that level of accepted leadership.<br>        Beware, often when people received abused horses they try and "make up" for the damage that has been done by being overly indulgent and avoiding discipline. this is the last thing the horse needs, because it does not help them feel as though they are with a rider/handler who will be brave in the face of opposition or (what they perceive as) danger.<br>  What these poor animals need is strength in character, consistency, care, and patience, this will emotionally help them be able to heal and walk tall again believing in their handler/rider. good luck!|`|AA10776535	I would just sit out there with him, let him see your not there to hurt him.

AA10859773	Please pardon my "fluffy bunny"-ness.  I'm in love with the Dog Whisperer show and I'm trying to find ways to translate his teachings to cats.<br>  <br>  If you know that company is coming, you can try using Rescue Remedy on her beforehand.  It's worth a shot.<br>  <br>  I think that what will ultimately calm her is simply getting used to it.  But you can also ask your guests not to make a big deal out of her - no touch, no talk, no eye contact.  You may have heard that cats tend to go to people who don't like them, and there are those who say that the secret behind this is the fact that those people aren't staring at the cat, which they actually find to be rather rude.  So if your guests are asked to ignore her she may eventually find company less stressful.<br>  <br>  I don't know that I would force her to be in a room with a lot of people - let her go hide if she wants to.  But don't give her any special treats or treatment afterwards.  In effect, you'd be telling her that hiding was a good thing.  Just ignore her.<br>  <br>  You can try to lure her out with treats but if she doesn't come, don't make a big deal of it.<br>  <br>  Sorry I don't have a better answer!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	She'll just have to get used to them.  Try having a couple (not many at first) of friends over while she's in the room.  At first don't have your friends acknowledge her. A few visits later, have your friends talk to her and offer her treats or play with her with a feather toy.  It will take time and patience but as she sees no one is going to harm her, she'll become more confident and friendlier.|`|4EvHy9Ipaa	Some cats are just not people friendly. I have one. As soon as she hears a knock on the door or a strange voice, she runs and hides. She will eventually come out and sniff around but no one can touch her. My daughters have tried all recommendations but nothing works with her and she is now 18 months old. She is very loving, cuddly and purry with me so I don't care that she is not people friendly.|`|0eLy8Yzfaa	Get her new interesting toys. Play with her and get her little treats and give them to her buy hand. Don't rush her. Start of just with you then when she gets more comfortable introduce more and more people. Play with her more make it more fun. Its probably just a phase she'll get over it. Start as if she's a kitten again. Start of small then slowly increase her socialization. Be patient i'm sure you're a very good owner don't worry!|`|FQyeGsIyaa	When your cat growls and hisses and pushes away, she's telling you she's scared.  This is something you can't force on a cat, it has to come to accept people at its own pace.  A friend had a cat named Yoda that for all the years I visited I never saw the cat.  <br>  <br>  My cat is very skittish; she runs and hides when company comes.   I've told everyone to ignore her.  She'll sneak into the living room behind the couch or sit on the stairs and watch.  She's also gone under the dining room table while we ate and rubbed against a few legs.  A friend who has a cat and visits more frequently let his hand dangling off the edge of the sofa,  My cat came over and sniffed and rubbed against his hand while he pretended not to notice.  A couple of times when family visited, I spent a little time in the living room with the cat while the family was in the dining room.  My cat is really attached to me so she got some attention and comforting that all was ok even with people in the other room.  I'd leave her and go back to join the party.<br>  <br>  Once a visitor pays attention to her, she's off and running again.  It takes less time now for her to come back and watch and she spends more time in the same room with company than she did before, so this is real progress.

They can grow up to 8 feet and need a 40 gallon breeder tank or bigger. The only thing you really have to watch with them is the humidity. The humidity in the tank should be between 70% and 80%.

Hope this helps.|`|CexnhuDUaa	Leopard geckos are very easy to care for, and they are beautiful reptiles, as well. They grown to be about 7.5-9 inches. You can purchase them for around $30(in California, at least), or possibly less online. One can be put in a 10 gallon tank, and all you need for them is a heater, two hides, a moist hide(for shedding), and possibly a few decorations. You can use newspaper, or reptile carpet for bedding, so they're not to high-maitenence.<br>  <br>  Here are some good Leopard geckos care sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.leopardgeckocare.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.leopardgeckocare.net/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.leopardgecko.com/emcare.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.leopardgecko.com/emcare.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.progeckos.com/caresheets/leos.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.progeckos.com/caresheets/leos...</a>|`|sWUEAUAlaa	Geckos are very easy to take care of.

You can buy them at all pet stores, they are cheap and fairly reliable.  <br>  <br>  When: You should test pH (along with nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, phosphate, etc) weekly unless there is an issue, then you should check it more often.  <br>  <br>  Why: To ensure the pH of your water is comparable to ocean water where your tank inhabitants would naturally be.  If the pH is out of whack, thing will die and your whole tank will be hosed.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	You can get a test kit for pH. I recommend them for new tanks.

6beL9zycaa	Hey, PK...  Good to see you!<br>  Let's see.  Out of the 15 or so cats we've had over a lifetime, I have had a couple who used their paws quite a bit more than the others when they ate or drank.  But what you're describing I've only seen a few times with other people's cats.  So my answer would have to be a "guess" but I'm guessing maybe... 5 to10%  of cats use their paws to scoop up their food?  Again, it's just a guesstimate based on my own cats, friend's cats, & the cats I've known as a vet tech.  I know it isn't common, but it's also not... uncommon, lol!  Does that make any sense at all?  Anyway, it's a lot of fun to watch, isn't it?!  Hope all is well with you...|`|Rw7gi86Naa	I have read several times before that Maine Coons have been known for this. <br>  <br>  "The term 'coon cat' was coined because the brown tabby Maine Coon's black and brown stripes and thick, striped tail resemble a raccoon's. The resemblance is enhanced by the Maine Coon's dexterity with its paws: most Maine Coons occasionally use their paws to drink water and eat dry food"<br>  <br>  My cats have never done it, but I've seen it on video:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVe431wKUkE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVe431wKU...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQUieeBmTlY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQUieeBmT...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VWBVbxHMEc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VWBVbxHM...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gtLw9DgzHQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gtLw9Dgz...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9MGcWOI1gE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9MGcWOI1...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc8rIh1WWEY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc8rIh1WW...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVKALKRwVv8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVKALKRwV...</a><br>  <br>  I also noticed that in almost all of the videos I found the cats have plastic bowls! <br>  <br>  Stainless steel or glass food/water bowls are the best choices. Cats have an excellent sense of smell, and since their noses are so close to their mouths, they work hand in hand. Often cat's don't like plastic because it makes their food/water smell like plastic, (and they‘re also harder to keep clean, and bacteria will remain in the bowl). Also, if the bowl is too deep/narrow the cat may refuse to use it because their whiskers are very sensitive and they don't like them touching the side of the bowl. <br>  "Twisted Whiskers" by Pam Johnson|`|UNFxjNHkaa	hahah!!!

AA10229248	Usually the dogs that drool have the short, square muzzles. Look for dogs that have longer muzzles like Irish Wolfhounds, Scottish Deerhounds, Borzoi, etc. Stay away from the molosser breeds like the Mastiff and Dogue de Bordeaux if you want to avoid drool.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Do you mean Mastiff breeds or just large breeds altogether?<br>  <br>  I would probably say the Cane Corso Mastiff. They obviously drool a little bit depending on how well they are bred (well-bred ones shouldn't drool). They weigh usually 80-110lbs and are up to 27 inches high at their base. <br>  <br>  Or the "Canary Dog" also known as Presa Canario. They are 80-130lbs and can get up to 25 inches. Non-drooling and big!<br>  <br>  So I would say one of those two. But then again there are German Shepherd Dogs, Labrador Retrievers, etc. But if you mean like large as in heavy, stocky, and tall, then definitely the Presa Canario or the Cane Corso Mastiff.|`|Chib4b8saa	I have a doberman who is 80 lbs. and he doesn't drool, or bark, or chew or anything else that other dogs seem to do.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	all dogs drool at some level....it's just a matter of how much you're willing to tolerate.|`|OAWCNff5aa	Labs|`|30f81928829901a2ffd80fea7ad7d8b5aa	A Leonberger?

P4mHOvpXaa	Yes if they are used to the warm by ur radiator then move them into a pond in one of the warm seasons or they could die from sudden tempreture change while u are travaling to the pond!<br>  its deffinatly a good idea to move them into a pond<br>  they can make more fishy friends lol :)|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I would recommend waiting until the summer to release them in a pond. Also, make sure the pond is deeper than 2ft, otherwise, it's likely to freeze and kill the fish.|`|J1Gfjcvuaa	You live in engaland?? DALMIT i freking love england, (LUCKY) nupolian dinamite voice
bDPVRtCNaa	As long as they are acclimated to the ponds temperature correctly, it should not be a problem. They are coldwater fish.<br>  <br>  Acclimating- I would go to a local fish shop and ask for a large plastic bag. I have had customers ask for them. Fill the bag with water from your aquarium and your fish. Take them to the pond and float the bag on top of the water for about 15 minutes. After this open the bag and introduce a small amount of the pond water into the bag. (many people forget that the fish must become accustomed to pH as well as temperature) After about 20 more minutes remove the fish from the bag and put them in the pond.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	I would gradually move the tank from the radiator. Doing this slowly will let them get used to the change in temperature.<br>  In the weeks upto the move, add some of the pond water to the tank when you do your water change, that way the fish will get used to the change in water.|`|EK4hQgD6aa	Like elizabeth K says. Actually, exactly. Well done elizabeth K!!!
qgAa87mSaa	Fish don't really just die, there is most likely an underlying cause.  The angels may have had a disease or been old, but most likely it was the water conditions.  Test your water and see what the ph, hardness and temp are, if you can't take it to the pet shop and have them test it for you.  A portion of tank water should also be changed frequently to keep the nitrate (water pollution) down.  Make sure the water you use doesn't have chlorine or chloramine (if it does, you can use a product like Amquel to neutralize it before adding water to tank).  Once you know your water conditions, ask the pet store what fish are best suited for a beginner in that water, typically zebra danios are a safe bet.  Keep up with maintenance and the tank should thrive. Good luck|`|crw44vnRaa	Guppy's, Molly's and most large tetra are good community tankers that seem to be pretty hearty.|`|BMri9tITaa	My harlequin rasboras don't die.  Ever.

UNFxjNHkaa	did you ever get that other problem she had checked out first?  When you said she had puss coming out from her vagina?  <br>  You should see about getting that fixed before you spay her - or you might be looking at a great deal of problems...<br>  <br>  Take pretty kitty's advice and go to your local SPCA<br>  <br>  I just called 2 vets offices in Baltimore - they both told me the same thing.  The cat needs to be seen IMMEDIATELY.  A healthy kitty that needs to be spayed costs around $275 at a regular vet.  It is going to be more expensive now that she may have this infection.<br>  <br>  You need to take her to an SPCA immediately.  This is an emergency.<br>  <br>  I am on the phone with your SPCA (Maryland) - they said that you'll only qualify to get her spayed/looked at if you are a low income earner - if you you live in a single income household then you need to make 18k a year or less to qualify.  If you are a multi-income household, you'll need to be making 35k or less per year.<br>  <br>  GET HER THERE NOW!  They will take care of her for this emergency|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	call shelters in your area, most do low cost spays....tomorrow is spay day most shelters will be giving more discounts on spay/neuters|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Try petfinder for listings on vets. contact shelters for organizations that spay on a fixed or sliding income.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	It sounds like you may be dealing with Pyometra judging from Amanda's answer.  The typical treatment for Pyometra is an emergency spay. Every minute you spend looking for a bargain vet wastes precious time your cat may not have.  Once her uterus erupts, she'll be poisoned.  Get to any vet you can find and worry about the cost later.<br>  <br>  An SPCA or Humane Society clinic is probably the cheapest you'll find.  Explain your situation so they know she has to come now.<br>  <br>  You are in a "do or die" situation here and you don't have much time.  If you can't have your cat treated immediately, she needs to be turned in to a shelter where she can get help.  If she does have Pyometra (very likely), here is what's going on with her uterus<br>  <a href="http://www.congocoon.com/Links.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.congocoon.com/Links.html</a><br>  Scroll down and look at the pictures.<br>  She MUST get medical attention immediately.<br>  <br>  I'm sure if your uterus was engorged with pus and about to explode spilling poison into your system that would kill you, you would not be wasting time looking for a bargain treatment. Your cat is in this condition because you failed to provide her with preventative care (timely spay).  You owe it to her to try and save her life. She is in pain and her life is at risk.  She can't drive herself to the vet.  She's depending on you.  If she has Pyometra, I assure you, she will die if she doesn't get to a vet quickly.  It will be a horrible, painful death and you will be left with nothing but a corpse and about a pint or more of pus spilled out of her to clean up.
zqVDJxUIaa	Tiger barbs are quite fin-nippy, I would definitely not put them in with neons. For that matter, the behavior of Serpaes vary greatly. I have a bunch of Serpaes in a community aquarium, along with black phantoms, corys, platys etc. I occasionally see some fin-nipping, but not a lot. For the most part, they are peaceful fish, though I would never put them in with neons, since neons are a bit fragile compared to most aquarium fish.<br>  Serpaes and the Tiger barbs might work however, and I'd recommend those two, if you had to pick a pair. Introduce the Serpaes at least a day before the Tigers, to let them get a feel for the tank. Wait a day or two, then purchase the Barbs. The Barbs, unfamiliar to the new tank, will not harass the Serpaes. After you get them, I'd recommend you monitor the two carefully to determine whether any problems arrive. For more info on Serpaes, Tigers, and Neons, Ive added some links:)<br>  <br>  Serpae Tetra:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/tetrafish/serpaetetra.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/tetrafis...</a><br>  Tiger Barb:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/barbs/tigerbarb.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/barbs/ti...</a><br>  Neon Tetra:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/tetrafish/neontetra.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/tetrafis...</a><br>  <br>  All three (not together) make a nice addition to any aquarium, and I've had the pleasure of seeing them breed (except for the neons)<br>  They all need a well planted aquarium, and a temperature in the 70's.<br>  <br>  Good luck with you aquarium!|`|jazR1sk1aa	Really depends on the size of your tank.  <br>  <br>  A larger tank this should go just fine, providing you get a group of barbs.  <br>  5-6+ should be fine so they don't pick on anyone else. <br>  <br>  Similar groups of serpae tetras and neons would be excellent as well.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Fish are like people...they should act one way but eventually act another!

Tiger barbs need to be in no less that 8 fish per shoal to keep the play contained, this way they'd have little effect if any on any other fish, given that the other two are shoaling fish and should be kept in similar numbers to satisfy there needs. so you're talking 20+ plus fish and should be stocked in groups with Tigers last, both serpae and neons could be added in half the shoal at the same time, you really require a surface area for this many fish of no less than 576sq inch. <br>  I terms of size that's 48x12inch or variation thereof.
kvHqnR5Haa	First of all, ignore the comments people will be making about your breed.  They apparently have nothing better to do than insult people.  But as for advice, I would suggest crate training your puppy if you haven't already.  It works wonders for potty training!  Just make sure the crate isn't too big, otherwise you risk the puppy soiling in it.  And don't use it for punishment, you want it to be a happy place that she feels comfortable in.  Keep toys, a soft blanket, etc in there.  Good luck!|`|QOWPdl2qaa	Watch out for teething, my dog (she's a sheltie) chewed up our kitchen table.

Watch the dog whisper on the history channel.|`|A9NBtUy6aa	Clicker training is really good, it gives the dog an exact moment when she knows she is doing the right thing- far easier for her to understand what you are trying to teach her.<br>  <br>  If you aren't too against it, choke chains really do work. Resist getting one of those leads that extend- it teaches the dog that if it pulls at the lead it can walk further away, and she'll never learn to heel and not pull- my dog heels perfectly with no lead, and i feel safe to walk her along roads like that because we taught her to walk at heel when told and to sit at the side if a car comes, even if we arent around.<br>  <br>  Crate training is really useful if you are worried about her with other pets or with the house, and it teaches excellent house training.<br>  <br>  Never skip on walks or food- my cat has a urinary tract infection because we fed her cheap french cat food and now she pees blood all over my room cos she can't help herself. Give her the best you can afford, because you'll probably pay later if you don't.<br>  <br>  Try to avoid teaching her to bark- it gets embarassing, especially when small children visit the house, or people who are scared.<br>  <br>  Try to avoid teaching her to beg- if you want to feed her some of your table food (only a little, just to taste) make sure it is ok for her to eat (internet or books) and mix it up into her feed bowl with her normal feed when she is finished, or drop a bit on the floor discretely and let her fin dit herself- it means you won't be embarassed when she is at a dinner party and begging.<br>  <br>  Don't teach her to jump up unless given a direct order- if she jumps up at little kids, she could give them a real fright!<br>  <br>  The thing about not taking her out is not necessarily true- you just have to find a quiter place and keep her close- we carried my puppy the first time we took her out, and comforted her when she got scared by horses!<br>  <br>  Can't think of any more off the top of my head, but hope this is useful :)|`|46BXDvopaa	I have a beagle shes pretty old and near death but still I can remember when she was a few years old because me and her are around the same age. Anyways I'm guessing your new puppy has already made a accident on your floor because your puppy is still not used to going on newspaper or outside. So I suggest when your dog has a accident you pick the puppy up take her over and rub her nose in it a little or spray her with a little toy water squirt gun and not one of those things that had chemicals in it from a store because if you got it in your puppy's eyes it could hurt if there's still chemicals in it. Or if your puppy makes a mess in to everything I still suggest the toy squirt gun. If that doesn't work tie your puppy up outside for a little while and bring the puppy back in. I suggest you get one of those dog runners because you should NEVER take you puppy out on a run or walk until its 1 year old. I hope I helped!|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	Start obedience classes sooner rather then later. The earlier you start the better off you'll be in the long run. Also be mindful of when your dog starts teething because it will lead o things being gnawed on that you didn't know could be gnawed on - in our case it was corners of base boards and friends of ours would come home to holes chewed in their corners (meaning the drywall chewed through). The old adage about never ever giving puppies people food is also true. I always thought it was nonsense until I did it and now 2 years later my dog will still beg for whatever I'm eating while I know people who never gave their dog people food and now said dog won't touch it. <br>  <br>  Also make sure your dog gets enough exercise and play time as well as love. A bored dog with too much energy is never a good thing<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eMCCQD8Faa	Well when I got my dachsund we took him out like every 20-30 minutes until he knew he had to pee outside now goes out to pee in the morning and at night.....never in the house. They get used to how u teach them..just like a baby
IrdZKYT3aa	Well, you'll be fine with him small, but yes, he will become a danger as he gets larger.  Not only that, but it will outgrow your tank as well.  They can reach 8 inches in length,and become aggressive long before they reach full size.<br>  If you're able to, I'd consider returning him instead.  Many stores will have a couple weeks for the return/exchange policy.<br>  I'd look into otto cats instead.  They stay about 1-1.5 inches, but need to be in groups of three or more.<br>  Or just leaving the scrubbing to yourself.  They have magnetic scrubbers now that can make it very quick and easy to clean the glass.  In a ten gallon,which won't hold many fish, it would also help to free up what little fish space you have.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|F8m1VaoYaa	i get thumbs down for this but i have a cae in a 12 gallon tank and its fine with my fish,but i would not put 2 together un less it was a large tank .|`|UHb5GFIIaa	I had these chinese algae eaters and i found them to pester the other fish, and they were a bit aggressive, i returned them and sot a little hill stream loach, also known as a hong kong plec, butterfly plec, but they are actually a loach, they grow to around 1.5- 2 inch's, and are peaceful shy little fish, i have them, and they are lovely to watch, and very good at cleaning the algae, but bare in mind you will still have to do some algae cleaning yourself as part of maintaining you tank.

fYupEegGaa	I would only use plant made for aquariums because plants you get from the craft department probably are not aquarium safe and you don't know what they are made with so they could have something in the plant that is toxic to fish.

a29qiNkvaa	They recommend that you store your food in the original bag! You can place the food in a storage container but keep it in the bag!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  What is the best way to store Solid Gold pet food once it is opened?<br>  We generally recommend placing the entire bag into an airthight container, without pouring it out. The container should be stored in a cool dry place. Pouring the food out exposes it to a rush of air and can increase the rate at which it will oxidize, decreasing the shelf-life. By leaving the food in the bag and then placing the bag into an airtight container, he bag becomes a barrier which then provides an extra layer of protection. Also this allows tracking of any issues or problems which may arise as the bag is being used because there is a batch number and expiration date which identifies that particular production run. The canned foods should be covered and stored in the refrigerator for no longer than 3-5 days.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	I bought a plastic container on wheels from PetSmart that will hold a 30lb bag of food.

2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	This is the bad part about all of this, cats can get lost 10 feet from your house, if they were not marking their way with their paws, tail and face.. If the cat was startled. She could have ran and now is lost.  The worst part of this , if she is not spayed you had no business letting her out.. More then likely if she isn't hurt , she will be pregnant. You may never find her other then calling for her and looking around the neighborhood. Try at least a 3 block radius around the area.|`|NPr6dVYZaa	Here is a website with tips for finding your lost kitty. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lostapet.org/recovery-lostcat.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.lostapet.org/recovery-lostcat...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps and your kitty is found.
l8gUwy2daa	This is going to be a long answer, but it is a step-by-step directly from my pet rat guide by Colin Patterson. It sounds like you are doing it right, but here you go just in case. Good luck!!!<br>  Basic litter training: Step-by-step<br>  Potty training for rats means litter training, and the sooner you begin, the better your rats will be at it, although older rats have been known to catch on quickly as well. By the way, baby rats will usually learn litter training from a doe that already is trained, so once you get into breeding you never really need to worry about potty training again. The key is going to come down to sounding a stimulus and giving a reward to reinforce good behavior. More on that in a minute, but first it's important to understand a rat's instincts. A rat will instinctively leave solid waste in a corner of their enclosed dwelling, making it easy to transition them to using a litter tray. Urine, however, is an entirely different story. Many rats, especially males, will pee all over the place in little droplets. It’s a way of marking their territory and even a sign of affection. They pee on the things they like – their food, each other, and you! You can always keep an old towel or rag around to wipe up any “token of love” they leave around. The idea of litter training is, at the very least, to get your ratties to leave all their solid waste in one spot that is set apart from the rest of their dwelling. Not only does keeping everything cleaner mean much less work for you, but it<br>  also makes the place less germy, keeping your precious pet pair as healthy as possible.<br>  1. On cage clean-up day, notice where most of your rats’ solid waste was deposited. With gloves on, pick up their solid droppings and put them aside.<br>  2. Prepare a corner ferret litter tray with a plastic lining and then fill to<br>  about an inch to two inches from the bottom with some ferret or kitty litter. Add the droppings.<br>  3. After cleaning the cage completely, place the prepared litter tray inside the same corner of the cage where your rats tend to leave droppings.<br>  4. When your rat gets the idea and begins to use the litter tray, sound the stimulus and reward them profusely. Be sure to praise them with hugs and kisses, too.<br>  5. If you see your pet rat “missing the target” you can try to move him, or at the very least, move the dropping into the tray immediately.<br>  6. Take the time, at least once each day, to move fresh droppings into the litter tray. Eventually your quick-witted friends will notice how much<br>  cleaner and fresher the air stays when they poop in the right place.<br>  It is also a very good idea to allow your pet rats access to a litter tray during their playtime. This would mean either keeping the entire cage accessible to them with the door open, or placing the tray in one corner of their play space. With encouragement and rewards for good behavior, your pair of pals will be potty-trained in no time at all.|`|6HhO1Evfaa	Okay get a tissue box and cut out the face where you pull tissues out of.  <br>  Actually get two <br>  Do that to both <br>  Put them close to each other<br>  Cut out the faces that are facing the space between them<br>  Tape them together<br>  Have them always go potty by a certain thing (can be anything but fabric) out of the cage<br>  Get them to always go potty by that thing even when you don't direct them to<br>  Put the tissue boxes in the cage<br>  Put the thing they go potty by in the cage<br>  Direct them to go to the tissue boxes when going potty if they don't do it already<br>  <br>  It will take time!

ZH4N6Xdtaa	make sure your chin has plenty of dust baths for the next couple of days, if it doesn't dry get someone to hold your chin and then you need to stand about a metre away and blast the chin with cold air from your hairdryer for a couple of seconds at time to try and get rid of the excess moisture but this is a last resort measure as this is very stressful for your chin..<br>  This is a serious answer, this is something breeders do when the chins get wet and I have done this before because one of my chins managed to get in the kitchen sink!!
