20080227153131AA86YcS	Beauty & Style;Hair	HELP! My hair has gone slightly green and I want to get it blonde again!?	My hair is blonde and about a week and half ago I dyed it with a nice and easy light blonde and it came out extremely white blonde but with yellow patches in areas. So yesterday I went to the hairdressers and had caramel and beige put through it hoping it would look more natual but now it looks a muddy brown with an awful green tinge to it!!! I desperately want my blonde hair back now asap. If I put an ash blonde on again tomorrow will it go greener or any other strange colour? I do realise it will damage my hair and dry it out but this isn't a problem if i can get the blonde back. I don't want to wait as I can't stand this dull browny green colour a second longer and want my light blonde back ASAP.... pls pls help!!! Many thanks.

But it's something about fashion and ones style.       I love Art I think it's the libra in me, anyway getting back to the subject at hand. I have some great idea for clothes but Im so scared of the sewing machine.       I use to love shopping( I stil do) but now Im wise enough to know I dont need everything in the windows( I picture myself dressing someone else when Im looking at the window now, like it's one of me but millions of ppl I can dress them). plus I have one body and ppl have many diffrent bodies and shapes I would have fun dolling them up. I love that and also doing hair, even though I never did hair but just gave ppl relaxers.

I need to know of any products that work to straighten and control frizz without the greasy feeling, and maybe even heat-activated or help improve the feel of your hair.

20090226115507AAt7nFB	Beauty & Style;Hair	Good suggestions to defrizz and flatten thick hair?	I have very curly-wavy thick hair. It gets very frizzy, no matter what I do. And the only solution is to put in:      Garnier Fructis- Sleek & Shine Anti-Frizz Serum after my hair gets dry, then I put it in a ponytail while it dries.       Now, it does work a little bit by smoothing it out and getting rid of some of the frizz, but it is still highly annoying. The ponytail flattens my hair a little bit, but only for a short period of time.      Suggestions? I need advice from people who know what they are talking about. I don't need a million products, please.      Oh, and it doesn't necessarily matter if I blow-dry it or let it dry on its own. And I want to keep my waves/curles.      Pretty much, my hair would be PERFECT for the 80's. But it is the 21 century and I want it less big and annoying.      Thank you :)

20090225105854AAsrXB7	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Is it POSSIBLE to be successful as a self-taught tattoo artist?	I need a new career, and being a tattoo artist would be my dream job.  The problem is I have been told over and over and OVER that nope, no way, nuh-uh, you can NOT be a successful tattoo artist without spending 3 years mopping somebody's floor first.  No, I do not want to be a "scratcher" who learns by making mistakes on people, and I totally see the value of learning the art from a master.  But there are no artists within 100 miles that I would really want to learn from.  I already know about infection control and blood-borne pathogens.  I have artistic ability.  I have the desire.  What I don't have is the practical hands-on skill of applying ink to skin.  I also don't know about the equipment itself or the logistics of running a successful shop.  Is there some way to hybridize this learning process?  Learn what I can from books/courses, and thus shorten my apprenticeship?   I AM serious about this; it's just that my family's needs must come first.

20090226124301AArb3T8	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Why does this always happen?  It's so ******* annoying!!!?	I have this really cute pair of hollister laguna skinny jeans. They are dark wash and I usually pair them up with some chestnut uggs which I tuck the jeans into. Anyway, I wanted to know something about the sizing. When I pull them on, it takes me at least five to ten minutes to get them and the crotch all the way up. They're skintight, at least, but then they feel like there sliding down as the day goes on. I mean, I love how tight and sleek they look on my legs, but I have a hard time wearing them to school cause I always have to pull them up. It just seems like every ten minutes, I have to put both hands back, flip up the bottom of the cami, wrap my fingers around the belt loops, and pull as hard as I can. Why are they so hard and tight to get on, but then they feel like they're sliding down? Oh, and I tried going down a size, but that just made the sliding worse. I know I already posted this question, but I guess I wasn't clear in what I was asking. I am asking for an explanation as to WHY this happens.  Is it the fact that the jeans are so tight on the upper legs?  Is it my body type?  Is it the spandex blend in the denim?

20090226125624AAQqn89	Beauty & Style;Hair	Which is better on a straightener: titanium, tourmaline or ceramic?	I'm 15 and i have not so much curly but really poofy and needs to be straightened. Right now i am using my mothers straightener which i'm not sure what it is but for my birthday in a month she said she will get me my own except i don't know what kind to get. I want one that will make my hair shiny and make it appear thinner as my hair is really poofy and its shoulder length too. So I need to know what is better on a straightener: titanium, tourmaline or ceramic...... or if there are other kinds - and the price ranges.

20090226125321AAhvL4h	Beauty & Style;Hair	What kind of straightener should I buy?	So I've never owned a straightener before. I have naturally straight hair, except for the last inch or two on the bottom of my hair which flips up a little, no styling required. So you may be thinking, "Well, what does she want a straightener for?"      A. Because I want to flatten the flip sometimes, because the same hairstyle every time I wear my hair down is annoying.      B. Because sometimes I'll wear my hair up during the day and then it has ponytail kinks in it, which is very unfortunate if I want to wear my hair down when I go out later that night. The only way to do it now is to wet my hair and re-dry it, which is annoying and time-consuming.      So my problem is that I've never owned a straightener before. I plan on going to Target to buy one, and my budget is $30. I know this won't add up to a really good straightener, but considering my hair isn't unruly in the least, I'm not worried. So as long as it won't fry my hair, what should I buy?      P.S. The time is takes to heat up is not an issue; I'm a very patient person and I don't care either way.
