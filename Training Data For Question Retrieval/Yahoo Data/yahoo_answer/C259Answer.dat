n3T4icxtaa	mmm... Circa 20 mi pare.  Ma io non faccio testo. I miei cd sono quasi tutti originali e ascoltando musica "datata"  facile trovarne anche per meno di 10.  Certo che hai ragione... Pi vendono e pi li paghi. Non dovrebbe essere cos secondo la legge di mercato.  Per questo evito di acquistare cd appena usciti.  Poi, a dirla tutta, a me vasco, liga e pausini fanno proprio cacare quindi non mi pongo il problema...    Buona giornata!

In una puntata lo scienziato notava che il passaggio del pilota dalla navetta al robot era di circa 10 secondi dove il nostro eroe era alla merc dei cattivi. Cos spostarono i comandi della navetta direttamente nella cabina del robot in modo che quei secondi venissero aboliti e gli fornirono degli aerei di agganciamento rapido per non perdere tempo a rientrare nella "navetta madre".  Sembrava pi vero.  Ora che le trasformazioni (come nel caso di sailor moon) sono, per lo pi, magiche... perch non credere che per la stessa magia tutto intorno si ferma per qualche secondo?  Ciao.|`|gTkaaWT7aa	..me lo sono sempre chiesta anche io... forse la loro lunghissima trasformazione per indossare body, minigonna, colletto, guanti e scarpe (vedi sailor moon) ha un effetto ipnotico sui nemici.. oppure li fa addormentare e cos han tutto il tempo di farsi belle ;ob|`|NszAuooDaa	a quanto pare si!|`|6b8hYQwHaa	me lo sono sempre chiesto ti accndo una stellina cosi che tutti possano rispondere   cmq non  lunica cosa poco realistica di un cartone XDXD|`|2Q8kGFkkaa	si quasi sempre|`|M5f8GMvlaa	mistero degli anime!  sar uno degli ultimi misteri irrisolti della scienza......mi sa che ho esagerato!|`|AnH7EMNcaa	Infatti, me lo sn kiesto sempre anke io.

Ti stressano in un modo terribile:p Per se uno vorrebbe correre in loro difesa, potrebbe dire che ci che tu vedi  la trasformazione(nel caso in questione, la trasformazione di sailor moon), il tempo rallenta nel cartone, cosicch mentre tu ti angosci interminabili secondi ad aspettare la mutazione, nel cartone i cattivi hanno solo un lasso di tempo molto breve per intervenire, ed ecco che i cartoni vincono...;)

Un guazzabuglio di luoghi comuni dei film horror di serie B, pi effetti speciali degni dell'asilo!  Insomma un film che pi triste non si pu!

Il bello  che prende evidentemente spunto da un altro film,  "Due ore ancora" (di cui  stato fatto anche un remake "DOA, Dead on arrival"), ma riesce a rendere la storia una vera imbecillit (mentre nei precedenti era molto interessante), con effettacci da 2 soldi, riprese rotolanti da schizofrenico, una recitazione e una regia da ricovero e un finale da dar fuoco al dvd (per disperazione). Sono arrivato alla fine, solo per vedere fino a che punto un film pu essere fatto male (e questo  andato pure oltre...)    Se incontro il regista e lo sceneggiatore, giuro che gli sputo in un occhio...anzi, spero siano un tutt'uno, cos evito sprechi di saliva!!!|`|zliNXFwsaa	The hole e chiamta da uno sconosciuto... sono due cose orrende e senza senso... e ti viene da ridere pensando che hanno speso milioni per farli...|`|iqSe17jvaa	direi birth io sono shon uno strazio dall inizio alla fine e ultimamente ho visto tt i numeri del sesso..ke gran cagatona ..ma ce ne stanno di film horrible|`|aCzTDmYyaa	the blair witch projet ASSOLUTAMENTE UNA CAGATA BESTIALE.....alla fine del film sono rimasto interdetto 2 ore sulla poltrona|`|jpvSPr1Faa	paganini horror (horror talmente idiota che  la commedia pi elisarante che ho mai visto)    alex l'ariete (commento come quello di sopra, solo che questo dovrebbe essere 'drammatico')    diverse commedie americane recenti come 3CIENTO o EPIC MOVIE    ce ne sono tanti...|`|d9834fb8123bd7c387441278c18b1507aa	dead doll,fa proprio skifo|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	non  un paese per vecchi. alla fine del film, quando si son riaccese le luci, in sala c'era il gelo...l'ho anche commentato negativamente su milano tonight,  dire che in genere sono abbastanza clemente.

RM1w2ETNaa	io l'ho visto e ti posso assicurare ke non  assolutamente pauroso (magari certe scene fanno solo un p skifo)...i film paurosi sono ben altri!!!cmq la cosa "tragica"  ke, quando usc il film, la protagonista -all'epoca adolescente-venne allontanata da tutti xk a quei tempi c'era molta ignoranza e si pensava ke fosse veramente posseduta...PoVEra!!!!Bacini la morettina...!!!e buon horror!!!|`|eRheGZBsaa	vedilo insieme ad amici, quelli pi spiritosi, cos magari facendo battute sulle scene, ridendo avrai meno paura!|`|lG6bTPO0aa	mirala|`|Ouay1CDXaa	1 perche' i film horror sono il mio genere preferito.Non mi sono per nulla impressionata|`|g4183owLaa	anche secondo me, non dovresti guardarlo da sola!  A me ha lasciato un po' di sgomento quel film.... vero ci sono film che a livello psicologico fanno molta pi paura, ma bisogna ammettere che  molto forte|`|RsXDortxaa	nessuno ti costringe, sentiti libera. e se ti fa impressione, beh, chiudi tutto e metti una bella commedia!!|`|fgXLmzTkaa	beh, per l'epoca in cui  uscito  fatto abbastanza bene... e anche oggi mi sembra un ottimo film.  uno dei pochi horror che posso guardare senza sganasciarmi dalle risate. la maggior parte sono ammantati di ridicolo e di falsa suspense|`|mvuhfHSOaa	a differenza di molti altri film horror, questo non fa proprio PAURA ma ti IMPRESSIONA, la differenza  che in molti altri film, sai benissimo che quelle che vedi sono tutte stupidate frutto dell'immaginazione fervida di qualche psicopatico regista e produttore, invece con l'esorcista  diverso, infatti nel film si parla del diavolo e dell'intervento della chiesa per l'esorcismo in se stesso, delle cose VERE che esistono realmente nella vita degli uomini, ed  questo ci che ha fatto la fortuna di questo film. Le scene in se stesse sono pi splatter che di tensione ma  quello che ti porta a pensare che ti fa paura ....  vero ? ..... potrebbe capitare a chiunque ? potrebbe capitare anche a me ? ......  da qu che ti impressioni e ti nasce la paura del buio, dello stare soli e del solamente "pensare" a queste cose.    Il tutto ovviamente  a mio parere. Buona Visione !!!|`|UHgRWOzsaa	l'erorcista  un film bellissimo ma come tutti gli horror fa un p paura.... xcio o lo guardi con i tuoi amici oppure basta ke per tutto il tempo ti ricordi ke qll  solo un film, pensando ke nn potr mai succedere a te ( io fo sempre cos) kiss|`|6yNWXSYTaa	nn vederlo da sola...  da 1 a 10 secondo me fa paura fino ad 8...  x me fa + paura It: il Pagliaccio ke gli do un 9      ciao!|`|AebtkSSpaa	Mah... sec. me non esiste film + stupido... sar perch a me i film di paura :D non fanno paura, cmq  una cosa soggettiva guardalo insieme a qualcuno e vedrai che alla fne  anche divertente... :D  ciaooooooooooooo|`|oiwg8T6Gaa	Pesante quel film, non vederlo da sola!|`|nAFAsbcIaa	ma quale paura|`|WFU6Yp5laa	predilo come una giostra paurosa. fai un profondo respiro e fai play. dalla giostra non si scende e tu non interrompere il film. ^_^|`|glHOw4zxaa	ti consiglio di vederlo in compagnia|`|PpEKxH5haa	A me fa ridere.

tuATxHsVaa	I own both Casio and Yamaha keyboards - and a Korg Triton, etc.     The Yamaha piano sound always sounds entirely more realistic to me. It makes sense, considering Casio is not in the business of building grand pianos. They build cheap electronic watches ... and sometimes keyboards.    Although I agree with Jones that Polyphony will not noticeably change the realism - a good engineer or sound tech will be able to tell. The polyphony levels create more realistic string dampening effects (when you press notes, the overtones - the harmonic series - is produced by each key that you strike). The ability to produce more pitches creates more realistic overtones and a more realistic dampening effect is produced. This is assuming that your piano is programmed correctly in the first place to reproduce overtones. Good Steinway piano VST instruments do this and use the polyphony levels to achieve the effect.    The odd glissando might bring it out, too. Perhaps "Pour le Piano" by Debussy, mvmt 1. You might notice notes cutting out - especially during the non-gliss portions of the piece where you hold down the damper pedal for extended periods of time.     I think the conclusion I have arrived at is that - yes - polyphony will alter your ability to perform a few select pieces. But, this is a minor point.    If you do MIDI compositions, then you might require the 128 note polyphony. Otherwise, since you don't have 64 hands, you will never notice that you can't achieve 65 note polyphony (until you hit the damper and try to strike all the keys at once with a board... yes this is called for in a few rare pieces... =D).      But all things considered, I think Yamaha always has better sounds. *Maybe* Casio has changed this - but their old sounds were always terrible. They were always better with built-in synths and gizmos rather than sounds and playability. What do you expect from a company that makes watches and random electric gizmos? They aren't a music company per se at all. Yamaha is.    Those are my 2 cents.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Not necessarily. The sample set and the sample rate will determine the better sound quality. In this case, however, I like the ZPI sounds on the Casio Privias.    ... as for bells-and-whistles... the Arius YDP-160 has few. But it's a nice piano for the price in a proper cabinet with a proper bench.

ciXSjbCiaa	I have NO idea but I was really disappointed that they were set up. I don't think they were a good match at all!!!!! He is such an educated, classy, nice guy. Lola had such a dull personality and looked so plasticky and strange. I think they would look like such an odd couple together. It seemed like he just needed a companion, anyone that was willing to give him attention that he didn't need to work for (since he seems more shy and passive) and that she wanted a succesful guy. I think MM is irresponsible for setting such a nice guy up with a girl that looks like that. Sorry, just my 2 cents.

I always grate or slice cheese myself because they add something to the cheese to stop it from sticking together after they grate it.  As for which tastes better I think I prefer sliced cheese but only because of the difference in texture, the rest of the flavour is the same of course.|`|u23sua9daa	Grated cheese taste better.|`|UnbudISCaa	I like grated cheese better.|`|iJ3BeFWxaa	Grated Cheese is definitely better !!|`|jJ06EBLuaa	I think grated cheese tastes better|`|E7ViD8EWaa	Sliced.

It sounds like it was worked on and crafted over a long period of time, and it stands out among the other 'tallica solos.

ApEkhjcDaa	You just have to keep practising bar chords... it's sad but true. They really do hurt your fingers, but if you keep practising them your fingers will toughen up. Try looking online for tips on how to play bar chords well. However, you could also try substituting the bar chords for power chords. It won't sound as good, but it'll still be okay. Good luck, and keep trying :)|`|RE6BBaeSaa	Make sure your thumb is in the middle as opposed to the rest of your fingers. If you have big hands and fingers, you can palm the neck and use you thumb for the E string.  Have your index finger lean a bit diagonal so that the side of your index pushes down on all the strings. The rest of your fingers need to really push perpendicular on the frets so as to not obstruct other notes. It takes a lot of practise.|`|WBVaugjgaa	use your index finger to bar your finger across the 6th fret.    then 3rd finger on the A on the 8th fret.  and 4th finger behind that one on the D on the 8th fret.    have the second finger between index and third on the G of the 7th fret.    that's the correct way to play the chord.    just move that around to the desired frets.    just keep practicing and you should be fine.|`|7L60FeYxaa	You'll find there will be quite a few sites that give you bar chords. Don't worry, I find them hard too. Try using open chords instead:    Bb: xx0331  Gm: xx0111  Tip: hold all three strings down with your index finger, then use your middle finger to reinforce that pressure on the strings  Cm: xx1013  Eb: xx5343  Tip: Hold the last three strings on the 3rd fret all down with your index finger, then use your middle finger for the 4 and the ring finger for the 5    I'm not sure if I made this clear enough, but I hope I helped, email me if you need more help: tezzamonkey@gmail.com    Tezza

bXL9937haa	I am really unsure about this one. I feel that it will take a while for any doctor to find out the core of the problem. However, my advice to you is don't stop trying. You feel as if this is going no where. I have a feeling that you will succeed with determination and faith. Be strong and keep your head held high. You seem to me like a great mom. My thoughts and prayers are with you!|`|jNiCHwamaa	I'm really sorry to hear about your son. Try seeing a child psychologist cuz social and development problems is their field. I wonder why that paeditrician is not referring you to a specialist. Hope your son gets better and you find the answer to his condition.

rpUSdu1Eaa	Besides Springsteen there is a Traveling Wilburys song called "Tweeter and the Monkey Man" which mentions the Jersey line.|`|F6Zh3YzXaa	I can't say names of songs off the top of my head, but check out Bruce Springsteen. I live in Jersey and he lives practically in my town!|`|f8CN2qIvaa	I can think of two Bruce Springsteen songs off the top of my head...  Rosalita--"My machine she's a dud, stuck in the mud                 Somewhere in the swamps of Jersey.."  Jungleland--"...over the Jersey state line...|`|tyTJE8vxaa	Yeah a lot of Springsteen songs, while they might not directly mention it, do reference some aspect of NJ or life therein e.g Born To Run is about getting out of Asbury Park
G8d9YtLjaa	I can see where your question is coming from, as you obviously understand there is a C  in the D minor scale (harmonic).    When a piece is written in Dm (as per your example!), the key signature (Bb) actually belongs to D natural minor, and all C's in the piece will be natural ... UNLESS, as Doctor John said, it appears with an accidental (of C .)   (This happens when the 7th is raised, changing a natural minor to an harmonic minor).    In short, keep it natural unless stated otherwise in the key signature or as an accidental.    Hope this helps! Good Luck!|`|DMpVSHvXaa	If  1. There is a sharp sign in front of it.  2. There has been a C  previously in the same measure, and this sharp has not been canceled out with a natural sign.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Only if it appears as an accidental|`|mvjsSMMEaa	depends if you have    4      |----  ...   |----   4      |----       ^       |     those...     but other than that... if you playing in minor you should be playing Flats not sharps :O|`|oXpURg2Qaa	Yes, the previous answers say it all - Cs are only sharp if there is an accidental in the bar (measure), either in front of the C or in the same bar but in front of an earlier C.    Note also that many pieces in the minor key will have a mix of C sharps and C naturals, especially melodic lines, so keep your eyes peeled as to which Cs have been altered and which haven't.|`|19YfKNpJaa	Play the notes on the page.  If it says C-natural, it probably means it...

h1IYS0dbaa	You made a terrible mistake.    You should have watched the Austrian original of the movie:    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119167/    It's with Ulrich Mhe who played in the movie "Das Leben der Anderen" (The Lives of Others). The latter movie won an Oscar for best foreign movie in 2007 and is ranked 54 in imdb.      ***    Remakes usually suck...|`|ar4B3rJJaa	I feel the same way. My dad had told me about that movie and when i watched it, I thought it was the dumbest cold hearted movie i have ever watched. There was too much weirdness to the movie. The beginning starts off so weird and i thought the characters Paul and Tubby were so heartless to torture that family and kill the son first. I also didnt get why Paul called Peter/tobby so many different names in the movie. It made it really confuesing. I personally think that the movie had no point. The end also ended really badly and weird. When watching a movie, people would normally think that it would have a happy ending or become a sequel, but this movie ended with no point. And when tobby killed Gorgie (the son) I thought that the parents had no emotion during that part after actually seeing someone kill their son. It wasnt realistic. Normal parents would go crazy if they saw someone kill their son. I think that movie deserved NO stars. It was so pointless and stupid. Only someone cold hearted and weird would make a movie like that.|`|WAYzEOFFaa	I think it was intended to be more of an art film.  I discussed it with one of my friends who is "all about film" and he summarised it as demonstrating that the violence that you can imagine is always far worse than the violence you actually see.  That's why a lot of the violence occurs outside of the shot you see and that which you do see is either deceptive or in one case rewinded so it doesn't really happen.    I found the film VERY tense and can see it's merits but can also nderstand where you are coming from.    If you've not seen it try the Descent, had me hiding for most of it!

You should check out the entire symphony.  It is a wonderful piece of music.|`|G8d9YtLjaa	Exactly as Ryan K said!

dbcILDdSaa	I think the reason they fired the actors that play Marlena and John is so that the show can stay on the air for another 18 months. But I agree the writer are doing not such a good job! Its like the writer are watching the old episodes of Days and re-writing them, the baby switch, seeing vision....I hope that Days can survive, I have been watching for 20 years!|`|WUnEENDQaa	it really looks that way.  letting go of john/marlena...steve/kayla was a big mistake, esp for the ppl who've been watching since the 60's/70's.  they may as well wrap it up.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	This was suppose to be the last year. i think Days will be picked up by Soap Net, much like Passions was. and will continue on in syndication.  or at least i hope so!|`|Ho4xK8DDaa	From what I heard, in about 10 years we'll be lucky if any of the soap operas are still on the air.  Days is definitely one that is going downhill, that's why they are getting rid of some of their higher paid actors/actresses, to try to keep it on the air just a little while longer.  Days used to be my favorite soap, but, lately some of the storylines are just stupid. One I currently don't like right now is the visions Bo is having.  Just dumb and I read a spoiler that Hope is going to move out because Bo didn't tell her about the vision about her shooting Kayla.  I also heard Kayla and Steve are the next on their way out.  I do hope the writers can turn it around, but, I wonder if they will be able to before it gets the boot.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	I hope it doesn't go off the air, been watching DAYS since I was 5 yrs old with my Mother. Days in the best soap opera on TV.

Abe and that lousy wife of his Lexi needs to go. I would not want her to be my DR, I would end up dead for sure and she is a lousy mother. They are letting all the good ones go and now Steve and Kayla are leaving the show...:o( I pray the writers get their act together soon.  :o)|`|TkUF1PI4aa	The show IS going downhill.

(i'm attracted to them anyway) cause acting like that you can't really impress the girl next door. and i don't want them anyway.    so it's a win win strategy that works just in the way i want. if they are not interested with me then they can not be interesting themselves and i don't want the ordinary.
miqVrrOxaa	Disciple - Things Left Unsaid    Lyrics: http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/T...    For me, this song is fairly easy to connect with. It talks about a loved one who falls sick/is hurt and is in hospital. The singer is saying how he remembers before the person went to hospital and how things were totally normal.     The sick/hurt person must be in a fairly critical condition and the singer is worried that they will die without knowing that the singer loved them, as he never took the time to tell them so.     It reflects to me how people can get caught up with just expecting that person to always be there and when something happens, it could all be changed in an instant. That person could be taken from this earth without knowing how much you fully appreciate and love them.    It talks about how people take life for granted and often forget or don't get the courage to tell someone how they truly feel about that person.     : )|`|37sh2ez7aa	'I wake up every evening with a big smile on my face' :)    lol i can relate b/c it's true haha im always happy when i wake up and im a kid so i get up late too :)|`|Xea4tc3laa	Graffiti decorations  Under a sky of dust  A constant wave of tension  On top of broken trust  The lessons that you taught me  I learn were never true  Now I find myself in question  (They point the finger at me again)  Guilty by association  (You point the finger at me again)    I wanna run away  Never say goodbye  I wanna know the truth  Instead of wondering why  I wanna know the answers  No more lies  I wanna shut the door  And open up my mind    - To me this is a good breakup song, talking about someone who has been cheated on. I've been on the recieving end of that a few times. And running away when you find out is about the only thing that makes sense.

uel6NBOVaa	I'm not the Libra stereotype. I am independent and a bit of a loner, though I love my friends and prefer to keep only a few people really close to me. I have nothing against violence, in fact I take interest in the darker side of life. I am not afraid of confrontation, and I love to argue...though I do think that is a Libra thing, even though people consider us to be "peace-makers". I am very good at seeing all sides of an issue like a Libra, and I can change myself to fit into almost any situation. I can be charming when I want to be, and perhaps a bit on the fake/manipulative side at my worst. I am moody, and can go from calm to explosive in a few seconds. I am very talkative and intellectual like an air sign, and mental stimulation is very important to me. I am competitive, and extreme about the things I feel passionate about, but I am quick to forgive and good at rationalizing situations. In general, I'm a respectful person as long as that respect is given to me.|`|qnBVKBJIaa	I'm a Libra.    I'm not social at all, but one common trait of Libras that I have is that I don't like confrontation.  I want everything to be fair, but when I finally make someone happy, he or she will take advantage of me.  It is common that Libras get taken advantage of.|`|bjtXNCoSaa	i don't think I'm a typical Libra I'm usually shy when i first meet someone but i warm up really fast um i am really talkative i don't like to have usually more then one or two really close friends idk why i have a thing for Scorpios when i supposed to like Leo lol  i don't like fighting or yelling even though my parents are separated so it happens quite a lot and i kind really hate to be given the silent treatment  but id love to chat or email pen pal i was born October 11

0IKwusdgaa	Cancer in venus and mars in taurus is a good combo because they are very similar. If youre a girl you would attract Taurus or Scorpio or someone with a mixture of both - cos they are infact very, very similar. If you are a guy you would attract girls who are Cancer or Scorpio which again are very similar which is still very good. So basically you would attract a guy that is similar to you in love.     No matter what, you are always attracted to Scorpios(DES) and Tauruses(AS) because your ascendent and descendent determines who are attracted to. Another plus side is the Mars in Taurus. You may attract fire signs or you attracted to fire signs however you are more of the stable side, unless the des, as and mars is similar to you.     You may also consider looking at your Eros sign as that is the way you express sexually and your sexual style. Ive seen that people who have thier Eros sign in as, des or mars are deeply attracted to thier Eros sign - im an example.

bXL9937haa	Well, I am answering this because I am a Virgo and have many male Virgo friends. To me it seems like he is doing the same thing to you as you did to him. Just to see a reaction. Virgos are like that. Also, space is important since they try to prefect everything they do. As far as sex goes, you probably won't feel much of a connection. Most Sag. friends I know think Virgo's are not passionate enough and boring. Gemini's are more their style, at least the Sag.'s I know. Good luck and I hope I've helped.|`|ttJTNVpqaa	i dated Virgo men they are unbelievable boring if you like him enough why not just do fun things that you like as well he will like that and try to  balances it out either doing what you think is boring and wonder if his worth it|`|mtF6bJ85aa	its been four months and you want sex lmao  no seriously saggi if you want sex  you could easily seduce  virgo you saggi are wild people why dont you start it  ;)  virgos are not clingy people neither are saggi why are you complaining dont  you like freedom sagititarius

Wouldn't say much, I did all the talking and I felt like he didn't care about what I had to offer. But I think as he starts getting more comfortable with you, he will open up. You just have to spend a little more time with him, make him laugh it really impresses them. Talk about random things and tease them around, make fun of them a little but not too harsh because it really does hurt them.     ?

GG1oN4rSaa	Yes of course but too bad there are no real rappers anymore :(     The only person that can give you the oldskool gangsta rap is The Game    But when I say I like rap I mean Tupac, N.W.A.( dre.dre ice cube eazy e   mc ren etc) and biggie too|`|Belb1stLaa	rap, because it's what i grew up listening to|`|FQndxhQ3aa	1. Yes.  2. Because I said so.|`|4YmB7q5jaa	yea i do, because i do|`|7TWAEBleaa	yes. i like underground hip hop cause you can relate to what there saying but not really into radio hip hop cause the **** they play is straight garbage.|`|c4r6jwLjaa	yes. rap is a way of expressing yourself and your feelings just like any other form of music.|`|j6LjVvWCaa	Yeah but not all of the mainstream crap they put out these days. It's like they don't make it for the music anymore. They just want the money, fame, and girls. It's not real. Plus, I don't like how women in mainstream rap are always shown as bitches and hoes. Yeah, I'm aware they exist and I'm not saying we should pretend like they don't but why can't we bring more shine to the independent women, the strong women, the classy women. There are plenty of them out there too. Plus they use the excuse sex sells. But, does that mean you should sell out? I think not. That's why it's funny to me when rappers will be like "i'm the realest **** out there!". No you're not! Your just rapping whatever that corporate CEO tells you too. Plus I think there is a way to make things look sexy without looking slutty. Also, rappers can be more creative with their videos. It's always the same thing. See, rap used to be good before all it became about what sells and whatever new craze is out.|`|gRIaPRcvaa	Yeah, but some of it is just crap. lol  umm i dont realy have a reson. so...?|`|RWZbnHrdaa	I sure do!!!!! Sometimes its music you can relate to an other times itsjust comical. Its all just a bunch of punch lines one after another set to a hot beat.  Plus that's where you hear some of the slang from.|`|6J5mQWj0aa	i love hip hop what about u its like it use to tale a stroy insted of taling lies and about what u havent done or seen|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Yes.

I listen to all types of rap not just mainstream. I listen to da underground, those crazy Christians givin God the glory, those Experimental rappers who either sound really good or really stupid, I listen to the occasional techno rap, I listen to the rare rock/rap collaboration. I LOVE RAP!
e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	    Nothing wrong with womanly curves :)|`|94d71e16d44c1dd2c91192f4a5798259aa	Um...no....I disagree|`|bXL9937haa	One of my good friends is an Aqua and she is a stick. No curves just really skinny and she has had 3 kids! She looks amazing!|`|XVYe1MnYaa	i do look curvy dont i|`|MtANnIlfaa	I've never met a "full" aquarius woman.. take my aquarius ex best friend for example.. she is 5'2 and ways 98lbs.. she is skin and bones but eats like a monster.. same goes for my older aquarian aunt who is 5'7 and i dont know how much she weighs but i can tell you she has no meat on her and they are both size 00.. good thing they are gorgeous girls so them not having curves doesn't really bother anyone....    Scorpio|`|xpiGWrdMaa	I think even Aquarian males are supposed to have wider hips. I think Aquarians are all supposed to have something effeminate about them.    I have uranus in my 1H. Perhaps this is my problem. I have wider hips and I hate them!|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I do. I've never noticed if all aquarian women do though|`|rnqgiRkWaa	i no a couple of aquarians that are very skinny|`|3WItFAwlaa	Yeah.    But my opinion doesn't mean that much.|`|AA11899483	i know 2 aquarian girls, they are like size zero,, like a tree lol, but i think figure shape doesnt have much to do with sun sign, but ascendant and planets aspecting it and planets in 1st house.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Some are, but not all.

We all have an ego attached to us.|`|u0DCP1OSaa	im a leo..im relly hurt lol jk.. i think i like to make myself look pretty but i also like having aa personality that shines bright and i do:)|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	No offense to Aries, but they're the ones I always see saying that they're the best. Also, *some* Leos do that too.|`|dZEHLoXxaa	leo|`|0HGqGJYTaa	The earth signs...try dating any 3 of them. Down to earth my ***    Taurus pride    Virgo perfection    Caps are "know it alls"- I remember him saying on one of our first dates "you should be trying to impress me". Sorry, to me that's classic, and the epitome of arrogance.|`|edJtHlDiaa	Imo aries is first to get that prize because i dated an aries guy and he was full of himself and it just got on my nerves so much,because he would always put himself first and put me last and i hated that,and leo a little bit but not as bad as aries.|`|GLDXjJfaaa	i think aries just love life, they may seem cocky but they are the most straightforward and honest people. you wont get no passive aggressive crap with these guys.  they are number 1 for making people feel better and getting them motivated and they usually wont stand for any injustice or bullshit.    Leo on the other hand, dear me..at times they are absoloutly ******* blind to whats really going on and get in a pathetic sulk when theyre faced with normal everyday reality checks. they dont care about ****, morals, peoples feelings ect as long as they are being seen and heard.  a good amount of dictators have been leo lol|`|631c8fd5c39d806e031079d8fccb75f9aa	Scorpio and Aries...Something about that Mars energy does it.      Yes, Leos can come off as VERY conceited sometimes, but most of them are just insecure as hell and it makes them roar a lot and self-obsess.      Both Scorpio and Aries KNOW they're right, and you best not even argue about it.  You will not win...despite this, I love both signs terribly much.|`|VHxZuaOfaa	the fire signs mostly     Aries  Leo    Aries they love competition and have to be the top person they will boast even if they lose    Leo but they know when to shut up|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Aries and Leo|`|bXL9937haa	Definitely Aries. They have to be  1 at everything they do and have a I can do no wrong attitude. Most don't even listen to what someone is trying to tell them. It goes in one ear and out the other. Very selective hearing. If you ask one of them they are the best and there is no discussion unless you want a punch in the face.     Leo's are like that at times. However, when you call them out on something they get shy and private. Unlike the Aries. Leo's like the show. Being in the spotlight. However, I don't see them as conceited as the Aries.|`|94d71e16d44c1dd2c91192f4a5798259aa	Aries fersure!!!!|`|vmv1rP76aa	Wow...tough one. Most would say Leos (I am a Leo), and we do have a sense of pride but most often we are more gentle and not so much vain.     I'd say its a toss-up between Cancers (big moody insecure bastarrds), Taurus (they're a bit vocal and overconfident), and Scorpios (they know they're sexy and they got it like that).|`|t6wmRfoZaa	yep we leos are the worst i'm so hot i'd date myself if i could|`|VCF9os1jaa	Well the signs I have observed primping and preening, pissing them off if you tell them that shirt makes them look fat, when they asked, are...Pisces, Leo, Virgo. You didn't ask, who was more competitive. Now with Leo, it could be more a matter of pride, not conceit. I have met many Aries and Scorpio, and I haven't observed conceit in them. Competitive yes, conceit no. I'm an Aries, and I can tell you, I am the furthest from conceited as you can get. I am highly competitive, and straightforward. I don't primp and preen, and I don't have to look in the mirror a half a dozen times a day. And my nose isn't in the air, from fear of drowning, if it were to rain. And whatever sign John Edwards is, singing "Im so Pretty", while he brushes his hair in front of the mirror. How embarrassing :)|`|BXe211Fvaa	oh jesus with the generalizing.  but from my experience aries...my moms one.  i don't like answering these questions cuz I don't believe in this stuff ahah but i will answer anyway.  oh and theres this leo that literally will do anything to embarrass herself just for attention.   i mean she doesn't even act much like a female should. i mean the way she acts is crazy and immature and so high maintenance. it can be ridiculous.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Leo|`|plBXp91Daa	Lolzzz @ Trill  Yes it is true that Leo's think that they are all that but i think there is nothing wrong with that,as long you don't hurt someone with your ego.
dDhTMacAaa	not badd man    idk those rappers    where are the answerers??

BAkvtl36aa	Yes I did this test. It was pretty easy. Your teacher (u have one right?) should give u the pieces or u should have a list of the pieces you have to do.   Then I remember they played a note on the piano (twice I think) which you had to listen to carefully and then say/sing out loud (a simple 'la' is fine you don't have to actually sing it!) I think that is the aural bit. And then they might just point to some notes and ask u what notes they r and that's about it! Hope this helps!! Trust me it's really easy!!

Eu traduz as partes mais importantes. Veja seu resumo em portugus.   Leia agora o final de "A Caverna do Drag?o"    Esse resumo  uma tradu??o livre do Captulo Final, "Requiem", da Caverna do Drag?o. O texto original em ingls  oficial, mas a tradu??o n?o. Enfatizamos o fato de ser apenas um resumo. O episdio  descrito com grande riqueza de detalhes na pgina de Michael Reavers. Aqui  enfatizada a seqncia final do episdio, que consideramos o assunto de maior interesse.     No inicio do captulo final, o Vingador e o Mestre dos Magos encontram-se. O Vingador prop?e um teste para a coragem dos garotos. Caso eles sejam bem-sucedidos, eles encontrar?o a chave. Caso fracassem, perder?o tudo, tanto suas armas quanto suas vidas. "Assim seja", diz o Mestre dos Magos.     Em outra cena, aparece diante dos garotos uma hidra, um monstro de vrias cabe?as. Eles s?o observados pelo Mestre dos Magos e pelo Vingador. Tentam inutilmente derrotar o monstro e, em situa??o de extremo perigo, pedem ajuda ao Mestre dos Magos, que diz, severamente: "Vocs entraram nessa situa??o sozinhos, meus jovens amigos... ent?o saiam dela sozinhos." E desaparece.     Aps um esfor?o sobre-humano, eles finalmente derrotam a hidra, e come?am uma longa jornada. Desolados, acreditam que foram abandonados pelo Mestre dos Magos. O Vingador aparece e diz que o Mestre dos Magos finalmente revelou sua verdadeira face. O Vingador prop?e enviar os garotos de volta para casa em troca de um favor: devem ir em dire??o  fronteira do reino, onde encontrar?o um mausolu. L, haver uma chave que eles devem jogar no abismo.     Eric, Presto e Sheila pensam ser essa a nica maneira de voltar para casa. Hank, Diana e Bobby dizem que jamais confiaram no Vingador. Os dois grupos se separam e seguem por caminhos distintos, mas ambos em dire??o  fronteira do reino. O grupo liderado por Eric encontra um navio, que Presto faz voar. O grupo de Hank segue voando em um drag?o de bronze.     Hank: "Por que voc acha que estamos aqui, Diana ?".     Diana: "No Reino ? Sempre acreditei que fosse para derrotar o Vingador".     Hank: "Eu tambm, mas talvez o Vingador tenha raz?o. Talvez as coisas n?o sejam t?o simples".     Os dois grupos acabam encontrando-se no ar, e Hank pede que o outro grupo pare. Eric diz que  a nica maneira de voltarem para casa. Hank tenta for?-los a parar com uma flecha, e acaba derrubando-os. Hank, Diana e Bobby acreditam que os demais est?o mortos.     Muda a cena pro mausolu, em que est?o o Vingador e o Mestre dos Magos.     Vingador: "Voc perder, velho. O desejo que eles tem de voltar para casa  mais forte do que tudo. Sem seu apoio eles estar?o perdidos".     Mestre dos Magos: "Sua coragem n?o falhar. Eles far?o o que deve ser feito."     Vingador: "Veremos. H algo no mausolu que testar sua coragem."     Descobre-se que Eric, Presto e Sheila sobreviveram  queda. Eles caminham em dire??o ao mausolu. Eric, Bobby e Diana fazem o mesmo, mas um grupo n?o pode ver o outro devido ao terreno acidentado. Eles entram, e acabam se encontrando, com grande alegria.     H uma nova discuss?o para saber se eles far?o ou n?o o que o Vingador solicitou. Ent?o, surge um monstro enorme, um amebide, que os ataca. Eles correm e lutam contra o amebide, at que, aps muito esfor?o de todos, Bobby consegue enterr-lo sob uma parede. Como isso acaba impedindo o caminho, eles s?o obrigados a seguir em frente, para desgosto de Hank.     Mestre dos Magos: "Eles est?o vindo, Vingador. Cheios de dvidas e suspeitas uns em rela??o aos outros, mas ainda est?o vindo."     Vingador: "Eles ainda podem falhar... E falhar?o. N?o celebre sua vitria ainda, velho."     Mestre dos Magos: "N?o sou eu quem ser o vencedor, Vingador. Ser voc."     Os garotos entram no santurio, que agora est vazio, exceto por eles e por um sarcfago. Diana aponta para uma parede quebrada, alm da qual h um abismo. Os garotos aproximam-se calmamente, e observam um precipcio sem fim, envolto em nvoa noturna - a fronteira do reino.  Estrelas cintilam na profundezas do abismo, e pilares do tamanho de um continente sustentam o reino.     Sheila aproxima-se da abbada, onde h uma fechadura praticamente escondida. Presto aproxima-se do sarcfago, onde h uma figura esculpida.  um homem em armadura de guerreiro, bra?os cruzados sobre o trax. Seu rosto, apesar de nobre a sereno, sem asas, chifre e outros tra?os de maldade,  inquestionavelmente o Vingador.     Eles abrem o sarcfago, onde h apenas uma chave de metal ordinrio. Eric diz: "Temos a chave. Basta jog-la no abismo para irmos para casa." Hank responde: "Voc ainda n?o entendeu que jamais iremos para casa confiando no Vingador ?" Eles discutem e lutam pela chave. Hank diz: "Eric, lembra-se do que voc disse sobre todo esse reino ser uma pris?o ? Eu acho que voc est certo. Todos somos prisioneiros aqui - inclusive o Vingador. E esta  a chave."     A discuss?o  in|`|12a07fc6a784292f8b4e810d3d9e0ae1aa	Todos conseguiram me deixar mais confusa, do q a prpria pergunta...|`|308ef8cd81f17cf74146622d8047f091aa	Meu  o seguinte, o ultimo episodio n?o foi escrito, ent?o s existem boatos (ou spoilers).

O pblico americano adorou a idia e a histria se repetiu aqui no Brasil quando a Rede Globo de Televis?o passou a exibir os episdios nas manh?s de domingo. Apesar do grande sucesso, a srie s teve trs temporadas e foi deixada de lado sem explica??o. Breve estaremos falando sobre os boatos de um possvel novo ano da srie.    ENREDO    Durante um passeio no novo parque de divers?es da cidade um grupo de crian?as resolve entrar em um novo brinquedo chamado Caverna do Drag?o (Dungeons and Dragons), uma espcie de trem fantasma. O problema  que o brinquedo  na verdade uma passagem interdimensional que leva os garotos a um mundo onde existem guerreiros, drag?es, magos, etc. Chegando l eles s?o recepcionados pelo Mestre dos Magos (Dungeon Master) que os ajuda, entregando armas mgicas para que eles se defendessem dos muitos perigos do local, como o Vingador e Tiamat. A srie gira em torno da busca do "caminho para casa" pelos heris. Ai existem dois problemas: eles teriam que deixar Uni, a unicrnio de Bobby, e todas as armas mgicas para trs. N?o poderiam lev-los para a Terra.     O FINAL DO DESENHO "A CAVERNA DO DRAG?O"    Ser que esta histria  verdadeira? N?o sabemos, mas vale pela curiosidade!   Diz a lenda que a Caverna do Drag?o era escrito por um grupo de jogadores de RPG e que depois de cada jogo, eles escreviam sua aventura e a transformavam em roteiro de desenho, para vender para a produtora.   Como todo jogo de RPG tem um final, o desenho tambm teve. Mas esse final nunca foi ao ar. Voc sabe por que? Porque a produtora n?o comprou o ltimo captulo da Caverna do Drag?o!. A produtora negou-se a comprar o final por ele ser, no mnimo, cruel. D uma olhada no esbo?o:   "Na ltima aventura deles, aquele drag?o de 7 cabe?as conta a verdade e depois eles a comprovam. O drag?o conta que nunca mais eles voltar?o para a Terra.   Nunca porque quando eles estavam descendo naquele carrinho da montanha russa, eles n?o entraram em outra dimens?o. O carrinho caiu... e eles morreram. Eles n?o v?o voltar porque eles est?o mortos. E l  o inferno!   Como nenhum deles era bonzinho na vida real, eles foram parar no inferno, depois que morreram na queda do carrinho e o dem?nio resolveu brincar com eles.   Cruel e sdico, o dem?nio s vezes aparecia de Vingador e s vezes de Mestre dos Magos! Os dois na verdade eram a mesma pessoa: o Dem?nio, sdico, jogando e brincando com os novos moradores de seu imprio!   O Drag?o na verdade  um anjo que vai at o inferno com a miss?o de tentar fazer com que eles descubram a verdade e que, depois de tantas tentativas, acaba por revel-la.   O dem?nio tinha um capeta que o auxiliava neste trabalho. Algum que sempre os impedia de voltar (ou seja de descobrir que n?o havia como voltar): a pequena unicrnio Uniii. Ela na verdade, era um enviado do dem?nio que os acompanhava todo tempo para atrapalh-los e brincar com seus sentimentos.   Nunca mais eles voltar?o e viver?o para SEMPRE naquele INFERNO. Essa  a verdade revelada oficialmente pelo Mestre desse jogo de Dungeons e Dragons.   Agora d para entender porque n?o produziram o ltimo captulo...?!"         --------------------------------------...      EPISDIO OFICIAL         Esta trama macabra foi amplamente divulgada na Internet e t?o bem contada que muita gente passou a tom-la como sendo verdadeira. Para acabar com as dvidas, a Heri 2000 conversou com dois roteiristas e o criador do desenho, que concordaram em uma coisa:  tudo papo furado! Gary Gyrax, produtor e criador de Caverna do Drag?o,  quem define: "N?o h verdade alguma nisso. Nenhum episdio assim foi produzido. Tiamat n?o  um anjo e nem ajuda de maneira nenhuma". J Mark Evanier, um dos roteiristas da srie,  mais enftico: "Isto  completamente falso! Apesar de vrios finais possveis terem sido discutidos, nenhum ltimo episdio foi realmente produzido". O escritor Michael Reaves, roteirista de oito episdios, completa: "Caverna do Drag?o foi um desenho muito sombrio para sua poca - tanto quanto  Grgulas hoje. Ns o levamos o mais longe possvel para um programa infantil". Apesar de Caverna ter sido um desenho  frente de seu tempo, Reaves diz que n?o haveria chance nenhuma de uma histria deste tipo ter ido ao ar: "Os garotos n?o ficaram presos no inferno, nem o Mestre dos Magos  o dem?nio ou coisa parecida. Essa histria toda  absurda", diz. Mas ent?o, qual  a verdade afinal?      O Verdadeiro Final         Ao final do terceiro ano da srie, a CBS decidiu colocar no ar um episdio que encerrasse a temporada. Michael Reaves escreveu aquele que pode ser considerado o verdadeiro ltimo captulo da srie: Requiem. "Este episdio foi escrito de forma que tivesse um duplo sentido, ambguo e triunfante: se o desenho n?o continuasse, o final seria satisfatrio; se continuasse, o episdio serviria de trampolim para uma nova dire??o". Reaves finalizou o Script de Requiem em maio de 1985. Para sua surpresa (e a de todos), a srie foi encerrada bruscamente e este roteiro acabou nunca saindo do papel. Gary Gyrax explica o fato: "Em 85, a equipe do desenho se reuniu com os executivos da Marvel e da CBS e foi decidido que a srie continuaria na temporada seguinte. Os seis garotos - mais velhos e experientes - seriam chamados de volta ao mundo da Caverna do Drag?o pelo Mestre dos Magos. Trs scripts do desenho foram feitos e eu at aprovei um deles. Mas algumas dificuldades surgiram. A D&D Corp. fechou e a CBS junto com a Marvel decidiu n?o continuar mais com o desenho.

O vingador pede que eles v?o para um lugar distante enfrentar om monstro e recuperar uma chave, chave esta que deveria ser intregue a ele dentro de um tal vulc?o.  Com essa prosposta e a falta de auxilio do mestre dos magos, ao amigos ficam em duvidas e e acabam brigando se separando em dois grupos.  no decorrer da histria ,quando conseguem a tal chave, o cavaleiro a chegar no vulc?o, encontra um sacofago com a cara do vingador e com entrada para a chave.  O vingador chega querendo a chave e tentando evitar que o arqueiro a introdu-za no sarcfago. N?o acreditando no vingador ele abre o tal sarcofago e dela sai uma enorma luz, que cusa um verdadeiro estardalha?o no local, e as poucos va mudando a cara o vingado e de seu cavalo, que aos poucos vai dando lugar a um bondoso cavaleiro.  A partir dai se conta a histria do vingador, que nada mai pe que o filho do mestre do magos, que durante a juventude e o descobrimento de seus pderes decide seguir um outro mago que apreceu no lugar, que o prometer riquezas e poder, esse mago acaba aprisionando a essncia boa do vingador dentro do sarcofago e no vulc?o.    Como prometido a tal sonhado portal aparece, e todos ficam olhando para o parque, mas antes de irem o metre do magos perguta se  aquilo mesmo que querem, ou se n?o preferiam ficar e viver novas aventuras pois aquele mundo precisava deles.    com o esa pergunta o episodia se ENCERRA.    Essa foi a forma que o criadore da srie criou para se houvesse interesse em uma 4a temporada , teria de onde come?ar a historia.    Em varios sites sobre o desnho  possivl encontrar essa entrevista alm do escript do ultimo episdio , que nunca chegou a ser produzido pois o desnho foi cancelado antes pela MARVEL ( A MESMA DO H.ARANHA, X -MEM E OUTROS).|`|2942f553ac80ec2bc1fce20a7f798ebaaa	Naquele dia da roda gigante foi o dia que eles morreram e foram para o inferno e o mestre dos magos  mal igual ao vingador.|`|78fb69ae75b8e5646ed51c9b5df175e2aa	Um funcionrio do parque de divers?o sai a procura de todos para avisar que est na hora do encerramento do expediente e manda todos irem pra casa e diz se eles quiserem voltar no dia seguinte ter?o que pagar mais caro pelos ingressos pois os mesmos desfrutaram de todo o tempo disponvel do expediente do parque, impedindo que outras pessoas pudessem se divertir.|`|5fc852d0db54e3685f064ad32e026093aa	Todos saem deste lugar|`|d070fc1ae59ed1b4afaa427b91769805aa	este  o verdadeiro final da carvena do drag?o.   o seguinte, como todos j sabem os meninos entraram em uma outra dimens?o no parque de divers?es. no ultimo capitulo eles veerm uma saida(um portal) que os levam para seu mundo, quando descobrem que o seu mundo transformou-se naquilo que eles mais temiam.    eles encontram bush presidente, e que eles eram convocados para irem lutar no iraque, e lutar em outros lugares,  eles teriam que matar muita gente inocente,e que  se aliariam a canificidas do mundo todo, agora eles lutariam junto com os monstros e contra as pessoas.           eles teriam que se transformar nos terroristas que os presidentes falavam que estavam conbatendo, mais na verdade eles(presidentes) que s?o os terroristas que gostam de matar homens, mulheres e principalmente crian?as.  ent?o aqueles jovens decidem retornarem ao mundo que eles queriam saiu, pois naquele mundo as lutas eram fantasiosas, e neste as lutas s?o reais.|`|4098f10f9d15c890e57aac2c7c553fb4aa	n?o existe "fim" oficial para a caverna do drag?o... alguns roteiros foram escritos mas nenhum foi realizado... e essa historia de q esse tinham morrido e estavam no inferno eh uma mentira q colocaram na net e se espalhou... o ultimo epsodio gravado mostra o portal de volta para o mundo, mas acaba ai e ninguem sabe se eles entraram ou n?o no portal... os produtores fizeram isso para qnd quiserem voltar a gravar os epsodios n?o fikem sem sentido!  E s lembrando: a Caverna do Drag?o N?O teve fim....|`|874e2b789fc69021f8fffc8fd27e3021aa	Muito bem, vamos ao final verdadeiro e sem anestesia: "Caverna do Drag?o"     "Na ltima aventura aquele drag?o de sete cabe?as (Tiamat) conta a verdade e depois eles a comprovam. O drag?o conta que nunca mais eles voltar?o para a Terra. Nunca porque quando eles estavam descendo naquele carrinho da montanha russa eles n?o entraram em outra dimens?o. O carrinho caiu...e eles morreram. Por isso n?o podem voltar, porque est?o mortos.                      E l  o inferno! Como nenhum deles era bonzinho na vida real, eles foram parar no inferno depois que morreram na queda do carrinho e o dem?nio resolveu brincar com eles. Cruel e sdico, o dem?nio s vezes aparecia de Vingador e s vezes (pasmem!!!) de Mestre dos Magos. Os dois na verdade eram a mesma pessoa: o Dem?nio, sdico, jogando e brincando com os novos moradores do seu imprio! Podem reparar: sempre que estavam conseguindo sair, o Mestre dos Magos aparecia, e dava alguma informa??ozinha e depois? Sumia, e os deixava sem saber o que fazer. Por causa dessa brincadeira, um anjo foi enviado com a miss?o de tentar fazer com que eles descubram a verdade. Porm, ele n?o podia simplesmente entrar no inferno, precisava de um disfarce. E entrou como um drag?o, o Tiamat. Porm aps diversas tentativas, acaba por revelar a verdade, no ltimo episdio. N?o precisa esfor?ar a memria para lembrar quantas vezes eles estavam encurralados pelo Vingador, prontos pra se ferrar, e o drag?o apareceu, para brigar com Vingador, e dando tempo para eles fugirem. Mas o dem?nio tinha um capeta que o auxiliava neste trabalho. Algum que sempre os impedia de voltar (ou seja, descobrir que n?o havia como voltar): Uni, o pequeno unicrnio. Ela era, na verdade, um enviado do dem?nio que os acompanhava todo o tempo para atrapalh-los e brincar com os seus sentimentos. Todo mundo lembra de quantas vezes eles n?o "saram" por causa daquele unicrnio. Quando estavam prontos pra descobrir a verdade, ela ficava para trs e eles voltavam para ajud-la, se afastando novamente da "sada". Nunca mais eles voltar?o e viver?o para sempre naquele Inferno. Essa  a verdade revelada pelo Mestre desse jogo de Dungeons e Dragons oficialmente.|`|d9be939845ea85f9eab281f55d5b01e2aa	a ltima vez que assisti, todos conseguiram voltar atravs de  um portal.

Gary Gyrax, produtor e criador de Caverna do Drag?o,  quem define: "N?o h verdade alguma nisso. Nenhum episdio assim foi produzido. Tiamat n?o  um anjo e nem ajuda de maneira nenhuma". J Mark Evanier, um dos roteiristas da srie,  mais enftico: "Isto  completamente falso! Apesar de vrios finais possveis terem sido discutidos, nenhum ltimo episdio foi realmente produzido". O escritor Michael Reaves, roteirista de oito episdios, completa: "Caverna do Drag?o foi um desenho muito sombrio para sua poca - tanto quanto  Grgulas hoje. Ns o levamos o mais longe possvel para um programa infantil". Apesar de Caverna ter sido um desenho  frente de seu tempo, Reaves diz que n?o haveria chance nenhuma de uma histria deste tipo ter ido ao ar: "Os garotos n?o ficaram presos no inferno, nem o Mestre dos Magos  o dem?nio ou coisa parecida. Essa histria toda  absurda", diz. Mas ent?o, qual  a verdade afinal?    Ao final do terceiro ano da srie, a CBS decidiu colocar no ar um episdio que encerrasse a temporada. Michael Reaves escreveu aquele que pode ser considerado o verdadeiro ltimo captulo da srie: Requiem. "Este episdio foi escrito de forma que tivesse um duplo sentido, ambguo e triunfante: se o desenho n?o continuasse, o final seria satisfatrio; se continuasse, o episdio serviria de trampolim para uma nova dire??o". Reaves finalizou o Script de Requiem em maio de 1985. Para sua surpresa (e a de todos), a srie foi encerrada bruscamente e este roteiro acabou nunca saindo do papel. Gary Gyrax explica o fato: "Em 85, a equipe do desenho se reuniu com os executivos da Marvel e da CBS e foi decidido que a srie continuaria na temporada seguinte. Os seis garotos - mais velhos e experientes - seriam chamados de volta ao mundo da Caverna do Drag?o pelo Mestre dos Magos. Trs scripts do desenho foram feitos e eu at aprovei um deles. Mas algumas dificuldades surgiram. A D&D Corp. fechou e a CBS junto com a Marvel decidiu n?o continuar mais com o desenho. A nova srie acabou cancelada antes mesmo de ser produzida". Caso resolvido e encerrado.|`|348769bff9731644cca803f08c593045aa	puts meu eu assisti o final, cada um dos jovens pega sua poderosa   arma, e vai pra cima do vingador quando o magico pega seu chapeu,  e faiz uma magia e o vingador vira um super baziad?o...  e ae eles fumaram e ficaram na brisa para sempre,,,|`|6c2246494c138d83b7bd5b48ff663fb7aa	N?o sabia, mas criei minha opni?o com as informa??es passadas...valeu genteeeeeeee!!!! ;)|`|bb9dba736d6325baa3679310b54865cdaa	Isso tudo de dizer que eles est?o mortos, que o mestre dos magos  o demonio isso tudo  pura balela, o que simplesmente aconteceu  que os criadores do desenho tiveram um desentendimento e resolveram n?o o fazer mais, por isso ele nao tem fim.|`|707017a98397ea5c121257c552e49c1aaa	S?o muitas as vers?es dadas nesta pgina, mas acho que a vers?o do garoto que disse ter traduzido o ultimo episdio seja l onde ele tenha encontrado faz sentido, pois se o vingador era mesmo filho do mestre dos magos   a certas coisas que um pai n?o pode fazer pelo filho e precisa de ajuda. Achar o mestre dos magos era o diabo  algo que n?o posso imaginar pois assim como na  vida real a verdade sempre vence, cedo ou tarde mais vence e todas as vitria obtidas pelos garotos n?o podem ser fruto do mal. Mestre dos magos assim como DEUS nunca influenciou quanto ao livre arbtrio dos jovens, apenas lhes mostrou o caminho.  muito dificio algum como mestre dos magos ser mal.   quanto ao TIAMAT, assim como qualquer animal s se defendia n?o podemos dizer que um animal selvagem  bom ou mal, ele apenas tenta se manter vivo.|`|18c83a176be5bfa3d8ed6030442d8369aa	-Fiquei sabendo que no final eles descobrem que est?o todos mortos.  -Outro final era que o Mestre dos Magos na verdade era o Vingador e os impedia de sair.|`|d646224d5ce6540d6474d3c942039314aa	Eu j ouvi diversas histrias a respeito.

Aps tomarem conscincia deste fato terrvel, enfrentam o mestre dos magos(vingador) em uma luta sem igual mas, infelizmente, todos s?o derrotados e sacrificados em um ritual que o prprio vingador realiza para aumentar seus poderes. Aps tantos anos de reinado, vingador ter que conduzir novos jovens para este mundo cruel para dar procedncia aos seus planos de conquista.  E assim termina esta histria.

Most frozen turkeys available in the market are not only virgins, but males(toms), who have been fed specific growth hormones to make them grow bigger, faster, with larger breasts.

Next time, either be sure to ask if it is free range, wild, etc. or what kind of (commercial) bird it is and you should be able to get an idea of how it was raised..  To avoid feeling guilty, disgusted, or betrayed in the future, either raise or purchase, and prepare your own bird for the holidays.
ApEkhjcDaa	The Lion is considered the king of the jungle, and likewise you Leos have an air of royalty about you. Some Leos even have hair resembling the thick mane of the Lion. But Lions are more than roar, for they are truly magnificent beasts. The Lioness proudly cares for the young, hunts and takes care of survival with relentless intent and ferocity, when needed. And proud are you Leo! Perhaps that's why Leo often chooses work that puts you in the center of stage or in the spotlight of appreciation.     Leo are warm of spirit, eager for action and are driven by a desire to be loved for what you bring to others. Leo are a magnanimous leader and a faithful servant. Once scorned in love, however, Leo will withdraw your affections and the light, once brilliant, can go cold.     Leo motto might be "What you see is what you get." You tend to live your live straightforwardly and with a flair for drama. In fact, many Leos are attracted to the theater, the performing arts and public relations, for you truly understand the importance of putting on a good presentation. As you blaze gloriously through your life, remember to take time to acknowledge the feelings of those around you. If you forget, you could unconsciously hurt someone you love. But, if you remain aware your impact, others can benefit from your presence.     Element: Fire  Fire signs are naturally warm. A fire gives light and heat, but it doesn't get depleted as others feed on its warmth. One candle can bring light to a room and it won't burn any faster if ten people read from its light than if there was only one. Fire doesn't plan it next move; it isn't logical. It simply is in the moment and will burn what fuel is available without judgment or forethought. For this reason fire signs can successfully rely on their intuition and survival instincts.     The fire of Leo is brilliant and intense. It's like the summer Sun that relentlessly shows up every day and whose heat continues to build over a period of time.     Fifth House: Children  The Fifth House is directly related to children, but it is also associated with any type of childlike activity. Even grown-ups need to play and this is a function of the Fifth House. In fact, all self-expression and creativity comes from this sector. Additionally, this is the House of Romantic Love. Truly, the Fifth House could be called the House of Enjoyment.     Key Planet: Sun  The Sun is the undisputed King of our little planetary system. He is always in the center. Without his light, there would be no life here on earth. Although the Sun is 93 million miles distant, its warmth is the basis for all energy on Earth. Astrologically, the Sun represents our will. It's like the fuel that fires each of our individual furnaces and gives us cause to live. As the key planet of Leo, the Sun is the symbol of the self and from it stems all individuality and creativity.     Leo Greatest Strength: Your playful and loving nature|`|Ru3Y8Mhdaa	They only think about themselves.  They are bossy, dominant, they love to tell people what to do, but they don't like to follow other people's rules, they think they're smarter than everyone, they talk over people in conversation, very arrogant, never admit when they are wrong, the only good thing I will say about them as that they are generous when it comes to giving.|`|8NFLpbJAaa	I'm a leo :D|`|f07fdb6bf714c125a917a88568499157aa	Know all about leo and your horoscope for the year 2009-2010  http://www.freeehoroscope.com|`|g1A4s6qqaa	I hate leos. They're the suckest horoscope.|`|8sMr9Vmtaa	Leo, the Lion, is the astrology sign for July 23 to August 22. The sun rules this sign under the element of fire. This type of personality is the most domineering of all the signs of the Zodiac. Some of the personality traits associated with Leo are:      Ambitious    Courageous    Dominant    Strong-willed    Positive    Independent    Self-confident    They make really great leaders because they have a positive outlook on things that commands respect from those serving under them. They know exactly what they want and they go after it, thriving on complicated circumstances.    The faults also run to the same extremes and a negative Leo is one of the most obnoxious people you ever could meet. Such a person is haughty and arrogant, with an excessive temper. They love flattery and tend to boast of their accomplishments even if it means putting others down. They have a passion for luxury and an emotional indulgence. Fortunately, most people under this sign can temper the negative qualities of their personality so that they are likeable people.    In any profession, Leo likes to be at the top. They dislike manual labor, preferring to be the boss who gives orders to others. They have exceptional organizational skills, which make them well-suited for top ranking positions in government or business. In relationships, they tend to be genuine, caring and loving. They are outgoing and kind, but tend to be more hurt than usual when they are let down. They do have a strong sex drive and often find it hard to stay true to one person, leading to marriage failures. They dislike doing things safely and penny pinching, which often leads them into financial difficulties.    In matters of health, those under the sign of Leo tend to suffer from ailments of the back, lungs and spine, as well as heart and blood conditions.|`|ih2uVmJNaa	i found out more information about leo did you ? http://www.autopilotmachine.com/leo

I'm a gemini by the way. When we first met, he looked into my eyes and spoke to me. I was sometimes uncomfortable with it and usually looked away like I was interested in something nearby but kept talking. Then, one day, he told me, with annoyed look on his face :P, why I was not looking at him when i was speaking :D. Then I said something like I was a bit shy and .... Now we are going out for almost a year and he still kept doing it.  Usually, I'm the talker. He just sits ther and stares at me but affectionately. I'm not sure if he is even listening to me but just let me talk so that I'd be happy? One thing I'm sure is scorpio men are caring and loving. They are really hot too.

79b7acc891b16ac8e9ba82e8ee5b22acaa	Em um dia de ver?o, estava na praia, observando duas crian?as brincando na areia.

Compreendi que havia aprendido uma grande li??o:   Ganhamos muito tempo da nossa vida construindo alguma coisa e mais cedo ou mais tarde, uma onda podera vir e destruir tudo o que levamos tanto tempo para construir.Mas quando isso acontecer somente aquele que tem as maos de alguem para segurar, sera capaz de sorrir!

bc2f9034a51968f2b5ca5dec19dc698caa	Can we really rank forms of hatred and oppression by calling one "better" than another? Aren't they BOTH bad?    **Well, racism in America has changed forms, so it's not so blatant, but I don't know if it's really gotten so much better. Education, expectations, and treatment of black and Hispanics is still terrible! Some people think the fact that racism is hidden is worse, because it can be difficult to prove that it was racism after it happens. It sort of occurs and then disappears, although thorough research does reveal the truth (but less people are studying it because they pretend it's gone).    I have to admit I'm not SO knowledgeable about modern Secretarianism in the UK, but I do know that Britain has a LOT of social issues (like Chavs). I have British friends, and it seems that the British government is really failing the people in many ways...|`|leDGyCW1aa	Both are terrible, neither are confined to the US or GB & I, are global problems.|`|9CYpX1J8aa	both terrible|`|QAwwmDuDaa	They are both around the same,hate is hate where ever you are.|`|xAfY4R7Caa	or.|`|PneYU3vNaa	50/50.|`|iJ3BeFWxaa	50-50|`|caea98f7ed2871cd6caf9a1f351fc5ddaa	i think they're both as bad as each other|`|TYl7kmPeaa	i think they are both equally bad  because they both are hating something about another group  and its ridiculous  people need to wake up and face it that people are different and people will always be different  get over the stupid little things that make people hate others  this subject makes me so mad... i just cant believe how people can treat fellow humans... their peers.. just because of a minor difference
e9eed448c77e100280e4c3add6929ab2aa	Na minha opini?o, s?o poucos os programas de TV que podem ser considerados " bons" . Na TV aberta, alguns programas da TV Cultura s?o bons, de carter educativo e instrutivo. Tambm existem os programas jornalsticos, ( desde que n?o sejam sensacionalistas) das TVs Globo, Record, Bandeirantes, RedeTv e SBT. Tambm tem programa??o de qualidade os canais Discovery Channel e National Geography. No canal Futura tambm h bons programas.  Infelizmente, nossa tv aberta ( aquela que  vista por mais de 90% da popula??o), est tomada por programas de qualidade duvidosa, para n?o dizer de pssima qualidade, como Gugu, Faust?o, Gilberto Barros, Superpop, Panico, Ratinho, novelas, etc...Mas fazer o que, se h gosto para tudo...|`|114a38bba9ed4606e3c5b12e4d2bcd47aa	 o programa sobre nova dire??o com a heloisa perise e a ingrid guimaraes.|`|383afb1fdcd3b433ad3c07f6b34b9412aa	Para mim Casseta e Planeta.|`|f7fca6e5e07ec2ce9d88f73d4b329167aa	panico na tv|`|031fa2a624469f4194e5aeb5a768861faa	Qualquer um do Discovery Chanell.|`|787f050517741f30070d0ae35465b2b2aa	Lost|`|cd5787d2a62fa7eecf73c19a80cbe01daa	Milton Neves, ao meio dia na Record.  para ser programa esportivo,mas  um programa de entretendimento.|`|8a9e694972cf0f356f5a90c3d569b5c9aa	No momento eu n?o acho nenhum!

d3e35dd9b67f4c61ff3ba906c337697aaa	The .bin is a cd image file, used by cd burners.  You need to download an extractor to put the video into a useable format so that you can watch it.    Praetor from afterdawn.com says it much better than I could, so I copied and pasted from their website:    If you want to extract files from a cd-image there are several solutions. (1) Download a free virtual drive called Daemon Tools from http://www.cd-rw.org/software/cdr_softwa... and mount the image. You can then have access to the files as if it was on a CD. (2) Using a free program called CDMage (obtained from http://cdmage.orcon.net.nz/frames.html ), , first open the image using CDMage (or drag-n-drop). Note that you have to correctly select the input parameters in order to open it (trial and error will suffice). Once the image is opened, goto the file(s) you want to extract, right click and select 'Extract Files...' provide the destination you want to extract to and whatever settings you desire and click 'Extract' . You may have to check the "Keep Broken Files" checkbox. (3) Using either WinISO or UltraISO (since they use the same basic interface), first open (or drag-and-drop) a supported CD Image with WinISO, select the file(s) you wish to extract, right click, select "Extract" and specify a destination and extract away. You can obtain WinISO and UltraISO from http://www.winiso.com/ and http://www.ezbsystems.com/enindex.html respectively (4) Using ISOBuster, first open the image (or drag-n-drop). Then select the file(s), right-click and select either "Extract " or "Extract Objects". Specify the destination you want to extract to and click OK/Save. (You can get ISOBUster from http://www.cd-rw.org/software/cdr_softwa...

Essa pergunta n?o  a mais difcil de se responder, creio que a idade n?o vai fazer diferen?a, se voc vai se dar bem com uma pessoa mais velha n?o sou eu que vou responder pra voc, nem o horscopo, nem ningum pode responder isso pra voc.   Deus te deu o livre arbtrio, se voc conhece o cara, gosta dele e sabe que ele ser um bom marido pra voc, n?o vejo problema algum de vocs ficarem juntos.  Mas, posso dar uma dica pra voc, pergunte e voc mesma qual o tipo de cara que voc quer, macho ou machista.  O machista  o que a sua vida n?o vai andar pra frente, aquele que voc vai vestir uma roupa, sei l "ROSA"  e ele vai dizer "mulher minha n?o usa roupa rosa", voc entendeu? Um OGRO!  Mas o macho de verdade  aquele que sabe tomar decis?es, que sabe ser o cabe?a da casa, que n?o ouve o que os outros dizem pra tomar as decis?es da sua casa, a n?o ser a sua opini?o e a de DEUS.  Pergunte pra DEUS tambm se esse  o marido que ele preparou pra voc; voc sabia que ele tem uma pessoa especialmente pra voc, do jeito que voc gosta e quer?  Ent?o pergunte a DEUS assim.  DEUS, esse  o marido que o SENHOR preparou pra mim?     isso ai, DEUS  te aben?oe e te ilumine e espere a resposta dele.|`|3a43ded1b6f8a6b0f6f0309a3dcfd1d1aa	Com amor tudo d certo.  o que importa!!!|`|5b2d861a33dbbbdcd6ea8488b5b19a40aa	Pra saber se d certo, a numerologia precisa dos nomes completos.

W33oDgkxaa	ma puffati i fatti tuoi..non penso che tutti puffano con puffetta, oppure che si puffano tra di loro..secondo me so ermafroditi e si autopuffano..=D|`|vArVe4uEaa	hahaha!!! secondo me sono gay........ per quelli normali puffetta si sprecher di +!|`|89ElidgJaa	In realt, Puffetta credo sia un travestito...non ha un briciolo di seno!!!!Per il fatto che tutti i puffi maschi le stiano intorno(compreso quel gran pedofilo del grande Puffo) sbavando come cani con la rabbia, inizia a preoccuparmi..._  Credo che in passato, i puffi fossero tutti gay(essendo solo maschi, dovevano campare) poi Puffetta ha avuto la grande idea di mettersi del fieno sulla testa e farsi scambiare per una femmina...E a quel punto...u_u   Beh, ci sono ancora molti segreti e misteri non risolti dietro alla lunga serie dei Puffi...Chiss se un giorno l'uomo riuscir a trovare delle risposte...|`|K9frFja7aa	pi che altro come se riproducono? x mitosi? perch con tutta la buona volont puffetta non pu avere partorito tutti quei figli con la linea che ha!!!!!!!!!!|`|ReDTb1n2aa	E perch non ti 6 mai chiesto da dove siano nati tutti i puffi??Da Grande Puffo e da chi??Secondo me li ha generati da solo..I puffi sono ermafroditi, questa  la crudele verit...kissss|`|XhgFtUGjaa	Ad una domanda del genere dovrei risponedere con ironia  ...  ma ho una teoria e ti risponder seriamente  all'inizio i puffi sen ben ricordi erano tutti maschi...  puffetta  stata creata da Gargamella ...  Quindi in teoria non dovrebbero riprodursi in maniera convenzionale...  Inlotre puffetta  stata creata con un incantesimo  Quindi i puffi credo siano stati creati a loro volta in questa maniera...  La vera domanda : ma se Gargamella  in grado di creare i puffi (vedi puffetta) perch passa il suo tempo a cercare di prenderli? Che se li faccia da se....no?    I puffi piccini delle serie successive sono stati creati per questione di marketing  ma cmq suppongo sempre per via di qualceh incantesimo strano XD    Ho risolto qualche tuo dubbio?    Baci|`|RnJROYihaa	si|`|cI1zegDPaa	credo che ai puffi nn interessi il sesso...|`|uYOHlKXYaa	la seconda ipotesi direi|`|OkahLJ3oaa	nessuno dei due.. i puffi sn i puffi....|`|TOwIEjDGaa	sono gay    se ci fai cosa nessuno ci prova con lei, e lei se la tira a morire|`|gMkGjPR0aa	puffetta  una grandissima battitrice di strade se vai a roma per la prenestina la incontri sempre|`|nF1Uq2R7aa	i puffi sn gay  e puffetta era un puffo prima...|`|Juv8LSrqaa	Io invece credo che l' ideatore del cartone siano un regista di film porno... Sai nei Puffi, ci sono certe scene in cui lo si fa in gruppo!  Puffetta in realt  un trans...|`|XCxH6Fh6aa	Puffetta  un trans|`|9TEzdzmxaa	Me lo sono chiesta anche io. So solo che puffetta  una creazione di Gargamella, quindi penso che tutti i puffi avrebbero dovuto ringraziarlo per questo!|`|omrfay1Saa	NO  SOLO CHE UN PUFFO ENTRA IN CALORE UNA VOLTA NELLA VITA... E QUELLA VOLTA NON C'E SEMPRE PUFFETTA DISPONIBILE...  DICIAMO CHE I PUFFI NASCONO DAI FUNGHI....|`|EfaVi60Oaa	per chi non lo sapesse... purtroppo i puffi non hanno fantasie sessuali... non si riproducono e le puffette nascono ogni 300 anni o qualcosa del genere...tranne puffetta e bontina che sono state create da Gargamella enel cartone c' anche nonna puffa...in una puntata precisamente in quella in cui arriva Baby Puffo si spiega da dove nascono...Nascono dalle stelle cadute sulla terra...|`|ClbxUzhLaa	bh puffo vanitoso lo era di sicuro    io pensavo che fosse una ragazza pensa te    ma credo che la puffetta si dia da fare    con una bella casetta per appuntamenti    ahahahahaha    ma la maggior parte  gay prima che arrivasse la puffetta secondo te che facevono     la tv nn esiste    cantare e ballere tutto il giorno nn si pu    perci il tempo lo passavono in quel modo    ahaahaa    ciao      ___________________    vedi mi danno retta su internet    guarda che ho trovato    Puffetta  la sgualdrina ufficiale dei puffi.  [modifica] Biografia     la classica topolona che tutti si farebbero, se solo non fosse alta due mele o poco pi. A proposito di mele, ha due pere enormi che usa trastullarsi con la spazzola per i capelli.    Creata da Gargamella da un tozzo di sterco, viene programmata per trarre in trappola i Puffi maledetti tramite un tranello sessuale, offre infatti ad ognuno il proprio corpo gratuitamente se promettono di seguirla. Ma il suo piano viene smascherato da quel gay di Puffo Vanitoso che non infilerebbe il suo piccolo pene in una puffovagina neanche a pagarlo in oro massiccio. La piccola bagascia, stuprata da tutti gli animaletti della foresta oltre che da Grande Puffo, finisce per diventare una puffa a tutti gli effetti e resta con il gruppo di piccoli bastardi (ormai plagiata da loro fino al midollo).  [modifica] Carriera    Nel 1980 tenta la carriera televisiva conducendo il suo primo programma con il falso nome di Raffaella Carr. Da subito riscuote un enorme successo, specialmente in Venezuela dove si arricchisce come strozzina, promettendo soprattutto viaggi in Italia ai morti di fame di l.    Sembra che in futuro sia stata contattata per condurre un programma televisivo, ma il suo ufficio stampa  in sciopero quindi non si sa quasi nulla.     ahahahahaaha|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	e bontina te la sei dimenticata?|`|EbtqFy5Waa	Probabilmente molti di loro hanno raggiunto la pace dei sensi.........|`|kdP1pgYwaa	Quindi  tro.ia solamente perch  l'unica femmina!!Io non ho visto mai puffetta mettersi con qualcuno...semmai la prima opzione vale di pi,,,si ammettiamolo i puffi son tutti gay!|`|aoQppGSQaa	a dire il vero nn ho mai trovato 1 risposta a questa domanda...  chiss che hanno nel cervello sti puffi..|`|qBelF14laa	I Puffi sono asessuati non sono gay.... Puffetta o altri esemplari femminili non esistono nella razza dei Puffi... ricordiamo che Puffetta l'ha creata Gargamellla|`|65i4V92Daa	forse sono un p gay|`|tC14lueRaa	non era l'unica femmina c'era anche una puffettina con treccine......gay era vanitoso..........

bdfk2d49aa	Pisces is just your Sun Sign. To get a better understanding, you gotta look at your complete birth chart.    Fill this up: http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/a...|`|f63f9f351cf19e94cff59963c9708a3daa	i'm a pisces moon and i hate it...i like all the good things about it, but all the other crap about being clingy and gullible just gets me mad....one, becsue for me its true, second, becasue i dont want to be dependant on people and be stupidly unrealistic...    anyways, go have a look at your moon sign...it shows you who you truly are...your sun might be psices, but your moon might be virgo or maybe even aquarius , you never know =D...i'm a scoprio sun pisces moon and the emotions and crap are getting hard to deal with...    you dont sound too much like a pisces..so i'm thinking somwehere in your chart there are planets that are more like fire or air signs...and  i think they're stronger than your sun in psices..so i wouldnt worry too much about it...|`|QgnVXJnoaa	I think you need to check out your chart. You may have just a couple thing Pisces..or even not that many water signs. Thats probably why you dont feel that you 'click' with the pisces definition..|`|B7WIZdglaa	you might have an aquarius moon or mercury! Check it out ;)    http://www.0800-horoscope.com/birthchart...|`|lRKFCUOqaa	The Horoscope Junkie has prophecies for the passionate in planetary prediction.   http://www.horoscope-junkie.com    Free Yearly Horoscope for Pisces  http://www.psychic-junkie.com/free-yearl...|`|F32mOSMEaa	its hard being something because you haven't found the good in it.  i was tired of being an aquarius, but then i found out im the most unique and one of a kind sign in the zodiac that does things differently.  i have heard that pisces have good facial features that set them apart,  so why not enjoy your physical appearance like every one does and don't really get led by this astrology mess, its nonsense but it can become consuming.|`|BQn9bfOraa	I am a Pisces too, but i don't feel like it.   I found out i have a Leo moon and other fire and earth signs in my chart. Since my moon is a fire sign it overpowers my water influence.    My friend is an Aquarius and you wouldn't really know half of the time because she has her moon in Cancer (the ruler of the moon).     She is a lot more sensitive that i could ever be, but she is still cool.    I am also at times very aloof and distant as well (Aquarius) typical traits.    My Aquarius suppressed his emotions then went off about things that didn't need that much drama. I came to find out that his moon sign is in (Gemini)    I have a guy friend that is also an Gemini and it was just weird he would turn to the club or bottle if he felt he had issues.     I find Gemini men (moon or sun) double speak as well.    So an Aquarius isn't that aloof and distant they just do it in spitefulness while emotions are killing them deep down (once again it depends on the (moon) combination     So no two Aquarius or Pisces or Gemini are alike, but they may have similar traits with somethings.      Pisces aren't weak they just don't suppress emotions, Other signs should learn from that.    lol ok that is my post on the issue.
bXL9937haa	I've got tons of planets in the 8th house. However, mars is in the 7th and a moon in the 9th. Whew! All that I can say is that the 8th house usually has something to do with insurance, other people's money, the occult, research, inheritance, money from real estate, sex, etc. Hope that I've helped! Interested to see comments on this question.    Sun: Virgo (8th house)  Moon: Libra (9th house)  Venus: Virgo (8th house)  Mercury: Leo (8th house)  Mars: Cancer (7th house)  Jupiter: Leo (8th house)  Saturn: Virgo (8th house)    * With Mars in the 8th house you are likely to exert your energy and initiative into the quest for personal success, self-knowledge and emotional security. Your energy is channelled through powerful, deep-seated but easily aroused emotions and a powerful sex-drive. There is a desire for leadership within your social and business environment. Maybe involvement with metaphysical or occult groups is a possibility. Your deep interest in finance, big business and a keen, positive attitude to investment ensures success. People that have mars in Virgo in the 8th possess an intuitive sense that is well tuned when it comes to assessing prospective partners and financial opportunities.|`|m1V5ws73aa	It means you're an idiot who thinks stars will affect your life.
elVDYy7eaa	Your specific horoscope characteristics should indicate to you what your date of birth is - you don't need to know it, consult a professional astrologer. Astrology is so accurate a science that they will be able to pinpoint your date of birth with astonishing precision. I'm not pulling your leg! Promise! Would I lie to you?|`|Aeh5i5Lhaa	You should check your Certificate of Birth.|`|bFf6Fb5daa	maybe the hospital you were born in.|`|65798b01815336774276b167183ee126aa	You might try the Hall of Records in the city or county you were born in;  You should be able to get a copy of your birth certificate. there.

Can you go on?   Kristy are you doing okay?   A rose that won't bloom  Winter's kept you  Don't waste your whole life trying  To get back what was taken away    Though the marks on your dress  Had been neatly repressed  I knew that something was wrong  And I should have spoke out  And I'm so sorry now  I didn't know  Cause we were so young    Oh, clouds of time  Seem to rain on  Innocence left behind  And it never goes away|`|68ZN14lpaa	the name of the song is Kristy, are you doing okay? by the Offspring. at least I hope that;s the song you're talking about?|`|o2WMzU2baa	midomi.com

QnVypDNQaa	its actually songmeanings.net|`|c7ZwZllZaa	Check out the website www.songmeanings.com, you can search pretty much any song and people comment on what they think its about.
c7ZwZllZaa	If you're writing a song you should figure out what you're writing about first. The easiest stuff to write about is usually life troubles. Pick up a pen and paper and start scribbling down ideas. Creativity isn't something that can be pushed, you have to be inspired. Figure out what inspires you and start writing.|`|c1379040fcc5c4a581798d49a39f2446aa	tell me what it is you got ?   and do you expect more from those?    and when your dimmwitted enough to ask   does it make me smart   and then know that you are clever enough the exact an answer  look inside,  look outside   or just lie and paint as you see it   or painfully pretend that you have  something to offer  dont forget to make it soulful     remember to include me   as i am all i see        dull,,  been done?   try to see a chance of the lonely that there is a chance    maybe iiifff   you pend  or spend this time writing you might find a point or at the very least a place in-between of trying and getting done|`|x3zRGKhMaa	How I got started to write a song was I thought about someone that I was in love with and talked about them.  Here's an example:  Baby, I just love you  Baby, You really need me...  Stuff like that. Your song usually starts w/ an intro and then Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Chorus and Verse 3. Your chorus is something that repeats over over again. Good Luck!|`|oUTKodLPaa	let say your writing about love. here's a start maybe:    when you hold me,   i feel like im on top of the world  when you hold me   i feel like screaming   you're the one for me  and everyday  look into your eyes and realize how lucky i came to be

dKhA1ldVaa	She has made up her mind that she is in love, but she won't tell anyone, because she hasn't told the person she's in love with yet and that's what she has to do or she won't end up with them. Then, she wonders if she should give up on them or keep chasing them even if it leads nowhere. She wonders if it would be a waste to tell them or if she should leave it like it is. She is sbout to tell them she loves them, but then she gets nervous and wonders if it is finally it.|`|0aa3dcce6d820b8604d8f72bbb1de485aa	i think shes wondering if she should chase dreams or anything important even if she knows that it wont happen|`|AmW2nqtpaa	It's about a girl who is thinking about getting into a relationship that she knows deep down won't work.    The term"chasing pavements" simply means that someone is pursuing something that they know will never happen. (like when you're running on a sidewalk. You'll most likely never find the end of it. But if you do, it might "lead nowhere.")
lpyWVR2oaa	Pluto conjunct Ascendant in Leo is a very powerful placement as Pluto is also the ruling planet of Scorpio, another fixed sign. This combo bestows a lot of dogged determination in you. Once you set your eyes on something or someone, it's not easy for you to veer off-course. There also seems to be a seething intensity about you where emotions are concerned and although Leo gives off a regal charming aura, it is not easy to penetrate the exterior of your facade as you tend to keep your emotions very well hidden from the prying eyes of others.     Mars trine Ascendant shows that your energies and initiation are well directed and generally support your goals in life. In general, this is a favorable aspect that helps you to conserve physical energy when needed and propel you to achieve your goals in general when you feel the urge to pursue what you want in life.

LNx2Xwy9aa	Hey!  Just give your friend a little space until he comes back to you.     He probably just feels a bit vulnerable because you know so much about him - but before you go let him know that you would hate to lose him as a friend!     Besides being a Pisces myself, I have felt the same way before so I know this, and if I were to dump a friend it would have to be from a betrayal - by then it is truly over.    So in comparison this is nothing to worry about.     Best wishes!|`|1bkiNiwzaa	Pisces needs LOTS and LOTS of space.  It's his problem, not yours.  He will probably not be pals with you again or at least for a very long time.  And then too he will keep his distance from you.  But only because Pisces cant get too close to people.|`|to6JW3yFaa	Yes... but not with ur type of situation.    Normally, I drop a friend or stop talking to them for good if they break my trust in them or do something really huge to betray me. Otherwise I would never do something like that. I wouldnt drop a friend because they're getting too close to me. That sounds a little... odd. Maybe ur friend just has real issues or something? I dont know if this really has to do with astrology. Weird...|`|AA11245447	I don't.  Sorry to hear about this, though.    Can you give him a bit of space and then talk to him again?    Good luck, hon|`|Vpk1nP7gaa	What a stupid Pisces friend you had?|`|1PdUecpYaa	my bestfriend from highschool is a pisces too and one day when she had some personal issues, she sort of blocked everyone out and i didn't see her until 3 years later. and now we're friends again. but i still hate to think she had to get rid of me for that long...   i'm a pisces too....|`|esLaHM0Oaa	"Friends" can only call eachother friends if everything in the friendship is mutual. It all has to be fair game, almost like a two-way street, one side goes one way and the other side comes from the other way. No - in between. If your Pisces friend felt that it was unfair in any way, then I can see it from his point, cos I feel the same way about friendships. If they don't put in as much as I do, then I cut all ties. Cos why should I share everything while they stay close-lipped? And why should I be the giving and not get anything in return back. We may be selfless but we know when to draw the line, too - U know? So, if you value his friendship, then value you him as a person with feelings too. Cos we make great friends once we know we can trust you with our all. And friendship like these are hard to find but it's what we look for, nothing less. We need trust, a great deal of it and loyalty. If we don't see it then for us, it speaks VOLUMES.    Hope I helped.   )-(

ioZeveazaa	I am the opposite way with my husband. He is the Virgo and I, the Cancer. I can tell you though that more likely than not , this is a great match. Cancers are pretty emotional but Virgo is very understanding of this and can help Cancer feel safe and loved. Cancer loves to know that the person they are with loves them and wants to know it. Virgo is usually pretty good at showing their love for their partner. The only thing you need to watch out for is the jealousy factor on both the Cancerian and Virgo signs. They are both jealous signs but as long as the two show their interest in only one another then there shouldn't be a problem. If however either sign feel something is wrong and the other is being unfaithful or keeping a secret, the best thing you can do is come out and say it. Cancer will not be happy if you do something extreme like cheating and will likely want to leave. Cancers are very sensitive to "cheating" and even flirting is usually cheating to us. We are VERY loyal to the one we love and expect that in return so if you are a loyal virgo then you two will do great. Again though if you two do get in a big arguement over something , both will remember and hold some sort of grudge which can be hard on the relationship if it doesn't end it. However Cancer and Virgo are mostly a good match because they understand each other's feelings. Good luck!!|`|XJTynEaMaa	Know about your relationship from the link below

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	The thing you have to remember about Rotten Tomatoes is the tomatometer rating is strictly a percentage of positive reviews. It does not take into consideration whether the it was a 7/10 or a 10/10.     For that reason, a movie like Back to the Future can get a better rating just because more critics found it entertaining. But I bet if you asked every one of those critics who liked Dark Knight and Back to the Future, they would say they liked Dark Knight better.     I really think they should use a better system where participating critics actually give each movie a numerical score. That way a film that was just entertaining might have a 70% while a film that was excellent might be closer to 100%.|`|sgmv6AXnaa	duud gtta appriciate the special effects nd stuff da movie was made in 1985 :P|`|P7mYy4CFaa	Back to the future is basically about how you could change your life if you had the chance,,,or also how it is what it is... Back to the Future is one of the best movies ever to just say, your in control of your own destiny..rock it Bay!1|`|2QuGuphYaa	BTTF is better.    YOU FAIL.|`|4g5Hu1U7aa	First of all, I don't know how old you are, but that may be a big factor in your thinking  BTTF isn't that great.  In 20 years there's gonna be another superhero, better than Dark Knight, and someone's gonna say "What's so great about the Dark Knight?" and you're gonna have to explain it to them.       2nd- From a writing perspective, the plot development in BTTF is tight. What I mean is every single scene moves the plot forward.  Nothing is wasted... The very opening for example, you already see Doc's plutonium and hear about the Libyan's on the news before you even see Marty's face.      3rd- It IS a great story, the basic story idea was "What if you could meet your parents when they were in high school?"  That's wacky.      4th- the acting, Christopher Lloyd as Doc, perhaps the funniest damn thing you'll ever see.      5th- 1.21 gigawatts       6th- deep morals, what deep morals are in The Dark Knight? Beat the bad guy, root for the good guy?  But there are a lot of issues dealing with fate in BTTF, "the future isn't written yet"  that whole thing... it's uplifting and cheesy, yes, but still inspiring.      7th -  Huey Lewis and the News (The Power of Love)    8th- Have you seen the whole trilogy?  that may help    9th- Marty McFly, a white kid from the suburbs invents Rock & Roll... ridiculously unbelievable    10th- I LIKED IT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER...SO BACK OFF!!|`|OzfprFaWaa	Although Back to the Future was a good trilogy, ROTTEN TOMATOES is just a positive scoring.  They were NOT comparing it to other movies.  They were just asking whether you liked it or not and what you would give it out of a 10 rating.  And also..... keep in mind that THAT score would have been accumulated a long time before Dark Knight and other movies came out.|`|jvfpF9feaa	dude its a good movie in my opinion as well as the websites.  it may not be deep movie but neither is the dark knight...though it did kick ***|`|oOSNI3wbaa	they're both great movies. if you're looking for "deep morals" in a movie then you're going to be watching a very short list of films. just enjoy them for what they are.

WGzb3Fhaaa	It actually isn't an insult. And as you think no one here is actually worried about the movie being an insult. Very few people are actually taking the movie too seriously here in India, for them it is just a movie, and many more people do not know about the movie itself.     Actually the Slum exists and everyone knows that, and in India poverty lies and we agree that. Many people live in villages and not in slums. 50% in villages. 30% in cities. 15 % in towns and less than 5% in slums. The living conditions in villages and cities is good, but in slum they are very bad.    Bollywood movies are not as you think, here in India we get some Bollywood movies which show Slum and suffering more better than any Hollywood film has done. But these movies do not actually get as much publicity as Slumdog Millionaire gets. I agree that Bollywood is half useless, but the other half is just opening up and has great ideas.    And many people who have actually seen the movie have appreciated it, and agreed and acknowledge the conditions they have shown as true. The people who think it is an insult are the people who get money from Political Organizations to do a strike.    And actually the film is a book written by an Indian, Vikas Swarup, the book is called as "Q & A", Danny Boyle just made a film based on the book.|`|ybtOvNs7aa	do you call reality as an insult  i dont think there is any insult, we shud feel proud for the achievements for this film... jealous bollywood ppl will call it insult coz it has been made by outsiders not them.|`|8wHg5MECaa	Dog is really insulting.

It's not a reality...  U already know...  India is not like that as shown im movie...  and about insult...    Western people are not going to come india to see whether the india is like that or not... we easily believe in things which are shown to us in a form of movies...  And its again a smash hit!!!  Indians knw what india is...  India is poor but that... as shown...  The scenes shown are very very less...    If you want to see that... you have to travel a lot... that you can only see at mumbai...  or else u r not going to get...  so... indians r going to consider it as insult...  i also think that...  movie need that seens... but india is huge and contain many things...     I respect india...  in short...  it's just a drop of water in ocean...    thank u...|`|PRJfZAWBaa	Insult is a bit too harsh a word, but yes, many people might be feeling offended because the film has become a grand success all over for portraying the poor India.   This way, India is unfortunately being publicized as a poor country with fanatics who would jump in sh*t to get an autograph of Amitabh Bacchhan, where slum dwellers are nothing but a piece of shame to us.    Yes, in some way, the truth has been revealed in the film and slum life very well exists in India. No question about that. But, the thing is, the movie doesn't deserve so much success and recognition. And surprisingly, only such films which show the poverty, the problems of India are well acclaimed in the West.|`|I13rHn1Waa	hmmmm.....well, i donot consider it as an insult.....  But the problem in movie was that only slum life was shown, which depicted only sufference....|`|XQ1ZBfMGaa	The people who were insulted were from the Slums !    As they are named 'Dogs'.

Well actually "Insult" is really a big word...But U know the people who have made these remarks....  believe they r Proud Indians.. They think that it's great as long as someone shows the glorious side of our Mahan Bharat  in a movie... or through anything else...Actually they think in a way that most of the politicians of today think....  But it's actually a shame to think like that...THey dont understand that there is no glory to show only the bright side...  India is not made of Financially Mid-class and High-class people...It's actually made of the Peasants and all those other  communities who get paid many times lower considering the hard work they put in... and this movie depicts this bare truth  which these so called "Proud Indians" can't bear to watch...All they say is It's a movie from the perspective of a British...  and that it's from the same people who ruled our land once...and God knows what else they say...IT"S REALLY BULL-****!  It's really an eye-opening concept...And I hope god give those people some intelligence to think over it again from the scratch!!|`|w6TgTrGbaa	Yeah its a eye openerand a  beautiful question  it is not an insult for developing country like ours    But when an outlander comes and criticises our country  its hard for every one of us to accept or appreciate his guts for narrating a slum dog's(how can one call people in slums as a dog) story    More over its not an indian film and only a film about india    It also has scenes highlighting US while comparing it wit india    if ur satisfied pls  vote this as the best answer|`|DGHatVsZaa	Coz it shows people who live in slums as beggars and prostitutes .....  U might think it is true, but the people in slums are really hard working, their kids go to school, and they stay there only coz other houses are damn expensive in such centre places in the heart of the city... that's the REALITY, if u think that a guy would jump into **** to see a hero is real, that's ur mistake...    the movie is an insult to the hard-working people who stay in slums|`|AA12264002	Well, It's not realistic. It's not the FULL truth of what's happening in here.What do people in western countries know about India to think that SM portrays truth anyways?? Only 24% of population in India is living below Poverty Line & most of them are in rural areas.  What SM did is degrade  "Rising India" for the sake of happiness/ Satisfaction of Westerners.  For more on that & What I mean check out Businessman's Arindham Chaudhari's page:    http://arindamchaudhuri.blogspot.com/200...|`|71EfcyJzaa	Pesudo Morality......!! What to say more......!!|`|Nn0PFyOKaa	You have an answer here, from an Indian living in India, and, She is a doctor, but she is disguised by her Yahoo Answers I D - the truth and the reality are not insulting to those honest people who know the truth.  India is a very poor country, and the rich are getting richer off the poor there as they do everywhere, so what is new about that ?    The poor struggle everywhere in the world and are also ridiculed by others.  I remember once when I was a child we lived in the valley by the riverbank.  A decent neighborhood with working people and clean neat homes but not wealthy.  the wealthy lived up on the surrounding hills, the wealthier, the higher up.  Once when our river had flooded and overflowed it's banks, the water was right up to our porch, thank goodness it never came into the house when those floods came, but our older homes had been built up for this reason.  Small row boats would cruise up and down the streets and once one was passing by and saw my family on the porch, and we heard them say,   '''LOOK, at the RIVER RATS ! '''    I never forgot that but from that time on, I felt proud that I lived in the town ''flats'' as they were called and in the valley.  We were kinder people there and would have never spoken that mean and hateful way about somebody.      The reality was that we were poorer, our parents worked in the mills and didn't run them, but we were good people and they educated their children, as I was, and then had a wonderful life after that humble beginning.      When we are afraid that someone might get offended by the truth and we hesitate to tell the truth, it's time to take back the courage to tell the truth just as it is and to he** with those ridiculous people who would hide the truth.    PS  I just now saw the movie and it was excellent, unbelievably excellent.  If Indians complained about this movie, they have missed the whole point of it , and the superb acting, masterful story, directing, and photography.  All that and it was also the love story of a lifetime.  SEE IT, It's one of the best films yet.|`|wz8gx3gaaa	Not all Indians are unhappy with Slumdog Millionare and few people who have issues with the film have a bonafide point as it is somewhat Poverty Porn.

Exv4AjqCaa	Ignore anyone telling you its something you're born with etc i SEVERELY doubt that. We all have a set of vocal folds, we all start off breathing in the same manner...all our voices will sound different but thats about it. All of us can sound good singing.    Normally at first it depends on the kind of music you listen to & how much you practise singing. Then whether you train yourself or get trained beyond that.    For instance lots of kids who listen to Rnb constantly, and sing along to that very often develop good voices. Just because the style of singing is more complex, contains runs and things like that which they try to master...makes their voices more flexible and they have to have learned to not strain their voices to achieve this. When a voice is relaxed you then naturally achieve vibrato etc it just works easily.    Where as most of us will pick up bad habits, maybe we'll sing to quietly so no one hears and we pick that habit up, or we start straining to hit notes that we arent trained to hit yet...we start getting into a habit of straining when we sing higher..    All of it can all be trained and improved. Even people that cant hear notes well can learn how to. You can learn to drop the bad habits, all of it. Start doing vocal exercises daily & you will see an improvement. The key is to not try to sing notes that you cannot reach, thats normally what gets most people. The more relaxed your voice is the better it will sound...but it takes practise to achieve that. Plus research.|`|AQFwSLgiaa	No.  Some people who have that natural talent can strengthen and improve their range and will sound amazing no matter what.  But if a person can't sing, there is no hope. You can't change the way your voice sounds like but only to widen their range. So thats the shitty part. They can take lessons but they're just wasting their money.  Having natural talent can make you a good singer and not having natural, not really. It's something you're usually born with. People sing to make themselves feel happy and they shouldn't stop just because they can't sing. It's the truth. ASk any vocalist who knows about voice. If you have a crappy voice there is no way no chnage it but only to strengthen it and improve their vocal range but your voice will still sound the same. No matter how hard they try, thats all that they can do.|`|i4SVk2Cpaa	its something you're born with. some people are WAY too tone deaf that they shouldnt even consider ever trying to sing.|`|m1493Va4aa	i think someone can get "tranned" to sing good,   but usally people who are born with it  generally sing better    but....    i think singing is not all about people to listen    i think singing is something that makes people happy  and in a good mood when their down in the dumps    i don't think people who "don't sing good"  should stop singing if it makes them happy.    that's just my opinion :D    -Kandy|`|BAAehgWlaa	IT'S TALENT AND PRACTICE, MORE PRACTICE. AND LITTLE HELP FROM TECH IN THE RECORDING STUDIO.|`|i8Pl0Pejaa	Anyone can be a singer if they really really tried.

6113592ee4cd8092af2e3a43a226cb9daa	wow...      I've read it's the same as it was a tSundance: horrifying, but not graphic in any way.  Apparently all the controversy was (slightly) overblown.|`|NrOuDXW4aa	After being panned at Sundance the movie was heavily re editted and a lot of scenes were cut.  However the rape scene remained without any changes.  All the controversy was about the rape scene which in fact is more suggested than actual, you will see far more graphic rape or sex scenes on tv.    I think the movies failing was more in its lack of real depth in characterisation than in any of its more lurid scenes.  You never really understand what motivates most of the characters.
VCS4f7Pjaa	I think you should wax his legs    and     For a French Maid costume you should get his hair done into a girly updo in a salon and afterwards take him to a nail salon and get Acrylic nails put on his nails and toes with a French manicure/french pedicure with his hair all done up girly and then put him in some black stilettos to show off his pedi. !

If they were still alive while being nailed to the board, they would have been wiggling so much they could not peel off the skin.  They were nailed due to the slipperiness.  Hosea's was just laying limp when he started peeling.    It's just a fact of life that they do this in their field.  I don't like to think of how poultry is treated when it goes to slaughter.  Maybe we should all become vegetarians, but I would not be contacting PETA - they are way over the top to the point they don't want turtles to be kept as pets.    Edit:  Heimmeka is right.  I was going to put that in my answer but thought again because the chef's french accent was so thick I did not think I heard him right.  He did talk about the nervous system and how complex it was even when they are dead.  I just thought I did not understand correctly.

""The site gives members the chance to earn points as a way to encourage participation"""    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Answe...    """"""The points system is weighted to encourage users to answer questions and to limit spam questions. There are also levels (with point thresholds) which give more site access.[6] Aside from this, points and levels have no real world value, cannot be traded, and serve only to indicate how active a user has been on the site. A notable downside to the points/level side is that it encourages people to answer questions even when they do not have a suitable answer to give, in order to gain points. Users also receive ten points for contributing the "Best Answer" which is selected by the question's asker or voted on by the community. Contributors often vote for their own answer regardless of its quality or appropriateness. On the other hand, many people ask questions not to gain more knowledge.    The point system encourages users to answer as many questions as they possibly can, up to their daily limit. Once a user shows that they are knowledgeable within a specific category they may receive an orange 'badge' under the name of their avatar naming them a "Top Contributor". The user can then lose this badge if they do not maintain their level and quality of participation.[7]. Once a user becomes a "Top Contributor" in any category, the badge appears in all answers, questions, and comments by the user regardless of category.

Users may tag an interesting question with a star, and the list of users who have so tagged a question is made public.[8] On Answers profile pages, users can track how many stars they have received for their questions. However, a user may un-star a question at will. In the event a question is deleted, any stars it had at the time of deletion are still credited to the askers account.

eblcLGubaa	Sorry to tell you this, but NO WAY are you going to get a contract with a music producer on ya. If they gave away contracts like this record labels and producers would be bankrupt. It's not that easy so if you really want to do this figure out how instead of expecting everyone to work for you.    Sorry if this sounds harsh, but it's gotta be said.|`|8478b8de7e84637d2b4117c1696b3343aa	Do your school work and be a good student .

I think it will be better unless you don't want to finish school. Go ahead and do that.  Thats what I did. I waited and I will be recording my demos soon.  Finish school maybe first then do your career. What happen if it back fires. I'm sure it won't but you'll be on the lucky side that you have your high school diploma if you wait and finish your schooling.|`|8E59Idahaa	can you send me a cover???

If your really good find a small recording studio to help you make a demo  to many people out here will take advantage of you.  Try a local talent agency  and ask them about making a demo.  you don't want to sign a long term contract just find someone who will give you a development deal    they will help you get started for a fee then if you get a shot they will help you negotiate  a  contract to a record studio  Like porcila said stay in school while all this goes on and learn as much as you can . the smarter you are the better you will be able to handle all the crap that comes at you.
jfndnJbqaa	Well, I've read the books and I thought they did okay for the movie...they definately could have had more of the book in it.

vkIqaFQ1aa	That is terrible story, one that makes us all feel shame as humans.  On a much, much less severe level, here is my little story.    I was once ashamed of my boss when he dealt very shabbily towards someone.  I said to him, "I have always considered you to be an honourable person, in fact I have stood up for you when people have said otherwise. Now I am ashamed to have to work with you."

Capricorn|`|mD7eAAoNaa	Scorpios are actually emotional people, they are after all a water sign. The people you may know must have an Air moon or Capricorn moon.|`|xUKLUSL5aa	scorpios are extremely emotional. we just hide it really well so we dont seem so vulnerable. our feelings run very deep. and what do you mean we dont care? we are very loyal to our close ones. we feel our loved ones feelings too. passionate and compassionate. but yea we have our down falls like i guess not showing our emotions to the world. but we are people too.|`|NNki7qiFaa	No because I am a Scorpio.|`|Po6dgusAaa	I don't hate any one because of their sun sign.I dislike a person because of the way they act.    Capricorn Here|`|fldXZ1BMaa	No my sister is a Scorpio and and i am a Capricorn and i love her. She acts tough and never shows when shes feeling sad or upset but we are really close so she opens up to me and i have seen a extremely emotional side to her and she is very caring. I think you met a couple of not so nice ones but they won't all be like that remember you can't go purely on the sun, sign birth charts and the way these people have grown up will also have an effect on their personality.|`|72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	No, I do not despise Scorpio's. First, I'm not the type of person that despises someone simply because of their zodiac sign. If people do this just solely on what sign you are then they need to grow up and stop being ignorant. If I despise someone or don't like them or whatever it's because of them as an individual. I don't blame it on what sign they are and people shouldn't do that because it's stereotyping and generalizing. People that share the same sign don't always act alike, think alike, have the same traits, personalities, etc..... I know plenty of Scorpio's. My brother is a Scorpio and I have family and friends that share this sign too and I have absolutely no problems with any of them. If anything they are some of the sweetest and most laid back people I know personally.    By the way I'm a Sagittarius|`|y5957sd2aa	wahhhhh wahhhhhhhhhhh go cry somewhere else.  i love capricorns but you are the only capriWHORE i dont like.|`|WbyFUQJbaa	Pisces...I like scorpios...one of my friends is one!|`|WgfbRySAaa	Of course we have feelings we're people too. I'm a Scorpio with my moon in Gemini and even though my moon is in an air sign I'm still sensitive, but I do hide my feeling a lot... to protect myself.|`|821bd483afcea62cd9c3a4d1aa91236caa	ok? you're not a scorpio, so why are you judging us?   just because you know a scorpio doesn't mean you can know what they feel.|`|FyZsJh0waa	scorpios are ok to me    ..............    lmao    you do know that scorpio is one of the most emotional signs ever    and capricorn is usually seen as a unemotional sign..........    so wtf?|`|jNiCHwamaa	We do get emotional hun but we don't want to be seen as weak so we put up a front. the scorpio males are worse especially if they like you. I can be hurting and crying out inside but on the outside i can put up a hard face like i never even shed a tear. Its just a way of showing the enemy that they haven't won the battle.     If you really get close to a scorpio, then you'll find out that we really are emotional people, but then again it takes a long time to really get close to one

She was manipulative and sneaky  2. She played power games with her close friends  3. She was obsessive about guys  4. She always had to be the best    But I won't deny that she WAS a great friend and caring, while it lasted.|`|1PdUecpYaa	i know what you're talking about. scorpios can be loyal friends and everything but if you hurt their feelings, expect to be emotionally tortured. it happened to me and now i go bitter everytime i meet them...|`|5c2fe3e37d81de0346a4cb54ae68d534aa	Im an Scorpio, and I'm the kinda of person that cares for others before myself.

My best friend is a scorpio and I am a taurus, we get along great, even though we are opposite signs.|`|jNiCHwamaa	Ok! i think if its a guy you talking about here then i can understand you cuz they can come across as sneaky, but its only because we take such a long time to trust someone enough to let them into our lives. So if you not patient enough then just leave that person alone, but if you are then stick around to find out just how faithful and caring we are|`|y5957sd2aa	arrrgghh you are so annoying scorpios are never gonna give a flying fkc about you get over it and find something new to talk about you sad piece of crap!! over and over with these questions about scorps.. go cry to ur mama you dumb loser!!

3EBKrVrDaa	So she shouted out bye  Then pulled trigger  Before he could stop her  Her finger moved quicker  Now Old johnny's crying cause' he lost his wife  So he takes out his knife and ends his life    Edit: Erin, those lyrics are pure gold. You didn't provide anything so I wouldn't be talking smack. I edited the "private part" out, as I agree it was a little inappropriate. I also edited some other parts too. You don't have to cry about it, you provided nothing and I provided some lyrics to actually use.  Calling me a jack*** and raging about what I said makes you look immature and just as stupid as you think I am.    Edit  2: Fine, Jessica. I'll re-write the lyrics just for you. You should've told us what direction you wanted the song to go, instead of calling our reply's 'dumb' for your mistake.    He grabbed her arm, she tried to resist  He said "don't do it, just think of the kids"  Now at this point old johnny was scared out of his mind  All he wanted to do was rewind the hands of time  He would've never ignored her which led her to this.  So he started whispering that he still loves just like she had wished  Her face looked shocked and her eyes looked glad  She put down the gun and sealed up the past.    That's all I got...|`|ViHe4VhWaa	I personally found that you have no right in responding to Matt's post in this manor. He done what was asked, provided lyrics. Why should he be banned? For listening and doing what someone asked? Wow. That's just pure fail. Saying that your not creative is completely irrelevant and should be considered as spam. However using the term "Jackass" is what I consider offensive and have flagged you. I personally am very offended by this term.    Anyhow back to the plot.    Old johnny was sitting in his rocking chair  he heard a noise comming from upstairs  he opened up the door, and she was lying on the floor  with a gun in her hand saying "this is the end"    Old johnny yelled "Do it I dare you!"  So she did, and blew her brains all over the wall  Johnny sank from being so tall  and asked himself "Why the hell did I say that!"      *EDIT*    After reading your Additional details section I think you should rather be asking; "Can someone provide me with lyrics which are kind of depressing and not contain lyrics of the following "Blowing your brains out""  You however didn't. I answered your question as you wanted and then you reply like this? Why bother asking if your just going to call answers dumb.  Erin's answer was a lot dumber then both mine and Matt's put together because hers was COMPLETELY off-topic. This is a free Q/A site. Expect answers like this.  If you want it more depressing.    Old johnny yelled "Do it I dare you!"  So she did, but missed  And started eternally crying  For she failed epically at suicideeeeeeeee!"    Better? I find this rather depressing myself.

0ZM3TCXCaa	I think that this part of the song still fits in with the rest. You are right about what the song is about. The first two lines are about people telling them to just get over it and move on and stuff. And the third and fourth line is about how this incident has changed their entire lives in many ways, but they are not going to change or "make nice" because they like how they are sticking to their guns and are not going to forget about what happened or get over it. They like how this has changed their whole world and aren't going to make nice just because you want them to.
oOSNI3wbaa	well you're kind of chasing your tail on this one. you've fallen for him yet you dont want to see him at all because he's not ready to be in a serious relationship right now, yet you're both making plans for a few years from now???  now i understand that you like the guy. but what you need to understand is that if you dont see him AT ALL then he's never going to develop feelings for you and your "two year plan" is going to crumble. and all he did was ask you out to a movie. friends do that. it doesnt mean that he wants something serious. its a movie. people go all the time.  so my advice is to take it easy and just nurture your friendship with him. it's the best thing you can do. it cant hurt any future relationship if you're good friends first. it can only help. but if you start to ignore him and decide not to be around him at all, i guarantee you that it'll never happen. go to the movie.    and i'm a virgo, by the way|`|0y0hgeWDaa	im in the same situation and i honestly dont know what to do.  your best bet is to have a another guy  just incase|`|CHCPnvksaa	Virgos absolutely don't emotionally torture, they are actually very straightforward about what they want. Not wanting a relationship now makes sense because he has a goal in mind and they are very meticulous and don't like distractions, even if it's a good distraction like you. They're very independent so you have to just let him do his thing. But he also sees you as a good friend at this time and just because there's not relationship further than friendship, in his eyes that's not a good enough reason for him to not see you. You would have to act like a total a**hole to him for him to not be interested in having you in his life.
pmt0tcQ5aa	I LOVE RASCAL FLATTS!!!   And, I guess my favorite song is My Wish! But they r all sooooo good!!! :)|`|WGcfzIfKaa	both|`|88E3oEm0aa	I love Nickelback, they make great songs. my favourite songs by them are... Animals, follow you home, fight for the wrong reasons flat on the floor and tons more. they make great classic songs. ive never heard of that other band|`|bUNrQVQyaa	Both great.|`|r95t1E67aa	I love them both....  I'd have to say   Stand, Bless the Broken Road, My Wish, Winner At A Losing Game, Red, White, and Blue (w/brian Mcknight I think), and lots more  Gotta Be Somebody, If Everyone Cared, Rockstar, How You Remind Me, Hero, Far Away|`|sqeWNMbuaa	Grr... The lead singer of Nickelback was caught speeding/drunk driving down one of the smaller streets in my hometown (the band is based in one of the neighbouring city). It was some crazy speed like 120km/h (Something like 70 or 60mph) in his sports car. The trial didn't take place for a long time after the incident because he (whatever the lead singer's name is again) was "busy" or "couldn't make it". When he did have a trial his sentence to something like a year of no driving in our city. Guess what his reaction was? The newspaper caught it, he was laughing as walked out of the courtroom with his "rock star" like sunglasses.    So you can probably guess which one of the two I like the most.    Sorry, had to blow some steam there.|`|07YBD5mJaa	I love both bands, they are two of my most favorite bands.  =]|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	They're two entirely different bands, and I'm not much of a fan of either.

SPErDVrZaa	Savage Garden sings it, the song is called "Truly, Madly, Deeply"    I'll be your dream  I'll be your wish  I'll be your fantasy.  I'll be your hope  I'll be your love  Be everything that you need.  I love you more with every breath  Truly madly deeply do..  I will be strong I will be faithful  'Cos I'm counting on a new beginning.  A reason for living.  A deeper meaning.  Chorus    I want to stand with you on a mountain.  I want to bathe with you in the sea.  I want to lay like this forever.  Until the sky falls down on me...    And when the stars are shining brightly  In the velvet sky,  I'll make a wish  Send it to heaven  Then make you want to cry..  The tears of joy  For all the pleasure and the certainty.  That we're surrounded  By the comfort and protection of..  The highest power.  In lonely hours.  The tears devour you..  I want to stand with you on a mountain,  I want to bathe with you in the sea.  I want to lay like this forever,  Until the sky falls down on me...  Bridge    Oh can't you see it baby?  You don't have to close your eyes  'Cos it's standing right before you.  All that you need will surely come...    I'll be your dream  I'll be your wish  I'll be your fantasy.  I'll be your hope  I'll be your love  Be everything that you need.

It is impossible to shield a person from life changing knowledge, and if we could, would we? Experiences don't necessarily change the core of someone's personality but allow them to make more informed judgments, which is ultimately a positive result. The more knowledge you have about a situation the more relevant the decision will be. I don't condone all change however, and there is an extent to how far change and the accumulation of knowledge is beneficial. Living to see your loved ones murdered and then swearing revenge, for example, is not going to be productive for a better, more informed life.|`|u23sua9daa	Change happens to everyone if you like it or not.

So the guy insists on keeping the case open, by pretty much admitting that he killed the rich collector and the guy on the boat. Episode ends with the guy discussing a plea with his lawyer (he's going to jail, of course) and Cutter admitting to Rubirosa that he never even did the DNA test. All a bluff.

A bass is lower pitched, with only 4 thicker strings and is designed to only enhance both the melody and drum or percussion rhythm by laying down a skeleton of the percussion/rhythm. Bass guitars are usually thumbed or struck with fingers or a soft, thick, hard felt pick.   Hope that makes sense.

To make some money off his corpse selling to medical students.  3. A turtle dove is a girl who poses as a maid,   to get into someones house and rob them blind.  4. He wants to hold random hangings to prove he's doing something   about crime in the points.  5. Jenny's scar is from a baby that was cut out of her belly  6. Tweed sees the Irish as votes  7. Amsterdam had just killed someone who was getting revenge for people like Priest Vallon. He (Bill's intended assassin)shouts "for the blood of the Irish" before he(Amsterdam) caps him(the Irish Assassin). I guess Amsterdam wanted to do the honors(2 Kill Bill) himself.  8. Bill himself cut out his own eye as punishment for looking away just as Priest Vallon was going to kill him. But Vallon spared his life instead. Allowing him to live in shame.|`|Ge6oHWQ1aa	Is this homework for you?  And did you even watch the movie? It's pretty good.|`|17980697ca3cc122abed634ac3838430aa	Hm. It's been a while since I watched that movie, so I only know a few of these:    1) Amsterdam's father  3) A Turtle Dove is the nickname for a person who rob a house by pretending to be one of the servants.  5) I think she had to have a C-section   7) Amsterdam had always planned to murder Bill as revenge for killing his father, but he'd grown to admire Bill and become friends. So he was upset because a) someone tried to kill his friend and b) his "friend" was a murderer who he was eventually going to have to kill anyway.  8) Bill cut out his own eye, out of shame when he was too scared to face Amsterdam's father in battle.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	1. That is an image of Priest Vallon, Amsterdam's father. Bill explains he is the only man he respects, and the only man worth killing.    2. Because doctors/researchers pay money for cadavers and he wanted to impress Bill the Butcher to get closer to him.    3.  A Turtle Dove is a female who poses as a housemaid and steals belongings from the house.    4.  ?    5.  Jenny's scar came from when her baby was removed.    6.  votes? not sure on that one    7.  Amsterdam wants to kill Bill himself to avenge his father.    8.  Priest Vallon, Amsterdam's father. [correction: as the other answerer said, Bill cut out his own eye since he couldn't look Vallon in the eye after his beating by Vallon.|`|5be9aa5e850f569d457ff490fdccb316aa	1.

A woman who goes the rich uptown part of the city disguised as a maid in order to steal from houses.    4. Hanging. Four men.    5. Home performed abortion, done by Bill.    6. Votes    7. Because he saved his life when he really wanted him dead, but he wanted to do it himself.    8. Himself|`|AwBVoWOaaa	1. Amsterdam's dad  2.  3.  4.  5. An abortion she had.

Or I don't remember really well because I saw this movie when it first came out, but I think Bill gave Amterdam's dad his eye because he let him live. Correct me if I'm wrong

nG6EUUtsaa	I am not sure what you want to know, anyhow i will try to answer.    Scrubs is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning American comedy-drama that premiered on October 2, 2001, on NBC. It was created by Bill Lawrence and is produced by ABC Studios.  The show focuses on the lives of several people working at Sacred Heart, a teaching hospital. It features fast-paced dialogue, slapstick, and surreal vignettes presented mostly as the daydreams of the central character, Dr. John Michael "J.D." Dorian. The name is a play on surgical scrubs and scrubs as slang for the new and inexperienced.    Supernatural is an American horror television series that concerns the paranormal.   The series follows the brothers Dean and Sam Winchester, played by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, who travel across the country in a black 1967 Chevy Impala investigating and combating paranormal events and other unexplained occurrences, many of them based on folklore, myths, and American urban legends, as well as classic supernatural creatures such as vampires, werewolves, and ghosts. Eric Kripke, the series' creator, cites Neil Gaiman's The Sandman and American Gods as influences on Supernatural, along with American Werewolf in London and Joseph Campbell's The Hero's Journey.|`|GNtWomekaa	Scrubs by far.

TDVGgRAWaa	Scorps: Your match can be either one= Heaven or Hell.   The good thing is that scorps are very loyal, lovable and relation makers. So they usually try to carry a relation to a long length for they [hate to be hated and love to be loved!!!!]  2ndly, I think that you fit the discription of a dedicated scorp as you were motivated to ask about your relation as you worship your relation.    For mars in scorpio, it means that you are the type who does each thing with a lot of passion. For your boyfriend, a scorp is like him in the bed only if he truely loves you; and he does.    Best is to go on long drives or an isolated place to be together.  :)  If you truely love eachother, so fights are not needed.( a bit is normal)|`|8YMZPwqnaa	Viagra !!|`|Em0Nf6Fpaa	Depends on where his other planets are in his chart and the houses. I had a Scorpio sun lover once - who was all right but not the most sexual or adventurous person I've known. He was Mars in Virgo, Venus in Scorpio. Can't remember his rising sign.    I'm Pisces Sun, Mars in Scorpio. I had the much harder time letting go and could only do so after inflicting revenge on him. It was quite satisfying. Proof of the pudding?|`|lJB9ab4Iaa	Hmmm, it's hard to say I think you two would be equal. Since you have a Mars in Scorpio, you are attracted TO scorpios (hence why your guy is a scorpio probably) those two planets stand for two different things so comparing them isn't really equal. What's your sun sign? that would give better measure.

Gucci Mane I guess has something to his lyrics... while Soulja Boy's are just kind of random stuff he came up with. Both of their flows are wack, but I guess Soulja Boy's is a little better.    Overall, I would say Gucci just because he keeps it real. Soulja Boy is just coming up with "whatever."|`|veYE50Vsaa	SB is just making himself look stupid.

30382610d52200580f226b83141cbabdaa	You mean like this?  The lead singer, Isaac Slade, posted this on thefray.net website along with the video.   "You Found Me is a tough song for me. Its about the disappointment, the heart ache, the let down that comes with life. Sometimes you're let down, sometimes you're the one who lets someone else down. It gets hard to know who you can trust, who you can count on. This song came out of a tough time, and I'm still right in the thick of it. There's some difficult circumstances my family and friends have been going through over the past year or so and can be overwhelming. It wears on me. It demands so much of my faith to keep believing, keep hoping in the unseen. Sometimes the tunnel has a light at the end, but usually they just look black as night. This song is about that feeling, and the hope that I still have, buried deep in my chest."|`|fESZI0X2aa	the song You Found Me is actually about his relationship with God. like in an interview Isaac said that over the past few years his friends and family had been through a lot and this song kind of shows the baggage he had and also how he's very thankful.like he said that God was not where he need Him to be and when he needed it but eventually He finds him.    btw I FREEKING LOVE THE FRAY!IM SO OBSESSED WITH THEM!THEY HAV THE BEST MUSIC!=]

xqrwDmyUaa	Yeah he needs to get his temper and his ego in check, being a famous actor doesn't make you better or worth more than anyone else. Whether it be other workers on the set or your family (you know how he got into it with them). Anyway I will still see his movies (if they look interesting), because I judge the films based on plot and not who the actors or director are.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	Ok, he is an asshole and a great actor. I suppose someone would have to understand the pressure of maintaining such depth of character and then to be, in this case, apparently pulled out of TWICE quite abruptly by some dope that keeps interfering with the scene.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Muggers (2000)--An Australian black comedy.  Brad (Matt Day) and Gregor (Jason Barry) are eager med students struggling to make ends meet. Thanks to government cutbacks, they are forced to share a cockroach-infested one-bedroom apartment, which they rent from their odious landlord (Reg Evans), and they're even forced to share the same bed. Their living situation is made even worse by their obnoxious neighbors; one guy who lives upstairs (Robert Carlton) engages in loud parties and noisy lovemaking at all hours of the night while another guy's car alarm constantly goes off. Unable to sleep or eat, much less study, the two are on the brink of giving up their studies. To make matters even worse, they are up to their stethoscopes in debt to a gangster. Brad and Gregor's luck changes when they learn of a noted surgeon, Marcus Browning (Rod Mullinar), who is willing to pay top dollar for organs, just before a sharply-dressed yuppie takes a flying leap and splatter-lands at their feet. Thinking quickly, Brad yanks out a kidney, crams it in an ice cream carton, and carries it over to Browning. Counting their cash, they realize that they have happened upon a neat little way of getting out of the red.|`|sYqSMmWoaa	sounds like muggers

I've found listening to other songs some that have nothing to do with breaking up helps. Some songs of how you want your next love to be like.   Beyonce - Halo  Kevin Edmonds - 24/7  Simple plan - Perfect  Shorty wanna be a thug - 2pac for some reason the beat soothed me.  Just think about other things and get out as much as you can and go hang with your girlfriends or people you care about and just have fun. Focusing on me has helped a lot as well looking within myself and other places spiritually to find out what to do. To find what I need, what I really want. It will be ok.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Shocker (1989)  IMDb synopsis: ***SPOILERS***  A murderous TV repairman, Horace Pinker (Mitch Pileggi Skinner of "The X-Files") is wreaking havoc in a small town. He eventually finds the home of Lt. Parker (Michael Murphy), who is investigating his crimes, and savagely murders Parker's wife, son and daughter. His other son, Jonathan (Peter Berg), has a strange connection to Pinker through his dreams, and he directs his father to Pinker's business, where a small group of officers enter. Pinker escapes in a horrific spree, killing four officers then targeting Jonathan's girlfriend, Alison (Camille (Cami) Cooper). Another dream leads Jonathan and his dad to a residence where they catch Pinker in the act of kidnapping. Pinker is arrested after a fight with Jonathan and sentenced to die in the electric chair. When executed, Pinker receives the power to come back as an energy source, taking over people's bodies and continuing committing murders.  IMDb review excerpt:  Pinker murders the family of Jonathan Parker (Peter Berg), a high school football star.  IMDb review excerpt:  Once Pinker has become this electrical traveling journeyman, only one thing can stop him from taking over a host shell until the lifeforce is sucked dry: strong willpower or a specific heart-shaped necklace worn by Jonathan's beloved, one of Pinker's victims.     Here's the movie trailer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEbGJugUk...    The boy's girlfriend IS killed by Pinker, and the locket is pivotal in the story as she manages to contact the beleagured youth who learns a dark secret about his connection to the killer.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  While I'm not crazy about the film, which was Wes Craven's failed attempt to create a bad guy with as much impact as Freddy Krueger, I do love the songtrack of hard rock/Heavy Metal used for this film, including the "power ballad" "Timeless Love" by Saraya and "Sword & Stone" by Bonfire.   Here's "Timeless Love", but I couldn't find the original video that uses footage from "Shocker":  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DWgcXLfd...|`|UnMramoWaa	It might be Shocker but only some of your description fits this movie, so maybe, maybe not.|`|yvmFKoPHaa	I'm not sure but it sounds like My Boyfriends Back

Viki forgave him; David shared a somewhat heartfelt goodbye with Dorian, and made yet another quick escape from Llanview. A few weeks passed before Dorian and Viki each got a postcard from David.       In October 2006, David had discovered that long ago Asa had engaged in an affair with David's mother, Emma Bradley. Asa had denied it. Spencer had claimed to be Asa's son, but a DNA test proved otherwise. On August 17, 2007 during Asa's funeral, his longtime butler Nigel Bartholomew-Smythe told Max Holden that Asa indeed had another son: David. One of Asa's many ex-wives, Alex Olanov, overheard the conversation and began a search for David herself. In November, Alex found David working at a rehabilitation clinic; acting the part of a wealthy widow with a sex addiction, Alex preyed upon old acquaintance David's greed to convince him to marry her, never mentioning his true parentage. They wed that month and Alex brought her new husband to Texas, where Asa's will was being read. Desperate to protect the family and keep the secret that con-man David was a Buchanan, Nigel turned his own inheritance over to Alex in exchange for her silence. Alex annulled her marriage to David, who was still unaware of his paternity, and Nigel reluctantly conspired with Jared Banks to pass off Jared as Asa's son. Dorian, meanwhile, showed up at the Buchanan ranch to be with Clint, whom she was dating. But when Dorian falsely believed that Clint was having an affair with Nora, she slept with David. Clint walked in on Dorian and David and called it quits with her. Down on his luck and not realizing he was really an heir to the Buchanan fortune, David soon left town, armed only with a $1 lottery ticket given to him by Viki.

OzfprFaWaa	NO....      IF you are underage, you have to be with someone who is 21 years old or older to act as guardian.  You can't just have someone buy you the ticket and leave.  We know this trick and look out for that thing.  And believe me, you do NOT want to be taken out of a full auditorium.  I suggest getting someone older to take you or just wait for the movie to come out if you dont want your parents going with you.  Don't try something cause we know EVERy trick in the book, and we actually think that it is funny how many different things people try to get away with.  We even had some people tell there plans in front of the box office window and we had MICROPHONES on... HILARIOUS!!!!|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	The official MPAA definition says "Under 17 requires and accompanying parent or adult guardian". Unfortunately there is no specific guidance on what is or isn't an adult guardian, but many theatres expect someone to be at least in their mid 20's.    I would strongly recommend calling the theatre or looking on their web site for their specific policy on who is considered an adult guardian. It's better to know ahead of time than to have your date or night out ruined because you can't see the movie you want.    Keep in mind the MPAA ratings system is completely voluntary. Theatres may choose how they enforce the ratings, or if they enforce them at all.|`|324cdd2706638f6d6bf41b469c741e8caa	no, the person must be at least 18 to count as a "legal guardian". sorry but maybe if they check their ID first, they won't ask you for yours|`|y2Uks58paa	just have her buy both the tickets and if that doesnt work u could just buy a ticket to another movie then just go into the R rated one|`|K1JGsa8Caa	21 years or older is considered a guardian.

People that study astrology get even more confused the deeper they go. The reason for this is that the Sun and the moon don't have anything to do with two people getting along. Not at all and especially when you are talking about the emotional signs of Cancer and Scorpio. Scorpio is the extreme sign, and has power trips. If neither of you are yielding to each other then how could either of you ever be happy with the relationship. You won't give an inch and neither will he.      Now about the sneakiness, that is from your point of view. Everybody has their own view points and you think that he is sneaky. I'm not even saying that you are wrong but I am saying that it's your view point. You are a triple water person. Emotions run way way deep for you. But since you are a Scorpio I would suggest that you go to the extreme positive mode. Or kill him. It's your choice.

The black exorcist and his assistant (Pryor) are scared out of the minds but continue their work.  When the demon child starts calling their mama names they both start beating her up.  Oh God it was hysterical.  A must see.  .  During his stand up act he mentions a black exorcist would have been too blunt.

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	At first, my childish side thought "oh, good - a chance for a rant". Then I thought that some Yiruma lovers might actually read the responses to your question and so I thought it would be of more use to try to explain WHY questions about "River Flows Up Your Bum", "Bela Lugosi's Lullaby" and "Kiss the Rain, get a wet face" provoke the reactions they do.    1) For the last 3-4 months questions about these pieces have been posted in the classical music section up to 5-6 times every single day (I can't remember a day when at least one question wasn't posted). Such ignorance and laziness is deplorable. Very few questions are unique and most have been posted time and time again. A quick dip into Y!A's lovely search bar would reveal the hundreds of questions and answers on this subject. In any event, Yiruma does not write classical music and his pieces are not works of classical music. It is instrumental pop. Just because music is played on a piano, it does not mean it qualifies as classical music.    2) Make no mistake - the vast majority of regular contributors in the classical music section have nothing against non-classical music. I know I am not alone in enjoying jazz, rock, pop and film music as well as classical. However, in ANY genre, these pieces would be meaningless pap. The music is so bad and so basic that a moderately gifted child could probably accidentally produce something like Yiruma simply by playing arpeggios, consonant chords and various other 'pretty' sounds (for it is the 'prettiness' that seems to appeal to the teenage girls). It is that compositional cynicism by these musical frauds that makes our blood boil so.    3) As music, these pieces show no originality, no sincerity, no harmonic progression or tension/release, no rhythmic interest and no melodic interest. They are simple series of chords and arpeggios designed to sound 'nice'. Hardly great music deserving of respect! Nice to make a quick buck out of the gullible, the stupid and the hormonally challenged!    I think many of us yearn for the day with the infestation of "Twilight" and fraudulent, worthless 'composers' such as Yiruma, Yanni and Ein-Audi (thank you, Dr John!) no longer curse our section.    One can dream, can't one?

kuiWXTw9aa	Heh...if you find the answer, let me know.    I'm a Scorpio, too, so I know what it's like.  I'm extremely secretive and I have trouble exposing vulnerability in front of others.  However, it can be done.  Sometimes, you just have to trust the person you're with, and believe that they'll accept you, however you express your emotions.    I tend to bottle things inside until they explode and I end up letting everything out.  However, I usually feel MUCH better after I let it out.  So, logically, it would probably feel even better to express my emotions BEFORE they get to that point...but I still have trouble expressing my feelings to people.  I often feel shy and embarrassed when I try to do this.    Anyway, it can be difficult to go against our Scorpio nature and open up to someone, but I believe it can be done.  Even if we can't expose vulnerability in front of others all the time, we can at least do it some of the time.    I'm sorry I don't have a proper answer for you...I'm trying to find the answer as well.  I hope something somewhere in this rambling "answer" of mine made sense and helped you in some way.|`|vY6Hg2vnaa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1783465 6dzz5z5...|`|XJTynEaMaa	You need to know more about a Scorpio and its compatibility.

VjgdnzvVaa	Sam Crow (actually, SAMCRO) stands for "Sons of Anarchy Motorcyle Club Redwood Original". This is in reference to their being an original, or charter member of the Sons of Anarchy motorcycle club.     FX has greenlit the pilot Forever Sam Crow, a drama from The Shield executive producer Kurt Sutter about the world of biker gangs in Northern California. Sutter wrote the script and will executive produce along with Art and John Linson. Casting is under way, along with the search for a director; the executive producers and FX hope to get cameras rolling sometime early next year. FX and Linson Films are producing, while another studio will be brought aboard at a later date.    Forever Sam Crow refers to the nickname of the group at the center of the project: The Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original (Samcro). The project was the brainchild of John Linson, who knows several motorcycle club members in Northern California. Set in fictional Charming, California, Forever Sam Crow revolves around 33-year-old Jackson Jax Teller, the vice president of Samcro and son of the late club founder. According to Sutter, the character is at a crossroads in life and figuring out his place in both his blood family and his brotherhood family. Key characters also include Jaxs mother, Gemma Teller, and stepfather, Samcro president Clay Morrow.|`|emjxCeFZaa	what does SAMCRO stand for?

AA11139157	my rising sign is also scorpio and i went on here to find out more about it this is what someone wrote for me:    rising Scorpio  Scorpio rising produces a personality that is deeply reserved, secretive and determined. The power of the personality emerging from a Scorpio Ascendant is so intense, magnetic, and charismatic, that it is often somewhat overwhelming. Symbolized by the scorpion, you have an external "coat of armor" that protects and lets you survive in hostile situations. You are not the sort of person who ever knuckles under, even when pressures and circumstances would defeat lesser souls. When cornered, the famous "deadly scorpion sting" may be brought into play.    With Scorpio on the rise your personality is very powerful. People find you hard to understand, to know what you are thinking at any particular time. There is a hidden depth to your persona that is nearly impossible for others to comprehend. Much of the time you may feel as though you are misunderstood. You are very willful and self-reliant, appearing calm and in control on the surface. Yet there are strong emotions at work inwardly. Scorpio is a water sign, and it is a fixed sign. This means that you are an emotional person. These emotions are very controlled (fixed), giving you the determination and the strength to overcome just about any opponent.    Resentment and jealousy can be intense with you. You always pursue your goals with intensity. You can stand under heavy strain, and be relied upon to stay cool, even in the most serious emergency.    You're inclined to be very suspicious or skeptical, and occasionally you can be "stingingly " sarcastic. Every sign has a positive and negative expression, but with the Scorpio the range of possibilities is extreme. Everything is black or white. There are no shades of gray with Scorpio on the rise. Your penetrating stare can look right through a person or a situation. You can make an instant diagnosis and it is usually the right one.    The Scorpio personality is often maligned as over-sexed, a bit on the evil side, and often bent on revenge. This is not completely true, but Scorpio does get what it wants, when it wants it, most of the time. It is not a personality to be trifled with.      as far as saturn being in scorpio and 12th house i dont know sorry lol- i am not familiar with all that other stuff yet i am interested to learn though but i am not there yet :-)|`|lpyWVR2oaa	With a Scorpio Rising, Pluto and Mars are your chart ruler and because they are found in Scorpio too in the 12th House, the themes of Scorpio and the 12th House becomes of prominent dominance in your personality and individuality.    This combination is never an easy one to live out. For one, the 12th House is one of the most undesirable Houses for any planets to fall into simply because it is the House of One's Undoing and the Subconscious. It represents everything that is in the hidden psyche, and the dark side of Life in general. It rules asylums and prisons.    As such, you are one who has been bestowed with a lot of inherent power and ability to delve easily into the subconscious realm, to discover the hidden motives of others and even yourself. The tendency to self-destruct is potentially high with this placement and if not careful, the abundant energy can sap away your life force.    Nevertheless, you have the uncanny ability to know what binds the whole of humankind and the universal through a sort of universal consciousness that runs through humanity. You have the ability to rise above all the negativism and soar to the heights through radical transformation and regenerative powers but only if you are able to defeat those inner demons that so often plague your subconscious and hidden motives.

McYp8luoaa	7 hours, 30 Minutes.........Math is hard but I think that's right!     It is healthy, the average person gets 6-8 hours.     Under 6 hours = Unhealthy.

Or 7 hours and 30 minutes. Now, If you are in the age group below 13, that would absolutely not be healthy. Ages 13-18, would be not recommended, as for it weakens your immune system and could trigger sickness; You could also feel incredibly exhausted. However, above that, ages 20 -- 30, It is something okay to do, as that is your first years of being fully developed and capable both mentally and physically. In any age group, it is not actually "healthy". Healthy is 8-9 hours of sleep. Try going to sleep at 11:00 and waking up at 7:30 or going to sleep at 10:00 and waking up at 6:30. It is generally not recommended to sleep below 8 hours in any case.

Racist means a person who believes that a certain race is naturally superior or inferior to another race, or races.  Not attributing bad intentions to a 16 year old girl you do not personally know does not provide any evidence in either direction about your racial beliefs.  It has become popular to declare someone racist for disagreeing with opinions expressed by racial minorities. Another popular myth is that racial minorities cannot be racist. This is a racist belief and is false.|`|rtkQzrXsaa	Ohhhh my gosh there isn't anything wrong with the picture hey!  You aren't a racist don't be silly :-P   She has some interesting friends huh!

The media just latches onto ANYTHING that will get people talking. They've done a good job so far lol.|`|cYFAo75Yaa	your white for one thing and most white people never think any thing they do is racist and there lies the problem with racism. it's like an addict who tells you he isn't an addict. if he can't see he has a problem then there is no problem to fix. so he will continue to be an addict. that is why racism is so prevalent in america, because white people don't see it and there for there is nothing to fix. you my friend are a prime example of this with this picture...so what if there is an asian in the pic it's still racist no matter how you slice it.    like i said most of the jokers who answer; not racist, are white and the few who are not white are to young to know what it is. by the way the asian guy looks like a gun is being held to his head and that is a force smile too me and he didn't slant his eyes...this looks to me like a guy who didn't want to rock the boat, but since your not rowing the boat you can't see how tired this gets...|`|kWKZoQogaa	As much as I dislike Miley Cyrus, I doubt they had intended it as a harmful, racist gesture.

I had previously chemically straightened my hair (I had really curly hair before) and I can't tell you how much I regret it!!

But if it's something small and they're really sorry about it, then I usually forgive them.|`|WoEsehoRaa	Absolutely. And at times, when it's hard to forgive...I think "what would Jesus do"?

I couldn't be too attracted to someone I haven't met or got to know in person, or haven't at least heard their voice, or even sent a few emails back and forth. (that doesn't happen here much unless they're guys or just trolls sending hate mail)    plus here on YA, people come and go and sometimes waiting for them seems too distant and disconnected, ya know?    the questions here and the moments people spend together are simply too fleeting.  (not like halo 3 or anything)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aXpk_3xB...    unless you've got a crush on me...... then I'll change my answer to "yes" for the time being = )|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	In a manner of speaking.

Try teaching him sports and getting him interested in football or something. Don't get angry just correct his thinking.|`|bdbbfb522b81600114d8d9902d8d5ad7aa	Dad? Does he even know what gay means?

SkWzsnuxaa	I can't stand ME music! That is not to say they don't produce some very good rock bands. But the actual traditional music kills me.|`|53216puqaa	I'm stumped, like both Lexeme & Belly Dancing Music!
aBOH1vkiaa	I don't think it sucks, but it lacks some of the 'raw power'  of earlier albums (apart from the single 'Rock 'n' Roll Train') with Bon Scott, but when I think of this album I immediately think of a few old mates sitting round for a jam... AC/DC definately have introduced some new material though, the more bluesy 'Stormy May Day', and the more poppy 'Anything Goes'. Although you'll find a lot of AC/DC is blues based. Basically, I think it is a great album.|`|WU4MHq3aaa	best album of 08... its got some new sounds....     Angus and the gang experimented with some new chords... its a good album|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	It's all too similar to every other album they have.  If you've heard one you've heard them all...|`|qAfnWKQCaa	Meh...    TooLegit,  You're right, all of AC/DC's albums do sound the same...                            And its the greatest sound in the world.|`|XhJuHMwQaa	I like it.  It's growing on me too.  But I think I like "Stiff Upper Lip" better.|`|2V1Kr5laaa	I like it. True, it's different from stuff that they've done, although there are some 'safe' sounding tracks on there that is similar to what they've produced before.. but like the person above said, it's the greatest sound in the world, they were and definitely still are a solid band. I especially love "War Machine", "Rock N Roll Train" and "Spoilin' For A Fight"    ps their 2008/2009 tour is amazing, they can still kick *** and sell out stadiums over 30 years into their career and not be cliches lol|`|JOcLk4DNaa	AC/DC is a band that likes to recycle songs and tunes. It's not a matter of it sounding the same it's a matter of good hard rock n' roll which should sound                  The same.....GOOD!!!!

wQfo0thwaa	I think Sonny is too impulsive not to have killed Claudia as soon as he knew.  Look what he did to Karpov, and he didn't even have proof.     Claudia is trying to save her own skin and hope to get compassion from Sonny by telling on her father.|`|p1EpGJAjaa	I don't think he knows. Sonny shows no mercy to those who have 'betrayed' him, no matter how close he is to them.     I'm not sure if Anthony will rat Claudia out anytime soon because he's unpredictable. If he did, taking Claudia out of the equation will affect the bottom line of his plan, which is to take out Sonny and Jason, gain all of the territory and pass it to Johnny some day. But Anthony's crazy and smart so if he does tell on her, he'll have some kind of plan in the works.    Yes, Michael's shooting was an accident and Kate's shooting was premeditated and such, but one tragic event doesn't outweigh the other. The only reason Sonny went hard after Karpov was because the evidence was there. Sure, it was set up that way to frame Karpov, but something was there. If he had any kind of evidence to find out who paid Ian Devlin to be the shooter, he would have went on a rampage similar to the one he had when Kate got shot.    I can think of at least 2 ways he'd let the Claudia's involvement pass is  1) if she struck a deal with him: in exchange for 'saving his life' by ratting out her father, he'd show her the same courtesy after finding out what she did or 2) if he fell in love with her or something.    In either case, what's to stop him from telling Carly or Jason?  I highly doubt both of them will let Claudia get away with it.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	The man is NOT stupid but he sure the heck has been acting like it for the past 6 months. NO I dont think he knows at all, or he wouldnt have married her, he would have shot him dead. He was gonna shot Karpov in broad daylight when he thought he shot Kate, what do you think he would di about the person who shot his son?|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I guess it's possible.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	Sonny and Cher?|`|sJs0nuTSaa	Wow!  First, I agree with Jen, Sonny has been stupid since Michael got shot.  There's no way he knows Claudia was behind it and not reacted before having proof.  As crazy as he was when he thought Karpov shot Kate, he'll be even crazier when he confronts Anthony.  I could definitely see Anthony trying to trade his life for the information of who was really behind Michael's shooting.  I think at best, if Claudia explains how it was all an accident, maybe Sonny would just make her leave town and not kill her.  Carly is another story!  She'd probably try and kill Claudia. :-)|`|M1ymLE9Paa	Nah...if Sonny knew of her involvement, she'd be sleeping w/the fishes by now.|`|ADBMrG87aa	Um...I must disagree on this one.  Sonny has been nothing but stupid all this time and that's what led up to his son getting shot; plain stupidity.  Sonny wouldn't hesitate to bullet in Claudia if he found out the truth.
d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	George Carlin was a man of many talents. The fact that he would come up with    "The seven words you can not say on television" and be the same man who was in Tarzan II and Cars is a tribute to how wide his abilities are.

g2jCrkcPaa	Sun - Aries  Moon - Sagittarius  Rising - Libra    Aries Sun:  "Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and Aries natives are the first to start--and the first to finish--whatever they set out to do. Aries is an active, energetic sign. People with Sun in Aries are direct, straightforward, and uncomplicated. They expect the same from others, and are baffled when they don't always get it.    The body comes first with Aries. Sun in Aries people are natural athletes. At the very least, their natural inclination is to use their bodies to get things done. They're not given to long, drawn-out emotional moments; nor are they big on planning ahead. Instead, they live their lives simply. What is happening right now is most important to Aries. Impatience is a definite vice, and innovation is a huge strength. Aries loves to start anything new, and they have trouble sitting still. They are pioneers in whatever they do, and there is a very basic quality of bravery in these people that is unmistakable! Aries generally knows what they want, and they know the quickest route to getting it. They take shortcuts if they must, but generally everything is aboveboard. Underhanded just isn't their style. Some Aries people are bold, but even the quieter ones are brave and even plucky in their own way. Independence is their birthright. Nothing gets them going more than a fresh slate, the promise of a new day, and a brand new start.    Aries enjoys a challenge, and Aries Suns are happiest when their lives are moving forward and active. There's a childlike quality to all Aries Sun people, and it's often quite charming.    She has a strong personality and an entrepreneurial spirit. She is ambitious and self-willed, stubborn, obstinate and tenacious."    Sagittarius Moon:  "More than anything, Lunar Sagittarians have a need for personal freedom and space. They are extraordinarily happy and easygoing folk, as long as they don't feel caged in or cooped up. Lunar Sagittarians have a simultaneous need for activity. Meeting new people, going out in the world, and travel are all important to their sense of well-being. They love open spaces, and, in their homes, a roomy and bright environment. There's a bit of a teacher in Moon in Sagittarius, and definitely a helpful spirit. They easily forget appointments and the like, and some are even considered irresponsible. However, it is hard to stay angry at a Lunar Sagittarian! They are so cheerful and upbeat, and their optimism is catchy.    Many people with this position are outdoorsy types. At the very least, they have a great love for friendly competition. When the going gets tough, these people run away. They don't like to be caught up in routine for too long, and they simply need to escape. There's a blind faith in Lunar Sagittarians that is admirable. They simply believe that everything will work out. Not much for making detailed plans, people with Moon in Sagittarius prefer to wing it. They're very adaptable and generally on the go."    Libra Rising:  "Everybody seems to like Libra Ascendant natives. They just come across as nice, pleasant, and fair. Look a little closer at their lives, and these nice people may have had quite a few problems in their relationships. Some of them have had a string of relationships, and it can be hard to imagine why! These natives attract others to them effortlessly. Besides, they simply don't know what to do with themselves without a significant other. Libra rising generally appear to be smoothing everything over. They have charming smiles, a gentle approach with others, and an easygoing image. Even if they were not endowed with good looks, they are attractive. Most pay a lot of attention to their personal appearance -- the colors they wear, their hair, the way they walk.    Libra rising people can be enormously persuasive, although they will almost always use a "soft sell" approach when they want to win others over, which is all of the time! A tendency to pass the buck and keep up that "nice guy/gal" image are their worst qualities. However, they can make excellent mediators and will generally be the first to accommodate you. Libra rising natives are usually attracted to competent, active partners. Their relationships are often characterized by bickering or competitiveness until they learn to drop their sweet image once in a while and to stop blaming their partners for everything that goes wrong."
lJB9ab4Iaa	Ah I loved Anchorage when I lived there, is the Diamond Mall still there or did they finally tear it down?    In any case, he's an Sagittarius with a moon in Taurus (king of like me, except that I'm an Aries with a Taurus moon) so you might have trouble understanding why he doesn't talk about his feelings more, but it's his moon that causes him to be like that. He might also be moody and withdrawn at times, oh and possessive. But his sun sign will probably help balance that out. To find his rising sign you need to know his birth time.|`|xPBv8BDFaa	Sagittarius|`|h3ENq8zVaa	By sun sign, you two are a really good match. But it is not easy knowing his rising and moon sign unless you got his birthtime
PdmSmTYdaa	I don't think it's racist or Nationalist, in these difficult financial times, in fact in any times, employers should openly advertise the jobs and those most qualified should be appointed at a fair rate of pay if jobs are available (British or otherwise). It is not acceptable to go to a foreign workforce for labour purely on the grounds that it is legal & they are cheaper to employ. If companies are allowed to do this then what hope is there for British workforce? The cost of living in the U.K. is high so the pay should be enough to enable a basic quality of life.|`|812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	I think you are confusing racism with zenophobia.|`|Mu7rnIoMaa	You miss the main point.    We (as in our elected politicians) signed up (by joining the EU) to "free" transfer of labour within the EU, the same as someone from Newcastle can work in London.   The lying politicians never told us what his actually meant!    HOWEVER our useless Governments force up our costs by their excessive waste, tax and regulation.   Therefore we are one of the highest cost countries in the EU.    So we cannot complain when fully skilled workers from Italy are signed up by the sub contract Italian company for a job in the UK.  The Italians wage rates are lower than ours, but they are fully skilled having done this work before many times.   One of the reasons the Italian Company got the job (against 4 other EU and 2 other UK bidders) was they are a proven/reliable sub-contractor, probably they were also cheaper.  That is Capitalism at work!    As a contra we have teams of UK workers all round the world in tunnelling work as we are very good at this specialised work!  Should the locals demand these jobs back?       THe REAL solution is for the Government is to make us a high skill low tax economy, than we would actualy be better off in the future without needing excessive wage claims to pay the Government taxes!     Be warned this problem is going to increase.   Gormless Gordon Clown and his useless puppet Darling have borrowed so much money (present rate is every family in the UK now owes 1675,000) that taxes have to rise to start to pay it all back!       So as taxes go up wages demands follow and we end up with even more expensive labour!    I am sorry for the workers at Lindsay but the only solution is one we are not going to get - a new Government that will tell the truth that we must change our ways!|`|ybdNwzMBaa	Its men living in fear of being unemployed,you try and take 500 brits over to Italy and keep the locals at the gate.Sorry but it would not be Peaceful,so once again the Suits in power have got it wrong again.  Gordon Brown talks with Forked tongue British jobs for British workers strange that as that would have broken the law, EU law that is.Just ask our fishermen how EU law works for them so many standing on the stones looking out to sea with Spanish & French in UK waters strange that the UK government did not stand up for them|`|8dhe15MUaa	no it not racist uk jobs for uk lads|`|VfYvJypEaa	Of course it wasn't racist . It's about time we started standing up for ourselves . We should get out of the EU and then we wouldn't have the problem . We'd also be allot better of because we wouldn't have to keep subsidising the rest of Europe .

I wish you could have seen the looks on the boys' faces when they saw me land in front of them!  I have to laugh just thinking about it.  Ruined a darned good pair of nylons too.|`|nMZCQporaa	i walked straight into a bus stop sign because i was talking to someone and was looking the other way. it hurt quite a lot actually :(|`|LX36rMWkaa	All the time. It's kinda one of my traits: clumsiness.    Haha. In 6th grade. we were running the mile and I ran into people, people ran into me and I fell over with a somersault. My head hurt so bad, but when my gym teacher asked if I was alright, I said I was. I continued running. Probably took off 30 seconds of my time. Hahaha...    Also, before the 100 meter dash, I was telling my friend's about what a clutz I was and how I always fall when I run because I have terrible legs. So, when I was running, I crashed into a girl, and fell over. My friends were walking back after they ran it and were laughing at me. So, I laughed it off, got up, and shouted, "Told you!"    I'm a pretty good sprinter. One day, while we were playing a kickball game were the bases were big mats, I decided I would show off by running super-fast. After I kicked the ball, I sprinted to the mat, but it was only ten feet away so I tripped over it and somehow flipped all the way over and landed on my back. When I tried laughing it off, no one laughed. They just all stared at me like I was an idiot. One dude even gave me a cold  glare  and said, "Get up."    Just a couple of weeks ago, I was working in Science class with my crush and he made me laugh so I accidentally hit my head on the wall. We both were laughing really hard.    Another time, I tried to pick up my pencil, but I fell out of my seat.    My friend was spending the night at my house, and she opened my fridge and lightly picked up a bottle of something. I grabbed her from behind and she dropped it. She just didn't do anything and fell over, my hands on her waist. I couldn't hold on to her so I tipped over after her and we both fell down on the kitchen for. lol. We laughed for about 20 minutes.|`|iQOqj2KVaa	LOL Love this question.

It might not sound much but when you see appalling reports on the news about the way children are treated and mistreated, neglected and hurt by the very people who brought them into the world I feel like being a good parent is on the decrease and, I'm not speaking for myself here btw, but why don't we hear things on the news such as "Today a little boy told his mummy that he loved her and not because she bought him something but because she's a nice lady who spends time with him when she can and loves him too, she did not beat him or leave him to starve anywhere"  why no good parenting stories on the news.    oh, i'm 31 btw

Right now I am living with my brother since I lost my job, I dont have anywhere to go since I havent bought anything to support my family with e.g. stove, pots and food enough to last me till month end.I'm being accused of seperating the family, like the other half of the family sits in the dining room while the other half sits in the spare bedroom. I was actually studying in the spare until I fell asleep thats when my daughter joined me and my wife also, now what did I do wrong?

Exv4AjqCaa	Is it really hurting or is it just feeling like theres something in there ?    Like a bubble in your throat yeah ?    Ive had that before from singing & i couldnt get rid of it. Went to sleep and still had it, thought id damaged my throat lol It was just a muscle spasm, you have two little valves in your throat which are normally lightly contracted & relax when you swallow..only to close back up again afterwards.    These can sometimes go into spasm & it creates a feeling of a lump in the throat. If you didnt feel anything wrong before singing theres a good chance you've just made em spasm acidentally. Is your throat hurting because you've been trying to cough it out ? swallowing constantly etc ?   If it is then just try to avoid that, it'll be a bit uncomfortable but just keep eating etc normally. It'll go away.    If its just hurting on its own then it may be something else that you'll want to get checked out.    Links below to find out more about it:|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Visit the ENT doctor as soon as you can, just to rule out the possibility of vocal nodules! It is very important to NOT overuse your vocal chords nor use any wrong singing technique, otherwise you would be jeopardising your singing career!|`|IRFaBtr4aa	You should get it checked out!  This happened to me as well and i got pretty sick (a couple of days of school :D)  It's probably best not to talk/sing like an angel as this will aggravate the pain? Try to eat a lot with a lot of Vitamin C in your diet so your immune system can beat this annoying thing....      Good Luck!!!|`|JGC4XElvaa	It's something you should probably keep tabs on, but you may just be getting sick.  Also, it could be the beginnings of heartburn.  I get it occasionally, and that's how it always starts for me.

I grew up in New Zealand with no one teaching me english so in primary school I was always so confused and when people ask me how long have I been in NZ I just get so imbarassed since I suck at it|`|w4LKvr0daa	French is my first language, but I'm equally fluent in both English and French, because I learned them both at home when I was younger.   When I first started to speak, I used predominantly french, with a few splashings of English and Gaelic mixed in (dad is from ireland).    Now I speak in english more often though, because I live in America, it's just more convenient.|`|AA11854330	Me :)  lol I'm more fluent in my first language.|`|Qq6Y64xuaa	1st language is english  2nd is kannada, (South indian language)|`|AA12400627	I know exactly what you are talking about!

English is my 2nd language and I am more fluent in it than my first language....which is almost forgotten....I am not that fluent in it anymore....but my mother and grandma still talk to me in it....    New Zealand? So you are a Kiwi girl? I hear it's nice there!|`|zs38LPu4aa	I definitely do, nonsense is my first.

I used to read and write in Greek when I was a child, but I gave that up since I just never spent that much time in Greece.  I get by when I go back, but not enough to really feel comfortable.  I picked up English almost immediately as a child, and have loved it passionately ever since.  In speaking, as well as in writing, I try to be grammatically correct.  I would someday like to be able to say the same of the Greek language.|`|goLatkDPaa	Not Me Not I.|`|Li9oemwqaa	English is my first and german is my second sort of - im doing german for my gcse i can sorta speak alright in german|`|1MGXHYq9aa	Most learners of English as a second language, are more proficient than most native speakers, in English grammar.

e654790b992c67caf75978a2190563b1aa	Besides the common sense of not getting married before even getting your independence as an adult I don't think there is a 'right age' to get married.     I personally believe that in order to truly get to know someone and make sure that you're ready to make that huge step of getting married then you must live with the person before doing so. The reason I believe that is b/c even if you two are close and see each other everyday, nothing will ever compare to having to live and combine each others life's, flaws, schedules & habits together under the same roof.     Though to be honest, there are certain couples that simply cannot be married b/c such a big commitment does end up changing their relationship so they instead rather simply live together as a couple.     Having said that, I believe that before I ever even think about marrying someone I must:    * truly love him  * trust him  * be independent  * be confident  * know his family  * live with him  * learn his flaws  * learn his habits    I know many won't agree with me, but this is the way I see myself thinking before marriage.    ^_^|`|f98GMrM2aa	23 exception baby on the way|`|jS6Qkj0faa	i think its overrated.|`|FMJ9H0rjaa	Over 18  But you should feel more than just love for that person.

I call him my husband but were not. Well atleast not yet but might as well be Im 19 and I dont wanna get married till Im at least 30. Idk but thats my opinion though. Expectations and everything else is totally up to the persons. Everyone wants sumthing different.|`|c5anDswjaa	Marriage is hardly special anymore, mostly because of dim witted teens who think that because they are in love with someone after a few months, they should just get married in a rush.. I think a person should be at least be out of high school before they get married or engaged..     Dont get me wrong, sometimes younger people know what they are doing, but most of the marriages/engagements I see are just not genuine and are jumped into too quickly.. Nowadays when I hear that some teen couple is getting married, I just roll my eyes because I get annoyed by it.. Sad but true! I dont think just because youre pregnant that you should marry the person.. To me thats like, "Oh we didnt want to get married but now that we have a kid, I guess were going to have to".. But um yeah, thats all I have to say about that lol|`|1ec5c3ef48df0b4438ce6e3638f0bdeaaa	i think its good as long as women know their place. none of this im getting a job crap or make your own dinner. thats unacceptable.    as far as age i say at least 20    exception no|`|oDMEYSKjaa	marriage to me at first was stupid. I mean, why would you sign a piece of paper, and wearing a ring for other people to know your in love? i mean, friends and family know your in love, thats all.     BUT  My fianc proposed to me and I bawled and now i don't want that ring to come off for any reason. We're going ring shopping this weekend because the wedding is in march. its a small one. Im 20..but will be 21 this year. I've been with him for 3 and a half years, but was best friends with him for 2 years. We are super close.  Marriage is great for 2 people in love. I think they should know the person and dated them for a long time. not 6 months to a year. Pointless.   Atleast 19 and up is good to me anyways|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	I hate that every single person is getting married even though they know they don't love each other and that it's eventually going to fall apart. That's why marriage seems pointless, i mean with 50% of the marriages ending in divorce... what a disappointment. I think they should be at least over 20 years old. I think it's a sacred bond between two people that should only be done when the two of them are both in agreeing to it. No one should be forced to get married because they have a baby on the way, that's definitely a ball and chain.|`|ZuEbNOUeaa	I'm engaged to this girl, so will be happy to see how much more time she needs for her to contact me - its been some time since we've spoken but I think its nice shes being protective on my behalf from her abusive family.

jbAr62ybaa	You seem to have a very wide range of musical tastes.  Experiencing a momentary fascination with "sonic witches" is not unheard of: just enjoy it.         My favorites of classical music composers is also perhaps a little "weird": Wagner, Tchaikovsky and Sibelius.         Here's three respective examples, I don't seem to be able to get enough of:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2qh2QRWI... need to turn up the volume on this one)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mctpTyIBt...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B5_l-yUF...                                                 Cheers,                                                              Alberich|`|j37DL7WLaa	If I had to pick a favorite it would be Bach, but I also love Henry Purcell.  I have favorites in all genres.I don't wish to forget Handel.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Josh--Grobon---hes awesome  http://new.music.yahoo.com/singleVideo/?...|`|FUNsFQEtaa	my favourites are: Bach number one always on the top of my all time hearing playlist!!!    then i love Debussy because of his work in reverie and arabesque, also clair de lune... it gives me such peace    Vivaldi because of the intense use of violin and i adore the sound of it so that gives me chills and fires up my senses when i listen to any of his amazing music    4th is the amazing Tchaikovsky his music is the only one i actually never feel bored from continuous playing, it is just so mesmerizing to hear  i usually do not hum classical music, because it makes others really mad to hear it, and i don't even know how....i really don't understand why some think it's a shame to listen to classicals  i also frequently listen to beethoven, mozart, handel, brahms, mahler and schubert....but to be honest i know none of berlioz, so thank you for pointing him out to me i will certainly check him out|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	Like you, I listen to a wide range of music - including rock. However, I could never say I had a 'favourite' composer. There are so many great ones whose music I admire and enjoy that to pick out just one would be churlish. Because of my role as a pioneer for classical music paths less travelled in my job as a manager in the music profession, my tastes tend to veer towards the weird and obscure. While I do not appreciate the true greats like Bach, Mozart, Mahler and Beethoven any less than my colleagues, I tend to also list composers many more casual listeners might not even recognise. Composers like    Antonio Caldara (contemporary of Vivaldi and composer of some of the most ravishing vocal music ever)  Joseph Martin Kraus (Swedish-based contemporary of Mozart whose music is first rate. Like Haydn in Eszterhza, he was isolated from the main musical circles and this prompted originality)  Vagn Holmboe (the Danish Shostakovich, although his music is more consistently high in quality)  Granville Bantock (English composer, highly regarded by Elgar, of great Straussian symphonies and symphonic poems inspired by Celtic legends)  Frank Bridge (English composer known best as Britten's teacher but a fantastic composer in his own right)  William Schuman (for me, perhaps the greatest American composer but one too often overlooked in favour of more 'popular' contemporaries like Bernstein, Copland and Gershwin)|`|cBPmVudFaa	My favorite composer is Hietor Villa Lobos.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	One thing that many classical music lovers seem have in common is a rather eclectic taste. As fond and enthusiastic about classical music as I am, I still like quality rock and pop music. Love Led Zep, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, etc. Time is the filter for all forms of music and only the truly great survives. (Although I see a future "vacuum" created by music of our current decade.  It is really difficult to say who may favorite composer is... the answer depends on my mood. Sometimes it is Beethoven, at other times Chopin or Mozart. If I am listening to something that I am really enjoying - at that point it is whoever that is. The other day I found myself utterly absorbed by one of Howard Hansons symphonies.  I guess you could say I, like many of the other regular contributors to this forum, are lovers of musical quality. We are the musical Teflon to which none of the huge quantity of inconsequential and trite garbage that is fed to the populus will stick, yet we still retain our appreciation of genius, originality and the ability of some composers to stay fresh after years of listenings.|`|jgEvnYNlaa	I am with you on that. I listen to just about everything and I mean everything. I listen to classic rock like Alice Cooper, Led Zeppelin, Cream, Creedence etc etc    I also listen to heavy metal such as Judas Priest, Megadeth and of course Metallica.     I also love the crooners like Tony Bennett, Frank and others. I love the jazz greats all the way back to swing and forward to Coltrane, Dolphy, Miles, Weather Report and Mahavishnu.     And as far as classical goes, the sky is the limit. You have listed composers that are essential listening. Try some of the composers that are not as popular like Scriabin, Alkan and some of the British composers like Bax.|`|UIg5MxhJaa	I love Tchaikovsky, and Bach. Never enjoyed Mozart terribly much. Of course knowing most of my classical music from conventional sources I know of and like Pachelbel's 'Cannon'. Haven't heard very much of his work though. Another composer I haven't heard much of is Grieg though I adore "In the Hall of the Mountain King" I even wrote something on it for my Humanities class. Though I really have to say I think Handel is incredibly pretentious >:[. And I wouldn't know how much the piece stuck in your head says about you, seeing as my favorite piece is centered around trolls I don't think I can judge. As for other musical tastes I also like rock gospel and classical but I have a large distaste for most country music. (No offense) but most of it sounds the same to me.|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	Hurray for you! My favorites include Bruckner and Sibelius, serious stuff, I'm told. But I have in my Allman Brothersish way performed old Irish folk songs and Waylon Jennings.  (My  1 guitar player was backstage at Johnny Cash concert and asked him if he was going to play any "wailing" tunes, after a thoughtful pause, Johnny said "we might play some Waylon tunes. So I made it a point to learn Waylon tunes for all future requests for "wailing").  Music is music. Hurray for the food of love.|`|45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	My musical taste varies as does yours.  I like all of the classical composers I don't really have a favorite.C.C.R. is great! Bad Moon Rising is my favorite of theirs, Sweet Cherry Wine by Tommy James and the Shondells is also a favorite of mine.I do prefer the older country as compared to today's country music, because when I am in the mood for country I want real country! George Jones 'He stopped loving her today' and I don't remember who sang it 'Statue of a Fool'  are great oldies.I don't like thumbs down as a rule and I wish Yahoo would just do away with them. I have seen many very good answers receive thumbs down.|`|DzLlSt8Paa	you like classic things.......Isn't it?|`|025wasRZaa	It really depends on a matter of taste. Personally, I have a number one favourite: Arthur Sullivan. His 'serious' music is just genius!    But....    Most people tend to go for the famous composers such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin etc. These composers created lovely music but no one seems to realize that there are many other composers who have composed music in the styles of the composers mentioned above. People just pick these composers as their favourites because there the famous ones.    Hm... compositions that give me goose bumps?  I would say that 'Neptune the Mystic' from Holst's 'The Planets' suite gives me goose bumps. It's very...well...mystic! 'Neptune' has sent goose bumps down my spine since I first time I heard the piece (which was about 15 years ago).    As I said, It depends on taste. People have different opinions of music. If people like something that they've heard, they like it. It's as simple as that.    Regards|`|eNVSrvcLaa	Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, chopin and rachmaninov    I don't necessarily like all their music, but some of their pieces are just materpieces.    my favorite piece is probably moments musicaux by rachmaninov|`|6iPCeYbgaa	Your wide range of interest in different kinds of music speaks to your need for diversity in your life, which is so very healthy. Were you to check my 360 Page by clicking on that llittle black and white photo of me, you would see my own musical interests are equally wide spread. I start with Prokofiev, whose way of putting music together makes total sense to me to the extent I will physically stop what I am doing and listen to his music if I am working on something else, and not just sitting back with just music on my mind. Then come the composers for organ: Vierne, Widor, Franck, Alain, Reubke, Mozart, Gigout and my favorite in this category, French composer and organist extraordinaire, Marcel Dupre.     What it says to me is you enjoy music. I like Chaka Khan (while she was with the group Rufus), Tom Waits, Pantera (loud and bizarre; they always clear my sinuses), Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Fletcher Henderson, Larry Clinton (who?), Bix Beiderbecke, Jeff Beck, Donna Summer (from the 80's), Benny Goodman, Fats Waller (wonderful stuff), and you can begin to see I also enjoy a wide spectrum of selections from the world of music. My mother was a piano teacher and my father played the violin, so music was in my family from the moment I was born.|`|PCNsRfJPaa	Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, by Franz Liszt    Best song ever written.

At the top of my wall of fame for composers contributing to the music of the Church is Johann-Sebastian Bach, who wrote numerous Cantatae for the Lutherans.  I excerpted Nrr. 1, 4, and 7 from one Cantata, BWV 140 "Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme" (based on a Philip Nicolai hymn derived from the parable of St. Matthew 25, itself set in the context of a standard Jewish wedding as of the Roman era) for a wedding-processional contingency, as from my perspective BWV 140 Nrr. 1, 4, 7, is far more appropriate for a Christian ceremony than either Mendelssohn's "Incidental Music: Wedding March (from A Midsummer Night's Dream)," Op. 61 No. 9, or Wagner's "Treulich gefhrt ziehet dahin (from Lohengrin)," WWV 75 Nr. 18.    Second is Georg-Friedrich H?ndel, who contributed to Church music both in his native Hannover and later in Great-Britain.  I further developed one of H?ndel's chori, with an additional trumpets-and-drums fanfare based on a tune therein, as an instrumental for a wedding-recessional contingency:  Worthy is the Lamb (from Messiah), HWV 65 Nr. 54.    Others on the wall of fame include Antonin Vivaldi, Dietrich Buxtehde, Franz-Josef Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Carl Philip Emmanuel Bach, and Ludwig von Beethoven.  Many others that contributed to the music of the Church exist but escaped consideration for the wall of fame for want of volume of material.|`|8Y583Fluaa	i am not opposed to classical like some of these others..not my first choice hence i dont know the artists..However, a couple of times i will watch it on TV and watch the action..I can appreciate it more watching it then listening to it.I agree it takes alot of talent and i should listen to it more..i like the fact u have deverisity..Have a great day|`|1wOBfgZIaa	My favorite is Mozart.

n53BNB8taa	Hi scorpio rules 8th house (house of death and rebirth) but that doesn't mean it is the devil's sign.    Most scorpios I have seen are very good, charming and loyal people so it depends on the individual not the sign.|`|nwdwKnS7aa	Scorpio is the sign associated with Death, Rebirth and The Underworld.|`|fyXCunCSaa	Yes, Ive never heard this before. Someones just trying to make a fool of you.|`|FVFg8Fjtaa	Well, don't get me wrong. My boyfriend is a scorpio and I love him dearly. I have nothing against scorps but read the following. I've got it from a website. Sorry, it's a bit long but it's so funny. :D         The Scorpio B*stard... LOL     All those dark, brooding, monosyllabic types, who fill the pages of cheap romantic novels with their strong jaws and piercing eyes, are Scorpios. You know the story: boy meets girl. Boy tortures girl because of a series of very silly misunderstandings and because he enjoys it. Girl becomes a psychological wreck. Boy sweeps girl into his arms and mumbles something about undying love. (He has to sweep her into his arms because by this stage the poor woman has completely fallen apart.). This is where the book ends. There is a very good reason for this. Mills & Boon know what is to come is far too awful to be published. Yet, this paperback ideal of love still manages to override the common sense of most women. We find the strong, silent, manipulative type irresistible. And we sit prettily on our hope chests with our long auburn curls in charming disarray, waiting breathlessly with much fluttering of eyelashes for Scorpio to stride into our lives. (NB: Romantic heroes never walk, they always stride  manfully and purposefully. Its dreadfully tiring for them, and its one of the reasons why they are so moody and irritable.) And once a Scorpio bastard arrives? Well, theres nothing like a spot of good-old-fashioned-bodice-ripping to get things started. Just swoon gracefully into his arms and let him have his wicked way with you. Then have your head examined.     The strong, silent type is what you should look for when purchasing white goods. Whilst these are desirable attributes in a washing machine, you wont enjoy them in Scorpio. He is strong. Much stronger than you. Which means when theres a fight, youll lose. And he is silent. Which means communication within the relationship is going to be a little one-sided. Holding back information is actually one of his favourite pastimes. Mostly because it upsets you. Well, what did you expect? Anyone described as dark and brooding is not going to be a naturally open, caring, sharing person. And Scorpio has a dark side that makes Darth Vader look like Mr. Whippy. As for brooding ability, he leaves Heathcliffe out on the moors: hell hold a grudge against you until the day you die. And your death will only appease him a little. However, youll never even know he has a grudge against you. A Scorpio bastard wont confront you openly. That would be too much like fair play. Hes more likely to watch and wait  decades if necessary  for the chance to launch an attack when youre not paying attention. And when it finally hits, itll make a stealth bomber look weak and clumsy.     Unfortunately, because of the amount of literature (if books featuring Fabio on the cover, count as literature) youve absorbed, youll class all his behavior as normal. Youll revel in all the angst. Being miserable all the time must mean its true love. This is all so romantic. Youll even be flattered by his possessiveness (despite the fact that youre not allowed to go anywhere of see anyone). It means he cant bear to be without you. Of course, he cant bear to be with you either  not when there are still so many things wrong with you.     Hell manipulate you until you become exactly what he wants you to be. Then hell lose respect for you, as youre so easily manipulated. Then hell start looking around for someone else to manipulate. This is when you start looking around too. For reputable psychiatric help. Because, in the midst of torturing you, Scorpio will suddenly turn into a model of gentleness and consideration. Hell even be kind to animals (standard behavior for all romantic hero types  designed to suck you into believing they have a soft, sensitive side). Dont be fooled. Its just part if the callous game hes playing with your mental and emotional health. His objective is to annihilate you. But if he can make you believe he is capable of such an act, it makes it all so much more fun when he actually does destroy you.     And destroy you he will. This is what Scorpio does best. And besides, its how he likes to spend his spare time. Once you are a broken mess on the floor hell pick you up and glue the pieces, so you are whole once more, and he can start all over again. He takes his hobby very seriously. It brings him hours of enjoyment and allows him to explore his destructive talents. And youll get something out of it too. A hobby of your own: a lifelong obsession with him. Which allows you to spend your spare time in expensive 12-step programs undergoing extensive counselling. Check into group therapy when you find yourself getting upset just because he is sleeping with other women. Its really none of your business. You are only his girlfriend / wife / mother of his children. And anyway, youll meet his mistress soon enough when she joins the group after she discovers he is doing the same thing to her. Then you can console each other about your mutual stupidity. Youll both be introduced to a nationwide Unhealthily Obsessed Co-dependant Support Network for Women who have dated Scorpio. It comes with a 24-hour hotline, which youll put to very good use. (This is a free-of-charge service, one of many sponsored by the Aspiring Romantic Novelists Association who use it for research purposes.)     The reason Scorpio inspires such obsessive behavior is because he is so obsessive himself  about sex. He thinks about it twice as much as other men, which basically means its on his mind all the time. Which makes him the blueprint for the complete and utter bastard. Which in turn, makes women think hes sexy. Which therefore means he really cant help but catch one or two of the airborne little-black-dress-clad oestrogen packages|`|h3ENq8zVaa	They said Scorpio is a devil's sign cos when you look at the symbol, it is a M with a devil's tail. That's why they call it a devil's sign|`|l9ph3gBFaa	Because they think with their genitals.  Whoever said it is uptight.

Then at night time I'll shower and wash my hair though i sometimes take two showers at night hahaha *im the reason to the drought :( * ONLY because i have long hair so i do a hair masuqe, i shampoo my hair and then get out and dry off and then put the hair masque on and then 20-30 minutes later i will take another quick shower to rinse it out and then continue to wash my body! My hair is nearly to my butt though and i always style it with product so i need those hair masque's to keep it healthy. But before i even enter the shower i get a clensing wipe and wipe down my face to take off any foundation if i wore makeup that day. I also do an expholiator once a week.

lgdfyIgSaa	Yes, the last class I had to complete before getting my degree in Business Administration was called Legal Environment of Business, and it was only taught from 8:30-1:30 on SATURDAY MORNINGS!!!! AHHH... it was soo terrible. I was taking accounting and economics during the week (2 1/2 hours in each class, two times a week) and the business class on saturdays. I thought I would never be able to make it through my last quarter.    Because at my college we were on the quarter schedule and my class was only taught on saturdays we had 8 weeks to go through 32 chapters, so there was never group discussions and there was never anytime for independent work, it was always lectures. A couple chapters every time we came to class and a test every other week. Our professor would give us a 10 min break after every hour or two. Terrible class to suffer through, but I made it. Woo... haha.    Well good luck with your class!|`|oqzaSJnfaa	Yes, over the phone was sooo long it was like 5 hours lol|`|AA10713007	Yes, only mine lasts from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM and it is hard to stay awake.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Never|`|thcr8Y5vaa	No I haven't...|`|hYqYoYLbaa	yes,maybe he want u guys to get that concept in your mind|`|AA11815233	In his heyday, Fidel Castro used to speak for five or six hours at a time.

I told her it was ok, that I loved her. We healed a relationship that had just about always been strained for reasons that I won't share here. She was more aware & real than I had ever seen her.

5Jf3qA4vaa	YARG!  a curse be upon ye!  are you Australian?  if not, then i understand.  if you are Australian, i suggest you migrate, not because you don't like vegemite but because you posted this question.  i didn't use to like vegemite, i had to eat promite, but now, VEGEMITE IS AWESOME!!! i get up late at night and have vegemite toast.    Dior G Aussies actually like vegemite, or at least a most aussies do. there are plenty that don't, but yeah, it's goood.    apparently vegemite is burnt vegetables... but i don't know ( my "food and hospitality" teacher said so... on the jar it says made from yeast extract)  and you gotta have vegemitew with butter... it doesn't taste as good by itself.|`|CPkW0F4Taa	I LOVE IT|`|FnxgmknUaa	NO !

I understand if you grow up eating it and you love it, that's nice.  But reading the ingredients and how is was developed, made me think it might be a vegetable rendition of caviar, much like cowboy caviar. Which by the way is smushed up black-eyed peas or pinto beans, and it is consumed pretty much the same as the vegemite.  I'd rather have good old peanut butter and jelly.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	I use it to soothe sunburn on my azz cheeks...|`|mMcrqP6caa	I LOVE IT!|`|c78mAitdaa	Nope, i like it.

392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	I'm single,i admire my best friend to have such a great relationship with this  guy,but i don't want a relationship myself.No,you're NOT a loser to be single! You don't have to be in a relationship to  not be a loser!!!! That's just absurd! There are plenty of losers in relationships.....so....yeah,u get my point.I think the question is,how many are HAPPY and content being single? Just because i admire my friend,doesn't mean i want to be involved in a relationship myself.I wanna stay single as much and for as long as i can,because it's a unique part of my life,and probably the best.I've got ALL the freedom in the world i want.Sorry,but a relationship's not freedom anymore,as much as you'd like to think it is.It's not the same.Being single's the best time  of my life and i plan to  prolong it as much as i can.And i'm definitely no loser.:)|`|YHfNA3leaa	I think everyone has someone they admire.  When people ask what your relationship status is, they don't usually say   "I'm crushin"  haha|`|zIMlCnVsaa	I'm single but I'll admit that I admire someone, it's no secret.|`|MWe4hMm1aa	i think everyone secretly admires someone|`|MRwb4jQYaa	They probably do, but it's usually nothing big enough to talk about.|`|LNTWvVuqaa	Nope, some of us KNOW we're losers...and just roll with it.|`|mMcrqP6caa	you don't always have to like someone, some people are genuinely content being single.|`|sWCWrvi2aa	I think everyone secretly admires someone,weather you are taken or single.|`|ZuEbNOUeaa	Yes and shes a Secret.|`|H4GM9kWyaa	Most likely, but it depends on the situation and person.   Can't speak for everyone at all times|`|nMA66AJUaa	That might be true.Some people is able to confess their admiration towards the particular person they admire.Being single means you have lesser responsibilites rather than when you are in a relationship.|`|Qq6Y64xuaa	i think but only on someone

I do curse now and then, I don't mind if others do as well in proper company, but generally those who pepper their every other word so seem to be trying too hard to impress others with how bad they would like you to think they are.    It's just lame.|`|jVZ7HbDsaa	I pretty much NEVER curse... and people who curse purposely really irritate me. Is it out of intentional disrespect? Or do they think they sound "cool"?   I never did understand why things that are viewed as immoral or unjust, to many people in society [particularly young adults] is supposedly "cool"....   I, personally, think it makes them sound pretty rediculous to curse... I think it is weird to WANT to smoke because they see it as something cool to do for whatever reason...    A lot of times I say something a little off-the-wall in place of a curse word.. my oddest one has probably been "Fudgemunky!" 0.o

LrKCLZF7aa	This is talking about the parts of the body that are ruled by each sign.    Aries- Head  Taurus- Neck  Gemini - Shoulders  Cancer- Breasts  Leo - Back  Virgo - Stomach or rather Tummy  Libra - Small of the back and buttocks  Scorpio - sex organs  Sagittarius - Thighs  Capricorn - knees  Aquarius - calves  Pisces - Feet.    These are also supposed to be erogenous zones. In my experience, they don't always work. Like my wife is Virgo, but her erogenous zones are breasts, and shoulder and neck area. I have never aroused her by rubbing her tummy or anything like that.    One other thing is that these also seem to point to the weakness in each sign. For example: Libra starts to feel fatigue is the small of their back first. Capricorn starts to feel in the knees first... etc...    This list is not complete but you get the idea from it.|`|n53BNB8taa	It means the parts which will create feelings during foreplay.

Qc2VO9G9aa	I think it means, don't be scared of something it might seam big, but it will turn out to be  nothing. And when you calm down and take a deep breath you will see there was nothing to be worried about.      (i also believe in horoscopes)    p.s i hope it helped you|`|lJB9ab4Iaa	It's saying that something is bothering you, and instead of dilly-dallying you need to just confront whatever that is, head on.     I love astrology but horoscopes and day-to-day predictions are a bunch of bullhonkey. That's just my opinion though, obviously it's your prerogative to believe what you want.

And making a snowman or tucked up in bed, electric blanket on full blast and a cup of hot chocolate, I'm not complaining ;)|`|1HbJS4hBaa	There is bound to be someone else hating snow, with probability and all.  I love snow, it makes for good sledding.  oh, and the city looks beautiful after a few inches of the white stuff (not coke).  Cleveland needs a little pick-me-up every so often.

Four and twenty blackbirds,   baked in a pie.   When the pie was opened,   the birds began to sing.   Wasn't that a dainty dish   to set before the king?   The king was in his counting house,   counting out his money.   The queen was in the parlour,   eating bread and honey.   The maid was in the garden,   hanging out the clothes,   When down came a blackbird   and snipped off her nose!|`|Hxqk9LoHaa	Just about all of them!    Wee Willie Winkie  Runs through the town,  Upstairs and downstairs  In his nightgown.  Rapping at the windows,  Crying through the lock,  "Are the children all in bed?  For it's now eight o'clock.    Smiling girls, rosy boys,  Come and buy my little toys;  Monkeys made of gingerbread,  And sugar horses painted red.    Mary, Mary, quite contrary,  How does your garden grow?  With silver bells and cockleshells,  And pretty maids all in a row.    The Queen of Hearts,  She made some tarts  All on a summer's day.    The Knave of Hearts,  He stole the tarts  And took them clean away.    The King of Hearts,  Called for the tarts  And beat the Knave full sore.    The Knave of Hearts,  Brought back the tarts  And vowed he'd steal no more.    and as mentioned, Sing A Song of Sixpence.
ZdAT58Mvaa	Usually in musical theatre, the notes aren't as important as the character you give to the song. If you show that you can really put a lot of emotion into the song, you should do fine.    If there's a certain song you have to sing, just keep going over it until it feels comfortable. If you have to pick the song, pick a song you listen to all the time because you'll know it inside and out.    Good Luck!|`|8478b8de7e84637d2b4117c1696b3343aa	Don't show up for the audition .

MWe4hMm1aa	definitely. i just can't enjoy it no matter how good the song is. but it's rare that i feel like this.|`|P8uh4joQaa	not anymore but at one point in time I was. I'd just lay on my bed and stare at the ceiling thinking until I finally passed out.|`|5AaV7koHaa	That is a good time to turn on the Home Shopping Channel, curl up in the bed and snooze.|`|9xgGd9praa	I don't do that new cool in thing, you know, "The Depressed And Alone Teenager."|`|CRuxWsi0aa	Yeah, it happens sometimes. But then I take a 16 hour nap and listen to some more Alk. Trio|`|AA12151161	I love music, very seldom do I not have it playing wherever i was.

To me, music is more important than life.|`|Cb6aKYuWaa	Ya it happens quite often with me whenever I come out of the meeting room.|`|rypRuoGsaa	Yes I have been there and done that, (not at all a good feeling).

I am very depressed today.    Nobody wants me.|`|1gFxxJsBaa	ya me too.|`|bc2f9034a51968f2b5ca5dec19dc698caa	Usually, I turn to music, but there are those rare times when the music makes me more depressed, annoyed, or just uncomfortable. During those times I sometimes try to focus on things that need done, read something, or just give up for the day and go to sleep.    When it gets to the point where I realize that there is NO WAY I will feel okay that day, I know that going to sleep is the best option. In the morning, I am almost always in a better mood, and I have a level head, so I don't despair so much.|`|kL6yQ5s2aa	Yes,strange but true.|`|qCCn17DRaa	yeah, have been sometimes|`|sWCWrvi2aa	I use to get that way when i was with my ex boyfriend. We would get in a fight or break up and every song that came on would make me think of him so and i would get really really sad so i would turn it off. I love to listen to music so it was kinda odd for me to do that. Also when my grandma passed away i had to turn it off.|`|t1inn1nLaa	yes, many time    I'm depressed and I'm not in the mood for happy songs, but sad songs makes me even more depress, some songs are so depressing.|`|oUiVckg2aa	i listen to the song that best describes my feeling for the moment. and after i lash out my anger or cry buckets of tears, i get up and start my life again.|`|7rtu5n1taa	One time I was so depressed that I prayed to God to end my life. The reason I didn't kill myself was that I didn't want to go to hell. But I lived through it and now my life is good.|`|Qq6Y64xuaa	yes, especially today i am depressed|`|R7smL5mQaa	I suffer from depression and before I was prescribed my medication I didn't have any energy to do anything, all I could do was sleep and then sleep some more, it was scary!!|`|Jgc7S1ffaa	Yes, music is a mood killer!|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	If something goes wrong, yes.  Then I pick myself up and get back in the race.  That's life. Get up.  Have a good day!

1PdUecpYaa	he's a softie, but less wishy washy than other pisces because his moon sign is taurus.   his venus is in aries, just like me. that means he falls in love easily and falls out of love just as easily. keep flirting with him, he likes the chase. but his mars is in virgo so it might take him awhile to make the first move because he wants everything to be perfect. he might be a bit nervous, anxious and fidgety around you if he likes you.|`|7eI0kW5Uaa	i hate pisces;  their so like ... trying to make people like you,  by stucking up.     heres information about pieces  http://my.horoscope.com/getHoroscope.asp...|`|7oXWJSZ1aa	pisces are twitchy. a lot of mood swings but they also tend to keep their emotions to themselves.|`|jNiCHwamaa	They are such romantics! and they are very generous.

OW1pCxU1aa	A lot of good points made on this already.  Yes, as the water rises, she could keep herself afloat, especially since she could use the interior wall as leverage, but that would get tiring after a long period of time.  I dont know how much rain you could expect to get, but it would take a lot to fill up the pit (a lot of water would absorb into the dirt), so you that could mean you could be stuck floating for quite some time.  Also, she had a newborn plus her son to keep from drowning.  It would make for a stressful time.  Of course, I dont know about her rock climbing stint - quite the dangerous choice being that she was ready to give birth.  Where's Chuck Norris when you need him?|`|D8sN8gNFaa	She probably wasn't good at treading water, plus she was in labour if you missed that part of it.|`|XSBsomfVaa	I know this movie like the back of my hand.    Anyway, the woman was pregnant and had her son on her shoulders. The weight would have been too much for her.|`|Ddb5821Jaa	YES, you could. and that part annoyed me as well. I spent endless hours at the pool and I think you could swim (esp if its life threating) for many many hours. esp that there was rock, mud roots on the walls.   and the fact she had a baby in it? crazy movie stuff.|`|bda465ikaa	The cisterns in the Yucatan probably wouldn't fill up to the top. Plus she had the baby and there were people waiting at the top ready to kill her.  -If it filled up three feet from the top she after treading water for hours, it is unlikely that she could push the kid out and then crawl up a vine.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	It's only a movie.   You try it alone.   Good luck!|`|y8WBcehmaa	as it's slowly filling up, you would get tired of paddling and drown. You can't swim forever.|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	She was pregnant, and she had a little boy with her. The pit was too deep, it would have to rain non-stop for a long time in order for it to fill up for her to float to the top.    Awesome movie.|`|AA11066475	who knows if she knows HOW to swim an even if she does..she has a little one she has to try keep afloat as well

HxAyoEQVaa	BOTH LOOK LIKE **** IN THE MORNING|`|39OVFs5Raa	I agree about the men!  Only women who sleep with their make up on seem to deteriorate during the night!!!.|`|9xgGd9praa	That's not true at all.  Obviously you've never experienced Coyote Ugly with a male.|`|d0e1b5b2af884d02c8c1a86fcdf900caaa	I agreed with your last one, but I don't agree with this one. Men and women both wake up looking different, and if for some reason a woman looks worse, it's because during the day, her hair is brushed out, make up on, looking great. Just because men don't wear make up doesn't mean they wake up looking the same, lol|`|L4LPVtgfaa	Maybe you should make a bit more effort if you do absolutely nothing to improve yourself in the morning.     In regards to the women, it's not so much deterorating it'a just going back to the natural look :)

xFSXryiaaa	is she gay?  i didn't know she was gay?  i thought she was just ur fantasy!
xFSXryiaaa	I wish to point out that Mr. [shred] 1) failed to answer the question, and 2) committed two grammatical errors.  Both of the errors were of a similar nature, specifically that an object pronoun did not agree in number with its antecedent.  In the first error, the plural "them" does not agree with the singular "female". In the second error, the plural "them" does not agree with the singular "someone".  For future reference, Mr. [shred], please be advised that we Y!Ahoos frown upon grammatical errors!  ;-)    to answer your question sarahs sn, lily allen ain't my cuppa-t but i like her music and she looks cute in a few pix that ive seen and id say she looks hot in the smile video.  singers id much rather do include amy lee or regina spektor or beyonce or it b eve or moesha or missy elliott or nelina or syleena johnson or renee fleming or nina hagen or denyce graves or paulina rubio or natalie oreiro or thalia sodi or gulsen or skye sweetnam or kylie minogue or celis or nokko or jennifer hudson or my all time fave pepa!|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Thanks for sharing your umm, unnecessary sexual desires to have intercourse with Lily. A little TMI in my opinion.    These are things you should write in your diary and keep them to yourself just like Katy Perry and her lesbian sexual innuendos.    Hence, "I kissed a girl and I liked it"    No just because a female is sexy, talented and famous doesn't trigger me to want to "do them." I prefer getting to know someone first and become comfortable with them. An average citizen is just as much as a candidate than any other female I am not a Status Seeker|`|MPba9IUBaa	im straight but i think shes pretty|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Good point shred...|`|C7YbYUYPaa	With all due respect to shred, I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating crackers.

It didn't get alot of hype at all, but it's just a great film.  It's got great symbolism in it, and the plot is some harsh reality really.  I enjoy it, even though no one else has heard of it.  Another independent film is Wildflowers.  It follows a young girl that glamorizes an older woman she finds.  The woman later is connected to the girl in a slightly unexpected way.  It's about the money.  That's really what it is.  If you don't have big names in the cast and you don't have money to promote the movie, then you are sunk.|`|AA11041009	Jon Favreau's "Made."      Folks were disappointed, but I thought this follow-up on "Swingers" was hilarious.
cTYhnumDaa	the triple entant and the other which for remembering I call the GAI alliance as it's made of up of Germany, austria and Italy. The triple entant is made up of britain, russia and France and these were the peaceful side, the GAI alliance was defensive so if one of them were to be attacked this would mean they would have back up by the other two countries.    Britain had the biggest navy but was feeling intimidated as Germany started building a navy with dreadnoughts although they arn't exactly surrounded by water unlike britain who needed a huge navy to cover all the way around it.    Britain had a huge empire.    Serbia assassinated Austria's leader and as Serbia was beginning to get a larger empire Austria was scared so they went to Germany (I think) for support as their army wasn't that big.    I dont know much more, we only just started it in history :P|`|syBq8Yllaa	was originally named the Great War...we declared it on April 6, 1917...my bday|`|oKyimeaMaa	started with the assassination of Duke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, where Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia    Serbia asked Russia for help, Russia started to mobilize, then Germany declared war, and so on with Great Britain and France and other major European powers..........and then the United States stepped in about 2-3 years later after Germany removed their restriction of submarine warfare and also when the Zimmerman telegram was discovered, which mentioned that Germany wanted Mexico to go to war with the United States as a distraction for Germany so that the U.S. doesn't interfere with Europe....    Germany surrenders and an armistice is called for, and Germany and its allies agree to reparations, or amends for wrong doing...|`|NrbLdZzOaa	Do your own homework...|`|Xxn7DssEaa	there was war|`|5Jf3qA4vaa	this is all from memory, which is not in the mood to remember WW1, so details may be a little dodgy.  it started in 1914 and ended 1918.  it started because a polish ambassador was assasinated. (i think he was polish, maybe not an ambassador).  anyway, all the allies of poland and (austria?) got drawn into it, eventually dragging America, England and Australia into war.  Australian troops were seen as "undisciplined" and were basically used as cannon fodder in Gallipoli. (good movie, Gallipoli, Mel Gibson)  ...mm... i might have to get back to you on this one...|`|E9ZLxgsOaa	Wasn't that the one of the ones  John McCain fought in.|`|UbTHwP0Faa	They shot Prince whats-his-name in Sarajevo.

I'll name one, it's called The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold. It is the story of a teenage girl who, after being brutally raped and murdered, watches from heaven as her family and friends go on with their lives, while she herself comes to terms with her own death. The novel received a great deal of critical praise and became an instant bestseller. It's a great book and I think they are making a movie for it.

Ugh! But I actually like Rhianna much better than Beyonce. Beyonce is HIGHLY overrated. She was only good with Destiny's Child!    Forever is right. Katy Perry and her lesbian song are overrated.

Then theres:  Fall out Boy,  You me at six,  Miley and her disney crew,  The Kooks (not that they're not an alright band),  Oasis (love them but still.)|`|3EiWXsieaa	oh geez.  all mainstream pop crap is overrated.  it always will be.  i mean, come on, seriously?

NrSBtEYuaa	Aries and Gemini are sextile to each other.Moreover the air of Gemini fans the fire of Aries.The two get along well generally.Thus your two Sun-signs are compatible.  The ascendants Leo and Libra too are fire and air as also sextile to each other.So as above,compatible.I am a Leo and have got along well with most Libras all my life.  The Moonsigns Virgo and Sagittarius are square to each other.More so one is fire and the other earth.These are said to be not very compatible.  As indicated above the two Venus's are also compatible being in Aries and Gemini.I cannot however help pointing out to you here that what should be compared is the man's Mars and the female's Venus as Mars is indicative of male sex vigor and Venus the female sex vigor.    On the basis of the data given by you i would consider the match fairly compatible.|`|pxdEpIZAaa	I'm and Aries and my boyfriend is a Gemini. we've been together for 5 years and go great together. Let me tell you though, you are in for a surprise, because I thought the whole "twins" thing about Geminis being like 2 people living in one body wasn't actually true, But it is. Which isn't a bad thing as long as you get along with both of them. as far as compatibility goes, I did some research and everything i seemed to find was negative, so from experience I think that there are always exceptions. I guess you just have to try it out and see where it takes you.|`|TDVGgRAWaa	I think it should work 'coz suns, risings and venus are matching.  Air with fire is fine.  But moons are not matching. Moon is your emotions and emotions are needed to bond fully.

2WFzTTAzaa	I don't have kids, but you could always give them a cheapo prepaid phone without a camera and the bare minimum features instead of the premium service package so they can't send texts.  They'll probably still be able to receive them though.|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	dude not everyone does that I'm 15 and I don't do that its just wrong in so many levels XP|`|sVrkjixAaa	The percentage of teenagers who actually send nude pictures to each other is so small its irrelevant when talking about the need to text.     And yes, texting is a distraction in class, but if we want to pay attention in class we will. If we don't want to, we won't, regardless of what options we have. It's good that your being protective of your kids, but think about it. If they actually wanted to send sexual messages to other people, there's phone calls, emails with picture attachments, instant messenger, facebook, myspace, and actually doing things in person.|`|tG9Y6JZxaa	My kids ages are as follow  Daughter 1 age 13  Daughter 2 just turned 12 today  Daughter 3 10  and LAST but not least son 8.

She is on prepaid.     My other kids DO NOT have a cell phone.  My 13 year old wants one, but she is not mature enough to own one at this time.

Anyway, I believe that texts are necessary now days, younger generations usually communicate with text alone so it would be a bit hard for your children to communicate by calling alone. For example, lets say my friend texts me asking about a yes or no question. Wouldn't it be awkward if I called him back just to say yes or no?|`|Px4bxDtYaa	lol na|`|IrdZKYT3aa	I've had a cell since freshman year and never pulled nay stunts like this, and neither did anyone I hung with.  However...it wasn't uncommon to see one of the boys stick their hand through the cut out square in the back of a seat to get an "up skirt" shot of a girl sitting down.  The girls knew, would playfully shriek and laugh...whatever, I'd have hit the roof if that had been done to me.  Different strokes and all that.  Now, years later, I see my littlest bro taking pics of him self shirtless, flexing his "abs" and what not, making a general fool of himself.  Honestly, I think it's your maturity level.  My other brother, the middle child, would never pull a stunt like that.  I practically expect nothing more from the youngest, *shrug* some people are just more mature than others no matter how old they actually are.  You know what would be great?  Set up some sort of test, like  a drivers test that they'd have to do with weekend school and everything before they get one.   But really, people are going to be who they are.  Some can handle the responsibility and some can't.  I really think a parent should think more about that before giving their child a cell phone, it comes down more to individual policing than a mass blanket order.
YwtXSUAdaa	I must be missing something. They never got a new guitarist, they got a new bassist when Cliff Burton died.... and that was in 1986. Jason Newstead was on ...And Justice For All in 1988 so that had nothing to do with it.    They started to head in a more mainstream direction to gain a wider and more general fanbase so that they could up their profit. It worked since the Black Album is their highest selling album ever.    That just goes to show, don't make music how you like and want..... make it more mainstream and make more money.    The guy above me makes a decent point though.... Burton did have a huge influence on their music and writing so...    - No problem dude.    Edit: Dude below me's an *** don't worry about him.|`|OLCoFKQraa	Well I like both volumes of 'Load', there was nothing wrong with it, for what it was (blues rock) it was quite good, but you know, to me it feels like Metallica were too old to rock 5 years ago.   After the black album I think their taste in music changed, that's all, maybe they got sick of playing metal, I dunno.    (edit) There's more to life than Metallica, I've got about 300 albums almost all of which are heavy metal, and almost all of which were made in the last 15 years, there is SOOO much excellent music out there if you care to venture further than MTV.|`|nMA66AJUaa	Metallica great albums were Kill em all,Ride the lightning and Master of puppets.The construction of the songs,lyrics,riffs etc from those 3 albums were significantly amazing.Till this very day,a lot of guitar players love to do cover songs from those 3 albums.It was only after Cliff Burton's departure which let their music evolved.It was Cliff who reminded them to keep their feet on the ground and kept Metallica together.    Black album was the greatest selling album in their career.It is from there they began to play more mainstream to be accepted the mainstream society.After the black album,Load,Reload and so other albums I feel that they were experimenting on their sound and taste of their music because they knew that they were already Kings of the Heavy Metal or giants of the big 4.Anthrax,Megadeth and Slayer.    It is said as you age, your voice changes especially if you're a singer.James still sounds good to me but i loved his voice during his prime time.It was really rough.    Correct me if im wrong.|`|tyTJE8vxaa	You both need a history lesson....Dave Mustaine was the original guitarist, and played on 2 or 3 demos in 82/83, before they replaced him with Hammett in 84    As for what happened after the black album...I think Load was a decent album, but after that they sort of hit a creative roadblock and strayed a little bit from their metal roots that made them popular in the first place (Reload had a lot more "ballads" on it, Garage Days was all covers etc) and have just really struggled to recapture that same early sound ever since (which is understandable after 25 or so years, I guess!)|`|Lngb8ryFaa	nothing happened to them after the Black album...do you people realize that they are 25+ years into their career?? what other legends kept putting out albums as great as their early ones 25 years later?? sabbath didnt, pink floyd didnt, the rolling stones didnt...i dont know why people hold metallica to such high standards this late in their career, in fact the standards are so high that no matter what they do they couldnt live up to them...|`|umhjqZwLaa	ok son you need a history lesson.kirk has been the guitarist since1984.james's voice is better than ever,and after the black album they decided they needed to make real music instead of cookie cutter metal.because of that your generation became fans.|`|JXTLpgUoaa	Probably a loss of the creative influence of Cliff Burton. Not only was he and incredible bass player he also was credited a lot as a songwriter / composer of many of their great songs.  Even ... And Justice for All, which was released after his death, had a lot of his work in it.

6xC1kCdLaa	I know there are several websites that have downloadable movie quotes. I was recently looking for a specific quote from the movie 300, so I searched something along the lines of "300 movie quotes, mp3" and got several results. If you can't find it that way, you can try and find a clip from the movie on something like Youtube, download the video, than extract the audio through imovie or another program. Good luck|`|OZJuOio7aa	Patrick B is right - you can find trailers with the appropriate lines on youtube, and then use an audio editing program to make an mp3 file of just the audio. I've done this using Audacity (a very basic, free program) and it worked great!

vGWD8Zncaa	That's one of the most FALSE statements I've EVER heard!    While it might be said "only boring people find themselves with nothing to do", the fact is, the most intelligent and especially most creative people among us are the ones who get bored out of their minds the easiest and most quickly when faced with sustained-attention tasks!    It's usually the comparatively boring who can manage to do boring or repetitive tasks for long periods of time without getting bored.    The more fertile and active the mind, the more easily it gets bored.    We all have to do boring tasks from time to time and the creatively brilliant will be the most bored of them all.|`|MCOlkzk6aa	yes I do agree and I am not boring.  Who called me that?

8tWub9HMaa	ok so, i wondered the same thing. lol! actually as far as relationship stuff goes, and horascopes in general, i like the chinese ones better. to me they capture my personality better, while the other ones dont as well. while normal horoscope goes by month, and chinese by year, its different. they could technically conflict. i mean, they can be perfect for each other in the regular horoscopes, but then in the chinese one not be the right year to be a perfect match. hahah its funny. but for me the chinese one is dead on for me. lol. ^^|`|730505ecff4ca4830fd44af63217fb37aa	As far as I know, horoscopes are for the month one is born in and Chinese horoscopes are for the years. And I don't think that the relationship compatibility is similar... It might though, because like I said, Chinese horoscopes are for the years and horoscopes for the months.|`|DmXexkZdaa	Ha ha ha, my beloved was a skeptic. I actually believe that astrology (all kinds) do play a major role, all though not all of it. My darling and I are supposed to be complete opposites in both American and Chinese. I'm a Libra-Dragon and he's a Scorpio-Rabbit (he's 11 months older then me). All the books I read said that Libras and Scorpios are too opposite to actually get along; same said with our Chinese couterparts. However, I see being opposite as a strength then an weakness. It allows us to mature and bond into each other instead of falling apart.|`|GWna2slVaa	The Chinese horoscopes go by the year the person was born, unlike the other that goes by month.    So there's a chance that a couple were born in the same year, just with different, opposing signs in the Western zodiac, that could lead to a difficult relationship.    I don't think they correspond because of the month vs year difference

vH2OF9z8aa	i think they are right,    ): Hard times brought on by addiction, wasteful spending, ill health, or an outside event. Rejection, loneliness, and the need for comfort.

This is the poetry or voice of the undertaking. 5 Anfore (Disappointment): Suffering a loss and wishing for what might have been. Being crippled by sadness, grief, and vain regret. Indecision brought on by the feeling that you made the wrong choice. Ignoring what you still have. May suggest a broken relationship or tragedy.

The card on the left represents emotion - the feelings aroused by or surrounding the ideation of the project that takes place in the previous card. This is the music or scent of the undertaking. Regina di Dischi (Queen of Discs): The essence of earth behaving as water, such as a hot spring: A warm and generous host, providing shelter and comfort for all who would seek it. A person steadfast, practical, and domestic, able to create opulence and stability in any setting. The qualities of maturity and sensibility, coupled with an innate appreciation for nature and the material world.    The card on the bottom represents thought - the analytical process of organizing the project and capturing the emotional content of the previous card. This is the science or vision of the undertaking. 1 Anfore (Ace of Cups): The seed of a new relationship or spiritual journey - perhaps as yet unseen. An opportunity for joy, contentment, fertility, or enlightenment. Coming to understand the emotional needs of those around you. May represent an unexpected message, a chance meeting, or the start of a friendship or romance.    The card on the right represents manifestation - the real work involved in completing the project, and the form it will take upon culmination. This is the painting or touch of the undertaking. Carbone (The Hanged Man): Pausing to reflect. Surrendering to an experience. Adjusting to new ideas through sacrifice. Opening oneself to intuition and enhanced awareness. Letting go of past patterns and growing beyond them. Inner peace, faith, and serenity.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	Well, there are good things and bad. The bad thing is that you have a heartbreak clash with him. This is the worst aspect you can have with him. There are signs of true love but it doesn't seem to be that great. One great thing is that you two create a grand trine together.    So no. I would have to say that you are not soul mates.|`|7oXWJSZ1aa	no dear. your not. soul mates are  special and will wait for each other. neither of you did that. that's why soul mates are a mystery. that's why we wish to see in ourselves, that which is in someone else. because most of us will never know what true love is.

4kEuzSpkaa	It would depend how it was done. The Krotons were a bit rubbish back in 1969, but with today's special effects and production values they could be made rather more interesting, believable and scary perhaps.    Apparently, there are plans to bring back the Nimon for one of the 2009 specials, and to be perfectly honest the Nimon were one of the most badly realised monsters ever to appear on Doctor Who. I would go as far as to say they were laughable in fact. The concept of a parasitic alien species which goes from planet to planet, stripping their resources and leaving them devastated is a good one, however, and hopefully will be done much better than in the 1970s. I would say it could be a similar situation with the Krotons.    There are certainly better and more iconic DW monsters I would like to see return, however, before the Krotons were considered. E.g. The Ice Warriors, The Great Intelligence and the Yeti, The Sea Devils and Silurians, and possibly the Zygons.|`|198642e2b6a641fb943c1346409924d9aa	I hope not, it's the one video I've never got to the end of because I always fall asleep !

u23sua9daa	Ablutophobia is a phobia which centers around cleaning, washing, or bathing. It is most prevalent in women and children, although anyone can develop this phobia. As one might imagine, the fear of washing or bathing can have some serious social consequences, making circumstances for someone with this phobia extremely difficult. Fortunately, true ablutophobia is quite rare, and there are a number of treatment approaches which can be used to address it. Ablutophobia help is rarely far away for people who are serious about combating their phobia.    Like other phobias, ablutophobia originates in the subconscious mind as a response to trauma. Someone who almost drowned in the tub, for example, might develop ablutophobia. This phobia can also arise in response to hearing about or seeing someone else's trauma, as for instance in the case of a young child who reads a book with a frightening bathing scene. Over time, the phobia tends to become more severe, as the patient works up more and more stress and tension about bathing, washing, or cleaning.    People with ablutophobia can experience a variety of symptoms when they are in situations where bathing or cleaning arise. They may feel nauseous, sweaty, fearful, shaky, or dizzy. Some experience panic attacks, which can include shortness of breath, high blood pressure, and a rapid heart rate. Feelings of shame are also not uncommon, since many cultures place a heavy value on cleanliness, and refusing to bathe can make someone the target of mockery or teasing, which can increase the severity of the phobia.    Many children experience mild ablutophobia, which usually dissipates as they learn that nothing too terrible happens in the tub. However, if parents force their children into the tub or they are rough with them at bath time, the children can start to link bathing with unhappiness, and develop a more severe form of ablutophobia. Making children comfortable in the bath by checking the temperature, acting relaxed, and not forcing the issue can help to prevent the emergence of ablutophobia in a child.    People with full-blown ablutophobia can get help from a psychological professional. Ablutophobia treatments can involve things like desensitization, in which the patient cleans or bathes under the supervision of a therapist who helps the patient cope with the intense association emotions, and the use of hypnosis and talk therapy. Some patients benefit from psychiatric drugs which help blunt their response until they manage to overcome their fear of bathing.|`|Jgc7S1ffaa	Popeye's fear of being beaten up by his rival, Bluto!|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	Fear of Abluto's.|`|dk8y4eseaa	fear of taking a bath. haha|`|MRwb4jQYaa	Ablutophobia (from Greek: ebliUt, ablute, meaning to wash) is the persistent, abnormal and unwarranted fear of bathing, washing, or cleaning.

Ablutophobia tends to be more common in children and women than in men and especially with those people who are very emotional.[1]|`|AA12151161	Here is a website that may help:    http://www.phobialist.com/    Ablutophobia- Fear of washing or bathing.|`|CiNTpfvMaa	Just a fear of washing.|`|sRGPj46eaa	fear of heights|`|N4elimNRaa	LOLLLL.  you blaitz to havee it.  you told me you do.|`|zs38LPu4aa	the fear of getting hit in the stomach muscles with medievil string instruments

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	Let It Be - I had a very dark time in my life when I was addicted to drugs, and this song would always help me calm down my mind and relax and stop being paranoid and wiggy about things.    Across The Universe - This song evokes a lot of emotion about our own mortality, death, and eternal life in a better place, the continuance of the spirit long past the ending of the physical body.     Octopus's Garden - Just a cute, silly love song by Ringo. All his songs are so lighthearted and fun in comparison to some of the heavy emotions of Paul and John's songs.    The Long and Winding Road - Beautiful love song that translates the deep feelings associated with knowing that a certain person is the only thing on earth you want and need.     Yellow Submarine - This song is just plain fun, no matter who you are.|`|TpG59Lpjaa	1. I've Just Seen A Face - It's really happy and cheerful and has an excellent use of acoustic guitars -George Harrison FTW!!!    2. Helter Skelter - Really grungy and really fun to play on guitar.    3. From Me To You - My favourite early pop song, seriously catchy :D Awesome solo too.    4. I'm Happy Just To Dance With You - Again, GEORGE HARRISON!!! lol It's a really edgy strumming pattern and it works great.    5.Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey - Early psychadelia!!! Strange|`|qLg6faHBaa	Lucy in the sky with Diamonds - because it always gives me a beautiful image XD  Hey Jude - because my classics teacher is called Judy and it reminds of her! She lets us call her Hey Jude and it reminds when I have an essay due or something!  Yesterday - because although it is sad it is a really nice song and I love listening to it!  Money can't buy you love! - Not really a reason its just an amazing song!  Eleanor Rigby - because not only is it a good song but I can relate to it. It invokes a range of emotions and also my brother used to sing it all the time so now he has gone it reminds me off him!|`|pEN9NmcJaa	1. If i fell in love with you  2. In my life  3.

wz8gx3gaaa	It is a block buster around the world and profit wise it is in Top-5 Hollywood movie.

hJP9y6kjaa	Not necessarily.    In fact, with Dm, you definitely wouldn't play C . Dm = F major, and the key signature there is 1 flat, or B -> Bb.    Let's see... keys of D major, A major, E major, and B major all have at least two sharps, and so would therefore have C -> C . That would correspond to B minor, F  minor, C  minor, and G  minor.     Time to bone up on your circle of fifths... try googling "circle of fiths transposition", see if that helps.    The idea is that there is a progression of sharps (F, C, G, etc) and a progression of flats (B, E, A, etc), and these are determined by how the key relates to C major. For instance, going fifthwise from C (G major, D major, etc) you add sharps, going fourthwise from C (F major, Bb major, etc) you add flats, following the progressions mentioned earlier.    I have no idea if that made sense. You can email me if you need clarification, or there's always Google. Good luck!

I watched it and liked it.I kinda like films where things start pretty normal and then spin further and further out of control and there were some great twists and turns in it.

I can understand some people not liking it though as it not a film for everyone and there aren't too many like-able characters in it..|`|VqVOlvxtaa	I was so excited to see it because I love Woody Allen movies and Jonothan Rhys Meyers is smoking hot, but yes, major disapointment.

WUnEENDQaa	i think this may wrap up around the time of ej/nicole's "wedding".  and i think the key players will involve mia- she's began calling nicole already.  rafe- he may factor in by putting some clues together (remember he went to the mansion as the 'cable guy').    also tony has been suspicious, ej or stefano themselves.  maybe even brady may be a key person to figure all this out.|`|TkUF1PI4aa	Who knows. You know how Days just LOVES to drag on plots/stories. Let's just hope it doesn't last as long as other scandals & once again I am sick of the baby switching & fake pregnancy storyline. Haven't we had enough. poor Lucas (even though he's a clueless jerk), Elvis (whooped) & Poor Sami. Nicole does NOT deserve to be a mother Period!|`|u4Zu2v0Paa	Getting old?  She just had her baby switched a few days ago, give her time to even suspect.  Sami and Rafe make a better couple than Sami and EJ.|`|kELOzS8Faa	Sami is an idiot! She doesn't belong with anyone.|`|C4knGt7Iaa	I hope it'll be soon 'cos I can't STAND Nicole.  And at one time, I loved Sami & EJ but now, I REALLY like Sami & Rafe.  Never liked Sami with Lucas.  I don't like Lucas with anyone.  Ick!  Especially not Chloe.  Blech!

jnEdjmsTaa	He finally gave in to his friend's girlfriend when she said "there's someone you should meet"  At a crowded restaurant way cross town, he waited impatiently  When she walked in, their eyes met,  And they both stared  Right there and then,  Everyone else disappeared, but    Chorus    One boy, one girl,  Two hearts beating wildly,  To put it mildly, it was love at first sight.  He smiled, she smiled, and they knew right away  This was the day they'd been waiting for all their lives.  For a moment the whole world  Revolved around one boy, and one girl    In no time at all, they were standing there in the front of a little church  Among their friends and family, repeating those sacred words.  The preacher said "son, kiss your bride"  And he raised her veil  Like the night they met,  Time just stood still, for    Chorus    He was holding her hand when the doctor looked up and grinned,  "Congratulations, twins"    One boy, one girl  Two hearts beating wildly  To put it mildly, it was love at first sight.  He smiled, she smiled, and they knew right away  This was the day they'd been waiting for all their lives,  And for a moment the whole world,  Revolved around one boy, and one girl

Also, try anything by Apocalyptica, they cover rock bands and they are a rock orchestra, they are really awesome.

39OVFs5Raa	This is a true story (a few years ago), but I have to admit I myself would not have believed it if it didn't happen to me... I was in a hurry to get to a 9-o'clock meeting in the office, but unfortunately was driving an old car that had a tendency to choke up and die on me every once in a while. It took me about 30 minutes to restart the engine whenever it turned itself off. That day I got to the parking lot just a tiny bit too late (as usual), and in my hurry decided to try and get into a very tight parking spot instead of looking for another one. I did manage to get in, leaving less than an inch between my car and the car parked on each side, when, of course, the engine died... and wouldn't start up again. There was no way I could open any of the car doors, and there was nothing much to do but sit there, locked in the car, knowing everyone at the meeting I was supposed to lead wondering what happened to me, feeling absolutely ridiculous. Only 20 minutes later someone walked by and I yelled out to him to come over, on hearing my sorry plight he got a few other guys to push my car out.  I finally managed to climb out... I was laughing so hard when I finally made it to the meeting, that the other attendees forgot all their anger. Incidentally, I sold that car a few months later!!!.|`|2LDtSDMuaa	me and my sisters kidnapped my cousin on her birthday and took her to get ice cream.  hahah it was really retarded though, because we kept laughing and when we went in her house to get her, she saw us lol, sooo she knew it was.  but it was hilarious.|`|nRtf72u8aa	Im the prankster in the family so lately ive been scaring my mom with fake roaches cause she hates em (who doesnt) & when she's not lookin I place em where ever shes at & spook her PLUS I capture it on video...LMAO!  she falls for it everytime & her screams are hilarious...once I have em all im gona edit it & post it on Youtube lol!  its to freakin funny...lol!

SkRJNhuCaa	The GRX is just a GRG relabelled for inclusion in a beginner's kit.    They're not very good instruments, either of them. But if you like heavy distortion rock you'll probably like the sound.    As an alternative look at the GSA. I prefer the SA overall to the RG (sound, shape, size, weight are all better for me).    But also look seriously at spending a bit more and getting a real RG or SA.  They're far superior instruments.

She was clearly in love with herself and wanted to make a name for herself.  They should have kept her around a little longer though, at least one more show.  I loved Simon and Randy's response to her.  She could do no wrong.  Funny stuff.|`|AA11105507	Not at all.  She never even should have made it to Hollywood to begin with.  Kara does not need to be insecure or jealous...Kara is so much prettier than Katrina, and Kara can actually sing.|`|56dfvnwmaa	not really.

I clapped lol ! That girl's head was too BIG, and she acted like her stuff didn't stink! I can't stand those kind of people. I think that she really thought that Simon would always save her and keep her on the show. Well, .... she obviously didn't know Simon very well LOL.|`|daij1eBCaa	I am so glad she's gone. She didn't deserve to be there. I don't think Kara was insecure or jealous, I mean she admitted that she was a pretty girl...she just knew that Simon and Randy were only letting her through because the little **** came in half naked and that's not right and she knew it. Katrina may not be bad on the eyes but she's not that great on the ears...lol. ?|`|FEqHgYDVaa	I am not sad that she left.  She didn't belong there anyways.

"/|`|UsNgFI7haa	she was the worst she is just down right ughhhhhhhh|`|rvfuhtCRaa	She was so fake, always smiling for the cameras, but probably hurting on the inside.|`|wRwyUNGmaa	I didn't like her, but I think it's sort of crap that she's getting blamed for her group going down the toilet, the blond girl just didn't sound good in that song, it was her own fault, not Katrina's.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	Katrina had it coming. If she was smart she would have listened to the criticism of the judges and not think she was all that.

Finally,miss annoying is gone.Too bad she caused Rose Flack to be sent home.I love that girl.  Bikini girl my ***|`|KPUSUV2xaa	LMAO!    She annoyed the **** out of me. Shes so stuck up and fustrating.     But i too enjoyed the way Kara gets jealous. It was entertaining.   Kara's a ***** though, She thinks shes so famous and everyone loves her. Ive never heard of her before i watched this season of American Idol :S    I hated her since her fan came into audition. The girl wasnt a horrible singing, but she wasnt outstanding, but Kara's says to the other judges 'Thats my fans? Geez thats saying somthing..'  I thought that was so rude, considering this Young girl who auditioned absolutly idolised her?  Stuck up cow who thinks shes a diva yet noone has heard of her..    But, Katrina would be alot prettier if she wasnt so 'full' of herself.

wvM4ok44aa	That must be "Baril na Ginto," which was released in July 1964. And nope, there are no copies in DVD or VCD form.    It came out in Betamax and VHS, but even the local video stores no longer have a copy. Some movie downloading sites claim to have one though.     But the film prints are currently stored at the film library of FPJ Studios on Del Monte Avenue, Quezon City. Exclusive use for five years was granted to ABS-CBN.
BKrqlGz4aa	The answer given by "mystmoonstruck" is 100% totally and completely WRONG.  I even did about a half hour of digging on the movie   The Other Side Of Midnight" and found nothing but that doesn't disprove or prove much but the other part of her answer is wrong.    The movie was in theaters briefly in 1976 and at that time the title to the movie was "The Star Wars".  When it came back to theaters in May of 1977 the title was "Star Wars".  Most people, including Lucas himself to a certain point, thought the movie would be a monumental flop.  That's actually one of the main reasons Lucas did ep IV first.  It is the only one of the 6 that could act as a stand alone movie by that I mean it had a beginning, a middle, and a ending.  If it had flopped nobody would have ever had to know that there was more to the story.  When it became clear that the movie was going to be one of the biggest smash hits in the entire history of film Lucas realized that he would be able to tell the rest of the story so starting in the summer of 1978 Lucas began switching the movie with just the title of "Star Wars" out with versions that had the title as "Episode IV:  A New Hope"  Lucas filed the legal paperwork necessary for the title change and it became "official" on Jan 1st at 12:01 AM 1979.  This can be proved by a simple public records check in Calif.    One important thing to remember about ep IV ... it was in theaters for more than 2 years because it was so popular.  I personally think that is why people's memory sometime doesn't work right in this respect.    If you have a VHS copy of the movie that has the title as just "Star Wars" ... well my friend you are sitting on a gold mine.  Anyways ...    You are definitely NOT crazy ... the movie did have 3 different titles over the years.    May The Force Be With You ...|`|vqZ2XLf6aa	the first person is wrong, it wasn't called Episode IV A New Hope when it came out, it was just STAR WARS. He added episode IV later, i think for the reissue and the home video release. hats why the dvd has the openign crawl saying just STAR WARS. For a couple of years it was just Star Wars, thats why noone actually calls that film A New Hope, it's just reffered to by the majority of people as Star Wars as it's the original title.|`|aFksjRcdaa	Originally, it was just called 'Star Wars', with no attachment. I DO remember reading somewhere that George Lucas had named it something else when Episode I: the Phantom Menace came out and they released a box collection including the original movies, but then changed the title soemtime inbetween Episode I and Episode II: Attack of the Clones' release in 2002. Perhaps if it's an older released version of the box movie, then it was called what G.L. first called it. I'm sorry, but I don't remember the name. Perhaps try www.starwars.com and do some research.|`|Hl8x9qCEaa	George Lucas was originally going to call Star Wars Episode IV "Blue Harvest" but then he changed it. This is why the Family Guy Star Wars Parody movie, Blue Harvest is called Blue Harvest because that was what Star Wars Episode IV was going to be called.
1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	French Kiss    Sabrina|`|AA11601079	Does it have to be a romance? I thought anything with Audrey Tautou would be great, but many of those are rated R. I can't figure out why since I don't remember "Amelie" or "Happenstance" being that racy.    How about something like "The Chorus," which is about a teacher positively affecting the lives of his students with music? That's PG or PG-13. Or maybe "Au Revoir, Les Enfants," which is about a Jewish boy hiding out at a boarding school during WWII? I think that one was PG.|`|tpn7iR48aa	i dont know if it would be considered a typical romance but Amelie is a very good movie|`|BRoF5dq0aa	Un long dimanche de fian?ailles, avec Audrey Tautou

BKrqlGz4aa	Depends on which version of the movie you watch.  In the original Han shot first ... in the SE version Greedo shot first and missed then Han shot him ... in the DVD version they both shot at the same time with Greedo missing and Han not missing.  When asked why he changed the scene Lucas said that he thought having Han shoot first made him look like a cold blooded killer.  I've yet to meet a fellow Star Wars fan who doesn't think that Han shooting first was self defense.  Lucas screwed the pooch with this one ... don't even get me going on the "Ghost Switch" at the end of ep VI.    May The Force Be With You ...|`|m6CIhrgqaa	When Lucas changed the scene to make Greedo shoot first, it was blasphemy.    The ORIGINAL version is the true version! In that Han shoots first ... It makes him look more of a badass!|`|z7JsVzcnaa	In the original cut(1977 release), Han shot first.  In the Special Edition release from 1997, Greedo shot first.  As far as I'm concerned, Greedo shooting first is weak.  Han was so much more badass for shooting first.|`|Npi4QR7Maa	GREEDO!!!   I'VE SEEN IT!!!  If you pause it and go frame by frame you can see Greedo shoots first, han dodges it, than han fires his gun from under the table.  I dont know what the big fuss is about.  IT'S GREEDO GODDAMNIT!!|`|3956c292d9898cc425bc25b7923184b7aa	Greedo.|`|ETWQ3SaPaa	Greedo fired first. He raised his gun above the table, but it missed Han Solo and hit the wall. The Han shot Greedo from the gun under his table he was sitting at.|`|D8sN8gNFaa	Greedo. Then Han slid over to our right (Hans left) and shot Greedo.  Anyone who watches the scene just once can easily tell that the scene is made of of two shots when Han moved to the left, it was actually a different shot juxtaposed with the initial one to make it look like he slid over when really it's just two separate shots.|`|k7mumcQXaa	Greedo, its completely obvious it was greedo. Did u know that Boba fett survived the sarlac pit, chewbacca is the first of our heroes to die, dash Rendar did not die, All important bounty hunters either retire or become good except for IG88|`|vqZ2XLf6aa	Han. Only total c*u*nts claim that Greedo shot first. Han shot first for 20 years, only when George decided to rape the films did he alter it so Greedo shot first, thus ruining Hans character for millions of people, hence why on the dvd release it got altered so that they shot at the same time.

James Stewart could be a serious actor, he also did comedy well and even romantic leads.  George Bailey on the bridge in It's A Wonderful Life - movie scenes don't get any better than that.  That is my opinion anyway.  Good luck.  Rowan Atkinson I think has great timing and is a clever actor, but I don't think he is quite in the same class as Jimmy Stewart as an actor.|`|TUEuQIJuaa	In my opinion i think Adam Brody and Topher Grace because 1) they're funny and 2) they're hawt! ;)|`|VPBkqdxcaa	Denzel Washington|`|749a489dda09a15d224ff2a0f3c8b462aa	Tom Hanks.

Mr. Bean??? Are you serious?? Haha, whatever you say man...      MMkay...Mr.Bean is not THAT funny. Honestly. He's some of the lowest form of British humor ever. And British humor is some of the lowest there is. I'm sure that I could act funnier than him if I wanted to. Also, just because someone acts funny that doesn't make them a good actor. A good actor should be able to play a wide range of roles. Has 'Mr.Bean' ever done a serious role ever that more than a dozen people have heard of? How many awards has Rowan Atkinson won? His movies are all in the 2 dollar bin at most video stores. Watch some real entertainment. Check out some early Scorsese or Kubrick then talk to me about films.|`|tpn7iR48aa	This is to any of you people (except for Morgan): you cant possibly hope to name the best actor ever because every actor brings their own feeling and skills to each individual part. What one actor may be unable to pull off convincingly, another actor could excel at. Yet this actor who flopped miserably could be amazing in another role or another film or in fact, in the same type of role but at a different time in their life. nobody can ever be The Best it's impossible. Everyone has their unique talents to bring to the table and thats that.|`|80ehnLBJaa	William Powell    Adore him.  He was a debonair, charming, witty gentleman.  Early in his career, during the silent era, he played evil parts.  He then moved onto some great work opposite Carole Lombard (one of his wives) and Kay Francis.  But, once he moved to MGM and starred opposite Myrna Loy, it was movie magic.  Powell and Loy did 14 films together.  Some of them are my all-time favorite films.  Nick and Nora Charles were a great team!|`|fMTL7A5laa	Will Smith or Johnny Depp for sure!

lpyWVR2oaa	Even though you are a Sun sign Aquarius, you are also predominantly Earthy (5 planets in Capricorn) and Watery (Moon & Rising in Pisces).    Hence, I would say that your best bet would be with :    1) A Water Sign - especially Pisces Sun, since your Pisces female Moon would resonate beautifully with the masculine yang energies of his male Sun. His life goals would blend beautifully with your innermost needs and desires. It would be good if he has some dominant Air influence in the chart to balance your Air Sun sign.    2) An Earth Sign - especially Capricorn Sun. Cap and Aqu are next to each other on the zodiac wheel and hence, there is a good chance that the Cap would have inherited some influence from the next sign of Aquarius, making you two a more compatible match, due to more mutual understand. Furthermore, the large number of Cap planets in your chart suggest that a Cap Sun would be able to provide you with the stability and groundedness that you need.    3) Alternatively, a fellow Air sign - Gemini or Libra - with a SIGNIFICANT amount of Water and/or Earth influence in him. Although 2 Air Sun signs work great, the presence of Water and/or Earth would make him even more compatible with you on a whole overall.|`|n53BNB8taa	cancer|`|7eI0kW5Uaa	capricorn,    or give me your astrology sign.|`|NUupRBrGaa	Please you wright your birth details for your good answer|`|h3ENq8zVaa	Pisces, Cancer and Scorpio!!

Have a 50-50 chance with Cancer, Virgo    But are strongly doubtful with Taurus, Leo, Scorpio|`|YH8ERZg8aa	well, because you are an aquarius: libra, aquarius, and gemini are first and foremost the best for you...but because you have a lot of cardinal earth (capricorn) i'd say....libra with at least moon in capricorn, taurus or virgo

dqoitQ8Jaa	Going from 10/46 I assume to 11/49?  Such a small incremental change you should be alright unless you are using different gauge E A D strings (customizing to your playing style) SRV would tune down a semitone and he used heavy strings which would be in the 12/56 gauge.  If you do that you may want to readjust your setup a little higher.|`|2vzj65Kfaa	Should not be a problem.    But, once you have changed the gauge and decided that you like it and will continue using that gauge regularly, do keep on eye on the neck in the first few months and also check the intonation to see if it needs to be tweaked a little.|`|SkRJNhuCaa	Depending on the instrument and how it's set up already, there is unlikely to be any harm to it even in the long run.    Check the neck, if it's clearly bent you will want to adjust the trussrod, otherwise leave it alone.    Most instruments need no work unless you go up or down more than one gauge from what it is set up for, so if yours was already set up for 10s, 11s should be fine.

I5EWEvaUaa	Definately Nirvana. Guns n roses come out in the late 80's and were kind of at the tail end of the 80's hair metal era.     Nirvana, however came out in the early 90's and was the "new sound" of a new decade...namely, grunge. EVERYBODY jumped on the grunge bandwagon, and made Nirvana a huge success while Guns was kind of forgotten as old 80's hair band rock. Hope this answers your question.|`|89xzNpVaaa	Actually they were almost at the same level but just when Nirvana released Nevermind, they got shadowed by Nirvana and then in 1992 GNR releases their single "November Rain" which becomes a huge hit, so they were both tied. But anyway Nirvana was like the Jonas Bros. of the early 90s, so i believe Nirvana. And I LOVE Nirvana!|`|ONuy5vniaa	Nirvana easily, at the time they were using a new sound which caught on very quickly, and massivly.    Guns and roses (although I like them) were not doing anything really spectacular, it was just good music.|`|D8sN8gNFaa	About equal depending on how you look at it.|`|PlMlm4zcaa	yeah it was obviouslly nirvana lol|`|sWRiaFDVaa	Nirvana.

LBovv7Sxaa	I'm wondering that too.  Maybe rousseau even remembered jin when she was alive.  The preview for next week looks like the losties and rousseau's team duke it out.  If one of her guys loses an arm, then we'll know the past can change...the past?   Explaining time travel hurts my head, lol      Look up rousseau on lostpedia!!|`|e3aa59c3d632d81017a07c24b57c8931aa	Yes.  It was a good episode.  But no.  I do not think the future will change with this meeting.  I think Jin will have a hard time getting Rousseau to believe him even if he figures it out himself.  Remember he has no idea he's in another time.  By the time he figures out when he is, he will get transported to another time.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Yes, I did.  It was excellent.   They also showed last week's episode again in my area.    No, I don't think Jin and The French Lady will be able to change the future.  They both slipped into the "past" of the island.|`|F87Cvjqaaa	I am so so so so LOST right now!!!  How is Jin alive, I thought he was dead! How is he on the island? Will the losties realise? Will it change the future? Will the shifting in time ever stop?    So many questions which are all just answered with more questions!!|`|d2RV8HTmaa	I don't think Jin will understand about the time travel theory.  He doesn't know anything about that.  I think he will be very confused about seeing a young Rousseau.  Maybe he will even think he's delirious due to the accident, dehydration, etc., and certainly even if he does try to explain to Rousseau that he knows her "16 years from now"...she will think he's confused and delirious.  I don't think the future can be changed any more than the past can be changed.|`|YIcBd569aa	I think if jin tells rousseau what her fate is, it may change the way she behaves  in the future, she may not have alex taken from her but she will still die even if she avoids keamy in the future. remember they said that if you are supposed to die then death will have you, you can't change that time will find a way of correcting itself for every change you make.

DzJMU6lzaa	sadly enough, ABC puts up their videos on friday. you will not be able to find it. if you honestly cant wait for tomorrow here is what happened:    so you know how sawyer and all of them were on the boat. after people started shooting at them, the sky went white again and seconds later they were still in the ocean but those people were gone and it was raining. they get ashore and they find all of this trash on the island...they first think it's rubbish from the plane and assume they traveled back in time when they first crashed but the items were labeled in french.     meanwhile, ben and sayid meet up with kate at the marina and kate finds out ben is the "client" that wants custody of her baby. it crazy though because it then shows sun with a gun pulling up with aron inside of her car.     back to the island, it shows a group of french people on a floating raft and they see a body in the ocean and they go after it and pull it up on their raft and guess who it is? JIN! so he did not die. it turns out he was time traveling without being concious. the french people revived him once they got on shore. these french people as you probably already know have never been seen yet on the show. we find out the woman that helps jin (she speaks english) is actually rousseau! but a younger and pregnant rousseau. basically...they traveled back about 17 years when rousseau still had her baby! at this point jin is freaking out!|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I'll just tell you what happens....The Chinese air force drops a nuke and blows everyone up.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	ABC.com  Hulu.com      Set your DVR to start recording lost 10 minutes early and ending 10 minutes late!

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	From what I heard or read, the title, Who Are You, fit the type of the original show. We'll just conveniently forget the fact the rest of the lyrics make NO sense related to the show. In the other spinoffs, they simply kept with The Who for familiarity. I quickly stopped watching CSI: Miami because David Caruso has such an irritating acting "style". Ever noticed he never faces anyone he talks with? He always stands sideways so he can look over his shoulder with his hands on his hops and elbows out. The rest if the franchise have gone all science fiction. I still watch the original series but I will miss Grissom.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If you're talking about the original show, it's probably because of the name of the song. "Who are you?" Someone probably thought it was clever, since the crime lab rats frequently have to figure out who somebody is.  If you're asking about the spin-offs, they most likely wanted to maintain some consistency in the franchise.|`|bKtpUETnaa	matches with the song dont you think|`|AA11593134	the creator is The Who fan.

18RphOP6aa	Well the story is that he was in his van without pants and was getting busy with himself {rumour}, the cops were called and he tried to flee and nearly ran the officer over {allegedly}.  His side is he spilled juice on himself and climbed into the back of his van where he thought no one could see and was in the process of changing his pants when the office showed up. He denies trying to flee.  Anyway he left the show to deal with this matter and it says on wikipedia that he may be back.

FUNsFQEtaa	no she (Catherine Hardwicke) is not gonna director the next movie for all i know   i think she refused and they got director Chris Weitz to direct new  moon....i don't know why she refused but well if twilight gained the interest of girls more than boys then i think Weitz is gonna work to attract the boys as well as the girls|`|yvSO7mW0aa	The first three are defiantly being made into movies........ Hopefully Breaking Dawn, too!!!  But Catherine Hardwicke (she directed Twilight) isn't directing the other movies.  Chris Weitz (He directed The Golden Compass) is directing New Moon.

The main cast (pattinson, stewart, lutz, greene) signed for three movies, but not the fourth one yet. They didnt sign for the fourth because they were not sure if Twilight would do good. Since Twilight became a huge hit, and im sure the other two movies will, they will defently sign for the fourth movie.|`|Tfqeiu0Saa	Well, as of now they are shooting ,or just starting to shoot new moon. They are going to film new moon and eclipse back to back, and I'm not sure about breaking dawn.|`|nKQY9hTaaa	Unfortunately, Catherine Hardwicke (the Twilight director) is not coming back to direct. New Moon will be directed by Chris Weitz. We do not know if Eclipse and Breaking Dawn will become movies, but ti it highly likely they will be. The Twilight fandom is at a rapid rate, and we Summit Entertainment just needs to know if they'll make enough money (same with Twilight, the movie).

HSSuKNCUaa	Me and my man have a bit of an age difference but it's working just fine. I'm a 22 year old Taurus, he's a 35 year old Aries. I think the age difference is good. His experience makes me feel like I can be honest and he won't break when I get a little bullish (Taurus can be a bull in a china shop). He's had a few more years than me to calm down a bit and explore the world freely and now he knows what he wants - and I'm lucky that that turned out to be me :-)    Advice? Just be yourself. Aries can handle Taurus just fine. Don't be afraid to have a fight now and then. Don't be afraid to be honest with him. Also, don't try and make him jealous, it kills his self-esteme (I know Aries has a reputation of seeming arrogant, but they can be really insecure). If you're not in a relationship yet but you have your eye on Aries, don't give him too much attention; just show him you think he's great and walk away. He'll come after you eventually. He can't resist.    If he wants to be alone every now and then, let him - and trust him. He won't lie to you if you trust him. If he doesn't feel trusted, he WILL start lying.     Happy hunting :-)|`|D48KtNRKaa	dont let that choose who u want 2 be with.age aint nothin but a  !!!! good luck Dr.K|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	...........................|`|k1GC2tVSaa	If there is love, honesty, loyalty, respect and trust.

I was a huge fan of River's and don't want to see him go down the same path. He went to rehab back in 2003 or something like that,and now there's picture of him drinking. He needs to go back to rehab!! Yes, music has been his life but I never once heard him talk about rap until now!! I hope he gets his act together and come back on top.

He needs to help the man out!!!!!!|`|4jOaN0WIaa	Yes, I lose sleep nights worrying about him.|`|5Crovdoaaa	It's his mother's job to worry about him, not a complete stranger.

a6QK1oQFaa	yeah, i write it sometimes in my graphic calculator ( if u have one) ...or i sometimes write it behind my scientific calculator with  a pencil,.it never shows...  or if no calculators are allowed, i write the notes on  tiny piece of paper and staple it under my sleeve :) lol..always works..    never write anything on ur hand.. u wil most likely get caught !|`|ccZuEOEfaa	No, never in an exam or test.  In class we always shared answers or just checked the back of the book, but I don't ever remember cheating in an actual assessment.    Edit: After reading the answer above me, I have to agree with the graphics calculator thing. I had pretty much the whole chemistry syllabus typed into that thing! But that's not cheating because you're allowed to do it. You're even allowed to take in 2 graphics calculators to the exam! (That was last years rules, anyway.)|`|AA11854330	Yeah..  Whispering =) Once it worked =)|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	yes|`|0ii4V9bEaa	yh, duh. Me ad ma m8s always used to help each other.

For a test, we'd split the questions among ourselves to study and during the test, we would help each other. Like say an answer to a question is clock, and I was the one who had to say the answer, I would say, " What time is it? Look at the CLOCK! Cough cough."    But I regret it cuz it did us no good. I don't cheat anymore and you know that man 3'ashana falesa mina. so yeah...........|`|KOsGtal8aa	yes, n iv never got caught! haha|`|l05exvJvaa	Eh DUH everyone has.

Please take good care of yourself Clo.|`|7USVsDuIaa	I take Echonasia tablets.|`|LoRgAmc6aa	Continue the OJ not only for Vitamin C but postassium and other needed vitamins. Believe it or not, the horsepill vitamins will really help, lots of fluids always help, soups and bullion broths are included in that, take Advil or Aleve for body aches because they reduce the inflammation that's causing the aching. Use Vapo Rub on your chest and neck to keep your nose and throat passages clear. Use saline spray up in your nose to keep it moist. Dry nasal passages catch bacteria and viruses much easier. Rest all you can!!|`|9tf9VF9naa	drink lots o water. boil water with some dry ginger, sugar and crushed pepper. have it and take a nap. it works for me.|`|eCs32xBTaa	Sorry to hear about that, a hot tea with honey and lime juice always work for me.

These are all true. Maybe you can use one of them.    1."I can't come in today and tomorrow. I have to go to Bakersfield and help my brother castrate a bunch of bulls". He came back two days later as promised.    2. "Some $ ^&&%$ stole my %&^@  car!!!!".  When he came to work the next day, with his car, he explained that the %$&&& @  ^%  $@!!^& that stole it brought it back and parked it in his garage.     3. " My wife shot me last night. I'm going to be a little late". Actually she did. Just winged him though. And he was at work by 10:00. He is not one to let a minor injury keep him from work.    4. " I'm really drunk and I'm not sure where I am. I think I'm gonna to be late".     5. " My alarm didn't go off. I didn't know it was Monday".    6. (one of my favorites) "I Forgot I changed jobs. I went to the old place by mistake".     7. "I'm having really bad cramps". When I reminded him that he was only about half way through his gender change he replied that that half was what was giving him cramps and since I was a man I just "Wouldn't understand!".     8. " I can't come to work today because I can't stand working next to that b**** you hired last week".  I kept the b*** and fired her.     9. "I forgot to tell you. I'm having a tummy tuck today. I should be in next week".    10. (my favorite) " You cheap %$%^&&$ $@!!! I got a better job. Pays a &^^% pot more than you do!!!!. You miserable &^^%$$ @!!!  ^^%$ you!!!"  Well, when he found out that that $49.00 an hour job required a Class C driver certification, which he didn't have, he was back at work the next day.    Oh yes, it's fun and entertaining being a boss.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	I think I'm having a  vision problem - I just can't see me coming to work today!    I got carjacked last night.

Guys: Don't call a girl Hot or cute, call her beautiful. Its means more :)|`|P4Jc76GPaa	Little Miss Strawberries,  It all depends on how the person would react to your comments. The simplest, yet hardest advice is to be simple. Don;t try and nuke it or try and be different. In most cases other have tried this approach and failed. Some examples to say to a woman would be;  1. You have beautiful eyes.    2. You are very beautiful.  3. That shirt brings out the colors in your eyes.  4. You have beautiful hands.  I have always found that when I say something like this to a woman I will say it then walk away, unless she makes the next move and begins a conversation. The key is to be honest instead of being something else. Otherwise you will look and sound like a goofball.|`|ICRWH76Yaa	3 out of 4 guys want nothing more than to get in your pants    we take a little longer to mature|`|YE0baNYRaa	dont seem desperate in front of your partner.|`|rcRoF7WNaa	Guys - Girls don't mind seeing your weaknesses, it's endearing.    Girls - Don't be too whiny.|`|jgKb7YVZaa	i agree. my boyfriend has always called me beautiful, he's never said i'm hot. it's much better in my eyes.     my advice for guys is if you catch her looking at your lips then kiss her lips gently and confort her if she is nervous. staring at the opposites lips is generally a sign of wanting a kiss but beign too scared...     xox jen xox|`|44d472ebef2f7cbc54d3e55e0a6eaae6aa	Don't trust 'em as far as you can throw them and make sure they keep their hands where you can see them.|`|DooqYRfAaa	To guys: Be a gentleman.... and drop the attitude.

UgNHBJ3Jaa	100% Agree with you mate this world has gone mad.....and like you say actions speak louder, what makes me laugh is you have to be white to be racist don't you??? yet i witness it everyday.....i used to live in an area where white people were the minority.....racism exsists in every race, its just that we can't say anything what would help is if we were aloud to air our views freely without being arrested by the thought police....i'm not racist but i do have the right to stick up for my own race....|`|kecdkv6jaa	A lot of people actually.  thats why they changed the biscuits name to "scallywags"      http://www.arnotts.com/downloads/product...|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	a blondle joke i racist on here it is stupid people have no idea if you say black your racist if you say asian your racist but if you say white no one gives a schitt|`|7USVsDuIaa	Hahahahahahahahahaha!!!!    Well Golliwog's where I live are biscuits.  People are crazy and I can sit here and tell you to try and block it out but that's impossible I've tried.

But I agree, actions are racist, not words.|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	For two reasons I think. One is that the word "wog" is there and secondly both the doll and the biscuit are brown in colour with the stereotypical "*****" hairdo.  Personally I think people are reading too much into things these days. We have a cheese here in Australia called "C o   o n" and yet nothing has been said about that.|`|0ii4V9bEaa	because a golliwog has dark skin.

She got me the black doll.I think the PC Brigade have gone bonkers.|`|ff7fc6889663558c1c97fb10a9748022aa	My first memory of the word Golliwog was what the figure on the strawberry jam jar was called, how this has now been interpreted as racist and when i have no i dea.|`|dCMi5rjdaa	calm down.......    I have never heard of Golliwog, but sounds very much like    'polliwog'.  am going to assume(by your post) you're talking about a doll.  perhaps even one that might in some way resemble a frog.    b.t.w. there are words that are VERY racist-------  not to use them hear, but to call a ***** something other than a ***** would be racist!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|jkkatZfBaa	Maybe because they don't know what it means.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I think it's to do with the history behind the golliwog. It was a copy of the minstrels, who were white people pretending to be black slaves.    Hmmmm, sounds racist to me!!    And this question is probably to do with the BBC dropping Carol Thatcher for using the term golliwog when referring to a tennis player. I don't think it was acceptable for her to use that term, it wouldn't even cross my mind to say that someone looked like a goliwog.|`|w6xct1qQaa	PC gone ***** mad, soon not be able to open my ***** gob to anyone for fear of "Allegedly" upsetting them...*shakes head*|`|UUKWOWhnaa	I'm not sure Honky.|`|mAjyNjV5aa	Bertha Upton, wrote the accompanying verse. The book's main characters were two Dutch dolls, Peg and Sarah Jane, and the Golliwogg. The story begins with Peg and Sara Jane, on the loose in a toy shop, encountering "a horrid sight, the blackest gnome." The little black "gnome" wore bright red trousers, a red bow tie on a high collared white shirt, and a blue swallow-tailed coat. He was a caricature of American black faced minstrels - in effect, the caricature of a caricature. She named him Golliwogg.    It was meant to be an attack on African people.  the gays would have also found it offensive if some shop sold dolls and called them 'aggots!|`|DwrEWLKDaa	I was born in the UK and lived here all my life, I managed to make it to 25 yrs old, and never heard this word. The first Christmas after graduating from Medical school, I decided to volunteer for a homeless charity providing GP services - one of the patients called me a wog and smiled. I smiled back as I had no idea what he meant. When I asked my parents, they told me exactly what it meant. Words, as well as actions can be incredibly racist, until someone calls you a racial slur, you have no idea how hurtful it is, and no room to decide how hurt/offended others have the right to be.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	Ok. If it makes you happy to believe that, then do so. I guess we can always fall back on the "Sticks and stones" argument.    The simple fact that these words are used to separate people. To distinguish them as separate from "us". They are used to belittle and humiliate.    When you've been on the receiving end of abuse you might understand better. My girlfriend is of mixed race. We frequently get people (mostly kids) shouting "Oi! **** " at us, particularly at her. One day last year it was accompanied with stones being thrown at her.    She usually finds it irritating but nothing more. It's the underlying threat and the fact that we are being singled out. It just adds to that whole culture of simmering resentment against other races. At the end of the day it's bullying.    Naturally, when you're actually assaulted it's worse. Feel free to align yourself with that sort of thing. Just don't expect me to be happy with it.    Edit. Yep. It happens to all people of all races. Been on both sides of the fence. I don't call myself Hypocrite for nothing. I think that we as a nation need to move on from days of empire. Sure in the past it was a fine thing and nobody gave a second thought to using all sorts of language. Times have changed. The population has changed. The world has changed.    I think we can keep our national identity and include our new friends in it too. If we try.|`|aIakDSstaa	Who cares what they think anyway, I sure as hell dont|`|UjPArJZ6aa	I have no idea hun. It's absolutely stupid. I for one say, lets bring the golliwogs back!|`|AMFajJCgaa	Good point.

"|`|mpbTnSAPaa	I agree with you on that one....    the PC Brigade (BBC) moaning over nothing.|`|8uIfskigaa	No think it is wrong as it is not about the toy but the meaning behind the word...... same as people thinking is ok to take the p*ss out of Irish all the time even though we have a great sense of humour & we take it well....there is a fine line that shouldn't be crossed......just my opinion .. :)|`|3d6119cf4a9df27c12f9843ac9018153aa	I bet The Queen sells Ginger biscuits - she doesn't care if she offends her own Grandson!

The problem is that the PC Brigade has too much influence in this country (Great Britain) these days and messing the whole place up causing storms in tea cups.  So Carol Thatcher was heard to say the wrong thing during a PRIVATE conversation so gets pilloried. A prince is heard referring to his friend by his nickname,  all over the papers.  I do not care!  A lot of my friends refer to me as Harold as I do look a bit like H. Shipman.  It is a joke, I do not care.  The word Golliwog has been around for years, it was the later part that was high jacked as slang.  So why not complain about the slang?  It will get them no where.|`|Go3pq7xHaa	So bloody what? Mind you, I can't imagine what a female golliwog would be like - traditional golliwogs - the golliwog I had when i was little - were always boys.......know what I think?... the PC people were all deprived as children. Furthermore a golliwog, to me, does not indicate black skin so much as untidy hair e.g. "Just wait a minute while I fix my hair; I look like a real golliwog". I'd never seen this tennis player but thought Thatcher might have been referring to dreadlocks until I Googled a picture of him.  I think Carol Thatcher is a bit of a drip, though. And so are these PC people. Send them to Australia. We need all the rain we can get.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	Given the climate it's best to remove it.

I'm not actually a racist but do think that this political correctness thing is absolutely ridiculous.

AA10240238	This year, of course it is the freeing of Capt Richie, but for a normal course of Easter....    I did not get gifts.  We had an Easter basket with Easter Eggs that we had colored.  Mom also set up an Easter egg hunt.  One year she learned that she needed to make a list for herself to make sure all the eggs were found.  That year she found one egg in June, that we had not found.    After the eggs were found, we had deviled eggs with our dinner.

Leda2ha0aa	I have not heard that either Bob or Jillian are leaving the show.  Jillian did leave a few years back and Kim replaced her.  I don't think people took to Kim very well and so Jillian came back.  They did do a 3 trainer season one time, maybe that is happening again.    I have always been a big fan of Bob's.  I think Jillian gets a bit whacked out when she's training people and starts yelling at them.|`|AA11991027	I haven't heard anything    and I have to admit I have not watched this season but the people at work talk about it so I hear enough    they both make the show watchable    I hope they both come back
AA11601079	They're not only about stalkers and killers. Many are also about eating disorders, runaways, addictions, insanity, and inter-generational conflicts. Lifetime has cornered the market on these made-for-TV movies. Where else could we get our fix of them?|`|1hciyvKdaa	Lifetime is run by a bunch of women too!!
KPFBbi06aa	10 mins|`|m6Ih7DHYaa	last night when the bf called asking me out for lunch today|`|Up6ANLQeaa	about 30 minutes|`|SaUIJeKDaa	its been a long long time. my mom went on a technology rampage and cut everything from phone to cable to internet.     (but i got the cable and internet back.)|`|tYk1G8Qlaa	It's been about 3 hours. It's 11:19 pm here now so that's why no one has called me in  3 hours.|`|AA11178767	My cell phone rang about 20 min. ago...|`|kGCd8ioRaa	hrs|`|AA11854330	Long time...|`|EWyEbUctaa	afew minutes|`|AA11821715	4 hours|`|s3FUR37xaa	Hours ago.|`|LoRgAmc6aa	About 5 minutes ago.|`|MpYIFWe7aa	1 hour ago..
tYk1G8Qlaa	Well there are a lot of problems but the main problems is right now is that in the last 3 weeks i have lost 5 loved ones. They passed away and i'm hurting so much and don't know if i can get through this on my own.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	It is a fact: it's a communication problem.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Life sucks!|`|shvhgzXeaa	Well............|`|lFqm9XlUaa	I do not have 2 b up till 7 and it is 6:25....

eCs32xBTaa	Yes, i want to quit from my job so bad !|`|tYk1G8Qlaa	Yes i do but quiting is the easy way out of hard times. But honestly i feel like quiting now.|`|RyE0Ki6Gaa	Yeah, all the time  but i found that if I dont give up, I'm always successfull WOO!|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Yes, I have the urge every single day.|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	At least once or twice a week. Do you ever just want to quit?|`|d5d2932031efa991954aa3468bb79f0faa	Only when I have had heavily spiced cooking and I can't stop belching.|`|d09ca82ef4d1521ac23c334df2e8eedeaa	Yes. But I can't :)
daij1eBCaa	Air, or at least it seems like it. I get so mad because when you open the bag, it's like only half full of chips, maybe even less! I don't want to pay for air! ?|`|AA11821715	60% chips 40% air|`|LoRgAmc6aa	According to hubby, you get more air ... and I agree. I'm always squeezing the bags to check where the level of chips start. LOL|`|c2YcBbXyaa	seems like mostly air.........btw have you tried the TGIfridays chips? the bacon & cheddar ones are excellent!|`|tYk1G8Qlaa	I have worked out two things with bags of chips where i live. If you buy bags of chips at the start of the week they are more air compared to the end of the week when you get more chips. Second thing is some stores are cunning and put the ones with more chips in the bag at the back of the shelf.|`|mSnNKp8waa	they are sold by weight not volume.|`|TYKMdNmMaa	More air = less fat|`|kGCd8ioRaa	the  chips settle so much during shipment - it seems like you are buying a lot of air
kGCd8ioRaa	no, you are just curious|`|hritHZZcaa	yes...well maybe. find something else to do :)|`|AA11821715	Could be nervous, you could be with a sexy girl and all you do is ask questions trying to find common ground to talk.|`|s3FUR37xaa	Absolutely! Well, I find your questions interesting..|`|S27eQ45paa	What are you saying?  That I'm boring?  LOL|`|Acq3JBiHaa	Hey, whatever works, right?|`|TVsP2TQNaa	is answering them all a sign of boredom      yes        maybe were in love|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	yes|`|I8voelnWaa	people don't question enough|`|tYk1G8Qlaa	Nope, Well it would be if they were stupid questions but yours are not stupid they are interesting and fun to answer so in your case no it's not boredom.
tYk1G8Qlaa	If you are talking about valentines day all i want is a " I love you" From my husband.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	something else after giving the flowers and chocolates.|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	sex|`|dCMi5rjdaa	something else....:)|`|lFqm9XlUaa	No. I would not mind candy though. If your talking about Valentines day, I have to baby sit. So I am expecting money $.$|`|AA11854330	Nothing anymore|`|Up6ANLQeaa	something else...I like surprises :)|`|OfZI0BaQaa	all of the above lol. anddd a romanticcc sweet poem you wrote yourself to let her know how much you thought about her !!        *swoooonnn*|`|BGKIJeTGaa	I want chocolate.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	Nothing : (|`|KPFBbi06aa	what i am expecting is free of charge and much more pleasurable than candy and flowers|`|6wljdQ9kaa	all of them
LoRgAmc6aa	No it was my W2's that I was expecting ... thank God! I have such a lazy former employer... she can't do anything on time.|`|tYk1G8Qlaa	Nope, I wanted to get a letter from the lotto saying i won the big prize lol|`|9iNCQkWlaa	Ya ...just another ad flyer for pizza|`|kGCd8ioRaa	nope it wasn't|`|hritHZZcaa	im not expecting one|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	no its only meant to be $69 not $87|`|lFqm9XlUaa	No I never get mail, even though I mail people I do not get mail. not even for my birthday.|`|Hi1xY7sGaa	No I'm afraid not. It was a package actually, I thought my photos might have been delivered but it's something else because it's addressed to my brother.  xxx|`|VERrlErvaa	No... it never is... they're the best kind.

0sEspN5baa	God and chocolate cake - ahh what could   be more divinely sublime?????    At least that's how it feels to me when  I'm in communion with chocolate cake  in the wee hours.......    I may not answer many of yours, but  I ALWAYS READ them, and get a  kick out of your incredibly facile mind.  And creativity can look like boredom to  some (in relation to one of your other  Qs).      Now I've got to go brush my teeth.....    (I know, medically, the liver's cleaning itself around  4 am - based on people who go to bed  at 10pm - but chocolate cake IS chocolate cake)    This Q may not appeal to those who aren't  chocoholics like me (well, I'm a recovering one)    thanks for the Q :)    [and, until reading your Q about buying air and  bags of chips, I had prided myself on the fact  that, as of yet, I may buy water, but I don't  buy air - so does that also mean that I'm buying  air 'time' as well???  If I keep the bag closed  and don't open it??? lol]|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	good idea, i do it too.|`|v0owu3cBaa	Chocolate cake anytime. Good idea!|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	Bad if you haven't brushed your teeth.  But you shouldn't esp. if you're going to sleep after eating it|`|ICRWH76Yaa	been there, done that, bad idea|`|Pl7GnQfqaa	If you want to sleep, bad... if you want to wake up, good.|`|NrrB3eyDaa	Good.  :).|`|tYk1G8Qlaa	It's good, Save some for me, I'll be there in 2 minutes :)|`|p03Jc7eHaa	for breakfast or a before bed snack?|`|kGCd8ioRaa	not really a good idea|`|oDUuAs9Raa	Good...unless you`re washing it down with a beer or two..|`|DooqYRfAaa	Good!  Go for it!|`|Up6ANLQeaa	Good idea! Its fun to live dangerously!
AA10077992	Does your mummy know what heartless, vile ,abusive words you are putting on the family PC? - you are going the right way to have , not only this account suspended, but the whole family's Yahoo account.

Grow up or Shut up|`|aKhZNd7daa	Like Titch I can't say anymore than what's already been said by other RTV Regs and if I did I'd only be giving you the attention you obviously crave.

I have never had any time for Jade Goody, but no one deserves to have that awful disease. Isn't it about time you learnt to  have some compassion ? & if seeing her plight encourages women to get regular smear tests & it saves even one life, all the publicity has been worth it !!!!!|`|aE5xh2N7aa	HOPEFULLY NOT CUZ SHES ES A WHORE|`|mQu7mXHAaa	Don't be nasty,it could happen to you.|`|LsEyhvOtaa	I fu*king hope not!    Before anyone starts having a go at me, I had two cancerous lumps removed from my back last year so please, don't bother! I am not an ignorant, attention seeking whore - she is!|`|hH6LTbEtaa	I cant believe that someone would sink so low. I think you are disgusting to ask a question like this. She is ill and as someone who's mother has cancer, i know that it is a horrible thing to have and can make you so ill you don't want to live. She is trying to make extra money because she has children to support and if she was to die she wants to make sure they are safe like any normal mum. I think that maybe you should grow up and get a life you never know it could be you that has it next.|`|AE9dKMEFaa	you really are heartless, you think you are been controversial and witty but whoever you are thank god i don't know such a spineless cretin.    But don't worry, one day YOU WILL get your comeuppence!!!    Pity, we regulars on here won't be able to see it.    so lipgloss troll...i for one will not be answering anymore of your childish posts, i will not add fuel to your sad pathetic fire and i suggest everyone else does the same.|`|DtU1EpoVaa	Jade has never ask anyone to pity her. Don't you think that her sad situation might make more woman go and get that smear that they have being putting off and if by her no covering her head saves just one persons life then good for her for showing us what it can be like to have cancer.    I really hope the drug works and she does live for a good few years so she can see her children grow up|`|EFZRSqFcaa	Hear Hear to Tony and Riggs!|`|NQFV2AdZaa	Why are you so cynical and just plain nasty? You keep asking nasty questions about Jade, without even beginning to contemplate how difficult this time must be for her. I feel for her family and am disgusted by some people's lack of understanding. God forbid you ever go through what she is, i wouldn't wish that on anybody!|`|swbS13Xmaa	Doubt it.I think she is taking the drug as a last resort.|`|wmBK9uASaa	I get what you are saying and I can understand your way of thinking....|`|e29AeC1Qaa	I do not think so unfortunately, especially as the cancer is so far spread.|`|FcHplZtQaa	you are a nasty little cow, do you have any friends?

But the question is "Do you think the movie was good"  so:  Personally i think seeing they had such a low budget and had to cut a long book into what 2 hours?  i think they did a good job  They made alot of money from Twilight so New moon is going to be brilliant !  Personally.|`|4hEbaIMOaa	no.|`|u84hPxW1aa	It was not as good as the book.|`|sLud0Q7Laa	no dude w.e im my opinion how does a vampire what to eat u but cant cuzh he like u wtf|`|xoJmeLQvaa	Not really, for me it's standard movie.

tuATxHsVaa	My explanation involves neuroscience and is logical    1) Most people are right-handed and therefore the development took the shape that it did. People saw a good idea and went with it. 70-95% of people are right handed. How could string playing have developed in the reverse? It could never have. But read on... I will explain exactly why the hands that do these jobs are doing them.    2) There are neuroscientific explanations for the reasons that left-handed people cannot always successfully reverse the playing position and get professional results. Let me elaborate on what I hypothesize:     Left handed people have a disadvantage because of the structure of the brain. The hemispheres generally have different abilities. Generally speaking, the right brain is more visual, somewhat more artistic, and the left brain is language/logic oriented. Don't forget now, the right hand is controlled by the left brain, and the left hand by the right brain. That is key.     The science of string playing comes largely from bowing, which is tied more to the "langauge/logic" oriented left brain than the "artistic" right. Therefore, the language of music produced by bowing can only be viably reproduced with one's right hand. If one reverses the bow arm, one loses the ability to effectively communicate his or her music. There is one more reason why bowing can only be done well with the right hand -    Bowing is something that we learn over time. The many ways that we move our arm - viz. the complex muscular motions, can only be remembered by the "somatosensory cortex" which is located on the left brain. This part of the brain recalls muscular movements in their exact form and allows a person to reproduce them again and again. Movements like martele, spiccatto, legato, marcatto, etc., must be recalled by this somatosensory cortex in order to be reproduced again and again. This can only be done well via the left brain's influence on your right hand.    The artistic elements of music are reproduced with the left hand fingers and arm. Recognizing how to move your left hand/left arm in order to produce good intonation and vibrato (the "art") can only be accomplished via the right brain's link to your left side.     Now, when a person reverses their hands, they can still use these brain locations in the exact same way. There is a link between the hemispheres called the "corpus callosum" and I suspect that anyone reversing their hands in string playing is obviously overloading their corpus callosum in order to control their hands correctly. This would slow down the learning process immensely, to say the least. Learning how to send information to the other side of your brain and thus influence the wrong side of the body for a task might take many years.    MOST IMPORTANT NOTE:    And now for a final note. I have several left-handed friends who play violin exactly the same way that right handed players do. They understand that the brain works a certain way, and to go against that way is to undermine the principal of the way string music should be performed. They are good musicians and one would never guess that they are left-handed until they start writing.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	I suspect that the "weaker" hand can exercise finer motor control, the right hand being a bit too strong. Funny thing "handedness", I am strongly right handed but cannot deal a pack of cards right handed, I play better delicate tennis shots left handed but can't serve left-handed. So I suspect that the left hand is better for "fiddly" tasks , if you'll forgive the pun.|`|bb6cd77825eb74955d957ac23093ab37aa	because the inventors were all left handed and they hated people that were switch or right handed, they assumed nobody else would play it|`|3JLg1tcRaa	Maybe because people who are right handed have better coordination to be able to move their hands back and forth in rhythmic motion, apposed to just moving the fingers around up and down...|`|XJqPzSbTaa	The problem seems to be psychological and physical. Very few string players are left handed, and those that are often come up against physical or psychological issues. The strong action of playing a string instrument is with the right hand, it is the right hand that drives the sound and the phrase. In many ways the left hand just has to keep up, or get there in time.     1) the left hand doesn't require a lot of strength although dexterity is really valuable. The right hand requires much more strength and an enormous amount of balance to produce a consistently strong sound. So it was a natural progression towards the development of the cello/violin as it is.     2) Left handed people are actually at a disadvantage.     I have met a retired professional left handed violinist in Melbourne. She was quite extraordinary but told tales of the hours and hours of bowing exercises she had to put herself through to be able to achieve anything like a professional bow technique.     I knew a left handed cellist in my youth orchestra many years ago. She really struggled to produce a strong sound. Whatever she was doing to develop in her first year at uni left her with RSI so bad I don't think she has played since.     I have also seen a left handed violinist playing a left handed (or reversed) custom made violin. He was a particularly odd person and created a lot of difficulties for the back of the seconds where he sat as his bowings always appeared reversed.    I hope that answers the question - never be jealous of a left handed string player as they definitely don't have an advantage.|`|2zkcZNx0aa	I would just like to say, that this is a question i have asked myselfsince i started playing. I am totally left handed and by totally I mean I do everything wit my left hand.What annoys me is when people turn the strings around on the guitar to make it left handed.I honestly dont understand why they do this?!I play guitar classically, as well as electric and acoustic, and It annoys me when people dont play it like I do.Its tradition to play the guitar the way round that I do.You never saw Villa Lobos or Sor play like that! I think its just all a bit of an excuse personally.|`|jgEvnYNlaa	All of the other responses are great and informative but I ask you- Why do you think the left hand does all of the work? I can see why you might say that with a bowed instrument. In the case of classical guitar, the right hand in my opinion, works just as hard as the fretting hand. In fact for some pieces, it works even harder. Even when a plectrum is used, the right hand works very hard with sweeping and skipping.     Great question but a little short sighted.|`|cuGgMiixaa	A 'friend'?|`|n99NOgHJaa	My first violin lessons where with a left handed violinist.She played , and taught me to play, like any right handed person would.She was a very good violinist and the only trouble she had that I knew of was that she sometimes  forgot about the bowing so sometimes she would do the opposite bowing simply because she didn't notice the notation. But I think that has more to do with her actually technique and not because of her left-handedness..She was a wonderful teacher though!|`|jbAr62ybaa	An intriguing question 'del_i_cio-'; not sure I can offer anything worthwhile, but will take a stab at it.    1) that the vast majority of the population is and has always been decidedly right-handed, is a scientifically, statistical fact that few if any would dispute.         And because of the human tendency to conform, most societal tradition has been to encourage children to learn to perform repetitive tasks with their right hand, as opposed to the left.         And although the dexterity that was required to execute the strings precise fingerings etc., these manipulations don't require full arm movement - of both the upper and lower arms - continuously, as that of bowing; and therefore perhaps because the bow movement was perceived as a more muscularly demanding, repetitive technique to be mastered, that this was at the outset the logic used in making such a determination.    2) neurological wireing, hence mis-firing, is the only thing that I can think of that might account for the incongruouss example you cited in part 2: left side of the brain controls the right side of the body---------that sort of thing; where there probably is a unique, mutational anatomo/physiological cause for it in such individuals.         Trust some of the above may make sense--------                                                   Alberich|`|QXQWDw1qaa	I suspect it has something to do with job security.  For CENTURIES.. until the latter part of the TWENTIETH century, in fact.. many people considered the LEFT side of the body to be the EVIL side of the body.. The MEDICAL TERM "Senestra" or "Sinister" is still used for describing parts of the left side of the body (Dexter, the root word for DESTRIOUS is used for the RIGHT side of the body).    Anyway.. let's say you were a musician about 10 CENTURIES ago and wandered the countryside making your living... there were a lot of thieves and highwaymen in England and on the Continent in the AD 1000 era.. and for people to think you were mildly EVIL may have been enough for them to leave you alone and not mugg you.. so you developed an instrument to play that re-inforced that left handedness    I'm 69 years old and when I was in the FIRST GRADE all those years ago, I was LEFT HANDED... and the Nuns were concerned about that because it linked me with the Devil.. so they convinced my parents that they needed to change me to being a RIGHT HANDED PERSON to SAVE MY SOUL.. and THAT was in 1946

h9zzljmRaa	Yes, I guess that when I want to achieve something, I can become a bit demanding at times, but that is only because I want to achieve the goal.

UnMramoWaa	Keep it, he keeps the time you wasted.|`|klDiZgKQaa	I would sell it.|`|mQu7mXHAaa	Keep it,i've got all 3 of mine.(. joke.|`|Up6ANLQeaa	Nope...whats the point in keeping a keep sake of "what might have been"? I'd give it back.|`|Jnv47zQgaa	keep it or sell it    what ever you do just dont give it back.    he gave you that ring and he shouldn't want it back. and if he dose then he is a huge jerk and he dosn't deserve you and yeh|`|c82ecbef231aced5c49891502424aad3aa	if you don't get married and break up most woman give back the ring, but I know some woman will keep it and sell it.|`|ctNNzYW6aa	Yeah, I'd give it back if the break up was a mutual thing.  An engagement ring is an announcement that you intend to spend the rest of your life with a certain man. If you don't seal the deal and get married, then the engagement ring should be returned.  However, if a guy cheated on me and ruined my dream of a happy future, I'd be tempted to keep the ring just to make him suffer too.  That's human nature. But it seems kind of sad to keep a jewelry box full of broken dreams, doesn't it?|`|CEPI57vIaa	Haha YES! Well if it was a valuble one then definitely! But he bought it for me, so i should be expected to keep it coz if he were to get engaged to another woman, and i was that woman and i found out it was an ex's engagement ring, i'd be slightly pissed!|`|LBVme6Ucaa	If I were the one to end the engagement,I'd give the ring back.But if her were the one to end it cause he found another girl and cheated I'd keep it.|`|AA11523465	He was still paying on it, so giving it back was the proper thing to do.|`|caea98f7ed2871cd6caf9a1f351fc5ddaa	to quote jack sparrow  "take what you can  give nothing back"|`|jUEoujN2aa	well you better not cause that cost me $20 000! i want it back so i can get a refund|`|f2c691cb03d9d6b21303d0a416f0ad3daa	yes if its nice|`|DiBAWKPsaa	Keep it, sell it, don't let him get it back.|`|lwJF5DhHaa	yup  my ex got me a ring for my birthday long time ago  its not an engagement ring im wearing it right now   and yes its real :)|`|9d0f728b3338ed9ffccbf02630a332c3aa	If I broke off the engagement, I would give it back. If he broke it off, I wouldn't.|`|re06t6zvaa	yeah i would. he gave it to me & there's no way he could expect it back.|`|rcRoF7WNaa	I would offer to give it back but if he says 'no, you keep it' I would.  Would you want it to go on someone else's finger?|`|GkE1J8kGaa	Keep it and if you don't want it don't give it back Pawn it.|`|8VlDuMFOaa	I think giving it back to him would be the decent and right thing to do.  It wouldnt feel right to wear it if you had broken up.|`|P4Jc76GPaa	Anytime you break up with your partner and they have given you an engagement ring, you are supposed to return it. Even if they request that you keep it, you are still supposed to return it. It's just good manners and morally right.|`|bc1af16c01f9baa9730a6de2c0ca235caa	depends on how we part ways. If he did something cold-blooded me and that ring would be visiting the pawn shop|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	If by keep it you mean pawn it, yes.|`|FIvA9OVxaa	im a guy but if i were you i would keep the ring if its nice enough|`|RfN75ut1aa	keep it !!     or     sell it !!       never give it back !!|`|ICRWH76Yaa	me being a guy, i would want it back
cgfE0yyzaa	Kinda hard to pick. ICHIKO always does an up-beat themes for Zero no Tsukaima, kinda fits for comedy magic show like that and her vocal is unique, you could always tell it's her. Out of the 3 theme songs for Zero no Tsukaima, I like it probably the second, the first being "First Kiss" as it's more catchy.    The new Toradora! opening "silky heart" is a solo by Yui Horie. I first when I listen to the full song, I thought it's not as catchy as the first one "Pre-Parade", but after listening it with watching the opening sequence it gets better.    Out of the two, I'd say Toradora's 2nd opening song is better for me since I do like several other songs by Yui Horie.|`|KyOP56Xsaa	toradora.    =]|`|ZII6YCk1aa	I personally Like Tora Dora better.|`|n0lJ2aiAaa	code geass theme song is the best or the bleach theme song of season 2... but out of those 2 i prefer da toradora one|`|BJVtQbLKaa	I like Toradora better.

In a shallow pan, add 2 cups of the flour.   Season with salt and pepper.   In another shallow bowl, whisk the egg and milk together.  Season with salt and pepper. Dredge the rabbit in the seasoned flour.   Dip the rabbit in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off.  Dredge the rabbit back in the seasoned flour, coating completely.   In a large hot oven proof skillet with a lid, render the bacon until crispy about 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove the crispy bacon from the pan and reserve.   Lay the rabbit skin side down in the hot bacon fat and brown the rabbit for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Remove the rabbit from the pan and set aside.   Add the onions to the bacon fat and saut for 2 minutes.   Add the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic, saut for 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the thyme and bay leaves.   Add the rabbit to the vegetable mixture.  Add the wine and chicken stock.  Bring the liquid up to a simmer and cover.  Cook the rabbit until very tender about 30 to 35 minutes skimming off the fat.  Remove the rabbit pieces from the pan and set aside.  Blend the remaining flour and butter together into a smooth paste.  Whisk the paste into hot liquid.  Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.   Add the rabbit back to the pan and continue to cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in the parsley.  Season with salt and pepper if needed.

TMArhxQCaa	There are some courses you can take on overcoming stage fright (thats what it is, even though in your case its limited to small, more personal situations, such as a classroom.) Try the online course @ the Learning Annex. Theres also plenty of books on the subject. Heck, you can even try hypnotherapy! Don't be discouraged. If you work hard at it, your anxiety will get better, and eventually may go away completely.     Good luck :)|`|7CznHRwIaa	practicing singing in front of a couple people your comfortable with first then add a couple people you've never sang to|`|2xPWnuhVaa	If you had time I could help you.

ZKHaLbdEaa	Occasionally.  But more often, I will mentally recall another's joke, or a situation that I find hilarious, and start laughing uncontrollably out of nowhere.    For instance, yesterday at work, I remembered a story that made headline news in our town.  A man was walking home from a party and crapped his pants.  He removed his pants, placed them in a plastic bag, and threw the bag over the wall of the reservoir he happened to be walking past.  Several hours later, the police shut down traffic surrounding the area, as HazMat came to investigate the strange package near the reservoir.  Turns out it was only crapped pants, but the dude left his wallet in them.  He was arrested and charged with littering, and will forever live in Erie's history as the guy who crapped his pants at the reservoir.    Now THAT"S funny.|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	I laugh too often and inappropriately most of the time.

6e6gtaenaa	It depends. If the question was an actual question and I thought I gave a good, thorough answer and I got a thumbs down then I get mad.

74st3qQMaa	Some do but on others they can come across pretty normal. The Cousin Amy is on to give a different perspective. She isn't part of the Quiverfull movement and she is Jimbob's Sister's daughter.   A lot of time the Duggar children spit out the party line when answering questions so it is hard to know what they are really thinking.  It will be more interesting to me to see how many split off from mom and dad's teachings and go do they're own thing.|`|bd023cea955952a6366f0a9965ea13caaa	I think they are weird too, I mean don't they believe the earth is only 6,000 years old or something?

Cheers  -Will|`|9iNCQkWlaa	In Europe i'd go for a Mercedes diesel  in N.America i'd go for a Ford Focus    Fact is i just went thru the process of buying a new car and bought a 2004 Toyota Echo based on known servicing and maintenance costs & it's a real money saver on gas to boot.|`|AA10409668	American ------------------|`|pNUtnoC8aa	American!!|`|VfYvJypEaa	European of course . All American cars are any good for is driving slowly down endless straight roads .|`|AMFajJCgaa	Stolen.|`|63dUOWFNaa	European for sure..    European cars are known for their speed and great interior and exterior.     American Muscle are known for their speed.....    I love them both but i go with European this time.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	European, any day! Volvo's make me drool...

Give me a break. Least you've heard of all of ours.|`|T0yKlEipaa	I like European...        >good luck!|`|9ko5WUFkaa	Japanese cars, eg Toyota, Mazda    They are reliable, have all the modern safety features, all the luxury features, great styling and are cheaper to repair.  European cars cost a fortune if they need parts and American cars are crap.  The only people that drive American cars are Americans - there is very little demand for them in the global market.|`|svkn0oQkaa	European, even the cheapest ones will outlast any American car|`|ixixbQTWaa	european|`|5F1UErrhaa	European definitely.

Some Japanese cars can really kick those European cars ***. No Joke i saw it in Youtube + Auto Salon.    Suzuki Swift GTi smack Ferrari In a race.  Nissan Puslar Single Turbo smack HSV CLUBSPORT V8 in a Drag Race....    And also, Japanese cars are both good for drag and drift racing and also for normal driving.    So i say Go JAPANESE!!!|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	american|`|dCMi5rjdaa	CHEVROLET|`|BT5PqbJWaa	i think asian cars but europe has more appeal i think.|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	Asian|`|mSnNKp8waa	i like the style of the euro cars..but the sad thing is...    audi,volvo,saab and mazda and a few others listed here are own in part bye u.s. car makers.|`|sTodQmGaaa	EUROPEAN!

It was so awesome to see my favorite book and characters come to the big screen!!! Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, Kristen Stewart, and the rest of the cast did a fantastic job! And Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner looked so HOT in the movie too!!! I think Twilight should totally get an Oscar award!|`|BJVtQbLKaa	I never watched it, but I heard that the book is way better than the movie.|`|2oPTgm9baa	The film was very low budget and nothing compared to the book, however Rob Pattinson made it for me! lets hope they up the budget for New Moon.That's just my opinion.|`|2n06vH0taa	Yes and yes. Though its not as good as the book, but it was still good compared to other movies, and plus the director wasn't allowed to spend heaps of money on it, though they said if twilight was good, then they could spend more money on the next movie.|`|ww4Byajcaa	yea i've seen and well it is out in the movies and stuff in aus , ans was alright but plz read the books they are soooooo much better than the m ovie and you will get da plot a bit better|`|YWmQKm9eaa	Why would you even ask that? It doesn't really keep up with the Oscars. Maybe a Kids' choice award, maybe.|`|w2Dui70Faa	Worst movie I have ever seen. It doesn't deserve to be an Oscar nominee, either.|`|TkrlmF2uaa	what is this movie you speak of? :S  i have never heard of it    sarcasm, people|`|18RphOP6aa	I have seen it many times and I loved it, however as much as I loved it, it's not worth an oscar nod but I am sure it will win some awards on the Teen Choice Awards|`|U41jaJmCaa	Yeah already seen it twice and loved it!!|`|Qhw2Sh3zaa	Iv seen it, it was good but nothing compares to the book. I wouldn't say it deserves any Oscars|`|AA12010003	I've watched twilight, and I hated it! I loved the book, but the movie - never! The movie itself is not worth to be an Oscar nominee, but I liked the music in the movie.|`|BCu8rER4aa	its amazing,...  i dont care about it being in oscars or not,...LOL|`|DWFMM23Caa	yep seen it, yep liked it, will watch the sequels when they are released. nope don't think it is oscar material.
ewswVOrTaa	I've often wondered about the hair-washing thing as well.  Maybe a few of them really do want to find out the paternity of their children and can't afford it, or want help with alcoholism etc., but the lie detector thing really is a complete joke.  I don't know much about lie detectors and whether they are really that reliable, but if there was even an inkling of doubt as to whether I would pass one, I wouldn't take one on national TV and then try to make myself out to be one of the "1%" it doesn't work for.    I still watch it, though lol|`|PCpMqpP3aa	the majority of people who appear on the jeremy kyle show are a breed that not a lot of people like to acknowledge they are scum who should be fertilised and any of there offspring should also be fertilised, do a lot of good for the uk, less benefits, no need to spend money trying to educate them|`|97KCRDotaa	ditto the last person, scum of the earth.

I may be the last generation to have owned one.   He had stripey trousers and a great big smile.

I can't shake the image of the idiots who wrote that crap. Apparently they have no desire for an education and will only end up hurting themselves in the long run. I would have slapped the kid who wrote the 1st one.|`|uFfGm3Fbaa	Hell no! It's just sick. You should be smart enough to know that!

bc2f9034a51968f2b5ca5dec19dc698caa	"hot" is someone you want to ravage sexually. lol. It's more of an animalistic sort of attraction. Purely physical.    "cute" CAN be sexual, but it's more subtle. It can have more to do with behavior, as well. Cute tends to also denote a sort of innocence that the other person gives off. Babies, children, toys, cartoons, etc. can be "cute", so it's not just sexual (although there are perverts out there who DO find them sexually attractive). I think innocence is the major factor in cuteness.|`|awi1UXI4aa	cute would be "a puppy is cute"  hot would be "man that girl is HOT!"    you wouldn't say that puppy is HOT! unless he had been out in the boiling sun all day. :-)|`|sMEni2Tdaa	Cute is someone who seems good looking, adorable, and well people you'd like to hang out with.

One oozes sexuality and the other has the girl next door quality.|`|kUAgI59Aaa	cute is baby cute.    hot is sexy hot.|`|6UyYzxRNaa	cute is someone who, you know, looks nice, is nice, and all that.    but hot is when he/she is so darn good-looking (even though many TV shows and books protray them to be biatchy or snobby)    I'd rather date a cute and nice guy rather than a hot and dumb guy. Plus, I wouldn't want the competition from other girls.    hope this helps! =)|`|1bkiNiwzaa	Cute is like Hello Kitty.  Hot is like Barbie.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	cute is like a lesser version of hot  sometimes its used to describe someone really ugly but you dont wanna be mean about it so you say cute|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Hot feels like someone is talking about you like a slab of meat.

There is a difference.|`|ZYJdpXEBaa	Cute is awwwwww  Hot is Yummy|`|kF9aHWfUaa	Hot turns u on.Cute doesnt.|`|dDSuBQURaa	Think of it this way: Hot is someone you are attracted to, while cute is for your younger siblings or relatives.|`|4SGBr8cWaa	cute is hot without the attitude|`|Bo2sxnqtaa	Cute is someone you would do and hang with...    Hot is someone you would do and date so you can do them over and over again|`|9CYpX1J8aa	hot is the typical big boobs and stuff  cute is usually more quirky|`|vkwbaZAAaa	cute is like little boy cute face  hot is a good looking teen

Prayers for everyone else. We all need them.    Liked the Happy Hump Day jokes yesterday. I am old enough to remember Abbot and Costello, even their TV show. I liked their Math routine also. It was in the movie Abbot and Costello Join the Navy.    jcm (Janet)|`|Qb61FHANaa	95.7 WRIT  fat cat rewards trivia - learn about great deals  video of the day - get smart  newsletter - james  slang word - yank my chain  lunch word - french onion dip  pick of day - bread  best net freebies trivia - ebay|`|WtjbCSnSaa	BEFORE   B  (Parking Attendant)  CHAMPIONS   A  (The New York Blue)  HISTORY  B  (Douglas Fairbanks)  QUOTE  A  (A Lie Told Often Enough Becomes Truth)  VIDEO OF THE DAY  -  Get Smart  MUSIC TRIVIA  -  N/A  SLEUTH TRIVIA  -  Keep    THUMBS UP EVERYONE!

WOW,,,,,and then she grew up !!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkYfAK73-...|`|joW2WI4Faa	I remember it as a pretty song but have no memory of the guitar solo you mention. However, on your "recommendation" I have now listened to it on YouTube. It was a "live" version - possibly different to the studio recorded version - and, yes, the guitar solo was nice ... without being particularly memorable. I've already forgotten it!|`|Mfi2lCxpaa	great song one of my favorites
2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	I am too. Its horrible here cause they randomly select which streets to plow so if you are lucky you have a clear block.      Shoot, it better not be like the Day after Tomorrow, I seen the ending.|`|LWEceVT4aa	No, I'm loving the snow.

Im annoyed that it didnt snow.    I live in grimsby and we were predicted to be hit worst.    All of these opther schools have closed like all week.  And we only got tuesday off.  And that wasnt even snow related.  Our water pipe burst.    Itys sucks,  This snow has been so overrated|`|186deac21531919b3fa042717df297e7aa	yes my love , nice to look at but thats all xxx|`|MCOlkzk6aa	exactly.  We keep waiting for it in Ga. but we never get it.  Good luck on your exams.  :)|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	No, not me, it only snowed about an inch yesterday...it never snows enough here to amount to anything..|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	Well, I've never experienced snow in my life. Sad but true. I live in India and the nearest snow themed park is in the neighbouring state and I wish soooooo much that it'd snow here.  Also, even though it's just Feb, you can perspire just sitting in a room with open doors and windows :(|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Haha! I suppose you have a point there. But, to be honest, l am glad l've had the day off of school Tuesday and Thursday becoz they're my college days also, and lt's so boring. Sooo, Really, it will stop soon ;) xxx|`|h6rf1Ke5aa	nope  i love it! hope we have more  i just hope they wouldn't close the schools  i kind of miss going =\|`|qC4MVnkoaa	PDA ARE NOT WHITE LIKE SNOW|`|dEJrBR68aa	I loved the snow but I'm not at all impressed with all the nasty slippery ice it's left behind!|`|vDp62eS1aa	I had 4 snow days, from Monday - Thursday (today)!!! It rocks.|`|sbmzMVLraa	I know what you mean.    Yes I am getting fed up with the snow as I was at college on monday and it started snowing so we got to go home at 12:30 but I was supposed to do a talk for my English class after lunch so I did not get to do this, on Tuesday the college was closed but there was NO snow, yesterday I was back at college and today I am at college and it is snowing at the moment.    Have a good day.|`|EHw2UjqVaa	i'm not working today because i'm getting my carpet delievered. ;)|`|mxA0tYppaa	i know the feeling....i haven't worked all week cause of the stuff...|`|nwdwKnS7aa	No, I love the snow.

X3Mbmpqjaa	I think its awesome!! Takes a little while to clock whats going on, but I really liked it. Funnily enough...|`|uTnJ4o2Saa	I have not, but by its name, I'll read into it.        Am I right in guessing that in leaving theatres,   audiences will know as little about it  as they had upon entering?|`|AA11601079	I actually saw this in theaters (because my friend's boyfriend's second cousin had a small speaking part and he dragged us to see it). I was supremely disturbed by this movie. It didn't bother me that so many different actresses played Aviva, but the whole premise of this young girl getting pregnant and running off with a truck driver named Bob or something completely disturbed me. Plus, the trite summary about not being able to change who you are - totally cheesy and insulting to the viewers' intelligence.

If the bbc want revenue why don't they get off their lazy butts and earn it. But its all to easy to sit back and earn huge salaries on the backs of millions of low paid hard  working people whom may only have the tv for pleasure as they cannot afford to do much else. Pay your licence or else you will go to court, you know we are watching you.|`|hVuPqHzsaa	I hate anything like that|`|hYTkSCf2aa	we dont pay out tv license to watch dancing on ice its only for the bbc channels i doubt there will be more ppl complain than actually watch it either|`|d1a26bdbe60e7f3b4dfb03becde36b2eaa	Dancing on Ice is a ITV program - we don't pay a licence for these channels advertisement pays for these.  Our Licence is for the BBC that's why they don't have adverts.  But i do agree the reality show has gone to far - they key is for everyone to switch off, but we don't we keep watching because there is nothing else on so they keep making them.|`|dAn9koABaa	no chance . but you can bet that something interesting will would not be on so long|`|8dhe15MUaa	your more chance of a heat wave here in uk this dinner time|`|caea98f7ed2871cd6caf9a1f351fc5ddaa	probably not ,i'm thinking of cancelling my licence altogether|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	I didn't realise it was an ITV guff either. Never would watch it. Maybe we could moan about that Strictly Come Dancing instead.|`|AA11569882	I am offended by the mere fact that we have to pay a tv licence just for a handful of channels, when all the other channels do just fine without.  And I am very much opposed to the huge wages of certain bbc employees.  I've never watched dancing on ice, or any of the other dancing shows or celebrity shows!  I'm fed up with them!|`|smA22aNHaa	I agree the licence fee is unjust as it targets the poorest people for the right to own a TV? It is an outdated law and should be amended at least.|`|6pjmQ4d7aa	It has to be offensive!!!!!!!!!    I HATE IT
MlCWsBcwaa	Lord of the Rings first and foremost.  There are a lot of good ones e.g. Indiana Jones, Tom Clancy/Jack Ryan movies (Hunt for the Red October, Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games etc), Jaws and Star Wars.

I'd wait until after, so at least they don't have to be alone during.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	Yes you should dump them before Valentine.    A research show that most people break up on Valentine, which I feel is very cruel.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	before, not on it, thats mean|`|ICRWH76Yaa	or wait it out to see if you get lucky|`|SXqYdNpsaa	Do it before.. like in the next couple of days|`|WoEsehoRaa	Absolutely end it ASAP. It's gonna hurt enough without you being mean about it.|`|WlnOmo1maa	-- before -- for your own sake in case she already has some emotional attachment to you, you don't want to have any history for her to fantasize about your future together, sometimes it's cruel to be kind so go ahead and make the cut now
3d6119cf4a9df27c12f9843ac9018153aa	It is encased in fluid,and when said fluid drys up (dehydrates) due to unforeseen circumstances eg hangover , the brain rattles around like a peanut.

When you have a head ache, you actually have been shot in the butt by a farmer with a shotgun, and the brain signals get confused and you think you have a head ache.    Check yourself over, there will be something far worse wrong with you, this is your brain's way of telling you...    I am lucky, I have voices in my head to tell me this stuff, they keep the brain pains away.

e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	I don't think that's racist, just a matter of opinion. One of the most beautiful women I have ever seen was they darkest black girl I have ever seen. She was absolutely gorgeous! I think all skin complexions can be beautiful, I'm pale as a ghost and it's not all its cracked up to be.     And I'm sure your beautiful!|`|4bZZmprqaa	FoR ReAl|`|sTodQmGaaa	Nah, if she went and teased the girl for having dark skin or refused to talk to her for her colour - then yes i would see that as racist.     Your friend is obviously just attracted to light skinned people, we all have our likes and dislikes in looks.    E.g I love dark features with light eyes so when i see a guy like that *drools* but to others they might find that as unattractive.      Take care|`|5F1UErrhaa	I'm white, and I love dark skin.  And I don't see that as being racist to other whites because of being that race myself.    Same as when Indians make Indian jokes to me, they're only putting their own race down not someone else's, which seems to make it more funny somehow.    So I don't really see it as racist unless the girl (your friend) is white and talking about a dark girl.|`|sbmzMVLraa	Yes it is racist as someone should not make fun of someone else who has different colour of skin to themselves. How would your friend like it if the girl who you where talking about said something about your friend's colour of skin BEHIND her back.|`|0ii4V9bEaa	YES!!!|`|sarUn38haa	People are so sensitive when it comes to racism, obviously you have to be careful but racism has become so difficult to define, people will consider anything that refers to the tone of someones skin as racist.  If you want my opinion, i do not consider what you were referring to as racist, however you should be careful because others may not agree.|`|aTZF7ey7aa	Yes it is racist, it don't matter if you are sky blue or pink. the colour of your skin makes no difference you should have respect to all nations of the world.|`|0WwnOPOvaa	I think it's good at your age to question and do a self examination to find out what your feeling are. In the example you give,I don't see that a racist.  Just remember this Hun, beauty is only skin deep.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	no|`|8uvq2lU4aa	Some times people just have preferences. when it comes down to attraction, everyone discriminates to a degree.if it bugs you, break it down with them. if they really are a racist you'll be able to smash there argument to pieces if not, you might enlighten them abit. good luck.|`|9iNCQkWlaa	No but it's definitely something to do with the Indian Caste system saying anything else ...I'd only be guessing|`|iE7nwMVnaa	Yeah, I consider this a little racist yeah. Cause she is saying that dark people can't be pretty and that is not true.|`|3TsO2UWRaa	well yea i see it as racist  im a beaner =P so thats plenty racist D=  unless if there's a dark person with blonde hair... not to be racist|`|ccZuEOEfaa	Yes, a little bit. It's not excessively racist, like "omg, she's black, she's so ugly". That would be REALLY racist.  But it does have like racist undertones - especially the "but she's dark". That's definitely racist.  And you're right, you can be pretty if you have dark skin. I know a lot of dark-skinned people who are WAY prettier than I am, and I am very fair-skinned.|`|sMEni2Tdaa	Soo...you're friend is Indian?  Than isn't she [[most likely]] also "dark"?
TZiySTOGaa	yes my mother has stolen a few things from me.. a dgital camera... almost 4000 pounds (yes four thousand pounds) private letters and then she destroyed them afterwards... and lots of other things too... all by my mother|`|WESy9DkAaa	Yeah My Boyfriend Stole Money off me I didnt Screw at him He need it Tbh.  He did say Sorry though.|`|p3rnyBoYaa	I had a room mate for 4 months, when she moved out some nick knacks were taken as well as some old silver quarters that I had been accumulating.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	yes money|`|khnMoQNoaa	my sister stole my tv  years ago|`|LsEyhvOtaa	Yes, money and items - one of my brothers was a thieving git!|`|ADgnjlXHaa	My favorite video game. My cousin :(|`|RyE0Ki6Gaa	Yeah, the chavs that stole my doorbell WTF|`|VpG8q7yuaa	Yes.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Yea some kids in the neighborhood needed money for pot, stole the tool boxes, scanner, video camera, 2 other cameras. Next time they needed more, so the video game consule and all the games got taken. I left my bag to run into a restaurant and they busted the window and got my bag, the glass was almost still in motion I walked in turned around to get my purse and it was already gone. 2 sets of diamonds earings my daughters inheirted, some kids needed pot again. Most likely firends of my kids lovely eh?|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Yes, expensive necklace by a male friend (???)  Money   and money again.     I let these people know that i knew they took it and have kept them out of my life. Our friends know and they either dropped them or are very wary of them now and also know they are not to be at one of my outings.|`|IHa6FxE6aa	Yes. Money, belongings etc.|`|hVuPqHzsaa	No|`|mUed9bXYaa	not me personally  but my 'friend' stole 2 of my brothers wallets and at least 20 from my dad  he's also stolen from HIS OWN family  and another of my friends|`|7SJ3cY48aa	I was in maths and dropped my eraser pen. I totally forgot about it and a few minutes later I needed it. I was looking around my chair trying to find it then noticed the boy sitting next to me had it in his pencil case. I waited until he left his seat and stole it back! He didn't notice so it was fine!|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	Unfortunately, yes.|`|daij1eBCaa	Not me but once my mom's aunt stole money out of her purse at my grandmother's funeral. I thought that was pretty low. ?|`|gwjBvXTbaa	Not from someone I know ... but my phone was stolen once ... not that it did them any good because I called into Verizon to stop the service to the phone.|`|l05exvJvaa	Someone in school stole a book from me|`|ne2sEeLJaa	Yes. These horrible people that were in my Art & Design class, they stole my work, so I could fail.  This was just after that I got into this Other College after an interview.   The people in my class didn't like it for some reason, they were jelous because I was more creative then them.    I got it back in the end. Heartless *****.  They didn't even bother to say sorry or anything.
JOAPnhOgaa	not so expensive but it was a beautiful glass statue engraved with a heart  for valentines day for this guy who i was really in love with  only to find out that same statue was a valentines day present from him to his wife!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    so he gave my token of love to his wife ( i had no idea he was married)|`|RyE0Ki6Gaa	Yeah, it was a big stuffed white tiger.  I regretted it...because well she's probably thrown it away now lol  what a waste of money|`|AA11569882	Yup, the first gift I bought my boyfriend was this mp3 player, it was about 60, and I was only 17 so it was quite a lot of money.  And I didn't know him well enough at the time to realise that he is terrible with gifts!  He always wants to take them back, so he took it back to the shop and I had a sulk...  Now I don't really buy him gifts anymore, I have to make sure he is with me because otherwise he'll only complain that it's the wrong colour, or the wrong shape, or something like that!|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Never|`|TZiySTOGaa	i brought my ex an expensive watch, i regretted it a few days later when he went to work with it on and broke it... what a pleb!|`|KnFElHEKaa	Everyone makes that mistake... Ring for an ex a month later|`|KOsGtal8aa	yes, a packet of chewing gum for my sister. haha|`|v40ELyB5aa	When I was 16 I bought my boyfriend of three years a personal DVD player worth 100...(a lot of money considering I didn't have a job) only to find out he was actually sleeping with my best friend .    Awesome .|`|jkXYlKJzaa	yup though i didnt regret it so much as i missed the money|`|5AwLW1buaa	Bought my second girlfriend an iPod Nano ($159) after knowing her only 3 weeks.    My first date with my first girlfriend cost me ($200) - went to a show and had an expensive meal...    You resent it because people can never give you enough thanks for such grand gestures. If the person is decent, they will know the real prize is in the thought put into the gift, and not it's RRP.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	yes

We always do...lol. ?|`|hritHZZcaa	yes its wrong!|`|NT08sMBpaa	No. Men are never wrong.|`|PdmSmTYdaa	You could have just said outright that the rugby is more important to you than she is, I'm sure she wouldn't mind.        www.getreadyforaspeartackle.com|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Yes just tell the truth.  Otherwise she will never know how important the rugby is to you and she won't get to know the real you.|`|KPFBbi06aa	no you did the right thing how can she be so selfish tell her you will join them after the match and to make sure they are ready and waiting for you|`|7fa275a0b219d341645d003c4f5add6baa	Yes you are wrong !!! What's wrong with telling her the truth ???  If she fouind out you lied then she would never believe another word that came out of your mouth !!!!!    Are you scared of her or something ??  Tell the truth !!!  If she doesn't like it then that's her problem.|`|QltaXcKUaa	Absolutly not!     But she should understand that Rugby is just more important to you and let u off.|`|RyE0Ki6Gaa	Well, it was wrong that you lied  you should have just told her you wanted to watch the 6 nations rugby thingy  but if you think she would have dumped you for it then I would have done the same thing lol    ...but then again...can't you watch the repeat?! Or record it?
JOAPnhOgaa	i think its a biscuit :))|`|5F1UErrhaa	A cake, it's too soft to be a biscuit.|`|2oPTgm9baa	i would file it more towards the bread category.|`|h044Tbj5aa	it's bread with currants in|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	cake|`|hBcDpl7Vaa	That's a hard one. ^.^|`|hviykDAraa	Cake espeically birthday cake - i could eat that all day!!

E9ZLxgsOaa	I hear the 2shoes family is concerned.|`|DQHC3EZuaa	yess  i mean people dont really like her but cos she is a celeb people just feel sorry for her cos cancer aint no joke but i understand how other people also get cancer but we only notice her because of her fame  =D|`|gPvOcB6oaa	I too am consumed with indifference|`|iE7nwMVnaa	To be honest you've got a point, when all other people are dying from cancer, do all the other 'celebs' or the news go and publish everything about them. No! Just because they are are T.V and have done something petty to become famous they have to broadcast the 'shocking news' everywhere.    But, I still feel sorry for her, (as a person) for having cancer, because it is a terrible thing to have.|`|ClCQIjZHaa	It don't matter who it is know one should go through that|`|aOjMf5SPaa	I do care, but why is she more important than Mrs Jones down the road who is going through the same thing.|`|I5cF2hXdaa	Cancer is a terrible thing regardless of situation and the person. Every time i hear a story or about someone with cancer like this it makes me feel bad inside.|`|pTmUycXzaa	Yes I care.  She's a person and the mother of small children. I care about her and anyone else I know of who is suffering.|`|xEJm0NCiaa	you have made a good point, she hasn't done us much good to anyone. though to be really honest, im not really bothered about it. now she is making a big deal of having cancer, i see her face in every news paper, she wants to be remembered and sympathised, its pathetic.|`|10knD5g0aa	maybe you should try and learn someting from it becasue you never know when death and illness will affect you and the ones YOU love.. dont be so f**king cold hearted and mean, she is, after all, only human, she didnt ask for it did she!!!|`|TZiySTOGaa	i do feel very sorry for her, i know a few people who have suffered with cancer and died as a result, it is the worst battle anyone can go through, noone deserves to have the disease, she maynot be everyones cup of tea, i for one think she is very irritating, but i feel very sorry for her having to go through this and feel sorry for the children she is going to leave behind, the same with patrick swayze, i feel very sorry for him too... and anyone else in the world, famous or not famous that has the disease|`|Z6tqdAoGaa	I wouldn't wish cancer on anyone,but I see it as a come uppance for her racial attributes.She's a vile specimen of life and got what she deserved.I know I shouldn't say something like this but thats the way I feel.|`|olSoKaioaa	I care, in that anything that keeps the ***** in the news is a bad thing, once she's gone nobody will remember her.|`|9ADVLFOnaa	It's not something you would wish on anyone and she has small children who will be left without a mother. You also have to remember when it's making the news it might make one more woman go and get screened for cervical cancer and that could save their life, that's the positive of it being in the news. I don't really like her either but I would never wish something like that on her so I refuse to have a go at her.|`|PHKSoUTDaa	We don't even condemn paedophiles, rapists and murderers to death, let alone show your inhuman concern for a 27 year old mother suffering a slow lingering death watched by her young children!!    I despair for the human race with examples like you around!|`|iddMxOroaa	I don't care either and the only reason she is doing the TV show is so that she can make some money out of it and make sure that her kids have a chance at a  better future, feel for the kids, but jade not that much|`|JOAPnhOgaa	i care no matter who it is who has cancer|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	Yes thousands of other people have died from cancer, but I couldn't name one of them or put a face to them.  It doesn't matter what Jade has done with her life, she has two young kids who are going to lose their mother.|`|hBcDpl7Vaa	Yes I do care I care for everyone who has cancer and Jade is one of the cancer victims. If someone doesn't care for someone who has cancer then there disguisting sorry.|`|qRM0r7eVaa	I couldnt care less if I tried I dont know the woman..whats the point of caring?|`|HvXIy6Taaa	I care no more or less than for any other person.. Some people seem glad which is a bit much but I found it ridiculous when Kylie Minogue had cancer and there was this outpouring of national grief.    It's sad but it happens to a lot of people, it's more sad that some people don't seem to notice until it happens to a "celebrity"|`|4df9a4b43e6a8126c7fef5402bfd401aaa	You care enough to have posted this question.......I agree, millions of people go through it. She should not be making a reality TV show out of it. It gives the impression that she is begging for sympathy, people will sympathise with her anyway because what she is going through is tough, I hope she recovers from it.|`|ff7fc6889663558c1c97fb10a9748022aa	She's not really in my thoughts only when i see her in the paper or on the news, i feel sorry for her, like her or not cancer is a sad thing in any ones life.|`|sbmzMVLraa	No you are not the only one as I don't care that she is going through cancer as I do not like her.  A friend of my mum and dad died of cancer so I was a bit upset at that as my sisters and I have known him and his wife since we where small.|`|hviykDAraa	i feel for her becasue it cannot be a nice experience buit im bloody well sick of hearing about it!! So many people have the disease and just get on with it and arnt in the papers and magazines everyday!!|`|WS9TooJKaa	I care. But I don't know personally, so not as much as if it were a friend/family/someone I know in real life. Of rather no-one had it, it's always a shame to hear someone has cancer.|`|50a3a6962995695708b9dd7368acc991aa	Of course people care,  she is a human being going through an horerendous time, and don't forget she is a mother who has two young children who are facing the possibilty of growing up without her, so whatever you think about her personally just try and remember that before you judge her and how worthy her life is in your opinion. Cancer is a devastating disease that has touched most people in some way and I think you should have sympathy for everybody who find themselves in this terrible situation|`|RyE0Ki6Gaa	I guess it's just karma.|`|1sP3dJlnaa	Care less than I would about any other person.    Wouldn't wish it on anyone but I can't stand the stupid racist tramp.    She doesn't deserve sympathy, good riddance and good luck to her kids, hope they have a proper role model to grow up with.|`|FrHVJSB8aa	i am sure that there are people who do care- her family and friends for instance. she is not my favourite but all the same i would not wish the dreaded cancer on anyone except an older brother.jade is a  known entity because of the publics weird fascination with all things different. she cant help the fact that she has made fame and fortune out of the public watching dull ,meaningless tv programmes like the one that shot her to celebrity status.i cant even remember what it was called. i have watched several people die from cancer and its not nice.i hope for her and her families sake she manages to beat it although it doesnt look likely.|`|AA11036069	Totally agree.    I feel sorry for her, as I would for anybody who is very ill, but I don't see why it's "headline news".

DJyvETGgaa	Let him go ... You will hurt yourself if you will fight for your Love ....If your love is true , you will still love him even though away from him and may be someday he will realize... But for now let hm go .. There is no point forcing someone to stay ....!!!!|`|AA10423276	i went thru the same thing with my husband. we were engaged for 5 years and he started an affair with this other girl in between. i found out a few months before marriage but my husband denied it and said he only liked her but wants to be with me. so we got married and after 2 months i found out they are still talking on the phone and stuff. i found out on our anniversary day 14th feb. that was cruel. god i was broken hearted. that girl claimed my husband had proposed her in the past and they were both madly in love. my hubby denied it again. he said he just liked her as a friend. i believed my hubby again and later on found emails of my hubby sent to her over the period of 3 years in which he had told her he loves her and wants to marry her.   i could either fight for my love or just let him go. i decided to fight. after all i was the wife. and i thought my husbands loved me more than he loved her. so i'd say you fight for it if you feel your bf loves you more. but make sure first that he loves you more and you love him more too. and then work on mending your relationship.|`|KOsGtal8aa	if he cheated, then dump him.|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Don't give up without a fight. He has a silly crush. show that woman who's boss.|`|cgqgomawaa	He doesn't love you in the same way you love him or he wouldn't have done this to you. He's not worth your tears, time or indeed love.|`|DiBAWKPsaa	Leave him, he's cheated on you once, most likely he will do it again.  stupid lying pig. [him not you]|`|xBOQMqU0aa	leave him.. let him go if he comes back.. he is ur love.. if he'll not... he was not of ur category|`|rptP7ynpaa	let him go.  i let everyone go after awhile|`|kzoUGdg0aa	Leave him, he can't have his cake and eat it. Your boyfriend probably feels big headed now that 2 girls love him, you can't go on being with him when you know he likes someone else, you should leave him before he decides to leave you.    This guy doesn't sound like the type of guy you should fight for because if he really loved you he wouldn't want anyone else.|`|K19lBLhWaa	let him go.. i would NEVER date a cheater, cause i would always imaging them with someone else.. whether i wanted to or not..|`|n0qM84T9aa	Let the pig go, cause your gonna live in limbo wonder if he loves or cares about you. You deserve wayyyyyyy better than him. No need to glue yourself to a cheating pig like him...just my opinion.    good luck|`|ccOJn7q8aa	leave him|`|AA12036375	You should dump him and find someone that loves only you. Don't settle for someone that is only going to give you half of himself. Let him go running to her. He will keep doing the same thing if you keep him. You can do better than that and deserve better than that.  GOOD LUCK !!

9xgGd9praa	Creepy, just so weird. I don't get why Mothers would be happy to watch their little innocent girls prance about in front of perverts in little swimming suits, I would ban them.|`|7soGu2emaa	I think its cute! But only if the little girl actually likes it!|`|2q1XI0j9aa	i think they are horrible, and stage moms are biznatches|`|LRLu1ofNaa	they are horrible, encouraging little girls to be fake|`|dOgpCN7Vaa	I think they are a very bad idea because all it seems to be is the mothers living their own dream lives through their daughters. This only puts pressure on these little girls to do well so that they can please their mothers instead of making themselves happy.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	I see them as a form of "white slavery", to watch those little girls trying so hard to live up to their mothers dreams and goals....and not live up to their own dreams is so sad.  It seems the mothers live through their daughters because they failed to achieve a title when they were younger.  Horribe torture.|`|8eCyY7RCaa	Disgusting!
6Ch7vbKfaa	No, they did NOT.  Bravo.  They did the right thing for a change.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	No, Johnny came to his senses. But, he is still guilty of it in my book, he might as well done the deed.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	Nope, they did not do it.|`|sJs0nuTSaa	They didn't.  Johnny stopped.  I'd like to believe that Maxie would have stopped sooner or later, but one never knows about her.  To be clear, they did not have sex.|`|AA12315431	No, Johnny stopped it before they could get any clothes off. My opinion of Johnny was going way down, then it went back up a couple of notches but I still don't like that they almost had sex for the ridiculous reasons they were discussing. How lame.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Almost but no. What do you mean poor Lulu? She has no right to try to change Johnny and he can do so much better than her.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	No no  they didn't, but they were about to,,,they had it all "logically" figured out  lol.  If Johnny and Maxie made love, it would run Lulu and Spinelli off, for  "their own protection" in the long run.  I could see Maxie jumping on Johnny, since after all, she doesn't have a boyfriend, but, Johnny has a "love",  what is the matter with these two crazy kids!|`|fIWwLRIMaa	no they didn't, johnny stopped before anything happened more than kissing.|`|wQfo0thwaa	Johnny got an attack of conscience and they stopped.  According to Maxie, she would have kept going, but I think Maxie has a decent streak she is desperately trying to cover up.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	No, they stopped themselves. They both figured they hurting the ones they love wasn't going to solve anything. But there was still a little chemistry left in the room....|`|EhBF31evaa	No they did not.  I didn't think they would.  It is nice to see that Maxie is finally becoming a nicer person with a few morals.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	no they didn't, but it's coming soon.  They won't be able to fight it & Lulu will find out & run straight into the arms of Ethan Lovett|`|M1ymLE9Paa	No, they didn't.  Thank goodness.|`|ImQPqxEgaa	I put this cut and paste because I think it is funny how matter-of-fact it is written:    Lulu wondered why Johnny wasn't banging on the (hospital) doors, trying to get in.Could have been because he was passionately kissing Maxie at the garage. But the duo found the willpower not to go any further. Maxie said it would be better for Spinelli if she let him go to Winifred. Johnny insisted he was trying to protect Lulu from his secret, but admitted having sex would not have solved anything. Maxie was surprised that she made a good choice  hurting Spinelli would just kill her. And she pointed out that Johnny stopped himself because he loves Lulu. Maxie recapped her faults (like supplying Lucky with drugs), but Johnny pointed out that she's been a good friend to Spinelli and Lulu. Maxie hinted she would have gone through with the sex. Johnny decided to put chains on the car and head back to town. In Johnny's car, Maxie explained the difference between weather and climate while Johnny didn't think it was a good idea to take Maxie home after their kiss. They happened upon Robin's abandoned minivan.....|`|djQ6UyzIaa	Ohhhhhh haha! When you said GH I thought you meant Guitar Hero! But obviously you meant General Hospital. Please be more specific in the future.|`|4BWpeIUraa	I thought they didn't, but http://www.soapcentral.com/gh/scoop.php says they did! So who knows...  I like Johnny and Lulu together. I hope they don't separate them. It will be stupid after what they've been through with Logan.

HkSSJXE9aa	This video can be interpreted as one about coming to terms with the loss of a friend. Whatever the cause for loss, the person struggles with their emotions (represented by them trying to solve the Rubik's Cube). By the end, they have placed the cube in a case and placed it in a giant vending machine, which symbolizes that they will keep "forever" these memories as they move on. The video could be viewed as an interactive element on UK CD1, the first time this feature was available on a Spice Girls CD.|`|AA11777484	I think they geared that video towards children...I don't fully understand it either.

Christian Bale plays a tap dancing newsboy in a Disney musical directed by the guy who eventually gave the world "High School Musical." The movie is absolutely awful, as in the worst editing I've ever seen on screen. But I dare you to find one Gen X woman who hasn't seen it.

5LxpvXSmaa	Yes i think they are. Most kids now a days can quote most of the lines for the Breakfast Club because they ring so true.   I grew up watching Gidget and that i knew was't real life and the 80's and 90's did show more real life then when we were younger. Kids grow up a lot faster now.|`|tLI94qWNaa	I think that it depends on the person, me myself I dont relate to any of the characters in any of those movies such as the breakfast club, sixteen candles and etc...  I always hated how you never saw a depressed person, or someone who suffers from an eating disorder.  It was always about these teenagers who fall in love with the perfect man.  That is not what high school is like.  So no, I dont think that they are that relevant.  I think movies like thirteen and saved are more relevant movies.|`|7kpiZqNbaa	i think 1960 are relepance|`|HGEqQSQLaa	yes   i am sixteen and the breakfast club, 16 candles, and pretty in pink have been 3 of my favorite movies since i was 12|`|QGkaMovlaa	ofcourse!|`|x7vB4P5Naa	Yeah, I think it's still relevant.  The jock, the nerd, the princess, etc....those "types" of people are still in school's today.|`|Pg1pqrJ6aa	Yeah, and it always will be.  The Breakfast Club is just a timeless cult-classic.  The only difference is just the names.  Instead of jocks we have meatheads.  etc...|`|tnE0JiiKaa	no way far from today and teens today. This society has more technology and deals with way more things that are now exposed to young people. I dont know nothing is private anymore.|`|TxRRITveaa	yep, no matter how much things change, they stay the same.|`|bn8OZrYSaa	Ofcourse it is...i think the basis of the movies is what teens really go through in school..perfect example..|`|lJZNGsZCaa	Yes, there will always be a stereotype structure to the social side of schools, the jock, nerd, freak, dropout and how they always clash against one another.Plus there will always be detention.|`|AA11601079	I don't know. I watched it for the first time when I was a freshman in high school back in 1990, and I didn't relate to the characters then. They just didn't reflect my experiences, or even my high school, at all.    I think teenagers today would relate better to something like "American Teen," which showed more interactions among the teens over a greater length of time. There were more subtleties and complexities going on in a movie like that one, and I think it's a more accurate portrayal of teenagers both then and now.

kIblsxJQaa	She was married and so was Grant Bovey and he also had small children.

This idea was later copied/used by the french, where they lined the roads with trees that lead to a monument or in gardens that lead to the main building/castle/chateau...    The most famous of these is the Champs-lyses which leads to the Arc de Triomphe.     In modern terms roads and streets dont have lines of trees, but Avenues do. the word avenue is french in origin meaning leading/coming to.

AA10289523	This has already happened  Read this then check the link      Dark Claw is a fictional Amalgam Comics superhero. He is a combination of Marvel Comics' Wolverine and DC Comics' Batman who exists only in the temporary Amalgam Universe created when the DC and Marvel Universes combine. Dark Claw's first real appearance was in Legends of the Dark Claw  1 (1996), though his first (metafictional) appearance in the Amalgam Universe was in Sleuth Comics  27. Combining two of each universe's most popular characters was quite successful, as Dark Claw proved to be one of the most memorable and popular creations of the Amalgam Universe.|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	I believe they call him Dark Claw, but to be honest it'd literately be the most absurd concept ever. Not saying that it wasn't epic, awesome and just simply cool for them to do it, but in the literal sense, the existence of an amalgamation between batman and wolverine is absurd for the sheer fact that this character would be the ultimate killing machine that cannot, on principles, kill any body. I believe you'd be able to call it true irony, but it's so freakn hard to define irony so i'm not entirely sure. Lol.|`|4AbXxowTaa	He would not only be rich and geared up proper, he would be tough and have the titanium claws as well.|`|mcfjahWxaa	That'll be really cool! They should be called "BatRine" or "WolveMan"..LoL!|`|oq8F1qfUaa	cool.|`|e6TZcaWnaa	It's like the the wolerine dressed in  Batmans outfit it could totally happen!|`|HvXIy6Taaa	That IS overly cool..|`|vhztcQkXaa	awesome, but then again what would really happen to them two heroes fusing together to make one would batman take over or wolverine or combined would they both be in the same body...risky

Anyone can loop a bass beat; you gotta keep it real, fly prince.|`|zP4ZhXxEaa	It's easy to practice the art of freestyle rhyme because you can do it anywhere at anytime.. Wherever you are spit a few bars about your surroundings, even if it doesn't rhyme or flow in some lines, you'll get better.    Listening to some real hip hop.. I suggest you listen to some Biggie smalls, chino xl, immortal technique, serius jones and nas.    If you want to practice your text skills you should check out http://www.spokenvswritten.com, some good freestylers and texters on there.

R7w0uJbfaa	You would have to increase your lung capacity, the best way to do this is by swimming a heck of a lot, especially swimming under water.  Practicing holding your breath under water for longer and longer periods of time the more you practice.    You can also breath in as much air as possible with as many breaths in as you can take.  Hold the air in for as long you feel comfortable with, and than release the air at a relaxed pace.|`|AQFwSLgiaa	It all comes from your stomach.  Thats where you produce the sound.  The more you practice from there the better at being louder you get|`|vjB9ARWmaa	turn the mic up or go for death metal lol :)|`|UXuSI6EZaa	do your vocal practice neck-deep in a pool or at the beach & try hitting top notes until you can hear the improvement. works like a charm

The trash would never be tanked out and our house would smell like a dumpster.    So guys would starve to death if we didn't cook for them.

lK3ooHWQaa	I'm a bit surprised at this question and some of the answers. I have Sun/Venus/Mars/Mercury in Pisces, and I have never met a Sagittarius online or off that I do not like. I find them honest (that is what gets them in trouble) but I also find them fair, and they stimulate me intellectually.    I do like people who are like myself, but I am fascinated with people who are different from me. Maybe it's my Uranus in the 9th that causes me to be this way. I'm not sure why you find your friend stupid and annoying, but we will clash with someone in our lifetimes. I will say this about a Sagittarius (or Virgo)... if they are pointing out faults or critiquing you, it means they still like you enough to do that and want to understand where you're coming from, even if they won't admit it to themselves.     It would probably be best to distance yourself from the Sag if you can't find any common ground whatsoever.|`|ETGMj8Hoaa	argg isabelle put zzzzzzzzz in my question, but do answered this ****.....    edit: no, don't worry!!!!!!!!!! lol i'm tired..... maybe i have bad humor today.....|`|WxfuhHwwaa	He sounds more like a Virgo to me.  I get along great with Sagis, but their unbridled optimism can get on my nerves if I'm in a grumpy mood.|`|126OP8mcaa	Only some are. You've met one who is the lower type. It's sad to say, but the truth hurts. Sagittarius sinks the lowest when it comes to disorganization, babbling and deceitfulness. A big part of it is that they are naive, especially about themselves.|`|K3U4tyEDaa	I don't find Sagittarians irritating.  The traits you list don't fit with the sign at all, aside from his foot in mouth disease like a few other answers have mentioned.  It sounds more like your friend has some confidence issues that he may be overcompensating for by dragging down others to build himself up.  So don't give up on Sags altogether, they make for really great friends, particularly with Scorpios. Romance can be a little tricky, but it's honestly a fantastic match for friendship.  Even with your Piscean influences.  If any sign is going to be right there with you on your dreamy Pisces wavelength, it's a Sag.  They might not completely understand where you're coming from, but they'll be enthralled nonetheless.|`|1bkiNiwzaa	If you are a Pisces or Virgo, the chances of you finding a Saggi irritating are Very High.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Sometimes I fear that I'm irritating. I like to talk and I often will say things right when I think of them.     I have a Pisces sun, Scorpio Moon friend and I KNOW she gets irritated by me. When we hang out, I do most of the talking. I feel like I'm too blunt for her.. I never say anything really mean to her.. I wouldn't do that, only if she made me super mad... but yeah.     I feel like you wouldn't like me.

No wonder your friend gets so annoyed with you. It sounds like everything that bothers you about your friend, you are exhibiting yourself.  It's called projection.  Look within before you start criticising and betraying your "friend."  A Sagittarius would not post such a damning question about a "friend."  They are more loyal than to stoop to such tactics.|`|72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	Wow! I'm a Sagittarius (December 18th) and I don't act anything like your friend. The one thing that you need to remember is that every Sagittarius is not the same, doesn't always have the same traits, personalities, etc.... I keep explaining to some people that were more than just our sun sign. It seems like I find myself saying this almost daily. You need to take into consideration someone's natal chart. We all have so many other signs in our planets that truly make up our unique personalities and traits. That's why some people can't figure out why they don't act like their sun sign or why a person doesn't have the characteristics of their sign. There is your answer right there! You have to look at the whole chart not just the sun sign. Like I said I'm a Sagittarius and I will say that I talk a lot, but I know how to control it and I know when and when not to run my mouth so much! I don't point out people's faults because that's not my place to do so. I do think before I do things but you really need to think for a second because I know people from so many other signs that never think before they do something so this has nothing to do with his sign. Yes, we Sagittarius are known for being blunt and have the foot in the mouth disease so we can sometimes speak before we think but we mean no harm and really have no idea we are even doing anything to upset the person. Don't be so hard on him about that! And, so what he's shy to new people, who isn't at times. If he's really such a pain to you then you need to stop hanging around him. Every sign has their negatives and that includes your sign as well. The one thing I learned is that all of us are a pain in the a** to someone at some point. I'm sure someone could say the same about you, you just don't know it or they have never mentioned it.|`|5l2kTANaaa	Oh well you got a bit of a handful alright ....not typically sag but who knows his ascendant , moon etc..could be in earth, water , strong Saturn etc..

Sure I KNOW (wink to above) that jealousy is deadly..but what can I do...am myself.........and that is it.

And not many people find me irratating, coz im pretty shy and I never say mean things about people.  My best friends get annoyed when I wont leave them alone though, I'm very hyper and always want to wrestle :P|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	some are very much so, if they are big into themselves.    others are not, if they are big into others    **Sag energy must be turned outward to be expressed in a positive way. When it is turned inward, it becomes restrictive and critical, of themselves and others. If Sag energy is restrained is seeks to break free and thrive.    A person does not have to have Virgo in the chart at all for the critical nature to be expressed. That behavior can come from many motivations. That Virgo is "criticizing" is a stereotype that is propagated by the general public, but has only a tertiary connection to real astrology.    The truth hurts, but it is what it is.  I would concur with what sleepless said also. I have very strong Pisces in my chart, and some Sags (not all, mind you) very much irritate me, when I bother to pay attention to them and the one i"m thinking of specifically has no Virgo in her chart. Mostly Leo and Gemini.|`|Vj43BqcDaa	It's not in the Sagittarian nature to be critical like you describe.  It sounds like he has a bit of Virgo in his chart.  Mixing Virgos analytical mind with the Sagittarian bluntness would indeed end up very annoying.  It's also not very Sag-like to be shy around new people.  It sounds like your friend has unfortunately been lumped with a few negative traits from the various influences in his birthchart.  Keep in mind he probably has no idea he annoys you this much.  I mean, he must have some redeemable qualities for you to remain friends, right? So, to answer your questions, it's in a Sag's nature to be extremely blunt (but they rarely expect to hurt someone's feelings and are usually shocked if they do), but it's not in their nature to be critical or shy (they're typically very friendly and love meeting new people).  Sags are predominantly very curious about people and love to know what makes them tick.  They also tend to focus on a person's positives rather than their flaws, which often makes them targets for people to take advantage.      By the way, I'm a Pisces and I happen to love Sagittarians.  So no, I don't find them irritating. =)    Edit:  The only reason I mentioned Virgo is because the question is asking about general natures.  Being critical is more of a Virgo trait, but Virgos also have many wonderful traits that more than make up for it.  If a Sagittarius has a lot of negative energy or insecurities expressed in their chart, they are far more likely to be critical and down on themselves.  Of course, this breeds discontent and bitterness which they may then take out on others, but it's rare to see a Sag like this as they are generally optimistic to the extreme.|`|iDfEBcgHaa	As a Sag myself (sun and rising) I just want to say I really hope we aren't all irritating by nature!  Your question made me laugh because I know exactly what you're talking about.  Every so often I don't get along with another Sag because they just seem to spew negativity about other people without a second thought. I think in general, being critical and self-conscious or timid aren't really traits associated with us, but speaking bluntly definitely is.  Audrey is right when she says we don't usually realize we've said something offensive.  I feel terrible when that happens.  It would be interesting to find out your friend's ascendant, mostly so I can blame another sign for his stupidity.  :D|`|SjD1aKT5aa	Woah! That's weird I was thinking of this exact question this morning..     Anyway, I don't this kind of thing can be to much to do with ones sign or chart. That's probably just how he grew up and is.. people change and so will he probably.     I'm a Scorpio myself but I absolutely love Sagittarians, my favourite sign besides my own.     :] Kiki|`|jNiCHwamaa	I'm a scorpio and i love saggitarius, actually me best friend is a saggitarian and we've been friends from way back. Actually at first we just couldn't understand each other cuz she used to say really hurtful things to me without even thinking and on the other hand she thought i was too modest and emotional. Its only later in life after our teenage years that we really accepted each other.    She's now more carefull about what she says to me but she's still brutally honest! One thing i like about saggies is that they tell you the honest truth, i trust her opinion no matter how brutal it is. If get a new hairstyle, she's the first one i go to cuz she'll tell me the truth and she doesn't do it to put down, its just the way she is.    She tells me all the time that i'm very beautiful and lovable and at the same time she reminds me all the time that my thighs are flabby and that i need to tone them down, if i do manage to tone them down, i know she'll be the first to compliment me.|`|f07fdb6bf714c125a917a88568499157aa	know all about sagittarius and its traits...    http://www.freeehoroscope.com/sagittariu...    and know about your horoscope 2009    http://www.freeehoroscope.com/horoscope-...

AA11784502	Hello ,  Watchmen has one of the best endings of any comic ever.   As a brief summary, Watchmen is written to be a more adult superhero story. If you don't love it, it may potentially bore you, I will tell you that.  The word "Watchmen" is simple another word for guard, or protector, which is what a superhero is. The word is never used in the book, except for the slogan "Who Watches the Watchmen?", which means Who makes sure the people protecting us are being responsible?  Watchmen takes place in a world where superheroes exist, but none have super powers. The one exception is Doctor Manhatten (the blue guy), who was a scientist who was in an accident which gave him god like abilities. Most of the superheroes are gone now, since the government banned them. The story begins with an old hero, a complete jerk named the Comedienne, being murdered. Another character named Rorshach (who's a bit insane) thinks that there's a conspiracy behind his death, and begins investigating, first by going around and talking to all the old heroes. The story takes off from there.  The importance of the story has to do with that it was written and is set in the 1980s.  From the 50s to the 80s, people all over the world were constantly afraid that the Soviet Union and the United States could start a nuclear war with each other at any moment and kill billions of people. This plays in majorly with the setting of the story.  Characters ;  1983, Charlton Comics, then on its last legs, sold its superhero characters to DC Comics. Shortly afterward, writer Alan Moore (Miracleman, Swamp Thing, V for Vendetta) approached DC executive editor Dick Giordano (former editor at Charlton, who had engineered the sale) with a proposal for a major story about the Charlton characters. Giordano liked the story, but hated the thought of applying Moore's ideas to characters he wanted to keep in usable condition.  Moore replaced the Charlton characters with analogs of his own invention. Charlton's Peacemaker became Moore's Comedian. The Question became Rorschach. The Blue Beetle and his 1940s counterpart became two characters named Nite Owl. Thunderbolt became Ozymandias. Captain Atom became Dr. Manhattan. Nightshade became Silk Spectre (tho Silk Spectre also took many characteristics from Phantom Lady). The first issue of the resulting 12-part limited series, Watchmen, was dated September, 1986. The artist was Dave Gibbons (Martha Washington, Give Me Liberty). The title was a reference to the old expression, "Who watches the watchman?" I.e., if superheroes are to protect us from villains, then who protects us from superheroes?  Watchmen was an attempt to bring such fantastic characters into the "real" world (whatever that is). It wasn't the first  a quarter-century earlier, a similar attempt had been made at Marvel Comics, with The X-Men squabbling among themselves, The Fantastic Four getting evicted from their headquarters because they couldn't pay the rent, Spider-Man having to dodge bullies at school, and things like that. Watchmen concentrated less on realistically imperfect personal lives, and more on a realistic geopolitical situation, realistic sexual feelings and activities, and a realistic impact on the world, from individuals who possessed superhuman abilities.  While most superheroes have been aimed at an adolescent reading level, and the 1960s Marvels became popular on college campuses, Watchmen was among the first superhero stories that required an adult's point of view for full appreciation. What The Maltese Falcon did for detective stories and Shane did for westerns, Watchmen did for superheroes. It transcended its origins in what was previously considered a lowbrow form of fiction to provide a rich reading experience for all, whether they came in as fans of the genre or not.  It also transcended series fiction in general by being a complete story in itself, with beginning, middle and end, and no prospect of the characters' adventures continuing afterward  as, indeed, they haven't. Watchmen has had no sequels, nor any talk of future sequels.  Significantly, Watchmen was the first (and thus far, only) comic book to win the prestigious Hugo Award for excellence in science fiction.  No sooner had the final chapter (October, 1987) hit the stands, than DC brought out a collected edition in both hardcover and trade paperback, as one of relatively few graphic novels that actually are novels in terms of length, complexity and unity of theme. There was also a reasonably popular role playing game. It was never merchandised the way many superheroes are merchandised.    =^,,^=|`|15b20bc2f63d778baab60d206ce6c1a4aa	read it

I just suggest casual wear and hair pins, coz i'd say that's as close to fighting wear as you'd get.|`|rNxK7cY8aa	Like the first two said, she doesn't have "fighting wear". The only thing that she really wears a lot is her school uniform and those hair pins.  : /    The closest thing she ever really gets to a fighting uniform is the shinigami outfit, and the uniform that Aizen gives to her after he captures her.  This was the best pic I could find of it on google.  http://www.augiewargo.com/thinwall%20cop...  http://img212.imageshack.us/img212/5687/...

ZEBsp37waa	Left side = Her in shinigami clothes  Right side = Her in the Espada uniform she was given to wear when taken by Ulquiorra.  Neither of them are her "uniform" really.  She has a t-shirt and jeans that are typically worn but now that the arc is about the Espada she just happens to wear the white one.|`|a919bfb9c4d207df3618510881d052d8aa	Not really uniforms, either of them. The left hand side shows her in Shinigami garb, whereas the right shows her in the clothes she gets when she's (SPOILER_)taken to Hueco Mundo(_SPOILER).|`|5OwJz5V4aa	she wore the shinigami outfit when they (she, ichigo, and the rest of the group) went to soul society to save rukia...    the other one, the white one, is the one she wore (wears - because she's still currently wearing them) while she's still in hueco mundo, kidnapped by aizen and the rest of his henchmen (including the arrancars, most especially the espadas)

tuATxHsVaa	K545 does NOT have the Rondo alla Turca. That is K331. Anyway, I think you have plenty of Mozart to practice here with K545 and there is no need to be learning a new sonata at this point (until you perfect the one you are doing).     *** *** ***    So if we were to put a grade on what you are doing, you are what, like grade 5 or 6 maybe?    I think it's time for you to pick up Chopin's Waltzes. Get the Dover edition with all the Waltzes because it's usually on the cheap.    Here are a bunch of free Chopin Waltzes from free scores:    http://www.free-scores.com/search-uk.php...    And for $12.95 you can buy the complete set of his Waltzes from Dover:    http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/a/item.htm...    You can also try his Mazurkas - they are Polish dances - and if you like the Waltzes you are sure to like them too.    Here are a bunch of free Mazurkas from Chopin (get the Dover edition again if you buy it - just scroll down the page and you should see it here):    http://www.free-scores.com/search-uk.php...    It would also be very good of you to learn Schubert's "Moments Musicaux" (Moment Musicals) - here is a free version:    http://www.free-scores.com/download-shee...    And now for a few pieces to listen to on YouTube:    Schnabel plays Moments Musicaux No. 1:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvdWPpXpn...    Barenboim plays Chopin's famous minute Waltz:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kfibWlWe...    And finally, a wonderful Mazurka played by Horowitz - Op. 33, No. 2 in D major:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LkXsnEEQ...    ---    After reviewing this question again, I think you need to listen to Tesla. Get the Children's Corner and learn "Golliwogs Cakewalk" or something.     Listen to Tesla he's got it about right. You can learn the Chopin later.    Here is Rachmaninoff (heard of him?) playing it:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvJ35-zZa...|`|Vh62DLxvaa	I believe the Mozart K545 3rd movement is the Rondo alla Turca. If so I would play it next. It sounds so awesome and it strengthened my hands so much. I used to have a lot of trouble with octaves...  After playing Rondo alla Turca my teacher compliments my octaves all the time    Sorry about that, Court Violinist is right. Rondo all Turca from K 331. I still highly recommend it. I also recommend Clementi's Sonatinas esp. No 6.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Granados Spanish Dance No. 5|`|p7UcyGYFaa	I'm concerned that the pieces you mention are all over the map in terms of difficulty. The little and big Bach G Major Minuets are very simple, the Mozart Sonata is his easiest, the Sinfonias are more challenging but intermidiate...and the Chopin is  way beyond anything you should be attempting at this point, given the other pieces you mention.      Usually, what would come next for someone at your likely level are some of the easier Chopin Preludes, the Bach Partitas or French Suites, Debussy's Childrens' Corner Suite or some of his Book I Preludes, maybe a few Haydn Sonatas (famous D Major comes to mind.) The Chopin Etudes are a wonderful goal, but you might be setting yourself up for real disappointment. You'll get there, but it will be easier if you work up to it a bit more gradually, I think.|`|zg0Iricdaa	Well I can tell from your post you have ALOT to learn and you should stay far away from Chopin's Revolutionary Etude (or any of them really) and Hungarian Dance no.5.    -Its good that you pursued a teacher but you seem to have completely disregarded your teachers advice since all you remember are the complements she gave you.  I always take the negative things she says about my playing more to heart than the compliments.    -You said you have bad fingering. If you have bad fingering technique there is no way you'll be able to play Revolutionary etude.  Mozart is excellent for developing good technique and sonata 545 is harder than it appears.     -You say you don't know about the quality of your dynamics?  This is one of the major things your teacher will be covering with you (at least it is with my teacher) But if you advance to more difficult pieces without being able to play the simple ones with proper dynamics, phrasing, and voicing you will never accomplish anything.   Also, don't think that just because Bach's instruments didn't have    the dynamic qualities of today's you should just play Bach monotone.    -It's good to be ambitious, but not too ambitious (which you seem to be).  You seemed to be more concerned with the ability to be able to play virtuously and not on the ability to interpret music and put feeling into it.    -So what pieces should you play:  I suggest you ask your teacher first of all, and actually LISTEN to what she suggests.  Go back to the pieces you have learned (k545, fur elise, clair de lune NOT Revolutionary or Hungarian dance) and break out the sheet music (even though you already memorized them) and go through them again and pay attention the phrase and dynamic markings.    Now I have a hunch that your the type of person who only will hear what he wants to hear so you probably won't listen to my advice which is you pull back and with hold from the more advance pieces.  Piano is so much more than just being able to play fast, everyone started out simple and you are no different.

2VNmxfgpaa	Well you shouldn't intervene with fate.  That never is a good idea.    As a Libra with Aquarian mate, I'll tell you the secrets.  Fashionable and attractive is important to them.  Femininity.  You're a Libra girlfriend, you can do that one.  Flirty with other guys is a total turn-off.  Stay away from that like the plague.  Play into a mutual interest, make sure to aim your charm at him only, in private only whenever possible.    Actually the match is supposed to be one of the best for both signs.  John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Kelly Preston and John Travolta, all Libra Aquarius matches.    They like that Libra can throw a great party, good cook, decorator, all that...they like the Libra social skills, the artistic skills, ability to perform.  They like the way you think, but don't talk toooooo much.  LOL     They like to make up their own mind.

a919bfb9c4d207df3618510881d052d8aa	The Bleach filler starts at the end of the Soul Society arc, around ep.68-69 and goes on till about 110. That arc is called the 'Bount arc' and wasn't as bad as it could've been (though you might like to skip it anyway) compared to Naruto fillers. Naruto has some filler episodes fit in along plot-advancing ones (Bleach has some too, but fewer) but those are bearable. The one's that start at 138 or so of the original series and go on till the end however are not.    In Naruto Shippuden you'll run into a filler arc right after the 'meeting Sasuke' storyline ends and you can skip that (something about a kid with collected kyuubi chakra) safely. However the latest filler is a bit tricky, seeing as it weaves in and out of the actual plotline from the manga- so you should still see that.  In Bleach you'll run into a few fillers after the Arrancar arc starts around ep110, but these are easily recognisable and sporadically spread out without becoming their own full-length arcs. So you may as well bear with those. There's another bout of fillers starting at ep.168 all the way along to about ep.190 or so. This can be skipped. A continuation of this same arc again starts at ep.204 which may also be skipped.    Death Note and Full Metal Alchemist are devoid of fillers. In the latter case the story diverges from the manga to such a degree that there's no point in having fillers and the former, while it has its own take on things once in a while is mostly faithful to the storyline.  I'm not familiar with One Piece because the manga didn't really do it for me though.    You should also definitely try Monster, Jigoku Shoujo, Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori, YuYu Hakusho, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (and the sequel R2), etc. Great shows, not always in the mainstream, but brilliant none the less!|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	naruto's easy, anything after like ep 123 or whatever, when sasuke fights naruto at the top of a water fall, everthing after that is filler, then it start being cannon in naruto shipuuden. Bleach's Bount (Bounto) arc is a filler arc, and all the other filler arcs are pretty obvious. as for one piece i don't know, and honest don't care, even the filler arcs for one piece are epically awesome. lol.|`|ZEBsp37waa	Naruto is basically filled with fillers that are scattered all over the place  Honestly a waste of time, better off with the manga.  Bleach has the Bounto arc (64-109) and that one with the little girl more recently(168-189).  Death note has no fillers as its a short anime (from memory).  Full metal alchemist sort of does, theres a pointless episode here and there like the thief psiren early in the series, but the manga for full metal alchemist isnt even finished yet, so the anime wasnt really on par.  But i do believe a new fma anime will be out in april.    Also, try to broaden your range rather than those typical animes.  Theres a lot out there that arent as stereotypical and much better.  I've given up on naruto, one piece and bleach for their simple repetitiveness (especially bleach).

2UDbOpxTaa	Firstly, don't panic. I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing for you, but to be honest not that many people will be concentrating on you, and no one will be evaluating or remembering your performance.  Secondly, don't get caught up on the technical side of things. There's nothing more annoying than a guitarist who's contantly going on about their levels or effects or feedback - no one else cares or can hear. Just go on, do your thing, and even if it doesn't sound perfect to you, just play along with a smile.  Thirdly, keep playing, whatever happens. I've seen so many guitarists stop playing because their amps cut out, they play something wrong, they think they're slightly out of tune, or whatever. They look like morons. As I said before, no one cares, and even if no sound is coming out of your amp, it looks better if you just keep playing. The only reason you should stop is if you're majorly out of tune and it sounds excruciating.  Lastly, just smile and be confident and easy-going. You say you're playing in a church band - so play in the hope that you'll help people worship, for God's glory, not your own. Hope it goes well.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	relax , try to have fun, keep playing even if you screw up , they wont notice unless you make it obvious

Libra can help! The two of you could not be more different. Virgos like work so much that they will give up play for it, but Libras will be resourceful about finding shortcuts at work so they can get out and play more often. To be fair, Libras network professionally while socializing -- something your lover could teach you a thing or two about. You tend to be a bit reclusive, so Libra's influence will be a breath of fresh air.     Both of you are analytical and brainy but not deeply emotional. Hopefully, you will both think up ways to keep the embers of your passion aglow. In bed, allow your Libra lover to be playful and relax you after your long day's work. They are wizards at setting the scene of romance -- the low lights, soft music, seductive gestures -- even years after you've met. Don't criticize Libra's efforts or the shape of his or her body (not everyone looks like Nicole Kidman). Be open and accepting and I guarantee your passion for one another will only grow over time. Libras are ruled by the erotic planet Venus, so how can you go wrong?     Libra is the sign of marriage, and your nature is to be giving. Since you are a mutable sign, you are flexible and open -- this bodes well for the overall health of your relationship. Libra is a cardinal sign, so you can count on your lover to push against the limitations of life, and to explore new experiences and frontiers. Cardinal signs ensure things are never dull. Libras are lively and talkative, so you can count on plenty of sparkling conversations.     You will love Libra's elegant ways and your lover will always be fun to hang out with. Air signs have more friends than anyone else, so you are sure to meet some very interesting people. Your lover has sensational taste, and Virgo is no slouch either. Your attractiveness as a stylish twosome will be a source of pride for you both. Virgo's clothing is always smart, fashionable, polished, and clean -- after all, your sign rules detail and the search for perfection. Libras, being ruled by Venus, put a great deal of emphasis on making themselves attractive and keeping up their natural good looks. As a Virgo you are careful about being healthy and fit, and you can influence your partner to take care of his or her body in ways that go beyond just cosmetics and clothes.     All in all, although you're not a classic pairing, you do have many gifts to share with one another if you open your hearts with love.|`|RV2R8Vkaaa	sick of this stupid &*%$ "****"  you all tell me im just like you  and even though i know its true  i hate myself so do i hate you?    why can't i be different  why must i be the same  born with blood  and born with pain    once i was told to be great  once i was told i was great  once i was told its just fate  once i told fate just to wait    wait for me to see  see i am me  see that i can be  see that i can be free    sick of this stupid &*%$ "****"  you all tell me im just like you  and even though i know its true  i hate myself so do i hate you?    why can't i be the same  why not accept my shame  bleed my blood  and forget the pain    see that i am free  see if you can see  see what is me  wait for anyone but me    once i was told to be great  once i was told i was great  once i was told its just fate  once i told fate just to wait|`|t6wmRfoZaa	I'll call my psychic friends to get an answer.  sorry on here, that's the best you're gonna do.

FBwK9s7Baa	Gemini can complement the wisdom and experience of Capricorn provided both are willing to communicate. Sometimes both have to agree or disagree. Capricorn is steady and controlled and Gemini is fond of change. Capricorn does not always understand the highly strong, quicksilver ways of Gemini. Although very different, each can enrich the other with gifts etc .Oddly enough, this is a relationship that can work for the wrong reason. Capricorns can be real workaholics. As far as the Gemini is concerned, it gives them a license to leap about town having a terrific time and no questions asked .         Neither of them will know what the other one is doing, so they could both be ferociously unfaithful, flirting and philandering all over the place and neither will be any the wiser.The goats are gorgeous, in a way. The restraining rings of their ruler, superb Saturn, make them cautious, careful and considering. Some of them can also be incredible conservative, with more than just a hint of being old-fashioned. Geminis, on the other hand, are usually one step ahead of everyone else, always seeking out something new, changing their mercurial minds at the toss of a coin and scampering from stone to stone along life's highway.   Airy Gemini and fiery Sagittarius will maintain an interest on a mental or intellectual level. Sagittarius has a sense of independence, great love for freedom, restrictions on that are not tolerable. Both signs are opposite. Gemini and Sagittarius are not demonstrative, have an immense touch of love, quick wit, are generous and cheerful. Gemini lacks in concentration and quick decision which Sagittarius has. Both are fashionable, fond of society and has no chance of separation.These two are at opposite ends of the celestial sky, so have everything to offer each other and are a very complementary combination.         It's said that the sign opposite you contains everything you lust for and lack and that's certainly true of this pair. Geminis belong to the sign of the lower mind, perfect for dealing with communications on a day-to-day basis. With Sagittarians, though, their brains have been broadened into a deeper and more profound path, towards philosophy and similar subjects. These Archers can think far beyond the realms of the Gemini and that's the clue to the success of this couple. Sagittarius can make those glib Geminians sit up and take notice.The twins are so used to ruling the roost intellectually, and yet they would be delighted to discover a Sagittarius who knows more than they do.Once these two have met, they'll set off on a voyage of mental discovery together. Even if they're merely mates, this will be a marriage of minds.|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	Yes. Just like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.

6rR7LTl1aa	Clannad was awesome.  So many crack-up moments...I had to stifle laughter a few times just to keep watching, as the male lead often puts on long and involved practical jokes.    Touching at times, like any of the other KyoAni releases (Kannon, Air) as of late.    I'm currently watching Ouran HHC and liking it -- Clannad manages to insert both more hilarity and more heavy themes into its runtime than what I've seen so far in Ouran.

WVXVeN8Gaa	Well, college requires (regardless of your major) that you take core curriculum courses. If your knowledge (or possibly interests) are that narrow, then I'd recommend that you enroll in a trade school, although I'm not sure you'll receive the credentials you are seeking.    As for "how to become a musical composer," music theory is the root of all musical epistemology. Although you sound like every other college student I've ever come across, good luck with whatever you seek to accomplish.|`|VeYbalAjaa	I hate to tell anyone to drop out, but that may be your best option. If you don't go to a school geared only towards music, then you are going to have to take the other BS. But, if you want to be a professionally trained composer, a proper university may be where you really need to be. If you can find a school aimed at teaching you music and that can get you where you want to go, then I would say go for it. Don't live life with any regrets.

OTj8vfQzaa	Monica and Chandler went to an adoption agency and got selected by a girl named Erica to adopt her baby, but when she gave birth they were surprised to find out that it was twins-a boy and a girl. They decided to keep both babies and named them Jack and Erica.  Ross and Rachel stayed together, but as of the last episode they were not married. They just declared their love and apparently lived happily ever after with their daughter.|`|25d466c75995ead18acb403dca51e574aa	Erica gives birth to twins, Monica and Chandler were there for the birth. Rachel and Ross do not get married, and the season finale has Rachel going to Paris, and Ross and Phoebe racing to get to the airport before she leaves, accidentally going to JFK, when she is leaving from Newark. They finally get to the airport, and Ross tells Rachel he loves her, she gets on the plane. Ross gets home, checks his answering machine, listens to a message from Rachel saying she loves him too, and is getting of the plane. He turns around to see Rachel standing in the door way. To answer the question about Rachel and Ross's baby, who's named Emma, Rachel raises her with everyone's help, and even dates Joey for a while.|`|pytpNUieaa	Monica and Chandler find out at the end of season 9 that they can't have kids.

wiAWIMMqaa	Based on the memoir of Philadelphia Inquirer columnist John Grogan's life with his yellow Labrador retriever. The story is a collection of anecdotes about Marley running wild in Grogan's home and looks at the dog's 13-year life (he died two years ago).    Unsure of his preparedness for raising children, John confesses his fears to his friend and fellow journalist Sebastian, who comes up with the perfect solution: John should get Jenny a puppy. "There's nothing to it," says Sebastian. "You walk 'em. You feed 'em, you let 'em out now and then." A few months after they are married they go to a dog breeder who lives on a farm and Jenny picks out a puppy (A.K.A Clearance Puppy) which John later names Marley while listening to Bob Marley in his car. Marley cost them $200    Jenny is a feature writer who becomes a stay-at-home mom. John reporter who gets refashioned, by his testy editor (Alan Arkin), into a lifestyle columnist (only to keep complaining about it  poor guy!).     Soon after their wedding, John and Jenny Grogan escape the brutal Michigan winters and relocate to a cottage in southern Florida, where they are hired as reporters for competing newspapers. At The Palm Beach Post, Jenny immediately receives prominent front-page assignments, while at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, John finds himself writing obituaries and two-paragraph articles about mundane news like a fire at the local garbage dump.    When John senses Jenny is contemplating motherhood, his friend and co-worker Sebastian Tunney suggests the couple adopt a dog to see if they're ready to raise a family. From a litter of newborn yellow labrador retrievers they select Marley (named after reggae singer Bob Marley), who immediately proves to be incorrigible. They bring him to Ms. Kornblut, who firmly believes any dog can be trained, but when Marley refuses to obey commands, she expels him from her class.    Editor Arnie Klein offers John a twice-weekly column in which he can discuss the fun and foibles of everyday living. At first stumped for material, John realizes the misadventures of Marley might be the perfect topic for his first piece. Arnie agrees, and John settles into his new position.    Marley continues to wreak havoc on the household, providing John with a wealth of material for his column, which becomes a hit with readers and helps increase the newspaper's circulation. Jenny becomes pregnant, but loses the baby early in her first trimester. She and John travel to Ireland for a belated honeymoon, leaving the rambunctious dog in the care of a young woman who finds him impossible to control, especially during the frequent thunderstorms that plague the area. Soon after returning from their vacation, Jenny discovers she is pregnant again, and this time she delivers a healthy boy, Patrick. When she has a second son, Connor, she opts to give up her job and become a stay-at-home mom, and the couple decides to move to a larger house in the safer neighborhood of Boca Raton, where Marley delights in swimming in the backyard pool.    John and Jenny welcome a daughter, Colleen, to their family. Although she denies she is experiencing postpartum depression, Jenny exhibits all the symptoms, including a growing impatience with Marley and John, who asks Sebastian to care for the dog when Jenny insists they give him away. She quickly comes to realize he has become an indispensable part of the family and agrees he can stay.John celebrates his 40th birthday. Increasingly disenchanted with his job, he decides to accept a position as a reporter with The Philadelphia Inquirer with Jenny's blessing, and the family moves to a farm in rural Pennsylvania.|`|ZaYJG8fwaa	It's about a couple getting a dog instead of having kids.  They got Marley right after they got married.  Their jobs were newspaper reporters, er somethin'.|`|hJterUnKaa	*Spoiler*  Marley and Me is about a young couple just starting their lives together and the husband, John Groger (a columnist for a newspaper), decides to surprise his wife Jenny (writes for a different newspaper), with a puppy. They go to a dog breeder and she picks out a puppy (A.K.A Clearance Puppy) which he later names Marley while listening to Bob Marley in his car.  As their lives progress, they have 3 kids and  go through many challenges. At the end Marley becomes so ill he has to be euthanized.|`|tLerk7OSaa	1. It's about these couples, Jenny and John grogan who got married and got a troublemaking dog Marley.   2.They got marley at a farm for 200 bucks a few months after they married  3. John and Jenny both work for a newspaper thing.|`|HcmylEwXaa	The story is about more than them buying a dog, it is about their life and how Marley affected it. They got Marley after they moved to Florida and got their jobs. Jenny got a job as a reporter on one local paper, but then became a stay at home mom and John started off as a reporter on another local paper, but then became a columnist. I can't remember the name of the papers they worked for|`|NPFuyuKiaa	what she said, but in a much cooler way lol, nah she deserves the points|`|GykCnbR7aa	dont buy it it was absolutely and it is not target at children and teens its targeted at adults i was in the theater for like half an hour and got up and left cause it was starting to get sexual really bad

Also watch the things you ask/talk about.|`|cuIX13BKaa	That 'Pain in the neck' comment is abusive. You aren't it is a way of controling you or trying to control you. Too many women take that kind of comment and let it try to float away......please never stand for anyone saying something like this....I can tell by your prior questions that you are the one wondering if you are good enough, and you are, or smart enough and you are or any number of things......and you are that wonderful. This is a so called game played between people in the bantering of language....is going on all over the world. I had a former flame who would mimic his parents and call me a Nitwit....I didnt like it then and I do not like it now...I was raised to be kind. He is 30 years older and still using the word...but not on me. It was a catch phrase of his family's. It was a disparaging remark that they all used....you are beign called a Pain in the Neck and you have Nothing to prove to this person.......if it is THAT important to you ask him firmly....and do NOT let him weasel out of it......what exactly makes you that pain in the neck. I have no idea how old you are, but i have not one time seen you be unkind on this site which is the only place i know you from. Make him tell you in what way, when, where and how you EVER became that thing he is calling you...then I highly recommend that you take some breathing time and leave him alone to think about it....do not put lead weights on your feet to swim.....and accepting words like this is peril emotionally. I wish youthe best.    Garbo|`|14gi4aTvaa	He obviously likes you, but wishes you would stop being a pain in the neck.

Oq1qwLBoaa	SHE LOOKS SO PRETTY! [Not in the picture, but after the surgery!]    No offence to anyone, but with a nose like that; you really do need to do something about it. It's seriously ridiculous.    I'm getting a Nose Job when I turn 17. Right now it looks like this:    http://www.hollywood-celebrity-pictures....    And it's hopefully going to look something like:    http://www.beattrend.com/wp-content/uplo...    http://earthfirst.com/wp-content/uploads...    http://991.com/NewGallery/Kylie-Minogue-...    Love,  Bridgitte    x0x0|`|IHa6FxE6aa	Michael Jackson's twin sister.|`|vZqYUZk1aa	it doesnt load so i dont even know if she really got a nose job?     and He is holy, pure to die for our sins.  Christ/means the Messiah the anointed one  as in the movie 'The Passion of the Christ"  i didnt even know she got a nose job...but i know her sister picked up some weight. (and she is saying it dont matter, yet she wont be happy with her nose???come on now!)  about her sister's weight....  which old women on tv say too bad   but they dont understand alot of guys, wouldnt be too interested i guess in her, let alone these 30-40 year old foot in thier mouth women critisizing guys who want the super model type, and in shape too.    and if she got a nose job fine, as long as no boogers are showing lol    and my team won at baskeball tonight but we lost to the lakers last night  some of them guys maybe need a nose job..but its up to their wives!    David laughing and i didnt see the picture, in Jesus amazing grace  and thanks|`|MyVtwtOnaa	its whatever|`|ED5jRupoaa	I think it's both horrible and hypocritical. She's out there complaining that everyone's picking on Jessica for her weight gain and saying it shouldn't matter what you look like and yet she hacked off the majority of her own nose. I think she looks terrible with that caved in nose bridge and it looks like a really bad nose job. Personally, I thought her original nose made her look better and not like a clone of all the other young blonde singer chicks. That's Hollywood for ya'.|`|uly3aFqtaa	HAHAHAHA  I looked :)    That was pretty funny cause I was expecting to see a serious photo!    Her REAL Nose Job? I think they did an excellent job; it looks very natural and has completely changed her face.  I do think that she looked pretty before, and she shouldn't rely on surgery to change her.    Xx.    P.S. Is that Bridgitte girl SERIOUS?!

Aren't you the guy-from the Village People band?  4. Hey, you must have been doing 125 to keep up with me. Good job.  5. I though you had to be in relatively good physical shape to be a police officer.  6. I was going to be a cop, but I decided to finish high school instead.  7. Bad cop, no donut.  8. You're not going to check the trunk are you?  9. Gee, that gut sure doesn't inspire confidence.  10. Didn't I see you get your butt kicked on COPS?  11. Wow, you look just like the guy in the picture on my girlfriends night stand.  12. Is it true that people become cops because they're too dumb to work at McDonalds?  13. I pay your salary.  14. So uh, you on the take or what?  15. Gee officer, that's terrific. The last officer only gave me a warning.  16. Do you know why you pulled me over? Okay, just so one of us knows.  17. I was trying to keep up with traffic. Yes, I know there are no other cars around, that's how far ahead they are.  18. What do you mean, "Have I been drinking?" YOU'RE the trained specialist.  19. Well officer, when I reached down to pick up my bag of crack, my gun fell off of my lap and got lodged between the brake and the gas pedal, forcing me to speed out of control.  20. Hey, is that a 9mm? That's nothing compared to this 44 magnum.  21. Hey, can you give me another one of those full cavity searches?  22. No, YOU assume the position.  23. I'm surprised you stopped me, Dunkin Donuts is having a 3 for 1 special!  24. If I bend over, will I still get a ticket?  25. No, offi, offic, lucifer...I'm not as think you are drunk I am. I swear to dog.  26. No, I don't know how fast I was going. The little needle stops at 110mph.  27. Back off Barney, I've got a piece.  28. But officer, I've got 2 different drivers licenses from 2 different states! Pick ONE!  29. I know I was weaving, but I was trying to hit all the little green men!  30. On the way to the station, let's get a six pack, oh and don't forget the cigs.  31. Come on, write the stupid ticket, the bars close in 20 minutes!  32. Hey, wasn't your daughter a porn queen?  33.

Sorry officer, I didn't realize my radar detector wasn't plugged in.    18. Aren't you the guy from the villiage people?    17. Hey, you must have been doing 125 to keep up with me, good job.    16. I thought you had to be in relatively good physical shape to be a police officer.    15. I was going to be a cop, but I decided to finish high school instead.    14. Bad cop. No donut.    13. You're not going to check the trunk, are you?    12. Gee, that gut sure doesn't inspire confidence.    11. Didn't I see you get your butt kicked on cops?    10. Is it true that people become cops because they are too dumb to work at McDonalds?    9. I pay your salary    8. So uh, you on the take or what?    7. Gee officer, that's terrific.

AA11518803	I think it's pretty much common knowledge that the earth was warmer 60 million years ago than it is today- only the dumbest scientist or environmentalist wouldn't know that fact.

I always tell myself to broaden my horizons because amazing music is everywhere if you take the time to look for them and listen to them :)     so yes music is a big big BIG part of my life :)    p.s.

Are we as dumb as Nigeria?"    * To the 7-year old African-American author of a controversial poem: "You want to go to Africa? I will personally purchase your airfare."    * On immigration protests: Mexico "is a country that has been overtaken by lawbreakers from the bottom to the top. And now, what you're protesting for is to have lawbreakers come here."    * Responding to criticism of his remarks on immigration protests: "[I] pretty much stand by" the assertion that "Mexico is run by nothing but criminals."    * On American Indians in South Dakota considering skirting a state ban on abortion: They "will have found something that can be more profitable than casinos, and that's abortion clinics."    * Suggesting "politically correct" names for bunker-buster nuclear weapons: "[B]utterfly bomb," "climate-control device," "[b]omb de tropical. ... We could use that one in Venezuela."    * On immigrants entering illegally from Mexico: Either "they're terrorists," "they're escaping the law," or "[t]hey can't make a living in their own dirtbag country."

I might buy some valentines cards for my kids to give out in school but I know nobody worth giving one to.|`|9xgGd9praa	Yes, because love should be shown every day, not just on one day because consumerism said so.|`|EZdRYJXraa	The same for me too, how bad that we are not going to get flowers and chocolates and whatever else.|`|f31f908014d2b0af62a2fd89a09a8d16aa	Yeah :/  I used to hate it in junior high, stupid 12 year olds feeling so important that they got a rose or a heart balloon and showing it off.|`|rzZXJz0qaa	Same here! =) I can send you a valentine!|`|oWFsc0cCaa	No No No!|`|FMJ9H0rjaa	yep  same same|`|ukRpBJ6Daa	yeah.    lol. same same.    :D    Xoxo|`|ONe2lanlaa	no! im not single this year :)  but even when i am i always get my friends little gifts i make them little gift sets and cookies. and Lil im 18 and my mom still gives me little gifts each v day  you just let people no you love them you dont have to have it be sexual|`|IWU0lbDXaa	been for the past 22 years|`|Qc2VO9G9aa	Yes, it is just another day.  I do what i always do, no big deal to me.|`|A6bUHdyTaa	It's not just another day.  It never has been.  It's never really been about couples or dating.  When I was younger, my parents made sure that it was a day about love -- any kind of love.  Love for friends, love for family, or love in the romantic sense.  I got cards from mom and dad, and as an adult, I actually still get them.  Each V-day, my dad buys me flowers.  He's been doing it ever since I can remember.  I think I was 4 or so when I got them the first time.  For all I know, they could have been there before that point.  I don't know.  I don't live with them anymore, and he still sends them to me even though I'm in a different state than he is.  He's my dad.  He has such an unconditional love for me.  My mom does as well.  That is just a day where they want to remind me of it in special ways.|`|ciMjM2Wvaa	Awww, you know you can count on a bite from me.

I would rather she swing at me than her child. Calling the police on a stranger would be next. If it were a friend I would seriously let her know she needed help and if she didn't get it I would report her to child services.|`|XENd8mNhaa	My answer is grab the baby duck,tuck and roll out of harms way.|`|2MlJ5OdYaa	I would grab the child away from her, and keep her from laying another hand on her/him until help for the child comes.|`|JU26EGAeaa	I would start beating the mother with my FRIEND.|`|L0ft1eo7aa	not my problem so nothing|`|DD1dHc61aa	Turn her in a be like WTF ARE YOU DOING? and stop her|`|AA12036375	I would stop her and if she still wanted to beat on someone then she could try with me, someone her own size ! I wouldn't care if it was a friend or not.|`|bbWzitisaa	i don't care who it is, i would make a big deal about it. that does not teach the child anything, only makes them feel fear, and they will only hide things later on in life. i would so get onto that woman, and probably end up calling social services, as i would see her as an unfit mother. even if she is a friend, there is no reason to beat a child.|`|fOr37xtfaa	i would go up and be like WHAT THE F**K ARE YOU DOING!!!... and tell her to stop and ill probably call the cops.. if it was a guy though i'd beat the crap out of him.|`|2MeJDnoeaa	I say That I'd never hit a woman... But, once she hits a child she is no longer a 'woman' she is now just a piece of sh*t...    I think I'd lose my mind and probably smash her nose out the back side of her head... (friend or not)|`|ac79c1bc2006138a997b16c6ea9ba908aa	if she's ma frnd i go and tell her that she better stop it !,and if she don't i do beat her lol nah   " take ur hands offf the lil child he'll do the same thin for his kids then!!"|`|y1TDricRaa	i'd ask them WTF is there problem? and pull the kid away|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Maybe call the police!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I would rip the sick b*tch off the child, and run away. I would take the child to the hospital immediately and have her arrested. Later, I would find out where she lives and beat the living snot right out of her. Only cowards beat children.|`|ij9N9r5waa	Friend or not I would physically stop her then call CPS.  she don't deserve kids.|`|A49Oqjvwaa	i'd stop her|`|rpAefo2kaa	I would pull the child away from the mother and probably pimp slap the biotch. Then I would hide away with the child till she cooled off and then I would just have to beat the crap out of her.|`|juraRlbkaa	I'd stop her duh. I can't stand it when kids are being abused.

Not funny! (hehe)|`|bajnzy4maa	Well usually I don't tell the person how I'm going to get revenge on them but sense you're a special friend here's my plan: First I'll subscribe to adult magazines and send them to your address in your name. Then I'll ex lax your food and order 10 tons of gravel to be shipped to your house.I'll also hide behind your bushes and throw water balloons at you every time you walk by, and probably buy a monkey that chucks poop. If none of this pleases me then I'll hire a hit man. If that doesn't work then inside my heart I'll throw as much love and compassion at you as I can and make you feel terrible about whatever it is you did to wrong me... which is what?|`|fdP9UJOsaa	... ah damn-it i'm tired, I give up|`|a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	*Nope !!! still debating in my mind !!~?|`|re06t6zvaa	yup. im not gonna answer your questions for a while..this is my last one :)|`|5rraSJRVaa	Why should I?

PvwZdLuLaa	Rich! No financial worries. I'm sure this is what most people would choose.|`|bcb934cd4176c6117c3cbd9a6a0357c9aa	I don't mind to be poor as long I'm rich inside.|`|AA11230418	Neither|`|MMmv06Ynaa	rich ovbiously, who would want to suffer. if you are rich, then you can spread some money to the poor too.|`|R0KEbgJGaa	People who want to be rich: You, normal typical ordinary citizens, government, maybe you.  People who want to be poor: Jesus? People who want to know how's it like to be poor etc etc, maybe you.|`|QADhk0nFaa	rich|`|65009ccaf72ccd7729436ef7347a8b0daa	rich for God(love, spirit, wisdom)|`|Cie6smHaaa	rich|`|GAxhD5yZaa	I'd rather be poor.|`|7zifiisiaa	Rich and happy with the way that I got there|`|bM9Y79wHaa	Rich lifestyle is better (and more fat)|`|fOr37xtfaa	rich|`|0LBNKveLaa	fu.cking rich|`|3omToSXnaa	rich|`|AA10334348	poor    if I were rich, there's a high chance I'd become corrupt like everyone else.|`|5V3K7a8qaa	Wow, tough question...|`|hWvWXzPvaa	rich|`|gwEubXRjaa	neither rich nor poor...|`|R0g2otNhaa	Richer than poor.|`|owt1GjyIaa	Poor.  Walk the streets of any city and you'll realize that the poorest of beggars are by far happier than the wealthiest of business executives.|`|mJPYhoDQaa	Once one of my mom's rich friends said "Money does buy happiness but,  it sure makes thing easier."And I couldn't agree more!|`|AA12116854	I can only tell you what I read someone said in some book: "(Both)...are good for some things, bad for others."    I'd rather be poor. That way you still have your dreams, no guilt over how you got the money or what you're doing with it, and no constant worry over who might take your money from you.   There's a reason Jesus said that it is "...easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter heaven." The above are three main reasons.|`|HmcqNvhEaa	It depends on the context. If one is talking about money, then obviously it would be easier and nicer to be rich. But if one changes it to something else, you could have all the money in the world, but no-one to share it with, no laughter, no love etc. If you are poor, but have loads of friends and loved ones to share your life with, then you are truly rich (if that makes sense). I would rather the latter (poor, but rich with friends etc)|`|I2dzLiCvaa	rich|`|RzpH0Oo8aa	Not too rich but not too poor.

RNWSAItbaa	Emo means emotional, okay!    Stop picking on people, some people actually do want to die, and one of my best friends is wanting to committ suicide, and has actually tried.     People who think like this, are people that have 'Depression' it's a disease, as much as Cancer is one and everything else. So what's the difference there!    Those people are sick and need help! you don't know what they have to go through.    So I suggest you shut the f'uck up, and stop hating on those people.     I admitt, I do hate people, who are EMO for no reason, and who are just posers but there are some people in this world that have been sexually abused, or physically or suffered child abuse or something else emotional and have lost all hope.    So I suggest you shut the f'uck up and go and hate some other thing    Emo's are not a sterotype, they desevre to be loved, just as much as anybody else.     So, get over it mate. It's people like you and all the people who "dis" them that make them that way, if you would just learn to love somebody and not tease them, then this world would be a much better place.    **    Look Anne, F'uckin settle down, and for you to say that depression isn't a disease, then obviously you need to know your f'uckin facts before you start telling me to learn mine! Depression is diagnosed by a what! A Psychologist! and what is that Anne!? A DOCTOR! and what do DOCTORS do Anne!! Hmm.. I don't know... Diagnose Diseases!!! God..    Depression is a mental disorder, which is a disease! and why of course would you have medication for something that is not a disease!!     If you would know what I go through and all the things I have to face every single f'ucking day! like watching my FATHER try and KILL my MOTHER because he has been cheating on her, how would you feel calling the police nearly twice a week!! So f'uck off Anne! and if you read my answer CORRECTLY you would of heard how I stated that I hate people who are EMO posers! and that just do it for attention.    I care about the people who have to go through, abuse after abuse, like those little kids who get beaten by their parents, or sexually abused. If you can put cancer before that, heck it's a disease alright, but you don't get that emotional scarring aswell as physical! how would you feel if your father raped you every day, I bet you wouldn't go on mocking depression.    Live in somebody else's shoes, before you start your FACTLESS answer and abusing my answer, So go get a life Anne!|`|oDMEYSKjaa	I cut myself because i need to feel pain...boohoo  i wish i was never born  I need to die   no one cares about me, so i just go away, no one would notice anyway..blah blah blah|`|kJ8RCRGGaa	Look Michelle, Emo or Emotional..whatever! People commit suicide, yes. BUT you obviously don't know your facts. Emo's PROUDLY SAY IM GOING TO COMMIT SUICIDE! Like, Oh, I may not be here tomorow so have a good life...I have a friend that's very Emo. She f*cking says that all the time. They need to f*cking wake up and people like you give them the satisfaction they want. Oh some people want to die, they have depression..and another thing, DEPRESSION IS NOT A DISEASE...and how dare you compare it to cancer...completely two f*cking things there missy! LEARN YOUR FACTS!   Emo's, yes some, need help, but most of them are starving for attention! They are not sick at all. I know so many people who cut themselves over the stupidest things, and don't hide their markings...they proudly show other people because its cool. They deserved to be loved? A lot of them do have love, but they f*cking ignore it. They always find excuses on why there lieing, when there not, and they do the opposite.   Its people like YOU that need to shut the f*ck up and get a life and open your damn eyes and realize they are doing it for attention.|`|MmbLWe3Qaa	lol lol lol lol      Man, that's annoying.     Anyways, "I wish my grass were emo so it would cut itself." I don't think that's the point you're making, but it's still annoying.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	If life is so beautiful,  why does roses have thorns?|`|0LBNKveLaa	"i want 2 dyeeeeeeeee"|`|95d9fb9f67e7bf13ceaf588f2f98d5d8aa	well...IIIIII dont see why people think like that  =/  its like the cant squeeze into their heads that somebody loves them|`|5V3K7a8qaa	Why is emo becoming so popular?     There is such thing as being clinically "emo" and they sure as hell don't dress up to show it off.
Cb6aKYuWaa	Yes, I will rather offer him half the amount to keep it light but real.|`|d945dd18c2ccb3f0bf1f4c170ff4619faa	No thanks.

No matter I would expect some serious damage. He is capable killing some as small as me with one blow. But I would gamble that i would live and eventually heal up. Then I would be able to help myself and some family get through years of depression -- in some other country under some other government.    I am completely disillusioned with this government. It is accelerating into a place like the old USSR. Maybe they will rename it the USSA, soon. Patriot Act, routine invasions of other countries in the name of "democracy" doesn't wash anymore. I am afraid Rev. Wright was right, the chickens have come home and I don't want to live in this situation. I see it getting worse, not better, no matter whatthey do with the economy. Quality of life is so much worse than a decade ago, for that matter, many decades ago. The plasma tvs, microwave ovens, cell fones and such are not a good trade. They choose to trade some precious intangibles for "stuff" from China. Shiney new "stuff" and people are not better off.|`|7zifiisiaa	Yes|`|Cie6smHaaa	Will I lose my face?|`|dKCHFWClaa	no, but i'd do it for a cookie|`|HQWpJhwKaa	it would most likely break your neck if you were just standing there        so no|`|0LBNKveLaa	no im a ******* supermodel|`|DD219aCVaa	i would turn gay for 1 million dollars.|`|SalYidbvaa	id let him kick my sac for an extra million|`|speJXeIhaa	Nope.I'd cry and i wouldn't want his money anyway.|`|jJ7TWJ2Xaa	yeah den i can get 1 million dollars so ill do the plastic surgery of my face if i loosed it|`|C0KVEE0kaa	Could i get the hole in my head fixed later?

No.|`|kAsfXZzVaa	i might get badly injured but YES|`|PoTY8CNFaa	I'd rather eff a moose|`|VuJsQwz5aa	Well let's see. to fix a broken jaw or something like that would only cost a few thousand.

I've also heard there's a Mexican restaurant open 24 hours a day downtown, like in Market Square or The Mercado or whatever you call it.

They usually do that if they know there will be lots of answers (mostly surveys), and they want their answer to be towards the top, or they want more time to think about an answer.|`|nXUV9lH1aa	edit|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	I find them funny, because I usually report them for either not answering, or point gaming.|`|L0ft1eo7aa	edit    no se|`|JU26EGAeaa	so they can edit it later.    and they reserve a stop closer to the top.    duhh|`|8ryZyVUOaa	Edit nah jj i dnt get it tho.|`|juraRlbkaa	Edit|`|goM4NtsEaa	i wonder too  i think they mean to say edit the question|`|jJ7TWJ2Xaa	seriously dun knw .............maybe dey dont have da appropriate answer and dun want to embarass their selves infront of everyone by giving wrong answer|`|kbCh76Uhaa	It's mostly for Avatar games, I guess.|`|K2tWJE1Vaa	They don't know the answer to it...JUST WANT THE 2 POINTS|`|nE9BaUWIaa	They got sidetracked while thinking up an answer.|`|PvwZdLuLaa	Lol. It looks like you got a lot of those "edit" answers huh? I really had no idea before I read your answers. I always thought it just appeared when you pushed the "edit" button underneath your questions... you learn something new everyday I guess.|`|7Ipnhhaqaa	EDIT|`|yLoksHiFaa	they're marking their spot on the answer board.|`|4cQSsDaZaa	i dont know that means that they edited their comment before they put it on or after they put it on , they edited!!! dur dur durr|`|pNUtnoC8aa	They want to be the first to answer|`|96be0db999d7bda8f54b895d3a0e90e0aa	It means they will be back to finish there answer.|`|hsDrlYMPaa	They do it so they can be one of the first on the list to answer the question.  When they post edit, it means they will return to their answer and complete it in a way that will take more thought than just one word.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Ribbit,oh frog talk for edit.they do it to see the answers you get first then take ideas from other people and elaborate them to get best answer,cheaters i think you call them,ribbit.

I have several friends I've only met online (and have been trying for YEARS to meet in person, darn our "real" lives), but yes.  It's all in how meaningful the conversations are - when you can share your soul with someone, they share theirs with you, and you enjoy spending time with one another - what else would it be?|`|Hm08ZR7yaa	no. if you can chat to them onlinebut dont have the courage or guts or conversation starters to talk to them in real life, then they arent considered a real friend.

I think this way because lions are very competitive for the food that they want.  They will be very ferocious just to get what they want.  IF they don;t get it, they will kill the other animals to get the coconuts from the tree.|`|60JgxXVpaa	the squirrel|`|h52mKmdsaa	chimpanzee bekuz he could climb up fast and actually grab the bannanna!|`|gwEubXRjaa	u cant pluck banana from a coconut tree.|`|mS3Bhc3xaa	none. they all kill eachother first|`|mUMMLjDdaa	giraffe

I think anyone that's called "hot," by definition or stereotype is usually very fake looking or slutty. Being called pretty probably means that he doesn't totally want to just get with you. But, I would rather be called beautiful because of my personality and love for life and everyone else :)|`|ED5jRupoaa	"Hot" just seems skanky nowadays, like the PussyCat Dolls. Pretty would be just fine with me. As if that'll ever happen.|`|UnbudISCaa	What about being called Beautiful?|`|kAsfXZzVaa	i'd rather be called beautiful|`|GAxhD5yZaa	I'd rather be called Beautiful. :)
