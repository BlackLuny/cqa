NgnbtaORaa	Firstly, you don't look fat or unhealthy at all in your picture you look normal.  In fact, it is very natural to have fat on stomach especially around your teenage years as you are maturing - that is where we gain the expression 'puppy fat' from.<br>  <br>  If you are uncomfortable about it you can take up jogging 3-4 times a week for about a mile, or two, at a time.  Do a few exercises targeting your abdominal muscles, for example; leg raises, sit-ups and crunches.  On top of this balance out your dietary intake of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and vitamins and minerals.<br>  <br>  It is a myth that not eating very much throughout the day slims you down - all that accomplishes is slowing down your metabolism and your body stores up those calories in fat.<br>  <br>  Eating Little, but OFTEN, throughout the day helps speed your body's metabolism up and therefore break fats down quicker and releasing, NOT STORING, more energy throughout the day.  Four small balanced meals a day will lose you more weight than having only one, average to large, meal a day will, so bear that in mind.|`|fia9gMHpaa	Eat half or 3/4 of what you eat know and walk or jog or bike or swim everyday. If you eat smaller portions it will help for sure. Can you give a picture of you standing up, because when you are sitting like you are, it all just bunches together?|`|ClsrJj7daa	the research states you cannot lose fat in certain areas. Try to do cardio atleast for 45 min each day and then try toning exercises for the abd.<br>  I also have the same problem, including flab in my upper arms, and have been doing cardio for 4 months now. I have lost some inches off my abdomen, but the bulk is still there<br>  I am trying to do pilates, few times a week, will see how it goes|`|sV0DUJD3aa	it's not even that bad! but if you're bothered about it do sit ups every night and you will notice a difference.|`|1tjJPHpMaa	You just need to tone up. Start running everyday and doing sit ups, crunches, and leg lifts.|`|TLux1kbraa	you needs to lift weights, your arms are like tooth picks|`|9YRgP2rtaa	You are only 14 I wouldn't worry to much about this, odds are you will grow into your body,you are still very young. If it bothers you alot just do sit ups about thirty to forty every night, you should see results in justa few weeks....Remeber nothing happens over night:)|`|b5ee51da3a720189de576c83c7640e82aa	Everyone in the world has "rolls" when they bend over. You're not fat... we're all just our own worst critics. Don't be so hard on yourself. <br>  <br>  If you really want to tone up join a sport at your school like soccer. Great way to have fun, meet people and get in shape.|`|HsrRNnIBaa	You don't have rolls. You have a little fat, but that's natural for a girl and you shouldn't try to get rid of it. Your belly looks good.
CuVnpxh3aa	Sounds like anxiety attacks. You are worrying about your heart and it is NOT your heart. I believe your Dr acted correctly, you did not need an EKG. You said it has been going on for 2-3 years, something would have happened by now if it was your heart. I had a heart attack as did my brother (at 39 y/o) and my Dad and my husband and you are not having heart problems. Everyone has palpitations when under stress, that is probably what you are feeling in your chest when you get nervous. They are nothing to worry about, everyone has them when stressed. You are making yourself nauseous by worrying so much. a heart palpitation makes it feel like your heart is skipping a beat, I have them all the time and they are caused from stress. You need to stop worrying, you are fine and so is your heart. You need to relax. Go for a walk, listen to music, exercise, call and talk to our friends, watch a movie or comedy, do whatever it takes to get your mind off of it. Quit worrying, you ARE fine.|`|5fcM3HLsaa	It sounds like you *might* have an anxiety disorder, especially considering that you mentioned that you worry about it quite a bit. Anxiety can cause alarming physical pain, without there actually being anything wrong - people often go to A+E with a severe chest pain, when they're just having a panic attack. Anxiety can also cause recurring pain and strange sensations, just like those that you mentioned, and it is a very common disorder.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to go to your doctor again and fully explain your concerns. Perhaps he will send you for a chest x-ray or to a cardiologist. If he is dismissive again, then you might ask for a second opinion.<br>  <br>  But you should definitely go back and see your doctor - nobody here can give you a proper diagnosis. Hope I've been of some help.|`|o9GNDREIaa	I prescribe you to 3 doses (bowls) of medical marijuana a day and make sure you use a bong or steam roller.<br>  Jus ask anything else if you curious.<br>  Thx.|`|tqFdbFPNaa	Sounds like anxiety attacks, quit worrying about your heart your fine.
6wGkycFAaa	Yes, calling a dermatologist is exactly what you want to do. They can erase or at least lessen the appearance of them dramatically through lazer treatment. It is expensive but perhaps worth it. Many offices offer payment plans due to the cost being high. (A plastic surgeon wouldn't likely help with an issue such as this one.) <br>  There are also products available that claim to be able to lessen the look of scars. Mostly they are creams and oils with high doses of vitamin E in them. I have tried many on acne scars and have never had an ounce of luck. I'm guessing they can't fulfil the promises they make. If you have the money to spend trying to find one that works, I think you'd be better off saving it toward lazer which is faster and more likely to give you the results you are looking for.<br>  I wish you much success and good health.|`|WKsGpvEIaa	How exactly do you plan on getting rid of a scar? With a bigger scar? Chicken pox scars are generally small and as far as I know, there's nothing you can do about them.  You're just looking at them the wrong way.  Don't be ashamed or embarrassed of them.  It's something from your life that happened to you.  If you want to, come up with some cool story about getting into a fight, or an accident, or something like that.
CuVnpxh3aa	Keep your arm really warm and your arm hanging down as much as possible before your turn to donate. A warm arm makes the blood flow better as does having it hanging down to get the blood in the arm to be drawn from. Also keep making a fist to "pump" the blood into the arm. "Fist and release, fist and release" until your time to donate. This should help.|`|CkUjIA1maa	The things you can have some control over are blood volume and blood pressure. Make sure you drink extra water when you are going to donate, and eat something salty before your appointment to raise the blood pressure.<br>  <br>  I've had the same problem myself, and found that being very well hydrated before donating really seems to help.
TKNPveHDaa	Adkins doesn't work very well.  Your body can't adjust to the poor diet.

VLRZT9Foaa	Very normal.  I always slow the speed to a stop (taking about a minute to come to a stop) and this helps the dizziness a lot.|`|WrUTuQdlaa	You have to cool off longer. Usually 5 to 10 min for every 30 min.|`|1tjJPHpMaa	No, you overdid it. And, you need 8 glasses of water, not 6.|`|518tyZveaa	The same thing happens to me!  I just stand still on the treadmill (after my cool down) and after about a minute, that feeling does wear off.  I don't think it is because you are doing anything wrong or not drinking enough water...although drinking alot of water certainly doesn't hurt!  I have asked a few of my friends too and the general consencus is that this is a very common reaction.|`|motboEMNaa	check your blood sugar, you might become hypoglycemic.|`|T4Eu6zL1aa	drink water or eat an orange before you run.

RAP6Nn6Naa	Simple easy exercises are very good for say, maintaining your weight.  If indeed that's what you want, then a few crunches, sit-ups, leg-lifts, and do remember to stretch.  All of those, a 10-15 minute/3x day, workout will be great just to keep you on top of not gaining any weight. <br>  <br>  Now if you are wanting to lose weight I suggest a little cardio workout, getting your heart rate going and for at least 30 minutes at a time.  You could run-in-place if you can't get out and run around your neighborhood.  Pushups and situps can both be cardio too if you do them with a fast pace and try not to cheat, because your only wasting your own time and cheating yourself.  Good luck|`|uTPeYO4kaa	do you really expect results with "easy exercises"|`|BlMNm9Ccaa	Get an exercise DVD. The one that we are doing has 3 different levels of intensity.

xqQO81Omaa	That's pretty lean for a female, almost into the athletic range.<br>  <br>  The healthy range of body fat for females is approx 19%-29%. Only very athletic females would be in the 13%-17% range due to the extra muscle (anything less would be underfat).|`|AjBpAPpdaa	It's good, if it's under 18.5 than you're underweight|`|580Htbj5aa	im 5'3" && 96 lbs. &&& by body fat is less than that!!!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  just love tha way u r && don't change just cuz u think that ur 2 big cuz there's other people who r 10x ur weight!!!!|`|1tjJPHpMaa	That's good.

CkUjIA1maa	Facial skin is highly vascular so it heals quickly and is very forgiving.  I had the same kind of "beauty mark" (which I called an "ugly mark") removed about 10 years ago, and have never regretted it.  The mole was cut off at skin level with a blade, and the scar is not really even noticeable unless I point it out to someone. The procedure took about 3 minutes in the dermatology office where I worked, healed in about a week, and that was that.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|00ad97897648101cc10f52e12966697daa	I had a couple of moles taken off my face.

There are a lot of other mental problems besides Schizophrenia that have the symptoms you're talking about.  There's Social Anxiety Disorder, SchizoTypal Disorder, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Panic Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, all of which probably have that as a symptom.  To really diagnose this person, the person needs to see a psychiatrist.  <br>  Sizoden is usually used for Schizophrenia, but it's used for other disorders too (including Borderline Personality Disorder, Bi-Polar etc.)  There are a lot of drugs out there for Schizophrenia, Sizodon is not the most often used drug, but it's up there.<br>  But from what you've said, I don't think that's serious enough to consider Schizophrenia, at least not now.

When we breath in, oxygen passes through the lungs and is absorbed into the bloodstream. We then breathe carbon dioxide back into the air. But if breathing is too shallow, the body does not eliminate enough carbon dioxide through the mucous membranes of the lungs. The primary causes of faulty breathing are anxiety or stress, poor posture, clothing that is too tight and, in some cases, surgery.<br>  Here is the Abdominal Breathing that will help with the tension in your back.<br>  1. Lie down on the floor with your calves resting on a chair or stool<br>  2. Place 3 books on your abdomen over your navel. Breathe deeply and calmly. Feel the weight of the books on your belly.<br>  3. Remove 1 book. Notice that your belly feels lighter and your breathing is deeper. Remove the other books, 1 at a time, pausing in between to focus on the feeling of the breathing deeply.<br>  4. At the end of the exercise, place your hands on your belly and consciously breathe from your abdomen for a few minutes.<br>  In most cases of seeing a doctor, they will also show you some exercises to help with the back pain.<br>  I seen a doctor when I had a pinch nerve in my back, and they only give you some pills to help relieve the pain, and not much of anything else.<br>  And having kinks in the body is just bad gases in the body that are trying to be worked out, might even want to spend the extra money and getting a good massage. Think if you go to the Collage of massage, it's like 25.00 for a hour.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, good luck. :)|`|NWIkwLZFaa	If you have been feeling stressed at all that could cause the pain in your back.

5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	The purpose of it is to make the PT a better practicioner to accept direct access.  This includes the ability to screen for underlying medical problems that require referral to a physician and to have a better understanding of the the entire medical process such as effects of medication and understanding radiological tests.  <br>  <br>  If one is practicing in a state where there is no direct access, it's probably not really necessary, but the trend is towards making physical therapy a direct access provider (ie, going to the PT without first having to obtain a referral from your physician) in all states. <br>  <br>  If you consider the basic education a PT needs...bio, chem, physics, math and psych as well as general education credits...this rarely can be completed in any less than 3 years...consider it takes 3 years to have a good solid basis in the core PT courses, now you are already at at least a 6 year master's degree.  Really, though, the undergraduate education takes usually four years, so now you are already at 7 years of education. So the DPT falls somewhere between a master's degree and a PhD...<br>  <br>  Having graduated originally from a BS program where everything was "crammed" into two years pre-professional and two years professional, the DPT is much better. Having gone back and finished the DPT, I understand where the MPT and BS programs were a little too superficial.

AA11375099	this is how our time line went:<br>  <br>  Discovery of lump around December of 07, then we forgot about it because of things going on....<br>  <br>  (So for yours it would be self discovery or discovery by mammogram.)<br>  <br>  Then in late June of 08 a cyst developed on her breast and she remembered the lump.  Now we go in for her cyst and with tests a tumor is discovered.<br>  <br>  Once there is confirmation of a tumor you make sure you see a doctor, the only doctor available to us in the clinic at the time was a breast surgeon.  He ordered the tests, (and there were many different kinds took about 2 weeks to finally have them all done)<br>  <br>  We than knew what kind of cancer we were dealing with.  He recommended a breast cancer oncologist.  She would not accept us unless we had a port put in so that was next.  A small surgery done to put a port in the chest that connects to a vein where chemotherapy drugs are administered, and blood tests done.<br>  <br>  After that we talked to the oncologist, and she confirmed what the surgeon told us that it was indeed a tumor.  She had was familiar with the kind of breast cancer we had so she told us what was best for us to do and we are doing it.<br>  <br>  Blood tests are done, and then chemotherapy treatments begin (15 weeks of it)<br>  <br>  Tumor is reduced in size and surgery begins (Mastectomy)<br>  <br>  After surgery then 12 weeks of a different kind of chemotherapy.<br>  <br>  Physical therapy sessions begin.<br>  <br>  A two week wait and then radiation for 6.5 weeks (every day except the weekends)<br>  <br>  <br>  Breaking it down:  <br>  <br>  1. Discovery of breast cancer<br>  2. Finding doctor to schedule tests<br>  3.Test results are back<br>  4. Port put in for chemotherapy<br>  5. Reduction of Tumor by various chemotherapy drugs<br>  6. Removal of breast and 14 lymph nodes<br>  7. More Chemotherapy<br>  8. Physical Therapy<br>  9. Radiation<br>  10. Follow up checks every three months for a year to oncologist<br>  11. After two years every 6 months until five years.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, some people will get the tumor removed before radiation, it is up to the oncologist.<br>  <br>  This does not include any kind of professional consoling, (we did that with two people after the diagnosis for 5 weeks.)|`|rXSXuHeEaa	check out the sites below

vLcOoy5paa	How much you can grow is really based upon a few different factors: genetics, diet, time dedicated, routine, and rest.  The problem with the supplement industry is they usually show a experienced lifter in their off season, and then right before competition.  Lifters usually put on 15-20 during their off season, and then go through a strict 12 week diet.  So strict that they dehydrate themselves to make their skin like paper to show every vein and muscle.  <br>  <br>  If you're just getting started I would recommend the following supplements: 100% Whey Protein Powder and a multi-vitatimin.  Once you are comfortable with weight lifting & have proper form, begin to cycle in NO Explode.  Don't take fat burners, as most have been shown to actually decrease muscle mass because they don't only attack the fat.  <br>  <br>  You should be consuming 1.5-2 grams of protein for every lb that you weigh.  A reasonable goal (for muscle gain) is about 10-12 lbs a year.  I like having a protein shake before lifting, after lifting, and as a night snack.  Caseine Protein is best before bed because it takes longer for your body to digest, and your body won't "starve" while it sleeps.<br>  <br>  Obviously you need to follow a strict diet (for muscle mass gains I would recommend eating 300 more calories a day than your BMR), lift 4-5 days a week with 48hours of rest for each muscle group.  Muscle & Fitness usually puts togeather a great diet plan for those that are currently in the bulking phase.  You'll need to do a little bit of cardio, but not alot.  Your focus needs to be on building muscle mass.  Now, this doesn't mean that you can just eat & eat & eat, you need to consume the right balance of nutrients.  Once you're happy with the muscle mass you've gained, you can transition to the cutting phase.  You'll continue to lift, but you'll put more time into cardio & a caloric deficit.  <br>  <br>  I highly recommend www.bodybuilding.com 's article archive.  They will have all kinds of articles on bulking and cutting.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|tIldpr7vaa	Ok, first off, No Cell tech, its an over priced BS joke of a product. Its just creatine with a ton of sugar added, and they pay a bunch of big dudes to pose with it. <br>  If u wanna try creatine, just buy some cheap generic unflavored powder. Same stuff as expensive name brands, will work just as well. <br>  <br>  Also dont bother with NO products ( nitric oxide/ nitro... ) they have been proven to be bunk, and not help with muscle growth.<br>  <br>  Best option is to go for a whey protein powder, ON %100 Whey is a solid product. And of course alot of good healthy protein rich foods. Food is the best muscle builder.
6YnwXCIaaa	Your coccyx.  <br>  <br>  You should probably go to the doctor if you're having any problems urinating or with bowel movements or if you start to lose feeling in your genital area.

If it last longer than a week, go to the doctor.|`|nwzACkGwaa	That is your coccyx also known as your tail bone.  I am sure you probably just bruised it, and it will start to feel better after a few days to a week.  It will take a while for it to heal since it's a bruised bone and there are a lot of nerves so it's going to hurt more than a bruise on your arm, plus it's a part of your body that is effected just about anytime you walk or try to get comfortable in bed.  I fell a few years back on some ice and my feet went straight out from under me, all of my weight came down on my tail bone- talk about pain! I think it took a good week and a half to two weeks before I could walk or turn over in bed with out it hurting.  The first week- every time I would move the pain was so bad that it would take my breath away.  I never went to the doctor because I didn't have any numbness or problems with bowls or urination (blood or not being able to go) so there wouldn't of been much they could have done...even if it was broken.<br>  So, my guess is that you bruised your coccyx and it's going to be sore for a while.  If it were broken you would probably be at the doctor now because you would be in so much pain.  Give it a week or so to heal- unless of course you have problems/blood in urinating, bowl movements, or numbness or pain in your pelvic area or even your legs.  Chances are you bruised it and there's nothing the doctor would be able to do for it.  Use ice packs and take ibuprofen to help with the swelling and pain.
CHiEKZrLaa	Changing your habits can be really challenging!<br>  <br>  I've had a few patients who quit by painting their nails bright blue.  It sounds odd, I know... but you'd be surprised how much blue fingernails catch your attention.  Since it tends to be an unconscious habit, the attention-grabbing blue nails help do the trick.  (Blue seems to work better than other colors.  No idea why.  Maybe it's unusual.  Maybe it's unappetizing?)<br>  <br>  For the $5 cost of some blue nail polish, I'd give it a go!<br>  <br>  NOTE:  The dietary link is interesting, too... it'd take a lot more info to figure that one out, so I can't offer any specifics.

AA11622618	Trying to answer your question leads me to understand that is not about catholics or not, due to the fact that religion is overcomed by culture, and this has an extremus variety in every country.

It doesn't work for *all* women, but it does help many... and for some, it can get rid of cramps entirely for a while.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.h...</a><br>  <br>  "... an orgasm can cause your uterus to contract, enabling it to use up excess prostaglandins in the process. Prostagladins are hormones produced by your uterine lining. They help to stimulate contractions that move menstrual blood out of the uterus, and are also responsible for those cramps that occur throughout your period."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kadir-buxton.com/page8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kadir-buxton.com/page8.htm</a><br>  <br>  "Primary Menstrual Cramps can be a debilitating problem for some 10% of women. Conventional treatment can even be as drastic as exploratory surgery whilst looking for a cure. A less intrusive solution is available. Orgasm from masturbation has been found to relieve the painful symptoms of menstrual cramps. Whilst it is not always convenient to masturbate for the necessary five minutes until the pain subsides, hands free masturbation is still possible. In order to do this one simply has to clench and then relax the vagina repeatedly for five minutes. With this method no one need know of the discomfort being suffered, and the pain soon goes.

Tell your mum to shut up good luck|`|4mXqv6IZaa	First of all, I don't believe anyone under 18 should go on any type of restrictive diet to lose weight.  That's not to say you can't change your eating habits for better health throughout your life.  Cut back on candy, soda and chips.  Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Stay active.  You truly don't sound over weight so I wouldn't worry about that so much.  Just learn good habits now and you will be healthier as an adult.  Tell your mom that since you are a minor, she is responsible for what you eat. A quick guideline for what a meal should consist of is:<br>  Divide a normal round diner plate into 4 slices (use your imagination).  Once 1/4 of your plate should be lean protein, fish, chicken, turkey, tofu, lean beef, lean pork.  Another 1/4 of your plate should be starch such as rice, potatoes, noodles etc.  The other 1/2 should consist of vegetables.  Steamed are best.  Also, start your meal with a large salad of colorful greens.  Either use lite dressing or if you use the full calorie stuff, decrease the amount you use.  Good luck and tell your mom to back off.|`|1tjJPHpMaa	Your mom shouldn't say things like that to you. You aren't even overweight. Besides, you are only 13.|`|4I70V3FAaa	I think your mom is stupid.

1scRwbLRaa	Please don;t listen to that ditz "Bubblez".<br>  <br>  When embarking on a diet plan, drink plenty of fluids, ie water, 100% juices, green tea, etc. Your body naturally retains water. But when you drink a lot (and you might be slightly overdoing it with 6 500ml bottles) your body starts losing the water it has been retaining for survival purposes. <br>  There are tons of articles out there promoting drinking water. Especially while dieting. Just Google and you will see that your body is dropping that "water weight" for a reason. And you shouldn't stop drinking the recommended amount because you might be scared you will "retain" some of it. You are SUPPOSED to retain at least a portion of what you drink. That's why they say lay off the sodas; you don't want your body to hold on to all that sugar and the additives while trying to lose weight. Water has no additives!<br>  <br>  EDIT: 8 8oz. glasses of water is what every person should be drinking. If you've ever tried to drink that in a day you know that you just don't have time for all those other drinks. <br>  And you will probably lose high numbers until you plateau because that does sound like the average water weight lost.|`|crlYXrn7aa	ok! water is good for you but you cant drink it all the time! if you do... im NOT kiddin! you may die! too much water will fill up your lungs and its bad.

Bubbles knows NOTHING about water intoxication!<br>  <br>  You cant and i say agian CAN NOT DIE from drinking "too much" water.

uJKTR4d2aa	Yes, but i suggest believe it or not to not do it again at night. You HAVE to start off slow hun. If you keep thinkign you have to do it twice a day other factors will come in and make you quit.<br>  <br>  You have done 30 mins. The recomended daily time frame. Thats good. Be happy and rest the rest of the day. Do that 5 times a week, of 30 mins. <br>  <br>  After 2-3 weeks, or even a month, whenever your ready, increase it to 1 hour 3 times a week. Then to 1 hour 5 times a week.<br>  <br>  You slowly build up, your body will be getting fit, and it wont mind doing more and more like that. You will lose weight, take it slow though and give it time. Good luck|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	A start is always good. Remember that you are in an endurance race with this project, so you have to stay on track and be consistent.<br>  <br>  Another thing that surprises a lot of people attempting to lose weight, is that you need to eat several times a day. Smaller portions of healthy meals/snacks will help. You have to reignite the body's natural furnace that burns fuel (food) and converts it to available energy. That can't be done by starving yourself (which actually puts on weight because your body converts the available fuel to stored fat).|`|hPDMDrTqaa	Thats a great way to get started, also I reccomend doing a lot of Calisthenics, Push ups, jumping jacks, crunches, pull ups, ect.<br>  <br>  Do 20 push ups, 20-30 crunches, 20-30 jumping jacks (more if you like), 20 lunges, 20 leg lifts. Also look up other Calisthenics that you think you'd like to do and add them into your routine, then every week increase the amount you do by 5 or 10 and you'll be on your way to losing weight fast. Also note that I didn't add a run or a walk into this as I think your 1.5 mile walk twice a day is good, as you lose weight or build muscle and get used to the walk I'd start increasing the walk weekly by 1/2 a mile, then after you feel your ready start jogging instead starting off with a 1/2 mile jog and increasing it gradually by 1/2 or 1/4 a mile.<br>  <br>  Also drink lots of water and try not to intake more than 2000 calories a day, try to eat a lot of protein in your diet, and I reccomend protein shakes, but make sure you stay within 2,000 calories.|`|JsffWlnEaa	not too bad...eat 500 calories less a day to loose a 1lb. in a week
ZjhQ6PL8aa	Tropinin, Myoglobin and CKMB are related to heart damage they typically peak in the first few days after onset of symptoms and go down after that.  As far as a specific level to be concerned about anything above 0.5-1 is something going on that needs to be further looked at.  I've seen them as high as 40.  However that's seldom as I work in an ER.  In my experience their measured in ng/mL.  If you have trouble getting a hold of the cardiologist then talk to the internist which is the hospitalist responsible for admission of that specific patient.  That physician should have no problem taking a min to explain things to you.|`|eab67f43c0cff3a2dc3c807267bbd536aa	High T from heart damage mostly will last 10-14 days then drop.  Normal 0-.05ng.

Perhaps it is over filled. Did she check the bite? (That's when they tell you to bite down on either blue or red little pieces of paper) <br>  <br>  However, if it was a big filling like you say, you may indeed need a root canal. If hot temperature starts to bother it, that is usually an indicator that your tooth is dying. If cold bothers it, it could mean it's dying, but generally it could be because there is too much filling material. Tap on it. If it hurts when you tap on it, you're looking at a root canal. Percussion and pressure sensitivity general indiciate that's what you need. (The tooth could also be fractured all the way through and could need to be extracted.)<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep your dental office in the loop as the pain changes.|`|XCtjuhujaa	a week...but the sensitivity stayz 4 afew mnthxz<br>  <br>  xXx Matt xXx|`|XZlFLecLaa	it shouldnt be hurting now... too much time has passed... if it was a big enough cavity and filling ... you may need a root canal... maybe see another dentist for a second opinion....

I know you said you eat healthy, but do you eat any fats.  Some fats are not bad,  Another thing is before you eat, drink 8 oz of water,and you will eat less.  I too have back problems, sciatica and 3 types of arthritis.  I ride my bike as much as I can because there's not a lot i can do.  Like you, when I can, I walk because sciatica is so painful when it shoots down your leg.  I love to swim.  By the way, I went on a diet 9 yrs ago by staying off fats and lost 70 Lbs.  I don't know what the equivalent is to stones, but I'm maintaining my weight.  Another thing I use by my Dr. advice is Alli.  He gave it to me when it first came out by prescription.  It lowered my cholesterol from 350 to 154.  It's the only diet pill approved by the FDA.  I don't know if you can get that over the counter where you live.  I wish you the best.<br>  EDIT Oh you have a husband that can eat and eat and never gain too huh.  It's not fair.  What is it about men that don't gain  weight.

hPDMDrTqaa	I eat over 2,000 calories a day, I used to never exercise, but now i do regularly and quite intensely since I am preparing for boot camp. I used to be able to eat whatever I want and not gain weight and I still do, but let me tell you its not all that great to be able to because you don't feel healthy and it does effect the amount of energy you have when you over-eat even if you don't gain weight. I used to feel very unhealthy but since I started regularly running and doing Calisthenics a lot I've become much more healthy and I've lowered my body fat % quite a bit (Even though I used to be skinny now I'm skinnier but look better).|`|uJKTR4d2aa	I can eat whatever i want and not gain anything now since i exercise daily.

But it is not that fun, he has to sit in front of computer like 12 hrs a day.
36a3ynpJaa	I know someone who does it twice a year and they lose about a pound a day while on the cleanse and get back about half.  The main thing is that it is very boring.  Lemonade with maple syrup and pepper-- salt cleanses.  You have to get up early for the salt cleanses since you will have to go to the bathroom and you will not want to be on the road when it happens.<br>  <br>  The Master Cleanse Diet has been around for about 40 years and people have gone as long as 60 days on it.  A 3-10 day cleanse is typical.|`|TKNPveHDaa	Not at all.  Detoxes are dangerous and stupid.

Try the following.<br>  <br>  1.    Eating cleaner( lean proteins such as skinless chicken breasts, turkey, fish and lean cut steak, cuts that have the words top or loin in them).  Also eat 5-6 smaller meals a day.  I eat half a turkey sandwich for lunch amd eat the rest a couple of hours later.  I still eat the same amount but I spread it out.<br>  <br>  2. Strength training.  try using free weights instead of machines. and Try doing compound exercises such as squats and lunges.  These exercises not only target your lower body, but they also work other muscles, thus burning more fat and getting more bang for your buck.  You should know that weight training not only burns fat but builds lean muscle, which in my opinion is the number 1 way to keep the weight off.<br>  <br>  3. Finally, start doing high intensity Interval training(HIIT) for your cardio.  This has been proven to burn 9 times more fat that traditional cardio.  It only takes 20 minutes ad works like this.<br>  minutes 1-2( work out at an easy pace, this is your warm up)<br>  minute 3 (workout at a moderate pace; 3.0 MPH on a treadmill or a level 4 resistance on a bike)<br>  minute 4 (workout at a hard pace; 5-6.0 MPH on a treadmill or a level 8-10 resistance on a bike)<br>  Complete the moderate and hard intervals until minute 18 then go to a cool down for miutes 19 and 20.

RhlGVbAraa	The best way to tone your butt/legs is to use weights.  There is no need for extreme heavy lifting, simply use moderate weight (enough to make you feel the burn).  Great exercises are: Squats of any kind, lunges, and russians (google for examples on how to do these properly).  another way is through cardio.  The Stair stepper is a great way to tone your butt, but the key to this workout is to NOT HOLD ON TO THE RAILS!  also the treadmill works okay, but running outside, such as in parks, works tremendously better.

If you get a tingling sensation, it could be the valves not functioning properly and this can lead to some inflamation of the blood vessels later in life. If the valves dont work properly, your veins can rupture. Now THATS pain. Be carefull. <br>  <br>  You can start by giving youself a little anti gout treatment. Do this by mixing a teaspoon of honey into a glass of water with 3 teaspoons of Apple cider vinegar. It may clear up the problem within 3 days. Also make sure you drink a lot or water or even beer (if you can) to flush out the kidneys. <br>  <br>  If this doesnt work, go see a doctor. Your veins are clogged. Its not something to take lightly|`|mSt1LGfjaa	you could have a pinched nerve in your back,but you do need to have it checked out ,there is restless leg syndrome too ..and it makes your legs do that,,wish you the best.

You might be able to get some nitrous to breathe while you get injected so you care less about the whole needle thing.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	They can.... or you can suck it up and save a couple hundred.|`|5X09CywPaa	A dentist does not use needles to do a deep cleaning.

You can ask them to put some novocaine on your gums to numb the area, but I would not recommend anesthesia.|`|yDfbQOTjaa	you're scared of needles but you would want to be anesthesized which has terrible side effects and could kill you? how do you think they will administer the anesthesia?|`|456dzEBfaa	No
KAwYumFfaa	There is no sure fire way to overcome that by yourself, alone. I too suffer the same faith though lately i can go longer than i did before. If you really want to overcome it you can use medications. I use an antidepressant sertraline (zoloft). It has a lot of side effects and one of em is that you will be ejaculate a little bit longer (way longer!)... Though, you might go for the lesser dosage so to minimize the side effects. Zoloft, i think, is over-the-counter drug and may not need prescription. That is the only remedy i knw. Also, jerking off days before you'll have sex. Will help, a little...

oVxr5B3Eaa	Maybe not a toothache so much, but for sure if you got an infection. You ears are connected to your throat through a little tube called the Eustachian tube so it could easily spread to an ear infection that way. <br>  If you were given penicillin it's likely because of an infection. <br>  But yeah, the Eustachian tube connects your throat to your ear so any problems there can lead to hearing problems.|`|07658108bf84ff22af742f784fa5ea0aaa	Yes, it can.  Give it some time and try to relax.  Your hearing will come back.|`|V87HfMhuaa	It is possible to have a bad tooth infection and get conductive hearing loss.  It sounds like you are already getting the proper treatment, so I'm sure that you're hearing will come back once the infection is gone.  Make sure you are not overdosing on motrin or aspirin either.  Besides the increased risk of bleeding internally, aspirin toxicity (overdose) can cause hearing problems as well.|`|bDuIczfHaa	About two months ago I woke up and my hearing was about 85% gone. What i could hear, sounded absolutely awkward...my ears felt like they were full of cotton and everything i could hear was muffled. My doctor put me on a z-pack and it did absolutely nothing for me. He put me on something else (levaquin, i believe), and it did absolutely nothing for me. One of my friends told me to go visit my dentist and he took x-rays and discovered that I had an infected tooth. He put me on penicillin and tylenol with codeine for the pain, and told me to stop taking aspirin and other pain medications and just take the tylenol with codeine. After about a week i started to regain some of my hearing. It's been several weeks since I've been on the penicillin and tylenol with codeine, but ive also stopped taking other pain medications to avoid having an overdose on them. Right now my hearing is at about 70 to 75% of what it was prior to the day I woke up with my hearing problems. My high range hearing is gone and i can no longer hear things like drum cymbals, tambourines and wind chimes when listening to music, nor keys or loose change jingling. At this point I have no idea if this is permanent, but I certainly hope not... however I have no doubt that my tooth infection caused this, and I will be having either a root canal done or having the tooth yanked, next week.... i don't know how long it will take for my hearing to be back at 100% or if if it will even return to the way it used to. Basically, my advice to you is, stop the aspirin, stop the ibuprofen, ask your doctor to prescribe you tylenol with codeine, take that and only that with your penicillin, and get to a dentist as soon as possible. It may take several months for your hearing to return back to normal, but freaking out does not help (trust me, i had about two straight weeks of that and the stress is not worth the agony, what's done is done and worrying about it will not make it any better). I hope you do improve quickly (the penicillin should be taking effect soon), and i would like to hear of your follow up actions with the dentist and the results of your hearing improvement.
LuIFkPfwaa	If you have six crowns then you would only replace the damaged one.  If you have a bridge that is replacing six teeth then you will probably have to replace the whole bridge.
IjTQ8b8naa	Everyone is different but regardless it usually hurts everyone for at least 4-5 days and for those days I suggest prescription pain killers which the gave you I am sure for the first two days and the next couple something just like regular painkillers like advil or tylenol.|`|I8lFqyyFaa	Dry socket is when the blood clot gets removed from the surgery site, exposing the bone and everything, so it is very painful.  Now you started in the first couple days with a blood clot, so an indicator would be if you had a sudden uptick in the level of pain you are experiencing.  Dry socket can last a bit less than a week.  <br>  <br>  All that soreness you're describing is typical and just related to all the tugging they had to do on your jaw to get the tooth out.  Keep taking your pain meds.|`|Six4abRlaa	Call your dentist. I wouldn't think your mouth should be hurting so much.
n6IBfiDPaa	Has he become a vampire?!
I8lFqyyFaa	The worst part honestly is the injections for the local anesthetic.  And those really aren't so bad.  A bit of a pinch, maybe a little sting, no more.  Those will really block the nerves to your teeth and the tooth removal should be no more than tugging.  You can also see if your dentist has nitrous oxide (laughing gas) available to help you relax.  I never pass over that when available.  You might also take some sort of MP3 player to listen to with music that you think might help distract you a bit.|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	You know that they will take very good care of you.

W8aiAWe2aa	I am glad you are being screened as it is silly for her to say that you are unlikely to have it. many of us can be MRSA carriers without knowing. So yes they will screen you. This is frequently done proper to surgery.<br>  <br>  If you are found to be MRSA positive then the chances are that your op will be postponed until you are free from MRSA. They will treat it with a nasal ointment (antibiotic) if found in your nose.That means that you have to have three consecutive clear swabs before being declared free from MRSA.

Now this, wit thinkin that her husband is cheatin on her! I know shes goin thru a rough time.. The risk for transmission to the newborn is MUCH HIGHER IN WOMEN with primary HSV infections. Neonatal herpes can be localized to skin, eyes, and mouth (45% of cases), involve the central nervous system (30% of cases), or can cause disseminated infection involving multiple organs such as liver, lungs, adrenal glands, and brain. Neonatal disseminated HSV infection is most frequently caused by HSV-2, although HSV-1 can also be the cause. So therefore, ur friends baby more than likely caught tha virus from her bc she had a virus tha last month she was pregnant..

Up to 20% of sexually active people have Herpes which is more easily spread or passed on to a baby if the sores of the virus are currently active.<br>  <br>  Many people with herpes have healthy babies and succesful pregnancies by taking anti-virals.<br>  <br>  My advice would be get get a new boyfriend if she is pretty sure he is cheating.  However he may have had the virus for years. Many people have it all their lives and do not find out until something like this.  Some people have regular outbreaks and some never do.<br>  <br>  She must tell her partners that she has herpes and should get on a drug like Valtex to help prevent spreading it.  Also she needs to have her partner use a condom for his safety and hers.  Valtex and other similar drugs to not stop you from spreading it, but do reduce the chance that you will.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

The fact that it is 'tissue' is incidental, it is still research on people.<br>  <br>  Random thoughts:<br>  Ethical behaviour in research has come a long, long way in the last 50 years.  If there weren't concerns then there wouldn't be laws, consents, and investigational review boards. Personally, I don't really care what some one does with my tissue once it is gone from my body.  But it is a really really  big deal to many many people.|`|MMUeOWXUaa	You can't find anything because there is NO exploitation going on. Any tissue submissions must first have an Informed Consent Form signed BY the patient. This states that the patient gives permission for part of their tissue to be used for future cancer research. Maybe I'm not understanding.|`|vWm1l9nuaa	What do you mean by exploitation? If I had a cancer removed it would definitely make me happy if it was used for improving diagnostics or treatment of this absolutely terrifying disease.|`|AA10698792	Human tissue isn't being exploited for cancer research.  Any tissues that are used are used with the explicit permission of the donor and no other way. If you mean stem cell research, again, the donor must give permission in order for his or her tissues to be used.<br>  <br>  If permission is given, it's not exploitation.<br>  <br>  That's why you can't find anything on it.
VWNiOxcvaa	People should only wear contacts when they need to see clearly mostly in the distance. Contacts for distance are way too strong for up close and will lead to blurrier vision quicker.<br>  <br>  I've heard of people getting 20/80 contacts for up close and getting glasses that bring their vision to 20/30 vision along with contacts for distance.<br>  <br>  With glasses we can take them off for work up close.|`|RgwJ1PNnaa	No more than 10 hours a day is what my optician told me and only for 5 days a week.

kZ2Klv0Daa	You want to maintain your current weight? Someone your size should ideally be thinner, but if you want to maintain it, you should go for 1500 - 2000 calories a day. If you want to lose weight, you need to cut back at least 500 calories from your daily diet (1200 calories is a good place to start).|`|nuDKAPpDaa	If you want to lose 15lbs and maintain it, you need to do it slowly. Aim to lose about 1lb a week, which means (taking into account your height, current weight, age and activity level) you should try to eat about 1500kcal per day. This means that by the end of July (approx), you should have lost about 15lbs. From then on, slowly increase your calorific intake until it is about 1800 or 1900 per day. This should help you to maintain your new weight. Also, if you aim to do a little exercise per day, you can afford to eat a little bit more. Hope this helps!

Usually this is a very orderly process, with signs of physical change which are not medical emergencies, requiring invasive emergency intervention.<br>  These physical changes are normal natural means of which the body prepares itself to stop and the most appropriate kind of responses will be comfort enhancing measures. If the person is in a hospice the Hospice care team will tell you what to expect and how to respond to help your loved one accomplish this transition with support and understanding and ease.The persons hands and arms may become increasingly cooler, to the touch, and the skin may change color. My mother's feet turned blue first. This means the circulation is decreasing to the feet and hand first, the extremities. <br>  At this point I was asked how aggressive I wanted the doctors to be and I said, she has already begun the process, please just let her go. Now I would call all the family in when the extremities start to change color, this means death is imminent and sometimes if a loved one is not present, the person will try to hold on, I know my Mother waited for my son to come to the hospital before she died.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|1a73d713db30921523a95888f8827729aa	There is no single, simple answer to this.  Consider what hemodialysis does:  It cleanses toxins in the blood.  How long it takes those toxins to completely overtake the body's ability to function is a factor of how quickly they build up, and where they build up the most.  Then the failure of each major organ will occur based on the toxicity in each organ.  All of this can be affected by environmental factors, such as nutrition, air, water, and other factors.<br>  <br>  The tipping point is usually when the oxygen levels in the blood or anemia cause the failure of systems on a broad scale.  I would recommend you check out this link:  <a href="http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/Kudiseases/pubs/hemodialysis/" rel="nofollow">http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/Kudiseases/p...</a><br>  <br>  It might help you better understand the process and gain some insight into other, more educated and professional resources (I have no medical training whatsover).

The color of your feces is usually either indicative of what you ate or could be the sign of an illness/infection, but sounds more like you're drinking too much cider!|`|oxsawg31aa	Are u a tramp by any chance? No normal person would drink that much cider, I bet it was something like white lightning. Oh and pooh shouldnt be red, it usually means there's blood in it if it is, and thats probably not good. <br>  <br>  EDIT: Tramp - uni, same thing lol, seriously though red does usually indicate blood, so u might wanna get checked out, or have u been eating alot of beetroot or something??

6wGkycFAaa	It depends on a number of factors. If you are pumping a ton of fat and calories into your body, then you will burn them up with this exercise but if you are not doing other exercise with it, results will be slow.<br>  If you are eating a healthy diet and doing some cardio too you may see results in less than 6 wks. If you are doing the exercise with tension, slowly so the muscles are working hard, are eating properly and doing cardio, you could see results in as little as 3 weeks.<br>  Take a measuring tape and get all your 'before measurements'. Depending on how much you want to work out, measure the appropriate parts. It's hard for your eye to see results and this is a solid way of knowing you are making progress. Others will see it long before you do without a tape measure.<br>  I wish you much luck and good health!!|`|mkyFiylSaa	usually two weeks.|`|FMaci3XMaa	a couple of weeks :)|`|4rA9hhQ2aa	depends on what you eat|`|AA10506180	I think it would take about 2-3 weeks if you stay away from junk food!

ciz0qYwnaa	They have a lot of good fat in them, not the bad one. <br>  <br>  "Almonds are a rich source of Vitamin E, containing 24 mg per 100 g. They are also rich in monounsaturated fat, one of the two "good" fats responsible for lowering LDL cholesterol."<br>  <br>  LDL, low-density lipoprotein, is the bad cholesterol. When you eat saturated and trans fat, your LDL level gets high and your HDL (high-density lipoprotein, the good cholesterol) gets low. Your HDL needs to be higher than your LDL, or else you'll have high cholesterol. <br>  <br>  Almonds are also good for the nervous system and contain some amount of protein, which your body needs to tone up and repair muscle tissues. <br>  <br>  There's about 7 calories per almond. I eat 6 a day : ) <br>  <br>  They won't make you fat. You need this kind of fat in your diet or else you'll turn into a bag of bones like Victoria Beckham, whilst having a few other heart problems and such.|`|1tjJPHpMaa	As long as you don't eat more than a serving and the almonds are unsalted.|`|QRpB5pFXaa	they have a lot of fat in them (about 24% of your daily allowence for 1 ounce) but they also have a lot of vitamin e<br>  <br>  i also found this<br>  "Eating almonds has the same effect as the cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins. A one and a half ounce handful of almonds is a leading source of vitamin E and magnesium and offers protein, fiber, potassium, calcium, phosphorus and iron in 246 calories. Also, almonds (and other nuts) contain phytochemicals, which are plant chemicals that may provide powerful protection against heart disease, stroke, and other chronic diseases."|`|NOUL05wUaa	A cup of almonds a day is good for you it's a good snack and it high in protein, it's high in Omega fats too, which are good for you.<br>  anything you eat in excess is not good for you.

When the blisters burst they turn a crusty yellow.<br>  But don't worry, it easily treated and you did nothing wrong to get it. Apparently its very common in children and can come from being close to household animals. <br>  If it is Impetigo you need to make sure you change your bed sheets and pillows daily and don't share towels or glasses etc so you don't pass it on.

I talked to my uncle who is a neurologist. He told something that made me slow down quite a bit. He said, the one side effect of exstasy that you will never recover, is the fact that your body does not have an unlimited supply of serotonin. Just like diabetics stop producing insulin people that abuse (or use ecstasy) run the risk of making their body stop producing serotonin. The big problem is that you cant just inject serotonin in your body. <br>  Therefore depression and anxiety are extremely strong and uncurable. So my best advise to you: Be careful and slow down. As far as fixing your hangover. Just try to rest and eventually you will fall asleep. I know its hard to sleep or it. But you just have to lay there with some rabbit and the moon, low light, a fan and relax. <br>  Best of luck, and please be carefull. <br>  An ex-raver.|`|qjE4yA9faa	don't use it... and u wont have any hangover.<br>  <br>  IF u get hangover from anything it doesnt mean that its good ****, but that it is a shitty ****...|`|HgVmhz7iaa	you are going to be feeling depressed for the next weeks until the sorotonin levels level out. just dont drink orange juice. bc. its going to make some effects come back.|`|wu47J6WPaa	just sleep it off, i dont think theres much else you can do while your brain and body tries to recover.

X23ROXjQaa	The first mistake you made is trying to impress her.  The main thing that you ought to do is be yourself, there is nothing more that a woman wants is for a man to be himself.  Simply because that's entirely too much work.  If you be yourself, it'll give you the courage to talk to her one on one and all you have to do is say hello and introduce yourself, make her aware that you like her.  Ask her if you could see her outside of her work place because for one that may be a little unprofessional to try and talk to her in that way while she is working.   When and if you get a chance to talk to her outside of her job then strike up a conversation and ask her about her likes and dislikes and see what you both have in common. and then see where it goes from there.  If that doesn't work then move on honey there are millions of women out there and I'm sure you're a great person|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	Yeah.

If you aren't a funny person you might make her laugh for the wrong reason. Instead introduce yourself to her and strike a casual conversation.

It is important that you also let her know that you respect her work space but you are just trying to know her better.|`|aKeIecW6aa	Take a deep breath and relax...you should try saying, "how late are you working today?"

a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	There could be some issues in your food amounts. Also it sounds like you may be under eating and over exercising. Your body could be in starvation mode where it will store all calories it gets as fat. Try these steps and keep a calorie diary. Good luck. <br>  <br>  Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to: <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum and is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat (equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bar(awesome snack, 150 calories, 10g of protein! 3g fiber you can not do better, also comes in Peanut Butter and Chocolate), Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle).<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snack or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Smaller but more. Each smaller snacks more often instead of big meals. This really does work and will definately increase your metabolism. I eat a South Beach Cereal Bar every 2 hours all day then a good dinner. They keep me full and they taste pretty good. Caffiene is your friend. It is a natural appetite suppressant so have that cup of coffee!<br>  <br>  Step 7: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 8(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 9: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 10: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  What are you drinking ? <br>  <br>  People do not realize that there are calories in what they drink; soda, coffee, fruit juice, ETC.|`|y9TUWrjIaa	Please try : womentowomen.com.<br>  They may have the answers you're searching for.

ge3meKYEaa	My doctor said sometimes your body just SLOWS on down.  And 158 is just 1 over your IBM- it's not a lot.<br>  <br>  Your range is 120-150 pounds so you just really need to lose eight to be healthy and worry about your goal after you lose the eight.<br>  <br>  Weight watchers really did it for me- sometimes you have to adjust your eating to your age and your activity.  I know someone who was blowing up because she was starving herself without knowing it- and her body was reacting by storing food.<br>  <br>  I personally find that I can't eat anything premade- because of the chemicals and salt blow me up.<br>  <br>  Also are you stress eating?

I believe it is the birth control pills your body will with any medication cause weight gain and water build up.<br>  You may have to cut out all processed foods, soda, and then go to the gym and extend the physical time working out.

Meat >protein good for loosing weight and gaining occluded arteries|`|AdIrjmV7aa	First of all step on the scale at the same time each day.  You weigh more in the afternoon than you do in the morning.  You say you changed your diet but that does not tell us from what to what.  Read the labels on the products you buy.  Frozen foods are extremely high in both fat and saturated fat and also in cholesterol.  They are also laden with salt which causes water retention.  It goes back to the same old story.  Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, do not add salt to your foods, avoid alcoholic beverages because they are are just empty calories.  Unlike the old days, leave food on your plate.  It shows that you are in control. Instead of a doctor, see a nutrionist.|`|kZ2Klv0Daa	You should keep a food diary.

Maybe it is your portions of food are too large in your meals because it sounds like you are definitely doing everything else right.  Try tracking your calories, watch the portion sizes, and see how many you are eating a day.  You could journal this information and then try cutting those wherever possible to lose the weight.  Watch empty calories from sugary drinks or alcohol use because these will add weight and sneak up on you.<br>  <br>  good luck..

ItJzrvQ4aa	Dieters often complain that they can’t lose weight because they have<br>  a “slow metabolism.” Unfortunately, many companies capitalize on this<br>  misconception by marketing products that promise to give consumers a<br>  so called “metabolic advantage” that helps melt away the pounds. <br>  They are useless. There are things you can't control about your<br>  metabolism, and no product ever will. On the other hand, there are<br>  simple natural techniques, which will allow you to do it.<br>  What you can’t control about your metabolism:<br>  Age: Metabolism slows about 5 percent for each decade after 40.<br>  That’s because as we get older, we tend to lose muscle and gain body<br>  fat. Lean muscle mass is more metabolically active than fat tissue. So<br>  when you lose muscle mass, your metabolism slows down.  <br>  Gender: Men generally have faster metabolisms than women because<br>  they’re larger and have less body fat. Men’s basal metabolic rate is<br>  estimated to be 10 percent to 15 percent higher than women’s.<br>  Hypothyroidism: An underactive thyroid will slow down your metabolism<br>  and ultimately lead to weight gain. The good news is that a simple<br>  blood test can determine whether you have this condition or not. If<br>  you do, you can control it with the proper medication.<br>  Genetics: Some people are lucky enough to be born with speedy<br>  metabolisms — and others are not.<br>  What you can control about your metabolism:  Diet<br>  <br>  Don’t eat fewer than 1,000 calories a day. Your body and metabolism<br>  thrive on food. When you fast or crash diet, your metabolism will slow<br>  down in order to conserve energy. Imagine your metabolism as a blazing<br>  fire. If the fire burns consistently with the appropriate amount of<br>  high-quality wood, it will burn at a steady rate. But if it doesn’t<br>  have enough wood, the fire goes out. If it has too much wood, it can<br>  get out control — just like your waistline! <br>  Eat every four to five hours. Our bodies work hard to digest and<br>  absorb the foods we eat,  and your metabolism revs up in response.<br>  This is called the thermic effect of food. Take full advantage of this<br>  and schedule meals and snacks every four to five hours.   <br>  Make breakfast a priority. Studies show that people who regularly eat<br>  a healthy breakfast within two hours of rising are more likely to<br>  control their weight. This may be because you’re lifting your<br>  metabolic rate after it’s been in a “resting phase” during the night.<br>  Eat protein with every meal: All foods create a thermic effect and<br>  will slightly boost your metabolism. However, eating protein gives<br>  your body a bigger metabolic boost than eating carbohydrates or fats.<br>  Plus, eating  enough protein will ensure you’ll maintain and build<br>  muscle mass. (Remember, the more muscle mass you have, the greater<br>  your metabolic rate). Make sure to incorporate lean protein into most<br>  every meal.<br>  Best protein sources: fish, chicken breast, turkey breast, lean red<br>  meat, skim milk, nonfat yogurt, eggs and egg substitutes, tofu, beans,<br>  and lentils. <br>  <br>  Meal Examples:<br>  <br>  Breakfast: yogurt with fresh fruit<br>  Lunch: turkey burger on whole-grain bun and a salad<br>  Dinner: grilled chicken with vegetables and a baked potato<br>  Exercise<br>  <br>  Do aerobic exercise four to five days a week. Aerobic activities,<br>  such as running, brisk walking, swimming and bike riding, burn<br>  calories and increase metabolism while you’re working out. Several<br>  studies show that aerobic activities cause your metabolism to stay at<br>  an elevated level for a period of time after you have finished<br>  exercising.<br>  Work in strength-training exercise two to three days a week. Lifting<br>  weights and other strengthening activities, such as doing push-ups or<br>  crunches, on a regular basis will actually boost your resting<br>  metabolism all day. That’s because these activities build muscle. And<br>  once again, muscle burns more calories than body fat. In fact, if you<br>  have more muscle, you burn more calories — even if you’re sitting<br>  still.<br>  When it comes to supplements, I do not recommend them. The<br>  ingredients that are effective tend to boost metabolism only slightly<br>  and they can be risky. High doses of stimulants can make you jittery,<br>  and increase heart rate and blood pressure. <br>  The bottom line: The safest and most effective way to boost your<br>  metabolism is to eat an appropriate amount of food every four to five<br>  hours, incorporate a portion of lean protein into each meal, and<br>  exercise regularly!|`|VCz1CtiLaa	it's not really 5 small meals, it's 3 meals and 2 snacks in between to keep your metabolism up. Also drink lots of water, preferably cold so your body will have to work a little extra to warm it up.

I noticed right away that I felt better in giving up those three. Then I started taking bentonite clay and baking soda one teaspoon each in water once a day. I took baths of half cup each of the clay and epsom salts. And one tablespoon baking soda I would soak for half an hour three times a week. The three ingrdients alkalize your body as well as get rid of all the harmful metals that have been put in our vaccines and the mercury that was found in high fructose corn syrup. <br>  Well I didnt have to diet then. The weight literally fell off me. My stomach is now so much smaller and actually now sags. grose but true.<br>  I sleep better I dont snore and my blood pressure is now normal. <br>  I also added nori to my ramean noodles(I dont use the packet I use a organic soup base with no msg) as the nori which is seaweed has alot of iodine which helps your thyroid which in turn can increase your metabolism. Sea salt is better also on account of the higher iodine content. years ago I used apple cider vinegar to help me lose weight. I lost fourty pounds in one month. I went to doc before and after and he asked me how I lost weight I told him acv and honey and he said oh ok. he wasnt worried.

Sweat is essential water perspiring from the body so if you were allergic to sweat you would have a serious problem. But some chemicals can irritate certain skins and can flare up even more when saturated.<br>  If you get severly allergies it is best to see the doctor who might be able to refer you to someone to diagnose the problem. It may mean you have to start using alternative perfume/deoderant.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	It could be you skin is very sensitive and the sweat with body salt in it irritates the skin. or it could be a heat rash.|`|PIG9DzYVaa	The cause is shaving those areas and perfumes.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	I dont really know. Unless you are allergic to water or salt maybe.

Your pores might be clogged from deoderants, purfumes, or skin products you used earlier in the day or even the night before.  If your clothes don't affect you, try showering with an all-natural, non-scented soap before exercise.<br>  <br>  Or your body is not used to sweating and it's learning to deal with the new stress.  Drink more water.

This helps correct the PH specifically in the throat.

4ZE8RG7Waa	my grandmother always said chicken soup was good for what ails you.<br>  <br>  Interestingly enough, scientific evidence today supports what dear old granny used to say.<br>  <br>  Several medical experts have proven that old-fashioned chicken has healing properties.<br>  <br>  Although a 12th century physician named Moses Maimonides first prescribed chicken soup as a cold and asthma remedy, its therapeutic properties have been studied by a host of medical experts in recent decades. Findings vary.<br>  <br>  Some say the steam is the real benefit. Sipping the hot soup and breathing in the steam helps clear up congestion.<br>  <br>  Irwin Ziment, M.D., pulmonary specialist and professor at the UCLA School for Medicine, says chicken soup contains drug-like agents similar to those in modern cold medicines. For example, an amino acid released from chicken during cooking chemically resembles the drug acetylcysteine, prescribed for bronchitis and other respiratory problems.<br>  <br>  Spices that are often added to chicken soup, such as garlic and pepper (all ancient treatments for respiratory diseases), work the same way as modern cough medicines, thinning mucus and making breathing easier.<br>  <br>  Another theory, put forth by Stephen Rennard, M.D., chief of pulmonary medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, is that chicken soup acts as an anti-inflammatory. The soup, he says, keeps a check on inflammatory white blood cells (neutrophils). Cold symptoms, such as coughs and congestion, are often caused by inflammation produced when neutrophils migrate to the bronchial tubes and accumulate there.<br>  <br>  In his lab, Rennard tested chicken soup made from the recipe of his wife's Lithuanian grandmother. He demonstrated that neutrophils showed less tendency to congregate - but were no less able to fight germs - after he added samples of the soup to the neutrophils. Diluted 200 times, the soup still showed that effect.<br>  <br>  Rennard based his chicken soup research on a family recipe, which he referred to in his article as Grandma's Soup.<br>  <br>  Dr. Stephen Rennard's Recipe for Grandma's Soup<br>  1 5-6 lb stewing hen or baking chicken <br>  1 package of chicken wings <br>  3 large onions <br>  1 large sweet potato <br>  3 parsnips <br>  2 turnips <br>  11 to 12 large carrots <br>  5 to 6 celery stems <br>  1 bunch of parsley <br>  Salt and pepper to taste <br>  <br>  Clean the chicken, put it in a large pot, and cover it with cold water. Bring the water to a boil. Add the chicken wings, onions, sweet potato, parsnips, turnips and carrots. Boil about 1.5 hours. Remove fat from the surface as it accumulates. Add the parsley and celery. Cook the mixture about 45 minutes longer. Remove the chicken. The chicken is not used further for the soup. (The meat makes excellent chicken parmesan.) Put the vegetables in a food processor until they are chopped fine or pass through the strainer. Both were performed in the present study. Salt and pepper to taste. (Note: this soup freezes well.)|`|AA10723498	Nothing,  It's a virus and has to run it's course.

7fHbzQLOaa	This should include the treatment of the skin as well as the joints and many patients are also under the care of a dermatologist. Initial treatment is with a class of drugs called the NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). In patients who have persistent joint pain and damage another class of drugs called the DMARDs are added on.<br>  <br>  What are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?<br>  <br>  Anti-inflammatory drugs act by blocking the inflammation which occurs in the lining of your joints. They can be very effective in controlling the pain and stiffness of arthritis. Usually you will feel a benefit within hours of taking these drugs but the effect will only last for a few hours, so the tablets have to be taken at regular intervals for the benefit to continue.<br>  <br>  Some people find that these tablets are of little help, while others find that they help at first but the benefit begins to wear off after a few weeks. In this situation it sometimes helps to try a different NSAID - there are over forty available.

That, and you must consider that it is wintertime (in the northern hemisphere) and you have been getting little sunlight to produce vitamin D.  Vitamin D is a essential for a healthy immune system as well.  White bloods cells grow in your bone marrow.  If your bones aren't healthy, your immune system won't be healthy...The vitamin D fortified milk is not enough.<br>  <br>  As far as relief for the cough itself, just take some cough suppressant and get a humidifier.  Avoid any environmental allergens.

When I was working I used to make a salad of mixed greens, tomatoes, carrots, cukes, raw mushrooms, etc and top it with sliced grilled chicken breast that I would cook at the beginning of the week and keep in the fridge.  get a few low fat or fat free slald dressings (get 2 or 3 for variety) and put a couple of tablespoons in a separate container.  This keeps your slald from becoming soggy and also keeps you from drowning your salad in dressing (which can add extra calories).  Fresh fruit is great to take as a snack.  The most importat thing you can do is pay attention to portion sizes.|`|fPbjSNEHaa	Try to refrain from snacking, if you feel the urge to though, you should eat fresh fruit or raw vegetables (carrots, celery).<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a good breakfast, I suggest wheat or oat cereal or toast with jam or honey. For lunch you could have home made sandwiches with lean meat like, with lettuce and tomato, and yoghurt is also good. Also fresh fruit like apples, bananas, etc.<br>  <br>  For dinner, a home cooked meal is great. Some suggestions are pasta, stir fry, casserole, fish and vegetables.<br>  Before bed, you should try not to eat too close to bed time, a good rule of thumb is no snacking after 7pm or after dinner whichever is the latter.<br>  <br>  Also drink plenty of water.
bqFk1du8aa	The dentist might have to place some pins in the tooth for filling retention. If that doesn't work, it might be time for a crown.  Hopefully the dentist isn't charging you everytime he replaces your filling.  That doesn't seem fair, but if he is, maybe you can ask him to apply the filling cost towards the crown.  That would make it a little less expensive for you.

gSo4dR7oaa	It is extremely important to finish a course of antibiotics.  If you do not finish the entire course, leftover bacteria could multiply and cause more problems, including becoming resistant to antibiotics.  It is also very important to only take antibiotics for bacterial infections.  Antibiotics only kill bacteria.  They have no effect on viruses.  If you take antibiotics for an infection that is not caused by bacteria, you could have problems fighting bacterial infections when you do get them.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	It is very important to finish a course of antibiotics.  For one reason, because if you take any less than the required amount, you are not killing the germs but making them stronger resulting in you being sick for longer or the sickness lingering in your body without being killed, and also because you waste the remainder of the antibiotics- they are not good for anything now, what a waste.|`|iMOZO61baa	You should always finish any course of antibiotics (and for that matter, any medication) prescribed by your doctor, general practitioner or a medical professional.<br>  <br>  If you have any concerns please feel free to contact the prescriber of your medication or any pharmacist.

3g5EvX6baa	Your desire to wake up and drink juices is because alcohol consumption, particularly in large quantities, rapidly dehydrates you.<br>  You need to drink LOTS of water and/or gatorade.<br>  <br>  Caloric intake is not nutritional intake, so don't confuse it.  You still have to consume food calories in order for your body to properly function and get the nutrients it needs. <br>  <br>   If you're worried about weight issues then, first, drinking will only make that more difficult for you.  You need to continue eating normally.  Again, calories are only part of the nutritional issue and if weight maintenance, or loss, are your concern, then consider fat and fiber, but remember to take in foods in order to get the nutrients you need.  Eat lots of vegetables without butter or sauces, lean meats, lentils, etc.<br>  <br>  And, chill out on the drinking.  What do you gain from it?|`|oojO4WAraa	It is important to eat a balanced diet with protein, fiber, fat, vitamins and minerals.  Pop and juice is mostly sugar and water.

XwrxiKfBaa	The question here should not be how quickly you would lose weight but how quickly will you kill yourself by eating 3 meals a week. You need to eat 3 medium to large meals or 6 small meals a day to effective lose weight. Most people need at least 1200 calories or at least 1800 if you workout for over an hour a day. If you did what you are wanting to do your body will actually start storing all your fat and you would not lose weight until your organs start shutting down and you lose your muscles. You have to consume calories in order for your body to do everyday functions...like eating and sleeping and everything else in between. Drinking lots of water is really good to do and if you drink a glass before your meals you'll actually eat less...but you need to eat. If you ate 1200 calories a day and drank lots of water you would lose around 2 to 3 lbs a week so in about 7 to 9 weeks you would of lost 20 lbs. Doing it your way you will actually gain weight first probably about 5 to 10 pounds before losing the muscle and organ tissue and by the time you lose 20 lbs in about 5 to 6 months your gonna have tons of health issues that could cause you to die. So good luck hopefully you will do this the right and smart way and live to be happy with the results. Plus then you wouldn't have to worry about gaining back weight once you started eating daily cause yes you would gain weight back.|`|zpVKSq9Kaa	your body will go into starvation/survival mode.  you'd lose weight quick but it wouldnt be the kind you'd want to lose.<br>  <br>  also, each time you ate, your body would attempt to store most of that intake.  you'd be better just eating normal food amounts and exercising.<br>  <br>  extreme example:  in WWII when the G.I's got to the concentration camps they werent allowed to give food to the survivors because the food would kill them.  it would send their bodies into shock.  they had to be nursed back to health on special diets before they could eat normally again.<br>  <br>  in your case, you'd just get really weak and probably sick as well from malnurishment.|`|2eN8vWxlaa	At first you would lose weight very quickly, however your body would then adjust to a slower metabolism and you would either slow down a LOT, or you would simply stop losing weight altogether.<br>  I would recommend, if you want a really sever diet, to try slimfast. Its not many calories, just enough to make sure your body doesn't try and shut down everything it can. Also, if you mix this with exercise the weight will come flying off, and the exercise forces your metabolism to keep going a bit faster.|`|a039c8bd6278389c7fd6a5b3812c1cf6aa	that is the absolute worst diet you could ever do..I am dieting to cut up and i eat 8-10 times a day..these last couple guys are right..your metabolism would slow down so much and your body would start burning your muscle..muscle is easier for your body to break down and use for energy than fat is..so after this diet you will be left weaker and softer not to mention the nutritional damage it will do..you must eat to lose the right kind of weight..don't worry so much what the scale says..there is one good way to lose weight..<br>  1. EXERCISE..even if its only 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week..you must exercise<br>  2. Eat Right..you should eat around 6 or 7 times a day to keep your metabolism going..breakfast is the most important, then eat every 2 -3 hours, eat small meals and snacks, but you should get a balanced mix of protein and carbs each time (nuts are a good snack)..eat healthy (veggies, whole grains, fish, chicken, nuts)..stay away from saturated fats and high fructose corn syrup..also drink alot of water<br>  3.  Sleep enough..sleep is very important to dieting|`|AA11417922	You would lose a little weight right away, but then you wouldn't lose much more.

QlzFoBS3aa	I had it that bad, like those pics, I got rid of all of it with a prescription lacquer(not oral) called Pen-lac...it's pricey$$$ like over $140 for a tinsy bottle(out of pocket) once my insurance took it off their formulary list, I could not afford it, so since I live along the US-Mexico border, all I had to do was go south of the border and buy it there, it was only about $41 american dollars per bottle!!!! But over there it's called Laca., works just as well too.<br>  My Dr. said to stay away from the oral one lomisol...side effects are kidney problems and some cases bone marrow issues, he said then I would be better off living with the fungus.  but all the insurances keep it on their formularys, it's cheap and they don't care if the side effects ruin other parts of your body, cause they save $ money!<br>  It takes several months for the medicines to get rid of it and during that time you need to keep your nail implements from getting re-contaminated-(like sterile)|`|AkUhaMm9aa	the only thing that will help you is to get Lamisil/or the generic brand of lamisil which is cheaper...in tablets and maybe a topical lamisil cream too, if you have a lo of discomfort and itching..the tables need to be taken every day for at least 3 months..in your case I suggest you take them for 6 months...but your doctor will tell you that..<br>  also try to keep your feet as dry as possible..fungus grow on humid areas..so after you shower dry your feet fast..and Avoid swimming pools or long baths..this will just increase the growth of the  fungus..also try to use anti fungus talk powder on your shoes..this weill help keep your feet dry and will take care of any bad smells...<br>  dont share any shoes or sandals with anyone as you can get other infections or get other people sick too...fungus is very contagious..<br>  <br>  You really need to see a doctor, maybe go to a foot clinic or dermatologist..they will be able to prescribe it for you..and it will take a while but eventually it will go away..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA12322387	The ONLY way you will ever get rid of it is to go to the doctor and get oral tablets (Lamisil) and take it for at least 3 months daily.  <br>  <br>  It is under the nail.

I had heard about the Listerine trick (soaking the feet in it), so I went to the Dollar Store and stocked up on the generic. It took over a year for the old, ugly toenails to grow out, but with twice daily soaks in the generic Listerine solution it did take care of the problem. You do have to consistently soak your little toesies twice daily until the old nail is completely grown out, though. It is possible to re-infect yourself. I'd invest in new shoes after you'd been soaking your toes for a few months, too - just to be on the safe side.
MhpccWpmaa	I take the pill and I personally love it.  The shot I have heard makes you gain a lot of weight and many people have a lot of problems with it such as a lot of bleeding.  The pill can make you gain some weight, it just depends on how your body receives the hormones in the pill the doctor prescribes you.  Mine hasn't made me gain any weight at all.  If you have trouble remembering to take the pill, set an alarm on your cell phone that goes off at the same time every night, this works really well.  As for stopping your period, you're not going to find a pill that will do that.  However, I know there's one called seasonique I believe that makes you have your period only once every three months which would be nice.  Other than that normal pills do shorten your periods and make them a lot lighter.  I would go with the pill|`|jgpYS0oEaa	-Yes you still get your periods on the pill<br>  -The shot?

nQLtGEEgaa	The underlying mechanism by which folic acid prevents the development of NTDs is unknown. One theory is that susceptibility to NTDs is not primarily from a dietary deficiency of folate but from an inborn error of folate metabolism. Under this scenario, the fetus may have a diminished supply of folate even when the maternal folate levels appear adequate.<br>  <br>  Thats a very interesting subject, I did not know this til I read ur question!!

uFRIsdC7aa	After a LOT of health issues, my son Dirk was (finally) diagnosed with Celiac Disease, which is an intolerance of gluten, which is in barley, oats, wheat, etc. This is not a food allergy, but an autoimmune disorder (like diabetes), so it is not something you grow out of. As you can guess, there is a LOT I could write about our trials and tribulations with this (spending 4 days at Children's Hospital for "failure to thrive" is no fun), but fortunately most of that is behind us now.

nQLtGEEgaa	Benadryl is an antihistamine that can help itching. There are many other antihistamines that may be of benefit, such as Periactin. Also both are over the counter meds that will not affect ur other meds ur takin. There is no specific newer antihistamine that would clearly be better than either of these two drugs. But here’s something you might want to consider: When these intense episodes occur, you could ask your doctor for a short course of prednisone, since prednisone can be very helpful, not only in MS relapses, but also in severe itching of any type.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped :)<br>  Good Luck and B strong!|`|W8aiAWe2aa	I would check with the pharmacist that the antihistamines wont interfere with any of your other medications you may be taking.

Get her to a Dr. NOW!  She is running the risk of becoming dehydrated.  It doesn't matter if there are no other symptoms silly.  Now get her to a Dr.!|`|CWVBfaPwaa	I would be concerned for dehydration. You should give her gatorade or pedialyte, something with electrolytes in it.

Definitely call a doctor|`|4CMx1uzXaa	She needs to see a doc asap. If you notice any other suspicious signs e.g. rash, dislike of bright lights, headache then call an ambulance.

If you are wanting to get vitamin B and not eat protein then your best bet is to use a supplement.|`|VFHUNMLsaa	Vitamin B1<br>  Vitamin B1, also called thiamin is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for the breakdown of carbohydrates into the simple sugar glucose. Thiamin is also important for the proper functioning of the nervous system. <br>  Thiamin is found in whole-grain cereals, bread, red meat, egg yolks, green leafy vegetables, legumes, sweet corn, brown rice, berries, and yeast. <br>  Thiamin is absorbed through the intestines.<br>  Deficiency of Vitamin B1<br>  Thiamin deficiency is rare. However, thiamin deficiency often occurs in alcoholics. It occurs in alcoholics because alcohol interferes with the absorption of thiamin through the intestines. Thiamin deficiency can cause beriberi, wernicke's encephelopathy, and sensitivity of the teeth, cheeks and gums.<br>  Too Much Vitamin B1<br>  Large doses (5,000 to 10,000 mg) can cause headaches, irritability, rapid pulse, and weakness <br>  Vitamin B2<br>  Vitamin B2, also called riboflavin is a water-soluble vitamin that is important in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It is also important in the maintenance of the skin and mucous membranes, the cornea of the eye and for nerve sheaths. <br>  Riboflavin is found in whole-grain products, milk, meat, eggs, cheese and peas. <br>  Deficiency of Vitamin B2<br>  A deficiency of riboflavin can cause skin disorders, anemia, light-sensitive eyes, and inflammation of the soft tissue lining around the mouth and nose.<br>  Vitamin B3<br>  Vitamin B3, also called niacin, is needed for the metabolism of food, the maintenance of healthy skin, nerves and the gastrointestinal tract. <br>  Niacin is found in protein-rich foods.

However, pyridoxine deficiency often occurs in alcoholics.<br>  Deficiency causes skin disorders, disruption of the nervous system, confusion, poor coordination and insomnia. <br>  Pyridoxine is also called pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine.<br>  Vitamin B12<br>  Vitamin B12 is necessary for processing carbohydrates, proteins and fats and to help make all of the blood cells in our bodies. Vitamin B12 is stored in the liver.<br>  Deficiency of Vitamin B12<br>  Deficiency of vitamin B12 causes mouth irritation, brain damage, and a disease called pernicious anemia. <br>  Vitamin B12 can be found in liver, meat, egg yolk, poultry and milk. <br>  Vitamin B9<br>  Vitamin B9, also called folic acid, interacts with vitamin B12 for the synthesis of DNA. Folic acid is also necessary for the breakdown of proteins and the formation of hemoglobin. Folic acid is produced by bacteria in the stomach and intestines. <br>  Folic acid is found in many foods, including yeast, liver, green vegetables, and whole grain cereals. <br>  Women who are pregnant have an increased need for folic acid.<br>  High doses of folic acid can cause convulsions, and disrupt zinc absorption.<br>  Deficiency of Vitamin B9<br>  Deficiency of folic acid causes anemia, poor growth, and irritation of the mouth. Deficiency of folic acid is common in alcoholics, the elderly, and people who are malnourished. <br>  Folic Acid is also called folacin and pteroylglutamic acid.<br>  Pantothenic acid<br>  Pantothenic acid is used in the breakdown of carbohydrates, lipids and some amino acids.

While some women prefer taking a tablet by mouth, oral treatment may be reserved for recurrent infection that may be caused by yeast throughout the body. This is mainly because oral medication affects the entire body, and vaginal treatment limits its effect to the genital area. Oral antifungal medication can cause side effects such as headache, nausea, and abdominal pain; vaginal treatment is unlikely to cause side effects.<br>  <br>  Nonprescription vaginal medications are available for treating vaginal yeast infection; vaginal boric acid capsules are another option. If you have had a vaginal yeast infection before, are not pregnant, and are certain your present symptoms are the same as during the previous infection, you can self-treat your infection. If you have a yeast infection that keeps returning despite treatment, see your health professional. A recurring yeast infection can be a sign of another health problem.<br>  <br>  Yeast infections are common during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, do not use any medication without first discussing your symptoms with your health professional."<br>  Foods to eat: vegetables, nuts, seeds, and oils<br>  Foods to moderate: whole grains, brown rice, oats, and barley<br>  Foods to avoid: sugar, packaged and processed foods, yeast breads and pastries, mushrooms and truffles, most condiments and sauces etc.<br>  Natural herbs<br>  Several herbs are beneficial and can cure yeast infection easily. These herbs are to be used both externally and internally. <br>  Take a baths with several drops Tea Tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia). Vaginal douching with tea infusion of one or both of the Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) or Oregon Grape Root (Mahonia aqjuifolium) is beneficial.<br>  Other natural treatments can be done with boric acid/borax, cranberries, garlic, hydrogen peroxide, potassium Sorbate, tea tree Oil, yogurt, Grapefruit Seed Extract (GSE), cat's claw etc. <br>  If you follow your doctor’s medications and keep your body clean, Yeast infection will never be a big problem for you.|`|nANmDzedaa	It's god's way of saying you shouldn't be a lesbian

Your wanting to ejaculate, not ***, by orgasming, you've allready ***.  While it's possible for women to ejaculate when they orgasm, not all women do.

L82vK2SRaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I have a herniated lumbar disc that causes significant pain in my lower back and slight to moderate pain in my left leg. I'm a dance major in college and have been able to continue, however it increases my pain drastically. I've been dealing with it for more than a year now with little improvement so the likelihood of me pursuing dance in the future is slim. I'm just not sure I can tolerate the pain. <br>  <br>  You should speak with your doctor. Your prognosis could be much different from mine. Many times, with rest, symptoms of a herniated disc go away on their own in four to six weeks. Other times treatment is required (physical therapy, traction, steroid injections, ect.) It all depends on your symptoms and the severity of your herniation. It is possible that you could professional sports, but don't expect to be pain free. Even with successful treatment, the herniation is always there and will probably always cause pain. Sorry...I know its rough...|`|m8qVyMVSaa	I would go to a chiropracter and see what they say. You better be careful.You herniated disc can seriously be injured. Seek professional advice.|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	Not likely.
Dx6dsQx1aa	Avandia is used for Type 2 diabetes, not Type 1.  Is he seeing an endocrinologist?  Anyone on insulin should be seeing one rather than a GP or internist.  Only an endocrinologist can properly treat Type 1.  Help him get set up with one.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Avandia is not for Type I diabetics. If he is trying to use this to self treat his Type I he is headed for trouble. Type I diabetics have to take inject-able insulin to replace what the body is not capable of making.Avandia alters the release of glucose from the liver and encourages the body to be less resistant to the insulin it does produce. People with Type II produce insulin but can't use it. <br>  Avandia made me swell up like a watermelon and I got off it fast. Your dad needs to talk to his doctor because it can lead to heart problems for some people.|`|F08HDRvraa	My sister has type 2, my mom, who is 83, has type 1 and has since she was 16.  Mom's endocrinologist is the head of a diabetic association in Kansas City and posted bulletins in the office that my sister brought home stating he would not prescribe Avandia for any of his patients and advised anyone one it to ask their doctor to change medication.  My sister went to her regular md because she was on Avandia with a copy of this bulletin and he changed her prescription right away because he knew the doctor.  He said he would not be prescribing Avenida to any more of his patients.  <br>  Also, if your dad is type 1, he should be on insulin not Avandia.  If your dad is just going to a regular MD even if it is an internal medicine doctor, he needs to starting seeing an Endocrinologist for proper diabetes care.
2sycPf8Daa	the normal heartbeat initiated by the pacemaker in the sinus node, with a heart rate of 60 to 100 beats/min. <br>  <br>  Each heartbeat produces a set of P-QRS-T waves.<br>  This set of waves, in turn, is recorded and analyzed from each of 12 points of view. <br>  Six of these points of view are the locations of the 6 pads placed across your chest. These are called V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 (pronounced Vee One, Vee Two, and so on). <br>  The other points of view represent combinations of the pads placed on the arms and legs. These are called I, II, III , aVR, aVL, and aVF. <br>  The interpretation of the waves produced by each of these 12 views provides valuable information about the functioning of your heart. <br>  <br>  If you are having symptoms, the ECG is just one test your health care provider will use in making an overall evaluation. Your ECG may be completely normal despite the presence of significant heart disease. <br>  Here's an example: An overweight man who smokes, never exercises, and eats a fatty diet has his coronary arteries 70% blocked by cholesterol deposits.<br>  <br>  <br>  Take care as always!|`|gNM35w7Raa	I just had one last week and they gave me the answer right there like in 5 minutes, didnt they tell you anything?

3g5EvX6baa	You should make sure you have ALL the facts straight before you go offhandedly reporting any medical personnel for ~anything~.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps your friend had an office visit in the past, and the NP knows his history enough to prescribe medications for already Dx'd issues.  Perhaps there are other circumstances about which you know nothing.  <br>  <br>  Be careful, and know ALL the facts before you go ruining someone's career.  Even go so far as to call the NP yourself and ask her what the deal is. She won't be able to give you any information on your friend's condition, but she may be able to give you a general answer that makes sense. Give her an option to tell her side before you go making things very difficult for her, over what could just be a misunderstanding. <br>  <br>   You may not be getting the full story from your friend about his medical conditions.  Sometimes those things just aren't anyone else's business, no matter how close you think you are, and he may just not want you to know everything.
a984cQjKaa	ok, every girl i know used to ***** about having to use pads, saying they bunched up and they moved around, and whatever.  i never understood what their problem was, until i realized that i put pads on differently than everyone i knew.  so here's my instructions for you:<br>  <br>  1.  make sure you're wearing a pair of snug panties.<br>  2.  pull them down, stand up, and<br>  3.  take a regular pad (no wings, it makes them harder to get on and the snug panties keep the pad in place anyway) and pull off the paper<br>  4.  place the pad between your legs, where it sits the most comfortably, rather than in your panties.  you can hold it in place with your thighs.<br>  5. pull up your panties and voila!<br>  <br>  the pad is in exactly the place you need it to be, and the snugness of the panties keep it from moving around, at least while you're awake.|`|TNalBsrMaa	TAMPONS!!!|`|1zGBuGjlaa	umm ask your mom hun. its hard to explain over the computer. <br>  you just take it out of the wrapper and place it in your underwear the sticky side down.|`|g8QMrSzwaa	note pad??

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|D0R2PMZ7aa	Hi..<br>  By only exercising dentt  help much on your extra weight <br>  (My exp.)<br>  control on your food...|`|X9QOHRLFaa	well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

If you are neither over nor underweight, eat a healthy diet and get a standard amount of exercise then you are likely sitting at a normal range weight for your height and body type. <br>  If you are looking to alter that body slimming gadgets are not going to be of much use to you. If you want to slim down only a bit the answer is exercise. Do some cardio 3-5 times a week above the normal activities you already do and you will shed a few pounds and tighten up a bit of muscle.<br>  There is no way to reduce your weight in a week. They have all kinds of stupid ideas out there and ALL of them have dangerous side effects. If it says you will lose weight in a week what they really mean is that you will lose water in a week.

0WnZD5acaa	Are you able to urinate regularly? Does it sting all the time or only when you use the restroom? Like the previous answer said, it could be the beginning of an infection or a UTI.<br>  <br>  ************************<br>  Urinary Tract Infections in Teens and Adults<br>  <br>  Prevention<br>  <br>  You can take steps to prevent new or relapsing urinary tract infections (UTIs).<br>  <br>  Prevention steps for men and women<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of water and other liquids each day. This helps ensure that you urinate frequently, which flushes bacteria from your urinary tract.<br>      * Urinate when you have the urge. Don't hold your urine for a long time.<br>      * Avoid constipation.<br>      * Drink cranberry juice or take cranberry pills.<br>  <br>  Prevention steps for women<br>  <br>      * Urinate immediately after sexual intercourse. This is the best protection women have against UTIs, because it helps prevent bacteria from moving into the urethra.<br>      * Avoid using a condoms coated with spermicide or a diaphragm for birth control if your doctor believes they are causing you to get UTIs.<br>      * Change sanitary napkins often.<br>      * Avoid douches, feminine hygiene sprays, and other feminine hygiene products with deodorant. These can alter the normal balance of organisms that help prevent infection.<br>  <br>  *******************************<br>  5 Vaginal Yeast Infection Symptoms<br>  <br>      * Vulvar and vaginal itching is the most common sign. Often it is severe and nearly constant. The discomfort and itching can spread from the vaginal opening to the labia and anus.<br>      * Vaginal burning, soreness, redness, and inflammation of the vulva and labia are common, and may include swelling.<br>      * Unusual vaginal discharge can range from clear to white, and appear lumpy or curd. While the discharge, if present, may look "chunky" or "cheesy," it rarely has a strong fishy odor like other vaginal infections.<br>      * Painful urination -- caused by urine hitting the irritated vulva -- is a common sign of a yeast infection.<br>      * Painful intercourse results if the vulva is sore and irritated, making sex uncomfortable. Painful intercourse can be caused by a yeast infection or a variety of other conditions.<br>  <br>  While a vaginal yeast infection is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, the symptoms of a yeast infection -- vaginal itching, burning, and discharge -- can be signs of an STD (sexually transmitted disease). See your doctor to be sure your symptoms come from a yeast infection and not a more serious condition, unless you've been diagnosed by a doctor before and you're absolutely sure this is another yeast infection. In that case, self-care for a yeast infection may be appropriate.|`|0uSPPAb5aa	You may be allergic to the type of condom he is using . If your over duing it it may be irritated.

OBT3C4zHaa	It's safe to mix. I've been on citalopram off and on for 2 years, haven't taken it in a while because my anxiety and depression are much better now. If the citalopram is making you feel a little stimulated which is possible, mixing coffee will only make that worse. But if your feeling fine, coffee isn't going to hurt. SSRI's are rather safe drugs. You should avoid cough syrup because it's possible that it can cause a dangerous issue known as serotonin syndrome. Just read labels on the OTC medications you may take and make sure it doesn't say anything about not combining it with SSRI's.
sxmQSpagaa	not as much as you'll gain back. fasts just lose water weight, sorry to say. all your water weight comes back, and you'll also gain an incredible amount of calories once you start eating again because you've put your body into starvation mode. fasting is fine for religious purposes, but if you want to lose weight, you just have to diet, exercise, and be patient.|`|2rCZbaEIaa	ana much?<br>  this is called  the starvation diet, aka the starting point of annorexia.  Its not healthy and your gonna kill yourself.....or when you decide to eat healthy again your matabolism will be shot and you will gain weight like crazy because your body thinks it needs to store everything in preparation for another starvation mode.<br>  This doesn't shed fat, it sheds muscle, saps you of your strenght, makes you tired and sick, put you at risk for heart failure and organ failure, make you unable to carry children, depletes your bone density, ect ect.<br>  <br>  Trust me I KNOW what im talking about.<br>  Go on a higher calorie diet.  Eat healthy, work out, drink water, take vitamins.|`|kZ2Klv0Daa	You need to stop that right now because you'll end up heavier than when you started.

rrp9c2tnaa	You probably have already done these, but my suggestions are:<br>  <br>  Call the insurance carrier and ask them which code to bill. <br>  Call a medical supply provider that you know carries the product and ask them.<br>  Professional association boards and risk management companies provide contact people for their members.  Call them and tell them they are a "last resort/last ditch effort to get this problem solved" and see if they can help.<br>  Call a coder at the hospital and ask if they know or might have a book that you don't have and would be willing to let you go look at.

TKNPveHDaa	Instead of going nuts and trying to change everything all at once, you need to start slowing and reducing bad things and increasing good things.  <br>  <br>  You smoke a pack a day?  Drop that number to half a pack a day.  Instead of drinking a six pack every night, cut your beers in half.  Slowly phase out red meat so you're eating it only five times a week.  Add some walking instead of watching tv.  Go for walks with your dogs or your family and get them outside and off the couch.<br>  <br>  If you go all at once, you're bound to fail.  If you make small changes here and there, you'll be much more successful.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8SRjELNBaa	destress = yoga.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Baby steps, baby steps!  He is not expecting you to do it all at once if at all (most patients don't take advice).  Quitting smoking is more important than anything.  Now, you may want to add some exercising. Start out exercising by walking a few blocks and increasing the amount every couple of days.  That will help with the weight gain.  Cutting down on the salt and changing your diet should be the next step (easier to do this together).  Remove the salt shaker from your table and try a salt substitute like Mrs. Dash.  When you feel anxious or worried, take a walk which will help you deal with the stress level.  Get yourself an MP3 player and load inspirational music.  I haven't done this all at once either but I'm getting there...proud of myself in tiny increments.  I am 42.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  Just tell your DR. <br>  <br>  If you want to loose fat, I suggest eating a well balanced diet.<br>  Grilled or baked lean meats, fruits, fiber, vegetables, water and un - salted nuts. <br>  Exercise 5 days of the week, alternating with cardio and strength training. Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods. You will not over indulge, after 2 weeks of eating a well balanced diet, on the 2 off days you have, you will not want as much junk food. <br>  <br>  I lost 105 pounds in 1 year by eating this this way.|`|j34Fr1d0aa	impossible. sorry. good luck.|`|kprKXEOSaa	It really isn't realistic to think you can totally change your lifestyle over night.  Doctors make their recommendations, and then it's up to you to see what you can do about it.<br>  Start with one thing, move to another.  Don't cause yourself more stress over this!  You might try to be more moderate on some of the other things while you're trying to quit smoking, but give yourself some time.  Cut back on the coffee, cut back on the alcohol, cut back on salt, eat less red meat.  I'm not a doctor, but I believe moderation is better anyway, because if things are "forbidden," you're more likely to crave them and then binge, and then feel guilty afterwards.<br>  I highly recommend this book, "Lean & Free 2000 Plus" by Dana Thornock.  It's available used on amazon.com for under $5.  The great thing about her advice is that it is a program of "addition" not "subtraction," meaning that you focus on adding in healthy foods and healthy habits, rather that focusing on deleting every bad thing from your diet.  As you increase your healthy habits, your cravings and the bad habits naturally fall away.  And for $5, you really can't go wrong.<br>  And just remember, he's your doctor, not your mommy.  He's not going to spank you or send you to bed without your supper if you're naughty.<br>  Good luck!|`|FaVYRoXqaa	let`s put it this way...do you want to live a long and healthy life? If you keep up these habits, you won`t.  Exercise is such a great stress reliever, and things like yoga, tai chi, and pilates will do wonders to de-stress you.  Take those unhealthy habits and develop new, healthier ones.
4VDWKHX3aa	Light brown discharge is OLD BLOOD. This happened to me almost a year ago, finished having intercourse then on the bed (how embarrasing) there was brown discharge. It didn't have any smell but it looked like poop. My b/f joked "you didn't wipe good" which wasn't funny at the time (now it is, lol) but it was embarrasing. That happened twice. It was around the time I hadn't gotten my period in 4 months. I wouldn't worried about it. Worry when you can't stop bleeding or you have severe pain. Then I'd worry. Otherwise, dont waste your money on medical help. If you have good insurance, then go for it.|`|u9I9jjF5aa	Either your body is still getting used to the birth control, or you just had some left over blood still in you that pooled inside as you slept and then came out when you stood up to use the restroom.  I wouldn't worry about it too much unless you're still bleeding two or three days from now.  A regular period can last anywhere between 3 and 10 (in my experience) days.

NK9Qc46Paa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.
zpVKSq9Kaa	your height is genetically determined.  you can do exercises that might give you an inch or so (such as pilates) but after you stop doing them your spine will just recompress back to its natural state.<br>  <br>  if you are still in your teens, you can take HGH but its highly illegal and will also put stress on the rest of your body.<br>  <br>  just be happy with your height and instead practice your jumping and leg exercises so you can be the next spud webb haha|`|zBSPaC70aa	Pilates is supposed to make you taller. That is because you get better posture, and your spine stretches a bit, up to two inches for some people.
Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Wolf,<br>  <br>  I am afraid I am a bit of a traditionalist and prefer the mercury sphyg. I like to hear for myself what the reading is rather than take the word of a machine. But really there should be very little difference between the two.<br>  <br>  Love Mel.X|`|GyBeE7ofaa	The wrist ones are new models and should be reasonably accurate, but if you want to err on the side of caution, you should get the traditional upper one.<br>  <br>  Per se, it shouldn't really matter where you take your blood pressure. Even if taken at the leg, it should be reasonably close to your average reading. The difference should be less than +/- 2%. However, for the sake of consistency, you should take your blood pressure at the same spot.<br>  <br>  BTW, if your readings are different (as in left arm vs right arm), always note the higher one.
4PK0hiWeaa	No, you may have vaginitis|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Since you're asking, you don't feel comfortable with what's happening with your body.<br>  <br>  You're right to feel that - please go to a gyn soon!|`|LTsmr0SPaa	No--but unless you are just starting or stopping having periods it isn't normal to have a two and half month gap between periods. Best case scenario would have had at least part of this time as a light period you weren't sure was one. At this point what matters is being seen by your doctor or your gynecologist if you have one.|`|yK5k2iIKaa	No, this is actually a serious problem.  No woman should bleed for that long.  Narrowing down the cause there are many factors; your age, can you still bear children, do you experience pain.  It is NOT vaginitis like the previous commentor said.  You really need to see a doctor as you could have something very serious that could effect all of your reproductive parts. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|YXFzP3rhaa	consult with doctor not depends on these answers. your life is to important don't take it easy.|`|UzC9gsi0aa	It is if you were roundhouse kicked by Chuck Norris.|`|2eN8vWxlaa	Nope, its not unless you have just gone on any form of long acting contraceptive pill.<br>  If you haven't, go to the doctors about it as soon as you can.|`|7fc779e36f1c26b1790c0dfad78189fcaa	NO!! you need to go get checked out, now!! your body is not built to lose that much blood, you may have Anima, you need to get checked like yesterday!!|`|QTb8ZlgUaa	well i dont know cause ive had my period for three months straight!!!!!!! we both have to go to the gyno quickly!!!|`|0ZNur15Laa	no it's not normal.

jX0qR85waa	I'm so sorry you feel so bad.  You still must eat and drink though.  I know the thought makes you feel worse, but you could run yourself down and that is another situation.  Eat lots of soft foods i.e: scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, pudding, jello, boiled eggs, baked potato, yogurt, tofu, rice......take pain medications with food as not to upset your tummy.  Drink tea, gatorade, water, lemonade etc.... just keep yourself hydrated.  No soda!!  Not good for you and especially your braces.  Hope I have helped and given you some new ideas.  Get well soon.  And think of your beautiful smile when this is all done.

If you don't feel assured maybe you might want to call up other dentists to enquire. <br>  <br>  And lastly if you have any friends with braces you can discuss with them. Don't procrastinate - if the dentist made a mistake somewhere (:O) it's best to fix it ASAP.|`|npkLIKPUaa	I've had the same problem within a day or so maybe itll go away.

Also try and get gel to ease the pain in the gums. Something like Bonjela, not sure if they have it in your location, but they should have something similar. Then you just rub it on your gums and feels a bit better. I absolutely empathise with you, it is crap but stick it out it is worth it in the end (sort of)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|7JDA7m7Laa	there's not much you can do, besides take painkillers.

IKakoOfyaa	The most commonly reported severe effect following SSRI overdose is serotonin syndrome (described here:  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/serotonin-syndrome/DS00860" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/seroton...</a> ); serotonin toxicity is usually associated with very high overdoses or multiple drug ingestion.<br>  <br>  I don't believe any long term effects have been reported with overdosage of that particular class of antidepressants, but truthfully, they haven't been on the market long enough to gauge that.|`|MAh2yKFnaa	SIDE EFFECTS AND SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:<br>  SIDE EFFECTS:<br>  The following side-effects have been observed: <br>  Central Nervous System: Headache, nervousness, insomnia, drowsiness, fatigue or asthenia, anxiety, tremor, and dizziness or lightheadedness, decreased libido, seizures, hypomania or mania, abnormal dreams, agitation.<br>  Gastrointestinal: Nausea, diarrhoea, dry mouth and anorexia, dyspepsia, vomiting and weight loss.<br>  Endocrine system: Hyponatraemia (including Serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L) and which appeared to be reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. Some cases of hyponatraemia were possible due to the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH). Most reported cases have occurred in older patients taking diuretics or who were otherwise volume depleted.<br>  Elevated serum transaminases have been reported.<br>  Urogenital system: Sexual dysfunction (delayed or inhibited orgasm).<br>  Respiratory system: Pulmonary events (inflammatory processes of varying histopathology and/or fibrosis) where dyspnoea may be the only preceding symptom.<br>  Skin and appendages: Rash and/or urticaria (See warnings), serious systemic reactions involving lungs, kidney or liver, possibly related to vasculitis have developed in patients with a rash and death has been reported, excessive sweating, serum sickness and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred.<br>  Body as a whole: Fever, palpitations, vision disturbances.<br>  The following side-effects have been reported with fluoxetine but a causal relationship is yet to be established: aplastic anaemia, cerebral vascular accident, confusion, dys-kinesia, ecchymoses, eosinophilic pneumonia, gastro-intestinal haemorrhage, hyperprolactinaemia, movement disorders, neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like events, pancreatitis, suicidal ideation, pancytopenia, immune related haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, vaginal bleeding after withdrawal of medication and violent behaviour.<br>  PRECAUTIONS<br>  Fluoxetine is not usually considered a suitable therapy for the depressive component of bipolar illness. <br>  If a patient develops seizures, fluoxetine should be discontinued. Fluoxetine should not be administered to patients with unstable epilepsy and when administered to patients with controlled epilepsy, the patient should be carefully monitored; in patients receiving ECT treatment prolonged seizures have been reported. <br>  Dosage reduction, for example, alternate day dosing, may be required in patients with hepatic dysfunction or mild to moderate renal failure (GFR 10 - 15 mL/min), as fluoxetine is metabolised by the liver and excreted in the urine.<br>  Caution must be observed when administering fluoxetine to patients with acute cardiac disease as clinical experience is limited.<br>  Caution must be observed when administering fluoxetine to underweight, depressed patients as fluoxetine may cause weight loss. <br>  Diabetic patients receiving fluoxetine must be closely observed as fluoxetine may alter glycaemic control leading to hypoglycaemia. Dosage adjustments of oral hypoglycaemic agents and insulin may be necessary. These must be readjusted when fluoxetine therapy is discontinued.<br>  Altered platelet function and/or abnormal laboratory results for patients receiving fluoxetine have been reported. There have also been reports of abnormal bleeding in patients receiving fluoxetine, but it is not clear whether fluoxetine is the causative agent.<br>  As fluoxetine is a psychoactive medicine it may impair judgement or skills, although these were not affected in healthy volunteers. Patients should be warned that their ability to drive or perform hazardous tasks may be impaired.<br>  Due to the fact that improvement of the condition may not begin for the first couple of weeks, patients should be observed during this early phase of treatment. Patients suffering from major depressive episodes are a high suicide risks and should be closely supervised.<br>  Because of the well-established comorbidity between depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, the same precaution that are observed when treating depressed patients should be observed when treating patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder.|`|9yky3Q9saa	Yeah, don't do that.

CugCzH9iaa	This is a new RX.  You have not worn glasses before right?  Your brain has to get use to the fact that you need this RX. now.  It can take a week or two of wearing them to start to feel normal with them on.  Are these cheapy's from a pharmacy?  The material of these types can be pretty bad sometimes and you could have distortion in them which would give you headaches as well.  I would suggest investing in a pair made at an optical.  The material used is much better and clearer!!! Either way though you'd have headaches at first.  Wear them a couple weeks and see if it gets any better.  If not then you might want a re-check by the dr. or get you some better glasses.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Go back to the people who made your glasses.  Sometimes its not the prescription that's wrong, its the angle of the lens in the frame or some other subtle mistake that can give you terrible headaches.  That shouldn't be happening and they can and will fix it.
f8mLpPXlaa	Absolutely. The first time you clean it you'll see why. It's amazing!
f8mLpPXlaa	Yes, there's a very good chance because you don't have asthma. What you do have is intolerance to exercise due to lack of muscle tone ,under ventilated lungs from your usual position and the obesity.<br>  Of course I'm assuming you're referring to shortness of breath on exertion. Also is smoking included in there? Drinking?<br>  Change your lifestyle again and most of your health problems will go away.

KyLPJ7IEaa	Dump out the old wetting/soaking solution from the lens case.  The case should be rinsed with contact lens solution or hot water and allowed to dry.  <br>  <br>  The lens case must be rinsed daily and refilled with fresh solution in order to maintain maximum strength for disinfecting the lenses. Old solution that is merely “topped-off” will fail to kill microorganisms effectively and, if the tip from the solution container is immersed in the old solution while the bottle is squeezed, the dirty solution will be suctioned up and the entire bottle of solution contaminated.  <br>  <br>  Replace your lens cases every three months, and sterilize it it between.

82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	You're not dieting right if you're getting headaches from not feeling full. You need to change the types of foods you eat. If you eat more raw veggies and fruits, they fill you up faster and longer so you're not feeling the hunger pangs.|`|a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	If I had to guess you simply are not eating enough. Use these tips to figure out how much you should be eating. <br>  <br>  Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to: <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum and is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat (equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bar(awesome snack, 150 calories, 10g of protein! 3g fiber you can not do better, also comes in Peanut Butter and Chocolate), Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle).<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snack or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Smaller but more. Each smaller snacks more often instead of big meals. This really does work and will definately increase your metabolism. I eat a South Beach Cereal Bar every 2 hours all day then a good dinner. They keep me full and they taste pretty good. Caffiene is your friend. It is a natural appetite suppressant so have that cup of coffee!<br>  <br>  Step 7: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 8(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 9: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 10: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that will distract you for a half an hour so that your will can reassert itself and help you to make a rational decision.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Your eating too little if you are getting stomach aches and headaches. You may be eating "Healthy", but not enough. Don't eat things that say "Fat Free" or "Sugar Free". Breakfast is very important. I usually eat Cereal with Fruit, and for Lunch I have a good sized chef salad or grilled chicken salad, Soup, or an egg white omelette. For dinner I have a sensible dinner of whatever we are eating. Lots of fruit and veggies will fill you up, as well as apples and pears. Also when you are feeling weak with a headache, eat a banana. You won't have a stomach ache if you put more food in it.|`|AA10648704	I've been following the diabetic diet, which is basically eating the categories on the food pyramid in the servings recommended.  But instead of eating 3 meals a day, you eat 3 small meals plus three small snacks.  That way you never feel hungry, because you're always eating (or at least it feels like it).  I've actually had times when I have to remind myself to eat!  I've cheated some, and I take Sundays off, but I've still lost 18 pounds since July.|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions
TPg4FRVsaa	you cant change your distinct smell. but in the vaginal area, drinking lots of water 64+ ounces a day and you eat healthy, that amyn times tends to help. But if your vaginal area smells "bad" even after taking showers and practicing good hygiene you should go see your ob/gyn.

6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	I totally get where you're coming from. I'm a 30E, have been since I was 15. It's a pain.<br>  <br>  Don't let what guys say get you down. I know it's hard, but they can call you a slut from sunup to sundown, and it won't make you one. If you are uncomfortable, then try layering your tops. A cami and then a t shirt, or even a long sleeved t with a short sleeved over it. Make it YOUR style, but modest and comfortable for you. Being shy makes it worse, but try to be as confident as you can. There's nothing wrong with you, and eventually idiot boys grow up (well...most of them do) and will see you for all of your other abilities too.<br>  <br>  Pain like that means your bra is the wrong size. It surprised me too, I just assumed that if a 34B doesn't fit, I get a 34C, and then a 34D, but it doesn't work like that. A lot of women wear the wrong size. Go into a store like Victoria's Secret or Macy's or another store with a lingerie section, and ask them to measure you. You might find that you are something unusual. And if they don't have the size bra you need, they have them online. America doesn't make a size 30E bra, so I use <br>  <a href="http://www.figleaves.com/uk/home.asp?cm_re=header-_-leftlogo-_-logo" rel="nofollow">http://www.figleaves.com/uk/home.asp?cm_...</a><br>  <br>  You'll find that the right sized bra will actually make them bounce a little less and maybe even look a little smaller, so it will get you less notice.

Be happy and enjoy your life.  What you worry for, is infact a great asset for you.In my opinion you are really lucky. Have positive attitude and don't bother for other's comment.|`|u9I9jjF5aa	You're gonna have to confront them, even maybe seem like what is often called a 'frigid *****' in order to get them to back off.  My friend had your problem and it wasn't until she snapped and actually grabbed one guy's junk through his pants and squeezed hard enough to bruise him that they finally stopped.  Men are jerks in general, especially in HS, if you don't confront them, they won't get it and will keep on disrespecting you.  Just be glad you're lucky, at least the disrespect they're giving you can be dispelled by a squeeze.  I had bad acne in HS and had to clean my locker at least once a week from when some bastard stuck a slice of pepperoni pizza in there...  I don't even like pepperoni.<br>  <br>  Added:  Whoever suggested dressing provocatively is an idiot, that'll only egg them on.  And don't bank on them being more mature in college, they can be just as immature (sometimes worse b/c they don't have to think about dealing with their parents in the morning).  I might suggest instead of wearing provocative or baggy clothing, you wear clothing that's been fitted for you to make you look good but not 'oh, I can just inch this up and bleep her now' sort of dress.  A fitted shirt and a pair of jeans can command a certain amount of respect, especially if you take care of the rest of your appearance.|`|4VDWKHX3aa	Sorry to be so blunt but it's one way or the other: you're not attractive and you got the boobs that should have went to someone else OR you're attractive and they hate that they haven't gotten their hands on them.

I am glad I was in Soccer and a big bad a$$ so no one would f** with me, however, I would bully girls all the time which is why I dont like seeing people from high school cause they think I'm still the same. I'm not, but anywho, I think you should say smart comments, "...you wish your girlfriend had these girls" or "dont be mad cause you can't touch". If it gets to the point where it's too disrespectful, let a teacher know. When you get older and have a job and people make fun of you... they lose their jobs. :) Such a wonderful thing to be a woman. :) SEXUAL HARASSEMENT is wonders and guys would DEFINITELY stop f**** with you. :) Good luck girlie and be glad that you have those.

DFSDEX78aa	I can say you can lose weight by jogging.  I have been jogging for over twenty years and I lost 40 pounds and have maintained my weight.  You will need to watch your diet.<br>  <br>  I started by jogging for a mile.  Gradually,  I increased my mileage over the years.  I jogged when I was pregnant.  After I had my son I weighed less than before I got pregnant.  Currently, I run six miles a day.  I did lose flab on my thighs by jogging different routes with hills.  Good Luck.|`|MLLCn4weaa	Yes, of course.<br>  <br>  I used to run 6 miles - about 1 hour.|`|xFTAeLtcaa	ive said this so many times.....<br>  <br>  my wife lost 3 stone in six months just by jogging in the house on the spot, using a wii fit...........so simple. 30 mins a day|`|HhXQnSznaa	I usually take a lap around my park three times a week.

The type 1 herpes virus can be spread through oral sex—what was a cold sore on your partner may develop as genital herpes on you.

If your bf have the slightest suspicion. he have genital herpes or any STD for that matter, he should be tested by the doctor.  <br>  <br>  he may have to be tested more than once since it takes a few weeks for the antibodies to show up in your bloodstream. for more information maybe u can try this site <a href="http://get-std-treatment.info" rel="nofollow">http://get-std-treatment.info</a>|`|22d15d6315e57472928cfed3bdf73d1caa	Yes, but its less likely for female to male transmission in oral, but its common in male to female transmission during oral sex.

There are free clinics everywhere- try your local planned parenthood. I know it sounds cliche and a little condescending, but making him get tested is about Respecting Yourself! Herpes is FOREVER.

Which will happen, especially with ambien. I had an episode with ambien and I became addicted to it, It makes you depressed all the time and all u wanna do is take the pills and oh god a nite your like a feen wanted the damn things. It will eventually make you so depressed and unhappy you could even hurt yourself, especially since you are on bi-polar meds, like lithium. Ps. Ambien made me break out, so that could be why u have a rash. I would say go to the doctor and start to ween off some of these meds, this is very dangerous and could eventually take ur life.|`|yHHdAMnQaa	It is the sleeping pills causing this and not the face cream... you need help and need another doctor who will help you gradually decrease your sleeping pills and not cold turkey unless the doctor sees cold turkey will not harm your health then it is find... why are you on sterodis?|`|xnZi0i8saa	It was more likely an allergic reaction to the pills which is why your doctor stopped them immediately. It is not a symptom of overdose. If you continue to take them you could end up in anaphylactic shock..... do as your doctor says.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mental Survivor - Prednisone (the steroid she is on)  is a powerful immune system inhibitor which is used in cases of severe allergic reaction. She cannot be tapered off these drugs, she developed a severe allergy to them, she could kill herself just by taking one or two........<br>  <br>  I wasn't saying that you are addicted to steroids. I have been through exactly what you have. The steroid they gave you is called prednisone, it is not like the steroids that athletes take..... it is used for severe allergic reactions. They gave it to you because you developed an allergy to the sleeping pills. it can happen even if you have been taking them for years. The steroids are to stop the allergic reaction and they can't give you more of the sleeping pills because you are now allergic to them. The more you take the worse yoru reaction will be.
1fjhg6j4aa	I was on my own variation of the Atkins diet years ago.  During the first two weeks, I lost about ten pounds then I lost about 3 pounds a week, for a total loss of 35 pounds.  <br>  <br>  My variation stuck with the atkins diet except for one change.  After the initial two weeks, I allowed myself one "splurge" day each week. I could eat whatever I wanted on that day.  It worked because I wastn't tempted to cheat throughout the week.  I saved my cravings for my splurge day.|`|qzRDh8Rgaa	I just wanna say I just spent so much time writing this....<br>  <br>  Veronica. Look I get you, you think you can handle or do the Atkins thingy and be comfortable doing it and your goal is to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Lemme fill you in on these diets. These diet plans are about eating less or consuming less calories than you should, in order to lose weight.<br>  <br>  I can see you have at least some motivation, you wanna lose weight, and you wanna eat right.<br>  <br>  So how about I give you a diet, you don't pay nearly as much, and we will call it the cool diet.<br>  <br>  So you wanna lose weight right? 2 Things are required, that's all I ask for.<br>  <br>  You eat less, and you eat right.<br>  <br>  By all means don't think I'm the type of person to boil some broccoli and eat them with sweet potatoes and lemon juice, yuck. <br>  <br>  Eat less means, well eat from 1000-1400 calories/day. (It kinda depends on how much you work out) But that range is weight loss range.<br>  <br>  Eat smart means: Cut out all the rubbish. Eat stuff that is better for you. Whether it is filling foods or foods vital to a healthy diet. I will spill what my mind has for you this morning.<br>  <br>  Okay, I hope you're still reading just cuz I really like to help people with this kind of crap.<br>  <br>  Eat smaller meals. That feel like big meals. So ya if someone says eat an apple, you wanna choke them, like come on, that's not filling... and you're still hella hungry.<br>  <br>  I want you to eat this stuff. <br>  <br>  Low fat turkey/roast beef. It is usually 95-98% Fat Free. You get them in plastic packages, little boxes or bags. So turkey is a meat and that contains a good amount of protein, so you wouldn't get weak, lose muscle mass. You wanna lose fat. Turkey is very low in calories, so is low fat roast beef.<br>  <br>  It is filling when you put it in between bread, 2 slices. But this bread isn't some super high in calories sourdough/white bread/muffin crap. This is simple wheat bread that is 70 calories per slice. So what I am doing is instead of getting 2 pieces of bread that are 140 calories each, I am getting ones that are 70 calories each.<br>  <br>  So turkey/roast beef about 50 calories, 2 slices of bread, about 140 calories together, and then you ad mustard, 0 calories, then lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions, about 20-50 calories. <br>  <br>  And believe me, that is a filling sandwich, all those condiments and you are looking at around 220 calories of a filling sandwich. So counting calories is key, honestly you want to count calories, be aware of what you are eating. I am not gonna write you recipes don't worry, I am just telling you that instead of getting a piece of chicken with half a spoon of butter or olive oil and cooking it with some pasta... you can have a healthier alternative, more importantly less calories.<br>  <br>  So with that sandwich here is what I eat, I love SO much, baby carrots, they are oh so good, and filling! Sometimes, not always, I dip them in Fat Free Ranch. I can eat a whole bag! like 2 lbs...lol<br>  <br>  Anyways, here are some foods that you should eat.<br>  <br>  Tuna, Lean/Low Fat Turkey/Roast Beef, Wheat Bread/Whole Grain, If you have to have dairy, like cheese, then ONLY, Fat Free Cream Cheese, diet soda is fine, Fat Free Refried Beans (Taco Bell Canned Brand), Grapes, Baby Carrots, Sugar Free Jello.<br>  <br>  Here is how I love my tuna, either with bread or without, add chopped lettuce and lemon juice, and pickles... and it's really good, why tuna? Protein and very little fat like 2 grams. And very filling.<br>  <br>  Okay here is what you should never eat/put in your mouth.<br>  <br>  Potatoes (BAD For Weight Loss)<br>  Oily/Buttery/Sugary/Fried Stuff<br>  Anything sweet that has sugar in it, bad.<br>  No fast food, no junk food, no food with butter oil whatever.<br>  No milk, please dairy is yummy but full of fat and high in calories, not the most filling stuff.<br>  4 Slices of Bread a day is enough, don't go crazy on the bread.<br>  <br>  <br>  So the main idea, eat less eat smart. Eat less and you will lose fat.<br>  <br>  Okay, you don't have to exercise-BUT! If you do it is like turbo, it is like putting gas in a car! It will speed the whole weight loss process up, insanely, if you do 15 minutes of running/day or 5 days a week, and get your body going to where you need a rest and you are huffin and puffing.. then this will help you a lot, get your metabolism going, like the engine of a car.. Honestly fat loss is 85% diet, so you can diet without exercising, but if you exercise it will multiply and speed up how fast you lose that fat.<br>  <br>  Always feel satisfied, one last thing you will like.<br>  POPCORN.<br>  Yup, go spend that $20 that you were gonna drop on a pizza, which I must say is the worst thing you can eat, and spend it on an air popper, a popcorn maker that doesn't use oil or butter. Popcorn is so filling and 150 calories of it ... is like a microwaved bag size... it is better to eat that starch filled bowl of popcorn that head over to McDonalds... and inhale about 1500 calories of fat...<br>  <br>  So ya, I know I helped, lol... but this is all up to you... I'm only 19 and in col|`|0uSPPAb5aa	You can drop as much as 10 pounds in a week ,with exercise. This is not the healthiest diet to much protein.As soon as you go off it you will gain the weight back.

uVmwUqhIaa	In order to make sure that your cold sore does not swell up beyond disbelief, apply an icepack wrapped in a wash cloth or plastic bag to your blister when you are not busy. This will help with any swelling that may occur, thus making the cold sore less noticeable. One of the best cold sore OTC ointments I have ever used is Campho-Phenique. This product is wonderful. It helps dry out the cold sore. It also helps relieve itching and pain. This ointment usually dries out my cold sores in two to four days. Make sure that you do not pick at the cold sore. When you bust the blister, it spreads the virus. Allow the blister to dry up and scab over on its own. Also allow the scab to fall away on its own. If you must, you can cut away any loose scabbing. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|u6ExZKkJaa	Lavender oil, not shore how long it will take, but lavender oil helps all sorts of skin problems!

AA10216351	An ASD (atrial septal defect) is a defect in the walls of the atria in the heart, while a VSD (ventricular septal defect) is a defect in the walls of the ventricles in the heart.|`|2sycPf8Daa	ASD: An atrial septal defect is a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of your heart. The condition is present from birth (congenital). Smaller atrial septal defects may close on their own during infancy or early childhood. <br>  ASD: An atrial septal defect allows freshly oxygenated blood to flow from the left upper chamber of the heart (left atrium) into the right upper chamber of the heart (right atrium). There it mixes with deoxygenated blood and is pumped to the lungs, even though it's already refreshed with oxygen.<br>  Large and long-standing atrial septal defects can damage your heart and lungs. An adult who has had an undetected atrial septal defect for decades may have a shortened life span from heart failure or high blood pressure in the lungs. Surgery is usually necessary to repair atrial septal defects to prevent complications. <br>  <br>  VSD: A ventricular septal defect occurs when the septum, the muscular wall separating the heart into left and right sides, fails to form fully between the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) during fetal development. This leaves an opening that allows mixing of new (oxygenated) and used (deoxygenated) blood. As a result, blood overfills the lungs and overworks the heart. If not treated, the blood pressure in the lungs goes up (pulmonary hypertension) and the ventricles enlarge and no longer work efficiently. Ultimately, this can lead to irreversible damage to the lung arteries and to congestive heart failure. A ventricular septal defect (VSD), also called a "hole in the heart”, is a common heart defect that's present at birth. <br>  Therefore!<br>  <br>  ASD: An atrial septal defect is a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of your heart(atriums)  <br>  VSD: A ventricular septal defect is a hole in the wall between the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). <br>  <br>  Take care as always!|`|AA12266052	An atrial septal defect is one or more openings in the interatrial septum, producing a left-to-right shunt, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure. Symptoms and signs include exercise intolerance, dyspnea, fatigue, and atrial arrhythmias. A soft midsystolic murmur at the upper left sternal border is common. Diagnosis is by echocardiography. Treatment is surgical or catheter-based repair. Endocarditis prophylaxis is not usually required.<br>  <br>  A ventricular septal defect is one or more openings in the interventricular septum, producing a shunt between ventricles. Large defects result in a significant left-to-right shunt and produce dyspnea with feeding and poor growth. A loud, harsh, holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border is common. Recurrent respiratory infections and heart failure may develop. Diagnosis is by echocardiography. Defects may close spontaneously during infancy or require surgical repair. Endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended.<br>  <br>  Atrioventricular (AV) septal defect consists of primum type atrial septal defect with AV valve malformation, with or without a ventricular septal defect. These defects result from maldevelopment of the endocardial cushions. Defects may be asymptomatic if small. If large, they may cause heart failure, with dyspnea with feeding, poor growth, tachypnea, diaphoresis, or arrhythmias. A single loud S2 and heart murmur are common. Diagnosis is by echocardiography or cardiac catheterization. Treatment is surgical repair for moderate to severe cases. Endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended.

Is your health bad? Are you depressed? <br>  <br>  since there are so many reasons why you could be feeling lethargic the solution could be varied.In the first few weeks after giving birth, some young mothers experience unexplained sadness and lethargy. Even women who were happy to have the baby can become moody. Such mood swings are not unusual. This is because after giving birth, women can experience dramatic changes in hormone levels. It is also common for a new mother to be overwhelmed by the demands of motherhood—feeding, changing diapers, and caring for the baby, who has no concept of time.<br>  In Japan an apparently new phenomenon affecting mainly teens and young adults has emerged. Called hikikomori (acute social withdrawal), it came to public attention during investigations into a number of vicious crimes committed by reclusive young people. “Research into the lifestyle of the perpetrators showed that their hermetic way of life—shut up for months on end in their rooms with little more than a computer or a video game for company—was far from exceptional,” reports the medical journal The Lancet. Other evidence indicates that hikikomori is more often manifested by lethargy than by violence. Still, “there is broad agreement that this illness is a product of the affluence, technology, and convenience of modern Japanese life,” states The Lancet. “Many hikikomori spend most of their waking hours on the internet or playing video games, while snacking on food and drink delivered to their homes.” Some estimates place the number of reclusive young people in Japan at one million.<br>  <br>  Act as You Want to Feel<br>  <br>  To overcome a deep depression, one needs to persist in pursuing real cheerfulness and kindliness. (Compare Acts 20:35.) This calls for breaking through the entrenched mood of loneliness by acting just the opposite of its deadening lethargy. Act happy, dance around, sing a jolly song. Do anything reflecting happiness. Exaggerate it, overdo it, crowd out the morose mood with happy thoughts. Such as?<br>  <br>  Such as those at Philippians 4:8: “Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern, whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chaste, whatever things are lovable, whatever things are well spoken of, whatever virtue there is and whatever praiseworthy thing there is, continue considering these things.”<br>  <br>  The need is to put some meaning into your life. If you feel that your life has some meaning, you will be energized to respond to that and seek to fulfill it. You will not likely fall into a feeling of despondent loneliness. This is interestingly shown in Viktor Frankl’s book Man’s Search for Meaning. He discusses it relative to prisoners in Hitler’s concentration camps. Those who had no sense of meaning in their lives succumbed to loneliness and lacked the will to live. But “the consciousness of one’s inner value is anchored in higher, more spiritual things, and cannot be shaken by camp life.” He continued: “Suffering ceases to be suffering in some way at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of sacrifice. .?.?. Man’s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain, but rather to see a meaning in his life. That is why man is even ready to suffer, on the condition, to be sure, that his suffering has a meaning.”

VnCVkHDhaa	nah, youll live without it|`|AA11569882	No, the idea of drinking 8 glasses of water a day is a complete myth - unless you are in a desert, you'll be peeing like a racehorse!  The actual amount of water your body needs to survive on is actually mostly found in our food, only two or three glasses more a day is more than enough.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Let your bladder be you guide as to how much is too much.  When it becomes a noted inconvenience, it is too much.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	8 glasses a day has been proven to be unnecessary for most people.  As long as you don't have symptoms of dehydration such as a headache, extreme thirst, or dark yellow urine, 4-5 bottles of water sounds like plenty of water.  Also, liquids such as clear broth and fruits and vegetables also fulfill water requirements.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	No, that is a fallacy. Drinking 4-5 bottles a day, is a lot, unless you are running a marathon everyday! Drink 2-3 bottles a day,(16 oz. bottles) soups , coffee, teas,fruits and veggies or anything that becomes a liquid, is a liquid or has a liquid in it, should be included in your liquid intake, too.

It is just recommended to drink 8 glasses of water to give you an example of the amount of liquids you need everyday to be healthy. <br>  If you are drinking 4-5 bottles of water a day, that's great and is plenty to stay healthy.  It's also important to eat a healthy diet, which gives you fluids too.

The protein and fiber will stayin your system longer and you will feel fuller longer.|`|U2OAKAQaaa	A fiber cereal.|`|4Zd1cQXaaa	Protein powder is great, and can really help the texture, as well as add flavour, depending on what type you get.  <br>  <br>  Flax seed or hemp seed give you all of your good fatty acids for the day, which will give you a boost! You can also add an oil mixture (such as Udos Oil) which will give you all of your good oils, and helps fill you up.  <br>  <br>  Almond butter and tahini also work well, and will also get some good oils into your diet.  <br>  <br>  Store bought yogurt will add thickness, but yogurt is very fatty, and much of the good bacteria present in the yogurt is dead.  A better option is to add some kefer, which you can make yourself, and will give you all the good bacteria your body needs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|NMwxOdQQaa	More Yogurt; and add Some Icecream;<br>  You should also eat a rice cake with it. =]

But if you feel very fatigued before or during running you may want to eat something light before you run.|`|zNn9VfRyaa	i'd say after u run<br>  to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions|`|LywVUxsTaa	That is a good thing to eat.  Before exercise it is good to have a small amount of healthy carbs and a little bit of protein, which is what you are getting with the apple and milk.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|GvBtoKsqaa	I second the one who suggested hanging leg raises. They are a truly amazing exercise for lower abs. And since they are difficult they're good calories burners too. You'll know they're effective the day after you do them when you get some serious DOMS.|`|iAv9P3HTaa	A "quick" way to get abs is in the combination of diet and exercises.<br>  It depends on body fat with males it starts showing under 10%.<br>  These exercises much more effective then push ups or sit ups:<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Crunch<br>  Lie with the ball resting under the mid/lower back and place hands behind the head or across the chest. Contract your abs to lift your the torso off the ball, pulling the bottom of your ribcage down toward your hips. As you curl up, keep the ball stable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crunch & Reach<br>  Begin with body straight over the ball, light weight extended behind you (not shown). Contract the abs to lift and bring the weight over the head, crunching up and twisting to the right, contracting the right side of waist. Repeat for all reps and then switch sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Modified Plank<br>  Begin by placing elbows on the floor and resting body on the knees. Pull the abs tight to hold your body in a straight line from head to knees without sagging in the middle, eyes looking naturally forward. Hold this position for as long as you can, relax and repeat 3 or more times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Knee Tucks<br>  Start in plank position on the ball, with the ball under the shins/ankles. Roll the ball towards you with your feet, tightening the abs into a crunch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Woodchops<br>  Attach one end of a resistance band to something sturdy and wrap the band around your hand a few times for the right tension. Grasp the band in both hands and begin in a lunge position, reaching down with the arms Keeping the arms straight the entire time, rotate and lift the body towards the other side while sweeping the arms on a diagonal. Return to start and repeat before moving onto the other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hip Extension on the Ball<br>  Lie on the floor with feet heels propped on ball. Keeping abs tight, slowly lift your hips off the floor (squeezing the buttocks) until body is in a straight line. Hold for a few seconds and lower<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Taps<br>  Sit on the ball with strong abs and straight spine, hands behind the head. Contract your abs and lift the right foot, tapping it on a medicine ball in front of you. Lower and repeat with the other foot, alternating sides. Use your abs to keep your balance.<br>  <br>  How to Work Your Abs<br>  <br>  * You can effectively work your abs with 3 non-consecutive workouts a week<br>  * Do 1-3 sets of 12-16 reps of each exercise. If that's too easy, make sure you're doing each exercise correctly and using perfect form. You can add a dumbbell or plate to crunches to add difficulty.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|fTztIC22aa	For lower abs you can obliterate them with hanging leg raises<br>  <br>  Hang from anything and keep you legs together and slowly raise them until they're at a 90 degree angle with your body and slowly let them down until they're at about 30 degrees (not straight down so they stay contracted through the entire set).|`|5cbILl1caa	bicycle crunches<br>  <br>  captains chair<br>  <br>  <br>  or by, lying flat...raise your legs to the ceiling 90 degrees, and slowly lower it to the ground (keep your legs straight)|`|fcd41ae13b5b45292cfeda0b4cdff32baa	try using butterfly abs|`|Qcp2HtoUaa	Lay on the floor on your back, raise your legs slowly up and down keeping your legs as straight as possible, and keep your hands on your lower back to support it.

Y4s4Om38aa	Have been on both.  Prefer the Welbutrin....am on welbutrin SR now.  Definitly DO NOT take effexor before talking to him if that is not what he was going to prescribe you.  He should not be giving you samples of one thing and then prescribing you another......he probably accidently gave you the wrong one.  I didnt have any issues with it, but many people find effexor to be an extremely difficult med to come off of, so dont want to go on it just to have to come back off of it because it not being what he wanted to give you anyway.  Did he give you a prescription or was he just having you try it from samples for a few weeks and seeing how it goes?<br>  <br>  Also, if he meant to give you samples of wellbutrin and gave you effexor instead, the dosing and tapering on would not be the same.<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  That sounds about typical for how a dr would start you on an antidepressant.  Give you the samples to get you started and tapered on, and then see how it is going in 4 weeks.  4 weeks would give it enough time to be able to tell if it is helping any.  But you deffinitly need to clarify what he wants you on.  And what dosage to taper on by as you dont know where he ended up switching between the 2.  He either accidently gave you the wrong samples, or said the wrong thing when he was talking to you.......i think more likely said what he really wanted you on, then just went into autopilot when he gave you the samples.   I know the first time i went to my psychiatrist, she said she wanted to try me on wellbutrin, and then she wrote the Rx for paxil.  She did mean wellbutrin and just went in autopilot writing the rx.  I caught it and pointed it out and she changed it.  Effexor does have a lot of people that have bad side effects on it....worst being when coming off it.   I did not.  You may, may not......never know with any of these meds til you try it.<br>  <br>  Favorite site to look up info on psych meds..   www.crazymeds.us  very infomative|`|dSd5reJdaa	I was on Effoxor for a year.. and within that year I gained about 10 lbs. However, I'm not sure if I gained weight because the meds made me happier and I wasn't all depressed and not eating anymore.. But after the weight gain.. I didn't gain anymore weight, so it could have just been getting me back on track to my normal size. Later, I switched to Prozac, which if anything is supposed to make you lose weight.. <br>  <br>  Good Luck
OddQy8Kmaa	If your really interested in growing fat then instead of eating lot consult a doctor he will advice you how to eat and when to eat normally we don't take right diet at right time that's the main reason for which we don't grow in health, So all you have to do is concentrate on your figure instead on the fats which will make you looks beautiful and sexy.<br>  I thought many girls like to be thin but likes to have figure in their parts that's it so you too consult some adviser how to keep your figure perfect so for which can be attractive and impress the other person.|`|b2yD0TyEaa	yeah you're Matchstick actually i can see you from here anyway i was joking .

If you had a recent growth spurt, then just give it time - your weight will catch up to your body. Overall though, if you want to gain some weight (and I don't recommend "growing fat") then consider eating more protein, higher fats foods (like cheeses and milkshakes) and doing some muscle building, not just aerobic activity. But really, just give it time - your body is still growing and changing if you are only 13.|`|EwR91zQuaa	just eat untill you gain weight duh..|`|4d8QwNQGaa	Eating a diet of simple carbs will only burn up right away with your active lifestyle. Try a variety  of whole foods with complex carbohydrates and proteins. Avocados and nuts are healthy, yet have a high fat content.  Heavy, or unleavened breads will "stick to your ribs" while providing ample energy for the development and activity of a 13 year old body. <br>  <br>  Don't worry. As long as you are healthy, you will start to gain weight as your body matures. Keep your health care practitioner informed of your concerns, as they may be able to help ease your stress and recommend practical advise. <br>  <br>  If you haven't, you should have your thyroid checked. A simple blood test will let you know if you have an overactive thyroid that may be contributing to your delima.<br>  <br>  Good Luck..|`|qzRDh8Rgaa	Instead of growing fat here is what you should do.<br>  <br>  Eat more meat, like steak,tuna,chicken,fish,turkey and roast beef.<br>  <br>  This stuff will make you stronger, and will bulk you up, you will have a nice tone, and gain some weight, not necessarily fat.<br>  <br>  You don't want fat, you wanna be healthy, just make sure you are getting your protein so you can perform better, gain weight and strength.<br>  <br>  Basketball rocks.|`|jgpESnd7aa	Hi,Being a minor, I wud hesitate to give you more details.<br>  In short I'd love to introduce our nutrition based products which<br>  could help you attain<br>  ? improved energy, <br>  ? weight control, <br>  ? general wellness <br>  If this strikes a chord of interest with you then we should talk more. <br>  I can forward to you more details and information.<br>  <br>  kevinrebello@live.it<br>  Milan, ITALY|`|e8bRcVNAaa	Eat a dozen d*** doughnuts, that will definately fatten anyone up!

LsHkgexvaa	I don't believe your a hypochondriac. The symptoms you describe could be a result of thoracic nerve damage or other problems with the spine.

Just clarification.|`|GAHFiIqSaa	The symptoms of hypochondria are cause by a ghost/spirit. The tingling sensations are the feeling of a spirit in physical contact. Consider your short stabbing pains as this spirit's attempt to get your attention. There is nothing really wrong with you. As a matter of fact, having such a spiritual presence is really a blessing.<br>  <br>  As evidence, when you next experience any of your symptoms, try to communicate with it. Use your thoughts (telepathy) to communicate with a spirit. Start by thinking, "hello, can you hear me," or a similar type thought. You will hear its responses in your mind as if you thought them.

GT6396BDaa	It is ok to take Cephalexin with Tylenol Cold Night Time.  It is also known as Keflex, which is a common antibiotic that treat infections caused by bacteria, such as ear infections. The Tylenol Cold Night Time will not affect it at all.  Just remember to take it with a glass of water.  <br>  Doctors usually prescribe 10 days worth of Cephalexin.  It should start working within 4-5 days, but it is important to take all of the medicine.  You might feel better, but you should take all the medicine to make sure the infection is gone.<br>  Hope you feel better.|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	Keflex is pretty potent and you shuold start feeling better in about 24 hrs.

BO28Mn8haa	The food cravings are simply because our bodies are asking for certain nutrients/flavors/etc. So we crave the food that we enjoy that has this. This is why certain women crave pickles when their body needs more salt intake. Or chocolate when they need more feel-good endorphins.<br>  <br>  Bloated and soreness are basically minor pregnancy symptoms. Your body always prepares itself for pregnancy, and when it doesn't, you get your period.. along with those nasty little side affects.<br>  <br>  The irritability, anxiety and headaches are hormonal changes which happen during your period.<br>  <br>  And the lifelessness is God's little way of saying "fu*k you" lol|`|PYIA2FCFaa	im not sure why either. i think it just has something to do with our hormone levels. i dont know if you have ever been pregnant but, its the same crap lol.|`|1dfd90ec99e7ca43256c4d9f2f92f46caa	chocolate makes you release endorphins, hence making you happy when your prone to becoming moody<br>  <br>  salt balances your blood|`|H93JbQS0aa	Its sad but part of being woman!! when i come on two days before i dont know why but i just feel so so hungary i want to eat everything i can get my hands on lol|`|HIav9sVuaa	i knww i get it reli bad and i pass out its all our hormones i think|`|RVW9mTx9aa	I'm not a woman, but chocolate has "feel good" chemicals in it that literally make you feel good.

9snxL5MMaa	The tooth in the socket is surrounded and connected to the surrounding bone via millions of nerves..these nerves can relate to sensations like pain and pressure..when the tooth is compressed the tooth presses against these nerves which get compressed against the bone of the socket...which in turn try to squeeze the blood out of them leading to pain..and when the pressure is released the tooth comes back into its original state and so does the nerves which reduces the pain..that is why when your orthodontist tightens the wire your teeth hurt for a few days because the process of demineralization of the bone at the site of pressure and remineralization in the direction of the force  is taken place in the socket and bone of the teeth..and when the action of the wire is achieved in a few days the pain reduces..<br>  <br>  Pathfinder!!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Something in the nerve.

1tiCB311aa	I know how you feel. I was a cross country runner for years and have suffered shin splints. It really hurts! <br>  <br>  Shin splints is an inflammation of the tissues in the lower leg causing pain with exercise. It is common in those who walk, jog, or run on hard, uneven surfaces. The pain can radiation down the front and side of the leg, extending down the back and inner leg and ankle. <br>  The pain can worsens with exercise.<br>  <br>  Here are some tips my running coach used on me and they helped with the pain and healing. You have to rest. A gentle massage with lubricating oil will help and decrease swelling. An ice massage may also help using a circular movement over the area three to four times daily for 10-15 minutes. Some find heat works better. Apply a heating pad or lamp, a hot shower, or whirlpool. I liked the ice.<br>   My running coach tapped the anterior leg and you can raise the heel portion of the shoe approximately one-eighth of an inch. <br>  <br>  The way you walk or run is also important. Hold your body erect rather than leaning forward and avoid landing directly on your toes. <br>  Wear well-fitting shoes that offer lateral and arch support with cushioning for the ball and heel of the foot. You should change your running or walking shoes every six months. <br>  <br>  Avoid running or walking blacktop and concrete. Jog or walk on soft surfaces such as dirt or grass.|`|VOIOKYEvaa	You get shin splints by doing vigorous physical activity every day like running. Shin splints are where your bones start to "fray" around where your muscles pull away from them. If you have a vitamin deficiency your bones might wear a bit more than they should. A doctor might prescribe some pain medication and physical therapy, but mostly you need to take it easy for a while to let them heal. You might want to get it checked out either way.|`|Oof352lkaa	It might be shin splints.  If you run or jog, don't do that for a week or 2 and stretch your calfs and other legs muscles once or twice a day.  If it doesn't go away go to the doctor.|`|x10AVOpBaa	Me too.

The coach made me ride a bike instead of running warm ups, but since it's part of your daily activity that might be hard to replace.

I think it's one of those muscle things that need time to heal but you could google shin splints to see if there are any new ideas out there.|`|Q5jypS3Gaa	You may have shin splints..

RxHb1P4Faa	It doesn't mater how you get your water intake. There are some food, such as fruit and processes in your body that contribute to your water intake. I don't remember the exact ratio though.

89HhKWuIaa	It depends, they will either cut them out or pull them. If they can pull them, it's about the same as pulling any other tooth, only harder. But you would be awake, but on a lot of Novocain and some places laughing gas. <br>  <br>  If they cut them out (this is what i had done) you will be put under for the process. There isn't anything to be scared of, they put you out and you wake up and its' done. <br>  <br>  The healing process for both can depend on the person and how well they heal and if they followed instructions for after care properly! Good luck!|`|0d9b657fe19e5aa8e1634e830acde7a4aa	Well, you didn't say if the teeth have already erupted. Mine never did, so I was put to sleep and had them cut out from my gums. If yours are already erupted, then they will just pull them like any other tooth and you won't usually be put to sleep (you will get anesthesia though) but it may depend on whether or not your dentist customarily uses gas. Call your dentist office and ask them what the procedure will be. Even if you are numbed locally, you will still feel the pressure of them being pulled out.|`|9FrBtCfDaa	I got my wisdom teeth out when I was 17. They put me under, which was great, because I didn't have to watch. When I woke up I had a vanilla milkshake with a bendy straw and there was barely any pain.. I'm sure there will be plenty of horror stories on here but it is possible to have a good experience. The worst part for me was the stitches. don't play with them!!|`|ZJ6bLAOiaa	Don't be a coward. it just hurt little bit at the first procedure. after that, it not very hurt anymore.|`|BXOOnxXgaa	They will put you out for the procedure.

If your wisdom teeth are still "hidden" in your gums, it will be a bit more difficult than if they've already grown out a little. It also depends on the roots: are they straight or crooked?<br>  I can only speak from my own experience: I had three removed in one go, they were still inside the gums, but it wasn't too bad as the roots were straight. In my case they only used a local anesthetic. They just put some antiseptic pad inside the holes afterwards and a few stitches to fix them.<br>  I could go home straight afterwards and had to take antibiotics plus some anti-inflammatory pills to prevent the swelling. I didn't need many painkillers though. A cooling pad to put on your cheek helps as well!<br>  <br>  Good luck, be brave, - and ask your dentist if you're worried! He should give you all the information you need.|`|mCJHSpJ0aa	Calm down i have had a bigger surgery done on me before i got all my teeth pulled out except for my molars and don't worry it doesn't hurt and yes they will probably put you to sleep, like they did with me, you will be fine. Trust me you are going to want to be put to sleep when they pull out your teeth it will probably be scary but they will numb you. Don't worry you will live.|`|AA10209306	Don't worry about it. I have to get mine out soon and there is nothing to worry about. They will put you to sleep and you won't feel anything. When you wake up you will not feel good because you just had 4 teeth taken out, which is explainable. It is not as bad as some people say it is. I have a lot of friends that have had theirs taken out and they never had a problem. I'm not worried about having mine out. You just might have 2 or 3 days to recover.|`|AA12227599	Well first of all, they usually don't take them all out at once. Two at a time I believe. No, they don't put people to sleep for that, but they do have "happy gas" that will make you really not care. You will feel some pressure, and hear the sound of them crunching and stuff, but it really should not hurt. Until after! Make sure you get something for the pain before you leave.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	i got my top two out. i was awake. it just felt like alot of pressure. the dentist just pushed on them really hard and they popped out. i don't recall feeling any pain afterwards, and i took 3 buses home by myself. it's different for everyone though. my sis-in-law got hers out and was in pain for a few days. i think she's a wuss though|`|cA3PAgetaa	Don't be scared<br>  <br>  They remove them surgically, but you are asleep for it.<br>  <br>  Some people feel fine the very next day<br>  <br>  others are swollen and hurt for about a week<br>  <br>  but they give you good drugs to dull the pain, so it's not so bad ;)|`|xX2pu9hCaa	Well for me, they put me in a resting chair thing and then they explained what they were going to do and then they put me to sleep and then i woke up and they were gone, a bit of pain but the pain medicine helped a lot.|`|9lb1f7leaa	Well it doesn't hurt that bad they give you a whole bunch of laughing gas and then they shove thes metal hooks into the gums and pull them, it doesn't even hurt i've had five teeth pulled so far.|`|hpTstbRraa	some doctors do thing differently but they put me completly to sleep and cut all 4 out.. i didn't regain feeling in my bottom lip for 3 months it was crazy..by the way yes it sucks it feels nasty and it hurts|`|AA11950180	I had mine removed 5 days ago.

By having them removed, you won't have to worry about all sorts of problems with them later. They will be pulled. The dentist will either put you to sleep or give you shots to numb the pain. You won't feel anything and you will heal rapidly.|`|OBn0eZikaa	I had mine out like 2 years ago. My dentist put me to sleep for the operation. When you wake up you won't be able to feel the lower half of your face and if he puts you to sleep it takes up to 24 hours for it to wear off, so you will wake up a lil after the surgery but you will be tired all day. My mouth hurt for a day or two but it wasn't unbearable and they might give you some medicine for that. Just make sure to keep it clean and follow all their directions because where the teeth were can get infected, and that hurts alot and takes a couple days to go away after you get the meds.|`|YCmvBc05aa	Most of the time the surgical removal is done under conscious sedation.<br>  <br>  So, you actually do not go to sleep, but you will not be aware of the surroundings. That is why you'll need someone to be with you to take you home.<br>  <br>  On top of that they will anesthetize the area locally.<br>  <br>  So, you won't feel a thing. <br>  <br>  The main thing is not the procedure itself but the after care.<br>  <br>  Follow all the directions given.<br>  <br>  Take the prescribed pain medication.<br>  <br>  Also, apply a LOT of ice on and off for the rest of the day and even the following day to minimize the swelling, bleeding and pain.....Remember, THAT IS THE KEY TO AVOID PAIN.<br>  <br>  Some people put the ice in the form of a barrel bandage to cover all 4 extraction sites.<br>  <br>  Good luck !!|`|l2mJxB1Caa	I got my wisdom teeth out when i was 20.

Hair removal creams can be quite strong for that area if you want to remove ALL hair. It's just meant for the outer bikini area...(without being too graphic). I would not recommend this if you are particularly sensitive. <br>  <br>  Shaving all of the area causes friction and stubble when growing back, so I'd stay clear of that!!!<br>  <br>  In my opinion waxing is a good method. The best advice is to visit a salon professional. It is a VERY sensitive area and a tricky procedure to do on yourself!! You will need to make sure the area is trim before your appointment. Leave hair about half centimeter long. <br>  <br>  In my opinion (if this is your first wax) start small. Only have the minimum amount of hair removed first. The on your next visit go further. Just in case you are too sensitive. Make sure your therapist makes sure you feel comfortable and is hygienic!! She should use disposables and give you aftercare advice. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :0)

However, exercising when you first wake is a good idea. You can do sit-ups, leg lifts and general contractions. By general contractions, I mean that you can contract a specific muscle group for 10-15 seconds as tight as you can and then release, then repeat. You can also do these while driving or sitting.

PHzWq3anaa	First of all, it's up to your medical doctor if they decide to prescribe Viagra for you.  I believe it is not marketed for anyone under 18, but some MD's will still prescribe it for you.  Maybe not if you're 13, but you can always ask.  That's really a question of personal sexual morals, etc.  But to answer your question, yes Viagra can help you.  It will help you acheive an erection, despite your anxiety.  In fact, if nothing else it could provide a powerful placebo effect.  Essentially, what you need is an effective placebo - aka - confidence in yourself.  <br>  <br>  Despite what everyone on this site says, Viagra does more than simply re-direct blood flow.  Specifically, it minimizes a specific enzyme that is responsible for preventing erections.  Once that enzyme is inhibited, the normal process of achieving erection is allowed to occur.  They are correct that it doesn't effect your libido.  But my guess is that you don't have an issue with your libido, you have an axiety issue.  Your anxiety is preventing you from getting an erection.  Getting an erection requires a state of relation (parasympathetic nervous system).  I don't need to get into the physiology of what's happening in your body, but basically being anxious will prevent your erection.  If you stop worrying about your erection, it will just happen.  The problem is that you have gotten yourself into a vicious cycle.  Each time you don't get an erection, you worry more.  And the more you worry, the harder it is to get an erection.  You tell yourself not to think about it, but the more you tell yourself that, the more you think about it.  You need to break the cycle somehow.  Once you have a successful sexual event, that will build your confidence and you'll probably be fine from that point forward.  Since you are a teenager, I'm not sure how I can help you.  You might ask yourself what kind of partner you are choosing.  Are you intimidated by her in some way?  Do you fear that she won't like it?  You need to find a partner that is very understanding and non-intimidating to you.  You need to feel like you are in the driver seat.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	If your problem is psychological then Viagra will not help you. Viagra will only help you if your problem is physical. Viagra works by relaxing the blood vessels in the penis, this allows more blood to enter enabling you to achieve an erection. Have a chat with your GP.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  I must apologise. My answer was incorrect, it doesn't just help physical problems. Dr Frank corrected me. I thought the indications for Viagra were purely physical- as a result of CAD/Diabetes etc. It can help psychological problems and is often prescribed as a one off to encourage an erection in young men- often solving the problem. It was rather remiss of me not to have checked out my answer first. <br>  <br>  It's vital to first sort out the cause of your erectile dysfunction.This should be done before taking any ED drugs. If your problem is due to anxiety then ask your GP to refer you for therapy. I can't imagine a Doctor will prescribe Viagra to a teenager. <br>  Hope you get to read this edit, apologies again.|`|AA11447210	Instead of posting the same question over and over (which is a violation) ask your doctor.

Just start exercizing more and watching what you eat. What I like to do is go running 3 or 4 times a week (it sucks at first but it doesn't take long to get used to it and start loving it!) and do strength training on the days you don't do cardio. If you want, you can also get some workout videos.. I really like Jillian Michael's 30-Day Shred (you can probably download it online, and it's also pretty cheap on Amazon.com), which you do every day.<br>  <br>  Try to eat 5 small meals a day instead of 3 large ones, if you aren't already. Cut down on sugary, fatty foods and drinks (but you don't have to eliminate them completely, just don't have them very often). Drink lots of water, and eat lots of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. <br>  <br>  <br>  It's important to remember that if you start working out more, the number on the scale might not go down because you'll be gaining muscle while you're losing fat. Maybe get a measuring tape to keep track of your measurements... your weight in pounds may go up or stay the same, but your waist should be getting smaller!|`|C8QTGBYxaa	Hey<br>  try to look on the Internet and get a good diet(eggs are good and don't put on a lot of pounds and fill u up!) and stay AWAY from ice-cream and try swimming and make a routine of going to the gym after work and u must just set Ur mind to it. my mom and her boyfriend are trying to loose weight and have lost i thing 6 kg in 2 weeks BT can loose more if watch there diet more.BT don't forget u still need a little fats Nd oils but all in moderation and try not to eat after 7 pm<br>  Good luck!|`|CQzxvMyCaa	Yes, that sounds totally possible.  I would find an exercise program that got my heart rate up for at least 30 minutes and do it about 5 times a week.  I'd also eat lots of veggies and stay away from sweets, crackers, and other junk food.  Watch fruit juices and sports drinks too - they are often loaded with excess sugar!  The key is to burn off more than you put in.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NOUL05wUaa	Yes, you can lose 10 pounds the best way is to try weight training 2 times a week. day of cardio between, drink more water, and cut out eating any food after 9:00pm, along with any junk food you really don't need like fries and chip etc.|`|A9WCbC8aaa	Try doing Isokinetic movements during your workout.

You should look up how many calories you should eat on <a href="http://www.healthcrazed.com/articles/calculator.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcrazed.com/articles/cal...</a> - and decrease by 10-15 percent to lose weight.|`|sxmQSpagaa	10lbs in that time is a fairly realistic goal. just cut back your calories and eat plenty of protein and fiber to keep you full while you do cardio and muscle building activities. just don't starve yourself! if you dip too low in calories, your body will fight against losing weight. just take it slow and enjoy working out, you'll shed pounds naturally.|`|AA10648704	Try moderate exercise and a balanced diet and you should be fine.  Doctors recommend that you lose no more than 1 to 1 1/2 pounds per week for the best chance of keeping it off, and that's doable.  I'm on the diabetic diet, and though I cheat a little and don't exercise like I should, I've still lost 18 pounds since July.  The diabetic diet is no more than eating the types of food listed in the food pyramid, and in the servings listed (if you're not sure about servings, get a calorie counter that also lists carbohydrates and fats):<br>  <br>  7-9 servings of carbohyrates--15 carbohydrates for each serving (about a slice of bread or 3/4 cup of cereal).  The less processed, the better, so try whole wheat bread or cereal as opposed to sugary foods.<br>  <br>  3-4 servings of milk (8 oz. of low-fat milk or yogurt--the flavored Yoplait yogurts are great)<br>  <br>  7-9 servings of meat or meat substitute (like beans).  As a guideline, 3 oz. is about the size of a deck of cards, and 4 oz. is about the size of the palm of your hand.<br>  <br>  3-4 servings of fruits (1 medium fruit, or about 1/2 cup of juice--the fruit fills you up better, though, and has more fiber)<br>  <br>  4 servings of vegetables (1/2 cup cooked or 1 cup raw, but I wouldn't worry about eating too many here)<br>  <br>  3 servings of fat (about 1 pat of butter or 1 tablespoon of salad dressing)<br>  <br>  The trick with this diet is to spread it out over the course of the day, so you're eating 3 small meals and 3 small snacks a day.  So you could have a piece of fruit, or a fruit and a yogurt, or a small cookie and milk for a snack.  This way, your metabolism is going all the time, and doesn't spike only after you eat a meal.|`|bXX9HjS4aa	That is very reasonable! You should aim for a weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week so 10 is no problem. I suggest doing 45 mins of cardio 5 times a week and 20 mins of strength training 5 times a week, also I am on a low fat diet of 1400 calories a day and I have lost 4 pounds in the past 10 days so I know for a fact it works. Eat healthy and exercise and you will shed the 10 pounds you desire.|`|xhqKLSwCaa	If you drink pop, coffee and juice, drink water instead.  Lots of yummy fruits and veggies, a good breakfast to start your day.  Running, walking, swimming are great ways to keep in shape.

NgnbtaORaa	There are three separate muscles muscles that make up the tricep muscle.  There are only two separate muscles that make up the bicep.  Therefore, the tricep muscle would bulk up faster than your bicep muscle through regular training because of that extra muscle fibre.  Having said that people, more commonly, attempt to define their bicep over their tricep.  This is for the reason that it is difficult to increase bicep mass unless you actively work out the muscle on exercises designed to focus on your bicep area such as bicep curls.<br>  <br>  In contrast to the bicep, the tricep muscle is used for a variety of different exercises and, as a result, the tricep muscle is targeted more often than the bicep is, for example; the tricep muscle is developed through exercises like push-ups, shoulder press', as well as exercises designed to target triceps like tricep dips or tricep curls.<br>  <br>  Ideally, it is best to work on both equally.  shoulder exercises are neglected usually and, furthermore, working on your shoulders allow, both, your tricep and biceps bulk up nicely and a little faster too.  When you work out target a whole area don't just work out a singular muscle or your body will look imbalanced.  So if you are wanting your arms bigger; work out your shoulder muscles, biceps and triceps in one session.<br>  <br>  By separating out muscle areas it allows you to split a work out routine up this maximizes effect.  So one day you work out your arm, leg, and abdominal areas, then, the next day, you focus on chest, back, and your cardio-vascular.|`|XgLWtb8naa	Biceps

This happens because your egg was not fertilized. When you do things such as dirnk lots of water, its not going to affect the thickness of the blood lining, and will not make your period any lighter. <br>  <br>  There are such things as aspirins which thin blood, but this isnt effective for your period. This blood has been in your uterus for 14days and there isnt much way to prevent it from coming out as is.

xnZi0i8saa	I am on Abilify but because I don't do well on most medications my pdoc has me taper up really really slow. I went 1mg every two weeks. I'm only at 3mg so far but I love it already. Because of the slow taper I have no side effects. I don't dring anyway so I can't hepl you there. Ask your doctor or pharmacist. Sometimes they say to not drink because it may make you really drowsey, but sometimes it can be a realyl bad reaction. Your doctor would know best.|`|bjqjkDMHaa	Well...here's my story.  I took it for two days for my Tourette's, first night, I threw up at seven o'clock and would have continued to do so if I hadn't had antinausea medication which I took to stop me from getting the heaves.  The next day I had no fever, no virus and was fine becuase I hadn't taken it again.  Then I tried it again the next day and I threw up again right at seven o'clock like the first day and proceeded again to take the anitnausea meds.  My doctor asked me if I wanted to take it again just to see if it would help, and I said no, not wanting to subject myself to more puking.  That is my story with Abilify.<br>  now for more info:   Abilify, you should know, is an atypical antipsychotic.  Antipsychotics are serious medications with potent chemicals in them that you cannot afford to play around with.  You do not need to drink because, well, like I said, this is a potent chemical that you have ingested so it can help with a chemical imbalance in your brain.   You do not play around with these drugs, understand me?  What will happen if you do?  Well, I've had dystonic reactions to other antipsychotics, my head twisted around to one side and I couldn't move it for anything, my body started shaking and I drooled and threw up until I got an IV of the antidote at the hospital emergency room.  You do not mess around with these drugs, understand me?  They are serious, not to play around with!  You need to watch out for side effects, like muscular contractions and something called tardive dyskenesia, it's where your body starts doing things on its own, I've had it before, on another drug, my mouth started making these weird shapes and my tongue stuck out limply, I had to stop taking the medicine because tardive dyskenesia can be permanent, even when you stop taking it, the side effects can stay with you for the rest of your life.|`|gr4IFLsMaa	While Abilify did help my bipolar disorder, I suffered a side effect medically termed akathisia (inner restlessness) so I had to stop taking it.  It is written in the literature that you shouldn't drink while on Abilify.  That is because I believe the 2 could interact with one another.  I wouldn't drink at all while on Abilify, even occasional drinking if you can to help avoid problems.  It could make your symptoms that you are taking the medicine for worse.  I'm glad the medication works for you and I wish you best of luck in the long term.  Just watch your blood sugar.  Make sure it is checked once every 6 months.  That's what my psychiatrist explained to me anyways.  Best of luck with this medication.

There is only one tried and true method to lose body fat. Eat less and excersize regularly. That's it. Any other method, drug or 'quick' solution does nothing in any long term sense and can in some cases be detrimental to your health.|`|tEcnEFXmaa	They may have lost weight its because they were going to the bathroom smelling it up. Magnesium Citrate definitely gets the bowels clean. You have to stay hydrated as well because it will empty your body of all fluids. It is a quick remedy but after you start back eating again it will build back up. The best thing to do is to have long term effects such as eating right drinking plenty of water and exercising. You may not want to hear that but it's the truth. Being healthy the right way will last a lot longer than a quick 5 day fix.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	well it is a laxative.

AA12266052	Self-care:<br>      * Balance exercise with rest. Walk or do another activity to the point of pain and alternate it with rest periods. Over time, circulation improves as new, small (collateral) blood vessels form.<br>      * Stop smoking. Smoking tightens arteries, decreases the blood's ability to carry oxygen, and increases the risk of forming clots (thrombi and emboli).<br>      * Foot care is particularly important if you also have diabetes.

qxWoiRHwaa	When I had my wisdom tooth extracted I had a huge hole as well. I kept it clean by irrigating with salt water, and it healed very well.<br>  <br>  Go and visit this web site  <a href="http://www.mamagums.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mamagums.com/</a><br>  <br>  She has a formula for baking soda / salt and hydrogen peroxide which may help stop infections and heal the gums. You should buy a dental irrigator / water pik. If you can't afford that, just mix it all up in a small cup and brush your teeth with the mixture. The irrigator will really help though. <br>  <br>  This may help stave off an infection, but the best advice is to see a dentist as quickly as possible. Many dentists will accept a plan or monthly payments. I would explain the situation to a friendly dentist and see what can be done. Most will do an initial consultation for free.|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	yes that could cause problems like infection not to mention the pain tell him to leave it alone as it may fall out naturally without bacteria from hands and unsterilised tolls touching it! also use an antiseptic mouth wash you can get from drug store doesnt cost much the hole may heal over on its own! antiseptic mouthwash will stop any infection and promote healing!!! hope this helps :)

It contains large amounts of<br>  catechins, a group of antioxidants polyphenol flavonoids<br>  with strong anti-cancer properties, and the tea has also been found to provide protection against oesophageal cancer and to block the formation of tumours arising in the<br>  skin, lungs, digestive tract, liver and breasts. In addiction, it was found to reduce cholestrol levels and lower blood pressure, and it has claimed to fight colds and flu and prevent gum disease, dental cavities and bad breath.|`|UbDwxcoLaa	sometimes. water flushes out the toxins in ur body and cleans organs....green tea does the same but is really used for colds, disease those things.|`|CqqH12I8aa	nothing's healthier than water.|`|4Zd1cQXaaa	Green tea is a new fad drink, and it seems to be like every company is putting it in their products.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Run 5 miles a day.  It will work.|`|lEXTHOZPaa	Walking and jogging have been proven to be effective exercises to lose weight. They are both forms of cardiovascular exercises, not only do they get rid of fat, but also built stamina.<br>  But have you heard or tried walking in the swimming pool?. Water is a great source for workout, you feel light while the water pressure puts force to your body parts. This not only gets rid of fat, but each step you take is harder and utilizes more body muscles. So if you are obese or do not want to workout on land or at the gym, then walking in the pool is the best exercise for you. Try standing in the shallow end, and walking towards the deep end.

63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	I took Ballet from age 8 to age 19 and my nails looked terrible, our dancing teacher would send us to a man who cut the nails and would use a machine to sand off the tops of the nails when they overgrew. He was not a licensed doctor, and I suspect I got the fungus from his tools, I lived with it for maybe forty years, and then someone suggested that I use White vinegar and soak the nails in it at least once a day for 20 minutes. Now you cannot miss a day with this treatment, you see you have to stop the fungus from growing from the nail bed, if you miss even a day, it starts all over again. I used the vinegar as a bedtime routine, and did not go to bed without it no matter how tired I was. I also asked my doctor for and received a prescription for a antibiotic and took this, as I was doing the vinegar treatment, now some people use the same vinegar, over and over, but I was afraid it would lose it's effectiveness and I bought my vinegar in gallon jugs and used fresh every night. Now this did not do the job in a hurry, I am not going to lie to you, it took six moths, but now I can go barefoot at the beach. But remember if you start this you cannot do it, hit and miss. Every night without fail.|`|TUi2BBCraa	You can't make me click on those links, KIA.|`|wqL84O8Naa	First of all GROSS, second of all, that's not SEVERE toenail fungus and you can get a script real cheap from your doctor that will clear it up in less than a week|`|veXsp7v1aa	My cousin used to have a velcro toe nail.

This is alot of time and some don;t do the trick anyways.<br>  1st what type do you have is it Dermatophytes,, Molds or Yeasts?<br>  There are no simple ways to treat this no quick fixes out there any where so lets say we find our own treatments (for any one who has this). The nail becomes thick to protect this bug and does a good job at that so you will have to thin the nail by taking some off the top but do be careful file a small amount at a time then treat the toes as needed. Can apply tea-tree oils  soak in a vinegar  and water solution, try soaking in bleach water as well,soak in listerine  mouth wash, the best yet is salt water from the ocean great treatments..If can walk in the ocean at least 1 hour a day this will help alot.Sugar intake causes  yeast  and this may not help the toe problem but there are several ways to deal with this so try anything you believe may kill this bug. Try takeing Zinc every day Soak feet in warm corn meal.
cie2rINTaa	You will be contagious for at least 3 days after your symptoms have stopped. So, if you HAVE to go to school, please do your best not to infect other people.

Consistent ab workouts are great to strengthen the muscles of the stomach but will not completely help to make those muscles more evident.  <br>  <br>  You will see dramatic claims on T.V. about inches lost with their abdominal apparatus and you yourself may see some results with these machines but this is because it is forcing you into a cardiovascular workout.  Going from doing nothing to anything will improve your fat percentage to an extent and it is this factor that will help you make your abs visible.<br>  <br>  So instead of pulverizing your stomach everyday and risking potential injury from overtraining, limit your ab workouts to 3 times a week and shift the bulk of your energy towards more cardiovascular work.

So first of all start taking Advil instead.  The prognosis for your tooth is not good. Based on what you have described you will require either a root canal to save the tooth or have the tooth pulled.  You may be able to control the pain with Advil but it will not go away and will likely get much worse.  It needs to be treated.  I am sorry about the $ situation as treatment can be expensive.

iizKx4Bvaa	I have been married for ten years. I also am in the adult industry and  see alot of this. Men are visual creatures and as such w woman should stimulate that. Porn when it is being filmed is the non sexiest thing ever. It is so generic and believe it or not sometimes the people on the screen just met. I think they have a video on how porn is made every man should see this. Talk about a def-later. This should do it.lol. In the meantime I would try some tantric techniques snap a branch in two. Feel sexy act sexy exude sexy and he will think you are sexy. Porn is not the problem. Self esteem issues are. He is actually trying to get something he does not currently have. This to me is not cheating at all. Porn can be a useful tool that has actually helped many a men. The girls on the videos are not that airbrushed either.

I collect twinks [the equivalent of the young women you are talking about -- 18-22 roughly, and sweet), although more artsy photos than hard core porn.  Jonathan collects both males and females.  This has zero effect on our sex life and certainly doesn't encourage either of us to cheat.<br>  Yes, we certainly love each other, with all our hearts, no we do not "sicken" each other -- and the thought would never have crossed my mind, but I am a fairly secure person.  It's just a  collection, so no, I do not love it more than my beloved, and I certainly don't feel guilty about it.  Then again, I think sex in general is a GOOD thing.  <br>  <br>  I think you are greatly over reacting because you on the other hand do not REALLY think sex is a good thing, and because you have self-image issues.<br>  <br>  Believe in yourself, your lover and your relationship -- everything will be fine.<br>  <br>  Kind thoughts,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|VPkuM2xWaa	I watch it daily.<br>  He is looking at the foo foo not the Woman. lol|`|A2G9foewaa	he probably isn't aware that is affecting your intimacy, you should talk to him about that<br>  <br>  looking at other women will not cause someone to cheat<br>  <br>  you can still love someone, and love porn<br>  <br>  no looking at my wife does not sicken me, after i look at porn<br>  <br>  no i do not love porn than my partner, i cut back looking at porn at her request maybe he will do the same for you|`|L3ucoaNIaa	...

This kind of addiction does mess with a person's ability to be intimate.  I mean, I love people, but I'm learning how to be close to someone without my mind jumping to the physical aspects.  He does need help, and admitting that he has an addiction is the first step to overcoming it, so don't give up on him.  If you've told him that it really bothers you, he probably does feel guilty.  Or at least hopefully he does.  I know I do.  But it's the high and the risk that he's probably hooked on.

yHHdAMnQaa	Of course.. you can deferentially have both... a lot of people have both|`|pWl7SHjTaa	yes you can. It's pretty typical if someone suffers from one disorder, they often are diagnosed with a second (or even a third) because symptomology of the two are so similar that they overlap. Ocassionally, it is the attempt to treat one disorder that causes the onset of the second (because of the drastic changes in neurotransmitters in the brain due to medications and lifestyle changes that are part of treatment, it triggers something else in the brain- it's not anyone's fault, not yours or your doctor's - it just occurs sometimes and although precautions against it are taken, it still occurs). schizophrenia is thought to be genetic in origin, with a trigger at some point in life (could be extreme stress or a traumatic event) that causes the disorder to appear, although sometimes there isn't really a trigger and it just starts to express itself. the typical age it does this is during the late teens or early twenties. there is some indication that the neurotransmitter serotonin plays a part (elevated levels in the brains of those with Schizophrenia). If you are on an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), it may have caused serotonin levels to increase past the threshold, but likely not, since they only really bring levels to normal, not an extreme high. But yes, it isn't abnormal to have more than one disorder. just listen to your psychiatrist, take meds as prescribed.

Just punch the air, moving forwards like a boxer, with the correct footing and with the right punches. if you have a punching bag its even better, or you can punch the sofa. you'll get better at punching, and most people dont mess with people who can punch them in the face, and hurt them really bad. <br>  <br>  do push-ups(like 10x4 to start) <br>  depending on how much spare time you have. <br>  you can buy a protein drink, and join a gym or buy a couple dumbells or a barbell. 5kg-10kg is a good starter weight. buy the one you can only do 6 reps with. <br>  if you can buy weights, find something heavy and pick it up(like the sofa, hold one side, bend knees, then use your whole body to lift it up) <br>  running is also good. do a few sprints. you dont really need a very large area. 30 metres is good enough. 400m sprints if you have that sort of area. <br>  exercise 6 days a week, and shadow box 6 days a week. <br>  push-ups 10x4<br>  squats 10x10<br>  sit-ups 10x4<br>  running(whatever you can)<br>  shadow boxing 5-30minutes (your fore arms will be really sore, punch hard, and fast, your triceps/biceps/back/shoulders will be sore by the time you start forgetting about the pain in the forearms)<br>  <br>  bicep curls 6x4(or how ever many you can do, if you can buy weights, use something heavy, like a vase? or a bucket of water?) <br>  romanian deadlifts(use the sofa if you didnt get weights.)<br>  <br>  <br>  also when someone tries to mess with you, look at them like you wont stop till youve torn peices out of them.<br>  If your going to get violent, start of strong(punch them in the nose? kick em in the balls, elbow them in the gut.)<br>  act like your strong, if you act weak, youll attract trouble.|`|LywVUxsTaa	Have you considered taking marial arts classes?  I think that might be very helpful to you.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	start doing some strength training. you don't even need to buy anything. do pushups, use cans as weights (i know it sounds silly, but you can do this until you can buy some real weights). start building some muscle. do cardio. maybe you could look up some "how to do martial arts" or something like that on youtube.<br>  save up for those martial arts classes|`|DQ1CCOazaa	My advice to you, get a gym membership or invest money into a home gym. I was always small my whole life but i never took **** from anyone. I'm still relatively small, but I am a lot stronger than most people i know, big or small. This really helps when people try and start stuff with me because i know i can beat the **** out of them. I plan on going into criminal justice after i graduate high school, then becoming a cop also.<br>  <br>  My advice for getting stronger without any heavy equipment would buy the Iron Gym pullup bar. Its great because you can work a lot of your main muscles on it. After about 2 months with it, plus i go to the gym everyday, i can do 35 wide grip pull ups. <br>  <br>  You want to work your main muscles to look and be stronger. The easiest way to work your chest would be to do Pushups, a lot of them. When i work my chest i usually do about 50 pushups throughout the day with my normal chest routine. Start at 50 and generally increase throughout your training. For back and shoulders, wide grip pull ups are by far the best for it. They are extremely hard when you first try them but keep at it and you will get stronger. For your triceps, tricep dips are very good. You should be able to do quite a lot of these and they really help your muscle develop. For biceps, do chin ups, These will work your lats as well but this will help you get that "jacked" look if you do it right. <br>  <br>  Its not always about what exercises you do, its about what you eat. Pay attention to your protein intake. For gaining weight and building muscle, you will want 1g of protein for each lb you weigh. Ex- 135 lbs=135g of protein. This is extremely important for gaining muscle.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|x7gLAGFCaa	what worked for me is pole dancing - i stated to pole dance 2 years ago after i had my baby and since then i  lost all the baby fat and my body got really tuned.<br>  if you want their is a site that tells you all about it - they have allot of info about the pole dancing and you can even buy a pole through them.<br>  if you don't have money you can learn the basic moves without a pole<br>  and after you get one you will be able to practice more.<br>  hope this helps.<br>  d<br>  <br>  the site is: www.thestripperpole.com

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.<br>   Side Lunge Slide<br>  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.<br>  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot to the side, torso<br>  upright and abs in. Slowly slide left foot back to starting position,<br>  repeating 8-12 times. Switch legs and repeat for 2-3 sets.<br>  <br>  Lunge Slide<br>  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.<br>  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot back into a lunge<br>  position, keeping the right knee behind the toe, torso upright and abs<br>  in. Slowly slide left foot back to starting position and repeat 8-12<br>  times. Switch legs and repeat on each leg for 2-3 sets.<br>  <br>  Front One-Legged Squat<br>  Stand on a step or small platform. Lift left leg out in front of step<br>  and bend the right leg, bringing the toe of the left foot to the<br>  floor. Touch the floor lightly and keep the knee of the bent leg in<br>  line with toes.

It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|1pup885baa	You've got a great start if you're already running once a week. It sounds like you've hit a plateau, though... your body has gotten used to your level of exercise and you can't lose weight. To lose weight, just do more of what you're already doing - go running 3 or 4 times a week instead of just one (or get some other form of cardio... biking or using an elliptical are both fun and effective). Try to work some strength training into your workout. Do crunches, pushups, squats, use weights if you have them, etc. As long as your diet stays healthy, you should start losing weight :)|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions

tEcnEFXmaa	Hi, I am actually on it right now as we speak. This is day number 4 for me. I have lost 2 pounds but I'm not done yet. I also go to the gym and work out hard so that I can get on track with toning up at the same time. If you're trying to loose weight monitor how much syrup you use because that is actually where the calories come from. Do the math and you'll see the total calories as well as carbs that you'll consume while on the mix. I've cut back on the syrup just a little. My skin has definitely cleared up (not that it was bad) I noticed a difference in it. May be because I'm getting rid of toxins in my body. I'm going for 14 days but can't stand the yucky salt water! After that is out of the way everything else is a breeze. Good luck let me know how everything works out!|`|CXwjdUgDaa	acai is BS every diet plan out there claiming to make you lose weight is BS. only thing that can make you lose weight is staying away from junk food and having a nice clean well balanced diet with lean protein and lots of fruits and veggies and a good 4-5 days in the gym|`|ZvKSwVX6aa	The master cleanse diet is more about cleansing the body than losing weight.

hWc65sEtaa	In a way.  It will make that bone weaker the older you get.  When you get old, it has a better chance of breaking again.|`|AA11707529	the word "brake" means to put the brake on, like in a car. You mean the word "break" as in snapping or opening something. A healed broken bone may or may not affect you. It depends on where the break occurred, how old you were at the time, and how severe the break was. Also, whether or not you did  bone-strengthening exercises later on.Strengthening exercises include lifting weights, and walking.<br>  <br>  For the severity -- was it set with regular surgery, or did it need screws and plaits to put the bone[s] back together.  Even though healed, such a break can cause problems later in life --- maybe. Just take care of yourself.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	how do you brake a bone? say "whoa bone.

vwTu8fY7aa	Drinking a lot of water is good way to digest food much quicker. Once u start drinking a lot of water go to the gym and lose the water weight. <br>  <br>  Water weight is much easier to lose because the more that u sweat the more that u lose and drinking water makes u sweat a lot more when u work out.<br>  <br>  U should also swim people think that u dont sweat when u swim but u do and try running on a treadmill for a mile and bike for two miles.|`|qZOuxR1Raa	It sound like you already know how to keep a good diet and exercise. Don't cut out ALL sweets and oils because after you start craving them sooooo much that when you start eating them again eventually (you can't go your whole life without sweets!) you pig out on them. My best advice would be to eat smaller portions. Eat whatever you want but minimize it. Instead of a medium coke, get a small, instead of hamburger n fries, have either the burger or the fries. Running is the best exercise and crunches work but only for our abs. Try something that tones your whole body. And try riding a bike, it's fun and healthy. Also try to keep yourself busy with other things that will keep your mind off food. Good luck !|`|nZxIVProaa	k. try...<br>   the wall squat (tones legs, buttocks, and also abs):<br>  1. Stand with your back toward a wall and place a stability ball between your back and wall. The ball is pressed between your lower back and the wall. <br>  2. Your feet should be placed about shoulder-width apart. <br>  3. You can place your hands on your hips for balancing purpose. <br>  4. Bend your knees, keeping your core muscles tight. Lower your body so that your thighs are just parallel to the floor (ninety-degree angle at the knee joint). <br>  5. Hold the position for few seconds. <br>  6. Still keeping your back pressed into the ball, return to the starting position. Push through your heels to drive your body back to the starting position. <br>  7. Do 2 to 3 sets with about 8 to 12 repetitions each set. <br>  <br>  also...try the front dumbell raise (tones the arms...duh):<br>  1. Stand with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing backward. <br>  2. Keep your abdominal muscles tight and knees bent. The feet should be about shoulder width apart. <br>  3. Maintain a slight bend in your elbows throughout the exercise so that your arms are straight, but not locked at the elbow. <br>  4. Lift the weight in your left hand in front of you with your arm parallel to the floor and at shoulder level. <br>  5. If possible, pause at the top of the movement. <br>  6. Then slowly return to the start position and repeat with the opposite arm.<br>  <br>  hope this helped!
U1chPjvPaa	Cancer can strike anyone, whether you have ever smoked or not.  <br>  Smoking ups your chances of getting cancer, heart disease, bad circulation, emphysema, COPD, and probley even more stuff that can kill you just as dead as cancer.  <br>  <br>  If you are only smoking without being totally addicted  to it, I would suggest you stop now and never light up again.  <br>  My smoking caused emphysema and I have also had heart problems.  They fixed my heart, luckily, but the emphysema will be with me forever.   I wish I had never started smoking of course, but I hve not smoked for 3 years now.|`|6tv7vZelaa	That's one of the odd things about smoking...one person can smoke packs and packs and never be effected, while another person smokes only a few cigarettes a month and end up with cancer.  Odd...still, I'm thinking that smoking a pack over a long period would definitely reduce the chance of cancer...like you said, your body would have time to flush out the bad chemicals.|`|vWm1l9nuaa	There is no lower limit as to when smoking is without risk. But if you stop smoking completely the risk of developing cancer will decrease as time goes by. It is estimated that around 10 years after you quit smoking the cancer risk will be about the same as for non-smokers|`|KiqjuCVvaa	You should never smoke!!!!!!!!!! It can kill you! Who would want to smoke anyway? It gives you bad breath, yellow teeth, wrinkles, and ugly hair.|`|0a09nf4taa	Either way, you are highing your risks for getting cancer, it doesn't matter how much you smoke.
4cEIK8pnaa	In my past experiences women GYN's are just not as careful. They seem to have the "I am a women and I know what this feels like" attitude and don't take the time to walk you through what they are doing and definatly don't take the extra care that the men GYN's that I have seen do. The men seem to be more careful and gentle since they have no idea what it is like.<br>  Just my opinion on what I have been through. Hope this helps.<br>  Also, when I was younger I refused to have a male do it because it was uncomfortable with it. That changed with age. I would NOT have a female now if I had to. :)|`|VJqDtuoPaa	have male Gyn's all my life. My current one is hilarious. Had him for 4 years now on my first visit he made the joke...You cant find a cervix that looks this good in the store. I didnt know how to react at first but he was doing it to get me to relax. I was so bent on trying to figure out what the hell he was talking about he was in and out in no time. We have a great doctor patient relationship. I know I can ask him anything. And one benefit I like about having a male...you can ask all those embarrassing guy questions you have about your guy. LOL|`|vttIwDWzaa	it would just be if you were more comfortable having a guy as ur GYN or a female.|`|PxohEvTvaa	Oh my gosh.. No!!<br>  I dont barely feel comfortable with a lady touching me let alone a man.!!|`|UBxKqdPwaa	My philosophy on this is a question.  Why are you paying for a doctor?  I pay for their brains and knowledge not for their bodies.  I had 5 children and all doctors were men.  There were few women doctors in those days.  I have also heard horror stories about some of the women being rough and uncaring. Please choose your doctor on reputation, knowledge and ability in his/her field.|`|8iYVHA1raa	Never bothered me - A Doctor is a Doctor, they've seen it all. My biggest concern is that they are good at what they do, not their gender.|`|FZE4bK0haa	its totally fine... its really no big deal... its his job to do what he does, its not like he's seducing you lol... oh and dont be nervous about going to the gyn, its not that scary|`|WLLqdPXeaa	NO,it is impossible.|`|oQcDZI9Daa	I don't think I would EVER be comfortable with a male gyn.  <br>  Some people just don't belong certain places...|`|vD5ucs24aa	My GYN is a male, it doesnt bother me. i have been going to him for over 10 yrs
KqxQlPrNaa	Yes, any changes in the breasts are normal.  The lightening color probably is due to one hormone level increasing and another (the one that caused the darker color) is decreasing.
25Whzu2waa	SHUDDUP FAKE BLOGGER.<br>  <br>  Anyways, man, this is what you do. You should bench at least 2-3 times a week, so basically every time you go there (with at least one day of rest in between). Everytime you bench, do 5x5 (5 reps, 5 sets) and increase it by 2.5lbs on each side (5lbs total) every time you do. That's around a 2.3kg addition everytime.<br>  <br>  Don't try to force it any faster than that. If you keep it up like that, you'll reach your goal soon enough. I'd estimate . . . around 3 months, if kept consistent. Don't give up!|`|UbDwxcoLaa	it doesn't matter.. the  more you do, the more u get used to it and the more u can bench.|`|188b0ae34eb786fb169cb1c0663e560baa	I can't lift weights worth a damn.

xmibEEdcaa	Is she on Tegretol, Neurontin, or another anti-convulsant for the TN?  If so, then that's probably what's doing it to her, more than the TN itself. Those drugs are *notorious* for wreaking holy havoc with ones memory.  Check out any trigeminal neuralgia support group online, and you'll see lots of people complaining and commiserating with each other about the memory loss and "brain fog" caused by these drugs.<br>  <br>  I also have TN, and I've been having terrible memory problems as well, especially now that I've had to go to a higher dose to control the pain. I also feel "dumbed down" a lot of the time, which is scary and frustrating, like I've suddenly stumbled into the lead role of "Flowers For Algernon."  Brrrrr. <br>  <br>  What's helped me a lot is to start keeping one of those Day Runner type notebooks (the kind with not only weekly and monthly calendar sheets, but also phone/address and "note" sheets in it) on me at all times, and to write *everything* down in it promptly -- even things I think I'll be able to remember.  It makes me feel a little silly sometimes, since I've been out of work and so don't really feel like I should need one of these big old yuppified corporate day planners, but it's really been a lifesaver for me.<br>  <br>  Your wife could probably also use a lot of emotional support. The 'dumbing down' effect can be really morale-destroying, even worse in some ways than the pain.  But I'm sure you know that. :)|`|ZqIGTiMOaa	Always keep a notebook and pen handy for her, even tie pen to book.I forget little things daily, i find keeping notes helps.

MhpccWpmaa	This could definitely still be a yeast infection.  I don't understand why they would give you Metronidazole (if that's what you meant) because that's usually for bacterial infections.  Taking that medication usually GIVES you a yeast infection. (I've had to take it before, trust me).  What they should've prescribed for you was a pill called Diflucan.  It's one pill you take that usually works wonders at getting rid of yeast infections.  Even though it's only one pill it usually takes about a week to completely knock the infection out of your body at which time you should not have sex.  At home treatments never work for me, but Diflucan always has.  Go back to the doctors and give this a try|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Wear lose pants, eat yogurt and go to the health food store and get Multidophilus 12, (Solaray is the brand I use) It's to rebuild the microorganisms that should live in your body. Candid Albacans (spelling?) can cause yeast infections so try fixing up your intestines and this could help. Do that for about a week. The people who work at health food stores are very knowledgeable (sometimes more than MD's, so talk to a female there and she'll help you. <br>  <br>  Feel better. and don't have sex while you have this.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Diflucan does help many, but not me. That's why they make so many different meds.

xdo49r2iaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  You  can increase the size of your breast .To make your boobs bigger . You can try natural breast enlargment methods . Details are as under<br>  <br>  Breast massage as a method of natural breast enlargement and breast health has actually been used for years as a means of stimulating healthy breast growth and promoting breast tone, pliability and firmness.<br>  <br>  Here are some guidelines for breast massage you may want to follow:<br>  <br>  1.) Use a olive oil or any other oil of your choice to help prevent friction and increase the enjoyment and relaxation of the massage for a more pleasurable and therapeutic experience. This can be an herbal mixture .<br>  <br>  2.) Light to moderate massaging using a gentle back and forth gentle “swishing” action is best. This can be in a counterclockwise circle around the breast to help promote maximum lymphatic drainage.<br>  <br>  3.) To gain maximum benefit and therapeutic effects, breast massage should be practiced daily, as part of a routine - perhaps when fresh out of the shower, since the skin is still somewhat moist and the room may still be steamy, for a smoother massage which may be more easily lubricated since there will still be moisture in the air. If you prefer, even several times a day can be a great benefit. It depends on what fits into your schedule. A few minutes at a time should suffice.<br>  <br>  .<br>  <br>  Enjoy Life|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Why? They're YOUR boobs.|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	You have to gain weight, or gain some fat all over.

FLAtdWrmaa	All sorts of things, including bits of the placenta still inside the uterus, causing problems;  and hormone levels all over the place and changing around -- which usually settles down after a few weeks (at most).<br>  <br>  What caused the miscarriage?  That could be relevant, if it's known.<br>  <br>  If the spotting is as heavy as your normal periods, or heavier, or doesn't stop after a day or two, then see a doctor IMMEDIATELY!!
rJgrwIodaa	I prefer cardio first because it gets your blood pumping.  If you lift weights cold, it can be hard on your muscles.  Also, if you do isolation weight training, your body tells your brain to start pumping blood to, let's say, your arms first.  Then you start doing sit-ups, and your brain is trying to switch gears, but can't catch up.  So your arms are getting all your blood, but you're using your abs.  Then, you go for a run.  About now, your body is sending blood to your abs because it's finally caught up.  Then you get a cramp because you're running and your abs are getting pumped with fresh blood.  Your legs aren't getting any yet, because your brain is still a step behind, so you're a little sluggish.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, I think it's better to do cardio and weight training on separate days.  Alternate every day, then take a full day off from everything because rest is just as important as training.  It allows your muscles to heal.  If you were to skip rest days, your muscles would eventually be overwhelmed and you will get an injury.  Hope this helps!|`|wIpkGuRhaa	weight training then cardio it will give you a better weight lifting session<br>  <br>  <br>  look under the exercise part in this article itll tell you a little more<br>  <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/beach_body_prep.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/beach_bo...</a>|`|yvdxzQDsaa	warm up 10 minutes with cardio then weight training then cardio fo 15 minutes|`|h9RCLfgWaa	high intensity cardio on a different day than ur weight lifting.|`|WFP46Ek9aa	i gave u my email for your question<br>  u can call me too

Where is your willpower?<br>  Work on that skill please, respect yourself in this manner of not smoking.<br>  To explain the cuts, well if the skin is tight, dry, it can be cut easily by the teeth, and in your sleep you could have easily done that.<br>  This is fairly common, simply moisturize the lips, the bleeding is nothing to worry about (Unless you are going out) the bleeding will stop swiftly as it is just the blood vessels in the skin in which does not matter, as you will not bleed and bleed, just be careful as infection can still be introduced, and smoking is not good combined.|`|n7BuH75gaa	No, not that I know of.

Fungal infections are the most common, but viral or bacterial infections can also occur.<br>  Nutritional deficiency of vitamin B.<br>  Over-closure of the mouth in someone who has been without teeth or dentures for some time.<br>  In young children, the cracks and splits often begin with lip-licking, biting the corners of the mouth, or thumb-sucking.<br>  <br>  i doubt it has to do with smoking, unless you've been smoking for years and years (idk have you?) because then its up in the air|`|yLOsXWmnaa	It can come from that and being dehydrated.

GBC39wHAaa	As for the anti-TPO (AMA) and anti-TG (ATA) antibodies, they themselves are not thought to cause m/c. If they cause thyroid damage, hyper or hypothyroidism can result and affect fertility and cause m/c. There are some studies that suggest that elevated AMA/ATA are related to elevated NK cells which DO cause m/c or implantation failure. Treatment for NK is IVIg (intravenous immune globlulin) IF there is good response to IVIg during NK testing. You would need a full NK panel through a reproductive immunology lab to see what the response is. If the response is less than optimal, then some doctors add Humira or Enbrel to the treatment. The "low tech" treatment of AMA/ATA is oral Selenium supplements. Some docs suggest 50 mg/day and others go as high as 200 mg a day. The "low tech" treatment of NK is fish oil capsules. Depending on the brand and concentration, 720 mg of EPA (on of the oils that is thought to help with NK) is recommended.
6ypXMb1jaa	My fiance had something similar to this; up and down fevers, sore throat and feeling like he had a cold or flu and it simply would not go away. After much convincing on my part, he went to the doctor who immediately sent him to the ER. <br>  <br>  At the ER, he was diagnosed with DKA, or diabetic ketoacidosis. My fiance had no idea he had diabetes, no idea he was near death. He spent 4 days in ICU and came home the day after Valentine's Day. He's doing much better now that he is getting his diabetes in check after entering the ER with a blood glucose level of 774. (That is stroke or death level, NOTHING to toy with!)<br>  <br>  You should go to the doctor. No one can properly diagnose you over the internet. It could be bronchitis, or pneumonia or something worse. Please see a doctor in case it is life-threatening. Good Luck.

IyyAiFBmaa	What to Eat?<br>  - Take healthy snacks like channa murmura with a few raisins, muesli, fruits, dhokla, khandvi, roasted grains or idli.<br>  - Take a small measure of raw sprouts, 5 almonds, 1 fig daily.<br>  - Have a glass of tomato+carrot+beetroot juice daily as this complete health cocktail will ensure that you get lots of antioxidants which will increase the body immunity and help repair cell damage.<br>  - If you have a sweet tooth, eat natural sweet like figs, prunes, raisins.<br>  <br>  What NOT to Eat?<br>  - Avoid large and heavy meals as they tend to make you full resulting in you feeling a bit sleepy.<br>  - Avoid junk food as they increase the insulin rush which result in restlessness, rapid heart rate and inability to concentrate.

You get less than 9 periods a year and it's hard to get pregnant. I've been with my boyfriend for 8 year and I'm currently 5 months pregnant. It's REALLY hard for me to have a baby! Get this checked though. You might have it too if you're not regular.

AA11349803	This depends on the contract the dentist signed with the insurance companies. Generally speaking, you cannot charge the patient any more than the lower contracted fee, less the other company's payment.<br>  <br>  Since the dentist is contracted with both companies, they would not be allowed to charge more than $700 for the onlay (assuming you had only one plan). It should not make a difference if you have another plan which allows the dentist to charge $1000; YOU are not obligated to pay more than your co-payment on the lowest contracted fee.<br>  <br>  If you have any doubts, call the secondary company and ask what the dentist may collect from you up front.|`|8iYVHA1raa	You have to base it on the primary insurance|`|0d9b657fe19e5aa8e1634e830acde7a4aa	I would say it would be based on the primary ins. plan, which for you, would be yours through your employer.

FX4wYtX0aa	Diet soda is sweetened artificially and our body can't break it down as fast. You're better off drinking 1 watered down soda a day. As women, we have a tendency to carry excess fat on our adominal and thigh area (go us!), so while the sweetners are waiting to be broken down, they're converted into fat and stored very firmly around the adominal area. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to give up your carbonated drink, what you can do is try carbonated water with some juice.

a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	~150 calories for the beef<br>  ~50 calories for the cheese<br>  ~40 calories for the sour cream(assuming you used a measuring spoon)<br>  ~40 for all the vegetables<br>  <br>  so 280<br>  <br>  See step 4 below for future meals...<br>  <br>  Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to: <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum and is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat (equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bar(awesome snack, 150 calories, 10g of protein! 3g fiber you can not do better, also comes in Peanut Butter and Chocolate), Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle).<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snack or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Smaller but more. Each smaller snacks more often instead of big meals. This really does work and will definately increase your metabolism. I eat a South Beach Cereal Bar every 2 hours all day then a good dinner. They keep me full and they taste pretty good. Caffiene is your friend. It is a natural appetite suppressant so have that cup of coffee!<br>  <br>  Step 7: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 8(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 9: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 10: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that will distract you for a half an hour so that your w

IMPvzBk1aa	Ear pain, a feeling of fullness in the ear, and loss of hearing are all symptoms.  Infections of the external ear canal, before the eardrum, are called swimmer's ear and can occur when water stagnates in the canal, or from sticking things into the canal.<br>  Middle ear infections occur behind the eardrum in the middle ear cavity, and can be caused by blowing your nose too hard so nasal mucus backs up through the eustachian tube.  This tube connects the middle ear with the nasal cavity.  It is normally collapsed, and only opens when pressure within the ear needs to be balanced with atmospheric pressure.  When your ears "pop", the eustachian tubes open.  So, when you have a cold, leave one nostril open as you evacuate mucus from the other, or you may cause a middle ear infection (otitis media).|`|5X5PrWR6aa	ear infections can be viral (caused by a virus), bacterial (caused by Bacteria built up in the ear).or If you have allergy symptoms your ear tubes may not be draining and you need a decongestant. If your ear infection has a fever or is getting worse and not better then you probably need an oral antibiotic.<br>  <br>  Generally, the first symptom is searing ear pain. If you take hold of the cartilage of your upper ear and give it a little tug it hurts very much, that's an outer ear infection, commonly called "swimmers' ear", and you can treat that at home. (Just supportive care - like Motrin for pain, and swimmers' ear drops.) <br>   If your ear hurts so much you want to jam something into the side of your head, and you might or might not have a fever, it's probably a middle ear infection. Take some Motrin or Advil for pain and if you have a heating pad, put it on low and rest that side of your head on it. <br>  <br>  If they gave you topical antibiotic drops then the infection may be localized to the drum or external canal though some drops absorb well through the drum.<br>  <br>  If the doc thinks it may be viral then Tylenol for the pain combined with ear drops.<br>  <br>  Some people use warm (to body temperature) clove oil drops in the ear as a pain reliever. They should not be used at the same time as the antibiotic drops.<br>  I hope that helps :)|`|07c9c8887a2079668fc6b70291da5a98aa	well a doctor is your best bet but you can feel it by a popping feel in your ear like bubbles.  Also if it starts to hurt a lot for more then 24 to 48 hours internally it most likely is.  The bacteria that is in dirty water is the most common called swimmers ear is bacteria that is the bad kind we all have some amount of bacteria but sometimes it is to much or to bad and it becomes an infection to attack the bad antibodies aka bacteria.  Most ear infections can be taken care of by ear drops and time.

xRQAsGRAaa	I've been on Adderall XR since I was 14, I'm 19 now. I used to go through the same thing you do(weight loss). <br>  The only way to get around it is to force yourself to eat more. I know it sucks, and I know it's not enjoyable, but it's the only way. You CAN eat more than you already do, you just have to get some self control.<br>  <br>  Edit: There is one product I've heard of that a lot of bodybuilders use to gain weight fast. It's called Black Hole. It makes you incredibly hungry. If you feel like there is absolutely no way you can force yourself to eat more on your own, then I would give it a try.

9pLI73pqaa	Try vitamin e oil. It has been known to reduce scars and will aid healing.|`|yE2vM76naa	I would stick to neosporin if you feel the need to keep something on there to kill germs. Besides, the neosporin keeps the wound lubricated, which makes it easier for the body to produce skin cells, thus reducing the chances of scarring.<br>  <br>  Plus, I've found honey to be drying when left on healthy skin, I wouldn't want it to dry the edges of the wound and have you end up with a scar potentially.|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  You probably shouldn't.

dpgXzMenaa	It means that the tissue of the hymen has been changed (usually to a more "white" colour and a softer and stretchier texture) by the presence of estrogen during puberty (or from its presence due to the application of estrogen creams).   The individual in question is probably a girl of 9 to 14 years of age or older... but this condition is sometimes present in neonates due to elevated maternal estrogen levels pre-term.|`|6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	It means that the hymen was at one time damaged and then healed.

If it is an infection, you will find it does not clear up on its own, but may appear to improve only to recurr every so often.<br>  In the meantime drink plenty of fluids which helps flush through and should help relieve the pain.<br>  It could be Cystitis, which is similar but some people can be very prone to it.<br>  Your GP can sort this out quite easily for you.

b959c1bacc75d8acf50a00e99fc88981aa	Clenbuterol is a treatment for asthma. (The 'hydrochloride' form of a chemical is often the most easily digested.)<br>  <br>  Unless your husband suffers from asthma, he SHOULD NOT take it.<br>  <br>  It is a banned substance in competitive sports that have a 'doping policy', and taking it while training to compete, or in competition, can be described as cheating.<br>  <br>  The problems you describe can easily be caused by restrictive diet, or the wrong type of training programme, so you should not assume that they are the result of some of these pills. (Different medications can also combine to cause problems even if each drug dose is safe.) The problem may simply be 'overtraining' (not allowing enough 'recovery time' between workouts).<br>  <br>  Relaxation, and especially sleep, is absolutely NECESSARY for proper physical development. Even if the restlessness is caused by his 'focussed' attitude, or by the severity of his training, it means that any gains he makes will be counterproductive. <br>  <br>  The symptoms might also be caused by an underlying health problem that is being 'masked' by his exertion and his dietary restrictions. The behaviour you describe is bad for health, and will not be beneficial to fitness in the longer term. (A raised resting heart rate suggests that his fitness isn't improving in the shorter term either.)
74e542f00dc27cdbe7595f52050a58a7aa	The first guess is that you are burning your candle at both ends, or you are going through a lot of stress. You didn't say how long this has been going on. Look back and see if you can narrow it down and try to remember if anything significant happened around then (stress). If you can't remember you may have some vitamin that needs a little boosting. It would be best if you check with a doctor before you start any suplement. If this keeps up for any more than just a few more days I would consider the doctor. He can do blood tests and see what you are missing, if anything.pp|`|OJe4wKMDaa	Try magnesium-I have the same problem and I have read magnesium deficiencies can contribute. Try to get a good vitamin that is bound to something your body can actually process so you are actually getting the benefits (I use Melaleuca, but you have to be a member and a lot of people don't like to)<br>   I have always been sensitive to noise but it is bearable most of  the time. I notice I have more "attacks" as I get older, exactly as you described with noise and light. When I get worn down, that is when it makes me feel really panicky.<br>   I seem to have a hard time when there is more than one kind of noise-like I'm in the car, the radio is on, my kids are playing in the back and my husband is trying to talk to me. As if my brain can't separate the sounds like other people. I have read that this is indicative of ADD, fibromyalgia and bi-polarism. Since I day dream a bit excessively,and none of the other symptoms of the other conditions fit me at all, I think I may have slight ADD, which I guess I will eventually check out when I have health insurance again. In the meantime, I am going to be more diligent about taking my vitamins and buy some noise canceling headphones on ebay.

AA10003191	"After an incubation period of 14-21 days, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (post cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pains, headache and conjunctivitis.[3] The swollen glands or lymph nodes can persist for up to a week and the fever rarely rises above 38 oC (100.4 oF). The rash disappears after a few days with no staining or peeling of the skin. Forchheimer's sign occurs in 20% of cases, and is characterized by small, red papules on the area of the soft palate."

It is very routine ans only takes the surgeon about 20 minutes. I was back to work in 2 weeks. You do need to get this checked out as if it is a hernia then they can in rare occasions twist or as a Dr would call it strangulate. Other than this they are not generally dangerous. They are an injury not a illness.

There is nothing you can do except try very hard not to spread it to other parts of you like your eyes (really bad), nose, genitals, or any opening.

855fc218880a34479886ce4e939ad8dbaa	Cardio will help burn off much of the fat. I would stick to cardio for now, with lighter amount of lifting. Heavy lifting will increase your size and may make it difficult for you to go down in clothes sizes.<br>  <br>  As for the cardio, because of your weight, there may be problems on your knees and ankles if you plan on running. I would recommend swimming. It is wonderful exercise and is very kind on the joints. It works out all parts of your body and you will get the same results you find from lifting slightly. You will have to swim quite vigorously for quite some time though. Start off slowly, but eventually you want to be able to swim for at least an hour. You need in increase your base metabolism.<br>  <br>  For the future when you have lost weight, you might want to add some running to that. While swimming is wonderful, it does not really develop the bones as much. Your bones are not just sitting there. They are constantly breaking down and rebuilding themselves based on the way you move to optimize strength and durability. The more you walk around and put weight on your skeleton, the stronger your bones become. You don't want to overexercise because that will have problems on the joints if you do too much (also if you do too little - you really want to baby bear this and get it just right. Talk to someone seriously knowledgeable about this, and this is not your average personal trainer but someone who has studied this).<br>  <br>  Don't worry about spot exercises. If you want to remove visceral fat (that's the fat around the waist) you just have to do cardio and it will naturally be taken away from there. Sit ups and other ab workouts will not get the fat away from there. However, they are important too as they will develop those muscles there (so that when the fat is gone, it will look much nicer). <br>  <br>  Being overweight is hard on the body for exercise because unlike the fit person, you have to carry that extra weight- and that weight happens to be dead weight from fat, not extra muscle that could help you move better. But do not worry you can do it.<br>  <br>  I would recommend a balanced diet. Make sure you take in plenty of water and fiber. I cannot stress this enough. A good water intake will help you lose weight simply by clearing out your system of wastes better and by allowing your body to learn not to just store it. And seriously cut soda. This right here is a major source of weight gain in people. Soda has nothing good for you at all. Just get rid of it. I lost about 10lbs immediately after cutting all soda. I used to be a very big drinker. Water is the best thing you can drink. Even gatorade is not that good. It just replenishes some of the salt you might have lost during exercise but with very high sugar.<br>  Fiber is pretty much one of the best things you can have for losing weight. I have never tried the Metamucil fiber supplements , but they might help. Lentils are a wonderful source of protein and fiber. You should try having some lentil soup (I wish I could make you some now) with some toasted bread. Try it. If you don't like it, find a different recipe.<br>  Lastly, do not cut out all fat from your diet. Keep a little in there, but make sure they are in the form of non-saturated fats - like olive oil. Our bodies need fats. You might think "I've got a bunch on me right now," but that's very different. Our bodies are also designed to store and not use whatever is coming to us in scarce amounts. That's why we need to drink good amounts of water, so our body will learn to let it go. Fat is the same thing. Don't eat a lot, but do not cut it out of your diet or fat loss will become extremely difficult. The same goes for starving yourself.<br>  <br>  One side note, keep a good posture, sit up, and do not slouch down on the couch. I know it sounds weird, but this will help form your back and keep your body in line. It's something small but it does help.<br>  <br>  Anyways, good luck to you, and I hope for the best. This will take a lot of work but do not give up! And please do not fall for those "quick and easy" solutions you see on TV. Nothing worthwhile is "quick and easy."|`|SNVauR3laa	You should do both. Just get into it slowly if you haven't been working out. Cardio will help you lose fat, and lifting/strength training will help you build muscle. The new muscle will burn more calories throughout the day, making losing weight easier. Good luck!|`|Shp5riE6aa	Light cardio, you need to lose the fat before you can gain muscle back.  Swimming, walking and eating less is the best thing to do.  Drink plenty of water.|`|a531cd98fd2b70b96fa7a80f7571935eaa	I would lift light weights, get the heart rate up slowly then start with a  little cardio, a lot of people start off running first and quickly lose interest when they feel it is too much. Mark your calendar, take a supplement for a placebo effect, plan a good routine, lift light weights, so you dont get too sore and give up, and then after you feel pumped and better about yourself, then start witht the hard cardio.|`|2WfHLUyOaa	start with the cardio and as it gets easier gradually start the weights..it will work a treat....goodluck huni.|`|CCA0mTgsaa	they say a mix of all different types to work out everything|`|oojO4WAraa	Both.  More is better, but start slow and don't over do it.|`|AA11707529	If you are that overweight, start with walking, until you can do it without wheezing. Lifting weights is strength training, and for a more advanced workout... because weight lifting strengthens muscles, they will get strong underneath the fat, and you may not see any significant weight loss at all.<br>  <br>  Start out with walking. Once you've lost some weight, walk  faster. Then once you start using a gym, low resistance with a lot of reps burns fat. A lot of weight with fewer reps builds muscles, which you don't want till after you've lost weight. [And don't forget to modify your diet first.]|`|4uike3ARaa	Start with cardio. This far overweight, you should get checked out by a physician before you attempt anything strenuous. Weight lifting is fine for muscle development and toning, but the most important thing is to find an exercise that you actually enjoy doing, something you look forward to, something you're not likely to make an excuse to skip.<br>  Simply walking - not strolling, but walking - along with good diet will remove inches from your waistline. Take up racquetball. Lifting. Anything that you enjoy that burns calories.|`|NgnbtaORaa	Stick to cardio for now until you reach a weight closer to your ideal weight then you can start toning up your muscles otherwise you will just replace muscle where you have fat.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Diet is important in loosing weight.  It is a myth that not eating very much throughout the day slims you down - all that accomplishes is slowing down your metabolism and your body stores up those calories in fat.<br>  <br>  Eating Little, but OFTEN, throughout the day helps speed your body's metabolism up and therefore break fats down quicker and releasing, NOT STORING, more energy throughout the day. Four small balanced meals a day will lose you more weight than having only one, average to large, meal a day will, so bear that in mind.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Stay away from diet pills.  Diet pills are usually amphetamine based products and are very dangerous for your body.  They can lead to addiction as well as other physical, and mental, disorders over the period of use.|`|XxuyDt30aa	Please ignore HaloGuy<br>  <br>  Short answer is you should do both.  Also try the following.<br>  <br>  1. Eating cleaner(lean proteins such as skinless chicken breasts, turkey, fish and lean cut steak, cuts that have the words top or loin in them). Also eat 5-6 smaller meals a day. I eat half a turkey sandwich for lunch amd eat the rest a couple of hours later. I still eat the same amount but I spread it out.<br>  <br>  2. Strength training. try using free weights instead of machines and try doing compound exercises such as squats and lunges. These exercises not only target your lower body, but they also work other muscles, thus burning more fat and getting more bang for your buck. You should know that weight training not only burns fat but builds lean muscle, which in my opinion is the number 1 way to keep the weight off cause ti burns fat while youre not moving.<br>  <br>  3. Finally, start doing high intensity Interval training(HIIT) for your cardio. This has been proven to burn 9 times more fat that traditional cardio. It only takes 20 minutes ad works like this.<br>  minutes 1-2( work out at an easy pace, this is your warm up)<br>  minute 3 (workout at a moderate pace; 3.0 MPH on a treadmill or a level 4 resistance on a bike)<br>  minute 4 (workout at a hard pace; 5-6.0 MPH on a treadmill or a level 8-10 resistance on a bike)<br>  Complete the moderate and hard intervals until minute 18 then go to a cool down for miutes 19 and 20.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Do them both. You will burn fat and calories faster if you build some muscle. The scale might not go down as fast for a little while, because you are swapping the fat with muscle (the muscle will come easier than losing the fat, but will catch up eventually), but overall you'll lose the fat faster, and look better overall if you add strength training. Plus it'll make exercise, and moving around a whole lot easier.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Don't go only by the scale because it doesn't fully show the story of what's going on with your body, especially when you have so much weight to lose. Buy yourself measuring tape so that you can measure the inches around your waist, hips, and chest. It's possible to not lose any weight or gain a little but yet have smaller dimensions.|`|M5tqVX8Baa	you have to do both. and eat right. No junk food. Drink plenty of water and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. You can eat some chicken and fish and sprinkle a little lemon juice over it.

Cheers!|`|wGTisY1aaa	My workout routine<br>  I do a push pull workout on most days. 3 days a week i do strength training and the other 3 I do  65 minutes cardio moderate speed (3.5- 3.7)for walking on an incline of 1-2. For running, I run at a speed of 4.5-6 mph on an incline of 0-1, with 1 minute of warm-up before I run at 3.5 mph and for at least 5-10 minutes to cool down afterward. I stretch as well for approximately 5 minutes. I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal.

Also, there is a difference between doctors as to how one doctor may interpret findings and form clinical decision compared to another.  In a situation like this I would seek out a second opinion.  This will set your mind at ease.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Well, apparently someone didn't like my first answer.  So let me offer another they might like better.<br>  <br>  NO.  There is no way that a doctor can ever be wrong in their diagnosis.  All doctors are right all the time and you should never ever question your doctor.  You need to just put your concerns aside and blindly follow your doctor's advise even though your gut tells you there might be a problem.  Doctors are basically like God.  Do not doubt them.  There.

fAFXkikAaa	Herpes is very sneaky.   Either of you could have had it for years without any symptoms.   Further, if he has oral herpes (has ever had a cold sore) then he could have given you genital herpes through oral sex.   It is very VERY common for people to get herpes from someone who doesn't know that they have it.<br>  <br>  At this point, even if he were to test positive, if both of you have had previous partners, you likely will never know whether you GOT it from him, or GAVE it to him.<br>  <br>  Ulimately, it doesn't matter much.    He need to get tested - not to assign blame, but so that he knows whether or not he needs to protect future partners.<br>  <br>  Also, let me clear up a few things about some other answers.<br>  <br>  First, herpes is HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) not HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) and the symptoms are similar in both men and women.<br>  <br>  Second, condoms do not do a good job of protecting against herpes.   They are great for other diseases, but not so much for herpes.  <br>  <br>  If you want to learn more about genital herpes, I recommend the website below.  It's got good, easy to read, reliable information (unlike some answers here on Y!A).|`|HHyny0JSaa	Yes... herpes is the virus, the outbreak is the symptoms. But you can be a carrier for the virus without having any symptoms.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, it is possible. If he has herpes it can be passed even when there are no symptoms.|`|fk9AvB25aa	It's harder to pass when there are no symptoms but it's still possible. <br>  If he hasn't had any symptoms then how would he know that he has herpes. Herpes is symptomless most of the time until you have an out break. Many people who have herpes had no idea that they had it until they were diagnosed with it.|`|1663aacaf477ab5d8cb4705d60ab324faa	yes people can have herpes for years and not even know it!|`|3dbfb1686ea2a2772f3e03d47af16d08aa	yes, herpes is a virus and until sores appear it can be in his system.be safe us condoms|`|Nv4zY8Bbaa	Recognize the obvious symptoms. Although the signs of genital herpes are sometimes so mild that they are unnoticed, apparent signs of genital herpes include red bumps, sores or blisters on the genitals, anus, inner thighs or buttocks. <br>  <br>  Herpes are also recognizable by itching or pain in these areas. It is also important to know that blisters can occur inside the genitals, such as on the cervix for women and inside the urethra for men. <br>  <br>  Urination may be painful during an outbreak, or you may get flu-like symptoms including fever, headaches and muscle aches, or swollen lymph nodes in the groin.|`|MTYWXQaEaa	According to the TV advertising for prescription medication for the treatment of Herpes. A person infected With Herpes virus can transmit the virus to anyone whether they have active signs or not. Also another good source would be to ask your doctor. If he concurs, then I would have to insist that your friend have tests run by his doctor to be sure. You caught it from someone evidently.|`|295513eb67fcb3786fae8c19af3d1404aa	First, some corrections for answers let by well meaning people:<br>  <br>  1) "be safe us condoms" Yes, aways wear a condom. BUT a condom is only minimal protection against Herpes because Herpes is transmitted by surface contact (skin to skin) not by fluid transfer!<br>  <br>  2) "herpes is most contagious right before an outbreak" WRONG! Herpes is most most contagious while a person is 'SHEDDING'! There may be no visible or physical (or even emotional) sign of Herpes shedding! There is no 'requirement' to have an outbreak to be more contagious. Plus, what constitutes an 'outbreak' can differ person to person.<br>  <br>  3) "advertising for ... medication" should NEVER be taken at face value (heck, no advertising should). It does happen to be correct this time, but there are plenty of quack 'cures' for Herpes available. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now for your comment "I'm pretty sure he gave it to me, but he claims he has never had any symptoms of it."<br>  <br>  He could be lying, he could be telling the absolute truth. You could have had it for years and had some other trigger initiate an outbreak. Either of you may have had it orally and maybe transferred it.<br>  <br>  Get type tested. Wash your hands regularly. Keep Herpes out of your eyes. <br>  <br>  If you have issues dealing with it, search for an ASHA Help or Friends group in your area for support & social events.<br>  <br>  Remember that Cold Sores and Genetal Herpes are just some some virus humans can catch, they do not define who a person is.|`|NaCLfRDCaa	Some people may have no symptoms – but they can still spread herpes!

8iPRklxSaa	Hi  I found it worked for me. Managed to lose about 20 lbs quite quickly and kept it off. Didnt really change my diet too much either. I tried some of the other fad diets over the years but didnt really have much luck. I always had that horrible bloated feeling which I am pleased to say I lost after about a week.

hX1Qfs3qaa	Tampons are better a hundred per cent. <br>  <br>  Wearing a pad feels like wearing a diaper. Bleh.<br>  <br>  21|`|87756LlTaa	It's all personal preference.  I normally prefer tampons because they seem to be more sanitary for me.  However, my job prevents me from changing them as often as necessary, increasing the risk of toxic shock syndrome.  The chance of getting it is very low, but I'd rather avoid the risk, so I generally use pads these days.  <br>  <br>  Interesting question.  I'm 29.|`|OWVXKKLdaa	18, I used to use only pads but they really started to get uncomfortable especially since I'm a field hockey goalie. So before I came to college for pre-season I decided to finally try tampons. Oh my goodness, what a difference! I love them and I feel like if you understand how they work and are good with remembering to change them on time, etc. then they are the way to go. But for night, I'll use a pad sometimes, especially if I'm sleeping late... And pantyliners when I'm really light at the end of my period.|`|5LnteLsTaa	I'm 19, and am all for tampons.<br>  But I know a few of my friends hate them.  One says they're uncomfortable for her and another said it's because she feels "impure" with something in her... well, you know. <br>  I honestly don't think I could live without them, especially since I am a swimmer.  So it's pretty much a no-brainer for me.<br>  But there is nothing fundamentally wrong with using either tampons or pads.  It's all based on preference.|`|bc4a087960c91a42e0bbb5ed98d2eed0aa	Tampons work well, and make you feel cleaner, however, you have to keep them changed often, b/c toxic shock syndrome is a threat if not used properly. There are warnings on the packages, just read & follow the directions.<br>  I am 42 and use both, mostly pads.|`|dpgXzMenaa	An awful lot of people are superstitiously afraid of young girls putting things in their vaginas, or of women putting anythinig but a husband's penis in there (because these people have serious sexual issues, usually).

AA11325220	Here is something general I think that everyone should consider.<br>  <br>  You need to stress test your body, but without going to far.<br>  <br>  ie Take a short walk outside and see how you feel then.<br>  <br>  Going to far would be going back to school, or running, or doing something too stressful to start with.<br>  <br>  I have a belief that feeling fine at home is no proper indicator, and one needs to check how you feel out and about, but not yet be far from going home, if you start to feel unwell again.|`|uvOhOUllaa	haha you caught it from my mom.

1h7lAJ8Daa	Firstly, may I say having PTSD is not embarassing. To say it is is to insult all the other people (like myself) who have been diagnosed with it.<br>  <br>  I have PTSD because when I was 12 a gang of robbers broke into my home and stabbed my dad having previously killed an elderly lady in her home 15 minutes before. Is that not a good enough reason?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that your life has been full of victimisation. I really am! But you need to take action for yourself. Visit your GP who can reccommend a suitable pyschiatrist or perhaps prescribe medication.<br>  Also, speak to your family and friends who ultimately are the people who can get you through all this.<br>  <br>  I Promise you that there is a light shining brightly at the end of every tunnel that we go through in life- its taken me a while to get to the end- but I got there- and so will you!!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Best Wishes xxxx|`|TXkMMQV3aa	I have PTSD too,but to me it isn't an embarrassing condition it is one which i have as a result of a very traumatic childhood and like you i experinece the symptoms you are describing.Sometimes it is hard for me to be around lots of people,maybe cause it is due to the anxiety,sometimes bringing my cd player with me helps a lot especially if the store is busy,it helps with keeping me grounded,yes,i also do a fair share of dissociating and have to be careful to stay grounded in certain places,as that leads to me switching and that isn't good,as i could expose someone inside to something that can be very triggering to them,that can surely cause chaos for us all.|`|doha66YWaa	*hugs*<br>  Have a go at therapy, get them to talk to you about confidence etc and do your best to just go out and talk to people.<br>  Practice makes perfect after all :)|`|049a5ee66231db2295d9daeba62a36bcaa	In order to leave this lifestyle behind, you may need to get stabilized on medication and then focus on a career or any job you can do consistently.  You need to try and think cat instead of dog, in other words get a job or something to focus on and get your focus off your past, you will never solve it,  just try to move on.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	If it helps at all, your description of both the syndrome and your feelings about having the syndrome exactly matches the two people I know in real life who are going through PTSD.<br>  <br>  I think besides therapy, meds, etc the best thing you can do is build little successes for yourself.  Take on a small challenge, succeed and then let yourself be proud of your success.  Then up the ante a bit, rise to that challenge, then take even more pride.  Build some pride in yourself, nurture it and then you can focus on that when the darkness threatens.

Rk46lIBwaa	This is a common but often missed phenomena called petechial haemorrages. There are a number of causes, one of them exactly as it has been explained to you, is forceful vomiting. The pressure in the small blood vessels of the face rises, some of them burst releasing tiny amounts of blood. These are particularly noticeable though the fine skin of the face but can also occur on the neck and below the conjunctival surface of the eye where they are also easily seen.|`|NS1JHMmgaa	Could be. Depends on violent the vomiting is.<br>  Also, if she's vomiting up bile, as it is highly acidic it could be eroding the blood vessels in her mouth from the inside out. <br>  That's just my opinion though. I'm not a doctor.|`|fBXD8T6Uaa	don't worry as you've probably seen it goes after a while. I get this when i am being sick. i'm 14.

EKRyIAF2aa	If you're really determined start startving yourself completely, start the day off with a cup of tea and then wait till dinner.<br>  By then you won't even have an appetite and probably won't eat all of your meal anyway. <br>  <br>  That's what I did and it worked a charm.<br>  I decided to skip lunch since I have a whole meal (at school) <br>  I then realised that I wasn't eating anything until dinner because I don't eat breakfast.<br>  <br>  I kept this up for about a month or 3 weeks... somedays not eating anything at all and I lost a ton of weight!<br>  It all dropped off my stomach, thighs.

688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	My son has food allergies.  And we've done all the various types of testing.  My first word of advice, if you have a long list of things show up on the test, is to also do another form of the test.<br>  <br>  This was our experience...<br>  <br>  First we did the blood testing.  It said my son was allergic to eggs, milk, soy, wheat, beef and oranges.  That list covers almost everything out there!  Since that would be very difficult to avoid, if it's not really necessary, our doc also did the skin test.<br>  <br>  The skin test narrowed it down to eggs, milk, soy and wheat.  OK, that's better, but still crazy.  We were certain about the milk and egg because he's had reactions to them.  But I didn't believe the soy and wheat because he had both with no problem.<br>  <br>  So that took us to the "food challenge".  That's where you sit at the docs office for an hour and eat the food in question.  If there is no reaction in an hour, then you are considered safe.<br>  <br>  The food challenge eliminated soy and wheat... and narrowed it down to just milk and egg.<br>  <br>  We will test again in the summer to see if anything changes.<br>  <br>  So while they do have the blood test, it is also possible to get false positives.  If you have a long list of allergies... or potential allergies, I'd suggest doing more than one test so that you really know for sure.|`|AA12352550	I get blood allergy tests done all the time. My allergist told me they are more acurate. All they do is test your blood and it comes back in numbers to how allergic you are to whatever they tested you with.|`|LsAArkUyaa	The blood test is more accurate but many Drs don't use them because the Dr makes more money on the skin tests.<br>  <br>  One thing you might consider is rereading all the labels of foods you are eating. Often manufactures will change the recipe or change something else in the manufacturing process. IE I believe it is goldfish crackers that contain an allergen if from some plants but not others because of other foods being made in the same plant. I can't remember is the allergen is soy or nuts, but I do remember a long conversation on a BB about it a long time ago.|`|lVHBqDJEaa	I think skin tests are the most accurate, and I know allergies can change - I've heard every seven years, but I'm not sure about the time frame. It's definitely worth being tested again - and also keeping a journal of what you're eating and being exposed to on days you have allergic reactions. Good luck!
1iXvphNYaa	I can't be too sure and I don't want to lie. However, you seem very much on a good track and I'm sure if you continue this way with a reasonable amount of exercise included you won't be far from your goal. Peace. :)
UdIybwRpaa	Like the previous answer said, taking an ibuprofen after one beer this one time is not going to cause a problem with your liver. On the other hand, if you are feeling sick/nauseous if anything it will likely just make you feel even worse. Ibuprofen is for pain relief and will irritate your stomach, not make it feel better.|`|XhrAjcilaa	No, there's no problem. The problem comes if you're drink multiple drinks daily, and also regularly take pain relievers. It takes quite a bit of time for that combination to mess with your liver.<br>  <br>  With that said, it sounds like an ibuprofen might not help what's going on with you. If you got that ill that quickly, it might have to do with something you ate (food poisoning), or it being a really old beer, or something of the sort.<br>  <br>  Like I said, the Ibuprofen is not a problem at all, but I'd also drink a bunch more water to flush your system out.

87756LlTaa	You should increase the amount of natural fiber in your diet.  Eat high fiber (though usually icky tasting) cereal once or twice per day.  If this repulses you, try metamucil or another over the counter fiber souce.  It is very, very important that you drink lots of water with fiber.  If you don't, it will cause worse constipation, because the fiber will be more like cement than a moist, bulking agent.  I agree, don't take laxatives until you absolutely need to.  You may also try colace, a stool softener (generic = docusate).  It's OTC, cheap, and a softener, not a laxative.  Ask your doctor next time you see her.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|4Quo7TB2aa	Water; I bet your body doesn't get enough water, drinking like 3 - 4 10 ounce glasses of water a day will help your constipation, your energy level and your health in general. It's a safe alternative to laxatives. Medications that cause constipation even state to up your consumption of water to help with constipation. Also, iron is constipating itself so you should cut back on other things that are constipating like sweets, and caffeine.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Hi, I had the same issues after being put on iron supplements for anemia myself. Instead of laxative which contain chemicals and can cause you body to rely on them (along with the cramps and bloating) you can try using a powdered fiber supplement like Benefiber. The nice thing is you can add it to anything and you won't taste a difference, from plain water to pasta sauce. Stay away from too many bananas, rice, applesauce and toast as these are usually prescribed to people with diarrea to bind them up a bit. If you are still experiencing the negative effect a sure fire way to get things moving is to combine orange juice and prune juice 1-1 and then warm. Drink it down and you should have a bowel movement within twelve hours if not much sooner. It's an old hospital trick (they call it a "stick-o-dynamite).|`|CHiEKZrLaa	Iron is notorious for causing constipation...<br>  <br>  In the diet, "animal sources" are by far the best bang for the iron buck, particularly red meat (if you don't eat beef, consider lamb?)  But if you're a vegetarian or don't eat much meat, dietary intake of iron can be enhanced quite effectively by incorporating blackstrap molasses.  (It's yummy, too!  Think cookies, dip your rice cakes in it, drizzle some on a salad with a vinegrette, etc.)<br>  <br>  Also... believe it or not, cooking in a cast-iron pan can dramatically increase your dietary iron intake!  Particularly if you're cooking acidic foods... so try making any tomato-based sauce in a cast-iron pan once or twice a week.  Stewed/canned tomatoes are quite acidic.  Plus the high levels of lycopene is good for everyone in the family!  :)<br>  <br>  For straight-up supplementation, you may need to switch to a different iron supplement/different brand.  IRON CHELATES (iron bound to amino acids) tend to be more absorbable and much more gentle on the digestive tract (less constipation.)  Ask at your local healthfood store for ferrous gluconate or ferrous fumarate.<br>  <br>  Some supplement examples:<br>  Land Art - liquid iron<br>  PhytoPharmica - RBC (Iron)<br>  Solgar - Gentle Iron<br>  <br>  **Note:  When supplementing with iron, it's important to periodically have your blood levels checked.  Excess iron is a risk for cardiovascular incidents (heart attack/stroke.)**
kdvizdoFaa	That's how i was the first two years. But mine were light and not regular. Then all of the sudden they got heavy and painful =[  also ended up being 3 weeks apart. <br>  <br>  Take some type of pain medication. I took advil. that helps for a few hours.|`|wFKuX8Glaa	Your period can change over time as you get older, and based on your level of activity. As for those cramps, try a warm bath, or a heating pad and take some Advil or Midol. Going on a birth control pill can also help the flow and cramps as well.|`|BXHfVkaJaa	Yes we all get those heavy days but its totally normal. You can always try over the counter medication like Ibuprofen or Advil. A back massage helps as well. Putting your legs up on the couch will relieve some pressure on you abdomen. Drinking lots of water, heavier cramps means that your body is dehydrated so drink lots of water! A hot pad on your stomach works out too
Tl5CPgFcaa	Do you have a community pool in your area? Or a YMCA/YWCA with a pool? Memberships to those places don't cost too much, and since you're under 18, I'm sure you can get a cheaper rate.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	Swimming would be great.  Do you live near a Y?  You could probably get a great deal there - especially if you told them your circumstances and what it is you are looking for.|`|xZsGpN9iaa	do a Google search for juvenile arthritis or call local chapter arthritis foundation or if ur in USA dial 211 Infoline and ask for resources near you take care cp in CT|`|4Vz8lBlwaa	swimming (can you go to your local YMCA?)<br>  or yoga are both good ways to get exercise.|`|5eQeHJJiaa	You don't need to pay for a trainer to tell you what to do. Most of these "Trainers" at your local gym don't know any more then what they are told by their boss. Water sports would be your best bet of course and as long as you know how to swim all you need do is find a place you can do it. The "Y" is a good start and I belong to a jewish community center even though I am not jewish. If you cant get to a pool that's okay, working out at home is an easy way to do it, calisthenics,(stretching, yoga, and light work outs) are often the best. What you should focus on is your diet, and sleep patterns. The best thing you can do for yourself is develop good eating habits, do some sit ups and crunches at home and if u feel up to it use light weights. A wii fit is a great machine for not so serious work out enthusiasts and if you cant afford that just look up a good light workout online. Good luck.
APuRA6hzaa	Appendix?-For reasons not fully understood the appendix can become infected + filled w/puss. The symptoms include pain and cramps in the area between the hip bone and the navel, fever,nausea+vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea. You might not get all the symptoms, I know<br>  of people who just had the pain. What concerns me is that it hurts when you press on it. I would go to the doctors or the ER. That is nothing to mess around with.|`|079XqE8Jaa	It is possible that it is your appendix. Check your fever, and if you have felt nauseous or vomited at all go to the doctor immediately.

AtnU1N7faa	a combination of both! Diet and exercise, your not going to loose weight if you go for a 30 minute jog and then stop and eat a candy bar, soda and a bag of chips!|`|8Y9timR4aa	both|`|kew2l7Acaa	Do both.|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hi,  to get your results in the fastest possible time healthily, you need to combine aerobic exercise (jogging) with resistance training, focusing on the large muscle groups and a healthy eating plan.<br>  leave one out and it would be like getting to the end of a jigsaw and find a piece missing!  The picture wouldn't look great.<br>  The reason why resistance training is needed, is because it helps to increase your metabolism and stabilise your joints, therefore reducing the risk of injury and increasing the rate at which you burn calories!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps to answer your question.<br>  UK Personal Trainer|`|62AmEz1zaa	I am on the same page as you because I try to get on the treadmill at least 5 days a week and do it for 30 minutes.  I also eat healthy too.  I eat 6 meals a day and yes I cheat but it's ok to do every once in a while.  I think eating healthy and exercising are the 2 things that go well together.  The jogging burns the calories and eating good helps you stay maintained and keep the fat level down.  You need to keep doing both and you should be fine.  Hope that helps.|`|DdqiznkWaa	I would say jogging, it would speed up your metabolism and burn fat :)|`|dazcCQDFaa	you need to do both!|`|fnLZNjSbaa	i'd say jogging and try to do it regularly<br>   i hate starving myself and it can't be healthy that way, so keep eating healthy and exercise at the same time :)
xnZi0i8saa	It sounds like you are really stressed and overwhelmed. The pill can make this harder by messing with your hormones. The best thing to do is try not to stress. Easier said than done, I know. Work on what needs to be taken care of know and try not to think about the other stuff until you have to. If that just is not working then see your doctor, he may be able to give you something to help get through the worst of it.|`|2ORqOh51aa	you have a lot going on in your life right now, take a bit of time for yourself to do nothing but read a book or watch a movie you enjoy.<br>  <br>  Make an appointment with your doctor, he/she can adjust your medications. <br>  <br>  In the mean time hang in there. It's bound to get better.|`|wn5HWdzGaa	It could very well be the pill. Hormones can really cause havoc sometimes. Maybe your Dr. can give you a bc pill with low dose hormones. Even though you have other things going on right now, i think<br>  that may be the answer. Good Luck.
6utUL9Hiaa	Talk to your doctor about them giving you a 6month or 1 year prescription- they probably only gave a month at a time to make sure you liked it and was working well with your body.|`|eRrzvV7Aaa	Im pretty sure that you can walk into any drugstore and buy them.|`|4Vz8lBlwaa	to renew a prescription, yes you need to see the doctor. ask him/her to give you a year's prescription, or at least 6 months. it's annoying when they only give you a month...i hate when they do that lol.

dIgthLnLaa	it sounds like hypoglycemia.<br>  your body is in fact overproducing insulin.  <br>  when you have a high carb/sugar intake your body will produce a large dose of insulin.  in the case of people suffering from hypoglycemia, the body misjudges the insulin needed and therefore there is not enough carbohydrate for the insulin to work on and it ends up bringing down the bodys natural blood sugar level.<br>  <br>  i always compare it to if i (a type 1) accidently take to much insulin and not eat enough carbs.  the insulin just keeps on working anyways and i'd go low :(<br>  <br>  as far as i am aware hypoglycemics are advised to small regular meals and avoid high carb/sugar foods.<br>  <br>  i hope this makes sense.  i would definately look into it if i were you.  <br>  i know its not a proper answer but hopefully it points you in the right direction!|`|5QtseYWuaa	Oh my mom has this.

IqlvboR5aa	Before is always good, as long as you eat something SMALL and high in protein about 30min before hand to help with your energy. Most people think working out on an empty stomach is a good idea...this will just leave you feeling light-headed and not really wanting to actually workout!! If you decide to eat after, make sure you have a good amount of healthy carbs!!<br>  <br>  If you do decide to workout after eating, I would wait about an hour, maybe more if you had a larger meal. Just to help avoid feeling bloated or crampy. <br>  <br>  I workout after eating dinner, wait 45min, workout and then finish it all up with a protein shake. That helps me mentally knowing that I also burned off the calories that I ate with dinner!!|`|46xuKWyEaa	before is usually the better bet.  If you try to do it after it's harder because your body starts to digest and then you get naturally sluggish and lazy.  Plus you run into the risk of something not sitting right in your stomach and you end up not going at all...so before is usually a safe bet, maybe have a small snack like a fruit bowl or something before you go so you're not starving and have something to produce energy.|`|1tjJPHpMaa	Before. You won't get cramps and you will burn more fat. If you do it after, you will just burn what you ate, no fat.|`|fc5c0507db7f5b77389a61a92ae3cf1faa	whatever is better for you.

9pLdhuBnaa	This irregular period and the pelvic pain could be a side effect of the Mirena (an example only).<br>  <br>  However, that warm feeling that you are having and the cramping causing you to double over is not normal.  I would recommend getting a hold of your doctor first thing in the morning to let them know what's going on.
L1M5PXMyaa	I don't know if this will help but I felt like sharing..........I was at GNC yesterday and they had free samples sitting out of the acai berry chews so I tried one and noticed that I had NO appetite for quite a few hours, I had to make myself eat lunch!  The chew also made me tired and lazy but I quite often have strange reactions to herbs, vitamins and supplements so the tired part could just be me.|`|2ncaaoFPaa	They're a gimmick. They're a great demonstration of the placebo effect though.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	I've never tried it but I've seen a lot of questions about whether it's just not working for them or if it really is a ripoff.|`|YX93lq4daa	You can not buy acai berries in US, as they are from Brazil. Also due to the fact that they spoil very fast! I would suggest going to your local store buying a selection of blueberries, blackberries, or other dark colored berries.  All are a very good source of antioxidants!  If you still want to try acai, go to the store and buy acai juice. Any store sells it(it is a bit expensive). I usually get it for about 2.50 on sale regular it is about $4-5(about 13-16 oz.). I often add the freeze dried powder(from mountain rose herbs) to blended ice drinks. I like the taste.<br>  As far as weight loss goes..In my own experience NO!

a1KqdXLXaa	If you are a smoker it will take longer for the bleeding to stop, also if there was any infection around the tooth it will take longer to stop.  You shouldn't be concerned unless it is gushing.  Gentle seeping for up to a few hours is considered somewhat normal.  Do not rinse!  Right now a blood clot is forming in the socket, which stops the bleeding and allows the tissue to heal.  If you rinse or smoke or suck liquids through a straw you may dislodge the clot and get dry socket which is extremely painful.  Continue to place gauze over the socket and bite down on it to put pressure on the would, it will help stop the bleeding.|`|cPTRlMJ8aa	approximately the bleeding will stop completely in about an hour. <br>  <br>  the reason why you don't rinse is because when you do, the movement of the water & your cheek muscle in your mouth can make the blood cloth comes off. blood cloth is very essential to your recovery cause it closes your wound and will become the basic of your new soft tissue. by tomorrow the blood cloth will be hard enough, so it won't come off. but you still need to be careful, cause it takes approximately 1-2 weeks for your wound to completely heal. by that time i believe your dentist will ask you to come back to have a check up or removing your stitches.|`|tQFY2AKnaa	my partner had exactly the same problem<br>  it bled all the day that he had his wisdom tooth out but the next morning he rinsed with cordosyl mouthwash and it stopped bleeding in about 2 minutes<br>  i would use the cordsyl mouthwash to rinse tomorrow, as that helps it stop bleeding too <br>  <br>  don't worry its all normal :)|`|U00ZQfxYaa	I had a tooth extracted today too! I feel your pain! Having had this procedure done before 12 moths ago, I should be able to give you an idea of what you need to do!<br>  <br>  When a tooth is extracted, a blood clot forms in the socket, the hole that's left behind. This blood clot allows the socket to start healing.<br>  <br>  If you rinse out your mouth, it can dislodge the blood clot, which will cause a condition called dry socket, which can be very uncomfortable, and means that the extraction site takes longer to heal. Don't rinse for 24 hours to give the blood clot the best possible chance to start the healing process. <br>  <br>  Anything that causes pressure in the mouth can make the blood clot dislodge itself. This includes smoking and drinking with a straw. Even coughing or sneezing can cause enough pressure for the blood clot to dislodge itself. <br>  <br>  If your mouth is still bleeding, get your dressing, dampen it with a little water and bite down on it for for at least 15 minutes. (I had the packing on mine for nearly an hour before I took it out, and it's not bled since.) If this doesn't help, you might want to try using a cold, moist teabag, as the tannin in the tea helps with the healing. <br>  <br>  The bleeding should stop by tomorrow, unless of course you knock or prod the blood clot with your tongue!! (It's so tempting to poke the hole with your tongue, but you must resist it!!) After 24 hours, you can start gently rinsing your mouth with salt water, preferably lukewarm so that it doesn't cause any unnecessary pain from temperature sensitivity. And when I say gently, just allow the the solution to sit in your mouth for a minute or so, no swishing it around your mouth!<br>  <br>  Avoid corsodyl or other mouthwashes as the socket can still be very sensitive. Also, corsodyl is know to stain teeth if used for long periods, so excercise care!<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	I had a wisdom tooth (as well as the one in front of it) removed yesterday. They told me to keep it packed for 3 to 4 hours. They also told me to not look at the packing itself to see how much I'm bleeding, but to look at the incision itself for 30-60 seconds instead. It was also recommended that I put a warm wet Lipton teabag on it instead of the packing to slow the bleeding and to alleviate pain (it's the tannic acid that helps). I was also told not to rinse, spit, or anything that involves sucking. This can lead to dry socket, which I hear is very painful and can lead to serious infection.<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better.|`|aEpPt9koaa	It depends on which tooth is extracted.  I had a couple of molars extracted and the bleeding had stopped by the time I got home from the dentist.  But if you had a wisdom tooth removed then the bleeding will last longer.  Im not sure about the rinsing part, why didnt you ask her?
AA11657796	what you can do is this:<br>  <br>  * stop eating sugar, it's best to get rid of the addiction to (the taste of) sugar then to take artificially created sweeteners. Besides I've read an article that sais that artificial sweetners may help to lose weight at first, but in the lon run add in weight gain. So don't use them to long.<br>  <br>  * eat whole grain products, to make sure you'll feel satisfied after a meal and to make sure it'll be a while before you'll start feeling hungry again<br>  <br>  * make sure to add enough fruits and vegetables to your diet. Don't eat to many fruits though, fruits still contain (natural) sugars. But since they contain lot's of vitamins and mineral as well, they are essential in any diet.<br>  <br>  * eat low fat products, low fat means low calories (as does low suger products, so when you see something 'light' make sure to check if they mean light in fat or light in suger...some light products contain lots of sugar, but are allowed to use the name light because they're low fat)<br>  <br>  * skip the in-between meal snacks, and if you're really hungry between your meals, eat fruit or a sandwich instead of snacks. Trust me, after a while you’ll find out you can do without the snacks between the meals<br>  <br>  * learn to listen to your body...eat when you're feeling hungry (real hunger, not just an appetite for something), stop eating when you're full. <br>  <br>  * make sure to exercise every day at least 30 minutes...even walking is good, as long as you do something active, and something besides your daily activities.<br>  <br>  * don't take the diet to seriously...a good diet is a diet that allows you to enjoy your meals. If you feel like eating a fat burger, eat it. Just make sure to not do that every day.<br>  <br>  <br>  don't forget that a healthy diet results in only 0.5-1kg weight loss a week|`|vPeNKLK7aa	I found the advice on this site very useful.

VPlKbDplaa	Hi Bronwyn<br>  I am not a doctor either but I agree with Nemostar on this one. Biology and Chemistry are foundation subjects for medicine and so is Physics (for the high tech machines used nowadays) to a certain extent. Study hard and get the good grades as that helps in getting onto the course and a good grade in Maths, Physics and English will help also as well as Chemistry and Biology. <br>  <br>  They want to see proof (in the grades) that you are academic enough to stand up to the rigors of the course. But also they want to see evidence that you have good people skills as you will be with patients most of the time and need to be able to relate to them and be tactful with them. If you can get some work experience in a community setting it would help I think. <br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.|`|gBxp933Daa	No you do not require health and social care, I wouldn't worry about it|`|wNgNDk96aa	hi, i am not quite a doctor but i did apply for medicine this year and i can promise you the only things required to study medicine at university is biology and chemistry. Anything else related is a bonus though and can always be written in your personal statement which may draw attention to you. all im trying to say is that if health and social is something your not too keen on don't do it because the last thing you want is a bad grade pulling you down.<br>  <br>  hope that helped :D
xzR3H2gYaa	I'm sorry to tell you what you don't want to hear but that is the best way to loose weight.  The easy way out is going to be hazardous to you health even surgurey can be dangerous, you can die from complications.<br>  <br>   If you stick to it you will loose weight, if you haven't it is because you haven't stuck to it long enough.  There is a period when you are dieting where you will plateau but if you stick with it and ride through the plateau with you head up and confident you will start to loose again, this is where most people quit because they say this is not working so they quit but that's where they should be trying harder because the plateau will pass, it is completely normal to have a plateau.  I'm mean anything else would be hazordous to your health trust me, it is not worth it.  Why do you think you hear it all the time that diet pills arent safe?? There is a reason for it.  You can loose weight by starving yourself but again you wont feel well at all and you will make yourself very ill in the process. <br>  <br>  PLEASE!!!  I know this is not what you were looking for but PLEASE try one more thing before you decide cut the whole dieting thing.  Try going on a low glycemic diet and order this amazing work out program it is called P90x.  I noticed a difference within the first week.  It's quite pricey but it was well worth the money.  It is pretty much like an at home boot camp but you can tailor it to fit to what ever you are looking to get out it, mussle (like we are talking ripped), lean and toned etc..<br>  <br>  PLEASE TRY THIS BEFORE DECIDING TO DO SOMETHING HAZORDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH!!!  If you stick this even through the rough times where you plateau and you still didnt find a difference then do what you want but PLEASE try this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK =)|`|a7304771ffb5c60d1b31049265f63568aa	Try wuyi tea it is great for weight loss, i have lost 30 pounds so far in one and a half months and i couldn'e be happier! :)

N5oFFkfjaa	I had the same problem and I thought it was because my boyfriend qualified as "cute" on my list, not "sexy"... his appearance didnt particularly turn me on,  (i'm not being shallow, but this happens, when you see a totally random but hot guy and all of a sudden you get these dirty thoughts on your mind lol)<br>  Plus my boyfriend didnt exactly know about those "specific" things that turn me on, like whispering dirty stuff in my ear, which actually truns me on like crazy... and I didnt want to tell him because it would be even sexier if he just discovered it his own, if he just magically KNEW what to do... <br>  He never did crazy things during sex either, he played it safe and his awkwardness infected me... yeah.<br>  <br>  Maybe your boyfriend is the same.. :)|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|g2ulTHNGaa	It just sounds to me like you enjoy getting yourself off rather than your boyfriend getting you off.

Alternate the 20 minutes every day. Your diet will consist of 2 pieces of toast for breakfast(if you eat breakfast) your lunch could be a salad, yogurt with fruits/veggies then for dinner have only one small plate of whatever is being served.

It is the same protien as in eggs and it is slower to digest so it will keep you feeling full longer.<br>  <br>  Even better though, is to replace protein shakes with a high protein snack with some fruit or veggies. Like 3 oz. Tuna with an apple. Your body will always respond the best to "real food".|`|S4soZUFCaa	Protein shakes are a waste of money, so is any other 'protein' product.

AVzQs5Uhaa	its probably an ear infection that could have traveled, this happens when they are not treated after a while, i suspect this because of the fever ,chills, pain in the ears, dizziness and falls as the ear helps with equilibrium and when that is disturbed you have a higher chance of dizziness and falls.

This can be done in the same way that people train to get stronger by pushing that system to its limit for a period of time. <br>  <br>  When trying to get muscles stronger, you lift heavy weights to the point of failure and your body starts to adapt. <br>  <br>  For your lungs, the best kind of training is interval training. Same as lifitng weights, you don't have to lift for 3 hours to get stronger. Same goes for expanding your lung capacity. If you run for 30 minutes, and run at an easy pace for 2 minutes and then run as fast as you can (that's as FAST as you CAN) for 1 minute, then rest for 1 minute and repeat. <br>  <br>  You can also do 400m - 1 mile sprints as fast as you can, rest and repeat. These are good ways of increasing lung capacity.<br>  <br>  Other good excercises would be a 400m sprint plu 50 body weight squats x 6 rounds as fast as you can. Record your score and see if you can beat this score every week.<br>  <br>  Good luck

I usually had my carb drink during warm ups on a stationary bike, then hit the weights and a myoplex or some kind of protein when I finished.<br>  Also what worked for me with abs, was that I did them all workout. Like between exercises, even between sets at times to keep my heart rate up, because I hated to try to do them all at once at the end of a workout.

REQWidzFaa	Hey, I'm a medical student and we were studying contraception recently, so this is the info we were given on depoprovera:<br>  It's an intramuscular injection of the hormone progesterone, and it's over 99% effective.<br>  It works like other hormonal contraception, primarily by preventing ovulation to stop you getting pregnant.<br>  It's effective for around 3 months, then you can take it again.<br>  It's very effective and it can stop your periods as well.<br>  <br>  Some of the disadvantages:<br>  If you develop side effects you can't undo the injection so it could be 3 months before they clear up. <br>  Also, because people metabolise it at different rates, there can be a small delay in return to fertility after you stop taking it.<br>  Some people also report mood changes, low sex drive, bloatedness and headaches.|`|o1Qmp8Hhaa	it contains no estrogen and has synthetic progestin in it|`|QeUQhMQkaa	I was on it & I def. recommend to NEVER go on it.<br>  I'm still dealing with crampings after over a year with being off of it.<br>  It made me gain weight & I hated how I felt on it.

Or, there are medications that can make it go away faster.  <br>  <br>  For people with a heart attack, there are several cures.  One is percutaneous intervention, with a stent being placed in the blocked artery.

dpgXzMenaa	One simple and cheap way to help with cramps (it's also the quickest, and the most convenient and natural) is having an orgasm by masturbating.   It doesn't work for *all* women, but it does help many... and for some, it can get rid of cramps entirely for a while.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.h...</a><br>  <br>  "... an orgasm can cause your uterus to contract, enabling it to use up excess prostaglandins in the process. Prostagladins are hormones produced by your uterine lining. They help to stimulate contractions that move menstrual blood out of the uterus, and are also responsible for those cramps that occur throughout your period."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kadir-buxton.com/page8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kadir-buxton.com/page8.htm</a><br>  <br>  "Primary Menstrual Cramps can be a debilitating problem for some 10% of women. Conventional treatment can even be as drastic as exploratory surgery whilst looking for a cure. A less intrusive solution is available. Orgasm from masturbation has been found to relieve the painful symptoms of menstrual cramps. Whilst it is not always convenient to masturbate for the necessary five minutes until the pain subsides, hands free masturbation is still possible. In order to do this one simply has to clench and then relax the vagina repeatedly for five minutes. With this method no one need know of the discomfort being suffered, and the pain soon goes.

Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|tGcNmDUZaa	I don't know about the stronger abs, but sex does help. If you are in the army I understand this would be difficult - just keep it in mind if ever you can.<br>  <br>  What can really help with cramps is menstrual cups. Many people say they dramatically decrease the cramping pains, although there is no scientific reason discovered yet. <br>  <br>  They are soft silicone bell-shaped cups that sit low down in the vagina and collect all menstrual fluid. They can be worn for up to 12 hours (and I personally have worn mine for longer, without anything bad happening) so could suit you better than endless tampons and pads. However you do need a supply of fresh water to clean the cup in - would you have this? If so the menstrual cup is for you.<br>  <br>   I won't reccommend any particular brand over another - everyone has their favourites - but I will give you some links to websites. If you buy one now, you should have it down in 2-3 cycles. So give them a try! They last a whole lifetime and for $20 what have you got to lose?|`|RAP6Nn6Naa	Mirena.

It is usually something that reduces your health or lifespan over time.  <br>  <br>  You are correct that it is often difficult to pin-point the precise "causation" of health related problems -- even death.  Think about all the things you consume and do in your life.  Maybe a host of other things was the "real" cause of death.  Even cigarettes (a substance that is proven to cause health problems) is difficult to "definitively" link to the health outcome.  Indeed, a person who smokes might also be exposed to construction dust, pollution, etc.  So, what actually and unquestionably "caused" the ultimate health problem -- we do not know.  We can only say what "contributes" to it.<br>  <br>  But, I do know the soft drinks can contribute to health problems and, for some people, maybe even be the actual cause of death.  Just look at the red bull guy in the UK article.  Their hypothesis was that the soda (albeit a highly caffeinated one) was the possible cause of death.   <br>  <br>  You are asking for when soda becomes akin to a "poison" for someone to the extent it can cause death.  It is just not comparable. Example:  Does laying out in intense sun one day lead to death? -- No.  Does laying out in intense sun day after day (without sunscreen) lead to possible skin cancer and, thereafter, possible death? -- Yes.  The point is that the sun rays are not bad in themselves.  But, at some point, they can become bad.  The same holds true for soda -- which is just bottled sugar and chemicals (such as caramel color, phosphoric acid, etc.).  200 calories of soda can give you energy and quench thirst.  It may be okay if you otherwise watch your calories and exercise.  But, down 1000 calories of soda per day and sit on your ***,  you end up with a different result.<br>  <br>  Your question is whether soda is toxic --- the answer is probably no (unless you have an enlarged heart or something).  Is soda dangerous if consumed long-term -- Yes.<br>  <br>  If soda was poisonous or generated an acute reaction, it would be banned by the FDA and litigation would ensue by the families of the deceased.  However, I think we may begin to see soft drinks referenced as a cause/factor of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, etc. which lead to death.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/116/5/480" rel="nofollow">http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/...</a><br>  <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/292/8/927" rel="nofollow">http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abs...</a><br>  <br>  Bottom line:  If you like soft drinks and want to find a justification for having them, try to drink them in moderation to avoid the health issues.  If you want to test whether it will kill you, try using soda as your source of calories and fluid for about one week and see how you feel.  Just kidding.  But, think about it, the human body needs vitamins, protein, and other nutrients that cannot be obtained from soda.  At some point, if you drank soda as your only source of energy, it is possible you could die (i.e. recall scurvy epidemic for sailors that did not have vitamin c back in the 1700s).|`|jE0Y9su5aa	It is difficult to prove direct deaths coming from soda. The reason for this is that it's not like drugs where you can have an overdose that will result directly in death.<br>  <br>  However drinking soda regularly will cause diabetes, obesity and can also lead to cancer. <br>  <br>  It seems that you are a little skeptical, check out the link below.|`|BXHfVkaJaa	Yes it is really bad if you drink too much soda. Actually, I was in very bad condition in the hospital. I am a healthy 19 y/o who loves to work out. I used to be a very heavy soda drinker, drank soda before and after every work out. I considered water my worst enemy. My parents have always warn me about not drinking so much. I never listen and just did the opposite of what they wanted me to do. One day I woke up with a horrible stomach ache. I never felt this terrible, it even hurt to breath. Immediately I was taken to the hospital and announce that they found 5 strong infections in my kidney. It was so much for my kidney that they found a crack in my kidney. My recovery was a nightmare, high fevers that cause me to hallucinate, couldn't walk. Soon after I got better, I lost my privilage to drink soda. Doctors told me that I can't drink soda again. Now, its hard to see old people, young people drinking. I wish that I could of taken my parents advice.

BUI2nlUVaa	As mentioned before you don't 'catch' Lupus.  You are born with it.  Most researchers believe that Lupus is a combination of genetics and environmental factors or triggers that actually initiate the Lupus genes.  I have met many men with Lupus and most of them were diagnosed later, on average around 30-35 because most doctors look for anything other than Lupus in these men because it's still considered by doctors to be a 'woman's' disease, just like breast cancer is considered a 'woman's disease'.  However about 10% of all people with Lupus are men and therefore using the amount of people thought to have Lupus in the United States alone that means that 100,000 - 150,000 men have Lupus.  <br>  <br>  So to answer your question, yes it is possible for a 13 year old boy to have Lupus.  If he was properly diagnosed then he went to an outstanding doctor who actually looked at the symptoms instead of making broad generalizations...a rare breed of doctor indeed.|`|G3hTM9qeaa	You don't necessarily "catch" Lupus. It is more likely passed down from your parents or bloodline. 90% of the people that have it are women. The answer to your question is yes but your chances are very slim.
XRdOfOn6aa	The usual treatment is currently surgery.<br>  You indicated that you have "syndrome" and not 'disease"  so it is hard to say what surgery as the syndrome term is used to indicate any source (be it pituitary, adrenal, or ectopic) while disease only refers to pituitary. Pituitary is the most common however. <br>  <br>  I find it very odd that you can go into an office for treatment. There are a few medications out there now, some are in study, to temporarily lower cortisol before one has surgery. They have to be calibrated very very carefully as they can lower cortisol too much. Cortisol is vital for life so while too much is bad, too little is also bad and if one has an adrenal crisis, one risks death. Therefore you need to know the symptoms of adrenal crisis if you are on these meds and post op surgery.<br>  <br>  Symptoms can vary. Some people have very few symptoms and high tests, and others have a lot of symptoms and moderate tests. I was the latter. The most prevalent symptoms are obesity in the belly, a buffalo hump, red/purple stretch marks, high glucose, high cholesterol, high triglicerides, sudden weight gain, fatigue, moon face and thin skin. There are also lots of other symptoms that other people have like poor healing, lowered immune system, acne, hair changes, etc. You do not need to have all of the symptoms.<br>  <br>  If you have surgery, you need to find the best surgeon possible as Cushing's tumors tend to be soft and hard to remove. Not all surgeons are experienced in removing pituitary or adrenal tumors. It has to be researched carefully so that no tissue is left behind (or that a surgeon does not take too much in the case of the pituitary where an inexperienced surgeon can do a lot of damage). This may mean that you may have to travel. I went 3000 miles for my surgery.|`|AA10097817	<a href="http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/cushings/cushings.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/...</a>

Remember Decaying teeth can lead to digestive and intestinal problems. Using a tooth whitening kit in the comfort of your own home will put you in control of your oral care and will give you the freedom to whiten your teeth at a time that is convenient to you.?<br>     The appearance of a person's teeth plays an important role in creating a good first impression. It seems that Americans have taken this advice to heart because in the US alone more than $600 million is spent annually on teeth whitening. As people have become more conscious of their appearance and their smiles there has been an explosion in the number teeth whitening products and there is now a profusion of products available for whitening teeth at home.<br>   <br>   Using a Home Tooth Whitening Kit<br>   <br>    Some of the home use teeth bleaching products include tooth whitening paste, tooth whitening trays and whitening gels. Tooth whitening is one of the fastest and best ways to improve your appearance and the cost of these home tooth whitening kits is around $20 which is affordable for the majority of people. Because of the variety of whitening products available to improve the color of teeth many consumers start by trying the simplest remedy first. A whitening toothpaste is often the first step in the tooth whitening process although it often produces poor or limited results. The next step is usually to move on to a home tooth whitening kit. There are differing opinions about the effectiveness of the home tooth whitening kit. Some people suggest that as a tooth whitening system it is totally inadequate; while others maintain that some of these kits are extremely efficient. Both groups are correct. Often those who suggest that the home tooth whitening kit does not work are the people who use these kits without any prior whitening treatments.<br>   <br>   Home tooth whitening kits are often not powerful enough to whiten the teeth because the concentration of the required chemicals is much lower than that used by a dentist. Therefore, when used for the first time, they will not be as effective as advertised. When purchasing this type of home tooth whitening kit it is always advisable to check the strength of the bleaching agent used. The strength of the bleaching agent - usually hydrogen peroxide - will be listed on the packaging. Look for home tooth whitening kit that contains professional strength bleach. Other tips for using these kits and improving their effectiveness is to use them early - don't wait for your teeth to become heavily stained or discolored. And always follow the directions on the package.<br>   <br>   ?<br>   ?<br>   ?<br>   ?<br>   Advantages of a Home Tooth Whitening Kit<br>   <br>   White teeth are not only a sign of good health but they are also an indicator of good health. Remember that many diseases can begin with poor oral hygiene, and decaying teeth can lead to digestive and intestinal problems. Whitening your teeth in the comfort of your own home will put you in control of your oral care and will give you the freedom to whiten your teeth at a time that is convenient to you and not by appointment. A home tooth whitening kit is much cheaper than a professional whitening treatment by a dentist. Find additional information on home tooth whitening systems.<br>   <br>   Disadvantages of a Home Tooth Whitening System<br>   <br>   Because the chemicals used in teeth bleaching kits can be harsh some people have been known to develop sensitive gums through overexposure to the chemicals. That's why it is important to follow the directions on the package and not to use these products for longer than the recommended time. Some people think that by using the whitening kit for longer or by using more of the product than recommended they will speed up the whitening process. This is unlikely to be the case and can often lead to problems later, including sensitive gums as already mentioned. Whitening teeth at home is a much longer and slower process than professional teeth whitening which can produce instant results.<br>   <br>   ? <br>   ?<br>    Conclusion<br>   <br>   If you begin early to care for you teeth and maintain a healthy oral hygiene program, you may not need to resort to professional whitening. However, do not wait for your teeth to become heavily stained or turn before you think about using a home whitening system. And if you've already had your teeth whitened professionally, ongoing maintenance by whitening teeth at home will assist in keeping your teeth brighter and whiter for longer.<br>   <br>   Alison Stevens is an online author and maintains  The Cosmetic Dentistry Site to assist anyone who seeking information about cosmetic dentistry procedures and tooth whitening.<br>   ?<br>   ?<br>   ?Teeth Whitening Method<br>   <br>   ?<br>     ?<br>   <br>   Teeth Whitening Blog - Information, Comments, Reviews // BlogCatalog

Rarely deficiency can result from a number of hereditary disorders.[2] Deficiency results in impaired bone mineralization, and leads to bone softening diseases[22] including:<br>  <br>  Rickets, a childhood disease characterized by impeded growth, and deformity, of the long bones. The role of diet in the development of rickets was determined by Edward Mellanby between 1918–1920.[23] In 1921 Elmer McCollum identified a substance found in certain fats that could prevent rickets. Prior to the fortification of milk products with vitamin D, rickets was a major public health problem. In the United States the fortification of milk with 10 micrograms (400 IU) of vitamin D per quart in the 1930s led to a dramatic decline in the number of rickets cases.[18] <br>  Osteomalacia, a bone-thinning disorder that occurs exclusively in adults and is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and bone fragility. <br>  Osteoporosis, a condition characterized by reduced bone mineral density and increased bone fragility. <br>  Vitamin D malnutrition may also be linked to an increased susceptibility to several chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, tuberculosis, cancer, periodontal disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, seasonal affective disorder [24][25], peripheral artery disease[26], cognitive impairment which includes memory loss and foggy brain,[27] and several autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (see role in immunomodulation).[18][8] There is an association between low vitamin D levels and Parkinson's disease, but whether Parkinson's causes low vitamin D levels, or whether low vitamin D levels play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has not been established.[28]|`|0L8T85THaa	Hi!

Everyone has seen those posters of a rabbit that has had chemicals poured into its eyes to see the effects. But this is usually to show the price of vanity. What some people tend to forget is that animals are also used for testing vital medicines. We should not be testing on animals for cosmetic or unneccesary substances, but I feel to ban it outright could cause a high degree of human suffering for the fact that this would slow the development of possible treatments for cancer or other other serious ailments in the future.|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	Nope. What is the moral difference between using animals for food, or taking their hide and fur for clothing, and using them to ensure chemical products are safe? We are just one species exploiting another. Testing soaps by dropping solutions into the eyes of rabbits may sound cruel, but is it crueler than a worm burrowing into the eye to lay eggs that will eat it from the inside? That is the sort of thing that happens in nature all the time.|`|Lk7TpfMKaa	Think about it this way. If you were told your mother or other loved family member had a deadly disease, and the only way of finding a cure was to test on a box of 50 rats, would you be happy to sacrifice those rats? I think that question says it all, really. If we didn't have animal testing then thousands or even millions more lives would be lost because we don't know how to cure them. Just some diseases cured by animal testing are: measles, mumps, rubella, tuberculosis, polio. All vaccines are tested on animals as well. If we kill animals for meat to survive, shouldn't we also protect ourselves by killing animals to save us? Obviously it's awful to test cosmetic products on them though, but medicine is essential! Why are we the most dominant species on earth? Because we are the top!
hEH9pWABaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  Think of it this way. Your body is on the verge of growing, so your body requires energy to do so.<br>  <br>  If you lift weights, you'd be putting in alot of energy for muscular hypertrophy rather than physical growth. And that's exactly why weightlifting is "harmful" for you during adolescence.<br>  <br>  Note: Weight-lifting requires a whole lot more energy when compared to, say, Pushups and Abdominal exercises. So you can take my word for it that you can do pushups/Sit-ups, and still grow optimally.<br>  But try to refrain from indulging in any weight-lifting!!|`|xRQAsGRAaa	My school made all guys in 8th-12th grade lift weights.

But out of 500 guys, one guy got hurt during my 5 years there. I don't think it harms you if you do it properly, and be careful.

AA12358000	Mestizadiva707,<br>  It is not clear how you are affected, - OCULAR ROSACEA - ERYTHEMA AND FLUSHING  - TELANGIECTASIS – RHINOPHYMA, -   and apart from the basic guidelines that I include below, it is not possible to advise a course of self treatment. Rosacea results from an inflammatory process about which little is known. The stimulus includes a wide variety of foods as well as environmental, chemical, psychologic, and emotional factors. It is unclear what role, if any, these factors have in the causation or exacerbation of this condition. In particular, the link between emotional stress and rosacea is not well understood. Studies have found possible associations between rosacea and the face mite Demodex folliculorum, Helicobacter pylori infection, and migraine headaches. The progression of rosacea is variable and the typical stages include - facial flushing, erythema and/or oedema and ocular symptoms, papules and pustules, and rhinophyma. A history of exacerbation by sun exposure, stress, cold weather, hot beverages, alcohol consumption, or certain foods helps determine the diagnosis; the first line of treatment is avoidance of these triggering or exacerbating factors. The initial therapeutic step is avoidance of exacerbating factors for rosacea. Physicians normally advise their patients to carefully monitor their exposure to the sun and to regularly use sunscreen products. One study suggests that patients with rosacea may better tolerate sunscreens containing simethicone or cyclomethicone. Irritating skin care products and heavy cosmetics should be avoided. You should be aware that there is no cure for rosacea, but that the variety of treatments available can effectively manage the disorder and minimize the progression of its symptoms. If you wish to take an active role in the treatment of your rosacea you should learn about your trigger factors and taking avoidance measures. Your doctor may well advise antibiotics if there is infection.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition. A licensed physician should be consulted for diagnosis and treatment of any and all medical conditions.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I add a link to the International Rosacea Foundation which has internal links that you may find interesting.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.international" rel="nofollow">http://www.international</a><br>  rosaceafoundation.org/<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  matador 89|`|GOdftVDOaa	Eucerin is a brand that has lots of facial products for rosacea.  They have one moisturizer that is tinted green to neutralize redness, which might help you.  Aveeno also has an "Ultra-calming" line that claims to visibly reduce redness, I use it and I like it, although it doesn't hide flushing.  Clinique also has products to help with redness.  As far as over the counter meds, I can't help you there.<br>  <br>  Hopefully one of those products will help you!!
0uEhqwWlaa	It could be strep throat or a sore throat, but definitely go see a doctor just in case.  One of the symptoms of oral or lung cancer is a lump in your throat that does not go away.  This may be caused by smoking if you have not been doing it long; it irritates the throat.  I doubt giving oral to your boyfriend cause it, though, but you never know.  As for talking to your doctor, first ask about his confidentiality agreement and ask that he not tell your mom these things - but if it is something dangerous, he might have to.  Your health is important enough.

eapxBrm1aa	If it a possibility of enlargement of your glands, however, concidering your stuffy nose and headaches, it is just swollen lymph nodes. They swell up in case of an infection, usually viral. It is nothing to be concerned about, but a regular trip to the doc shouldn't hurt. <br>  <br>  The viral infections could be (based on the season):<br>  <br>  Influenza A (flu)<br>  Strepthroat (unlikely)<br>  Laryngitis/Bronchitis (due to increased swallowing)<br>  <br>  And no, sexual acts do not provide you with swollen lymph nodes, unless your 'partner' contracted an STI and has passed it on. But that is somewhat unlikely, I'm sure you'd hear him scream while he is in the bathroom.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

856f9f629e121d326752210489850fd9aa	Depression - caused by chemical imbalances of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and other important neurotranmitters in the brain which balance emotions is a serious issue. Psychologists state that depression is a unhealthy state which we 'can' work through in order to experience greater levels of happiness. Some who daily experience deep chronic depression may require both prescribed medication along with 'Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy {M.B.C.T.') provided by Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapists and there are some who experience chronic-but not deeply chronic depression who work well with M.B.C.T. alone. Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD along with Psychologists Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal have authored an excellent self-help book called: "The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness". Mindfulness, a simple yet powerful way of paying attention to your most difficult emotions and life experiences, can help you break the cycle of chronic unhappiness once and for all, that you may experience greater levels of happiness. In 'The Mindful Way through Depression', it is explained why our usual attempts to "think" our way out of a bad mood or "just snap out of it" leads us deeper into the downward spiral of depression. Through very insightful lessons-drawn from both Mindfulness and Cognitive Therapy - Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD and Psychologists- Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal demonstrate how to sidestep the negative habits that lead to unhappiness and despair, including self-blame and rumination so you can effectively face life's challenges with much resilience.|`|AA11292692	It could be several things.

(google search gluten free diet, and sugar free diet).  good luck friend!

Accumulating to a total amount of:<br>  <br>  Females = 2000 calories per day<br>  Males = 2500 calories per day<br>  <br>  Eating under that is, ironically, going to force your body to store those 600 calories a day into almost pure fat on your body.  Eating too little slows your bodies metabolism down.<br>  <br>  Eating small amounts regularly, about 4-6 meals a day, will allow your body to function optimally.<br>  <br>  If you continue the way you are going your body will start digesting your internal organs as food and you will become weaker and very ill.

Your metabolism will slow, you will feel tired and sluggish all the time, your immune system will weaken, your period will become irregular (if you're a girl- I assume you are at 99 lbs at 17 years old).  <br>  <br>  In short- you can really screw up your body, and you won't lose FAT.<br>  <br>  Besides- at 99 pounds, why in the world are you trying to lose weight?|`|FJpPCVTCaa	it's probably not that healthy nor an effective diet plan. most people on low calorie diets usually fall off their plan resuming their normal eating habits after wards and regaining, if not more, weight before they were on the diet.<br>  include your height with your weight, calculate your BMI and see if you have a healthy weight.<br>  also the type of calories you take in will affect your health.<br>  simple carbohydrates are more than likely to cause an increase in fat reserves<br>  complex carbohydrates is a slower process<br>  fats/oils hardly contribute to body fat and are usually expulsed from your system before being absorbed<br>  and proteins are even harder for your body to convert into fat because they have to be converted into carbohydrates which then are converted into fats.<br>  thus people lose more weight on high fat/protein diets vs high carb diets.

jE0Y9su5aa	Slim Fast Optima did absolutely nothing to control my hunger. For a person who only needs to lose a few pounds these shakes might be an option but if you are more than 20 or 30 pounds over weight these are not the answer unless you have very strong will power in which case you probably don't need these anyway.

Dr. Rosedale of  " The Rosedale Diet " has spent 7 yrs. of research to develop a new product called MaxWXL, Clinical results in a 8 week test showed an average weight loss of 21.6 lbs. The secret to this pill is that it is safe and reduces your leptin levels. Leptin is a hormone that is responsible to signal the brain that you are full. Here is a small excerpt from one of many free downloads: "Max WLX Offers Hope!<br>  The natural polysaccharides and fatty acids in Max WLX act in two ways to help people lose weight. First, taken a half hour before the two biggest meals of the day (usually lunch and dinner) Max WLX helps to curb the appetite, enabling the dieter to eat less. It’s no secret that cutting back calories and exercising will result in weight loss. The problem is keeping that weight off!<br>  That’s where Max WLX can offer hope because the second thing the formula does (and this has been documented in studies from the University of Connecticut) is to lower leptin levels!"<br>  For more info and free downloads go to: <a href="http://www.maxgxlca.com/130027" rel="nofollow">http://www.maxgxlca.com/130027</a>

Maho3P5kaa	My husband had his tonsils out a few months ago. It took him about 9 days to recover. It got better than worse again before it really went away. The worst days were when the scabs are coming off because it is the most painful. Keep drinking water and keep taking the meds, they are working just not make ALL the pain go away, trust me it is helping take a majority of it away. For the meds, crush them up and mix into apple sauce or yogurt, something easy to get down.

The health officials keep banging on about 5 portions of fruit and veg a day and from that list you've only covered 2 maybe 3 of those portions depending on the amount of salad you had.

WSIZKAQcaa	Please don't listen to all of these negative comments.  Each person heals differently. Root Canals have come a VERY long way. I have been an Endodontic Assistant for 10 years, and most patients feel fine after the procedure. To be "sore" is normal ( even up to a week),  but you should be fine. <br>  I think that in the 10 years I have doing this, maybe a dozen cases came back the next day in pain. Adjusting the medication is usually the solution in that situation.<br>  So, don't worry. You will be fine, I have assisted in thousands of root canals and 98% of them go fine and they are pain free.|`|df805281ce1bc1c7c3de30c04dbcb458aa	I have it done quite a few times.

That can only happen in Ireland, and (unfortunately) I live in Ireland.|`|a1KqdXLXaa	It should feel like you just had a filling done, a bit achey for a day or so but not painful.  If it becomes painful then the dentist did not remove all of the nervous tissue in the tooth and you should let him know right away so he can investigate or send you to an endodontist (a specialist in root canals).

Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|5Eh125uAaa	So something you will enjoy!<br>  Some form of cardio 3 days a week for 45mins - 1 hour each time. This may include any form of exercise that gets your heart rate up. Running, Biking, Swimming, Jump roping, Kickboxing etc.<br>  <br>  Some form of weight/resistance training 3 days a week for 45 minutes each time. This may include weights, resistance bands, kettle bells etc.<br>  <br>  Eat right. Make it a habit to eat right and healthy. Stick to whole wheat pastas and breads. Let go of the sodas or other sugary drinks. Drink half your body weight of water in ounces. Eg: If you weigh 200 punds, drink 100 ounces of water everyday. Each 5 -6 small meals everyday. Include veges and whole grains. Follow your diet 6 days in a week and indulge yourself on one day only. So whatever you get tempted by during the week, have it on one free day. This will help you stay off most of the temptation during the remaining 6 days. And believe me, this works! <br>  <br>  Good luck! Cheers!|`|K45xwCxoaa	Exercise

qqLcvDDKaa	Do alot of aerobic exercises for AT LEAST 10 minutes a day, like running, swimming or bicycle, and stretch alot. This will cause your body to produce the Human Growth Hormone, which will cause your body to increase in bone mass and height.|`|Nv4zY8Bbaa	The answer is that you can actually grow taller after puberty, if you follow particular proven methods. The first has to do with grow taller systems. Most of them are really scams and cannot help you effectively with your problem. <br>  <br>  They will waste both your money and your time. There are though solutions that have proven to be both safe and effective and which promote the buildup of growth tissue and retards breakdown of muscles and bones during or after exercise. <br>  <br>  For best results we suggest good diet, an improved HGH level and a proportional posture to help you get best results. Bones are living tissues that can be helped and nurtured by you provided that you have the right system to boost your height.|`|85BzTcyKaa	peen in poop helps|`|ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

xRQAsGRAaa	No, it actually increases your sperm production in the long run because your body basically keeps making sperm until you're full.

I never took a lot of pain killers and once I was prescribed Flurbiprofen for a very bad case of endometriosis.  You're suppose to take them with food and although I only used them when in extreme pain, it was usually in the middle of the night and I would take one without realizing how strong they were.  I didn't take that many either.  I started to feel extremely tired, nauseated, and had a terrible pain right in the middle of my back.  I thought it was a flu and one night I had what I thought was diarrhoea, the next morning I fainted and fell on our bedroom floor hitting my head on an armoire.  Thank God my husband had come back inside to get something before going to work.  I was totally out, I had pain everywhere and I couldn't even lift my hand.  He took me in his arms, put me in the backseat with blankets(February in Canada, approximately -40°) and brought me to the emergency.  I didn't have much blood left.  They gave me two units of blood and when I was strong enough for the tests, one week later, they found two peptic ulcers that had perforated my stomach.  It took me two years to gain my normal strength back.  Now I have to take Pantoprazole probably for the rest of my life and my diet is quite strict.  If you really need to take NSAIDs, make sure you eat just before and try to endure your pain as much as possible.  Believe me, it's worth it.  It happened three years ago and I have three children.  At the time they were in grade 5, 3 and 1.  Needless to say that I prayed a lot while at the hospital.  Aspirin and dispirine are NSAIDs and paracetamol is acetaminofen.  There's a danger with all medications.  Acetaminophen can cause terrible liver damage if not taken the proper way or if you already have problems with your liver.  You should ask your doctor about his suggestions.  We don't all have the same system.

In addition, you should stay tone and muscular while helping to burn fat. They are separated into 3 days. Keep repeating them over and over again for 30 days. Workouts for two days take one day off, and then work out for 2 days take two days off then 2 days working out and 1 day off, and so on. Then do some cardio in between those and make sure to get plenty of rest and eat plenty of protein and carbs. If you do all of this, then you will need to increase your caloric intake as well.

AA11707529	Your body is 75% water, mostly your  blood, but your organs and muscles use it as well. For example, your kidneys use it to filter any unwanted toxins out of your body, through your urine. Drink up to 8 8oz. glasses of water a day if you can: I'm usually at about 3 Gatorade's single serving sized bottles a day.Nice and cold. Do NOT wait till you're thirsty, either, just drink water  through out the day.<br>  <br>  And kick-boxing is great! It will up your metabolism for one thing, and help burn fat. But you will need to eat whenever you get hungry once your metabolism does increase. Think of your body as a car, and the food you eat as fuel. With a high Performance car, it needs enough high quality fuel to make it run right.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you feel hungry a lot, it's because you are not taking in enough calories. Fruits and veggies are great, but they haven't got enough calories to get you through a day. Try eating regular protein for breakfast [it'll keep you feeling full longer] Have a light lunch, like 2 of protein and some fruit/veggies [or a power bar with 8g or more protein.]<br>  <br>  Dinner should be 2 to 3 oz. of meat, maybe a salad with regular dressing, and a complex carb like a baked potato. Just nothing after 7:pm if you can help it.

Ya, don't starve yourself because when you do, your metabolism slows down and you gain weight. Eat small portions throughout the day. Keep drinking LOTS of water because that will boost your metabolism.|`|AA11447210	Keep track of what you eat so you'll have an idea of your calorie intake. You can overdo it on healthy food just like junk food.<br>  <br>  Bravo you for taking the step though! I wish you the best...eating right and exercising are the keys to fitness. Starving yourself only harms your body, and makes weight gain easier in the future. Do it right...and then maintain that lifestyle to keep the weight off.<br>  <br>  Also, "a lot" is two words, and you "lose" weight (loose is what you want your pants to be).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Wn4UbHVXaa	Umm, i don't think you should eat a lot of fruit, i mean a large banana has i think like 107 or 109 calories in just one + the fat.

Preferrably the nose swabs, they get absorbed into your system faster. <br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water! <br>  And unlike the doctor tells you, I've discovered that the more you heat up your body, the faster your body will sweat out the infection.

pha427Puaa	The human mouth has a predominance of anaerobic bacteria. Flagyl is very effective against anaerobes, hence the normal flora in your mouth was probably greatly reduced. It helps to keep organisms like yeast from overgrowing.  I wouldn't be overly concerned with HIV since the antibiotic use explains your new found condition.|`|AA10563860	It is a likely direct cause form the antibiotics.  Eat yougurt for the next 2 weeks or more easilly take "acidophilus" pill (also called pro-biotics).  This will restore your "good" bacteria balance which gets destroyed on these types of antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Your doctor will likely agree.<br>  <br>  In the future start taking acidophilus when you start a antibiotic regime.  This will also help prevent another yeast infection in the future.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	oral thrush is very common after a round of antibiotics. it usually presents late in the therapy or even sometimes afterwards. reason for it, it kills off all the bacteria in your system even the good bacteria in your mouth. this allows opportunistic infections or fungal infections to grow since they have no competition.<br>  <br>  I highly doubt you have AIDS/HIV - the oral thrush seen in that stetches usually down the whole throat, and has esophagus probs as well - and you would have noticed other symptoms before then<br>  <br>  I would head to the doc and they will probably give you a nystatin swish for your mouth
laVGEEeraa	Dermatologists specialize in your skin.  They remove those extra skin nodes, moles and can tell you what on your skin is what (such as varicose veins).  I saw one recently about something else and he checked me out for moles and other marks too.  Some of what I had didn't look hot but he said its only cosmetic and I could live with it, but if I wanted to remove it he would.  I didn't but I would think you could get your chicken pox marks removed or covered up.<br>  <br>  When you find one (try googling "Dermatologist Southaven" - you should get a bunch of responses) you can always ask them if they can be removed or what before making an appointment.  If you know how many you have and where they may even be able to give you an estimate of the cost.|`|31f7216b4895ebf09f384e8f8fde1657aa	good luck

JZibB53Caa	First, do you really NEED to do this THAT quickly?  <br>    <br>  If yes, then study for a day, select & detail your safe & realistic plan, work that plan religiously, succeed! Then adopt the lifestyle that will put you where you want to be. You will never have to "diet" again!  <br>    <br>  "Rupanjon" gave you a really good link. I looked. There are 11 real people I know who faithfully used "The Cabbage Soup Diet" & achieved success with no harm, although 5 lost more slowly than they wanted.  <br>    <br>  "ny" is right on. He's especially right on about "a couple of dumbbells will help you" because there are always dumbbells around when you want good advice, with "quickie" (& costly) solutions.    [see my "caution" below]<br>    <br>  The advice from "Masika" is excellent "...putting yourself at risk and no event is...".  <br>    <br>  I've never dieted to lose weight, but I've had to improve my diet that had "slipped" into bad habits.  Once to bring cholesterol levels down & into balance; no drugs, just realigning my choice of foods & snacks & adding "healing" food items.  Once to "get healthy again" after chemotherapy where I had actually gained weight during "the cure" - all fat! That period destroyed my musculature, digestion, appetite, & overall health  <br>    <br>  Both times I was successful in only 4  to 7 months, way quicker than my advising doctors expected & without their "diets" or drugs. All I did was religiously adhere to the right foods at the right times, doing all the aerobic exercise & yoga & Aikido I was able (physically & time-wise). Both times I "improved" myself to the health profile of a man 15 years younger. I just "celebrated" the beginning of my 58th year, 33 days past. Now my "profile" is that of a 35 year-old (so far).<br>    <br>  Special "diets" can be used to achieve a needed, planned improvement during a limited period.  Developing lifestyle "habits" of overall healthy living & nutrition will beat any "diet". Search Google for a ton more information. Read the ads last, after you have some facts. <br>    <br>  If you consider any "aids" read up on the FACTS about the man-made chemical concoctions or supplements before you believe ANYTHING in the sellers' ads. If they won't clearly say what they're selling then they're trying to sell you air!  Ads are barely legal lies!  <br>    <br>  CAUTION:  That link about the tea pills goes to an ad-page that stops you from leaving. I had to close the browser to "kill" it!  Green tea is good, real green tea! The Japanese people have the greatest longevity of all people!  <br>    <br>  Good Luck & may you choose wisely for a long life.  <br>    <br>  justJosephhere|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|i9orREV5aa	Why is an event more important than your health??

dpgXzMenaa	You're probably trying to masturbate by inserting something in your vagina... and that's not a very effective way to do it.<br>  <br>  I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Everyone can (and everyone deserves to) enjoy the pleasure of orgasm, including everyone who chooses to enjoy it alone instead of (or in addition to) having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	One word -> LUBE.

PHzWq3anaa	I don't know a ton about the long term effects of smoking marijuana, but I'm sure it would depend on how frequent and for how many years.  Similarly, cigarettes really aren't going to cause any noticeable differences in the short term.  The problem with cigarettes is that they are addictive and legal, so people end up smoking a pack a day for the rest of their life and then big problems eventually arise in many areas of their health.  (Edit: Obviously cigarettes contain more harmful chemicals than THC, but I'm just focusing on the pulmonary effects for this question). I think most people who smoke marijuana do it only occasionally (not 20 blunts a day for 30 years).  If they smoked marijuana with the same regularity, I would guess they would run into the same problems with lung function.  They'd eventually develop emphysema or COPD.  COPD/emphysema isn't just caused by cigarettes, it is caused by the repeated irritation and ultimate destruction of your alveoli in the lungs.  You can think marijuana is natural, but that's irrelevant.  Standing over a campfire and inhaling the smoke would be natural too, but certainly not good for your lungs.|`|RNkQ9qPQaa	Not really, but smoking the joint will kill brain cells but if you are dumb enough to smoke that junk then you are already a couple brain cells short anyway, so go ahead.|`|62505613bde142d2860ef4830e0ef2b4aa	Haha.. notice how the link she gave you is a .gov address.

My source below says, among other things: Not surprisingly, marijuana intoxication can cause distorted perceptions, impaired coordination, difficulty in thinking and problem solving, and problems with learning and memory. Research has shown that marijuana’s adverse impact on learning and memory can last for days or weeks after the acute effects of the drug wear off.2 As a result, someone who smokes marijuana every day may be functioning at a suboptimal intellectual level all of the time.|`|uJDPFp1Raa	My doctor asked me if I smoked pot, and when I said yes all she said was "well, remember that it's illegal." I've never laughed so hard in my life. She practically gave me permission. I know people that have been smoking for 30+ years. I haven't notices anything wrong. Of course inhaling any kind of smoke comes with risks. Decreased lung capability is definitely one of those, but it is MUCH more mild than with cigarettes. That whole it makes you dumb thing is complete BS. There never really has been a proper study done, and I assure you I am adequately intelligent.

The idea is to gradually increase the capacity of the chambers in the penis to hold blood. The bigger the chambers are, the more blood they hold when you get an erection, and so the bigger your erect penis is.<br>  <br>  Pills don't work because all they do is increase the blood flow, not the amount the chambers can hold. At best all they'll do is give you harder erections.<br>  <br>  For quickest results, you should join a program.

gP11453Waa	You worry too much, but that is partly (or mostly) because our societal expectations have been constructed in a dream world.<br>  <br>     Your penis is smaller than average but certainly not tiny.  To put things in perspective, a gorilla's penis is large if it reaches TWO inches.  Yours may grow yet, as you may still be developing--or maybe it won't, and either way will be just fine.  Sexual satisfaction in a person who is not obsessed with size derives from the entire experience--the caressing, the closeness, the time frame, and much more.  And be assured that your penis may just be the perfect fit the girl you love; after all, women's anatomies vary, too.  I can speak from personal experience, as mine is also a bit below average, but making love has been wonderful.  Nobody has ever laughed at my size, except a couple of guys in a school locker room a long time ago.  <br>  <br>      I don't know if your puberty is still going on.  You might want to see a doctor about this.  You may have a trusted physician already, and that would be good, but if not, check for referrals to doctors who have some expertise in this area.  The fact that you are not sure if your testicles have descended could be somewhat concerning.  I suspect they have but that you just don't have a large sac to house them, but you really should get professional advice on this.  If indeed, they have not descended, you need to get that taken care of, as there is greater risk of tumor development and of sterility.  Surely, though, you would know by now.  Fear not, just actually use your hands to see if you can feel them.  Again, get professional advice.  You will feel better.<br>    Here are two links (just two of many available sources) about undescended testicles.<br>  <a href="http://en.allexperts.com/q/Urology-Male-issues-989/Undescended-testicles-Adult-males.htm" rel="nofollow">http://en.allexperts.com/q/Urology-Male-...</a><br>     <a href="http://www.embarrassingproblems.co.uk/testicle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.embarrassingproblems.co.uk/te...</a><br>  <br>         As to the color of your semen--again, you worry too much, but when you get professional advice, your worries will diminish.  Semen is typically the whitish cream you surely think of, but it can be clear, and it can vary in the same person from time to time.  Remember, it consists of various secretions.  Check yours--is it white and then turns clear?  That is very common and nothing to worry about.  Here is a link to all the semen info you could want.<br>  <a href="http://www.menstuff.org/issues/byissue/semen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.menstuff.org/issues/byissue/s...</a> <br>  <br>    Your girlfriend?  If she laughs, she clearly does not understand.  Maybe, if you two are going to have sex or make out heavily, you might want to broach the subject of size before you get too involved.  You could let her know that you are sensitive about it (or that you are NOT) but that you want to please her in a respectful way.  Hey, this could become a lengthy dissertation, but the word respect is very important to success in a relationship--sexual or otherwise.  <br>  <br>          Main advice right now:  get some professional advice.  If you don't have a lot of money or good insurance, there are resources available.  Your local government will have agencies that can help.  Some universities also have great counseling services.  Check around.  Relax.  As to your m8's becoming men while you are not, that is so much hogwash.  They may be bigger on the outside, but you can be big enough there plus bigger on the inside.

spP8uj1laa	It is not about the cramps. It is probably because a cyst burst.  Then there is a fluid in there that starts flowing around freely and you feel pain. It is very common. If you feel a pressure-like feeling on your body, it is torsion. Torsion is when the cysts get heavy on the ovary that causes the ligament (it holds the ovary in place) to twist. This may sometimes be painful, and sometimes it may be pain-free, depending on the case. (usually painful). Do an ultrasound to check for blood flow, because a loss of blood flow will kill the ovary, and it will unfortunately have to be removed. You can mail me if you have any question(s).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|87e0ded175c7b1e6686806afc8bb6b44aa	Go to the hosp as the doctor will not listen to you. Thats not all to do with cramps|`|oEF46EZRaa	I get them all the time.  It sounds to me like one may have burst.  When they burst you get free floating fluid in there and it causes some pain.  The other thing that it could be is torsion...This is when the cysts get so heavy on the ovary that it actually twists the ligament that hold the ovary in place.  It hurts REALLY BAD!! I also had this happen to me and I lost my ovary.  Because loss of blood flow, it basically died in there.  Call your doc and tell him your concerns and have him do an ultrasound to check for blood flow.  If he won't do it go to the ER and have them do it.  Your ovary can be saved if caught in time.

Although I'm not sure how long you can actually live on that kind of a diet.  If you are planning on doing it(and I don't condone this kind of activity at all) don't do it for much longer than a few weeks or you could seriously and permanently damage your brain.  Make sure to use those few calories on sugars for your brain and proteins to reduce the muscle loss.|`|4Vz8lBlwaa	first of all, likely you won't lose much, if any, since you are slowing your metabolism.<br>  second of all, side effects from crash dieting don't always show up right away and they aren't always noticeable. starving yourself could result in heart problems, liver and kidney function problems, hair loss (from malnutrition), etc. <br>  and lastly, your 200-250 calories a day for 3 weeks (and only 3 weeks??) will confuse your body since I'm guessing you will go back to eating normally afterwards. that kind of strain on your body is really bad for your heart and other organs which will try to compensate for malnutrition.<br>  <br>  but good luck! haha|`|7IjGzvqTaa	I'm sorry, but I just can't help myself- this is a STUPID idea.<br>  <br>  <br>  The most you should cut your diet down to is at MOST 1000 calories, and that's still cutting it down far more than necessary.<br>  <br>  The key to losing body fat isn't starving yourself; it's exercise and a well-balanced diet.  Well-balanced does not equal none.|`|dazcCQDFaa	well if you dont have a lot of body fat, you body starts to eat its own muscle and organs to survive if you dont look after it, which eventually will lead to death!  this is not the right way to lose weight. do it the healthy way|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	If you don't die from malnutrition, you'll actually end up gaining weight back faster because your metabolism will slow waaaaaaay down.<br>  <br>  Besides, just because nothing bad happened last time doesn't mean it won't this time.|`|GsSRY7quaa	your body will not function on 200-250 cal a day.  you are starving it. eat more fruit and veggies, less red meat and more fish, chicken (baked, not fried). no sodas. drink water, skim  milk, plain tea and exercise some (walking is ok)|`|ypy1ikVDaa	Well if you loose 3500 calories in some amount of time, you loose 1 pound.

This is you eat 200 calories one day, 400 the next, 600 and then 800 as you are confusing your body and it is burning 200 at the same rate that it is burning 800. <br>  Trust me, this is the best diet ever, ive been on it for like 2 years and i'm skinny as a rake :)<br>  xxxx|`|icEMyJBoaa	I'm no nutrition expert, but I do know a few things:<br>  <br>  -How much weight you lose depends also on how much exercise you get<br>  -Eating only 200 calories a day will drastically slow down your metabolism, which will make it harder to burn fat<br>  -You've probably heard this one before: not very good for your internal organs and brain development<br>  <br>  Your best bet as far as losing weight is to graze during the day: watch your calories, but eat multiple small meals/healthy snacks throughout the day, which will keep your metabolism up. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, and that will help with the weight loss. You don't want to get rid of just any weight, if I am correct in assuming what your goal is--to lose fat weight. Keep your protein intake up, as well as the essential vitamins and amino acids your body needs to function. Just cut out any junk you normally eat.|`|l0bLt48Kaa	i did the exact same thing before and i lost 1-2 pounds a day, with A LOT of exercise...it was really unhealthy though and as soon as you get off of it, you gain the weight all back. just try to do more like 1,000 calories a day that way you lose it and keep it off, instead of just teasing your metabolism|`|5hYIwDGvaa	Well if you already did it before, and lost 30 pounds, I am guessing you will loose around 30 pounds.

Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods.

Cutting out junk food is great, but it's all right to eat some once per week, being healthy all the time is no fun. <br>  Don't ever skip meals or try to starve, but don't overeat either. Eat until you are full, but not stuffed, and make healthy choices of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, dairy, and such. On top of eating well, you want to get in some physical activity. Start a sport or a team, go for a bike ride, dance, run with a buddy, play outside, ect.<br>    I started trying to lose weight at age 14. I was the most successful when I spoke to my parents about it. Me and my dad would go out and walk around the neighborhood together, and eventually as we got fit we started to jog.

47PsTalnaa	Some of the medication they use before surgery can cause you to lose your gag reflex, and if that is lost if you were to vomit it would go back into your lungs and you could get aspiration pneumonia or even die.  <br>  <br>  Alot of people think it's just because they surgery team doesn't want to be puked on, but that's not the case.|`|dksB1B0Laa	What the heck???<br>  Um...when you go through operation, the food will not be disgested<br>  That will be so disgusting!|`|5hYIwDGvaa	The reason you are told not to eat or drink anything for several hours before you undergo surgery is to prevent aspiration. This is a term used to describe the process of food and stomach acids which, under anaesthetic, can be regurgitated during surgery and enter into your lungs. <br>  <br>  <br>  This can happen because under anaesthetic you lose all of your reflexes including the natural capacity to cough and gag when anything is about to enter your airway and, consequently, your lungs. Therefore it’s important that your stomach is empty first.|`|wRi75pycaa	It could make you sick to your stomach because of the medication that could be used in the procedure.

qL96skWRaa	Great home remedy for teeth whitening is as follows:<br>  <br>  mix on small plate the following<br>  1 tsp baking soda<br>  dash of salt<br>  then add a few drops of white vinegar, which will foam.<br>  <br>  Then brush with toothpaste afterwards.|`|f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	One popular tooth whitening product that you can use is bleaching solution that contains peroxide for bleaching tooth enamel. The bleaching agent in these products is usually carbamide peroxide, which is available in 10, 16 and 22 percent concentrations.<br>  <br>  Whiteners that contain peroxide typically come in gel form and are placed in a mouthguard. Some products are used twice a day for 2 weeks while others are intended for overnight use for a 1 to 2 weeks period. If you can obtain the bleaching solution from your dentist, he will be able to construct a custom mouth guard to fit your teeth precisely. Currently, the American Dental Association endorses only dentist-dispensed home-use percent carbamide peroxide tray-applied gels. <br>  <br>  In addition to bleaching solution, whitening strips are increasingly being used as a preferred tooth whitening product. For instance, you are now able to get your hands on a set of Crest Whitestrips Supreme from any convenience store. The flexible, invisible strips are coated with an enamel-safe tooth bleaching gel. To whiten your teeth, you simply place the strips on your teeth and wear them for about 15 to 30 minutes each day. After a period of about 21 days, you should be able to see a significant difference on the brightness of your teeth. <br>  <br>  For other effective home teeth whitening solutions, you may wish to read about them here :  <a href="http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house.com/Articles/Home_Teeth_Whitening.php" rel="nofollow">http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house....</a>|`|bQCfOftxaa	crest white strips|`|a1KqdXLXaa	Crest white strips, they are inexpensive, safe and effective.  Some people will say brushing with soda, this is very harmful to the enamel as it is literally scratching away the outer layer to reveal a whiter layer below.  I know some toothpastes have soda in them but it is dramatically modified in order to make it safe.  Soda in a box is very coarse, go with the strips.|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Yeah crest whitening strips are amazing but for an even cheaper option use bleach...i know it sounds weird but my boyfs mum does it, she just puts kitchen roll round her gums and then whacks the bleach on...couldn't imagine its very safe but it does make a difference!<br>  <br>  Personally i'd go for the crest strips|`|qxWoiRHwaa	I would watch the vinegar as it strips the enamel off your teeth.<br>  Cheapest way is hydrogen peroxide mixed with salt and baking soda.

dpgXzMenaa	1) "Popping the cherry" is a cute but silly way to describe the bleeding that often happens when a girl's/woman's hymen is ruptured... and although that can happen in *many* ways, people seem to insist on reserving the term for the loss of virginity or the first time the girl has sex.<br>  <br>  Hymens can be ruptured by a great many other things, though, and a damaged hymen means absolutely nothing in terms of its owner's "virginity".<br>  <br>  No matter what state your hymen is in, you're a virgin until the first moment a penis begins to enter your vagina.<br>  <br>  2) You need tampons, or you need to change your pad aa *lot* more often.<br>  <br>  3) Easy: eat a little bit less and exercise a lot more.  That's the only safe, effective and more or less permanent way there *is* to lose weight and stay healthy while doing it.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Thums down for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?    Gee, *that's* helpful.  :-\|`|AA11635397	thats cute. Well politely, popping your cherry, in other words mean, usually your first time having sexual intercourse when your boyfriend/husband has sexs with you allowing him to go deep for the first time causing your hymen to break, the inside of your vagina. It just means you're doing grown folks stuff. Just be careful ok sweety. I'm not here to judge no one about how early it is to be having sex but just always USE PROTECTION ok sweety. Bye.|`|SHBpzAIZaa	I really think that you should talk with your mom or an adult that you trust and feel comfortable talking to about this... there is nothing to be embarrassed about as we all have to face all the wonderful things that come with being a woman sooner or later.

pqit18wBaa	I think teal and lime green would be really, really, really cute! There was this girl at my school who had it and it was really cool. A great way to check how it would look would be to use this Braces Color Selector preview: <a href="http://www.pbhs.com/ortho/braces/braces.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbhs.com/ortho/braces/braces....</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Just make sure you get something dark- food stains the lighter colored ones. And I would suggest NOT getting alternating colors- I had them and it just looks weird.<br>  <br>  Honey, no offense, but I think you would regret BOTH of those color choices. Why would you want something black in your teeth?  And the teal and lime green sound like they would clash horribly to me. I would suggest getting one single color...and stay as close as you can to the color of your brackets. If they are metal, get a gray. If they are ceramic, I don't know...'cause they will show food stains no matter what. That's what I had, and I regretted it pretty quickly.|`|cPTRlMJ8aa	okay.. first, no yellow cause they will look like a dental plaque. so gross. your mouth will look as though you havent brush your teeth in a month!<br>  <br>  and no black either cause they will look like a caries or a stain. not good.<br>  <br>  i will recommend red if you have a yellowish teeth cause red will make them look whiter. but if you have white teeth, u can use any colour other than yellow or black. teal/green is nice. but maybe not lime green, cause it's almost like yellow. actually, dark purple is very nice. not too girly girl. i prefer dark colour, but not black.|`|rao4C9Yxaa	Light blue looks good and doesn't stand out to much.<br>  Don't get gray because it makes your braces look bigger and more metaly.|`|s0wNYOZ2aa	teal and lime green.... *awesome* colors :D|`|vQWZx5Yuaa	good luck braces suck ***|`|LJ807vxzaa	I have braces and I always get the grey because they don't look that obvious, if I got a florescent pink it would bring attention to the braces but the grey blends in and doesn't look as conspicuous!|`|7E1WWRp1aa	pink are green i had my braces one for like a week and i got pink first to me it make my teeth look whiter and everyone say i look cute and young ...lol good luck...|`|mlUqRq6caa	you should get black, because it wont look dirty as much, and it looks much better.|`|BrjeoYvwaa	I get gray cause it doesn't get dirty or stand out too much.

P3LQn5mIaa	Personally I would not do any strenuous exercises at the  gym, but going to the gym and being active it probably a good thing for your knee to regain its strength, as long as your doctor approves.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are taking good care of things, so I would just be careful and take it easy at the gym, until the swelling goes down. As long as things to not get worse, go for it :)|`|049a5ee66231db2295d9daeba62a36bcaa	Just take it easy for awhile and if there is pain stop what you are doing.  I hope you are taking an anti inflammatory med, as this will help a lot.  Sounds like you are being smart, you'll be ok in a while.  Personally I would not work out and keep it elevated as much as possible also.|`|Zeb6RFeKaa	How long has it been since you hurt your knee and what kind of a doctor did you see? If it's been more than 2 or 3 days and it's still weak and swollen you should get a different opinion, preferably from a specialist and not a general care physician.<br>  <br>  Don't do anything to strain the joint. Go ahead and go to the gym but try to only work your upper body and let your leg rest. There's no point in risking injuring it further.|`|CmqOL5okaa	BOY, NO PAIN, NO GAIN. Go to the gym, thats just muscle pumping up, i remember i broke my leg, i still went to the gym, i even went to the gym when i hurt my back, you gotta be tough, its for your own good.

I'm 44, have arthritis (osteoarthritis) and in my back also--but not in severe pain enough to require a patch
LJkPRqN0aa	yup im doing that right now and have lost 2 pant sizes already, so yes you can if not weight, definately sizes....|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  I have answered this question so many times that I now just copy and paste my story !<br>  If you want to loose fat, I suggest eating a well balanced diet.<br>  Grilled or baked lean meats, fruits, fiber, vegetables, water and un - salted nuts. <br>  Exercise 5 days of the week, alternating with cardio and strength training. Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods. You will not over indulge, after 2 weeks of eating a well balanced diet, on the 2 off days you have, you will not want as much junk food. <br>  <br>  I lost 105 pounds in 1 year by eating this this way.|`|NwdvjsWXaa	Yes if you use up more calories than you eat (don't exercise to burn up more kcals than you eat as your body burns loads just keeping you alive, digestion etc)<br>  Watch what you eat as well and you should, and varying exercise helps too|`|i57jmYXxaa	running for a half hour burns like 300+ calories.<br>  and there are 3500 calories in a pound, so you gotta run everynight for 12nights, to loose 1 pound.<br>  <br>  ive lost 14,<br>  but only ran 15.<br>  and workouts.|`|cZrbAiUIaa	You probably will. But you have to change other aspects of your life. Eat more balanced meals and that along with running should definitely help.|`|5vtZVLdIaa	you need a combination of exersice and eating right. but do not be trying to loose weight if your under 130 that would be called being a stupid girl|`|sjwNNWBCaa	Running alone isn't going to make you lose weight.<br>  It will help, though.<br>  <br>  You also need to focus on eating habits.<br>  If you go running, and then go to mcdonals for a cheeseburger meal,<br>  well there was just no point in running was there?<br>  <br>  Keep running, and watch what you eat.<br>  You'll begin to lose and tone :)
WPVpOfuwaa	No, I have not heard of anyone ever getting injections. <br>  I would not  recommend yellow. <br>  Maybe blue?|`|JO3j4fpXaa	No you don't have to have an injection when you get your braces fitted.<br>  You just sit back and your dentist will place 'little squares' onto your teeth which will stick on with a gluey substance.<br>  It doesn't hurt and it's all worthwhile in the end :)<br>  <br>  The range of colours is really good.<br>  At my dentist you can have up to 2 colours at the same time and you get to change the colour everytime you get your brace tightened.<br>  I'd say red is probably the worst colour because it can fade to pink and if your not a girly girl then I'm guessing you would want pink! Yellow is also a big NO! As you can look as if you have really dirty teeth. Green too as you'll look like you have food in between your teeth. Not Pleasant :P<br>  <br>  So yeah hope I've helped and if you have any more questions on braces then believe me I'm an expert! So feel feel to mail me or what not. :)|`|lcXtN4aLaa	no you wont need injections, the actual fitting of the brace doesnt hurt at all, its just a weird sensation in your mouth afterwards. I had an injection in the roof of my mouth when i had a touth out, and the injection hurt alot more than fitting a brace anyway.<br>  Good luck with the braces, at first it will seem horrible, but i swear they're worth it in the end.<br>  Pink was my favourite but if your not girly then maybe a bad idea, bright green made my teeth look whitest. I just had plain silver ones alot of the time, you'll find that the colours fade between getting them changed, and then they dont look so good.|`|YXeX2LtNaa	i used to have braces and i didn't have to have injections when it was fitted, but i did when i had to have teeth taken out to give my teeth room to move.|`|rao4C9Yxaa	Nope no injections, honestly it really doesnt hurt that much.<br>  Light blue looks REALLY good, well for braces anyway =]|`|8fvBN4kxaa	yes you have one to make your teeth sleep|`|eVk8yPy2aa	No when I had braces fitted about 5 years ago they didn't give me any injections. It doesn't hurt at all when your having them fitted, it hurts alot afterwards though as they start pulling your teeth straight. For the first couple of days afterwards they will suggest you take some ibuprofen and paracetamol to ease the discomfort. You can rub Bonjela on your gums aswel. I had loads of different colours my favourite was probably when I had every colour possible! Bit girly but it looked cool! I also had purple and torquoise, black and yellow, orange and pink and red and orange all those colours look really cool!!|`|jPA0CA7aaa	i got my braces when i was 11 and at first your teeth are sore but that is why my parents bought be a bunch of soft stuff and it is only for a week that it is sore and there are no injections at all .and the colors i got were purple and blue and trust me dont sneak any sticky foods if you do  you will end up like my friends and have to have them longer and have to pay extra money btw i didnt eat any sticky stuff and i got them off in 2 years and my teeth look great!!! hope you have a great experience|`|N8cAwzxzaa	I never had any except when I had a tooth removed, and that was to numb my mouth and done at the dentists, rather than the orthodontists. <br>  Braces aren't very painful, just achy. Avoid purple and  dark blue with the colours, and yellow. They make your teeth look horrible. Black and white look dodgy as well. <br>  Red and luminous green look alright, and paler blues.|`|mlUqRq6caa	No, they do not give any injections, not for the braces fitting.<br>  If you are having a tooth pulled, then they will give you anesthesia.|`|2fYyw4LBaa	I had braces for 4 years and not once did I have any kind of injections... You wont experience any kind of pain that you'd need a local anesthetic.|`|a1KqdXLXaa	No, you don't
DCF8C71paa	The chances are that it doesn't fit because your teeth have moved back. If you got remolded, it would be for the way your teeth are now...crooked. So your best bet would be to stick with the one you have and take tylenol for the pain, in a bout a week or two, your teeth should be moved back. It happens to me all the time.|`|a1KqdXLXaa	Yes, you can but it will maintain the tooth position you have now.  In order to move the teeth back you will need ortho again.|`|NZW630MPaa	I believe so, yeah when i don't were mine for acupple days my teeth feel like they've moved. So yes i believe your ortho dontist has to do so if you show em it doesn't fit right.

It progresses in stages and without treatment, can lead to death.<br>  [Return to Top]<br>  How is syphilis spread?<br>  <br>  Syphilis can be spread during vaginal, anal, or oral sex through contact with an open sore or contact with a skin rash. The bacteria can enter the body through the penis, anus, vagina, mouth, or through broken skin. An infected pregnant woman can also pass the disease to her unborn child. Syphilis is not spread by contact with toilet seats, doorknobs, swimming pools, hot tubs, bathtubs, shared clothing, or eating utensils.<br>  [Return to Top]<br>  What are the symptoms of syphilis?<br>  <br>  Each stage of syphilis has different symptoms. Syphilis can be spread during the first two stages of the disease.<br>  <br>  Primary Stage<br>  A single, painless sore, called a chancre (shan-ker), appears in the first, or primary stage, about 10 days to 90 days after infection. The sore can appear on the vulva, vagina, cervix, tongue, lips, or other parts of the body, including inside the body. Twenty-one days after infection is the most common time frame in which the sore appears. The sore heals with or without treatment. In this stage, syphilis can be passed to others through contact with an open sore during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If the infection is not treated, it moves to the next, or secondary, stage.<br>  <br>  Secondary Stage<br>  In the secondary stage, which starts three to six weeks after the sore appears, some or all of these symptoms can appear:<br>  <br>      * skin rash with rough, red or reddish-brown spots both on the palms of the hands and bottoms of the feet. The rash usually does not itch. Rashes with a different appearance may occur on other parts of the body.<br>      * sores on the throat, mouth, or cervix<br>      * fever<br>      * sore throat and swollen lymph glands<br>      * patchy hair loss on the head and other parts of the body<br>      * headaches and muscle aches<br>      * weight loss<br>      * tiredness<br>  <br>  During vaginal, anal, or oral sex, contact with open sores or contact with the rash can spread the infection to others. The symptoms of secondary syphilis will resolve with or without treatment. But without treatment, the infection will progress to the latent and late stages of disease.<br>  <br>  Latent Stage<br>  The next stage is called the latent or hidden stage. This stage can start from two years to over thirty years after initial infection. After symptoms from the secondary stage disappear, a relapse of the second stage of syphilis can happen, when those symptoms come back. If a relapse happens, the disease can be passed to others. Otherwise, the disease cannot be passed to another person. Even without treatment, some people with latent syphilis do not go on to develop late stage syphilis. But others will go on to develop late stage syphilis.<br>  <br>  Late Stage<br>  In the late stage of syphilis, some people suffer damage to the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints. Complications may include small bumps or tumors on organs, blindness, insanity, or paralysis. This stage can last for years. Some people may die from the disease. You will only reach this stage if you have not received treatment earlier. If you have syphilis, get treated as soon as possible to avoid these problems.<br>  [Return to Top]<br>  How is syphilis diagnosed?<br>  <br>  A doctor can diagnose syphilis in a number of ways:<br>  <br>      * Recognizing its signs and symptoms and taking the correct tests.<br>      * Looking at the fluid from a syphilis sore or swollen lymph node under a microscope. This can only be done during primary and secondary syphilis when a patient has sores.<br>      * Testing the patient’s blood.<br>  <br>  [Return to Top]<br>  Can syphilis be cured? How is syphilis treated?<br>  <br>  Yes, syphilis can be cured. Penicillin is the preferred drug to treat syphilis at all stages. The dose and length of treatment depends on the stage of syphilis and symptoms of the disease. If a person can’t take penicillin, another medicine may be available. But in late syphilis, damage already done to body organs cannot be reversed. You can get syphilis again after being cured if you are exposed to it. Taking antibiotics does not protect you from getting syphilis again.<br>  [Return to Top]<br>  What should I do if I have syphilis?<br>  <br>      * Avoid having any sexual activity while you are being treated for syphilis. Don’t have sexual contact until the syphilis sores are completely healed.<br>      * Be sure to tell your sexual partners, so they can be tested and treated if necessary.<br>      * After you have completed treatment for syphilis, get retested after six months and 12 months. Some doctors recommend more frequent follow-up tests.<br>  <br>  [Return to Top]<br>  Can syphilis cause problems during pregnancy?<br>  <br>  Yes. Pregnant women can pass syphilis to their babies during pregnancy and childbirth. It can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or death soon after birth. An infected baby may be born without signs of disease. However, if not treated right away, the baby may have serious problems within a few weeks. Babies born with syphilis may develop skin sores, rashes, fever, jaundice (yellow skin), anemia (a blood problem), or a swollen liver and spleen. Untreated babies may become developmentally delayed, have seizures, or die.<br>  <br>  All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis. Pregnant women with syphilis are treated right away with penicillin. For women with an allergy to penicillin, there is no alternative medicine that has proven effective for treatment. Penicillin will prevent passing syphilis to the baby, although treatment during the second half of pregnancy may not eliminate the risk for premature labor and fetal distress.<br>  [Return to Top]<br>  How is syphilis prevented?<br>  <br>  There are things you can do to protect yourself from syphilis:<br>  <br>      * Don’t have sex. The best way to prevent syphilis or any STD is to practice abstinence, or not having vaginal, oral, or anal sex.<br>      * Be faithful. Have a sexual relationship with one partner who has been tested for syphilis and is not infected is another way to reduce your chances of getting infected. Be faithful to each other, meaning that you only have sex with each other and no one else.<br>      * Use condoms. Protect yourself with a condom EVERY time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. For vaginal sex, use a latex male condom or a female polyurethane condom. For anal sex, use a latex male condom. For oral sex, use a dental dam. A dental dam is a rubbery material that can be placed over the anus or the vagina before sexual contact.<br>      * Know that some methods of birth control, like birth control pills, shots, implants, or diaphragms, will not protect you from STDs. If you use one of these methods, be sure to also use a latex condom or dental dam (used for oral sex) correctly every time you have sex.<br>      * Talk with your sex partner(s) about STDs and using condoms. It’s up to you to make sure you are protected. Remember, it’s YOUR body! For more information, call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at (800) 232-4636.<br>      * Talk frankly with your doctor or nurse and your sex partner(s) about any STDs you or your partner have or had. Talk about any sores in the genital area. Try not to be embarrassed. Being honest could save your lives.<br>      * Have regular pelvic exams. Talk with your doctor about how often you need them. Many tests for STDs can be done during an exam. Ask your doctor to test you for syphilis and other STDs. The sooner an STD is found, the easier it is to treat.<br>      * If you are pregnant, get tested for syphilis. Get tested as soon as you think you may be pregnant.<br>  <br>  [Return to Top]<br>  For More Information<br>  <br>  You can find out more about syphilis by contacting the National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC) at 800-994-WOMAN or the following organizations.<br>  <br>  CDC Info, HHS<br>  Phone: (800) CDC-INFO or (800) 232-4636<br>  <br>  CDC National Prevention Information Network (NPIN), CDC, HHS<br>  Phone: (800) 458-5231<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.cdcnpin.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdcnpin.org</a><br>  <br>  National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention, CDC, HHS<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/std</a><br>  <br>  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases<br>  Phone: (301) 496-5717<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/stds.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/st...</a><br>  <br>  American Social Health Association<br>  Phone: (800) 783-9877<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.ashastd.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ashastd.org</a><br>  <br>  Planned Parenthood Federation of America<br>  Phone: (800) 230-7526<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org</a><br>  <br>  The syphilis FAQ was reviewed by the Division of STD Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|`|AA10470911	Honestly, if you have to ask this question...you need serious psychological counseling.

Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods.

If you have food packed between your teeth, it's decaying, causing bad breath.<br>  Here's a tip for brushing your tongue... first stick out your tongue as far as you can and brush your tongue all the way back using a small amount of toothpaste on your toothbrush. Hold your breath while your brushing the tongue to help prevent gagging. ALSO,  brush the tissue inside of your mouth. (the inside of your cheeks). It sounds weird but trust me, that will help.|`|3dzuYTC5aa	Either you eat way to much pizza, garlic items, maybe chips and italian foods can all give you bad breathe. <br>  And you need to brush your teeth better if your not eating the above then your not brushing right.....

U6C4Bywwaa	4 months to lose 30 lbs? Sure! It can be done but will take hard work! First, start with your eating habits. You're going to want to limit yourself to 1300-1600 cals per day. You should be eating no junk or fast food and no soda. Eat lots of fruits/veggies, protein, whole grains. Drink a ton of watre. Like at least 80 oz. or more if you can. Chew sugar free gum if you feel hungry between meals. You also need to exercise. You should do some sort of cardio exercise for an hour 5 days a week. I would suggest jogging. If you cant jog the whole hour, then do like 5 mins fast walking, 5 mins jogging, back to walking, back to joging, etc. Good luck?|`|BJy7g6raaa	yeah but you have to exercise literally everyday and go on a severe diet.|`|c4cb310732bdbbcd88cc2b8cf1011b2caa	Yes it is possible to lose 30 lbs by June.<br>  <br>  What you should do is first prepare your body for the change. Do a 7 day detox diet like the cabbage soup diet which will clean out your body of processed foods and chemicals. This week alone can help you lose up to 10 lbs. Many people say this type of diet is a fad diet. However that is because 99% of people usually end up eating the same as they did before the diet after they have completed the 7 days thus adding back the weight they lost.<br>  <br>  By following a healthy eating plan after the 7 days not only will you maintain your lose you will continue to lose more. By this stage (week 2) you should be aiming to lose around 2lbs a week. Although for the first few weeks you may lose more. <br>  <br>  Do not cut out food groups in your diet as the key to losing weight and being healthy is about eating a wide range of healthy foods. Good carbs, veggies, fruit, protiens, calcium.<br>  <br>  If you need another motivation boost during your diet try another week of cabbage soup.<br>  <br>  Make sure your exercising regular and try to walk for about 30 minutes a day (this can be broken in to 10 minutes 3 times a day. However it suits best into your lifestyle. Drink plenty of water.

Good luck in the future.<br>  <br>  The physical effects of a miscarriage tend to clear up quickly. Any bleeding usually settles down within 7 to 10 days, and your next period is likely to follow between four and six weeks later. Sometimes infection can make the bleeding last longer or cause an offensive discharge. If this happens, a course of antibiotics can be prescribed and this will usually clear it up quickly.<br>  The emotional impact of miscarriage can be greater. Grief is a natural reaction to miscarriage and it is normal for it to be as intense as that after any other bereavement. Many women describe a feeling of numbness and emptiness following a miscarriage. Some withdraw, feeling alone and isolated, others may wish to talk about it.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	This does not sound normal but I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.

First, we have the ingestible ones, or the acne products which you could take in via the mouth.  Second, we have the external or topical acne products which are applied to the outer layer of the skin.<br>  <br>  Of the first group of acne products are pills like antibiotics.  Antibiotics reinforce our antibodies, and lead to a better protection of our system against harmful bacteria that, when added with oil, would cause acne.  Antibiotics, however, should be taken in moderation.  Too much of the same would make our antibodies immune to their reinforcing effects.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and supplements are also popular ingestible acne products.  If you want a natural way of preventing acne breakout, then let your body do the work by merely supplementing it with these types of acne products.  Vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E are great for the skin.  Protein would also help improve the rejuvenating properties of the same.<br>  <br>  In the second group of acne products belong cleansing creams and liquids.  Most of these contain salicylic acid and benzoyl perocide, both of which are very effective in treating acne.  The problem with these ingredients, however, is that they can be too astringent for some people.  They may get rid of excess oil, but they dry up the skin too much, resulting in other forms of skin disorders.  <br>  <br>  For other effective remedies for acne treatment, you can read abt them here: <a href="http://acne.best-health-remedy.com/" rel="nofollow">http://acne.best-health-remedy.com/</a>|`|rBATSpC5aa	I went to doctors 'cause i had a bit of acne for like 4 years, since I was 13.

No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com|`|h6cBDEhaaa	Don't tell her she's stupid, please.

It can take years for the body to adjust to such a reversal in living.|`|a1D9KJNFaa	There can be many causes for your problem.   As a former sleep technologist who worked nights doing sleep studies, I have seen many people with problems related to sleep.    Most likely cause is distractions that interrupt your sleep during the day.   Noises, lack of darkness, a radio, a tv, all can cause small awakenings that you are unaware of.    It would be useful to have a little more information, though.  How long have you been on the night shift, do you switch shifts frequently, do you snore, do you have any other physical symptoms like snoring, strange feelings in your legs or feet, sleep walking?   Do you sleep with a partner, have animals in the house/bedroom?|`|aa673f8d0b3f8397baf3af4288720b12aa	Our circadian clocks are set so that we should sleep at night when dark and be awake in daylight. It is difficult for our bodies to get used to the other way round.  It is harder to get the depth of sleep during the day time than we get at night.  That's why its so hard for shift workers to feel rested.

Sacroiliac and coccygeal (tail bone) pain can be similar to the discomfort of uterine descensus ("fallen womb").

yPLS0FeWaa	Yes, a good place to start would be the link left by Flapore. The link is in Reference to Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who is the doctor who associated the MMR vaccine as to causing autism in a report released in 1998 and published in The Lancet, it was later found that he fixed the results and most of those children in the research had signs of autism documented in their medical records before they received the MMR shot.  He is currently facing charges in court. <br>  Here's a couple more links about it: On either page you'll also find a link on the left to a timeline.<br>  <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_an...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_an...</a><br>  <br>  I would try to do a search on thimerosal (maybe the history of it or thimerosal link to autism or something like that, if you haven't already tried that), besides the MMR vaccine, thimersoal which is a mercury additive that use to be added to vaccines as a preservative to prevent contamination was also considered to be linked to causing autism.  It has not be placed in vaccines since 2001 with the exception of the flu vaccine which you can get with or without thimerosal. Many think thimerosal was in the MMR vaccine, but it never has been.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	if you are writing a paper, you need to do the research yourself, suggest you google "Autism and vaccines".|`|8ryoShBpaa	If Andy Wakefield is so powerful as to publish one paper and get a million parents to believe it, than he must be the most powerful person on Earth.  Parents think vaccines are related to autism because they see it first-hand.  You don't see a million people believing any other study published.  As a matter of fact, studies in general have lost their credibility.  Some study is published in another country in a journal most parents have never read, and all of a sudden, Dr. Wakefield convinced the world to not get the MMR -- NOT!  The link began when parents got on this Internet and starting talking to each other on what they PERSONALLY seen and started putting things together.  They then further researched things, and ended up finding doctors who really could help their children.  My children no longer have autism.  It is rid by ridding pathogens and toxins, some of which are found in the vaccines.  Parents and doctors who are reversing autism are the ONLY ones who have credibility.  Basically, you have a choice.  To either listen to the people who are successfully ridding children of autism or people who are not.  I chose to listen to the ones who have the success, and now my children no longer have autism.  <br>  <br>  You can google and find studies which do show a link; there are gobs of them.  I have read many of them.  But, who can pay attention to studies, when they are so contradictory.  I just plain pay attention to people who achieved success, and did what they did.  If you really want all that information, you can go to the Yahoo Groups on autism and ask there, and they will tell you all about it.|`|vWm1l9nuaa	This site: <a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm</a> may be a good place to start.
3Yg14Jxfaa	Anxiety doesn't cause persistent high blood pressure (hypertension). But episodes of anxiety can cause dramatic, temporary spikes in your blood pressure.<br>  <br>  If those temporary episodes occur frequently, they can cause just as much damage to your blood vessels, heart and kidneys as can chronic high blood pressure. In addition, when you have anxiety, you're more likely to resort to other unhealthy habits, such as smoking, drinking or overeating — which, in turn, can increase your risk of high blood pressure.<br>  <br>  See a mental health professional if you can.|`|59iSPST0aa	Anxiety can cause many problems in your body.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Anxiety IS the feeling of worry and nervousness.

HHPha1J0aa	It sounds very balanced and healthy to me!<br>  I wish i could do better haha..maybe you could give me a few pointersx!|`|a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to: <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum and is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat (equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bar(awesome snack, 150 calories, 10g of protein! 3g fiber you can not do better, also comes in Peanut Butter and Chocolate), Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle).<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snack or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Smaller but more. Each smaller snacks more often instead of big meals. This really does work and will definately increase your metabolism. I eat a South Beach Cereal Bar every 2 hours all day then a good dinner. They keep me full and they taste pretty good. Caffiene is your friend. It is a natural appetite suppressant so have that cup of coffee!<br>  <br>  Step 7: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 8(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 9: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 10: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that will distract you for a half an hour so that your will can reassert itself and help you to make a rational decision.

My friend is afraid of needles, and she fainted. So, make sure you relax. All you feel is a pinch at first, and then you feel the stuff oozing inside of you. It don't hurt for long, and if you're really nervous, it will hurt more because you're all tense. Also, your arm might hurt 30-60 mins after the injection. By this I mean pain or heavyness. But just relax, and it should be fine :)|`|wCsCbYkxaa	i have had 2, so far, and my third is due anytime soon, it doesn't hurt much, depends on the person, however waiting there makes u really nervous, and i hate needles too but i'd ratherr have a bit of pain in my arm, wouldnt you? you may have a bit of pain in the arm for a few hours but its worth it :)|`|qfnWZ3twaa	its like a little POKE then its over.. not very painful a little numb after but its worth it.. i think the last one hurt the most.. different for everyone|`|LfyaujQAaa	its not that bad, don't worry you'll be fine.<br>  i hate needles also but i got it and i barely even cried (and i cry for everything!) so really don't worry.<br>  <br>  if you need to talk you can email me..<br>  hope i helped! :)|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	It's a minuscule pinprick! There is a limitation to how much a thin needle can actually hurt. You are worrying over nothing. The anticipation is a lot worse than the actual injection which is all over in seconds.

ArVCMN3faa	Im not seeing it either,<br>  you have a amazing <br>  stomach.|`|Y1avZXOfaa	you are crazy.<br>  that is not fat.<br>  <br>  >_<|`|S7Q3fRvoaa	You are not fat at all!  your stomach is perfectly flat!  I think you look fabulous!<br>  <br>  But if you want to improve your abs even more, here are a few exericses.  Regular crunches are good,but they only work a few parts of the abdomen.  To work your obliques (muscles down the side of the stomach), try sideways bicycle crunches.  Or, take a dumbell in each hand ( i usually use 5 or 8 pounds) and move from side to side, only moving your stomach muscles.  Keep everything else still.<br>  <br>  Another great ab exercise is the plank.  Lie on the floor, face down with legs straight behind you, and prop yourself up on your elbows.  Keep your head down and your body parallel to the floor.<br>  <br>  One last exercise thats great for working the abs is this.  Lie on the floor, face up.  Keeping your legs straight, slowly lift them to a 90 degree angle and lower them slowly, but dont allow your feet to touch the ground!  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!! :)|`|lHynYc4Aaa	Haha the second pic is funny how you highlighted out the "fat" which doesn't exist!! You could do crunches if you want but I don't see a problem!|`|ProDw5xAaa	It's hard. Been trying to get rid of it myself. Told to do a lot of fat burning exersise.|`|62CyxnZuaa	are u kidding me?<br>  that aint belly fat!!<br>  u should see mine...<br>  ugh.<br>  lol.<br>  i dont think u need to get rid of it i think it looks fine(:|`|ethmRAiLaa	go to the gym|`|ohFvHdp6aa	Honestly, I don't see anything wrong with it. You look to be a healthy weight and size.<br>  However, if nothing can stop you from wanting to burn off that (nonexistent) belly fat, I suggest leaner meats (if you eat meat) and more vegetable. Some vegetables that can help burn fat are celery, broccoli, cabbage, root vegetables like carrots and potatos, and spinach. It's also best to eat them raw (but cook your potatoes!).<br>  A couple of good excersizes for burning fat are also walking and crunches. Sit-ups may seem like they help, but in reality crunches are far more effective because they cause the muscles to work harder by not bringing yourself all the way off the ground. Walking burns those extra calories without too much of a sweat, and also helps to tone and tighten your leg muscles. Fifty crunches a day and half an hour of walking combined with a healthy diet low in saturated fats will work wonders (not that I think you need it).|`|PG77jlimaa	OMG. Look at that fat. Yo fat lady, u need to stop eating soo much.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  It's hardly noticeable. You have nothing to worry about. You could look up some fad diet. But, I would advice against it. <br>  <br>  Go burn more calories in the gym then you eat. Let there be a 600 calorie deficit. That fat will run away holding its fallen shorts.|`|dhr7nnxoaa	Dont lose anymore weight!!!OMG your so skinny you look perfect and only being 110 lbs it is NOT healthy to lose anymore.Be happy with your weight.GOOD LUCK:-)|`|HsrRNnIBaa	You have no fat.

CNW6eAjoaa	First of all, if the lady that said to cut the rest of it off would like to volunteer to set the example, and undergo female circumcision without pain reduction, she would have better credentials to answer your question.  Ignore the comments to cut it off. <br>  The wound you have will leave a small, non noticeable scar, but the thing is, it will be non elastic scar tissue.  This means the scar will not stretch when you want to retract your foreskin.  One small scar will not make a big difference, but I think if you tore your skin, it means you might need to do some foreskin stretches to loosen it first.<br>  Follow the stretches laid out in the first link below, and do some reading in the other links.  Start out in a shower or bath and let the warm water loosen and relax your skin.  Begin with the stretch where you pull your skin away from your body, foreward off the end of your penis.  This will help to break up the bond of connective tissue that holds your glans and foreskin together since birth.  Follow the stretches as described.  You will see information there about not over stretching, and a bit about scar tissue.  Pay attention to the warning about not stretching until you feel pain.<br>  As an alternative, you can go to a docotr and tell him/her you need a steroid cream to help loosen a tight foreskin.  There are several made for this purpose.  If the doctor even breathes the word: circumcision, be very firm and say it is not an option.  You might need to find another doctor.<br>  Circumcision is the last thing you need.  Getting cut for this would be like curing a cold with a hand gun.  The results would be devastating.<br>  Good luck with this.  Feel free to write to me if you require more information.|`|E64juLwJaa	No you will hardly see it<br>  So do not worry.<br>  But it is time you try to stretch your foreskin,so this will not happen anymore,<br>  Colors.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	Try not to masturbate for a few days, or if you do, be very gentle. You shouldn't get much of a scar.<br>  Is your foreskin tight? if so, you may need to stretch it, especially since at your age, your penis is growing.<br>  Do it in the bath or shower - the hot water helps to soften the skin.<br>  Insert a clean finger under the foreskin, and gently stretch it - don't do it so much that it hurts, as this can cause micro tears, that then heal with scars - not what you want.<br>  It will take several weeks before you see any results, but keep it up daily and you'll get there<br>  Pulling the foreskin back whenever you pee will help, as will masturbating.<br>  Hope this helps|`|vmCkQFbLaa	thats why circumcision is a must for dudes..lol.<br>  ok dont masturbate for now, if you have vaseline or neosporin, i would apply that (pea size amount) twice a day..it'll heal<br>  if your partner says that then screw them this is your health damnit!|`|GCjFPehGaa	cut the rest of it off.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	don't worry about a scar... by the time you have someone that close to it there won't be a scar.<br>  USE MORE LUBE!|`|GvEsaVYeaa	Is it torn because of the foreskin being too tight? If so, then you need to stretch it. If it isn't too tight, then maybe you need to use lubrication. If you aren't using your hands, maybe you need to start.<br>  As to whether or not it will leave a scar, you can only know once it heals, and if it does, don't worry about it. No-one will look at your penis and look for any marks, don't let it get you paranoid about it.|`|QxCVRGQLaa	This happened to me to it went away after a week or so and it DID NOT leave a scar.

510MC9SVaa	I had the same thing done 15 years ago and for the next 9 years I had sex with no other protection. I didn't get pregnant. That being said, no protection is 100% failsafe.

She's just not ready to have a baby ok!!? I mean hey! You people also criticize birth Control pills, so maybe she doesn't want to have a baby why don't you just quite biting down peoples necks about it! And to actually answer the question, Id say about 3-4 weeks, if your still not sure just call your doctor!|`|grPckwSsaa	they told my friend 4 weeks|`|aQ8o4w3Xaa	Don't have sex for at least 6 weeks. They say 5, but it's best to wait an extra week just to make sure 100% that you won't get infected or anything will go wrong. <br>  When you do have sex, be gentle and stop if it hurts at all. It can be a bit much at first. <br>  What did they tell you at the clinic? Follow whatever advise they gave you to the letter. Getting an infection could give you some big problems. Remember, you can always call them if you have any questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  - K.<br>  <br>  EDIT: As for all the bitchy answers, forget about them. They don't have a clue.

HMKiEJ45aa	No.<br>  Its the long term effect from prozac that will make you feel better. Probably wouldnt even be a week until you started feeling different and if/when you do decide to stop it's best to wean yourself off.  Your body will just be confused if you only take it during random moods. Possibly more harm than good. <br>  I wouldn't bother with it. Maybe meditate, isolate yourself when youre feeling bitchy, or do some yoga to calm your nerves. Herbal teas are nice too. Good luck.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	No you need to take it on a regular basis or it can do you more harm than good.
XSu3dedGaa	You're at school, the most you're going to use unless you're a sixth former is a 1 molar solution of hydrochloric acid, burns using 1 molar are generally minor unless you spilt a whole bottle on yourself and don't need medical attention.<br>  <br>  The moment the acid came into contact with your skin you should have washed your hand and left it under the water for a while, just like a normal burn.<br>  <br>  It's going to be sore and red for a bit, just like any other burn, but it doesn't need a doctor, you can treat it yourself.<br>  <br>  "Every year I impress my students by pouring 1M HCl into the palm of my hand and then holding it there fore a minute or two. The skin on the palm of the hand is composed of dead cells and doesn't react with HCl. The reason that HCl is annoying on your skin is that it is absorbed into the skin and interacts with live cells. The live cells respond to the solution with a pH that is damaging to cell biology, so they notify the brain via the nerve cells that the owner of the skin has done something stupid, like pour 1M HCl on his hand." - Straight from the mouth of a chemistry teacher<br>  <br>  Remember that your stomach is full of 0.1M hydrochloric acid and that's what your skin comes in contact with when you vomit. And while you usually wash your skin after vomiting, such a spoilage is hardly dangerous. And they use sodium hydroxide to 'peel' off the skin of canned tangerines (which is later neutralized with hydrochloric acid). They used 2.5 M for half an hour.<br>  <br>  You'll be fine, you'll just have a sore hand for a while.<br>  Unless you're a sixth - former where you can legally use up to 10 molar solutions of HCl, the acid you used isn't going to harm you and doesn't warrant seeing your doctor.|`|H04xPZViaa	If the skin is broken and it looks like it has become redder then it was when it first happened..<br>  then go see a doctor.<br>  But if not there is no need, Just be careful with it and don't leave it in hot water for too long.. <br>  and mabey bandage it.|`|rPbyDmjYaa	Yes you should seek medical attention immediately. If you are  a student I am not sure why the teacher didn't do that.
1h7lAJ8Daa	No baby can ever replace the baby that you aborted- and to have another baby in its place is just wrong! You should have a baby because it's what you and your husband both want and you want to provide a loving and caring family. <br>  <br>  Perhaps, what you should be asking yourself is why did you have an abortion? When you know the answer, you can apply it to a new baby. Will you feel the same as last time?<br>  <br>  You might speak to your husband and talk it through with him. Or, a doctor, or even a religous minister depending upon what faith you are.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, Best Wishes and God Bless xx|`|ySj7IeW0aa	have a baby, you are blessed because you are married, my sister had an abortion with the man she loved because of pressure from the family and still regrets it till this day but she had a full term baby with the same man and I think it took away some of the pain.<br>  <br>  have a baby, and all the best.|`|QSaEs0weaa	If you already had an abortion, that means you didn't feel as if you were ready to be a mother.

Why do you regret it? What's changed now, a month later? Will a baby really make things better? Is your situation a good place to raise a child? Are you prepared for the financial, physical and emotional costs of pregnancy?<br>  <br>  You can wait a little longer to have a baby - you can't put it off once it's already conceived. Best to think about these things first.

82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	How old are you? 125 is NOT a bad weight if you're under the age of 18 (which I'm guessing you are if you're having to ask this question) unless you're only 3 feet tall.<br>  <br>  That being said, starving is a BAD idea. You might lose a lot at first, but eventually your metabolism will go waaaay down, and your body will go into starvation mode and save EVERY calorie. The weight you will lose won't be fat, but muscle. You won't have any energy, and your mood will be rotten. It will even affect your grades. Starving is NOT the way to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Besides, just because your friends *seem* fine, that doesn't necessarily mean they ARE fine. Starving yourself can do major damage to your kidneys, liver, and other internal organs, and you won't even notice it until it's too late.

They ended up ganing back more than they lost. For friend 1 the only way I see that working is if she JUST started eating again and/or is eating extremely healthy. Also, crash dieting usually leads to loss of muscle rather than fat.<br>  <br>  I would not recommend. It is very unhealthy for you! I would recommend switching to a healthier diet rather than not eating at all.
u3NJaMaNaa	Hey!<br>  <br>  I have had diabetes for 13 years<br>  I am 15 years old<br>  I was diagnosed at the age of two, November 1st(?), 1995<br>  I am type one diabetic<br>  <br>  So... Lemme ask you some questions! Are you on a pump or shots? And if you are on a pump, what kind is it?|`|PevA05Ayaa	Hi!<br>  I have had diabetes (Type 1) for about the same amount of time you have, and I feel like I am just now starting to get the hang of it (some days!)<br>  <br>  The only difference is that I am 32 years old, and I got it when I was an adult.<br>  <br>  I've often wondered, while it is tough at any age, do you think it is harder to adjust to living with diabetes when you are a kid or a grown up?<br>  <br>  On the one hand, I figure it is hard that you could never just go hog wild at Halloween or your birthday, but on the other hand, if you have been diabetic for basically as long as you can remember, maybe it has been easier to start with and keep good habits?<br>  <br>  for me, I don't have parents nagging me to be good, but I also don't have parents helping me when things go bad.  It is tough to change old habits when it is something you have done your whole life.  And, there aren't any camps or anything to help you when you are a grown up, you are expected to figure out everything on your own.<br>  <br>  What are your thoughts?|`|PR6w9XzAaa	how long have you had it? 18 years<br>  How old are you? 19<br>  And when were you diagnosed? at a year old<br>  And if your like type 1 or type 2? type 1|`|96agLgIjaa	Ive had it for a little more than 4 years.<br>  Was diagnosed on Jan 28, 2005.<br>  Type one.<br>  BTW im 11, diagnosed at 7|`|AA12242211	I've had it for 5 years.<br>  I'm 20<br>  Diagnosed November 2003<br>  type 1
1xZgm49faa	stay up all day instead of going to bed at 4, and eat no junk food or sugar, and you'll be tired by six pm and then you go to bed at like 8 or 9.|`|UNCwyknbaa	have a nap in the day for about half an hour  it helps
BRDqfAy3aa	the best secure contraception is Dual Contraception (pills+condoms) which can prevent possible pregnancy and all STDs (red below)|`|h5xSfcT6aa	well the pill is about 96%-97% effective when used correctly. so theres not really any need. <br>  you could use condoms around ovulation time - 10-14 days after your period, as this is the time when you are most likely to get pregnant. just as a back up.<br>  xxx|`|GCjFPehGaa	i did at the beginning but then and my bf and I decided that it was okay not to use them because i'm incredibly diligent about my birth control and never miss it. EVER|`|zp0DpAataa	To be on the safe side i would use them with your pill..why run the risk of an unwanted pregnancy or sti just because you think they suck? They only state to be 99% effective..there's always that 1% chance!|`|lRTKmHU4aa	its not necessary but recommended. birth Control is only 99% effective.|`|yyIVrngcaa	not really...even though i should >_<<br>  i trust loestrin though...so far its done its job..|`|G3Xf0i0Eaa	We dont, but we've been tested and no std's or infections, and if we do end up pregnant it wont be the end of the world.<br>  <br>  If I wasnt in a relationship, and on the pill (using not just for contraception btw), then of course, condoms would be needed and probably up until about a year into a relationship.<br>  <br>  But in our situation, nope.<br>  <br>  If it feels right to you two not to use them, and you dont mind if you get pregnant then sure, why not not use them. It works out cheaper than buying condoms and theres no worries if you dont have any on you.|`|9a8557PAaa	you should still use a condom as the pill is only 99%  effective and people have gotten pregnant on the pill b4. Also by using a condom, you are protecting yourself from getting any diseases.|`|tkYndBi1aa	Birth control is really good these days. The odds of you conceiving while on it are very very low. If you are in a committed std free relationship you shouldn't need to use condoms. I wouldn't.|`|XGlyB56Faa	yes u should do to the fact tat the pill is only 99% active  and the condem is 80% to 99% active.
uVMlNvLoaa	I highly doubt it. Since the antibiotic killed the good bacteria, the yeasties will remain out of balance until you use Monistat, an antifungal (not another antibiotic).<br>  <br>  Remember that if you're on birth control to wait a good 7 days after you stopped taking the antibiotic until you have unprotected sex, as well. Antibiotics kill off the good bacteria in your intestines that help absorb and distribute the hormones.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|iZOC5aW0aa	you should always finish your antibiotics because if you dont then it will just come back later.|`|HHyny0JSaa	It will, but it will go much faster with an OTC treatment or another med your doc can prescribe. Just make sure not to start treating it until after you have stopped the antibiotics|`|0vQbPqbwaa	No you hve to go buy some monistat cream. Thats the only way to get rid of it.
FJpPCVTCaa	cut back on the sweets, junk food and bleached bread. you could also get more exercise, sit in a sauna or where heavy clothing to sweat them out.|`|tSi10jneaa	Apply crushed garlic and see if it works, else just forget them and they will make you forget that they ever existed.<br>  Avoid mirror as much as possible, causes stress and further adds to the misery.|`|OkBS9hhFaa	sweat......

c376c3dd25fc96e3749f0cbae92e7c6baa	A normal adult dose is 800mg. But you have to be careful not to take that very often because too much motrin is really bad for your stomach.|`|AA11693263	I remember when i pulled a back muscle years ago a friend of mine gave me three or four 200mg Motrin to take. It took the pain away in no time at all. I don't know how safe this is though. You might want to just check with a pharmacist to see if it is alright.
TMB4d3FAaa	A friend who was going through a divorce in 64 tried to hang himself. Another friend who came to visit saw him struggleing to grab something to save himself.  By the time the friend broke open  the door and cut him down the suicide victim was unconscious.   He recovered from the hanging. <br>   <br>  The psychiatrist decided he needed "Shock Treatments".  When I went to visit him they had a whole ward of "Shock Treatment" patients.  They said the treatments destroyed brain cells and made the people forget their problems.  Of course, the forgot a lot of other things too. In those days they not only had whole hospital wards for "Crazy People, the had whold compounds we called "Nut Houses" or Insane Asylums.Is ever one now cured? Where are they now?<br>  <br>  Like a lot of Medical and psuedo-medical analysis the different treatments run sickness De Jour.  What ever equipment the Doctors buy it's going to get used and paid for wether it's need or not.<br>  <br>  It wasn't used extensively on children because it was thought they weren't developed enough to be able to afford the brain cell loses.  <br>  <br>  For criminals it was used as a deterent for further crimes.  The psychiatrist would over use the treatment to the extent that quite often if the person did a new crime, he'd commit suiciede rather than get more treatments.<br>  <br>  "One flew over the Cookoos Nest" gave a little insight into the over all sadist nature of the plan.  Now all the monies have been recouped from the cost of the original machines the practice has pretty passed on to a new phase. Pills.<br>  <br>  These pillls can be given to children in abundance as well as to adults.  The same people who give them out, are the ones who do the studies and prove they don't hurt the children now or later on.  Unlike the priest who molest children and get taken to task decades later, the testers of humans under the guuise of medical treatment created a virtual safe haven for the testers.  When they tested the results of the Negroes for syphlis contamination and even injected some healthy people with the disease,  who was ever charged with a crime?
DQ1CCOazaa	Youd want to eat 5 meals a day, about every three hours, with it being high in protein. youd still have to workout or else it would be turned into fat.|`|NRfs81Raaa	Yes, as long as you leave at least 1.5 hours between the times you eat. But bodybuilders will eat protein, plus fruits and veggies, every 1.5 hours a day to get their metabolism cranking before a competition.

J2aTiqN1aa	My son is Autistic and no one knows better than a Mom. Autism is a spectrum disorder. This means every child with Autism is different. One child may be verbal another may not, one may like to cuddle and the other have issues with  people touching them.<br>  I agree you need to take your child to a DEVELOPMENTAL Pediatrician.They are different from your regular Ped. They can screen you child and lead you in the right direction. My son is high functioning Autistic. I hope you have already taken your child to your local Early Intervention office, they can also help. Your Dr. will need to do a referal in order to go but if you stress to them you want a second opinion and are concernerd about his development any good Dr. will do that for you.<br>  Also your child needs speech therapy NOW! Right now in there young years is when the brain is developing the most and what they learn or don't learn now can have an impact on the rest of there development in years to come. My son is extremely empathetic and he is Autistic. Good Luck.|`|CHiEKZrLaa	Certainly it cant hurt to have your son evaluated...<br>  <br>  But particularly given the "family history," if your son is actively engaging with you - makes good eye contact, cuddles, is putting together 2-3 word "sentences" etc.- I'm inclined to say your son is displaying perfectly normal (if very slightly developmentally delayed) behaviour.
sPQBluKEaa	no, it can't. this is a myth.|`|H2IqzG12aa	No effect whatever.  And 2-3 times a day at your age isn't uncommon.

Im 14 and i was scared but i got over it.<br>  And Now i enjoy it alot.. so yep.. just relax<3<br>  And he might ripp you(i was ripped)<br>  You really dont feel anything. at first.<br>  its after its done. you feel a lil pain....<br>  <br>  And may bleed a couple days.<br>  Use a condom Please<|`|dpgXzMenaa	For some girls, it hurts a lot... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it, you're probably not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|hzWjAiDgaa	Hon, it will hurt the first time. You have to break your hymen. It hurts!

It might be difficult finding something to be honest. Thus I can see why you posed the question as such. And I ran a search and that is how the results are given...either colleges promoting a course or private practice websites. Thus I can see where you are coming from. <br>  <br>  A good book will certainly help for illustrations, background info, the science and some typical case studies.

It is very important to get a professional assessment and diagnosis which sometimes takes more time than any of us wish it would. For years I have thought I was,and been diagnosed with clinical depression and then for a while Bipolar II. My diagnosis now is Borderline Personality Disorder and Depression and Anxiety Disorder. It all sounds worse than it is. I was also told after a extensive and thorough assessment that all mood disorders are at least partially a chemical imbalance in our brain. My husband asked if some of the symptoms or manifestations of the symptoms could be unlearned. The doctor said NO tho' talk therapy can help a lot and it has helped me. Everyone is different.<br>   I really think educating oneself about our diagnosis can really help both ourselves and our loved ones manage the illness and there are some excellent books out there to choose from. It is important to never rely solely on books and to get a doctor's help.<br>  hope this helps<br>  Mary|`|Mg4cxVy0aa	uhh...sounds like it could be a few things but individuals with PTSD can behave like you describe...and people who are Manic depressants or bipolar and don't take their meds can also behave like that...I've experienced both through people I've known.|`|r2P6PtAOaa	Manic-depression (bipolar) or Borderline Personality Disorder sound the most like that.|`|PztDZBW1aa	they could all be symptoms of depression. go to your doctor.

It may be verrry painful (as it was last time) but you know how bad it can be and it can't get any worse!

Your doctor could possibly give you some medication to help you relax. They can do it two general ways. The first is to give you some equivilant to xanex (something safe for the surgery) or they can give you something in an IV. Don't worry. You are going in there to fix something. Surgery is a good thing. It's bad when they say that they just can't fix it. Good luck|`|OtWnDh79aa	Ask then to give you laughing gas to knock you out.

AA10295001	From my own experience as being alcoholic who's been right where your mom's been I can understand why she hides her bottles.  The word is Denial.  Whether she's an alcoholic or not the only thing you can do is talk with her and then get help for yourself.  <br>  <br>  Until your mother admits her problem and decides to get help you'll ha<br>  <br>  ve to live with her drinking.  It's not about whether you looked in her space or not.  It's because you love her and you're concerned about her drinking.<br>  <br>  My daughter went through the exact same thing your going through right now.  She got help through therapy and Alateen.  This may not be possible for you to do at this point, but do talk with your school counselor or another family member so you don't feel your alone in this situation.  12 Step programs are not cult, but spiritual based.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your mother as well.|`|p42yPCJzaa	Sounds like you are sneaking about as much as she may be... Hmmm..., well stay out of the cult of aa and talk to her. A bit of honesty might do wonders for both of you.|`|jIM9CbQJaa	would really depend on the amount and if it was a daily thing.<br>  if she cant go a day without a drink that she most likely has a drink problem.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Watch her and remember that you can learn what not to do from watching people just as much as learning what to do.|`|510MC9SVaa	You could talk to her about how you feel finding the bottles. But why are your snooping in her study? Why are you sniffing her drinks? Is she being irresponsible? Is she laying out of work or leaving you to fend for yourself while she goes drinking? Is she treating you badly when you think she is drunk? Is she acting drunk around you?<br>  <br>  Just hiding bottles does not mean she is alcoholic. She may be hiding the bottles because she is trying to protect you from her drinking. She may feel that you would think differently of her if you knew she drinks occasionally.|`|oojO4WAraa	She sounds like an alcoholic.  Look up AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) and see if they have Al-a-Teen or Al-anon meetings for family members of alcoholics.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	Oh kiddo, It sure sounds like alcohol is becoming a problem.  do you have a dad or grand parent you can talk too about it? <br>  <br>  if you don't have family you can talk to about it see if you can find Alateen in your area. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/pdf/S20.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/pdf/S20.p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Contrary to lady who posted about AA as a cult, AA, Alanon and Alateen are not cults, they don't make to believe anything, or do anything. It is your choice.  As a recovering alcoholic of 23 years I can say that from personal experience, the people I've known might be able to help at very least help you to learn how to handle the emotions of watching it destroy herself. Also, honesty is a very big part about it. If you ask her about "what she is drinking" and she lies to you about it, it shows the alcohol is in control. <br>  <br>  Chemical dependency in particular the craving and mental state she is in when drinking will become worse. <br>  <br>  Ask her point blank for her to get help from someone with her drinking, do so with people who see the problem other then you. <br>  <br>  Contact a friend or family who can help you out of this situation.. <br>  <br>  You might also speak with a counselor about it. Perhaps your school has a counselor you could talk to confidentially.
f7a373eb7a994b57f8de966c9eb0968baa	I have this same problem a lot.  I went to an ENT doctor, and it is fluid in the ears, and most of the time that is a sign of an ear infection.  I didn't have any pain in my ear either, but still had an infection.  Antibiotics can take care of it.|`|Gt1aCJDeaa	before you go see the doctor do this Hold your nose(pinch it) an blow hard(but not very hard) there will be like a bubbling sound an should clear the fluids in your ear. dont worry it shouldn't damage your eardrums unless you did one massive blow then uh. . . not my fault. afterwords get a ear swab an wipe it out
tSi10jneaa	Can be a pimple or an ingrown hair. Don't do anything and just carefully observe if you see an ingrown hair else it might just be a pimple. Try applying crushed garlic over it for 3-4days and leave it overnight.
Dhz4XgQ3aa	you will have back pain, and you wont pee as much, your body will swell and you will excreet waste through your skin ie sweating so you will smell bad. You swell as there is no other way for the body to rid of fluid except through the skin so the fluid retention make you puffy.|`|el2blDi4aa	fall off|`|d499d3deedf434dfedacd65ebff057b1aa	Your urine will turn a dark color as there will be blood present in it, and there is usually lower back pain.|`|Jtt6SaVIaa	You build up toxins in your body and require dialysis. Without the dialysis, you die.|`|DT80y28Maa	you die
HoHHpwDlaa	Hey :]<br>  <br>  Try reading this :<br>  <a href="http://www.hookahpro.com/forum/showthread.php?t=9228&highlight=hookah+sickness" rel="nofollow">http://www.hookahpro.com/forum/showthrea...</a><br>  Try reading through all the posts. everyone has something new to add to it. A lot of things i didn't even know about till i read it. <br>  <br>  The reason for your headache : When smoking, you need to make sure that you're fully hydrated . Drink before and especially after you smoke. Also, make sure that you've eaten something. I always make sure that i've eaten before i smoke. <br>  <br>  and maybe, if you're using quicklights, you didn't let it heat up all the way. "Make sure they're completely red or ashed over. not black" (from link i gave you). Quicklights are choc full of chemicals and when you dont heat them up all the way, you're the road to throwing up and feeling like crap. I've heard of people fainting from that. so yeah. I just use NATURAL COALS. like Exoticas.  <br>  <br>  Also, young lady! :] <br>  you're not of age to be smoking. you're supposed to be 18. <br>  <br>  Okay, enough scolding. lol. Well, i hope i helped!|`|w5v1HlJ1aa	WTF are you stupid??? 16 year olds should NOT smoke! If you must smoke, make sure it's no more than once a day or less. Drink lots of water. Also, if you smoke, you're body is more likely to be deprived of it's vitamin C, so eat fruits and vegetables with every meal.|`|zAPJgrxKaa	Sounds like you had a seizure. It may be nothing (statistics say every person will have at least one in their lifetime), or it could be something much more serious and even life threatening (a terrible headache, blurred vision, and seizures are also signs of a tumor). I would suggest an appointment with your doctor ASAP.
L6ZEQxvLaa	Holding out may not make one into some kind of Casonova but when a young man realizes he needs sex and not jacking off as a means of sexual release, that might Prompt him to seek that female so he can have sex.<br>  <br>  Relying on masturbating as a release for sexual tension can play a part of demeaning social skills.  'well since I can jack off, what's the use of finding someone?"|`|uQe37huEaa	You won't feel so guilty every time you shake someone's hand.  That should help your social skills.  Other benefits would be improved sexual performance and bigger loads.|`|s8VZvyLQaa	if you leave masturbating for a day or two you can have the most intense orgasms ever, trust me, its so worth it lol<br>  and no it wont improve your social skills >< lol|`|4V3SJ0FQaa	You might be harder when you meet up with a woman.|`|a5rInHwjaa	u can control ur ejaculation so u last longer when having sex!|`|mThBQYGuaa	if you don't for too long, it can get oozy, mucusy and gross|`|E64juLwJaa	No it does not improve your social skills.You either have them or you don't have them.<br>  And you will have more pleasure the first time you ejaculate after  not having done anything.<br>  Colors.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	a very easy time of coming when you finally get off.|`|dm9evixvaa	it depends. when i don't masturbate i don't feel as down on myself or like i'm pathetic and need to do it to feel good. so not masturbating gives me a confidence boost and therefore could potentially enhance my social skills.<br>  if you don't do it for an extended period you can also find yourself with more energy.<br>  abstaining from masturbation can really be a positive experience.|`|SltEwVX7aa	dude, masturbation relieves horniness.  it has nothing to do with being able to play the violin (or developing your social skills).<br>  <br>  You get social skills from being social. Going on dates, hanging with friends.|`|t69pml2Aaa	I'm not aware of a link between masturbation and a lack of social skills, so I doubt very much whether a period of abstinence would be of much use.|`|LpZXuTVCaa	Why would you cut yourself off. Are you mad at your self or what.
H1YQ14Haaa	As long as you have muscle, and your tummy is niice and toned, I say stay lean. But toned.<br>  But not BULKY.<br>  But not thin...<br>  <br>  So,  a good, healthy weight with muscle, but not too much. =D|`|E64juLwJaa	Do remain lean and chiseled:is way better.<br>  Especially when you apply for a job<br>  Colors.
efdb04ba6a4a066db7fc97aeb97e9037aa	If you have someone you trust in the home as for their help.  Sit in a chair, tilt your head back, and the other person should shine a flashlight in your open mouth.  Hopefully they will be able to see the fishbone.  Get a pair of tweezers and gently remove.  This happened to my sister and me all the time when Iwe were kids.  I would not create a medical bill without trying this first.  However if you are not successful or the situation has gotten worse, then you should ask someone to drive you to the nearest urgent care facility.  Hope everything works out smoothly.|`|0xp9Oobnaa	call poison number or 911?|`|fc61a820c63d7c06677681d5406d7929aa	CALL 911.  NOW.  If you can't breathe or are having trouble moving air this is an emergency dude!
uvWH4Ioyaa	It sure sounds like schizophrenia to me based on all the people I've encountered with similar symptoms.  I've run into people whose family says they're bi-polar when I know full well that is not the case.  Maybe it's more "socially acceptable" to be bi-polar than to be schizophrenic.  And maybe the psychiatrist is more aware of your friend's problems than you know.  But labels are sometimes misleading. I believe the whole "labeling" thing has been established to allow for a short-hand description for medical professionals, pharmaceutical companies, government regulators and medical insurance companies to take a black and white world view instead of looking for shades of gray. I also believe that people who have mental illness are unique and are mentally ill in their own personal way that sometimes defies definition or labels.  Nevertheless you should encourage your friend to share her thoughts and observations with her doctor and support her to the extent you are able to.|`|3664e2604d702b7001b81d717396f845aa	Not necessarily. A lot of people don't understand what schizophrenia is. She might pretend there is a person there because feeling that someone is always with you is comforting. Like people that believe in God. If she is hallucinating and seeing the person and cats then it is a possibility although I don't know if it is possible to hallucinate so strongly that you actually see the person there and talk to them repeatedly.<br>  It's just like a child with an imaginary friend, although it's acceptable for children and a mental disorder for adults... I don't think it's anything to worry about.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	Bipolar during certain phases can exhibit psychotic breaks. including paranoid ideations.. I've worked with clients who have been rapid cycling bipolars who "get the "giggles" and talk to imaginary people (and animals).   <br>  The medical interventions for bipolar in the psychotic phase is similar to acute schizophrenic episodes. <br>  <br>  <br>  The shrink probably knows their stuff. schizophrenia generally exhibits in some cases fully lost touch with reality, rapid cyclic bipolars are much different.|`|LOfZNNdfaa	It could be schizophrenia.  It also could be Bipolar disorder, Bipolar people see things too.  I don't know if Bipolar people hear things, you should get your friend to talk to a doctor.  I myself am Bipolar and I do see things occasionally that I know no one else can see, like the devil for example, but I know its not real and it doesn't interfere with my life.  I've told my doctor about the things I see and she still says I am bipolar.|`|r3mLVJpXaa	That definitely sounds like schizophrenia. The key elements of schizophrenia are delusions and hallucinations, both of which your friend is experiencing.<br>  <br>  To Jammy: no, schizophrenia is not just when you think you're someone else. in fact, that's not what it is at all. get your facts straight and don't answer a question you know nothing about.|`|UXgoY8Afaa	Hearing voices (which includes seeing people) that other people can't hear/see, is a fairly common experience for many people that have mental health problems.  People associate it with schizophrenia but there are other 'diagnoses' that include it as a symptom.  Some people who do not have any mental health 'problems' also hear voices that others don't - it's something which causes them no distress, in fact can often cause comfort, and they do not see it as anything they want or need to change.  The fact that your friend is protective over the things she sees/hears, indicates that her voice (the 'woman') serves a purpose at this moment in her life, and she doesn't want anyone - i.e. her psychiatrist, threatening this.<br>  The best way you can help your friend is by supporting her and by simply being there for her.  Just let her be as she is rather than try and 'change' her or 'address her problems', and you'll find that by accepting her and not judging her you will be helping her immensely.  This security and confidence will help her more than you think.|`|Tk4TAsgwaa	This could still be bi.polar, im too bipolar and have hallucinations and hear things, i have been tested for schizophrenia and didnt fit into the diagnosis structure but did for bi.polar, although it does sound as though if she doesnt want help and thinks this lady is real, then this may be a sign of it, be a good friend and try and get her to go tell her key worker, just incase, i hope everything goes well :)|`|wtdic2w7aa	Symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations and delusions) can occur with many different psychiatric conditions. Most people think of them only being associated with schizophrenia, but symptoms of psychosis can also occur with bi-polar disorder and even some cases of depression. They are not a set of symptoms which indicate a singular condition.<br>  <br>  So it could well be this is a symptom of bi-polar as your friend has been diagnosed with.|`|31f512d5fa1d923173936aa0a41231deaa	im not an expert but i know bi-polar can make u delusional when you on your manic state, makng you see things. if you are concern you can talk to her psychiatrist without  her knowing, and perhaps she would know more about it, its lovely that you care,|`|KsvaAj5daa	My aunt is bipolar and she says that she knows Dolly Parton and is a famous country singer. She also is dating the singer Neil Diamond and writes poems to Opera, Hulk Hogan, and calls Barrack Obama on a nightly basis.|`|7BuPtMSMaa	wow. thats so sad. theres this lady that goes to my church that says there is russian spies that keep asking her to make dinner for them or they'll hold her hostage,  idk what she has, but it sounds similar|`|AzBdNTc5aa	it sounds like it, but im not positive i'm only in highschool but we discussed mental illnesses and schizophrenia was one of them. it could be schizophrenia or a hallucination if shes on medicine for bipolar|`|VLRZT9Foaa	Maybe she is a medium.. and she's driving herself nuts trying to let doctors tell her she has a mental problem.<br>  <br>  How do you know she can't see her?
KJmuHxcCaa	twice a day moring and night|`|rSIF5jtSaa	Once in the morning and once at night.|`|a1KqdXLXaa	Ideally every time after you eat.  However, at least twice a day.  In the morning (after you eat), and last thing before bed.  At the end of the day is the most important time to brush in order to remove all food particles from your teeth so that bacterial acids cannot cause tooth decay while you sleep.|`|ttIsK3j3aa	well ideally after every meal but that usually isnt practical during lunchtime...so twice a day really.  (you could try mouthwash during the day)<br>  <br>  About 2 hours after cleaning plaque begins to form on the teeth and although it takes 48hrs to fully mature its best to get rid of it asap really.<br>  <br>  Oh and try to floss...I know its a pain in the *** but its really got to be done|`|QFEv8xSnaa	your supose 2 after everymeal but what i do is in th morning and before i go to bed is fine :) oh and floss once in a while|`|2H4OVVHTaa	At least two times a day and make sure you floss before you brush your teeth.|`|A0o8soNeaa	twice a day is fine, just make sure you floss!|`|c8f8978bfae705ec30c276472d60b840aa	one day of the week.<br>  <br>  ;) Duhhh
paerqxfMaa	You can't.  Maybe on-line from Mexico or Canada.|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Call the embassy, they may have the answer,. Or go to the Dr. in the U.S and say you left your meds at home and tell them what you need.<br>       Good Luck|`|7ab916140739d43fdaf1975e036f6b98aa	Advair is prescription only.  Your sister will need to go to an American physician and get a prescription.<br>  Advair is very, very expensive.  The cost for a one month's supply, without insurance, is about $200.|`|el2blDi4aa	noooooo
ToILKl6waa	Relax and realize you can get caught up just as quickly as you missed school. Take one issue at a time and devote extra time from your schedule to getting any work or lessons you missed. Try to focus on your studies and push all other problems aside. Do not let stress get the worst of you. As long as you take a deep breath and stop yourself from missing anymore school, you'll be on the right track.|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Try using this to get ideas how to cope: <a href="http://stress-help-guide.com/student-stress-makes-school-life-challenging/" rel="nofollow">http://stress-help-guide.com/student-str...</a>|`|fLxTlM9paa	First of all, there's no reason you should be in the dark about your grade. Just go up to your teachers, and say "Could you please tell me what my grade in this class is?" Once you know, you'll be better able to tell where you are. I don't know what you consider acceptable, but wherever you want to end up, the best way to get there is to make a plan. Plot out how much work you're going to do each night, and just follow the chart. You'll be fine, and having a specific plan should help you feel more comfortable where you are.|`|1h7lAJ8Daa	Hey Yankee D!<br>  <br>  Flu is just the worst and at the same time as marking- thats just plain bad luck! I really do feel for you!<br>  <br>  What you could do is speak to your parents who might be able to speak to your teachers for you- or if you can't do that speak to your teachers yourself. <br>  <br>  Also, please don't worry yourself! I myself have school exams and am very stressed at the moment- but i'm telling my worries to go away and making sure i take time to chill out- because without relaxation your brain just can't work!<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could ask a friend to lone you their work?<br>  <br>  Best wishes and Good Luck! xxxxxxx|`|IFS5LPHtaa	try relieing that stress, exercise or listen to music, go out somewhere.|`|uBXNMiVeaa	Just believe in yourself and your faith will pull you through.|`|udQ5P8mYaa	You can always stay after class and ask your teachers. They may not be able to give you the grade for the class... but they will be able to tell you if you are on the right track and if you're caught up.
Z0GfGZtJaa	I would guess hormones. I have a few ideas that helped me in similar situation.  Drink plenty of water. VERY IMPORTANT....put deodorant on at night. clean yourself then reapply with a different brand. Carry alcohol pads with you and wipe underarms often,   this helps close pours.<br>     Good Luck|`|geJM58L2aa	It's because of your glands.  A girl I went to high school with had to use prescription deoderant because she had the same problem.  What kind of deoderant do you use?  Try the clinical strength kinds.  If that doesn't way, you may want to see your doctor to find out what options you have since you're self consious about it.|`|9V07srI9aa	I have the same problem and I went to the doctor and got presciption deoderant but the clinical strength works really well make sure you put it on at night like the directions say|`|IkAtIQumaa	Hormonal change perhaps???|`|fvaR7uVfaa	check your thyroid gland
GvEsaVYeaa	If your voice has broken, you may or may not know. If it has, and you can't tell, ask someone that you have known for a while, like a parent, a sibling, or a friend. Just expect it to change again before you hit the end of puberty.|`|tVfkiFAvaa	I didn't really notice it happening at the time but afterwards it was obvious|`|FsEK3Ueeaa	it starts getting deeper......|`|PAvYZJK2aa	high pitch and low suddenly|`|E64juLwJaa	Tape your own voice and then listen to it:it will sound lower then you thought<br>  Colors.
