20090309182114AAziOnT	Environment;Global Warming	Why is Al Gore afraid to confront Czech President Vaclav Klaus?	As he has done numerous times before, Al Gore cowardly ducked out of a global warming conference (this one in Santa Barbara, CA) because he doesn't want to face Vaclav Klaus, who does not believe in the theory of man-made global warming.      Is Gore's cowardice just typical of limousine liberals everywhere, or is Gore's ability to defend his position just too weak?

I have been eating organic for a few years, and have been concerned with the earth and global warming many more. However, I am seeing bags and shirts, which are made very commercially in china and other countries, that say GO GREEN, and SAVE THE PLANET.       Is this the way to discredit truly being green into some fad?       I will not buy these items, because I don't need a shirt made in a sweatshop to show how much respect I have for our planet.
