20090205161027AAd4oTt	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	What is the maximum you can claim for out of pocket medical expenses on your tax return?	Our family spent about $14,000+ from out of pocket for medical expenses (prescriptions, oral braces each for twin sons and emergency medical treatment and durable medical equipment for one son breaking his foot).  Can we claim the entire amount on our 1040 form for 2008 taxes towards a refund, or does the US Government place a cap on medical expenses?  Thanks for your time!
20090205160422AAoRS8X	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Should I hire my best friend as my assistant at work?	My company is in the process of reorganizing and, as the supervisor of my department, I have the opportunity to hire a new assistant.  The first person that comes to mind is my best friend of 8 years, who is presently running out her finals days with her current employer.  She has a lot of the office skills necessary and I'm very confidant in her ability to excel.  My only concern would be putting my neck out on the line.  The VP of my company said that if I hire someone I know, make sure that I'm as comfortable with firing them as I am hiring them.  I doubt I'd ever have to fire her (she's really a good worker) but it's something I'd be willing to do; albeit something that could kill our friendship if it ever came down to it.  What do you think -- should I hire my best friend as my assistant?

20080329193610AAdYp4F	Business & Finance;Small Business	I want to bring in some extra cash with a hobby.  How could I advertise?	Next year I will be going into college (community to start with) and working.  I figured since I will probably be living with my mom that I should not only support my own pets and self but help pay some bills.  I had the idea of making dog coats (warm for those with short hair or thin coats) and selling them.  Then I though why stop there?  Why not make beds too?  So this summer I plan on practicing on my own dog who has a very thin coat and freezes in the winter.  This summer I planned on making a few beds for practice and sell them at a discounted price (the price it cost to make it).  I also thought about making small cat trees and beds.      Is this a good idea?  If so, how could I advertise?

It cant be to keep ppl from selling faulty products bc customers can just as easily sell faulty avon on ebay and the company doesn't go after them just reps.   It cant be about cutting down on competition against other reps bc as a rep im already in competition with other reps in my state or area.

Well basically Im giving written 30 day notice to my landlord tommorow. This is a month to month contract. Rather than giving my 30 notice to leave on March 1st, I forgot, and I am giving it tommorow. I still plan to leave on March 31st allthough from what I understand I gave him the 30 day notice, 7 days late so regardless of if I leave on March 31st, I belive he can charge me for 7 extra days from my deposit. I think we can work out a deal because it is probably in his best intrest to have me out by the 31st as well so he can find a prospective tenant to move in starting April 1st. He will probably agree to let me leave and return my full deposit, but I need help on writing this agreement. Should I add the 30day notice and agreement on one page together and ask him to sign it? or should the agreement and 30 day notice be on seperate pages? do I state the conditions and write (I landlord agree) state conditions and have him sign it?? Do I write the contract in first or third person?

20090205123922AAiONX1	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Had good credit and then #$%^% a disaster!!!?	I had a credit score of 740. I have an AUTO Loan through a credit union. I called them last August @ Member Connect Customer Service and spoke with a lady who assured me I could pay late and she would make a note about it. I had NEVER been late before. Well. I did and somehow the payment has been a month behind even though I have continued to make payments for my regular scheduled time and I though I was paying on time. Apparently I needed to make 2 payments to get caught up. I just found this out a few weeks back because I was going to refinance my house. Suprise!! The Credit Union had been reporting me month after month- 1 month late. My credit score was a 620! That low in a matter of a few months. I never recieved a late notice or anything. I pay the loan online through a transferr and never realised what was going on! Today I made 2 payments to get caught up. How long before my credit score goes back up? Will it go up as quickly as it was lowered??? Thanks!!!

20090205104051AAT8LjE	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	IRS delay 1121 2008 tax year?	OK after looking at all the yahoo answers from last year I found several helpful sites and once you find out what TC gave you the delay code you can read them.  Bare in mind that tracing the maze of TC codes can give you a migraine.  Reference 8002 is a bs code that they put up when the computer spits out a batch of returns.  1121 is a code that translates to because of computer spitting it out, a person has to go in and tell computer to do it, if not they have to enter it just like a paper return.  If that happens either you will get a notice saying about when to get your paper check or you will get a DD in about a month.  The only people who have to worry about delay codes are the people who got the code because of TC codes like 844-845.  That will result in a possible audit or big delay in your refund.         The 1st site is from IRS and they omitted several pages of stuff they don't want us to see       http://books.google.com/books?id=6hGBJBo...       The 2nd site is just from searching nonstop for an explanation.        http://www.nstp.org/doc/Non-MasterFile%2...       Like I said go to IRS site and search for your delay reference number, that will give you TC codes, then go the the 2 sites I posted to find out what caused the delay.         Hope this helps someone.

And for some reason, it's seen as a "safe" currency in times like this.  But if you look at the fundamentals, Japan is in big trouble.

Is it too early yet to short?  What do you think?

I currently work for a NY based IT consulting company and I'm placed at a client in NJ. I've worked here for almost 3 years and I only get my normal hourly wage for hours worked over 40. Unlike others that work for my consulting company, I'm actually an employee with them not a 10-99, I have my W-2.

20090205134829AAedZ0x	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Is it better to pay off total amount of credit card debt, or settle?	I have a large amount of revolving debt.  I'm current on my payments, but I have little left over to live on every month.        I'm expecting a big tax return.  It won't be enough to pay off all of my debt.  BUT, if I stop making payments for 2-3 months, save the amount I would have paid, and add it to my refund, I should have enough to settle with the companies and eliminate all of my debt (assuming they'll negotiate with me on a final amount).        I realize that I'll have to stop paying and threaten to declare bankruptcy before they'll negotiate with me, and that it will harm my credit.  I would probably be able to pay off my debt eventually, but it might take me 5-10 years, maybe longer.  I feel like things I want to do will have to be postponed because of it.      Also, I'm still in college and not planning on buying a home or applying for a car loan or anything for a few more years.      Would it be better to take the hit on my credit rating and get rid of my debt now by negotiating?  Or should I tough it out, keep my credit intact, and pay the full amount (which will be thousands more with interest by the time I get it all paid off).       Thanks :-)

I'm a graduate, with a first class honours degree in Mathematics from a Russell Group university.   I graduated last summer, and since then have been working in an office just to sustain myself why I think of what I want to do, and several months later it has suddenly hit me that I am no closer to knowing what I want to do.      I don't want to go into teaching or the financial sector. These are the two sectors people first think of when I tell them I am a Mathematics graduate.      It's really starting to get my down as I have no clue what I want to do, ie. not even the slightest idea what I'd even like to try.      People may say, I'm young (22), and hence have all the time in the world to decide, but I don't want to float around aimlessly, I'd like to have an idea of what I'm aiming for, and what I could be doing in the mean time to improve my credentials.      The only idea I have is I'd like to go into management, but I have no specific sector that I would like to go into (other than not finance or teaching), so when looking for jobs (with limited experience in anything other than temporary admin), it's difficult to really know what I'd like to do, let alone have any of the skills needed.      So please, could someone help, give me an idea of what I'd like to do. I've called the government advice line, and tried to go through all of their advice, but it seems to hinge on knowing what I want to do. Which I do not, and never really have!      Can you help?      Thanks.

Please help me I am sure people will think I have been very irresponsible but I have been running away from various debts for years.   I was married and left my husband and ran away from debts. I never told anyone where I was going and left the area.   When I moved into my new house I ran up a joint debt with my new partner and several other debts in my own name. Again I ran away, I wanted to tackle my problems but it was a very violent relationship and despite the fact the house was a housing association house in my name he refused to leave and I couldnt take the torment any longer so again  ran away. He doesnt know where I am and has made no attempt to contact me he did however say that he would pay off the debts as he got to keep the house. Do I trust that he did that well Im not sure!   When I moved into my new place I was really good - no debt   Now I have moved in with my boyfriend who I am so happy with and he is definately solvent and pays everything on time    He knows nothing about my shameful past and there is NO WAY I can tell him for fear of ruining our relationship!   The other day I received a letter from a collections agancy stating that they had bought my xxxxxxx credit card debt, I contacted a debt management company in panic and they advised that ALL my creditors will eventually catch up with me so I have no choice but to get my credit file and they will negotiate with all the creditors and I will just have to pay them back.   I got my credit report and it shows accounts being managed well all 0 rates (which means no payments missed) but these are for curent things at my new address such as my mobile   Then comes the horrific bit on my credit file it shows 52 records for linked addresses (most are duplicated but pretty much everywhere I have lived is on there)   I didnt put any other addresses to get my credit report apart from my current one and the one I lived in for a short period of time and ran up no debt      I called the debt collection company and said I had never had an xxxxxxxxx card they asked me if i had lived at a particular address which I might add I never did live it as it is where my ex husband moved to after we split up and the woman said okay no worries we must have the wrong person and we will send you a letter of apology?      I just dont know what to do..............      Shall I go with the debt management company and add my old (bad debt addresses) to my experian credit file?      Shall I just carry on the way I am and going as I have heard that most debts are written off under statute after 6 years which is only 12 months away      I cant got to CAB as I know thy will only tell me to contact then creditors and arrange to pay - I dont want to do that as I dont want my partner to find out and I am sure he will if I start unearthing all this past       Please someone help me I am going insane!

I'm reapplying for the local community health plan and they want prove that either I filed taxes or didn't.      I called the IRS number they gave me and the person said they won't give me it. I have to fill out a form and call somewhere in California yet they hung up before I could ask anymore questions.      Also another question. I attempted to file taxes for 2007 when I was working but I am pretty much new at all this stuff and my sister did it for me online. I'm completely stupid when it comes to this.      She got one number of my social wrong and that is why they are saying I didn't file. This is very frustrating and I don't know what to do.      According the the community health plan I am reapplying for, for health benefits, if they don't get the documents by the 26th of this month i will be disqualified for one year.      All this would not have happened if my sister hadn't gotten that one number wrong in my social.

20090205162314AASeIEw	Business & Finance;Credit	If a debt collector purchases a credit card debt from CC company do I have to pay the Debt collector?	A lawyer is contacting me on behalf of a third party debt collector, which claims to have purchased debt on a credit card that was supposedly opened by me years ago. I have asked the lawyer and the debt collector to provide me with an original contract from the credit card company or even a credit card statement that shows that I do own the debt. They refuse and only send me a simple piece of paper listing an account number, my name and an amount.       Is it wrong to expect a copy of an original statement or the original contract? Is it my right to refuse to work with either the law firm or the third party debt collector? Otherwise, how do I know for sure that the debt is truly mine and that I'm not being scammed?
