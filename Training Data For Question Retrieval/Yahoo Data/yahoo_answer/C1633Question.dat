20090307183033AA4TDuo	Travel;United States;Orlando	Has anybody ever been to Orlando Magic official store in Orlando?	Next weekend, i am going to make a first trip to watch Orlando Magic game.      Recently, I found the source from Magic website that their store is located in Florida Mall, not in Amway Arena.   But, normally, official team stores are located at teams' arena.      So, I just wonder that "Where is Orlando Magic official store".   "Is there any Magic official store at Amway Arena".      I don't have plenty of time in Orlando, so I have to manage my schedule precisely before watching the game.   Would you please help me answering my doubt.      Thank you

20090307183423AAERsXT	Travel;Air Travel	Has anyone brought anything illegal overseas on a plane and get or not get in trouble for it?	I was just wondering if anyone has ever brought a contraband overseas to another country on a plane and has or hasn't got in trouble for it. My friend says hes going to the Philippines this May and he keeps asking me if its doable. I told him that he shouldn't do it because its against the law and he would get in huge trouble for doing it if he gets caught. But he insists i ask around and hear other people's experience. I think its a pretty stupid idea but hey, its just a question. Also, he wants to know if prescription medicine or bottles of like supplements and vitamins are allowed on the plane. I don't want to see a good friend going to jail for something preventable. Im hoping to get more "failed" answers so i can share it with him and hopefully discourage him from doing it. What hes trying to bring over there is MJ, in case anyone didn't have an idea.  Please, share your experiences. Good or bad. Succeed or fail. Please answer this question in a mature manner.       Sincerely,   Chris
20090307183718AAHuLnh	Travel;United States;Phoenix	Are there any similarities between Boca Raton, FL and Scottsdale, AZ?	I'm living in Boca Raton. FL currently, and although the weather is beautiful, there's SO many seniors down here and they're all from the New York suburbs. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I'm a midwestern girl myself and I'm looking for a place, that has more of a midwest or western vibe (California is too far away) with warm weather and lots of shopping.  I know that there's quite a large degree of seniors in Scottsdale, but I can't imagine it being as many as Boca Raton, FL.  Can anyone give me any information?  Thanks.
