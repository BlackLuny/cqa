20090309200854AApwPtk	News & Events;Current Events	Is Anyone Else Tired of This Anti-Smoking Campaign?	The way I see it, people know it kills you. It says so on the box. It's full of chemicals and can give you cancer, which we all learn from a fairly young age now a days. But I'm kind of getting tired of the anti-smoking commercials on the TV, in which the tobacco company is presented as being run by Satan and has a mission of killing the maximum amount of people they possibly can. They're doing the same thing every other company sets out to to: make a product, sell it, make a profit. I don't see this sort of effort going into anti-alcohol campaigns, or anti-gun campaigns. And there sure as hell ain't no campaign against cars despite how many people get killed in auto accidents(often because of alcohol). Now I'm not investing in cigarettes anytime soon but does anyone else find being anti-cigarettes kind of a moot point? And for the record, I don't smoke, nor do I have any plans to take up the habit.

Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda dont give a hoot who we elected, they still want to destroy America.

What i am getting at is that Joe Biden was right when he said Obama (actually WE all as a country) will be tested within the first 6 months.    This isnt a insult towards Obama, this is just a sad fact. He cant and wont say it but im certain he knows it too. What im getting at is dont let your guard down simply because you think we are safe now.
