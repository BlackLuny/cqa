3iL7V04waa	I'm a senior in high school right now and I just received a full Army ROTC scholarship.  What I'm doing is called SMP (simultaneous membership program), basically I'm enlisted and will be a cadet at the same time.<br>  You need to keep your grades AT LEAST above a 3.3, however if you're pulling a 4.0 right now, it sounds like you're on the right track academically.  Don't neglect extra curricular activities.  These are vital to earning a scholarship.  If you haven't played a sport this year, join up next year and try to get a leadership position.  The biggest thing you can do is hold leadership positions and get involved in things you're interested in.  If you excel in a certain subject area, try to find out if there are any standardized tests you can take to rank well and put that on your application.  <br>  Stay out of trouble and drugs.  This sounds clich√©, but it's incredibly important to avoid drugs and alcohol, staying out of trouble with the law, etc.<br>  If you can, get a job when you're old enough.  This will show them that you are responsible and serious.<br>  Stay in shape and make sure that you work yourself up to meet the minimum APFT standards by the time you apply.  While this is not required, it will show them that you will be able to pull your weight.<br>  Just to give you an example of what someone else did to earn a scholarship, here's me:<br>  17 y/o enlisted female<br>  3.75 GPA, rigorous course load, captain of 2 teams, MVP of 1 team, officer of a school club, met minimum APFT standards, within weight limit, have a part time job, volunteer experience, won standardized test awards for foreign languages, etc.<br>  You see what I mean?  It's not all about your grades, but also your person.  The interview you'll eventually do it also vital.  If you can prove yourself to have a good head on your shoulders, they'll put in a good word for you.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  ADD:  No, SMP is not a scholarship, but I received an ROTC scholarship, and that money trumps the tuition assistance I got in my contract.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	It is more difficult to receive a scholarship in the Scholarship Program than in the College Program. The more selective universities often have College Program scholarships for any Cadet who wants one. <br>  Keep up the GPA. Pay attention to Algebra, Algebra2 and Geometry as these are tested on the SAT1. Along with reading comprehension and writing. Show leadership in extracurriculars and do a certain amount of community service and you shall be fine:<br>  Great advice for any service academy, rotc scholarship or to gain admission to any selective university.<br>  <a href="http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/preparation/" rel="nofollow">http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.academyadmissions.com/assets/images/tertiary/ter_academicprep_off.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.academyadmissions.com/assets/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.academyadmissions.com/assets/images/tertiary/ter_physicalprep_off.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.academyadmissions.com/assets/...</a><br>  Army Corps of Engineers is overwhelmingly staffed by  civilian employees.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Stat...</a>|`|Jf8T1WHKaa	From what I've heard getting the 4 year scholarship is not that hard as long as you meet the requirements. If you have good grades, do a sport, a club, and some community service then you should have no problem. You have plenty of time to do all these things, your still a freshman. Just keep thinking about it, researching it, emailing and talking to ROTC people to build up your knowledge about it. Thats what I've been doing and it has really helped me a lot. Good luck to you and your application.  :)|`|1zfKVG5Xaa	colleges.mywebcommunity.org - try this site. It has info about different US scholarships for college students and their grades requirements.|`|Q8GFvklUaa	SMP is not a scholarship.<br>  <br>  Anyways, most people I know that didn't get a 4 year scholarship was because they could not pass the APFT or lost it because they failed an APFT. If you have a 4.0 and meet all the requirements. It's not like everyone is rushing to get an ROTC scholarship, so they are not that hard to get if you meet the requirements. <br>  <br>  In your Junior/MS-3 year you list the branches (what the army calls officer MOS's) you want in order. So you put 1. Engineers 2. Military Intelligence 3. Field Artillery and so on. You are then evaluated based on your GPA, Your PT scores, How you did at LDAC and so on. Each evaluation is worth points. They total the points and rank all the cadets in the Nation.<br>  <br>  So if you rank 27th in the Nation and you have Engineer as your first choice chances are you will get it. Unless the Army only needs 20 Engineers and 20 people ahead of you selected Engineer first.<br>  <br>  That's basically how it works, you can agree to add time to your service (6 years instead of 4) in exchange for more points or graduate school. <br>  <br>  I got my first pick Infantry/Military Intelligence Branch Detail, by agreeing to serve more time.<br>  <br>  ADD: Thanks to the High School Senior telling the 6 year active duty veteran and ROTC MS VI how things work. You know so much about something you haven't done yet.
3e46aef76b1fb84d0ce11d48fc610f4faa	Absolutely. In fact my kid sister is one of them. Whenever I would discuss the utter phoniness of both he and his party during the whole thing, her response was that John McCain was more of a terrorist than anyone obama ever associated with. Why? He is in the same party as  George Bush. One professor at the school that I finished my M.A. at is also a flamming communist whose class consisted of praising the Clintons until Obama became the "in candidate." The U.S. has been in bad shape ever since the liberals took hollywood and university system. Yes, they are annoying and while barry o isn't nearly as annoying as they, he has the potential to turn the country socialst and one way or the other, we must vote conservative in the congressional elections of 2010.|`|94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	I'm actually starting to feel kinda sorry for the guy.

I can't speak for anyone else but I come here to blast a few people I disagree with but if we were sitting in a bar having the same discussion then I would use different language.  The only people that come here to get real information are high school students looking for help with their homework and they never come back after posting one question.  Most of us don't hate each other as much as it might seem.  I don't know any of these people and if I did I'm sure i'd find a reason to like most of the people here.  You have to take this place with a grain of salt.  Some of it might be real but none of it matters.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	watch out for the Libs they throw mud like nobody's business, the conservatives are usually pretty direct. Easy to ignore.

J74Y5LKxaa	FACT:  stocks dropped over 400 points upon learning that Obama won the eleciton. <br>  <br>  FACT:  stocks have fallen another 1400 points since<br>  <br>  FACT:  despite a $787 BILLION pork bill, stocks have continued to fall to six year lows that rival the levels following the 911 attacks when the stock market actually shut down for a week.  <br>  <br>  CONCLUSION:  Apparently investors don't share the voters optimism about Obama and his complete and total lack of economic experience.  Stocks are now at 7400'ish despite being over 14,000 just 2 years ago before we elected democrats back into the House and the Senate.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	Yep. Its what they want. They are devaluing America so the NORTH AMERICAN UNION can take effect in the near future and they want to pass it off as a good thing that will solve all of north America's problems. Later on they want the one world government. So the rich stay in power and us "Joe blows" stay as the good little worker bee's that we are. Never getting the opportunity to get rich and power full like them. We are heading for it and I will be the first to take up arms against the government and lead the free people of America to war. Good luck and never trust the government.|`|fUh7LHzvaa	Earth to LA LA LAND, the stock market rise during the last 20 years was due to bubbles in the finance industry, including real estate.

If you think the stock market is dropping because a Democrat got elected, then you haven't paid attention to the 8 years Bill Clinton was in power...some of our best economic times in history.|`|2FsiTlb5aa	Democrats hate Capitalism and do not believe in the Stocks Market.<br>  <br>  That is why.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	They bet on a long shot, and that horse is a canner.|`|AA12045802	You betcha.|`|1f6543187bec0a2b82a046b6a594e920aa	Who cares?

It does not provide that some private employer cannot restrict speech as a condition of employment.|`|VjgqZetcaa	Yes, perhaps, because airlines are acting as agents of the government while carrying out security aboard airlines.<br>  <br>  In the same vein, if you work for an airline and violate the civil rights of a customer, you could be sued under 42 USC 1983, if you are acting as an agent of the federal government (i.e., providing on-board security).|`|OaOFdvCnaa	nope, same reason you can not say bomb at an airport, it puts people in the risk of danger

And the markets are reflecting that. Trillions of dollars have evaporated from peoples retirement accounts, mutual funds, and more. This is a tax on our economy as a whole. And now the same lamebrains that have botched the running of the Postal Service, the failure of medicare, medicaid and social security want to run the nations banks. <br>  <br>  Until someone puts some smelling saltz under Nobama's nose (instead of coke) the markets will not recover and neither will the rest of the economy. The markets have ALWAYS recovered before the general economy in past recessions and even the Great Depression.<br>  <br>  Nobama and his minions are only making things worse.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	I'm pretty sure, slick, that it was caused by the economic bullshit Bush did (along with Republicans like deregulation).  Obama just inherited it.|`|UUDCaFpXaa	The market knows that massive spending destroys an economy.|`|e2e2ccd6c15e732cbfc8b82485ecb4ebaa	The country has lost faith in obama.|`|ZxtEh7yZaa	Because the guys that handle the money and provide jobs don't trust OBOZO!
IJTcGIG7aa	Russia was never Communist to begin with.<br>  <br>  They called themselves Communist, but weren't.<br>  <br>  Karl Marx (the guy who defined Communism, but never once used the term) was thinking of the most advanced industrial nations when it came to 'breaking the last dialectic....like the USA.   He figured the leading class would eventually get TOO greedy, and the last battle (the last dialectic) would fall....and the PEOPLE would regain control of the 'means of production' (all the factories, etc).<br>  <br>  You could argue, if we continue the downward slide in the economy, that we will become much like Marx described.   We'll move to a Socialist model, and in an ideal world, prosper and enjoy all the fruits our country can provide.   It won't be only a select few who enjoy it.<br>  <br>  Russia was barely industrialized in 1917.   Its government went under the name 'Communist' but wasn't ran by the people (a Democracy)....it was ran by single party rule.   A dictatorship....and a very harsh one that wasn't friendly to the people at all.    This wasn't what Marx described.<br>  <br>  Oh....but put that 'Reagan beat Communism by spending our country into massive amounts of debt - STARVE THE BEAST!'.    That's probably what your teacher is looking for.|`|AA12365543	Soviet Union was in serious debt. They had too many social programs but no money to fund them, plus a huge military that had no funds.|`|vYgJMybeaa	The Soviet Union was not a communist country ever.

So if he shoots someone, even in anger, he didn't fully understand the consequences of doing so because he doesn't understand death and its permanence.<br>  <br>  Therefore, he cannot establish a criminal intent, because he doesn't understand his situation.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Now whether that is true or not, I don't know.  But on a legal basis, that is why they aren't always charged as strongly as someone who may be older.  Someone older who understands what death is, and how permanent it is.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I don't think a six year old has a concept of death.

28yMpUfSaa	Pure communism may seem more like an ethical system than an economic system. Basically, it is extremely suspicious of private claims to anything beyond one's personal possessions, projects, privacy, etc. Many anarcho-communists expect people to set up community workshops where people can produce as they see fit, and community storehouses, where they can leave what they make and take what they need. It would eliminate transaction costs.<br>  <br>  Anarchism supports free association, opposes the state, and opposes hierarchy. (At the very least, anarchists oppose involuntary hierarchy; anarchists often try to create egalitarian alternatives to the semi-voluntary hierarchies too). There are several different traditions which respect these values, and usually recognize each other as forms of anarchism. These traditions borrow ideas from classical liberalism, from early socialism, from each other, and sometimes from other sources.<br>  <br>  Skinheads are people in one punk subculture. It's more macho and hardcore than most other punk subcultures. Nazis have tried to infiltrate the skinhead scene. Many if not most skinheads are anti-racist and anti-fascist and consider the Nazis "boneheads."|`|WXLwYANPaa	Answer - Obama, radical left-wing party and some bald guys.|`|IfGZYSyAaa	A communist is someone who believes in a fair equal society with a government  controlled economy.

It is good to have a broad spectrum of viewpoints.  Economists, after all, helped mightily to get us into this economic mess--for example, did we not deify Alan Greenspan?  Indeed, on this or most other issues I would rather have rational, intelligent, knowledgeable people from various fields and with common sense.<br>  <br>     Have you not heard the old saying (which, by the way, certainly holds a lot of truth):   If you took all the economists in the world and laid them end to end, they would point in all directions.|`|y4Nc0W4Kaa	It is sad that the media is so enamored of this straw man that they choose to ignore substance in favor of fluff|`|wzwUcjvhaa	Don't and never well read nor pay any attention to any news on Yahoo|`|J03Qy5aoaa	6%, that's about how much good its going to do for us....|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Yes.  But I don't think the media ever did.  They are trying to make money, just like every other company in America.  The media makes money by selling ad time, and they can sell at higher rates if they have more viewers.  Therefore, the intent of most media companies isn't to inform the American public as much as it is to engross the American public.  Having uninformed people rant and rave about the stimulus is much more interesting than an actual breakdown of what's covered in the stimulus.  Americans would rather be entertained than informed.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Yes

Seems if the "people" are fighting then they are more worried about their piece of the pie and the people at the top (let's call them the bottom feeders) can get away with just about anything.  under Clinton I saw an increase of robbing the country, then it accelerated under Bush and now it looks like it will continue under Obama.<br>  <br>  It's sad, but now they and i have to throw in the Congress people as they are just as complicit as the others have allowed the financial people to spread bad debt all around the world and ruin them also and our semi good name.  It has also just about broken the back of the meat of America the middle class.<br>  <br>  So by making people argue they can do what they want and say anyone bringing up a point of robbing or something the "other sides".  All these crooks were brought to the attention of the fEDS and they did nothing.  Have a great 2009!<br>  <br>  By the way it's hard to blame them since their are about 35,000 lobbyist and they gave them $4.2 billion last year and the lobbyist also employ their children and other family members and the congress people in turn can also employ other family members such as a husband or wife to manage the money they are given for re-election.   like our former Senator Trent Lott, his son is one and now he is one. Go figure.|`|Uk4OwRtMaa	It's not that the major political parties seek to polarize the country. It's just that there are (at least) 2 diametrically opposed points of view on what's the best way to handle the governments business.<br>  <br>  Liberals lean towards the "equal outcome" legislation.<br>  Conservatives lean towards the "equal opportunity" legislation.<br>  <br>  These mix like water and oil.|`|rFoKf7ieaa	Of course they realize it does nothing to help Americans.

It's just the effect of their actions. Political parties seek to promote their ideas to get things done in Washington DC. There are many politically corrupt people in DC, but a lot of them are there to help the citizens. Also, the media plays a huge role in the singular view of negative partisan politics. It's just like how the media portrays "pork-barrel spending". Pork-barrel spending is not always a bad thing. These sneaky ways of finding funding for constituents is an important function of our government. Something like funding for a post office might be important to one city, and then seen as "wasteful" spending to others. Anyway... What I am getting at is that parties are good to keep our government balanced. If the parties did not exist, there would be more of a chance of tyranny by the party.

A church is able to express its beliefs in any political matter with the exception of backing a specific political candidate, which is the same right of any other nonprofit organization. So do you want the tax exempt status taken away from the all other 501 agencies out there that provide a much needed service in your communities and push all social assistance to an inefficient government?|`|cMHxg372aa	Yes, and irregardless of their politics or participation therein. They are a straight-up BUSINESS, or more precisely, a RACKET, and they should be TAXED LIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS.

It is, in effect, a state subsidy to religion.<br>  <br>  Now, if they are actually providing services to a community, they can write those off. But THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON THEIR BOTTOM LINE, just like any other business.|`|dMeVhu0iaa	My Baptist church became a nest of repubs that literally took over the pulpit over G.

Everyone knows a house divided against itself will not stand,so yes,the more division and slander they cause the more they think they can infiltrate and finagle their way back to the Presidency and control using the chaos as a smoke screen to attempt to regain that power and keep people blind.The people aren't really dividing I think they are coming together and the neo cons and their compatiots are slowly but surely being weeded out and seen for what they are.There may be some division for awhile but it won't stand,the ignorant will wake to reality,but the metamorphosis will take time.

The Federal Reserve collects interest on money it simply creates out of thin air.  All money that is in existence today was at one time lent out by the Federal Reserve, if all debts were repaid no money would exists. <br>  <br>  It is time to end the monopoly of the Federal Reserve Monopoly. Here are the top 3 reason to abolish the Fed:<br>  <br>  1. It is incapable of achieving its stated objectives: <br>  <br>   The Federal Reserve System was supposedly created to stabilize our economy. Since its inception, it has presided over the crashes of 1921 and 1929; the Great Depression of 1929-1939; recessions in 1953, 1957, 1969, 1975, and 1981, a stock market ‚ÄúBlack Monday‚Äù in 1987; our current banking crisis; over 1000% inflation and 98% loss of the dollar‚Äôs purchasing power. That incredible loss was transferred to the Federal Government in the form of hidden taxation. The Federal Reserve is the mechanism that has made this possible. After repeated changes in personnel, after operating under both political parties, after experiments in monetary policy, after dozens of revisions to its charter, there has been more than enough time to work out the flaws of the system. The fact is that the Fed‚Äôs stated objectives were not its true objectives. Its true objectives were to stop the growing influence of small rival banks, make the money supply more elastic (more plentiful), pool the reserves of the nation‚Äôs banks into one large reserve so all banks will be motivated to follow the same loan-to-deposit ratios, and to shift the losses from the owners of the banks to the taxpayers. <br>  <br>  2. It is a cartel operating against the public interest: <br>  <br>   A cartel is a group of independent businesses which join together to coordinate the production, pricing, or marketing of their members. Like a monopoly, the goal of a cartel is to reduce competition and increase profitability. In 1910, seven men who represented ? of the world‚Äôs wealth got together to write a banking bill in a highly secretive fashion at Jekyll Island.  In the February 9, 1935, issue of the Saturday Evening Post, an article appeared written by Frank Vanderlip. In it he said: ‚ÄúDespite my views about the value to society of greater publicity for the affairs of corporations, there was an occasion, near the close of 1910, when I was as secretive‚Äìindeed, as furtive‚Äîas any conspirator‚Ä¶..I do not feel it is any exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.‚Äù He went on to say ‚ÄúIf it were to be exposed publicly that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.‚Äù(1) Since its creation, the Federal Reserve has been successful in continually bailing out banks and shifting the costs to the American taxpayer. What else could we expect from a private bank that controls the monetary system of the nation?<br>  <br>  3. It is an instrument of totalitarianism:<br>  <br>   In July 1944, prominent socialists met at Bretton Woods and established the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). The creation of this world central bank created a common fiat money (money not backed by gold) which required all nations to inflate at the same rate. One theoretician who drafted the plan was John Maynard Keynes. He explained: ‚ÄúI felt that the leading banks would never voluntarily relinquish the then existing forms of the gold standard; and I did not desire a catastrophe sufficiently violent to shake them off involuntarily. The only hope lay, therefore, in a gradual evolution in the forms of a managed world currency, taking the existing gold standard as the starting point.‚Äù(2) The IMF is funded on a quota basis by its member nations. Of the nearly 200 member nations, the greatest share of capital comes from the United States, which contributes about 20% of the total. The IMF then exchanges worthless currencies for dollars so poor countries can pay their bills. The IMF and World Bank‚Äôs primary objective is to make loans to underdeveloped nations. These loans never go to private industries, but are given to  corrupt Marxist dictators. Some examples include Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Laos, Syria, Nicaragua and Poland. Through mass detentions, torture, planned famines, and resettlement programs, these governments have been responsible for serious human rights violations. The IMF/World bank is the prot√©g√© of the Federal Reserve. It would not exist without the flow of American tax dollars and the benevolence of American leadership. Thus, the Fed has become an accomplice in the support of corrupt regimes around the world.|`|3e46aef76b1fb84d0ce11d48fc610f4faa	It's a slippery slope which America will hopefully survive.|`|snzTCH5saa	You said it, Hello Marxism

pcHp7Dgkaa	Yes, those qualifications are sufficient to qualify at present but you must also have at least one year's experience though 3 years will earn you more points. The occupation will need to still be on the MODL when you apply though or you are wasting your time. Required occupations change all the time and there is no guarantee what will happen a couple of years or more down the track.<br>  <br>  Which is easiest?? You should be asking what you actually want to do. Nursing is a profession for dedicated people and you won't succeed if you don't have that dedication. Bricklayers need apprenticeships - school based training isn't enough.

I don't mind a tax based on a percentage of what someone makes but it should be the same percent for everyone no matter how much they make. If someone making 20k a year pays 1k in taxes then someone that makes 200k a year should pay 10k in taxes.

Local and state property taxes pay for that.What about national defense?

You can do anything from law enforcement patrols to flightline security to securing nuclear missile fields.  Most bases stateside are in 8 hour shifts, but overseas most are in 12 hour shifts. On active duty you can expect to deploy alot.  The rotation now is 6 months home 6 months deployed.  While deployed you could be working convoys or corrections at one of the prisons or air base defense or doing fly away missions with the aircraft.  It can be a very diverse job.|`|soOYac84aa	Well I cannot speak for everyone but EVERYTIME I go to the px the air force mp's doing gate guard seem bored as hell.... and don't know army rank structure, calling me SIR!!! what the heck... but if you want a relaxed job... find a job as an air force mp doing gateguard|`|8Fn1tYaJaa	I heard military police get treated the worst. o_0|`|nBjQQ3yraa	Husband was MP in the Army.

You see in a unmanipulated free market economy a country's trade of balance would almost be zero, because when you import goods you must export good to pay for the imports.

2uiuOpSvaa	Claims that there has been a constitutional violation by a state or local government are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.  (Bivens actions are actions against the federal government, generally, for the same type of things.)  There is one statute of limitations for a Section 1983 in that it does not vary by what the claim is BUT the statute of limitations is determined by the law of the state where the alleged offense occurred.  The statute of limitations for the federal claim is generally the applicable state statute of limitation period for personal injury torts (i.e., Missouri = 5 years; Arkansas = 3 years; Illinois = 2 years).  I think they range from 1 or 2 to 5 years.|`|Am2WeOdRaa	Statute of Limitations vary based on the specific law.|`|CowgOqXTaa	Only government agencies can violate the Constitution.

Ro03hVb6aa	Parliament won with Oliver Cromwell ending up something like supreme protector of England for the rest of his life after King Charles the Second was deprived of his head.  You might be best to ask in History.|`|LWbnAxaAaa	Charles the First (ruled 24 years, 1625-1649) had a very troubled reign; with pretty continual conflict between him and Parliament.<br>   <br>  In order to continue the current war with Spain, Charles' First Parliament (1625) granted 2 subsidies, but Charles refused to accept two of the conditions.  Also eight ships had been fitted out to attack Spain, but were used instead to help the Huguenots who were rebelling against the French government.  This gave rise to great dissatisfaction.  Meanwhile a fleet of 90 ships were sent out to take Cadiz from the Spanish, but that expedition ended disastrously.  Parliament refused to grant supplies without a redress of grievances  and Charles dissolved parliament.<br>  <br>  His Second Parliament (1626) was also dissolved because Parliament refused to proceed with business, due to a new set of conflicts with Charles.<br>  <br>  The Third Parliament (1628) passed the Petition of Right (which met the grievances under which the country was suffering)  - this Act being second in importance only to the Magna Carta.  But in 1929 Parliament defied the King's authority, and there was tumult in the House.  (The Speaker was forcibly held in the chair whilst resolutions against illegal taxation and innovations in religion were read and passed - although the King had expressly forbidden that they be brought forward).  Parliament was dissolved and three ringleaders were imprisoned in The Tower. (where one died in 1632). <br>  <br>  Charles then ruled without a Parliament (1629 - 1640), being aided by chosen advisers.  The Star Chamber and the High Commission Court exercised arbitrary rule.  These were very troublesome times, e.g. a Dr Leighton was fined, mutilated and imprisoned (1630) for writing a critical book; as was Prynne, a barrister similarly, in 1637.  <br>  <br>  Also in 1637, Scotland first resisted Charles' arbitrary rule of seeking to impose the English liturgy in Scotland.  Nearly the whole of Scotland declared "to resist the introduction of Popery and Episcopacy" and The Covernanters Army was formed to defend their rights.  Charles advanced to Scotland with an army that he could not trust, and was forced to conclude a treaty with the Scots at Berwick.<br>  <br>  Now being dreadfully short of funds, Charles had to convene his Fourth Parliament in 1640, (known as the Short Parliament).  This lasted only three weeks, and was dissolved because it refused to grant funds (subsidy) without a redress of grievances.<br>  <br>  Being still in need of money, and fearful of a second invasion from the Scots, Charles convened his Fifth Parliament (known as the Long Parliament).  This lasted twenty years (1640 - 1660), and is the longest, and the most famous, in British history.  Its first work was to remove the King's two "obnoxious" advisers and impeach them both; and then released various "troublemakers" from The Tower.  <br>  <br>  Numerous Bills seeking to strengthen Parliament and to wind back various of the King's arbitrary decrees were passed into Acts.  But one1641 Bill (the Root and Branch Bill) failed to get its second reading and had the effect of splitting up the Parliament into two parties, the Episcopalians and the Puritans.  In 1642 Charles failed in his attempt to arrest the "Five Members" - being leaders of the party opposed to the King.  He left London, never to return until just before his execution.  Both King and Parliament prepared for war.<br>  <br>  The Civil War (or Great Rebellion) 1642 - 1648.<br>  The Causes were (1) the determined opposition offered to Charles's arbitrary government by the Long Parliament; (2) The supposed encouragement given by Charles and his Queen to Popery; (3) Illegal taxation; (4) The unpopularity of the King's advisers.<br>  <br>  The more immediate causes were (1) the attempt made by Charles to seize the Five members; (2) The refusal of Charles to give up to the Commons the command of the militia, and of the chief fortresses.<br>  <br>  The division into Parties:  (1) London and the counties around it belonged to the Parliament party; the North and West with the counties near Wales, were inclined to the King; (2)  Many nobles and gentry, bringing with them a train of dependents, gathered around the King, whilst the Parliamentary army were made up of yeomen farmers, middle-class townspeople and artisans; (3) The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and the Church party, were on the side of the King, the Presbyterians on the side of the Parliament.<br>  <br>  The First Civil War:  the leaders were (1) Royalist:  the King himself, Prince Rupert, Newcastle, Hopton and Wilmot; (2) Parliamentary: Essex (C-i-C), Manchester, Waller, Fairfax and Cromwell.<br>  <br>  1642 The First Campaign - Battle of Edgehill, between the King and Essex.  Both sides claimed victory.<br>  1643 The Second Campaign - there were 6 major battles across England.  These clearly proved that both sides were fairly matched, and so both sides sought aid from outside England.  The King concluded a Treaty with the Roman Catholic Irish; and the Parliamentarians with the Scots.<br>  1644-45 The Third Campaign.  Again, battle results were indecisive.  The Independents in Parliament passed The Self-denying Ordinance "to deprive all members of Parliament of their command in the army within 40 days."  But Fairfax and Cromwell retained theirs by special Act of Parliament.<br>  <br>  Cromwell organized The New Model Army.  This led to The Fourth Campaign and a crushing defeat of the King by Fairfax and Cromwell at the Battle of Naseby (1645).<br>  <br>  In 1646, the King fled to join Montrose's supportive Scottish Army (which had actually been defeated at Philiphaugh in 1645), but in 1647 the Scots surrendered him to the English.  He was then imprisoned on the Isle of Wight, but still intrigued with the Scots.<br>  <br>  In 1648, The Second Civil War took place.  Induced by Charles, the Scots rose in his favor and invaded England.  They were defeated  by Cromwell at Preston and Warrington.  The King was  brought to London and imprisoned again.<br>  <br>  1649; Charles was tried by a High Court of Justice, found guilty of having levied war against his kingdom and the Parliament; condemned to death; and executed.<br>  <br>  Then followed:<br>  The Commonwealth, 1649-1653 (4 years).  "The Rump" parliament took the government into its own hands.  After various conflicts and oppositions, it was expelled by Cromwell who wished to bring forward certain reforms; and resolved further conflict by forcibly dissolving the House. <br>  <br>  The Protectorate, 1653-1660 (7 years). The Barebone's Parliament was summoned by Cromwell; with Oliver Cromwell as Protector.  He "oversaw" three Parliaments before his death., (1658).  His son Richard was declared Protector, but he was unpopular with both army and the "godly party", so resigned/retired into private life. <br>   "The Rump" was immediately recalled by The Army (1659), but was quickly dismissed for trying to bring the army under its power.  "The Long Parliament" was recalled, which having summoned a Convention, dissolved itself!  This led to Convention voting to restore the monarchy (i.e. Charles the First's son).<br>  Charles the Second ruled 1660-1685 (25 years)

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	Good question, but I would like to address several points.<br>  <br>  First, religion and morality are not the same thing.  In fact, historically they have often been at odds with one another (see, for example, the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Holocaust, terrorism in Northern Ireland, and 9/11, to name just a few atrocities committed in the name of religion).  You don't have to be a religious - or even spiritual - person to behave morally.<br>  <br>  Separation of Church and State was established to prohibit ANY religion from dominating governance over any other (and over non-believers).  John Adams wrote in the Treaty of Tripoly (1796), "The government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion."<br>  <br>  Not all of the founding fathers were "very religious" people.  Thomas Paine, Ben Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson were deists - they believed in God, but saw many flaws with organized religion.  Paine once wrote, "of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is none more derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more repugnant to reason, and more contradictory in itself, than this thing called Christianity."|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Actually, the Founding Fathers were mostly Atheist and Agnostic, and were quite critical of Christianity. <br>  <br>  <br>  As far as the separation of church and state...<br>  <br>  Some say that the separation of church and state is to protect government from religion.  This is wrong.<br>  <br>  Others say it is to protect religion from government.  This also is wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  The real reason behind the separation of church and state is to prevent any one religion from gaining control of the government, and with it all the powers of government like making laws and control of the armed forces/police, and then using those powers of government to outlaw and arrest anyone practicing a different religion.<br>  <br>  While the Founding Fathers were mostly Agnostic and Atheist, they felt that every person should be able to serve God as they saw fit for themselves.  They put a separation of church and state in the First Amendment to keep the religions from killing each other and forcing our government to a dictatorship.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Did you know that Iran is a democracy?  So why all the problems with them?  Well, it is because they don't have a separation of mosque and state.  That means that the government does any stupid thing it wants to do, and sees no problem with it because they believe they have Allah's backing.  And since Allah can do no wrong, He would never back a government that does wrong, so therefore the Iranian government must be right regardless of whatever stupidity it chooses to do.  Or so the thinking goes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Is that what you want here?  Government believing that it has the backing of religion, and by extension God, will do any stupid thing that it wants to do.  We already have enough of a problem with government running amok precisely because we have had far too many Presidents like George W. Bush, believing that God backs them for stupid things.  So they keep going and destroying morality, believing God backs them and so it can't possibly be wrong.<br>  <br>  Get rid of the separation of church and state, and they won't even care at all anymore.  They will literally believe everything is backed by God, and so they will lose their minds and establish a dictatorship.  We are too close already to get rid of that last protection provided by that separation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Combining religion and government does not make government more moral, in fact it makes it significantly less moral; all it does is make religion less moral as well.|`|AA11993638	You are 100% correct, it has nothing to do with the Church but rather to prevent the control of government on what people choose to believe. Thank you for pointing this out.|`|lWZi2p70aa	It is also to keep religions from endorsing candidates and influencing what is taught in publicly funded schools.  Moreover it is especially important in keeping morality from being legislated.  Jerry Falwell, when he was still alive, often said that perversion will not be stopped by legislation.<br>  <br>  Politicians in general could use a good slap with a dead fish "upside the head" to get their attention and bring them back to reality.<br>  <br>  But the tools the State has to regulate behavior should never, ever, be used to enforce religious morality, only to keep order.  Religion seeks to win hearts and minds and souls.  The State seeks to deal with spleens and livers.|`|Y0ZSWXqGaa	I do not want no right wing jive *** christian preaching to me! Stay in your church and stay out of the government, we have the constitution and that is good enough for me!|`|etcMARCAaa	They definitely didn't want the government adopting a state religion but they also wanted religious freedom for all citizens.  If the government passes laws regarding a religion in favor of others it's much the same effect as a state religion.  To understand the founding fathers intent, just remember these were independent people who more than anything simply wanted the government to stay out of their lives as much as possible.  They didn't want the government telling them where to pray, what to believe, what book to read and so on.  They wanted the government to simply keep the peace and otherwise leave them entirely alone. <br>  So yes they intended to prevent a state religion but even more they intended government to have no say about religion at all.  They believed that the citizens employ the government and the citizens could decide what to believe and how to worship without government help.<br>  As to schools, the founding fathers never intended or desired their government to handle education.  At that time churches did to some extent and there were private schools but mostly people were taught by their parents and studied on their own.  The founding fathers would have never supported a public education system because it allows the government too much influence on young forming minds and they knew very well how easily that could contribute to tyranny.|`|MDTj4U75aa	Well it is notable that the separation of church and state is no where in the constitution, and i believe it was first suggested by Thomas Jefferson (possibly) in a letter.  It refers to the first amendment and serves various purposes.  I  do not think that the church should influence the government, and i do not think that the government should influence the church, neither should be telling the other what to do.  However this doesn't mean that someone who has a moral issue with something else cannot deal with that due to separation of church and state.  Many of the issues Christians have with abortion and gay marriage are based on morals and biblical also, so really if someone says we cannot have a side on it and present it that way because we are religious, then they are limiting our rights, and are actually going against the constitution.|`|AA11974523	It is being used to cripple the Christian system while giving a helping hand to other religions with perks.<br>  <br>  It's weird how one religion can something denied while another can have it granted, in the name of separation of church and state.|`|9ib0tC9Waa	The constitution doesn't say to seperate church and state like alot of people say.|`|AA10313141	The religion portion of the first amendment means "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof".<br>  <br>  This basically states that religion doesn't interfere with government, and government doesn't interfere with religion.<br>  <br>  You are correct that the intent was to prevent the government from adopting an official religion, but that also includes religious persecution and the ability to freely practice whichever religion you choose, or no religion at all.  If the First Amendment simply prevent the state from officially adopting a religion, they could still adopt all of the tenets of that religion which would still make outcasts of everyone not following that particular religion/denomination.<br>  <br>  You're also correct that it is more often used by Democrats, but that's because Republicans cater to the Religious Right, who believe that many religious tenets should be adopted as law.<br>  <br>  Personally, I side with keeping as much separation as possible, but also feel it's important to understand where the religious views are coming from.  I fully support legalizing gay marriage because there is no reason for the government to restrict it - the opposition is fully religious based, as there is no actual harm in allowing gay marriage.  It doesn't infringe on anyone's rights to allow it, and the "sanctity of marriage" is solely religion-based, meaning by banning gay marriage the government is allowing some religion to infringe on the rights of others.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I fully understand the abortion argument.  While I am pro-choice, abortion rights come fully up to when you believe life begins, and if you believe it begins upon conception, then abortion is the murder of babies, which I'm sure everyone opposes.  While being pro-life is generally based in religion, I understand that if life DOES begin at conception, the government has a vested interest in not allowing baby murder.<br>  <br>  In short, most politicians might need morality, but preaching morality and practicing it are completely different things.  Religion is not the only source of morality, nor does following religion guarantee morality.
ZQZCJmD1aa	I've arrested 7 illegal mexicans in two weeks. 6 of them had pockets fulls of cash(since they don't pay taxes). Three of them were sending the cash in their pocket back to mexico. make it here, spend it there. ( for you idiots that think they are harmless, even you should be able to see that it hurts the economy when you makemoney here and dont spend any here) i was told by Immigration that they are under orders from Obama himself not to arrest ANY illegal aliens unless they are known gang members of felons. I was told I had to let them go. They didnt even want their names or addresses to follow up later. The old procedure was they would take custody of ALL illegals. Obama changed that in a short time. I am powerless to lock them up as a local cop. That is the sad state of affairs. You guys that don't care about it, how do you think you would be received if you went to another country illegally.

The larger problem is the number of illegals in our prison system.  <br>  <br>  - I suppose you are referencing Mexicans in your rant.  About half of the illegals each year come from Mexico, the rest from elsewhere including Asia, Europe and Africa.  <br>  <br>  -- a much larger problem is the million + victims of human trafficking into the US each year.  Please direct your outrage to this horrible situation as well.  There is 21st century slavery of the worst kind (usually sex slaves) and where is your indignation for THAT?|`|gYNDNXAkaa	Do you not realize that our economy in several states is dependent on illegal immigrant labor?<br>  <br>  They do the jobs most people don't want to do for a price no one else will take.

That way, if we grant illegal immigrants citizenship, they won't go on the dole.  In fact, my husband is a resident alien.  He is allowed to live and work here, and he pays taxes.  But, if he loses his job, he is not allowed public assistance.  Only citizens can get that.<br>  <br>  All, I am saying is that while we need to get a handle on the illegal immigrant situation, we also need to reform other aspects of our society.  We have plenty of room in our country to accommodate everyone, the problem is that immigrants tend to stay in certain areas.  No one is making them move to Alaska or North Dakota.  <br>  <br>  How much money should we spend of finding and deporting all the immigrants?  That sounds as expensive as letting them stay.  <br>  <br>  You haven't offered up any solutions to this matter, only defensive and condensending statements to people who care about other people's suffering.

Millions of pounds of drugs, cocaine, meth, heroine, and marijuana crossed into the U.S. from the southern border. <br>  We have 500,000 illegal criminal alien inmates at a cost of more than $1.6 billion annually. That includes 15,000 MS-13 gang members who distribute $130 billion in drugs annually. <br>  How would one of you far left bleeding heart libs like for one of your family members to be their next victim?<br>    In California, if 3.5  million illegal aliens moved back to Mexico, it would leave an extra $10.2  billion to spend on overloaded school systems, bankrupt hospitals and  over run prisons. <br>  <br>  The best way and the only way to stop Illegals from crossing our borders is to fire one warning shot and if that doesn't stop them make the next shot count.

It will be physically impossible to provided adequate food, clothing and shelter to 25 million illegal non-English speaking immigrants. When European immigrants came to the US, they were poor, but hard workers and honest master craftsman. Have you ever had a mexican work for you - it's like having a blind man paint your house. They are horrible. The skill-set is non-existent. <br>  The influx of poor, lazy, unskilled immigrants is going to drag the US down even further. We will never get out of this ailing economy and the immigrants did it to us.|`|CpTQagJOaa	I could not agree more!|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Holy h*ll, where to start...<br>  <br>  <br>  Well first off, illegal immigrants are the smallest takers of welfare; so we aren't actually paying that much for them.  We are paying quite a bit for white women, though (the biggest takers of welfare).  So should we kick out white women?<br>  <br>  I don't think so, so why in the world would I want to kick out someone who doesn't take anywhere near the same amount of money?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  More needs means more jobs.  More workers means more production.  Your little gripe would actually be much better for our economy, not worse.<br>  <br>  <br>  And while the illegal immigrants may or may not know English, their children are learning English quite well.  In fact, studies are now showing that they are learning English much better than American kids are.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And I take this stance because of my religious beliefs.  This is it, right here.  These are the least of Jesus' brothers.  When Jesus comes back and asks me if I clothed Him when He was naked, fed Him when He was hungry, etc.; I want to be able to say yes.<br>  <br>  I want to be able to say I fed the least of His brothers, clothed the least of His brothers.  And these are among them.  These are the ones in need, sons and daughters of God just like you and me.  They are our brothers and sisters, and it's time to ante up and kick in.

Only problem is, we didn't get the oil, China did.  And Iran got a new ally, because the new Iraqi Prime Minister (Nouri al Maliki) is allied to Iran.  That is why he won't let us use Iraq as a staging ground to intimidate Iran into backing off its nuclear ambitions.<br>  <br>  We are significantly weaker in Iraq, and we lost thousands of soldiers attaining that weakness.  That was all Bush.  He was the one who lied to Congress and to us to convince us to support him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Katrina.  Now I do not blame him for the immediate failings.  However, the man he chose to handle that mess had "horse judging" as his qualifications for the job at FEMA.<br>  <br>  And for the record, we got a lot of help sent from other countries.  Or we should have anyway.  Some countries sent money to help, totaling $400 billion.  China was among those countries.  What happened to that money?  REFUSED.<br>  <br>  Other countries that were too poor to send money chose instead to send food and medical supplies.  Iran was among these.  What happened to those supplies?  REFUSED.<br>  <br>  And Greece sent its two largest cruise ships to serve as housing for some of the displaced; ships that were capable of housing 1200 families.  What happened to those ships?  REFUSED.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  We literally could have helped New Orleans without spending a dime, because all those people the whole world over wanted to help us.  And what happened?  Bush and Michael "Hell of a job, Brownie" Brown refused ALL OF IT.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And our current economy is a mess because Bush wanted to fight the Iraq War, but not raise the funds to pay for it.  That means he had to borrow the money to pay for this war at extremely high (and exponentially growing) interest rates.<br>  <br>  When Bush got to office, he inherited a $4 trillion National Debt from Bill Clinton, and a surplus of $400 billion in the budget.  When Bush left office, the National Debt was nearly $11 trillion and the federal budget was in a $500 billion hole.  <br>  <br>  That means that going on National Debt alone, Bush managed to spend $3 trillion MORE THAN DOUBLE what all 42 of his predecessors needed 224 years to amass.  That is not even included the federal budget deficit.  That is what screwed up our economy so badly.|`|82e62204f1233511508a75bdb7acf417aa	quotes "He lied and lied and lied and lied and used fear and lied and used fear and lied and lied and lied and lied .

An example is Gitmo. Many people like to talk sh*t about Gitmo but they cannot come up with viable alternatives. Even some countries like australia were criticizing the detention of terror suspects but would refuse to take their own nationals who were detained there because they knew that those guys are dangerous and there isn't enough evidence to convict them so they'd have to be released. And no one was willing to have terrorists walking around scott free in their country. I think history will judge Bush more fairly than people are right now. I do admit though that the biggest mistake he made was the invasion of Iraq. Don't get me wron. I think Iraq was a threat, but not an imminent threat and could wait till we had Afghanistan sorted out  I'd have preffered if sadam was removed after the first gulf war.|`|k5WdChc7aa	People don't like George Bush because he wasn't a Liberal Democrat.<br>  <br>  People don't like George Bush because he didn't wake up, read the newest Gallup poll, and then pass all his decisions off the opinions of 1,000 Americans polled overnight.<br>  <br>  Limbaugh the Hutt:<br>  RE Bush's War in Iraq: Bush didn't lie to Congress. Bush was operating on the exact same intelligence that Bill Clinton had regarding Iraq - and Bill Clinton was quoted numerous times in 1998 and 1999 talking about Iraq's WMD program. <br>  <br>  RE Bush Katrina: Can't argue there. But in the end though, Katrina should have been nothing if the levies had been properly maintained. In the 1990s, Clinton gave billions of dollars to New Orleans to repair the levies. Obviously, that wasn't where the money went. And we'll likely never know where it went. But yes...we should have accepted the help of foreign nations after Katrina - including China and Iran's help.<br>  <br>  RE Bush Economy: If you look at it as just straight dollars, yeah - Bush hurt our economy alot. But since 2007, the US dollar has depreciated drastically (in part because of actions on both Democrat and Republican heads). We also had two wars going on.

FKJaQXQLaa	You will have to be a 31 if you want to operate the MG on a hummer.  However, you will be assigned one of two places with no choice in the matter.  Either you will be assigned to the Weapons Platoon in a rifle company, as I was or you will be assigned to Weapons Company.  Weapons Company manned the M2 and Mk19 and rode in hummers.  All of us that were assigned Weapons Platoon, had to walk with the riflemen.  We carried the M60E3.  That was retired back in 95.  Now they use the M240.  As I said, you will not have the choice of Weapons Platoon or Weapons Company.  You must be a machinegunner if you want to use one in the USMC.  Dont be fooled.  The M249 SAW is a light machinegun, but it is not on the same level as the M240.  It shoots a 5.56mm round, the same as the M16.  The M240 is 7.62mm.  Regardless of which unit you get assigned, being a machinegunner in the Corps is tons of fun.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	I know the Marines have a lot more Infantry MOS's than the Army, but in the Army the fire team assigned to that vehicle decides, usually the team leader.  I got to choose my gunner and then I cross trained all my soldiers so that they were all proficient gunners or drivers to the point I did those jobs as well so they would see me participating and see I knew what I was doing.  As gunner is usually a more junior position, it is likely to be one of your first duty assignments in your fire team, as long as it's in your MOS lane.

He does not present them as his own ideas or conclusions and then he gives his own opinion, or commentary, on what those articles mean.<br>  His persona of being always right, or correct, is a personal joke to all listeners.  <br>  When you express an opinion, it is always correct because your opinion is yours, no one can tell you an opinion is wrong, they can tell you that your facts may be wrong.  <br>  If people listen, they might hear something they didn't know.

He is a downright racist, and no integrity but to himself and to his friends. He's no better than Joseph Goebbels of the Nazi propaganda machine.<br>  <br>  He has to always try to find a way to get into the media because he only is concerned with making money.

I think Bush is a moron and he failed, but I NEVER wanted him to fail, cause if he fails, we all fail. Limbaugh was thrown off of ESPN for his comments about the Philly Quarterback only being successful because he is Black. We already know about his stupid statements during the election. He talks about how disgusted he is and wants harsh punishments for drug users and dealers, yet is exposed for being a user and getting his MAID to get the pills for him. Then he makes an excuse, and you followers swallow it. <br>  <br>  Ridiculous...

n6lgxa7Xaa	Hello I Love Sydney.<br>  The best way I can answer the great question you have asked, is to reproduce a letter written from a boss to his staff recently. It says it all.<br>  <br>  Date: 4 February 2009<br>  <br>  To All My Valued Employees,<br>  <br>  There have been some rumblings around the office about the future of this company, and more specifically, your jobs.  The economy doesn't pose a threat to your job. What does  threaten your job however, is the changing political landscape in this country.<br>  <br>  I started this company 28 years ago. At that time, I lived in a 2  bedroom flat for 3 years. My entire living area was converted into an  office so I could put forth 100% effort into building a company, which by the  way, would eventually employ you.<br>  I drove a rusty Toyota Corolla. I didn't have time to go out on dates. Often times, I  stayed home on weekends, while my friends went out drinking and partying.  <br>  Meanwhile, my friends got jobs. They worked 40 hours a week and made a modest $50,000 a year and spent every cent they earned. They drove  flashy cars and lived in expensive homes and wore fancy designer clothes.   My friends refinanced their  mortgages and lived a life of luxury. I, however, did not. I put my time, my  money, and my life into a business with a vision that eventually, some day, I  too, will be able to afford these luxuries my friends supposedly had.<br>  <br>  When you leave the office, you are done and you have a weekend all to yourself. I unfortunately do not have the freedom. There is no rest. There is no  weekend. Every day this business is attached to my hip like a 1 year old special-needs child. You, of course, only see the fruits  of that garden -- the nice house, the Subaru, the vacations.<br>  <br>  Now, the economy is falling apart and I, the guy that made all the  right decisions and saved his money, have to bail-out all the people who  didn't. The people that overspent their pay suddenly feel entitled to the same luxuries that I earned and sacrificed a decade of my life for.<br>  <br>  I am being taxed to death and the government thinks I don't pay  enough. I have state taxes. Federal taxes, Property taxes, Sales and use taxes, Payroll taxes, Workers compensation, Unemployment taxes, Taxes on  taxes. I have to hire an accountant to manage all these taxes and then guess  what? I have to pay taxes for employing him. On Oct 15th, I wrote a cheque to the Australian tax Office for $288,000 for quarterly taxes. You know what my "stimulus" cheque was? Zero, Zip,  Zilch.<br>  <br>  What is Kevin 07 Rudd doing with all my taxes? He's giving them  away to people who don't work as hard as me, to people who have never  worked and have no intention to, deliberately single mums breeding more  drones, recent migrants legal & otherwise plus their huge extended families. They  are told to spend, spend, spend - the very thing that got us into trouble in  the first place!. Go out and buy that you-beaut widescreen TV for say  $2000 of which $1,750 goes to China, the remaining $250 keeps the  salesperson & delivery guy in a job for another day & pays a franchise fee to  Harvey Norman. <br>  Now, to cap off mere financial incompetence, Rudd has risen to mind boggling levels of truly monumental stupidity by borrowing about 40 billion  dollars every year from foreigners, we don't have the savings here!.......  to GIVE AWAY!!!!. The State Labor governments have all been grossly  mismanaged, even QLD & WA are in trouble despite the good mining boom years, NSW is effectively bankrupt & VIC is not far behind, SA & TAS are  reverting to basket case status. The infrastructure funds are a thinly disguised  bailout to incompetent Labor mates in the States but at least that will employ Australians, however inefficiently.<br>  <br>  Rudd has blown what we thought of a huge multi-billion dollar surplus in one hit, in just one year!. But borrowing to give people $950 to spend  on goods that will employ Asians mostly?, that will make our current account  deficit worse and create a HUGE DEBT that will have to be repaid by us, our  kids and our grandkids. Taxes will have to go up drastically for decades to  pay for all this - there is no other way. Rudd's cure is going to be vastly  more painful than the illness, unemployment is still expected to  increase by 500,000 by the end of the march quarter 2010. Bringing forward the  next tax cuts would reduce that to 350,000 and if we were to spend stimulus  money productively on pipelines, bridges, hospitals, rail systems  etcetera instead of wasting it on $950 gifts we'd have to better off and have more  people in jobs.<br>  <br>  Rudd wants to emulate Obama's huge spending spree without realising that we simply can't do that. The US dollar is the world's reserve  currency, they can print money and it will still be worth a dollar, but if we  print 30% more money, which is effectively what borrowing does, our $A will  be worth 30% less which makes everything we import be it petrol or TV's 30%  dearer and so. Rudd plans to do this for four years to the tune of $200  billion! .... Despite Rudd often referring to Turnbull as the (wealthy) Merchant  Banker, Rudd, or at least his wife, has many more millions than Turnbull  and his family, most of it from Liberal Government training programs  ironically. We'd be better off if Ms Rein was running the country, her  husband's ego is such that he'd never listen to her unfortunately, at least they  will still be sitting pretty when it all goes pear shaped.<br>  <br>  It has been proven over & over  again in all Western democracies that for all tax brackets, for every $1 of  tax cut the multiplier effect is $3 - now that's a stimulus!. That stimulus  happens each year, every year because it's a gift that keeps on giving as  the saying goes. Give away $1 and that's it - spent $1 no multiplier effect,  this or any other year. Once Rudd borrows & gives it away forget about tax  cuts for a decade - think higher taxes, higher GST until we repay the huge debt burden he's creating. This is not rocket science! it's real, as  opposed to Rudd's fairy's at the bottom of the garden approach to ruining the  economy.<br>  <br>  Rudd's hero is Gough Whitlam, for those who are old enough to  remember, Whitlam came within a whisker of sending Australia bankrupt and the  country was saved from financial disaster by the Governor General, Sir John  Kerr dismissing his government. The Greens & Independents, being the  populists that they are, will pass Rudd's so called stimulus with minimal  changes. Let's hope  that Ms Quentin Bryce will likewise act with courage and conviction before  Rudd looks like losing the plot completely and takes us down with him.<br>  <br>  The question I have is this: Who is stimulating the economy? Me, the guy who has provided 14 people good paying jobs and serves over 2,200,000  people per year with a flourishing business?, or  the single mother sitting at  home pregnant with her fourth child by the latest unemployed layabout  who won't pay child support, waiting for her next welfare cheque? Obviously, government feels the latter is the economic stimulus of this country.<br>  <br>  The fact is, if I deducted (Read: Stole) 50% of your pay you'd quit  and you wouldn't work here. I mean, why should you? That's nuts. Who wants  to get rewarded only 50% of their hard work? Well, I agree which is why  your job is in jeopardy.<br>  <br>  Here is what many of you don't understand ... to stimulate the  economy you need to stimulate what runs the economy. Had the government suddenly mandated to me that I didn't need to pay taxes, guess what? Instead of depositing that $288,000 into the Canberra black-hole, I would have  spent it, hired more employees, and generated substantial economic  growth. My<br>  employees would have enjoyed the wealth of that tax cut in the form of promotions and better salaries. But you can forget it now.<br>  <br>  When you have a comatose man on the verge of death, you don't  defibrillate and shock his thumb thinking that will bring him back to life, do  you? Or, do you defibrillate his heart? Business is at the heart of  Australia and always has been. To restart it, you must stimulate it, not kill it.  But the power brokers in Canberra believe the poor of Australia are the  essential<br>  drivers of the Australian economic engine. Nothing could be further  from the truth.<br>  <br>  If any new taxes are levied on me, or my company, my reaction will  be swift and simple. I fire you. I fire your co-workers. You can then plead  with the government to pay for your mortgage, your 4WD and your child's future. Frankly, it isn't my problem anymore.<br>  <br>  Then, I will close this company down, move to another country, and  retire. You see, I'm done. I'm done with a country that penalises the  productive and gives to the unproductive. My motivation to work and to provide  jobs will be destroyed, and with it, will be my citizenship. There will be many,  many more small & medium sized businesses that do the same and between  us we employ 60% of all Australians in work and produce 68% of GDP (more  when<br>  China is not paying top dollar for everything we mine).  Fewer  people paying taxes mean higher taxes. Much higher taxes for the remaining  taxpayers who have no choice but to work. Countries like China are thrifty, have  all the money, and will own all the mines and a lot more because we will  have no choice but to sell them the family farm to pay our debt. That's  business - whether it's mine or the Country's.<br>  <br>  So, if you lose your job, it won't be at the hands of the economy;  it will be at the hands of a politician that swept through this country  changed its financial landscape forever. If that happens, you can find me  sitting on a beach, retired, and with no employees to worry about....<br>  <br>  Signed,<br>  <br>  Your boss|`|1iR3rxeMaa	well... personally i don't like him.. i don't know why i just don't... but its true... what happened to the economy was not his fault, and yeah he's giving out heaps of money buts it's only so that we could spend it on things that will return to the government anyway.. thanks to this global thing, people haven't really been buying as much as they used to....|`|ofP7bbX7aa	We only have printed paper to loose. It stopped having real value years ago. It is all electronically controlled numbers.  You want the debt to go away, press the red button Max!|`|KH9bbeCNaa	i like Kevein Rudd, his government only handed out 42 billion compared to the 700 billion in US, we are not talking out much, and the fact is we need the money to boost the economy, wat would hav john howard done? make the rich richer?<br>  <br>  thats why he lost power|`|DYnvacFVaa	I think that the country already had issues, we are all connected, we all rely on each others countrys to make money, when other countrys went into recession naturally we followed, Kevin rudd is giving out money in the hope people spend it which will help boost the econmy.  He knows if he gives it to the little people they will spend it rather then invest it or save it.  It might work well to.<br>  <br>  I guess time will tell, i dont really like Kevin Rudd but what happend to the economy wasnt because of him.
abJFBd7daa	Interesting question and one I think everyone would really like an answer to; Will Social Security be there for me? First off, social security per se, was a fascist idea nationally recognized by Benito Mussolini, an Italian dictator that joined the Axis powers in WW2 who (among many other policies) required that companies provide its workers with retirement benefits. Before he became a bad guy there were many progressives in this country who believed that a fascist form of government was the way to go and many of them sat as advisors to Franklin D Roosevelt to help him decide the nation‚Äôs policies. One man named Rexford Guy Tugwell, a member of FDR's ‚ÄúBrain trust‚Äù said of Italian fascism ‚ÄúIt is the cleanest neatest most efficiently operating piece of social machinery I've ever seen.‚Äù George Soule an enthusiast and supporter of FDR'S administration said ‚ÄúWe are trying out the economics of fascism without having suffered all the social and political ravages.‚Äù<br>   <br>           The idea that good things can't be fascist is a misnomer carried by those who choose to believe that all things fascist are bad. All ‚Äúsocialist philosophies‚Äù, Fascism, National Socialism and Communism were at one time looked at very differently in this country and seen as ideologies of great vision and hope particularly from those on the political left. . <br>  Dictator was not a dirty word in the 30's when  Walter Lippmann, a journalist proposed that Roosevelt should be  the first dictator for Mussolini had addressed his nations food supply, demanded an 8 hour work day, and abolished child labor. He made people productive again by strengthening workers unions and created an air of national honor and pride.<br>       The point to all this is that FDR took those things he liked best from Mussolini and incorporated them into American programs to help curb the economic trend of the Great Depression and social security was born. Originally FDR intended to remove the oldest out of the work force and provide them with a livable wage to illuminate the competition of young and old who were competing for the same jobs.    <br>  In 1939 a change in the law added survivor‚Äôs benefits and benefits for the retiree's spouse and children.  Some might suggest FDR only did this to achieve another electoral victory. In 1956 (Also an election year) disability benefits were added.  Keep in mind, however, that the Social Security Act itself was much broader than just the program which today we commonly describe as "Social Security." The original 1935 law (surprise! 1 year before an election) contained the first national unemployment compensation program, aid to the states for various health and welfare programs, and the Aid to Dependent Children program. <br>  Throughout the years as Presidents gave more entitlements out in an effort to be re-elected and win favor, social security eventually was paying out more than it was bringing in and it became a way for politicians to spend money it didn‚Äôt have for this program or that. <br>  A ponzi scheme? Consider this; Social security is bankrupt. The social security ‚Äútax‚Äù you make today comes directly out of your check and goes straight to a retired person non stop and unless the government reduces the amount of money paid to the retiree, it will go broke. If the government increases the social security ‚Äútax‚Äù and takes more out of your paycheck, your not going to vote for whoever did this, so I ask you; isn‚Äôt it possible Nationalized Health care, money taken out of your check automatically will be used to pay social security?<br>  Ponzi? Hell yes!|`|5ac40eaae3a66dcd680cf6c728f414adaa	Whoa, wait a minute...  The system was made to be self-financing as created originally. It COULD have been maintained as a self-sustaining, self-financing social security system, but wasn't. It wasn't until various changes, during the 1970-80's, in particular under Reagan and the pre-neoCons, that stripped aspects of the funding plans away such that we have what is unfairly called, by you and others, a "Ponzi" scheme.  <br>  <br>  Don't buy the argument that it's a Ponzi Scheme.  It just makes the swindlers and crooks like Madoff and others, including Ponzi, look not as bad as they are and were, and makes the government look worse than it is.  The ones to blame and hang imho are the congress persons who have diluted and have deliberately made the SSecSystem the weakened system it is now. They deserve to hang.  They deserve to be in jail instead of Roosevelt and his administration as what your SSS=Ponzi scheme implies.|`|G350VVknaa	What did you call it when Cheney and Bush wanted to make some bets with Social Security money in the stock market?

First, why does the government invest so much money in PLDT (PSE: TEL) where they say they are about transparency yet Manny did not change.  Polly is CEO of Smart not PLDT...really.  Manny named himself Chairman and then named himself Chairman of both the Independent Board Nominating Committee, that looks for all PLDT Board cronies, accept for the one SSS Administrator.  Let's talk about that for one moment.  Why would the administrator not pick someone whom has market experience.  President Bush tried to privatize Social Security, but he never said that he thinks that all the money should go to one company.  The corporate elite seem to have their kingdoms and the Philippine government, and soon President Noli de Castro (have you checked out his website, GMA's website is not so cool) will sell more of our precious Philippines to First Pacific and the Suharto/Bank of Central Asia leaders.  Former VP Al Gore had it right at least for the Philippine SSS.  We should stick it in a lock box or buy U.S. I Bonds at 4.5% and keep them in safes that can only be opened by a two person team in Equitable Bank including a thumb scan and voice analysis.  Then every year we should have a Singapore accounting firm count them and if anything is missing we can jail the two people.  We should also buy PHP500000000 worth of Certificates of Deposit through our Embassy in London and get the 6% yields they are offering. I wonder what would happen if the U.S. SEC terminated PLDT as a listing. How much would it be worth then?|`|AA10438532	yes, it's called social security.|`|eIhD4y8Waa	What a scam.Did you know that he first person to collect social security benefits Ida Mae Fuller contributed 24 dollars into the system over a three year period.She made 24 dollars a month,she received  22 dollars a month after retiring at the age of 65.She lived to be 100 years old and collected 23,000 dollars.Now that was a good deal especially in 1940.Pays to be at or near the top of the pyramid.The government is full of scams.How about the Federal Reserve,Woodrow Wilson later apologized for ruining the country.That has to be the biggest.It was done over night when many senators were away for Christmas.Jefferson warned us of this.The average age of great civilizations is 200 years,each of this civilizations has gone thru this cycle;from bondage and despair to spirituality,from spirituality to courage,from courage to freedom,from freedom to prosperity and abundance,from prosperity to selfishness,from selfishness to apathy,from apathy to dependence,from dependence back into bondage.
239408a05ab3d677baa2cb6f6930cffbaa	Because under the right conditions the Middle East situation could explode into a World War.  If Israel attacks Syria, there is a good change Iran will attack Israel.  That could lead to the United States attacking Iran.  That could bring China, Russia, and North Korea (and the rest of the Middle East) into the situation .  So, in my opinion its really not that far fetched.  <br>  <br>  Israel and Pakistan both have nukes....things just have the potential to turn bad.  <br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that this could potentially cause a 2nd depression in the United States.  China who are friends with Iran, do own about 30% of US debt, under certain circumstances, the US dollar could plummet on the world market, and since we no longer produce good in this country we could find ourselves in a very ugly situation.|`|9078f0ea65c9e120532e7a6297a4fb67aa	Because it's already started.

McCain supported the war that killed 1 million Iraqis, Obama did not. to me, that is a lot of change, as his orders to withdraw combat forces in 16 months, and stop our policy of torture. These are the facts. These are the reasons why I say there is change. These are not some fantasy sequence I make up to try to get other people who live in fantasy worlds to say something...ridiculous and absurd.

Rather, there has not been any economic reason for the market's high level since the mid-1980's. There was certainly no economic reason for it's resilience after the collapse of money markets in October. Apparently, a lot of traders had to wait around to figure out that no, Obama and Geithner can't just magically disappear the fact that the US economy has, in very large part, been replaced by a debt bubble since the early 1980's, but which has grown especially acute since 2001 (Bubba Clinton was slowly deflating the big bubble, but it went into tech equities and real estate, courtesy Greenspan. Bush came in with a GOP congress, did an about-face, and put the big bubble's inflation into overdrive). Seriously; much of our productive capability has been crowded out by speculation, traded off to China for a bunch of cheap, stupid, worthless consumer crap built by slave labor.<br>  <br>  Additionally, the short-term movements of the stock market are a horrible gauge of the economy's prospects. The market tanked when Bill Clinton entered office. It surged when Bush was appointed and 4 years later, elected*. Clinton left office and with the market at all-time highs. Bush left office with the market at 10+ year lows.<br>  <br>  *Not to imply that the 2004 election was legitimate.|`|F6A1saXxaa	predicting the stock market isn't rocket science...it's probably more difficult than that.

KKH9y0ECaa	American meddling is hardly a sentence, the US dropped more bombs on Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War than were dropped in the whole of the Second World War. It is estimated four million Vietnamese civilians were killed in the war and a further 1.1 million communist fighters.<br>  <br>  The US are the only country in the world to have used Nuclear Weapons on Two Civilian populations in Japan.<br>  <br>  The US Bombing and Occupation of Iraq from 2002 onwards  is estimated to have killed between 500,000 and 1 million Civilians, with some estimates putting the figure as high as 1.5 million, and there have been numerous US Massacres of Civilians (see below).<br>  <br>  Europe did have Imperialism but prior to the 20th Century it was an Imperialism of Muskets and Sailing Ships rather than the weapons of mass destruction we have today.<br>  <br>  America may not be as old as Europe, but in terms of Imperialism and killing it's catching up fast, and what it has already achieved in a few decades, in terms of death and misery is hardly a sentence. Neither is the discrimination and suffering faced by sections of America's own society whether they be Native Indian tribes or African Americans.<br>  <br>  Notable Recent US Massacres: <br>  <br>  The Haditha massacre <br>  <br>  The Haditha massacre refers to the incident where 24 Iraqi men, women and children were killed on November 19, 2005 in Haditha, a city in the western Iraq province of Al Anbar. At least 15 of those killed were noncombatant civilians and all were killed by a group of United States Marines. It has been alleged that the killings were retribution for the attack on a convoy of United States Marines with an improvised explosive device that killed Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Al-Mahmudiyah killings <br>  <br>  The Al-Mahmudiyah killings occurred on March 12, 2006 in a house located to the southwest of Yusufiyah, a smaller village, to the west of the larger town of Al-Mahmudiyah, south of Baghdad, Iraq in which five United States soldiers with the 502nd Infantry Regiment, SGT Paul E. Cortez, SPC James P. Barker, PFC Jesse V. Spielman, PFC Brian L. Howard, and PFC Steven D. Green (discharged before the crime was discovered), gang-raped and murdered a 14-year-old Iraqi girl named Abeer Qasim Hamza, after murdering her mother Fakhriyah Taha Muhsin, 34; her father Qasim Hamza Raheem, 45; and her sister Hadeel Qasim Hamza, aged 5. As of August 2007 Barker, Spielman and Cortez have been sentenced for this crime. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mukaradeeb Wedding party massacre <br>  <br>  An alleged wedding party in Mukaradeeb, a small village in Iraq near the border with Syria, was the site of American shooting and bombing on May 19, 2004. American officials stated that the location was a "suspected foreign fighter safe house." <br>  <br>  The wedding united members of the already related Rakat and Sabah families: Ashad Rakat was the groom and Rutba, his bride. Witnesses report that the American bombing started at 3am. Local accounts state that 42 men, women and children were killed during the incident. Among the known dead were Iraqi musicians Hussein al-Ali and his brother Mohaned al-Ali. Iraqi officials report 13 children were among the dead. 27 members of the extended Rakat family were killed. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Ishaqi incident <br>  <br>  The Ishaqi incident refers to the reported mass murder of Iraqi civilians allegedly committed by the United states forces in the town of Ishaqi in March 2006. After the incident, Iraqi police accused the US troops of rounding up and deliberately shooting 11 people, including five children and four women, before blowing up their house. A U.S. military spokesman at the time responded that it was "highly unlikely that [the allegations] were true". US authorities said they were involved in a firefight after a tip-off that an al-Qaeda cell leader, Ahmad Abdallah Muhammad Na'is al-Utaybi, was visiting the house. According to the Americans, the building collapsed under heavy fire, killing four people‚Äîa suspect, two women and a child. <br>  <br>  In June 2006 the US indicated they were re-investigating the incident, after the BBC obtained a tape from "a hardline Sunni group" that appeared to contain evidence supporting the allegations of the Iraqi police. The investigation found, on June 2, 2006 that US military personnel had followed the proper procedures and rules of engagement, and that they had done nothing wrong. (US forces, the report claimed, had initially responded to enemy fire upon them with small arms fire and then escalated force incrementally until the threat to them was eliminated.) Major General William B. Caldwell, a senior US military spokesman, said in an official statement that "Allegations that the troops executed a family living in this safe house, and then hid the alleged crimes by directing an air strike, are absolutely false." The Iraqi government immediately rejected the results of the US probe, stating they would continue their own investigation. <br>  <br>  Hamdania incident <br>  <br>  The Hamdania incident refers to an incident involving members of the United States Marines in relation to the shooting death of a possible insurgent Iraqi man on April 26, 2006 in Al Hamdania, a small village west of Baghdad near Abu Ghraib. An investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service resulted in charges of murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy associated with the alleged coverup of the incident. They were forced to drop many charges on the defendants. The defendants are seven Marines and a Navy Corpsman. As of February 2007, five of the defendants have negotiated pleas to lesser charges of kidnapping and conspiracy, or less, and have agreed to testify in these trials. Additional Marines from the same battalion faced lesser charges of assault related to the use of physical force during interrogations of suspected insurgents. <br>  <br>  The My Lai Massacre <br>  <br>  The My Lai Massacre was the mass murder of 504 unarmed citizens of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), mostly civilians and majority of them women and children, conducted by U.S. Army forces on March 16, 1968. Before being killed some of the victims were raped and sexually molested, beaten, tortured, or maimed. Some of the dead bodies were also mutilated. The massacre took place in the hamlets of Lai and My Khe village during the Vietnam War. <br>  <br>  The incident prompted widespread outrage around the world and reduced U.S. support at home for the Vietnam War. The U.S. military codeword for the hamlet was Pinkville, another name by which the massacre is known.<br>  <br>  World War 2<br>  <br>  Even during World War 2 many US Soldiers were hardly the Band of Brothers potrayed by Hollywood and the US Media.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/mar/27/thesecretwar" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/takenbyforce" rel="nofollow">http://us.macmillan.com/takenbyforce</a><br>  <br>  American sociologist and criminologist Professor Bob Lilly made unprecedented use of military records and trial transcripts to throw light on one of the overlooked consequences of the US Army‚Äôs presence in Western Europe between 1942 and 1945: the rape of an estimated 14,000 civilian women in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. <br>  <br>  In short, at a time when "French fries" and "French toast" were being renamed "Freedom fries" and "Freedom toast" because, unlike us, the French refused to join the Bush administration's war in Iraq, the American public did not want to be told that their fathers, uncles and brothers who had fought in the second world war - that "Band of Brothers" as the historian Stephen Ambrose christened them, and whose status as the "greatest generation" had been cemented by Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan - had, in fact, been involved in some of the worst crimes on mainland Europe, including black-market trading, armed robbery, looting, rape and murder. <br>  <br>  Indeed, secret wartime files that were made public in this country only in April 2006 disclosed that GIs committed 26 murders, 31 manslaughters, 22 attempted murders and more than 400 sexual offences, including 126 rapes in England, during 1942-45. <br>  <br>  Far from being the "greatest generation", Lilly exposes the ugly underbelly of the US army's behaviour in Europe, and it is that ugly underbelly that links his historical account of the murders and rapes committed by American soldiers between 1942-1945 with more recent attrocities. <br>  <br>  For the simple reality of Lilly's book is this: that young men - soldiers - who are given power over others, and have a structure surrounding them that closes ranks at the first sign of criticism, a structure which is, in turn, enclosed within a popular and political culture where members of the public want to invest in their father's or their brother's or their husband's decision to become a soldier and go to war with nobility and sacrifice are, in fact, the preconditions for abuse, torture and totalitarianism. As such, it is the duty of film-makers and historians and sociologists to expose that abuse - no matter how "noble" the individual soldier's sacrifice might seem|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Granted, most of Europe did the stupid things.  But does that mean they should not tell us when we are about to f*ck it up ourselves?<br>  <br>  If we had listened to France, we would not be stuck in Iraq now.  If we had not meddled in Iraq before, we would not have needed to be in Iraq in 1991 nor now.<br>  <br>  <br>  You're right in your assessment of the European situation.  But does that mean we should not listen and then wind up making the same mistakes?  Yes, they have a book where we have a sentence; but you are telling them to lay off telling us not to make our own book.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd rather have it where we didn't actually need them to be hypocritical; I think we should be doing this for ourselves.  As you correctly pointed out, the lessons are right there in history, we only need look and Europe won't feel a need to tell us to stop.

And let's not pretend US foreign policy bullying is a recent development-Cuba & Haiti have been on the receiving end of US intervention for the last century.

No, there is seldom a valid reason for abortion, after all there are several types of birth control and always plan B when you mess up. <br>  6) Do you believe we are a less free country these days?

Now, the union members, who were also the Corporation's customers, can't buy cars and have no jobs.  The Corporations can't sell their product, so everybody lost the fight!  The gap between the top and bottom, financially, has continued to widen.|`|AA11148986	Actually, before we had the Democratic governor Jennifer Granholm (2003-present), we had Republican John Engler (1991-2003), a close friend of Bush, and once possible VP pick.

Think about it most poor people have poor parents who probably also had parents.  When you are born poor you don't have as many opportunities as those who aren't.<br>  <br>  Now it becomes even harder for poor people to get an education and ultimately a good job.  Many have to help take care of their families instead of going to school.<br>  <br>  I congratulate you for being able to achieve so much when you were given so little.  You are one of those unique individuals with the ambition to take control of their life.  Unfortunately most people never dig themselves out of the holes they are in.  It's pretty sad but if you can do it they can to.  Most just never put forth the effort they need to overcome their poverty.|`|Ys8t1CFkaa	This is a very good question and I would like to spend one time answering it.<br>  <br>  Let me begin with mentioning this fact that life is all about choices. Good or bad, right or wronmg, your destiny will unfold according to the choices you make.<br>  <br>  Having said that, you can not deny the imperative role of circumstances, not that your future depends on circumstances today but circumstances you live at, can effect the decisions you make, therefore can be important. <br>  <br>  Usually people misunderstand the secret of successful people, they think success is a result of hard work, talent, luck ,‚Ä¶ while these factors can contribute to the results, the most important item is only decisions you make. Decisions such as when and whom to marry, what job to get, whether or not get a college degree, ‚Ä¶ these decisions and their consequences who happy you will be in your life.<br>  <br>  Now that I highlighted the importance of decision making, you may ask how I can make good decisions in life, well the answer to that part is quite simple; you need knowledge, experience, and instinct. Knowledge can be gained by studies and research. For example if you want to start a new business, you should get data and facts about market needs, and whether or not, it is a good idea to begin that business or not. Experience can be gained by learning from your mistakes or other people mistakes. (Certainly the second one is far better) surprisingly the website you just found, is an amazing tool to ask questions and learn from other people perspectives/ experiences. And the last factor for making decisions comes from instincts, listening to your heart; down there there is a light which is aiming at one specific choice out of many on the table. For me this usually works, when I want to do something important in my life, I always do research, ask other people opinions, study different aspects of my choices, both positive and negative sides, but at the end I listen to what my heart is telling me and make a suitable decision. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped, whatever your decisions will be, good luck with them|`|AA11148986	I think its a combination of the two.<br>  <br>  If you are born into a poor family, then obviously, you aren't going to have as many opportunities as someone who is born into wealth.

AA10313141	I feel the rich aren't taxed enough given that you can't become rich without somehow exploiting the poor, whether it's through price increases or underpaying your employees.  That is by definition profit - you make more money than something costs.<br>  <br>  Just the same, it's also obvious that there is a lot of government waste.   Any large organization will have a lot of waste - many private companies also follow the "use it or lose it" mentality, and also make unnecessary expenditures.  It takes about 2 minutes of watching the news to figure that out these days.<br>  <br>  In short, both are problems.|`|3e46aef76b1fb84d0ce11d48fc610f4faa	I know alot of rich people voted obama.

Under the current wartime environment offices were cautioned to not do the end of year waste which usually amounts to nothing more than expending your remaining budget on office supplies. Any money we had left at the end of the year was rolled into accounts to support the war effort. This had little effect on the next year's budget, but realistically it is a darn good way of adjusting your budget to what you really need. Almost like being good stewards of our nation's resources! Nice change!|`|ezQ44NqAaa	An argument can easily be made for both.After all,as a percentage of income,I'll bet you that Warren Buffet probably pays less than you do.In fact he has said essentially the same thing himself.He may pay a lot in total dollars,but since almost all of his money is made through investments,he pays a total tax rate of 15%.No Social Security,No Medicare,and a capital gains tax of 15%.On the other hand,the Government takes over 30% of my income every week,before I ever see a dime of it.<br>  <br>  However,we also know the Government wastes unbelievable sums of money.Lets use some recent examples,like Nancy Pelosi and all the other Representatives that get Government Supplied planes to fly them all over the World,including for Private Business.Do you think that when the Founding Fathers wrote in that Representatives could have their travel expenses paid to get them home,they envisioned Nancy Pelosi taking a Government Plane home every weekend at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars per year?Or the little get together Obama had,to celebrate passage of the "Stimulus Bill",where he felt it was necessary to serve the most expensive beef on the planet,at a cost of somewhere around $300/lb?The Government throws away money like it's free,like it just falls from the sky every Friday.But I guess for them,that's exactly what happens when they clean out everyones check every Friday.<br>  <br>  AD|`|leM3RQ5Haa	Seems some peoples glass is forever half empty.

And conservatives are freaking out because Obama is giving the military 10% less money then they asked for in their budget, LOL. <br>  <br>  However, the taxes rich people pay are more then fair, in fact they are both lower then most other countries and lower then we used to tax them in past, including during some of our best boom times after WWII.<br>  <br>  Now of course waste and mismanagement also has to be dealt with as well. But if both taxes for rich people were increased and the fraud and mismanagement in the government was decreased, our deficit would be a thing of the past.

fe57457146ff1608077b527bfec6f2dcaa	Divisions have no set number of personnel in them.  There are also several different kinds of Division.  Further the sizes of Divisions have changed over time.<br>  <br>  An Infantry Division during WWII was roughly 20,000 men.<br>  <br>  Today, the Brigade is the primary unit of the Army.  Divisions are Headquarters that coordinate the actions of multiple Brigades which are considered "plug and play."  To preserve historical lineages, current Army Divisions retain habitual relationships with specific brigades and as such most have 4 Brigades which can be a combination of Infantry and Heavy (Infantry and Armor combined) Brigades, plus an Aviation Brigade.  In a deployment decision, though one of those Brigades might not be deployed and instead a Maneuver Enhancement Brigade and a Fires Brigade be attached instead.<br>  <br>  But you seem to be talking about in Basic--you wont' have to worry about Brigades and Divisions there.  Instead, the highest element you'll come into contact might be Battalion.  Company and Platoon for sure.<br>  <br>  Basic Training is co-ed except for Ft.

a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Machine guns are designed for sustained fire.  They have high capacity feed mechanisms (usually belts), quick change barrels to prevent overheating and are fired from mounts such as bipods or tripods to steady the weapon.  Normally they are operated by a team of 2 or more men.<br>  <br>  Automatic rifles are fired from the shoulder in single shot or short burst fire, not sustained and are lighter and more easily carried and operated by an individual.<br>  <br>  In terms of operation the mechanisms often are not much different.|`|FKJaQXQLaa	A machinegun is generally .30 cal and above.  An automatic rifle, like the M249 SAW, is primarily .30 cal and under.  Machineguns are almost always belt fed and fired from either a bipod or tripod.  They are portable.  I carried the M60E3 in the Corps.  Automatic rifles can be belt fed and they are also magazine and drum fed as well.  Most MGs and automatic rifles are very similar in how they operate.  They can be open bolt or closed bolt.  A closed bolt weapon tends to have a higher rate of fire.<br>  Both types of weapons are very accurate.  An automatic rifle was designed to be fired from the hip and used from the attached bipod for increased accuracy and range.  The MG is mainly used from either a bipod or tripod and had greater range.  An automatic rifle is more for close in fighting and putting a high volume of fire on the target, while an MG is used as a stand off weapon to provide suppressive fire on the target.  It is best to utilize the maximum effective range of your weapon to do the most damage.  The M60 had a max effective range of 1100 meters.  A rifleman has a max effective range of 300-500 meters, depending on his weapon.  Imagine trying to walk through 600-800 meters of withering .30 MG fire just to get in range to shoot me.  Aint gonna happen.|`|vet4adaYaa	from my understanding, a "machine gun" generally uses a bipod or tripod.<br>  Now I live in California and have a few AR15's and quite a few AK47's, all semi auto of course, but if these were automatic guns most people in CA would falsely refer to them as "machine guns" simple because of the auto fire capability.<br>  <br>  An RPK is considered a light duty machine gun and is magazine fed.|`|XzStbSPnaa	A machine gun is belt or mag fed an assault rifle, is used as a more pratical weapon, better accuracy. smaller lighter, cant really carry an M-60 in for CQB but the MP-5 is sweet for that.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Machines guns are heavy fire weapons usually set on a truck or a tripod.

MGs are usually belt fed, and a cartridge is a a bullet+casing, cartridge ‚â† magazine, you've got your facts wrong|`|7idyT7Obaa	assault rifles are magazine fed.<br>  some machine guns (the SAW) can take a magazine but in general they are belt fed. <br>  simply put, an assault rifle that is fully auto can empty a clip of 30, reload, repeat a few more times then your out of ammo. if it doesnt jam first because its a closed bolt weapon and doesnt have a barrel designed to take that kind of heat.<br>  machine guns are seperated into light and heavy in general. light is like the SAW, which fires the same round as the m16/m4 but takes it in a chain, has a thicker barrel and an open bolt operation. most of the time a drum holds the ammo in either 50,100,or 200 round versions. infantry guys are able to carry it around and with some modification fire it from the hip or even shoulder.<br>  now the 50 cal is a HEAVY machine gun, if its carried its done so in 2 or 3 seperate pieces (including the tripod) although its generally mounted either on a truck or in a tower.<br>  assault rifles are light, accurate, and meant for a quick reaction time.<br>  hope that helps|`|9NcOBG8Laa	Assault rifles are automatic rifles designed to be portable (as to be used on an assault).

WfwFuQB0aa	oh this is such a hard way to learn a very valuable lesson and i am so pleased to hear your reactions. <br>  Now you need to resolve never to do it again, because next time you might get caught.<br>  <br>  there are a couple of options and the choice needs to be yours.<br>  <br>  1.  ring and ask for an appointment to see the manager of the store and if they ask why just say it is a personal but very important matter.   if you get fobbed off, which is likely, then ask to see the supervisor of the section from where you stole the pen.    keep the appointment and take the pen with you.     tell them what you did and give the pen back and tell them how you feel and how ashamed you are of your actions.     with any luck that should be the end of the matter (after a lecture) but if they did decide to go ahead and charge you, and sadly that is a possibility, then what you do to fix the situation would stand you in very good stead.    this will be hard to do.<br>  <br>  2.    ignore it and do nothing and just thank your lucky stars that you didn't get caught, live with it and try and move on.     this is the easy way.<br>  <br>  i know which i would do, but the decision is up to you.<br>  <br>  some say that it is the thrill of stealing and getting away with it, but you know that is not true.    <br>  <br>  remember every time something is stolen from anywhere the prices go up to compensate for the loss.    it is not the cost of the item today may be just a few cents but it builds up, just think if 1,000 people took something at just $1 that is $1,000. <br>  <br>  good luck with which ever way you go.      I am proud of you.<br>  <br>  edit:     after submitting i read that someone said to post it back and that will make it right.    i guess you could but does that really make it right?|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	Never heard of someone getting busted for reverse shoplifting|`|sw2R5A9iaa	return to the store with the pen and speak with the manager.  talk with your parents.|`|zEZF5ITMaa	You could mail the pen to the store with no return address from a public mailbox and write a note...<br>  <br>  I stole this pen.

You can apply direct but honestly, I'd suggest go to ADFA, get a degree fully paid for by the Army, AND they pay you a good salary during those years, then go on to RMC (its 18 months). Some jobs have clear career paths so your degree choice matters... check out the ADF site or call them up. The gap year looks great, but really why waste a year? Go straight to ADFA.

How old are you 10 years old? I know for sure sex education is now taught in grade school but some how questions like this do not surface unless the student is well known about sex in the first place.<br>  <br>  Everything does exist in this world we are in. Unsafe sex exist why because trouble with people is that they are trusting that their partners do not possess diseases until they found out the grime reality there after. Besides, if you fall for someone would you require that person if you are a woman to tell your lover to wear condom? I guess not. One of the main reason is that sex without condom is much more relaxing and stimulating rather than wearing one. Condom is like taking shower inside the bath tub wearing a raincoat so you won't get wet, so why try showering in the first place is it not?<br>  <br>  Another reason is that to a guy once a woman remove everything, the guy forgot all about the world he's in, all gone to the wind. I am a guy so I know what a body of a woman does. We all get crazy some how. That is why unsafe sex exist. So to avoid this, try having only one partner at a given time, unsafe sex is no problem. And avoid prostitutes for sure of course, they are the source of trouble in the first place. Once a guy impulse is to indulge to a prostitute be sure to bring out your fresh bought condom from the grocery or drugstore or suffer the consequence of your action.

If it is brought to the attention of a prosecutor--by anybody, including the police--the prosecutor will review the facts to see if criminal charges should be filed; which is true of EVERY criminal case. The best way to avoid a prosecutor filing criminal charges is not to break the law.<br>  <br>  BTW, this offense is NOT called "statutory rape" in California, it is called "unlawful sexual intercourse."  It is NOT a registrable sex offense.  And the posts which say that because the age difference is less than 3 years it would be a misdemeanor with a one year maximum jail sentence are completely correct.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	In a word, yes, he could be charged if someone wanted him to be charged.

The birth control would have no impact one way or the other. Even though it is a misdemeanor, it can still carry up to 1 year incarceration. It is best to wait until you are 18.<br>  <br>  Murlow12: If there is a less than 3 year difference in age and neither party is under 14 or over 21, it is a misdemeanor in California.

In New Jersey, where I live, I'm not sure what the law is, but I'm happy I've never had to learn that. In other states in the Mid-West, or south, he's probably screwed, and sadly, I mean literally. If he's 17, he'll probably be charged as an adult. You may not want him to be your ''boyfriend'' after he's Bubba's sloppy seconds.<br>  <br>  The fact is, he's an idiot for robbing an innocent person, but deserves remorse, abiding that he serves a suitable punishment. Hopefully, he admits to his guilt. He might have to give up the ''3 other people.'' With all due respect, why are you the girlfriend of such a loser? You can't pick your relatives, but you can pick who you date. He'll probably be taking your role as ''girlfriend'' in a nice Ohio state prison, unless his ''cop parents'' can afford a nice lawyer.Is it possible for his parents to get their kid out of trouble? Maybe, but it shouldn't be that way. This isn't like a traffic violation though. His parents are going to have to do some major *ss kissing to get this done. I still don't think it'll be enough though. If he doesn't learn now, he never will, and will be a career criminal.<br>  <br>  He should be greatful the person who he robbed didn't wake up and blow the sh*t out of his brains, because if he weren't running away, they'd legally be able to do so. On an Ohio cop's salary though, he may not be so lucky, if he goes to trial. Unfortunately, he's got to pay the price. What that price is determines on whether there were people in the house at the time. Whether he had a weapon or not. Whether he physically threatened people. Honestly, the fact that his parents are cops may actually hurt him. If anything, it'd be expected that he should know better. This has to be truly embarrassing to his parents, and sadly, will probably effect their careers and image in terms of acquiring promotions. A jury is made up of average every day people. Do you think a bunch of laid off factory workers in Ohio are going to show him any remorse?

Google how to calculate BMI if you don't know it.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	I think your max weight limit would be around 206 pounds for your height. I know that the max limit for someone who is 6'3" is 216 pounds and someone who is 6'2" gets a limit of 214 lbs. So I subtracted 2 pounds for every inch that went down, 5 inches equals 10 pounds.<br>  <br>  What happens if you don't make height weight is that they measure you for body fat percentages. How they do this is they measure your neck and then measure your waist (this is for males only, females have a different method). They subtract your neck size from your waist size and this gives them an approximate body fat percentage. <br>  <br>  Say for example you are 6'3" tall and weigh 220 pounds. You would not be within height/weight standards and would be "taped". Let's say that your neck tapes at 18 inches and your waist tapes at 38 inches. They would subtract 18 from 38 to give them 20, which would mean your body fat percentage is at 20 percent. <br>  <br>  Males in the Navy that get taped need to be under 23 percent, that does not mean that they can be 23 percent but it must be under. So as long as your under 23 percent you would pass the height/weight portion even though you don't fit in the standardized height/weight table.<br>  <br>  If you can't make either height/wieght or taping there are some things you can do to get yourself down. I suggest alot of cardio exercises especially running because your going to be doing alot of running in basic training anyways so you might as well get used to it now. <br>  <br>  What I did was mapped out a 3 mile path around my neighborhood and the first week just walked it every day. The next week I ran as far as I could and would walk until I caught my breath and began running again. I repeated this cycle until I could run the entire 3 mile distance without stopping. You would want to do this at least 4 to 5 times a week to help get your metabolism going. <br>  <br>  I would also suggest eating salads for meals. Not every meal but at least one meal a day.

fAaLjlI0aa	The problem is, the vast majority of 18 yr olds that want to drink are not going to stop at having a beer down at the pub. Before the 80's the drinking age WAS 18...and far too many 18 yr old kids were killing themselves and others by drinking, which is why the laws were changed. Since 1982, when the laws were changed, traffic deaths involving teenage drunk drivers (that is, between 16 and 20), has fallen more than 62%.  <br>  <br>  Of course I don't think you should be able to enlist until you're 21 either.

xWSIIOpaaa	Unfortunately, divorce in Italy can be finalized only through a court proceeding, and therefore your boyfriend will have to retain a lawyer to act in his behalf to start the court case and have the relevant documents served to his wife (in case she is Italian and living in Italy). This because she has to be forewarned by law and be given a certain amount of time to appear in court or appoint her own lawyer (if she wants to resist).<br>  <br>  Although Consulates usually provide legal advice for Italians living abroad, they cannot give advice about cases to be pursued in Italy, or recommend lawyers' names. In my opinion your boyfiend should find a lawyer in Italy (practicing in the same city where his estranged wife lives) who would accept to take his case and communicate with him only by e-mail or fax without meeting him in person (they usually want to see their clients in person, even if for just one time).|`|Dn63VUsVaa	Good luck to him...<a href="http://www.wheninrometours.com/Articles/Italian-Culture/The-Scary-Truth-About-Italian-Bureaucracy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wheninrometours.com/Articles/...</a>

v0TRB6T3aa	Conflict between the president and congress can still happen even if they are controlled by the same political party. The majority of today's congress is Democratically controlled, but it is not a huge, strong majority. So, the president still has to try to convince the congress-people from the minority party. Back in history, the president was to not be involved with any of congress' activities. He was just there to carry out the laws that are made by the legislative branch. So the Democrats probably aren't putting up much of a fight against President Obama, the Republican's(minority party) are making sure his suggestions are in line with their party's vision.

fAaLjlI0aa	First, call the police and tell them that he is threatening you, and having others threaten you on his behalf. Explain to them that you've learned he is a sex offender, and that is why he is threatening you. Did you sleep with him when you were 16 and he was 20? The legal age of consent in Illinois is 17, so that would qualify as statutory rape. Make sure this all gets on record. Also, according to Illinois law, if he has threatened you on 2 or more occasions and continues to attempt contact, he may be guilty of stalking. Tell the police he is on probation and ask that they help you find out who his PO is, then report him to that person as well.<br>  <br>  Next, go to the courthouse and file a restraining order based on the threats...not just against him, but against his mother as well for threatening you. <br>  <br>  Keep exact records of dates and times of everything: every conversation, every threat, every name.

zFsTSrOcaa	Yes, he can get in trouble.  He's technically committing fraud.  In addition, designated payees have to report how the money was spent, and failure to tell the truth is perjury.<br>  <br>  For proof of the children's residency, try school records or medical records.  Ideally, you want an official document with your signature on it that indicates the children are living with you.|`|1b9fbd13ce796d4a53e1675c60b78414aa	What should have happened, is that you would as the payee, simply notify SSA of your new bank accounts.  As long as the kids lived with your husband, it is likely he too was a payee and entitled to the money to support the kids.  <br>  <br>  However, he may have to pay Social Security back the money he stole if the children were not living with him more than 1/2 the time.  SSA payments are not directly affected by a court ruling persay, in that it only matters where the children actually live.  So if you have primary custody by court order, but the kids spend 51% of the time with dad, then he recievies the payments, and vice versa.  <br>  <br>  I suspect that what happened is that SSA contacted your spouse who showed them evidence that he is the primary care giver, who takes care of the kids more than 51%.  Chances are you need to prove to them that you are the primary care giver to the children.  I guess the kids are disabled, so you should have much proof that you care for them more.  <br>  <br>  So how do you prove you are the caregiver, since your husband has SSA over the barrell....I would record your conversation with him, if possible hide a video recorder in a place when you know you will meet him and talk to him about the problems you have.  Get him to mention that he's taking the kids for a weekend or complain to him how little he spends with the kids and get him trying to illicit a statement that he doesn't live with them.

SOCIETY is non-existence. There is no society in the first place if there are no rules or laws or regulations. IMAGINE, watching a basketball game, ok remove the rules or we call it no rules at all and no referee. Just play the game. Everyone will elbow one another, jump to side swept another to let him fall to the ground, before the time expire, most probably 3 players or more than that will be sent to the hospital yet the game is still on going. Blood all over their faces just to get that damn ball to the hoop. Take that example to a city or State, just imagine what horrible things will happen to it. <br>  <br>  My best example of no rules and laws is during the pre-historic times, where man and beast are protagonist. This is where T-Rex are wondering the hills and the surroundings. No rules you can virtually take whatever you want or like but be sure to rule fast too otherwise you will be eaten alive. So is there a society during these times? 3,000 years ago? The answer is no, not yet established or existed.|`|wE7lLCHSaa	Absolutely not.  It would become a free-for-all.<br>  <br>  I'd guess that if all rules were done away with, you would immediately see people form alliances/groups/gangs united under charismatic and power-hungry (not to mention well-armed) leaders.

It is human nature to organize into hierarchies (for sizable populations, at least).|`|aCILl7ctaa	Society as we know it would not exist without laws.<br>  <br>  People, in general, act only in their self interest, so without any rules or regulations there would be chaos.|`|Oq2EsRyMaa	Chaos.|`|hmwNRvUgaa	It sounds like you are speaking of anarchy.

One could look at Somalia currently in a state of anarchy. It is chaos. My friend is a refuge from there and speaks of horrors I will not say here. <br>  <br>  One school of thought suggests that a natural law will kick in and will find a balance as traditions and customs emerge. This sort of balance would require educated and group oriented population. A huge part of whether society would exist after laws were gone is dependent on trade as well. With trade comes order. <br>  <br>  But if the question is if we tossed out the US legal system tomorrow, I would say run for the hills because we as a whole are not ready for that. My 2 cents.|`|AA11584737	Gosh no, it wouldn't function at all. It would be mass chaos and most likely a vast majority of the world's population would be dead from their own ignorance.

eqZE40YLaa	What you're referring to is known as "A" school, which is where you go for rate specific training.

It varies each year.  Some rates have a shortage of people working in them.  Methods of advancement for rates with a shortage:<br>  1) USCG waives the servicewide advancement exam (SWE).  Guys ready to advance pass an end of course test (EOCT), complete their rate's practical factors (demonstrate knowledge of their rate's typical tasks), complete general military knowledge practical factors, some pay grades take a general military knowledge test, and then get recommended for advancement (promotion).  <br>  2) Sometimes the EOCT becomes outdated, USCG waives it.  Guys wanting to advance, complete their rate's practical factors, complete general military knowledge practical factors, some pay grades take a general military knowledge test, and  and then take an SWE and get ranked against all guys within the rate wanting to advance.<br>  3) In rates where there's a lot of guys and the EOCT is current, they must complete their practical factors, pass the EOCT, complete general military knowledge practical factors, some pay grades take general military knowledge test, and then take a servicewide exam and get ranked against all guys within the rate wanting to advance.  After taking the SWE guys on the list hope that the guys in their rate already working in the next higher pay grade get promoted quickly enough to create a vacancy for them before the next SWE application period starts.<br>  4) I don't think there's ever been rates where both the EOCT and SWE were waived simultaneously and the eligible-for-promotion guys just completed their rate's practical factors, completed the general military knowledge practical factors and passed the general military knowledge test<br>  <br>  Your family cannot come with you to boot camp or "A" school.  Or at least USCG won't pay for their moves and stays at Cape May, NJ and Petaluma, CA.  USCG will pay for your moves from your hometown to your duty station town.  <br>  <br>  During "A" school, everybody stays in the barracks.  They aren't open squad bays like boot camp, more like a college dorm room with 1-2 roommates.  You'll attend class, stand watch, do PT, study, take tests, follow orders, clean stuff, polish stuff, square away stuff and stand at attention.  There's a mess deck (cafeteria) and you wait in line for the food.  Grab a tray, napkin and silverware.  You'll have your choice of a few different entrees or sandwich/burger/hot dog, a few sides, milk/pop/juice, and desert.  It's been a while for me but I think cereal and PB&J is always available.  I appreciate the galley's effort.  They try to put out a variety dishes.  It's difficult because the dishes aren't individually prepared and cooked to order like at a restaurant.  The food is edible but it sure ain't mama's cooking.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your recruiter about receiving BAH with dependents versus BAH single.

This is from my experience with clients who owe debts and a training on small claims court. <br>  You will have more success negotiating  payment terms if you talk to the other side before the court hears the case. <br>  The most common plaintiffs in small claims court are debt collectors. They  know how difficult it is to collect. Therefore, they often agree to take voluntary payments over time. <br>  Usually you can negotiate payments but it is not typical both to pay over time and to get the total amount reduced. <br>  If you can pay most of the amount owed very quickly, you are more likely to get the total amount lowered.|`|BovpXrk1aa	30 days

Jefferson understood well that "freedom" is only gained through wealth.  When he wrote of freedom, he was referring to the tyrrany of taxation that was robbing money from the colonialists.  Think about it.  If you have money, you are not enslaved to creditors and those who have money.  Freedom.<br>  Freedom of Religion.  Was never intended to be interpretted as freedom FROM religion.  Maddison, Jay, Jefferson and Henry were responsible for writing what we now call The Constitution.  Henry wanted the ammendment to read that every man with voting rights  be required to be a member and pay tithings to a church.  Had this been allowed, we would have been no better than the British who paid homage to the Church of England which answered to the government.  That being the case, why fight the war?  Fortunately for us, they convinced Henry to run for Governor of Virginia.  Doing this, allowed him no say in the writing of the Constitution.  And the rest is shall we say...

This doesn't mean that it will stop snowing in one region. What it means is the average temperature of the entire planet is rising. This may lead to some extreme weather on BOTH ends of the scale. For instance global warming is melting the ice caps, which will release a lot of fresh water into the ocean lowering the concentration of salt and potentially disrupting the gulf stream current in the Atlantic ocean and stop it carrying the warm water up from the equator that Europe relies on for it's temperate climate, plunging it into sub-zero temperatures almost year round.|`|0cc280908f5890dc4f887659d66561b6aa	Snow is thick in some countries because it is very warm in others and it is the effect of global warming.

Lo mas parecido a PUEBLO UNIDO que vi aca en argentina al estilo VZLA fue el 20 de diciembre cuando una gran parte se dio cuenta que nos estaban metiendo el dedo en el culo, y salio a protestar.

Siempre del lado de los ilusos, en vez de buscar inversionistas serios en pa√≠ses con credibilidad. Y si la idea fuera protestar contra Bush, ser√≠a muy absurdo, ya que dudo que el presidente yanqui se preocupe por quejas de Don N√©stor, √©l gobierna y se hace lo que √©l dice. Por su parte, creo que Ch√°vez est√° completamente loco, y nuestro presidente argentino anda payaseando con √©l en vez de resolver las cuestiones de fondo en su gobierno. Y cuando la cosa se calienta, sale con el discursillo de la dictadura y  saca a alg√∫n viejo del stock para hacer un juicio medi√°tico que distraiga a los tontos.

Berlusconi ha il carisma per tenere unito tutto il centro destra senza grandi problemi. Verissimo anche che la sinistra √® tutta insieme solo ed esclusivamente perch√® contro-Berlusconi, non per interesse del Paese. Tornando all'eredit√† pesante. AN √® un partito storico... che negli ultimi anni con Fini ha messo proprio Fini in evidenza. Per√≤ ha un partito alle spalle. Forza Italia pi√π che un partito √® Berlusconi in persona... quindi dipende troppo da lui. L'UDC sappiamo tutti da dove arriva. Al momento i due leader sono naturalmente Fini e Casini...solo che pur essendo buoni leader....non poli dello stesso segno, nel senso che insieme non ci stanno. Uno troppo da una parte e uno troppo dall'altra. Berlusconi li tiene insieme alla perfezione...ma loro due soli non penso funzionino. Uno esclude l'altro. La Lega potrebbe rimanere con AN, per√≤ diventa difficile prch√® √® molto legata a Forza Italia. Il prospettarsi di una grande coalizione di centro che secondo me avr√† a capo Casini √® piuttosto probabile, anche se sinceramente non la auspico. C'√® anche il rischio di tornare a una DC new-style. Dovrebbe cadere il governo a breve...e risalire ancora Berlusconi...per poi magari alla prossima elezione votare Casini per il Quirinale e Fini come leader del centro-destra. Oppure Berlusconi al Quirinale. Ma questo fra 7 anni. <br>  Molto in gamba secondo me √® Tremonti, per√≤ lo vedo perfetto come capacit√†, ma meno pratico come carisma...insomma meno trascinatore. Sarebbe perfetto se si avesse una larga maggioranza di elettori. La soluzione migliore per avere un vero partito dominante secondo me pu√≤ riuscire a farla proprio Berlusconi prima di lasciare...o magari anche prima delle prossime elezioni, ossia creare questo famoso Partito Unico. Partito Nazionale si dovrebbe chiamare. Convogliare FI, AN e UDC in un unico partito con l'appoggio della Lega, creerebbe un forte impatto di stabilit√† e di concretezza...e darebbe la possibilit√† di avere al governo un Partito unico e non una coalizione. <br>  Speriamo che accada. Il leader....per 6 anni ancora Berlusconi...poi si vedr√† come evolvono Fini e Casini.<br>  <br>  CLONIAMO BERLUSCONI!!!

Kevin Kline stars as the title character who must impersonate the president of the United States after the real president suffers a massive heart attack which has left him in a coma. "Dave" goes for laughs, but also has a great deal of drama which keeps the audience intrigued throughout. Frank Langella does some of the best work of his career. Sigourney Weaver, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin, and Ben Kingsley are all perfectly cast in supporting roles. The screenplay is smart and the direction never loses its focus. 4.5 out of 5 stars. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0106673/trailers-screenplay-E20433-10-2" rel="nofollow">http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0106673/trail...</a><br>  <br>  Plot Summary for <br>  Dave (1993) <br>  Bill Mitchell is the philandering and distant President of the United States. Dave Kovic is a sweet-natured and caring Temp Agency operator, who by a staggering coincidence looks exactly like the President. As such, when Mitchell wants to escape an official luncheon, the Secret Service hires Dave to stand in for him. Unfortunately, Mitchell suffers a severe stroke whilst having sex with one of his aides, and Dave finds himself stuck in the role indefinitely. The corrupt and manipulative Chief of Staff, Bob Alexander, plans to use Dave to elevate himself to the White House - but unfortunately, he doesn't count on Dave enjoying himself in office, using his luck to make the country a better place, and falling in love with the beautiful First Lady...<br>  <br>  Dave Kovic looks so much like President Bill Mitchell that he's asked to stand in for him, while the Bill occupies his time elsewhere !. When Bill falls into a coma, a secret and highly illegal plot is hatched by Bob Alexander to keep Dave on as the president. Unknown to Dave, Bob is working on making himself president, but he doesn't count on Dave being so popular and keen to continue.<br>  <br>  Summary written by Rob Hartill<br>  <br>  President Bill Mitchell is not exactly an ideal President. He looks after those who helped get him into office than the people, and he is a philanderer. One of the ways that he keeps his little dalliances a secret is to hire a lookalike to impersonate him and when he is at a function at a hotel, his double is the one the press and media see leaving the hotel, while he stays behind for his little rendezvous. Now the man whom they have hired is Dave Kovic, a goodhearted man who likes to help people find jobs. Normally after making his little exit that would be that but Mitchell suffers a stroke. Now he is completely incapacitated, and by law the Vice President will assume his duties but Bob Alexander, Mitchell's Chief of Staff who is just as corrupt and ammoral as Mitchell maybe even more, fears that the Vice President who is boy scout, will probably not play ball with him or not keep him around, tells Dave that it's in the country's best interest that the Vice President not take over. So he agrees to continue pretending to be the President. But in reality Alexander is planning to smear the Vice President into resigning thus paving the way for him to be President. But when Dave becomes infatuated with the First Lady, and when Bob acting in Mitchell's place, cuts off funding to one of her projects, she assumes that it was Dave as Mitchell, who did it. And so to make it up to her, he restores the funding, which infuriates Alexander. Which means that Dave and Alexander are headed for a clash.

As their unlikely friendship develops, their courage overcomes the prejudice and corruption of their adversaries." (dvd box)  this movie earned Hanks his 2nd Oscar.  <br>  <br>  It is one of my personal favorites. The role of AIDs as prejudicial is it's own discriminatory star of the movie. How AIDs  developed as a life-threatening illness in the US and abroad demonstrated how easily prejudice develops re: homosexual relationships, drug users and others show how a cultural mind-set can gain ground through discrimination.  This movie shines the light into all the dark corners surrounding the illness and also demonstrates how strong family and other supportive measures make a difference.

That is the biggest reason people get denied, because they cannot prove they have enough "ties to home".  If he owns any property, has a lot of family at home, a job offer waiting for him at home, etc, he should mention it all.  The job tends to be the most convincing factor--if he can get a letter from a company guaranteeing him a job for when he returns, this will help his visa interview go a lot smoother.|`|d715b9218d9d28667bc5d2bb5115d7e6aa	Search Google|`|0WLSvVY5aa	Consultation is always better.

b23077569cf6feb2eb101a1224151b3caa	Well Iraq, and Korea are different. Short tours. If you go to Korea, in the middle of your year there, you can take what is called a mid-tour and fly back on your own expense to see family, that's what I did. Some don't. Iraq is a deployment. The Air Force is there for shorter amounts of time than the Army or Marines, who serve year tours over there. So not time enough for you to have to fly back and see family. But if you get a regular overseas tour like say Germany or Italy or England, these are typically 3 years tours, typically. And depending on your job or command you can take as much leave as you have. I flew back 3 times when I was in England. Hope this helps.|`|21820de46ccb734b2be60ff4ea057eaeaa	once a year....maybe!!|`|Smx7BqGKaa	i believe that you get to go back home one a year for 30days.|`|d4bf6d71592dde0aca080eacd67c961aaa	You can take 30 days leave each year (depending on your command's mission requirements) and you can go anyplace you want.

Swear to God that you won't torture me!" 8For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!" <br>  <br>   9Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" <br>  <br>     "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many." 10And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area. <br>  <br>   11A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. 12The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them." 13He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. <br>  <br>   14Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. 15When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 16Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man‚Äîand told about the pigs as well.

While all branches are elite in their own way, you have to identify what your wants and needs are to determine which will be best.<br>  <br>  In my experience, the airforce takes care of their troops much better than the other branches - this leads to better rations, cleaner facilities and more overall individual freedoms.<br>  <br>  The Marines, from what I have heard, are by far the hardest (outside special forces, seals, recon etcc...).  The training is supposed to be much harder than the other branches.  As far as how they care for their soldiers, I really am unsure.  I would assume that since they are the smallest of the branches, that they have the smallest budget and forced to make a lot of cuts when it comes to Marines individual comforts.<br>  <br>  I have no experience with the Navy or anyone in it - so I cannot help you there.<br>  <br>  The ARMY is probably the happy medium.  They are the largest of the branches (I believe) and I have to say that in the 8 years that I was in the ARMY, while I enjoyed it and learned a lot, there were times when I wished I was in the Air Force.  (Like when we were in Iraq, the AF guys had AC etc....)<br>  <br>  You should probably go talk to all the recruiters that you can and see what info they give you.  Then, once you get that info - try to find someone that is in that branch but not a recruiter, and confirm the info that was given to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|015e22d1e7a54d79bce5552a8120c85faa	DO NOT SHAVE YOUR HEAD.

They also have single female marines that they call "barracks rats"...you don't want to be one of those! Females get bad reputations on ships as well. The branch you choose all depends on what you want to do. Navy is a good branch if you are interested in medical and don‚Äôt mind being stuck on a ship all the time, the Army gets stuck in Iraq for the longest period of time, I don‚Äôt know much about the Air Force besides that marines call it the ‚Äúchair force‚Äù, and my husband is air wing in the Marine Corps so I don‚Äôt know much about the infantry side of the Marine Corps‚Ä¶beside that most of those guys are crazy!

UK officials are waiting to be granted access to the HMS Cornwall staff, who were seized on Friday, and have not been told where the group are held. <br>  <br>  "It simply is not true that they went into Iranian territorial waters and I hope the Iranian government understands how fundamental an issue this is for us," Mr Blair said.<br>  <br>  "We have certainly sent the message back to them very clearly indeed. They should not be under any doubt at all about how seriously we regard this act, which is unjustified and wrong." <br>  <br>  On March 23, 2007, U.S. and British officials said a boarding party from the frigate HMS Cornwall was seized about during a routine inspection of a merchant ship inside Iraqi territorial waters near the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway.<br>  <br>  The seizure of two Royal Navy inflatable boats took place just outside the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab waterway, a 125-mile channel dividing Iraq from Iran.

A 1975 treaty recognized the middle of the waterway as the border.<br>  <br>  Iranians send arms to Iraqi extremists, including sophisticated roadside bombs. This week, two commanders of an Iraqi Shiite militia told The Associated Press in Baghdad that hundreds of Iraqi Shiites had crossed into Iran for training by the elite Quds force, a branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard thought to have trained Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. <br>  <br>  Regarding enrichment of uranium, Iranian President Mahmaoud Ahmadinejad abruptly cancelled his appearance before the U.N. security council and in his stead, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki Iran spoke.  He indicated that Iran was willing to continue negotiations but without the precondition that uranium enrichment must be halted.  <br>  <br>  Mottaki said, "the world has two options to proceed on the nuclear issue: continued negotiations or confrontation.

47cfe75a8340b688519f0435fbf413a4aa	You can marry in any country you like so long as you get a marriage certificate that's recognized by their government. Some countries have short residency requirements (ranging from a couple of weeks to a couple of months) for marriages. As far as I am aware, you need to file for a K3 (for your spouse to come to the US and wait for a green card) in the country where you were married. So she would have to stay in the UK until her visa was approved. <br>  <br>  Some embassies in some countries perform DCF (direct consular filing) for US citizens. The process is much much MUCH easier (and cheaper) than the K3. It takes about a month to get the physical (and other visa requirements) done. Once she has her interview with the consular officer to determine that it is a 'true' marriage (you need to show your wedding photo album), she will be granted a visa to the port of entry in the US. When she arrives in the US, her green card will arrive in the mail a few days later. (Quite unlike the K3 where she would have to wait a couple of months - without a job - for an Employment Authorization and then wait some more for the 'conditional' green card and then file again in 2 years to remove the conditions.) <br>  <br>  Be aware that embassies only provide the DCF as a courtesy. They are not obligated. You will have to make a request at the US embassy in the UK. <br>  <br>  Also to the poster who related her(?) experience, you have my sympathies. Your experience was probably among the worse ones because Egypt is a third world country and an Arab one at that. Their embassy has likely seen quite a few scams so they err on the side on safety. <br>  <br>  A last point, I believe DCF can only be requested by US citizens and not by US permanent residents. Although I could be wrong and people should check all the same since rules and regulations could change at any time.|`|7cnLaQZNaa	If you have a marriage certificate, it does not matter where you were married, it will be legal here.|`|pA0RcHELaa	If you marry in UK the wait to bring your spouse to the USA can be long. I just found out the hard way. If you wish to marry you should file here for a fiancee visa soon as your sure. They will give one in about 4-6 mos. Then you have 90 days to marry in USA. If you marry in UK you will have to leave your spouse there, and come back here alone to file. Go to www.uscis.gov the wait right now for me is 7 months before my husbands petition will even be looked at.  I spent four months in Egypt, I was honest, I paid lots of money for all documents to be translated, we own an international business, and it had been very heart breaking to find out that we did it all the wrong ways. I went to the US Embassy in Cairo to be treated like garbage and not given a straight answer one time. They treated my husband like he was a criminal to the point that I had my own investigation done and he has never broken a law or been in any organizations in his 40 years on earth. Do your homework, the embassy will not give you much information, all foreign marriages are believed to be shams so there is a long hard process for your spouse to get visa to come the USA. You can marry anywhere and yes it is legal, but the wait to bring your spouse home can be long and expensive. I wish you luck. Look at forms I-129f vs 1-130

He will be away for several months for his initial entry training. That is basic and AIT. Then he will have weekend drills every month and a multi week drill once a year. Other than that he will be home doing whatever he wants.    As far as training goes it depends on what he does in the NG. He will have 11 weeks of basic training. That is getting you used to military discipline, structure, PT, marksmanship, and various classes. Then you will have AIT. That varies on length depending on what he wants to do.

National Guard is deployed a lot more than people tend to think. Coast guard as far as i know doesn't go out of the country so maybe he could look into that. Also basic training and advanced individual training (AIT) can be anywhere from like 3 months til a year or more. I'm going to be gone for basic and AIT for 10 months. Go to sites like goarmy.com and do so more research.

They are same|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	1. No, US citizens can be born abroad to one or two US citizen parents or people who have a green card and fulfill all the requirements can become naturalized US citizens.     2. If you have a green card, you are not a citizen, you are a permanent resident of the US.     3. Being a naturalized citizen is a category in citizenship: you are either a citizen by birth (natural born in the US or abroad to US citizens) or you become a citizen by naturalization. So someone who is already naturalized is a citizen.|`|9LWuWHiMaa	a green card holder is a legal resident, not a citizen, this person can do everything except vote, have federal jobs and file petitions for family members (you can file if you intend to apply for citizenship but if you do not apply your petition will sit in the immigration office)    a citizen is someone who is born in the united states or someone who was naturalized. upon naturalization you give up allegiance to your former country of citizenship and our now in allegiance to america so you can now vote, have federal jobs and file petitions for family members|`|0b87103374738a74c6669593b14b6307aa	If you are a citizen you were either born in the USA or became a naturalized citizen    If you have a green card you are a legal permanent resident, once you have had a green card for a certain number of years you can apply to become a naturalized citizen    Once you have been naturalized you have citizenship in the USA, so they are really one and the same.

6sjphNcPaa	it was appropriate that he apologized|`|EX1GjjJCaa	It needs to be legalized. I started a few years ago in high school and am now a freshman in college going pre-med. I've always been a straight A student. I was the DECA president at my school, and I represented my school, state, and the country in the International Conference, scoring in the top 20%.    Marijuana does affect short term memory, so basically when you do it don't do it when you're supposed to be learning. It has no effect on long term memory, and is actually proven to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's in people over 50 who smoke it. Look it up.    There is not one single death linked to the smoking of marijuana. There is no link between smoking marijuana and any diseases.  I myself would not even consider it a drug. To me, it is simply a weed.  And when I smoke it it relaxes me and relieves stress. Why do you think they prescribe it medicinally? Because it does do good for your body. Especially if you work out, it releases tension in the muscles and soothes you.
HMsgbFENaa	I don't believe that it will ever be achieved nor would people be happier for it. First of all communism/socialism has a history of not working. There are always people in higher positions that take advantage of it.     Second, from a practical standpoint it is not going to work. Sure for the first generation or two it amy rely on the idealism of the theory. Yet, by the 3rd or 4th generation of workers things are going to get dicey. People are going to wonder if their neighbor/friend really is working as hard as they are. People want to be rewarded for their work and not have to pass of their rewards for people that do not do as much.     In addition, a class system will evolve. Even if everyone is paid the same there are going to be people that have had more education (doctor's, lawyers, engineers, politicians...). These individuals will start to associate only with themselves and not with other individuals. They will recognize that they have had more schooling/training and are going to desire more money. Even if it doesn't come to this they will become an "educational elite" which goes against the theoretical basis of communism.|`|DBIKou8faa	Absolutely, unequivocally NO!    Wash your mouth out with soap!!!|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Check out North Korea.    It has economic equality for the people.

Would they have done it if they knew government was just going to take what they worked for and give them a pat on the back?|`|RANWeh9Uaa	I will break it down in very simplistic terms.     If I had a successful business and my neighbor did nothing except sit on his rear all day. Under the socialist or communistic view half of what I made would belong to my lazy neighbor.     there would be no incentive for me to run a business or work as I too could sit on my rear and do nothing and get half of another persons money.    Our current Governmental system is bent on rewarding the lazy and punishing the workers. This is where we have been headed for a long time under liberal leadership.    The lazy will be very happy - the workers would revolt so no it is a very terrible idea|`|4lINNvG5aa	Not possible.  It is against human nature.  Libs can't understand that fact.  It was demonstrated in the POW camps of WW II.  Some prisoners would become "rich" with cig, chocoholic even booze.  Then the camp would have to be moved or the guards  would come in and confiscate everything.  Lo and behold, a few months later the same guys were "rich" and the same guys had nothing.

If everyone had one million dollars, then one million dollars would be worthless.|`|1AgD0dsBaa	My Dear,    Socialism-Communism, is a very bloody history. Unfortunately Communism is an idea that is good on Paper that Engels wrote about KARL MARKS  Communism ideas to a Utopian society.     The history of Communism leads to A Marxist Dictatorship rather than an actual equal society. Equality in a system of all items shared by wealth does not happen in reality. No matter how much people try, A Utopian Society has many flaws. Manly Humans who try too hard to control the masses. Economic equality is a Shift in Human ideology that the world believes we all can attain the same financial balance that the elite 3 percent of the world.     Heavy industry, High-tech society, Equal rights. Humanity has been moving in the right area as far has to developing equal rights for humanity. However the act of Socialism, Communism have failed in every aspect of History. China and Vietnam still exist, but cannot exist with out Economic trade and growth of its Gross National Product. Which means Capitalism, until there is no real need to put a Value on goods and services, Social Economic Equality will never exist.       Read about the French Revolution-Under the FIRST REVOLUTION.  THIS BECAME THE MODEL FOR ALL NATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN THE LATE 19TH, Early 20th Century Revolutions in the World. Most nations followed this with the Stalinist Idea of Communism. However, some countries also ran Nationalist movements under the Banner of Communism because that was the only form of Idealism offered to them at the time. So examine both the French Revolution, and Communism under Stalin, and Mao. If you find that Socialism or Communism will bring Social Economic Equlity in our time, I will stand corrected.     But as far as Socialism, Communism, they have both failed in all aspects. Mixed Goverments have a better chance of survival.

And Richardson is already being investigated, he just forgot to tell them until after the press brought it to their attention.

He either needs to go back to his country and apply for a fiance visa (it takes months) or you go to another country and marry him there then upon your return to the US, you can immediately petition him for a green card (green card application takes 9-12 months depending on how busy the service center in your district is).|`|yTdQUqVRaa	You can get married on a tourist visa, and so long as you are a US resident, you are eligible to adjust his status within the US, so he wouldn't have to return to his home country.    You will be looked at a lot more closely than others, since they'll assume that he lied when he entered the US regarding his intentions and will also look even harder at your relationship.    Start by filing an I-130 with the USCIS.    Good luck!|`|0b87103374738a74c6669593b14b6307aa	OK - So there are 2 schools of thought on this.    1. Your b/f entered on a temporary visa, which means he is only supposed to be here temporarily. By marrying you and applying for his green card that shows he intends to stay here permanently... which is visa fraud and could result in deportation and fines for you.    2. You are not SUPPOSED to enter on a B1/B2 and then get married and apply for your greencard.  But Immigration does look the other way if you can convince them you didn't plan to do this and that your realatioship is real.    I have known people over the years that have done what you are proposing, some had experience 1 and some experience 2. So it really depends how much you are willing to gamble.  If you want to roll the dice then here is what you need to do.  First get a license and get married. Then print out these forms from www.uscis.gov    I 130 - Petition for Alien Realtive - Filing Fee  $335  I 485 - Application to Adjust Status - Filing Fee  $1010  I 131 - Application for Travel Permission  I 765 - Application for Employment Authorization  I 864 - Affidavit of Support  G 325 - Biographic Info     You only have to pay filing fees for the 2 top forms, everything else is free.... I 131 & I 765 are optional, but as they are free you may as well file them.  Your then husband will also need to go for an immigration medical, details of where this can be done can be found again at www.uscis.gov  cost is anywhere from $300 - $500.  He will need proof on any vaccinations he has had throughout his life, or he will have to have them again. They will take blood, test for HIV, syphillis, and other diseases. The results (after 3-5 days) of this will be given to you in a sealed envelope - DO NOT OPEN IT - send it with your application forms.  You are also going to need to send copies of your tax returns and pay stubs, this shows that you earn enough to support you husband.  If you don't make enough then you will need to find someone else, perhaps a family member to be a co sponsor.  You will need copies of Drivers Licences for both of you, Passport for him, both your birth certificates, marriage certificate (which can take 1-2 weeks after you get married to come through) You will need passport photos - each form gives a detailed list of what you need to send as supporting documentation.  Having said all this, if his I 94 expires in April, you have a little over 2 months to get everything done... you really should get started now and get married ASAP if you are serious about this.    I hope this gives you a good starting point..... you may want to consult a lawyer... it isn't necessary and I guess depends on your financial situation.  I believe that you also have to be 21 or over to petition for a spouse to get a green card. Good luck.|`|9LWuWHiMaa	honey file a petition go to www.uscis.gov, click on immigration forms, look for Form I-130 Petition for Alien Relative.   You also need to file TWO Form G- 325A one for you and one for your spouse.  You also need to send a money order with approximately $350 us dollars with you application. check the price at the website but i know it is over $300 and les than $400.  also this is serious business so speak to a immigration lawyer who can advice you instead of putting him and yourself in danger. a lot of them do free consult but if you have to pay the hundred dollars if it means a peace of mind    this should get you started|`|CZfrGC1yaa	If you are a US citizen, you need to file I130 and he should file I485 along with your I130. If his I94 expires, make sure he does not leave US until he has his green card in hand. Should take between 6-12 months to get his green card.|`|IyaTdu52aa	Listen is better if he goes back to cali, i was in the same situation. (we are both cale?os) you petition for him on a I-129 petition for fiance and it shouldnt take any longer than 8 months. I know it seems like a lot but is not. Once he is here you get married. Send the petition with marriage certificate ( they give you 3 months to get married) send the green card app and he then gets work permitt, needs to go get his finger prints. Then he gets his social and then the app at the immigration office, then he gets his temp green card. Three months before he has stayed her for 3 years you have to send the app for his permanent residence and thats it. Our process took from the time i petition him from her to cali six month. I sent the app i remember on Oct 24 2006 and he got here April 23 2007. We got married May 25,2008.   Que Dios te bendiga y si necesitas algo me decis.  Chao

f74fb35875fa4e25e1470711558d7f65aa	People are taken care of when disabled, unemployed or too old to take care of themselves, and no questions asked medical care, the terms or words used in particularly regarding the NHS when it was established after the war was '' from cradle to grave ''    But back then it wasn't abused like it is today, today benefit spongers are like a cancer growing all the time and sucking the system dry.    If you have a slight limp, why not make that into a stagger and they will give you a free new car every three years, and if you have any money, give it to one of your relations to hold for you so you can still screw even more benefits out of the system, or give people so much money that its hardly worth going to work, so why not stay at home with your five kids and drink beer all day and then complain like a Twat that the immigrants are taking all your jobs, then pretend your outraged by it by voting BNP.    That's what the British welfare state means today, and what a state it is in!|`|PwHQSAxvaa	This is the tax and welfare system in the UK, particularly the tax known as National Insurance, which was originally ear-marked to fund the state retirement pension, and later sickness and unemployment benefits (though this tax still exists there are not realy any permanently ear-marked taxes anymore.)    The welfare state has expanded into a comprehensive system of cradle to grave health care (the NHS - though patients are now charged for some elements of the service, such as prescriptions, if they can afford to pay, wigs, surgical supports, dentistry and opthalmic services, though children, unemployed, pensioners and pregnant women are exempt from most charges) and a large list of state welfare benefits, including unemployment payments, sickness, maternity, incapacity, carers' allowance, disability allowances, widows' pension etc.    Most benefits are dependent on a condition being satisfied, such as being unemployed without significant savings. Others, such as child benefit, are paid universally regardless of wealth.    The system has expanded in recent years to include a system of tax credits.    To look at the history of the welfare state there are particular events to look at.  National Insurance Act 1908 (Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Liberal government)  The old "Poor Law" prior to this gave responsibilty for such matters to local authorities, charites and churches, and generally blamed and punished unemployed people for getting in that position  The Beveridge Report (1941-44)    Notice the date of the Beveridge Report - during World War 2 - Beveridge was a Labour politician in a coalition wartime government with a Tory Prime Minister. The Beveridge Report finally reported in 1944 recommending a sweeping reform of welfare provision. This report was the framework for creating the NHS, in 1948. The report also advocated full employment (not more than 3% unemployed) and Keynesian economics.    There have been several attacks on the welfare state, the first by the Labour government who created the NHS, introducing prescription charges after just a few months, by the last Tory government, who famously would not increase benefits by a suitable rate, and tended to blame unemployed people and single parents for being a drain on resources, and again by the current government, who likes to occassionally attack the vulnerable to pander to public pressure.|`|AA12121752	A bloody great farce, it seems.

Review ALL the paperwork that was involved with the sale (maybe you missed something about it?) then contact them.  Ask them how the plan to remedy the situation and tell them what you expect from them.  Take it from there.<br>  <br>  If the situation gets out of hand, you may have to decide if it's worth it to go to court.  It may end up being more cost than it's worth to you for a paint defect that was remedied.
zCaeaTJgaa	I certainly wouldn't be asking this question on a website.  Call a lawyer.  Most lawyers won't charge for asking such a simple question.  They aren't likely to take a case before knowing some simple facts.  I usually call at least a couple before deciding what course of action to pursue.  Get a few opinions from professionals, then hire one if need be.  I used to work at a dealership, and you can expect to be given the run around if you take the car back to them.  <br>  <br>  As far as I know, what they have done is illegal.  They probably pocketed the money to fix the problem, and then sold you the car. If you decide to handle this on your own,  I would ask them for documentation that the problem was fixed and a written gaurantee that they will fix it if you have a future problem.  Or, ask for a full refund and a different car.<br>  <br>  The next time you purchase a car, insist that the dealer show you the CarFax vehicle history report.  This includes a list of ALL previous reported title changes, insurance claims, etc, etc.   It's a great way to protect yourself from problems like this.

Ma in Italia difficilmente √® realizzabile una cosa del genere e i motivi sono sia a livello di societ√†, sia a livello politico, sia a livello degli stessi enti. Questo perch√®:<br>  1) ogni acquisizione che riguarda uno stato e quindi la stessa gente, deve avvenire sempre dal basso;<br>  2) Anche se la riforma federalista venisse dall'alto ben pochi politici si priverebbero di poteri a favore degli enti locali;<br>  3) Ci sono troppi enti il che creerebbe lentezza nell'applicazione dei fondi e delle leggi ( come purtroppo sta accadendo ancora tuttora).<br>  Qusto √® per come la penso io; una riforma giusta ma che attualmente non pu√≤ trovare posto perch√®, c'√® una politica troppo interessata a mantenere a menterere intatta la serie di propri privilegi, si aggiunge poi la lentezza burocratica che si creerebbe con gli attuali enti locali. <br>  Ci sar√† forse una speranza in un futuro quando la classe politica cambier√† e si svecchier√† ( e questo spero che possa avvenire molto presto), poi bisogner√† togliere un ente locale, quale la provincia (in quanto √® un ente che ha un peso politico, ma non ha un vero territorio fisico in cui esercitare, in quanto la provincia √® costituita da comuni), rafforzando regioni e comuni; essa rester√† solo a livello nominale e resteranno gli organi direttamente competenti dallo stato ( esempio la Motorizzazione Civile etc.).

6pJPAEFNaa	En la creaci√≥n de las leyes para el Distrito Federal y tambi√©n, de aquellas leyes que son obligatorias en toda la Rep√∫blica, intervienen el Poder Legislativo federal, representando por el Congreso de la Uni√≥n (C√°mara de Diputados y C√°mara de Senadores) y el Poder Ejecutivo, cuyo ejercicio se deposita en el Presidente de la Rep√∫blica. Pueden tambi√©n intervenir, en algunos casos, las legislaturas de los Estados (Congresos locales), trat√°ndose de reformas a la Constituci√≥n federal. <br>  <br>  <br>  Las fases del proceso legislativo son seis: iniciativa, discusi√≥n, aprobaci√≥n, sanci√≥n, publicaci√≥n e iniciaci√≥n de la vigencia.<br>  <br>  <br>  Iniciativa. La iniciativa es la facultad que tienen determinados √≥rganos del Estado para proponer ante el Congreso (Poder Legislativo) un proyecto de ley. Dicha facultad pertenece en exclusiva, de acuerdo con el art√≠culo 71 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos:<br>  <br>  <br>  Al presidente de la Rep√∫blica;<br>  <br>  A los diputados y senadores al Congreso de la Uni√≥n, y<br>  <br>  A las legislaturas de los Estados<br>  <br>  <br>  Discusi√≥n.- Es el acto de las C√°maras, que consiste en examina un proyecto o iniciativa de ley polemizando sobre √©l para decidir, por medio de la votaci√≥n mayoritaria, si debe ser aprobado o no. Las iniciativas de ley deben ser discutidas sucesivamente en ambas C√°maras, pudiendo comenzarse en cualquiera de ellas, salvo que se trate de proyectos sobre impuestos, contribuciones, empr√©stitos o reclutamiento de tropas, pues en estos casos deber√°n ser discutidos primeramente e la C√°mara de Diputados (Art√≠culo 72 constitucional, inciso b)<br>  <br>  <br>  Aprobaci√≥n.- La aprobaci√≥n consiste en dar las C√°maras su asentimiento o conformidad a una iniciativa de ley. La aprobaci√≥n tiene lugar cuando la mayor√≠a de los miembros presentes han otorgado su voto afirmativo al proyecto que previamente se ha discutido. Obtenida la aprobaci√≥n en una de las C√°maras (la de origen, por supuesto) el proyecto deber√° ser remitido a la C√°mara revisora para su discusi√≥n; y en caso de ser tambi√©n aprobado por √©sta, se enviara al C. Representante del Poder Ejecutivo para los efectos e que se tratar√° enseguida.<br>  <br>  d) Sanci√≥n.- Se llama sanci√≥n al acto por medi√≥ del cual el C. Presidente manifiesta, bajo su firma, su conformidad con una iniciativa de ley aprobada por las C√°maras. Dicho funcionario puede negar su asentimiento, en ejercicio del llamado derecho de veto, en cuyo caso la iniciativa ser√° devuelta con observaciones a la C√°mara de origen, donde ser√°n discutidas √∫nicamente dichas observaciones.<br>  <br>  e) Publicaci√≥n.- Una vez que el proyecto de ley obtiene la sanci√≥n del Poder Ejecutivo, tiene lugar la publicaci√≥n o promulgaci√≥n, que consiste en dar a conocer la ley a quienes deben cumplirla. Para que una ley pueda obligar a su cumplimiento, debe ponerse al alcance del p√∫blico el texto de la misma. Antiguamente, las leyes se publicaban de viva voz, dando lectura de ellas en las plazas p√∫blicas por medio de pregoneros o de heraldos.<br>  <br>  Hoy se recurre al procedimiento de imprimir las leyes en peri√≥dicos especializados: el Diario Oficial de la Federaci√≥n, trat√°ndose de las leyes federales y de las relativas al Distrito Federal. En los Estados de la Rep√∫blica existen los peri√≥dicos o gacetas oficiales, donde se publican las leyes locales respectivas.<br>  <br>  f) Iniciaci√≥n de la vigencia.- Para determinar la fecha a partir de la cual las leyes entran en vigor, existen dos sistemas: el sucesivo y el simult√°neo.<br>  <br>  El sistema sucesivo funciona de la siguiente manera: las leyes, reglamentos, circulares o cualesquiera otras disposiciones de observancia general, obligan y surten sus efectos tres d√≠as despu√©s de su publicaci√≥n en el peri√≥dico oficial. En los lugares distintos del en que se publique el peri√≥dico oficial, para que las leyes, reglamentos, etc., se reputen publicados y sean obligatorios, se necesita que, adem√°s del plazo que fija el p√°rrafo anterior, transcurra un d√≠a m√°s por cada cuarenta kil√≥metros de distancia o fracci√≥n que exceda de la mitad.<br>  <br>  Este es el sistema prevenido por el art√≠culo 3¬∞ del C√≥digo Civil del Distrito y Territorios Federales, el cual tiene algunos inconvenientes, ya que no se?ala si la distancia entre los lugares distintos del de la ciudad de M√©xico y √©sta habr√° de medirse en l√≠nea recta, siguiendo las carreteras, v√≠as f√©rreas, etc.., adem√°s de las dudas y del desconcierto que acarrea la circunstancia de que una ley haya entrado en vigor para la capital en cierto d√≠a y, un mes despu√©s a√∫n no haya comenzado a regir en los lugares fronterizas. En virtud de esto, se ha recorrido a otro sistema.<br>  <br>  El sistema simult√°neo, las leyes, reglamentos etc., entran en vigor en todo el territorio a partir del mismo d√≠a: la fecha que en la misma disposici√≥n legal se se?ale, siempre que la publicaci√≥n se haya hecho con anterioridad.<br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado.

VKrePQZqaa	I don't know what kind of ID, it depends. But if you have a birth certificate and passport I would assume that's enough. However more importantly is obtaining your Social Security Number. Go to the Social Security Office and see if you can obtain one along with a card. This would greatly benefit you in your future, primarily because the number is used for a great number of important purposes.
AA11206283	Can you try? Yup.    Win? Not happening.    Proving damages and intent are just not probable,|`|ErvhPYlbaa	Yes it is possible to win if you can prove damages.  If it's physical, you'll need pictures, medical bills, etc.  If it's psychological or mental, you'll probably need a really good story and possibly a letter from a mental health specialist.

Background  When an immigration petition or application is denied or revoked by the USCIS, that decision may, in most cases, be appealed to a higher authority for review. In immigration proceedings, the appellate review authority is divided between two separate government agencies: the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) within the USCIS, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), under the jurisdiction of the Executive Office of Immigration Review, United States Department of Justice.    If a petition or application is denied or revoked, you should carefully review the written decision that is issued by the USCIS. The notice will inform you of the reasons for the decision, notify you of the proper appellate jurisdiction and the applicable deadlines, and provide you with the correct USCIS form to file an appeal.         How Do I Appeal?    For more information on the procedures for the two appellate authorities, please see one of the following:    Administrative Appeals Office: How do I Appeal the Denial of My Petition or Application?   Executive Office of Immigration Review - Board of Immigration Appeals Website  http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/m...    look under   related links   right side...of page|`|IyaTdu52aa	usually about 6 to 9 months before you can apply again.|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	Depends why you were denied. Most often, no, you cannot apply again.

On the whole, he seems to be a notable exception.    Generally, I think that the riches of politics attracts people who were already liars and thieves.  There is just so much wealth and power, that I think that few can get to the highest levels of power without being backed by some power brokers.    The few who get there with pure intentions may find that they soon have to sell out to get anything done.  Of course, I don't excuse good intentions.  It's sometimes these people that you *really* have to watch since their ideas (though honestly motivated) are often horrible and dangerous.|`|QNGzjvRKaa	I knew one once and all the BS talking etc around him discouraged him from running for a second term.|`|fc0b719eb616ba86e30fd23f51659547aa	Power = corruption|`|CgGVpUI5aa	Those people cant get into politics.

AA10425248	Generally, if the Court sentenced you then let you out on probation, your sentence on a violation will be the original sentence (6 months).  The Court may still have the option of reinstating your probation, if your violation wasn't serious.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	That depends on so many factors.  The original charge, how long is left on the probation, the history of the presiding judge, etc.     Edit:  Sorry, poster  1, I didn't see your answer and pretty much said the exact same thing!  lol|`|QT0qTFyAaa	If you need legal help seek a lawyer.|`|YPvyvDzQaa	How much time did you or the person originally serve of the six months?

He has enough Democrate Senators to have it pass, all the Senate Republicans can do is slow it down.      He doesn't need anyone to sign it, he needs a few to sign-on (so he can say that it had bipartisan support). If what you say is correct (that he needs two Republicans(, it must mean that some (4 or 5) Democrats are voting against it, since they are in the majority in the Senate.    The stimulus package won't do much for the country, but it will provide a lot of money for Liberal causes.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Say "filibuster" you nitwit!

Mutatis mutandis  non vorrei che in Italia  capitasse un poco come in Irak dove chi √® curdo vota un partito curdo,  chi √® sunnita non voter√† mai un partito sciita eccetera.

Mi si che hai letto qualche libro scritto da vanna marchi.<br>  Edit: si scusa adesso ho capito!<br>  <br>  domanda interessante, peraltro esposta in modo un po misterioso per il linguaggio a cui siamo abituati. :)<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  marx ha spiegato il capitalismo e le sue contraddizioni, sostenendo che tale sistema √® destinato a fallire proprio a causa delle contraddizioni generate.<br>  <br>  altro non ha fatto come qualsiasi scienziato che analizza un fenomeno.<br>  i borghesi non sono interessati al futuro dell'umanit√† ne adesso ne 150 anni fa.<br>  per loro ci√≤ che conta √® il profitto fine a se stesso.<br>  la chiarezza della sua analisi √® stato un vantaggio esclusivo al fine di condurre il proletariato al comunismo.<br>  trattasi di un processo storico, non di un movimento personalistico di marx.<br>  lui non aveva mire di potere, non come lo si intende nel senso di un leader politico borghese, disposto all'inganno per arrivare al potere.<br>  marx rappresenta la forza del proletariato, che non a bisogno di sotterfugi.<br>  il processo storico per arrivare al comunismo √® pi√π che mai in moto in questi anni, e la chiarezza di marx ci guida verso quel traguardo.<br>  <br>  la rivoluzione proletaria √® fallita a causa della contro rivoluzione.<br>  <br>  ossia, lenin non avendo compreso la necessit√† di formare un partito dialettico invece che democratico, al momento della presa del potere, il partito si era riempito di opportunisti, escludendo ( a causa del meccanismo democratico al suo interno) gli uomini fondatori del partito.<br>  quella fu la causa principale del fallimento della rivoluzione proletaria.<br>  tieni presente che il proletariato ha meno di 200 anni di storia, e ha gi√† dimostrato la strada da percorrere.<br>  se si paragonano i processi storici e sociali, si pu√≤ affermare che √® la classe in assoluto con le idee pi√π chiare.<br>  <br>  se per esempio si calcola che la borghesia per arrivare alla sua emancipazione ci ha messo 500 anni.<br>  (nasce come classe in italia nei borghi del 1200 e arriver√† alla sua rivoluzione alla fine del 1700).<br>  quindi di tempo ne abbiamo. :)<br>  <br>  ps : scusa per l'inizio della risposta, sono stato un fesso a non capire la tua domanda. pardon.<br>  <br>  @alex drugo: certo che se lo studiano eccome! io personalmente porto il mio giornale (marxista) a casa di un A.D. di una multinazionale, (lui fa finta di essere dalla nostra parte, ma √® ovvio il motivo per cui lo legge, come io leggo il sole 240re!)<br>  <br>  la borghesia studia affondo il marxismo, non a caso sono nati partiti socialdemocratici che avevano e hanno lo scopo di menare nell'alveo del parlamento gli interessi del proletariato, per poi stravolgere il senso delle richieste.<br>  <br>  i gesuiti in italia, dopo di noi, sono i migliori conoscitori del marxismo, la stessa cosa non si pu√≤ dire degli ex pci e derivati, quelli sono cresciuti all'ombra di stalin.<br>  che di marx conosceva solo la barba. (e le migliaia di statue che ha fatto mettere)...... (perch√® se uno si mette la spilla di marx sulla giacca, in italia viene considerato marxista. :) )<br>  <br>  a bientot.
