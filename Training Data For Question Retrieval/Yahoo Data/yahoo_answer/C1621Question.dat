20090227033334AA9pCDs	Travel;Africa & Middle East;South Africa	Volunteer work - South Africa - any ideas?	I'm a 24 South-African girl. This year I wanted to do something productive with my holiday.    I planned for the past year to go do some volunteer work at a Chimp sanctuary in the Congo. But with the political status this doesn't seem possible anymore.    Then I heard of a similar place in Namibia, But the costs they charge are very very high and way over my budget and then you still need to think about flights, medical expenses etc.         Then I heard of a place in South-Africa. I thought it will be cheaper. (less traveling costs) but to my disappointment they charge volunteers in dollars as well.....so obviously way over my South-Africa Rand budget again as soon as you convert it.      Does anybody know of any sanctuaries or conservation projects in South-Africa I can help with for about a month without needing to spend an arm and a leg.       Im a hands on person so don't really mind what they need help with.      Thanks

My fiance is in the army based in germany and moved over here to be with him. Now as far as i know that i dont need to do anything regarding living conditions but now confused as someone has told me that i can only stay here for 3 months maximum thats without registering as a german citizen however as i am applying for a job in the naafi on the army camp if i do that i will lose all my health insurance and wont be able to get the job if i register as a german citizen and as far as the job is concerned it could take up to 6 months before i actually start. im confused and want to know how long i can stay over here if it was classed as a holiday because registering as a german citizen will ruin my chances of getting a job on army base.    answers will be gratfully appreciated

20090305080401AAqTEAc	Travel;Air Travel	How can I calm my 3 year old on a 8 hour flight?	I am flying to Europe in may, it's a 8 hour long flight and my 3 year old son is coming along for the trip.   He is usually a very good child, he has his up and downs like we all do, but in general he is very respectful and listens very well to me.        I am worried about the whole ear popping thing, I am scared that he will be in pain and/or get some kind of ear infection from that, is that possible?  Also I know it's bad of me to suggest medicine use, but 8 hours is long and if he doesn't get rest, he will (believe me) turn into a different child.  Any suggestions that I can maybe give him something just in case he isn't falling asleep because I really do need him to rest at least a little, we are flying 8 hours to Germany and from Germany to Croatia for another 2 hours...and before ALL the flights we are taking a RobertQ bus for 4 hours to the airport, PLUS we have to arrive 3 hours early before departure time...so you see with a 3 year old I have  A LOT to handle.        Also, the Canadians here, do you know if I am allowed to bring toys on the plane?  Can we walk around for a minute or two to stretch our legs?       Thank you for taking the time to read this and please no stupid responses if you have nothing helpful to say please keep it to yourself.      Thank you again!

My uncle, who lives in Pinole (Bay area) has offered me a place to stay with him in Cali and I really want to go, but there are a few problems.  I don't have a job out there and I don't have alot of money saved to make it out there.  I work at a retail store selling cell phones, and I can't imagine having too hard of a time finding work.  It's just such a huge move and I guess it scares me a bit.  What do you think?  I live in New Hampshire, so it would be quite a jump.
