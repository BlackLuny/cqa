I had brown discharge, spotting over the weekend with no cramps, no pain.  I went to Dr. today and he said my cervix wasn't dilated, but that's where the old blood was from.  He sent me to ultrasound and the sac measured at 5 weeks instead of 7 and showed no fetus/hb.  Is it possible I'm just 5 weeks pregnant, or should I prepare for miscarriage?

20090309175604AAAwd6V	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	After 15 months of trying! Finally got my BFP!?	I can't believe it, but yet I can! I just felt different this month! I couldn't imagine myself not being pregnant. I'm gonna be a Mommy!    Well here is what i did different this month.   First of all, I always where tampson, well last period I wore pads, i dunno if that helped or not, but it might have helped clean me out!   Second thing I did was that Ibught and used the instead soft cups. They are for menstrual cycles, but help keep the little spermies close to the cervix!      My first sign: EXTREME moodiness, I mean, I was in a bad mood, it is not as bad right now, but I know it will come back.      2nd sign: I actually had implantation bleeding, last thursday the 5th. When I wiped I had some browninsh redish discharge, it then turned to pink and lasted two day! I though it was my period coming early because I always spot a couple days before my period, butit stopped.      3rd sign: I have had lots of cramping, and vry bad constipation! i have never been constipated before so i knew that was diiferent!         AF was not due till this Thusday the 12th, but i couldn't wait to test. it came up right away!      I am kinda worried cause I have had a false positive before, but it was with a digital test, and i looked and that test was know for false positives.      Thank you guys for all yu support, i have been trying for 15 months!   Baby dust to all!

20090309175916AAJxRsa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Are your twins almost completely separate people?	I have five year old twin girls they look exactly the same but one of them has black hair and the other has brown. Charlie and Samantha are almost completely separate though. Charlie likes really girly stuff and Samantha likes hot wheels and Charlie likes to have stuff put in her hair and she likes to wear skirts when if I dare put something in Samantha's hair I'd better get ready for a tantrum, Samantha likes blue jeans and hates dresses. The two are always together though. They are always putting Charlie's dolls in Samantha's toy trucks and stuff. If I try to separate them like when Samantha got mad and threw a fit I put her in time out and Charlie was sad that her twin wasn't near her. I know they are supposed to be different, duh. But they are completely different, hardly the same at all but yet they are.         How about your twins? Or twins you know. Or are you a twin?

20090309180411AAlghIm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Lingering cold symptoms for a 9 month old?	Hi. Tomorrow we have an appointment for my 9 month old, its her 9 month checkup and also about why shes been so congested for going on 4 weeks now. About 3 1/2 weeks ago, she had a fever and an ear infection. She was put on antibiotics and the day after she started them, the cold symptoms started (runny nose, congestion). The fever has been gone though. About 2 weeks after this started I called the pediatricians and they werent concerned, but when I called just last Thursday, the nurse was concerned that it hasnt gotten any better and said that we will just wait it out until tomorrow since it was only 4 days away at the time. If she would have gotten a fever at all, then to call and have her be seen. I guess that since its been almost a month of this, Im concerned myself. Im just wondering if anyone else has gone through this and what it was caused from. The pediatrician said that shes to young to have allergies, because that was my first thought.       Any advice would be appreciated! A little worried here.   Thanks!

20090309181217AAERrYP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Do I need a stroller to travel with 18 month old baby?	My husband, my mom, me and my (going to be at that time) 18 month old baby are traveling to mexico for a family vacation this summer. Multi-city trip with layovers. I have a big travel system stroller, but it is weighs almost 30 lbs and waaaay to bulky to travel by plane with it. I have my Ergo baby carrier which I use often for shorter trips. I was thinking to just take the Ergo and then have him walk or have my mom or husband hold him when my back needs a break. BUT do you think the summer mexico heat will be too unbearable w/ the Ergo? Also I will be about 22-24 weeks pregnant at the time, so depending on my size I may only do back carry. Do you think I should spend money on a new stroller just for this vacation? We will also be lugging around a big carseat so we are trying to downsize on stuff to take. If you suggest taking a stroller, any light stroller suggestions?

And I do have slight abdominal cramping.  My usual P.M.S signs are nada until I actually start AF, then I get the full blown cramps.      My HPT was negative today.      Also, my boobs have gotten larger, which is definitely apparent to me and my hubby.  They do not hurt though and I haven't noticed anything else.        My luteal phase is usually 11 days, making Thursday my expected AF.        I will test then, but out of your experiences, what do you think this sounds like?

20090309180349AANWxPo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Parents and my HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!?	Okay, I have hair that goes a couple inches below my shoulder, and bangs. My bangs were not cut long, but I decided to grow them out, so they go down to the bottom of my nose now if I pull them all the way down. I'm not gonna say they look really good, but the fact is, i'm growing them out, and if i pin it back it looks stupid and bulky, and if i use a headband, the hair actually sticks all the way up and looks VERY uneven. My mom has mentioned that I should get it cut before, and i blew her off, but today she EXPLODED at me at my bangs!!!!! She started screaming at me, and said that if i don't fix my hair or agree to get it cut, she will not take me to school tomorrow, and will enroll me at the public school. Let me explain this, I am NOT going to public school. I don't care if this is an empty threat, I AM NOT GOING BACK THERE! I may be somewhat depressed now, but it is gonna be a million times worse if I go back to a school system where nobody likes me, everyone mocks me, and nobody gives a ****. What should I do to calm my parents down. I haven't helped the situation by saying they should be locked up cuz it looks like their schizophrenics too, and i know why uncle gordy never talked to the family, i fought fire with fire and that didn't work. So, what should I say to them, because they are not being rational in any way shape or form, and because I am not changing my hair, because this is the only time I EVER get any comment on my hair?

Ok, so I'm 14, a freshman in highschool, I just got home to find out that my mom had thrown out 75% of my clothes because "you have too many things" When I walked in the door after getting home from track practice, i walked toward my room and opened the door . she was like "Don't get mad".. So then I yelled at her for going through my personal things inside of my room, she started ranting and screaming, like at the top of her lungs, it was quite scary from viewpoint. so then I said "why are you screaming?" and she pushed me down to the floor and started hitting me, hard, I still have very red marks in the spots.   Was I in the wrong or was she?   I have this hang-up about people respectin other's privacy, which I have made very obvious to her multiple times.   Also, is there something mentally wrong with her?   Whenever I am speaking to her, if i ask a question or say something like "so what do you think" her response is always "I tuned you out five minutes ago"   So is she crazy or just really bitchy      This is not the first time she's done this. Its probably like the seventh or eighth.   But she always starts screaming at me over nothing

20090309183345AAzecqD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Question about switching over to cloth diapers?	My boy is nearly 5 months now and we're thinking about switching over to cloth diapers. I bought 4 bumwears and we started using them at night because he has pretty bad diaper rash and we figured at night is when he has the longest contact with his diaper at once. So far, so good. But now I'm thinking of switching completely over to cloth diapers. The thing is, he goes through, on average, 12 diapers a day. He pees a lot! It's not really practical to have 20 bumwears (just the 4 cost us SGD$169) so we can use a set and have a set in the wash. So I was thinking of using pre-folds during the day instead. Has anyone done this? Or anyone else have a heavy wetter in cloth diapes? The owner of bumwear said she just changes ever 3-4 hours, but what if your bb wets more often than that? Any experience would help!

20090309183404AAua1mb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do I get my daughter to leave what's in her diaper, in her diaper?	My daughter is 17 months old and we have begun potty training.  For the past few days, she has begun to pull her poo out of her diaper and show it to us to tell us that she needs a diaper.  We've tried to put one-piece pajamas on her to discourage this, but she finds a way around it.        We do not leave her unsupervised.  Take tonight for example, she was right next to me as I was answering an email from my husband at work.  She reached in, took out a handful, and proudly showed it to me... in an instant.  I've had a cold for what seems like 3 weeks, so I can't always smell when she's odiferous right away!      She is hearing impaired, so don't say, "Yell at her when she does it!" and we have scolded her for it, as she communicates very well in sign language, and I am not going to spank her for it.  She knows the sign for "diaper" and uses it when she's wet and needs a change, and she uses the "potty" sign to tell us when she needs to go potty, but this thing with pulling her poo out of the diaper really has us baffled!         I don't know how else to stop this disgusting habit she has!  I'd love advice from anyone sincerely wanting to help!

I went to my doctor about 3 weeks ago and he told me I was around 6 weeks. Which would make me 9 weeks 2 days today.      Well I went to get an early ultrasound about 2 weeks ago at this other place and the technician told me I was a week behind that. According to my early ultrasound, I am 8 weeks 2 days.      I know when I ovulated and concieved and all that.      Dont they go from the first day of your last period?   (The first day of my last period was January 3rd)   If they do, wouldnt I be 9 weeks 2 days?      I agree with my doctor on his time. But what about the ultrasound? Could the baby just be measuring small?   I know your due date changes all the time, but what should I stick with?      Am I 8 weeks 2 days.   Or 9 weeks 2 days?      Please help

I don't think he needs so much formula since he is a very good baby food eater. I just give him cereal and vegetables and fruits, no puddings or sugary foods but he's still pretty chubby. The dr. still wants him to have at least 24 ounces of formula day. Is all this formula really necessary at that weight. I don't want him to be a fat baby.
20090309190053AAs2ykZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is standing up in the car, grounds for a spanking?	My three (almost 4) year old has figured out how to get unbuckled in the car. Yesterday was the first time that she did it and I stopped the car, put her back in the seat and gave her a good talking to. Today she was trying to do it again, and I told her that if she got up she was going to get a spanking. She did not listen, and got out of the seat about a block from the house.    I just took her in the house, and she was like "what are we doing mommy?" I told her she was getting a spanking, becasue she did not listen and she could be seriously hurt doing that. I took her inside and spanked her hiney fairly hard. She cried and I know it stung, but I would rather her bottom sting than have her flying through the wind shield or worse.    If your child did this would it be grounds for a spanking? I do not like to spank, but I do not want her seriously hurt

20090309185331AAdqXte	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	17 and 16 weeks pregnant, and  very confused and need  advice?	I have always had my life and future in perfect order. I love being organized and I have had a plan for the next 8 years of my life for a while now. I have always gotten good grades and I wanted to go to college right after high school and eventually get my bachelors, go to law school, and become a lawyer. Now that I am pregnant, I am very confused. I was just going to keep this plan, live with my boyfriend and child in my parent's house, and my boyfriend would go to trade school to become an electrician and we might be able to move out. I hate living at my parent's house, I cannot stand my parent's. I just want a house so bad, I wish that somehow we would be able to afford one, but I know this is going to take time. I honestly think that we would be struggling if we try and move out and possibly purchase a house with only my boyfriend's income. I have been thinking of just getting my bachelor's and try and get a career as a therapist, because I have always been interested in that too; but i've been wanting to be a lawyer ever since I was a small child. I would honestly only pick a career in psychology because I really want to get school over with so I can have a career and take care of my family. Although, if I do choose psychology, I will feel like I am bringing my standards down; but, I also do not want to pay for a HUGE college loan after I graduate. I am very confused and I honestly want to do what is best for my family. I am aware that you guys cannot solve my problems, but I just want a little bit of advice on what you think would be a good career path and what I should do to help my family.

I hate it when everyone just text and texts, and i feel really left out sometimes:/   But i dont want to wait till the 3rd trimester, which is the hardest to get straight a's and get a cellphone. I even asked if they could get a me a real cheap cellphone. they say no. they dont make sense. when people ask me for my phone number. i say i dont have one and they freak out which pisses me off. i seriously want a cellphone, how can i convince them.   seriously, our family is pretty wealthy too. :/

20090309195008AAgQcz0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How can i feel less nervous about starting high school?	last week, we had this presentation from the high school that i'll be attending next year, and it just got me thinking about it, and i realized that i'm terrified! i don't even know why. i know that once it starts it probably won't be as bad as i think, but what if it's worse? before i started middle school, i had all these ideas of what it was going to be like (mostly from movies), but for some reason i never really freaked out about it, probably because i was too distracted (it was my first year in this country). but now, i feel so anxious and nervous! i'm scared that it's going to be exactly like those tv shows, you know the "popular" crowd- the pressure, the sex.... i know it won't be that bad, but how can i make myself feel more comfortable about it? anyone have any personal stories? help please!

Well, throughout this pregnancy I've just been adding pillows. We currently have eight regular pillows and one body pillow. Two of the regular pillows are his, the rest are mine and yes, I actually use all of them. Two of them are for my head, the body pillow goes in front of me, one goes under my hips, another goes between my legs, and two go behind me when I take naps. If my honey is behind me, then I put the other two on the night stand.      So what about you? How many pillows are you using?

Yesterday, Matt was worried about something and he wouldn't tell me. Then finally he said, "Today, I might have gotten Kate pregnant." And I immediately asked if they used protection. But he said they didn't have sex.   WARNING: this part is very descriptive.   He said that she gave him a BJ and when the *** came out she took a breath and *** got on his finger. He washed it off, and a few minutes later he fingered her, but didn't put go in the hole because her cherry is not popped, and it would hurt. I am still a virgin so I don't know much about this stuff.    Could someone tell me if she might be pregnant? I'm worried about her. Matt told me he didn't want to be a dad yet, and I could tell in his voice he was really really terrified. Please help me...   thank you so much :)               P.S. no rude comments, please.

20090309195709AAr5iwN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Helping you kid pay for college: Good System?	Do you think this is a good system? Assuming you could afford it   However much money they put into it youll match. For instance, if they work really hard all summer and make about 3,000 dollars to go towards their college fund you would also put 3,000 dollars toward their fund. The rest of the bill will have to be paid by either scholarship or a loan.   That way your are helping them out but also not letting them get the easy way out. Then your also encouraging them to work harder, the more effort/money they put in the more you will and the less loans they will have to pay off after college?   Good system? Suggestions? Other systems that worked for you?      Also I feel like there should be some other "rules". Like not being on probation and keeping the GPA above a 2.5. Stuff like that.      What do you think?

Last time I had sex.. was around probably..the 16th or 23rd of january (for the life of me i cannot remember which friday it was). I KNOW what your thinking, shouldn't you have figured it out by now? Well here's the thing. my period has been on time EVERY time. But ive also heard stories of "you can have your period and be pregnant". But is that not called spotting? Cause i definately don't have that, it's a full out 4 day period. However, ive been getting headaches more recently (i work in a grocery store which may have something to do with it), i had some weird cramps today, i'm extremely fatigued (but i also stay up really late, say 2, 3 am sometimes). My stomach.. also looks really bloated and it will look fine one day and bloated the next, BUT if i lie down on my back my stomach is completely flat. So here's my question is it likely i am pregnant? And please don't tell me get a prego test I fully realize that but i'm not wasting 13,14 bucks if it's not likely that i am. Easy points to best, and most helpful answer!

Do you think that is to do with ovulation? I dont THINK it is normally sore when I go to the loo?

I feel so ugly it's unreal. I care too much about what people think about me. And I hate it. Don't tell me not to listen to them, and I shouldn't care about what they think.

20090309200116AAswJWD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My fiance is not interested in going to doc visit's w/me, or watching the baby be born....?	I just found out last week I am pregnant. We were talking about doc visits, and the birth, and he said that's just not him. He doesn't get excited about that. He is happy about the baby, but I think what it is is that he has a 13 year old, so he has done all this before, and it's not new to him. Well this is my first and I am very excited and nervous. Is it too unrealistic to ask him to go with me to every doc visit, and watch the birth of our baby. He says he will be in the room, but he will not look at it. He did make the comment he has done this before, and he didn't enjoy going to visits and such. It hurt my feelings b/c this is ours not his other child, and I want it to be special for me. What should I do or say. Am I overreacting?

20090309192727AAZ1fB3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My three month old has hardly eaten all day?	All day my son barely nursed (he is exclusively breastfed) but I thought I was imagining it or exaggerating it.      I left to go to class tonight and while I was gone he refused to take a bottle (he ALWAYS takes a bottle) of expressed milk or formula.   He was VERY fussy.      I came home right away and he nursed a little bit.      His temperature is 99.7.   His eyes are kind of glossy and the whites of his eyes are greyish.      He hasn't had very many wet diapers, and it's only a little bit of urine.      But he seems to be eating more since I got home.      Instead of an answering service my ped's office refers you to "pediatric urgecare" and I called and spoke to one of the nurses and they said he should go to the ER if he's not eating to get hydrated.      But as soon as I got off the phone with her he ate.      What would you do?   He's eating now
20090309201008AAO4pyQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Nausea & Frequent Urination in Women?	Hi. The past couple days have been a little aggravating. Im not sure if this is hormone related as I am suppose to start my period on Thursday (3/12). I am getting a little nauseous after eating and actually threw up last night after dinner. This afternoon I ate some rice for lunch and felt queasy but no trip to the restroom. My main thing is the constant urination! It is ONLY early afternoon/evening and NOT in the middle of the night. I am not getting up to go any more than I normally do (which is once- if that) but from around 4ish to 10pm, its almost every 20 minutes. It does not hurt or burn in any way and it is not just a dribble. I go a decent amount each time. I have noticed over the months that the week or two before my period has been so different and I experience symptons that are pretty new. Im just wondering if anyone can relate to this or if there is someone out there that thinks they could give some advice. Im wondering if its a pms thing, sign of pregnancy (I have a 17 month but every pregnancy is different) or as much as I dont want to think this but, diabetic or some other medical issue.   Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read and would love to hear responses.

I know the chances are slim, but are there any success stories out there?  I can still feel my belly stretching and I have no cramping or spotting.  I will be going back on Fri. the 20th for a follow up u/s.  I was just hoping someone out there could give me a little hope.

20070417003324AAUdJrR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Dr. Appointments at 35 weeks and NST?	I have been going for Non Stress Fetal Monitoring for the past 5 weeks.  I am 35 weeks and 4 days, when I went to my weekly OB appointment yesterday she told me that I no longer needed to come in to see her weekly. That I was just to go for the Non Stress Fetal Monitoring in the labor and delivery each week.  She checked my cervix and it is still closed.  She told me 2 weeks ago, that I should have an ultrasound done at 36 weeks, but changed her mind yesterday.      I am considered high risk due to pre-existing diabetes, which I have been controlling very well.  I have been having severe swellling in my feet, but my BP is very good.    Is this normal for an OB to tell a patient to just go for the NST's and not see her?  I am concerned.  I should mention the fact that her brother who is her office manager was our family Dr. manager too, and they had a falling out recently and is no longer fam. dr. manager.  Since then I feel as though my treatment has been significantly altered.

I was just wondering...and kinda just for fun.   I have wavy brown hair (used to be blond when I was a kid) my husband has black curly hair. We both have brown eyes. He's 6ft 1 and i'm 5ft 7.    Are talents and interests hereditary? Example I can draw...and he can write.    Do you think the baby will be black haired brown eyed and tall? or is there a chance that he may have blue eyes or blond hair...    (there are blue eyed people in our families) 
20081020075935AAIHv66	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do you give your toddlers milk?	This question might sound a little daft but here goes anyway.      SInce I stopped breastfeeding my daughter at around age 13 months, i havent given her milk to drink.  She used to eat yoghurt every day and cheese, and of course whe would a large portion of milk with her cereal every day, so the health visitor didnt make a fuss.  These days however she has less yoghurt although she still has a milky cereal (usually porridge).      I have never given her milk to drink on its own.  How do people usually drink milk - warm or cold?  Just normal fresh milk in a glass? If I have no fresh milk, will long life milk do?  Semi-skimmed or full fat?      She is almost 3 now.

Now at 35 weeks i feel dizzy sometimes, my feet and hands  swelll up and quickly go back down and my head hurts. i see sparks flying, but sometimes the BP is low, sometimes its high. at the doctors its always normal though, what should i do?

What would have happend? would she have gone into labor? whats a D&C? Would the baby have been developed, how big?

20081001100524AAHiaJm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do you deal with unwanted baby raising "advice" from your mom?	Lately my mom has been very opinionated about the way I am raising my son. For example:   -he wakes up at night occasionally.  My hubby gets up and gets him to sleep in less than 10 mins (it take me 2+ hours b/c baby wants to eat).  Mom thinks i should be making him cry it out.   -baby cries when I pour water on his head in the bath.  Mom says it is because I was too gentle on him when he was little       It makes me feel like like a totally crappy mother and I don't think I am doing a horrible job!  I do feel bad that my husband has to get up with the baby at night, but we have talked about it and have made our own decision.      I talk to my mom a lot and just don't know what to do about this "advice".  It doesn't seem to matter what I say (I ave explained my position about cry it out several times)...she keeps commenting on these two issues.  What would you do in this situation?

20081102145909AA2G8rH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Young, Pregnant, Scared & Unsure...?	I am 20 years old & unsure of everything concerning this pregnancy. I was on the pill, but things happen. I'm not sure of what to do. I am educated on both sides (abortion & having him/her) but I was wondering if there are other young ladies out there that have been in my position and would like to know about their experiences. This decision is stressing me out as I can see the pros and cons of both choices, yet I am still totally unsure of which route to take.

Well how would you feel about your 15 year old daughter going to her boyfriends house? I mean my mom has met him.      His mom would be there too, and probably his 3 sisters that still live there. He is very nice and it is not like we would do anything bad.      I am just afraid to ask my mom, so I thought I would see other parents views on this first. Thank you :)
20081109144345AA6aaDw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Just found out i'm pregnant with baby number 2 :)?	So 2 days ago i took a CB test and it came out positive. I made a doctors appt. just to make sure, and sure enough i am pregnant! Surprisingly i'm already about 8 weeks along (last pregnancy i had a little feeling at around 5 weeks). I'm pretty nervous and excited at the same time. But i can't wait to have another baby in the house and to experience all the joys of pregnancy again!! I know i'm not asking a question, so i'll ask a few questions to all you pregnant women out there :)   1. Are you pregnant, if so how far along are you?      2. Do you have any other kids, if so how many and how old?      3. How is your pregnancy coming along, do you know what you're having?      4. Is your spouse/S.O excited for the new arrival? Are your other kids excited?

20081110161554AARudIl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	He keeps calling! Am I wrong to not want to pick up?	So there's this really annoying guy who has been calling me SO much since last year.   I know he likes me and all that, but he calls for no apparent reason!       Examples:      1. Once he called late at night (11-ish) saying that he wants to "hear my voice".      2. Asks "Whats the homework?" and before I respond he says all the homework we got (we are both in the same honor classes). Then he's like, okay bye. But all I said was HELLO!      3. Recently, he has called twice to find out who I "might like". I tell him that it's none of his business, but he keeps trying to make me tell him. Then he's like "Does he have an N in his name?" And then I say yes. He says "Yes!!!" (His name is Nathan, so he got all excited). But I DON'T like him.      4. He's afraid to call my house phone. I've had a few "incidents" through the phone, and my parents usually want to know who I'm talking to. Plus, I'm always far from the house phone, so I barely pick it up. Then he calls me on my cell phone. And he keeps CALLING AND CALLING! Once I pick it up, he's always blabbing about something. I tell him to call my house phone, and he doesn't seem to care.      5. I see him everyday! Not even my best friends call me as much as he does!       Sorry for that long list...But he just called a few minutes ago, and I didn't pick up. Is it wrong for me not to pick up? I mean, it's getting annoying!       Has this happened to you? I don't want to be mean...but do you think it is necessary for me to be mean to him, just to get him to leave me alone?   I have a HUGE conscience, so I tend to feel bad for the littlest reasons..   x

20081107122706AAd3kEr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Im starting to get really worried,what should I do?(it's a bit long,read if you don't mind)?	    So one of my oldest and closet friends is basically destroying her life,I understand it's her life and she can do what she wants but im one of her best friends I have every right to start getting worried about this.Anyways,she does pot and she started having sex 4 months ago with 4 different guys.Im really worried and I don't know what to do with her,I've tried to encourage her to want to do good in school get off the drugs and stop having sex before she does something she'll regret big time.What finally trigged this is what happened yesterday.She calls me during lunch and she wasn't there(last thing I knew is she was smoking) so she says "dude I need you to bail me out" and I asked whats happening and she tells me she got caught by the cops with weed(alot too) and she was put in the detention center,she got suspended from school for 10 days,and I told her,yesterday that if she keeps this up something really bad's gonna happen soon(and I was right,I swear im ALWAYS right and nobody listents to me),I got my brother to take me down to the detention center and I picked her up,and took her home,I've done ALOT of favors for this girl,I've bailed her from situations that could've gotten her into juvie,i've gotten her out of suspension and expoltion,and now I gotta try and bail her from this.I don't know what to do,she said after this she's qutting for good,I said told her she says it everytime and it never happens,3 days later she'll be back to smoking and it's not good.She's doing very poorly in school,she got her report card a few days ago and she got 1 B and it was in something called Intensive Reading,and everything else were D's and F's.I told her she's gonna get held back and she told me she'll pass and not to worry but I know she's gonna be held back,and i've tried to help her get on a good track to stop smoking and to go to school and get good grades but she laughs at me about it.       Also with the sex she's 14,and she had sex for the first time in August,and I remember all she ever told me was "Never ever ever in my next 4 years of school will I have sex,it's stupid and im not gonna risk getting pregnant" and 3 weeks into school rumor has it my best friend is the new school slut,She was drunk and high and she had no idea who the guy was,then she told me she was never gonna have sex again and then she did once again,she was drunk and high and 2 more times she did it expect the last time she did it she wasn't drunk but I know she was still stoned.With every guy she had sex with not 1 did she use a condom and she wasn't on the pill.She had 2 pregnency scares and she's been lucky both times.This girl is my best friend and I love her to death but all this is getting to be to much,i've been doing my best to help her out but she just keeps doing everything thats hurting her and she won't change her ways.I understand I can't force her but what else can I do to get her to quit the pot stop the sex and just shape up so she's not a failure?     She doesn't come from the greatest family either.Divorced parents,always getting kicked out of her dads house,not being able to stay at her moms because there isn't enough room.Her mom never knows what the hell she's up to and her dad doesn't care,he just tells her do whatever she wants because he has no idea what to do with her.So it's also why she's doing all this,her sisters and brother smoke but not as much as her(they've all done it maybe a few times but thats it),2 are in highschool and 2 in college and they all are very high achivers.They've tried to help her but she gets pissed and goes off and does these things so it's really hard to get threw to her.   Im the only friend she has that will bail her from her sticky situations,and she never appreciates what I do,I help her she promises to not do those things again and then she's back to it,and im to nice to stop doing all this.I don't know.Should I cut off our 7 year friendship? or put this aside and just keep being there for her?
20081027124458AAht55w	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why do people ask these questions on YA: Am I pregnant? Am I having a miscarriage? ?	I know how it feels just to want other people's opinions, thoughts and support but how come so many people are coming out asking questions like "Am I pregnant"? We can't answer that question. Don't they know that they need to take a test or see a doctor? Oh, and what really gets me is the "Am I having a miscarriage". You would think that if a pregnant woman is cramping and bleeding badly that they would immediately go to the doctor. I'm really not trying to be rude, just curious.

She will start saying I was copying her by having sex for a baby but thats not the case people have sex because they want to or are trying to have a baby plane and simple really... I recently moved back in with my bf and his dad due to problems with my family... My father has began to drink more again and tends to get physically abusive when upset and my mom and I have come to terms now that are different then before so their is more trust and everything between us however I couldn't live with my father for obvious reasons and my mother invited a guy who abuses her back into her home along with his son to live there because of finacial situations... so I would have no room to live there...       ...I found out I could be pregnant and its beginning to look more and more that way. Joe (the father of the baby) said if I am then I am. I can always get help from WIC and my mother has offered to help me along with my remaining friends. However my father isn't speaking to me and neither is my entire dads side of the family because they found out I was bi-sexual on myspace which I think is stupid because I am with a guy... also my moms side of the family doesn't speak with her because the are racist bastards so I am limited of family but oh well...  How would I go about telling my father and dads side of the family along with joes father? He drives truck so he isn't always there but I know one thing for sure.. I am not giving the baby up for adoption and I am never going to get an abortion... I helped make this baby and I am going to keep it and give it everything it needs and the love and affection it deserves...

20081113070638AAUvX2h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Do you think he'll ever bo back?	So, I'm 8 months pregnant... My bf left me about 2 weeks ago and said that he needed time to think and clear his head... Soon after he started talking to his ex... He says they still have feelings for each other and they are just going to take it slow... He says he just doesn't love me anymore... We're having a baby in a month and I have so much to do as far as preparation goes... I have to beg him to help me with things, and then the whole time he keeps looking at his clock and says he's gotta go... We've been having sex the whole time but he doesn't want her to find out... She hates me btw, now she's telling people that they are going to fight for custody... What should I do... I just thought he wanted his space... Why would he go back to a B**** like her... I just don't understand... I want him back but I don't know what I should be doing now... He gets mad at me when I text and call him all day but I just can't seem to let him go when I know he's talking to her...

20081118220935AAjbMIx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am i pregnant? Are these symptoms pregnancy? when's the earliest i can test?	My last period began on Oct 26th and lasted until Oct 30th however the last two days(Oct 30 and Oct 31) my bf and i had unprotected sex. Since then we have has sex on Nov 4, Nov 5. Nov 8, Nov 11, Nov 16 and today Nov 17, each time we usually went more than once and haven`t used protection.(we also had sex from the 21st-25 of Oct) My cycle is usually 29-30 days.      Starting around Oct 12th i`was able to get no sleep, my stomach ached(not like cramps just pain)and i felt nauseous. Last night(Oct 16) i had little sleep due to a headache, this morning and all day my headache has been coming and going and i`ve felt nauseous on and off as well as having Minor tender breasts.`Oh and last night after having sex i went to the washroom and when i wiped there was a little light pink bloody fluid, i assumed it was my period but than today there was nothing, my bf also said he had blood on his member.      Now im left to wonder whats going on, my bf says im sick but i know that's not how i feel. Please help, im wondering when i can take a test and get a accurate result or what these symptoms could mean and what i should do next!      I would really appreciate some advice but please nothing rude or uncalled for or comments on mine and bf decision on the unsafe sex.         After last night my bf, said he had a little bit of blood on his member. i never had any when peeing though, is this still spotting?? I also have had lower back pain today, nothing severe just minor coming and going. I was also wondering when is the earlyest i can test and how many tests i should take. One more question (sorry i have so many) can i take tylenol or anything?? and will having a hottub decrease my chances of being pregnant?      Thank you guys so much for the advice its really great to hear from people who have been there please keep its coming =)
