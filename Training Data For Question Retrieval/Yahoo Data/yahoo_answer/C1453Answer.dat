c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	well, actually, my man and i just had a build-a-bear date night together.  it was a lot of fun!  my feelings are that build-a-bear is really expensive and, to the receivee, is still JUST a teddy bear.  if he helps pick out the animal and attire, it might mean more and will give you a neat activity to do on v-day :)    i just made a rock n' roll monkey with a guitar!|`|N4YfKm7qaa	If it's saying 'I love you' in your voice, definitely dress it as a girl! That way he'll always think of you when he looks at it.|`|V411tuPyaa	Give him the bear with nothing on ... you or the bear.  He will remember it forever!!|`|GZVTLPwuaa	A girl if you are having it say "I love you"    Cute idea :)|`|vQmO3N6Raa	That's kind of corny....but if he's that kind of guy i would make it a girl.|`|gdv1VclJaa	It doesn't matter.. It is a very good (excellent) present, no matter what gender is the bear.. He will love it..|`|eQxIB4Rdaa	He's 17 you idiot.  He doesn't want a stupid teddy bear he wants sex and blow jobs and porn.  Porn is nice and you should buy him lots of it.
GEqyvwXAaa	there are several online BDSM singles/swingers dating sites. i've only been on bdsmsingles.com, which was okay, although a bit sketchy - lots of 60 year old married couples asking if i wanted to visit them on spring break. i'm actually having much better luck on okcupid. okcupid is a free dating site, but they make your profile very personal so you can find better matches (through lots of questions that you can take at any time and a whole bunch of math i don't understand), and it tends to attract more of an alt-sex crowd than most sites. i've already had more interested parties than i could shake a stick at - or rather, than could shake sticks at me :-) but you can also make clear that you're just looking for people to hang out with.  Happy hunting!|`|hXQnR2Scaa	This is really the wrong place to ask this, IMO.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	I don't know a lot about that freaky stuff...I have no idea what a switch is...but you like to be submissive? That's kinda strange. I would hate to sleep with a guy like that...lol.|`|ZR2iH33Maa	I found a site once while using Google. I don't remember the title so Google BDSM communties and see what you come up with.    I have a boyfriend whom I wheedled into being a bit of a Dom. So maybe you could turn someone over to BDSM.

You paid the manufacturers price if you paid wholesale.|`|AA10045620	Cheapest one I see is $69.95, but if authentic, a fabulous price.|`|IVy35SE2aa	Ellen, you must be very rich.  I read that the Chinese make them   for 93 cents in southern China and 98 cents up north.  That is  before the logo goes on.  some of the surrounding countries charge up to .25 cents more to make them.
Q41oT372aa	I kind of know what you are talking about. I am a goth in college and there are two other goth girls in my class. One of them talked to me and we became great friends right away but the other girl ignores us both. Some goths do just tend to be a little anti-social especially if they think you are a poser when really they are the poser.|`|h1HyWqqeaa	talk to her & ask her why she acts the way she acts|`|ZR2iH33Maa	Obviously she's not a true Goth. She's one of those little posers who thinks being Goth is all about hatred and death.  People like that make Goths all look bad. Try to avoid her as much as possible and you'll be better off for it.
lqXxUJrDaa	Use estn  Estar is used for impermanent things, states, locations, etc.|`|Q8JeA1eNaa	I would use Ser or son.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	it would be estan b/c estar is used for conditions =)|`|AA11598520	The way I remember it is "ser" is for more permanent things and "estar" is for things that change.|`|DC4Civrvaa	It this case it would be "estan".  The verb "estar" is used for a temporary situation like a feeling or being in a place.  The verb "ser" is used for something of more of a permanent nature like a personality.  Hope this helps.  Good luck on your Spanish!|`|gyhVnBN9aa	Estan  "Los alumnos Estan ausentes."
hYqRhQxPaa	well i am indian sweetheart....why racist comment  you can't judge people by their skin  we are just like others|`|WNWKDw4uaa	I don't have a strong opinion one way or the other.  Do you mean Native Americans or East Indians?|`|c6HfikOHaa	i think that indian people are the same as any one else ans actually think some of the indian woman are really beautiful|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	I judge a person by the content of their character, not by their nationality, ethnic, religion, race or skin colour.|`|4BppP7Mkaa	I have an indian friend. I don't discriminate.|`|h1HyWqqeaa	they are nice people|`|jvLsrtBNaa	i like their shoes|`|420b488758fd919f03fd6da33dbabf9baa	They look like anyone else to me im color blind (not really but you know lol) The women are really beautiful to|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	I work in a company with ALOT of Indians who are here from India on project work. They're mostly engineers. Some are nice and cordial when I walk by them and some just wont even look me in the eyes. I try to shake it off like its a cultural thing to not look a woman in the eyes. It does ps me off sometimes though. Then we have this one, who was raised in New Orleans, he speaks just like an educated Brotha and I think he's awesome. lol|`|zCjzu5claa	no, I dont think they are dirty, just the ones who are terrorists but not the ones that are in America just for a living like anyone else.|`|oa1RheExaa	agree to asker  star

c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	in a new relationship it might be hard to talk about going all out for V-day.  He's probably having the same dilemma you are.  plan on getting him something thoughtful, but not extravagent, and either have an idea plan (in case he asks what you want to do) or make plans to have a date night in and cook/watch a movie, etc.  if he gets you something, great...if he doesn't, don't be offended, as you just started dating and he might not want to send a wrong message|`|DBF3jL3vaa	well i think you should at least mention it before you start to make plans. maybe ask him to be your valentine :) then take it from there. i would say maybe dinner and a movie, thats what me & my baby are doing. teddy bears are cute 2! hope i helped!
912184e16e910db90a6979b2d6ebeeb9aa	For me, it was curiosity. There was no peer pressure or a need to break rules. My friends passed around joints and I declined a few times. One day I though "what the hell?" and took a hit. It was actually kind of fun. But, I've never been a pot head or have been addicted to anything. That's when the problems arise.|`|98XExOmqaa	social drug use is not the problem. habitual drug use is and that can happen at any age. i think social drug use is common among young people but i would say more like 13 to 30. they start younger now.|`|mnEkv7xdaa	People tend to imitate those around them in order to fit in and feel accepted. Weak minded people (often young) sometimes don't set standards for themselves, and end up doing things that will cost them physically and emotionally in order to fit in.
J3TRJPIwaa	I think flowers are a great idea. There is a code I saw "SOCIAL" for a discount I can't remember which company though so I would at least try it with whoever you order through - you might save some money.|`|c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	if there is any way you could get to the flowers before they are delivered (like if you go to the shop instead of ordering online) you could tie little notes to each flower...they could be little thoughts/quotes, coupons, whatever.  or they could have 'i love you' in 12 different languages.    personally, i think plain roses are..well, plain.  i like the rose/lily mix|`|cWd3BPWMaa	Find out her favorite flower.    And I really like the answer about the 12 different ways to say I love you, in a different language on each flower.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	hilarious name, by the way.    a dozen red roses is classic and not simple. it's very sweet and romantic. If you are looking for something else though, I would go with a box of chocolates rather than more flowers.|`|DBF3jL3vaa	well you should do something that is significant, like each flower mean something different on the relationship and by different color, maybe? but if not, a dozen of roses are GREAT!!

Leda2ha0aa	If she is the manager then she should be leading by example.  How can she expect you to be professional when she is not doing it herself?  If there is someone above her in your place of employment, then you could talk to them if she really gets out of hand with reprimanding you and co-workers.  I would not stoop to her level and act like a fool while working, but I would not let her get away with it (especially if someone is groping her - imagine if they did that to a person who would be offended.  Sexual harassment charges was be brought up).|`|REC4YgOuaa	If your company is crappy and doesn't have a system in place for reporting sexual harassment, time to find another job.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	There's a distinction here between manners and responsibility. The "miss manners" response is to mind your own business.    However this is the workplace, and her actions are unethical. I assume she is not the highest level boss in this place. I think you should talk to her superior - the store manager or area manager, or whoever that would be. If you are not comfortable with it, you could write an anonymous letter to the supervisor.    If you write a letter, be sure to keep it factual. Don't make it sensational, or draw your own conclusions, or that sort of thing. Just state the facts of what specifically you have seen happening, and how it makes you feel while you are at work.|`|aIHSmRYwaa	quit your job!|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	The forum is about manners.    So I offer a polite reply:    Its not really your business.   I suggest you ignore it, and just do your work.  She is your boss.  I also suggest you avoid gossiping about it.    Manners are about what you can control...and that's your behavior, not theirs.|`|WuhIoS1laa	A more ethical company would classify that as sexual harassment. Just because you aren't the one in the relationship doesn't mean it isn't. Your manager is carrying on with a subordinate in a way that would get anyone else in trouble.

I don't know what region you reside in, but if you happen to live near Dallas or the DFW Metroplex, then you may be interested in the COUPLES-MASSAGE CLASS which is taught at Sterling Health Center Massage School every year.    It is a six (6) hour course on that Saturday from 10am-4pm and by the end of the day, all couples should feel comfortable giving a full-hor massage like a pro and without injuring themselves or getting tired!    Its such a fun class and very popular with the Dallas locals who know!  But if you dont live in Dallas, its still worth the search to find a similar class nearby that teaches couples or pairs (such as mother/daughter, etc) how to give a good massage.     Basically, during half of the class you will be massaging your partner and during the other half, yout parner will be massaging you.  It is a unique gift that everybody loves and you can bet that anyone receiving the gift will never forget it!    For anyone interested in enrolling in the Couples Massage Class in Dallas, they can either logon to http://www.sterlinghealthcenter.com or http://www.sterlingdayspa.com or call the massage school directly at +1(972)991-9292 .    I hope this helps! Good luck and Happy Valentines Day to you in advance!
DR4LYQBtaa	Actually Heather, she is not stereotyping.     I know what you mean by your question though. I don't think -ism is correct and at this moment, I'm not sure what the right phrase is.  I can't think of any of what you're talking about right now either but I just wanted to let you know that Heather is wrong and you are not being stereotypical about anything!!! :)|`|rUgC7SPsaa	They are called stereotypes.  From what I hear, Northerners are aholes who love chowder.  :)  See, just a harmless little stereotype.    EDIT: "Southern-isms: Saying; "yall" and "dang," a love for grits, and putting butter on mostly everything."  And this is true of Southerners?  Really?      I didn't accuse you of being stereotypical, or loving clam chowder or being an ahole...  I'm simply saying that to lump people intoa  group (-isms, as you call them.  i.e. racism, ageism, sexism, etc), then you are, by definition, stereotyping.  Look it up.    EDIT:  Whatever, Little Girls.  Read a book.  Emily, then why don't you actually answer the question....???

n560blqraa	Racial factors are seemingly becoming less important to people as we become more educated, less ignorant, and perhaps more tolerant of change. I think people have realized that success in love and partnerships can be found outside of their own race and religion, some are successful some are not. Either way, it becomes about the right to choose for ones self without being ostracized by society, leading to more people dating outside their own race due to society being more accepting of it.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Because they think Black men are cool.

stBzl9Nfaa	??????? >> Arabic.|`|GtazNrplaa	We write it the same in Australia. No help there from me.|`|kidXtmYgaa	Here in Italy we write it : GIORGINA. The pronounciation is the same....  Even if Giorgina is a diminutive of the most used GIORGIA (Jorr-jah)|`|AA11998997	In Spanish it is the same GEORGINA..:  Happy weekend!  Tula
eTx3Nfd7aa	its a clear case of do as i say not as i do yes some parents do swear myself included although i wish i didn't sometimes but kids need to know that just because adults use swear words they don't want to hear it coming out of the mouths of their children im 38 and swear like a trooper but i hate it when it slips out in front of my mum or dad.it just does not feel right.|`|FcZU29W6aa	They are adults and can decide what type of language they will use and what type of language they will allow their children to use.    When you are on you own and paying all of your own bills, then you get to decide.  In the meantime, they are trying to raise children who will become responsible, productive adults -- it's not an easy job, and you should appreciate their efforts.  Just think about all the parents who don't give a darn about their kids.  You are very, very lucky.|`|zdu3gh8jaa	I don't swear in general at all. I also raised my children to speak to me and treat me in the same manner as they feel I am speaking to or treating them. They are now adults and I have never had an issue with their use of language or anything else really.I am not daft enough to think that they have never sworn, nor that they don't now, just that they understand that there is a time and a place for everything and general day to day conversations,around young childrens, the elderly and anyone else that mey be offended is neither the time nor the place. I have always believed that I should not expect my children to behave in a certain manner or refrain from doing something if I can't set them a consistent example of the behaviour that I do expect. It seems to have worked well for me. I have utmost respect for them and they do for me - it works both ways and it works well.    I hope this helps.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	Because they earned the right. They may not enjoy the way they speak, but every parent is expected to pass on better traits to their children.|`|pN0EOoepaa	its the classic..do I say not as I do.    There adults, you are not.|`|272b4b9f1dbb02370331a991e15d7432aa	I don't know. That's why parents seem so weird! It's not like sex or something. Kids should be able to curse to if grown ups can, but I guess it seems uncouth to adults.|`|758cae615235590fa29ef1d7060ba6d7aa	Yes, they should lead by example.|`|mnEkv7xdaa	Because they pay the bloody bills, dammit!|`|dadbf491299b240fa671de983330e8fcaa	Yep, that's what being an adult and a parent is all about.    There is an expression that comes to mind and was spouted at me by my parents when I questioned them re the same thing.    Do as I say, Not as I do|`|C7Vn3T7Aaa	It's NOT okay for them to swear, especially in front of their children.  I don't in normal conversation, and I expect my kids to keep a clean mouth too.      There is an old saying that says swearing 'neither lends force to the argument or dignity to the user'.    Sometimes, it's the only way to let someone know how really, really mad you are, but if you use swearing all the time, it takes away it's impact.      Rise above this, and try to limit the amount of swearing you do.  It mustn't become a habit, as it makes people judge you before they know anything about you, and that judgement won't be good.    You're right, it is a double standard, but one you will have to live with for the time being.|`|R6lxaKiEaa	Because they brought you in and they can take you out!  You're the kid and they're the Parents|`|F5lCFvqeaa	You're right.  If parents don't want their kids to swear, they should lead by example.|`|c6g92RRVaa	probably similar reasons to why you shouldn't have sex or drink even though they do. they might be being dramatic by shouting at you but i guess you need to learn respect because you can't go round swearing at everyone it is unpleasant especially for children to be swearing|`|0m7kEIDiaa	.. and why do their kids say , "I'm not a kid anymore " just before they ask what's for tea and where is their clean shirt and can they get a lift to, and could they have some money for... :)    It's a topsy turvy world .|`|mJSZJgkCaa	My mum & dad never swear in front of me, although I have heard them when they thought I wasn't listening. If you don't want your children to swear in front of you, don't swear in front of them I say.|`|P0jxi2Huaa	You use the word bloody too much. A little on the unimaginative side me thinks. I don't think all parents are like that, but if it offends your parents when you use that sort of language, it is rude of you to carry on using it. To even up the playing field, suggest that they don't swear in front of you either.
cPQ7TBcuaa	I don't expect any "race" to be fat... But a size 0? I would hate to be that small...I like my curves though...I am a size 9/10 and I am totally happy with it. You should just set a goal to lose weight and then stop dieting when you get happy with your size...you probably won't want to go all the way down to 0, that would be so hard to do!|`|2RzEaod9aa	"The hard part to becoming a zero is portions."  That's right. Unless you have a very small bone structure and are very short, being a size zero is all about portions...as in, malnourishment. A size 0 shouldn't be your goal...in fact, no particular size should. A healthy body and healthy life are lifestyles, not dress sizes or weights.    "But its better then being obese and I always wanted to feel small."  Uh, what, you have only two choices...be obese or be a size zero? No. And you only want to feel small because you're insecure and you want to look as insignificant as you feel.|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	Its absurd to think that anyone's race in particular is expected to be fat.  In some cultures, the types of food eaten can play a part in why one particular culture appears 'curvier' or 'healthier' than the next.  (Disclaimer-I use the aforementioned terms very loosely here.).  Being overweight is never a healthy lifestyle especially if your a person of color as you are prone to diabetes & heart disease.|`|wTqid2ONaa	There's a difference between "fat" and "obese".    Fat is something people call other people to feel better about themselves.    Obese is when you're too big for health reasons.    I think size 0 is too small, i didn't even know there was a 00 that must just look like bones.  I like my women like i like my chicken :P|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Good for you, work on that to get down to a 180 at least. If no one was obsessed like the people on biggest loser, there would be no progress and no weight loss. No pain no gain.|`|6ac013da2dceabac6383ebdee4f828c0aa	A size 0 is rarely attractive--on anyone.  Most men like a woman with some curves on her.  Since you are 5'10", at a size 0, you'd probably scare the crap out of people.    I'm 5'4" and I'd look sick as a 0.  I'm a size 6--it is small, yet I still have my curves.    A size 12 is a much more realistic goal for you...maybe a size 10.  You'll be slim and still look like a woman, instead of a malnourished freak.|`|UnG3dS7xaa	You don't have the same body you did before middle school "ruined" you, so your logic is flawed. Being a size 0 is not healthy for a majority of women. I think you have an unhealthy view of yourself and I recommend you see a dietitian or at least talk to your doctor about what you are doing.|`|QgzTdZ2uaa	I think you seem to have a real obsession about weight and clothes size that is unhealthy spiritually and you should think about focusing on just being healthy, in life, what size you wear will not be the thing that makes you happy and satisfied. Just my opinion, good luck in your effort to lose weight and get healthy.|`|21nl48mbaa	I applaud your desire to lose weight and become a healthy person, but a size 0 is unrealistic for 99.9999999% of the population.  People have a lot of different body types and there are many beautiful women who don't fit the "model ideal".  Truth be told most men aren't attracted to stick thin girls.  I prefer some "junk in the trunk" myself.

Thats all I can say =]|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	You are such a minority though. Be happy|`|adL8Qm7yaa	history shows that nobody in america likes us cuz we're too successful, shown by the Chinese exlusion act in 1880s and the National Origins act in 1921, which exluded all east asians..  cuz apparantly we're taking over white ppl's job.    its still goin on nowadays sooo deep down, lots of white americans still dont really like us.    But as for looks, ppl jst like to think our eyes as small despite it being the same freakin size as every1 else. its jst the shape that makes it SEEMs small.  all white ppl have double eyeleds too.    most asian girls r short sooo that make sense.    idc bout ur butt    and its a good thing we're smart. we'll freakin take over the world.    its all jealousy at work here.|`|14f43f349bb66eb9fca9c31edef61771aa	girl the stuff bitching about is nothing compare to what others races deal with on daily routine.|`|Im9cwUIyaa	Almost every Asian I've met fits the description of your list.

gkoX68Awaa	Practice makes perfect. Try tying a knot in a cherry stem inside your mouth a few times, once your able to do that your kissing will improve a hundred fold.|`|sOeDTrPeaa	just out your lips together and enjoy. move your lips, sometimes suck, no need for tongue all the time only for a slow romantic kiss. take it slow, unless it's leading to um you know|`|WDbE5gffaa	You shouldn't really be sucking on his lips!  Just putting them together and moving your tongue against his slowly. Mix things up a bit too :) Maybe sucks sometimes, but not the whole time :P|`|VAsHqPNJaa	Funny who the poster above is in this section to begin with. Ignore it though...    Truthfully, there's no "right" way to kiss, everyone develops their own rhythm and way of kissing so don't go crazy about it. If it feels right to you then do it, if you feel weird or wrong than ask him, and if he's fine with it then keep doing it... But yeah, refrain from the sucking... Just, good luck! =D

BUT the stupid ladies who think they are better than everyone else because they are pretty or whatever, need to stop, and stop now because they are all stuck up whores|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Its hilarious to me and so obvious at times. Do you watch the Bad Girls Club? Classic example there. First it was the big boobed brunett hair girl who was use to getting attention and the blond girl came in and stole her spotlight supposedly. Then now they have a new big boobed brunett who is taking the spotlight from the blond girl and now she's freaking out. Its sooo crazy. Women can be so jealous and catty which is why I have no friends or I'll just be friends with big girls.|`|ytMpRueeaa	idk. but i totally agree with you. some B*tches really need to calm dow. it especially annoying when an ugly chick does it cus she does i twice as much|`|qMB9FVswaa	Wow i wish i really knew the answer to this question. I think its retarded and yes girls should be comfortable with who they are b/c for the most part guys dont care|`|0hSpsSByaa	You are correct about the outcome.  I would say a combination of plain old human nature together with society's emphasis on looks combine to make these girls behave that way.|`|aEdkaXmtaa	i enjoyed reading your rant...|`|Dimi8By2aa	It's just our nature, almost every girl does it.

Sex gets better as you get older. You'll learn.    Ya he mentioned ecstacy the feeling not the drug. Shouldn't you question her parents more than him? They let their 15 year old sing it.    Michael Jackson allegedly touched little boys under the of 10.    R Kelly allegedly had sex with a willing 17 year old girl. Same thing? I'm not so sure.

GI9WSvLzaa	there's something going on!!! And you know," where there is smoke, can be fire";)  try to find out by mentioning some gay stuff, and see his reaction, than maybe pull out a joke of you two, and see how he will react than!  I have friends that were first straight with girls, but actually long the way they ended up gay:) so there is nothing you can lose, only get a new boyfriend..  but of course try this only if you can firstly put it as a joke, so you wont freak him out  Good luck  p.s. this is very common, for gay guys to have relationship with girls ( so there is a possibility for him to want only sex with you ,don't be surprised)|`|7ANokmMNaa	I'm not a guy, but it certainly sounds like he's coming on to you. Perhaps you can ask him? It wouldn't hurt.|`|m1OGfRejaa	I agree with K...It wouldn't be bad to ask him if he really likes you...it sounds like he is bi though..so idk. Good luck!|`|W545hqrpaa	he likes u|`|MvmuZMG4aa	You guys should just stay that way, kinda touchy feely but nothin more than that.. one of the worst things in the world is to lose a friend... its really nice to have a close friend like that.|`|gkoX68Awaa	Simple answer. You said he has a girlfriend, that makes him totally off-limits.     Would you be willing to do the back rubs etc with her sitting right in front of you two watching ?    Explain to him about personal space and remind him friends will respect that space.|`|zgBPtQXraa	Those sound like steps 2 hittin' on someone, I wonder whether he knows u'r gay though... u should try asking it 2 him directly o' course try using the right words cause if he is straight he might get upset 'bout it. Also as he has a girlfriend that means that he has, either being gay or not, chosen that way of livin' and u gotta respect that, unless he gives u any other veeeery explicit hint I'd leave it like that "platonic affection" and just b friends|`|ChhOatcZaa	I think that is cute!!  Why not try to hold hands with him and see what he does. Never mind the girl friend, he isnot married and needs to see if he is into the same sex.  go for it!!!

Good luck with the essay. ;-)|`|bjgs0szFaa	My dictionary says "prsager, annoncer, laisser prvoir".  I think "prsager" is the best translation.
zyJ0Ih9aaa	i think that is really nice, because a lot more thought has gone into it, and it is something that he can keep as well, and the fact that u spent a lot of time on it.

I think if you believe it is the end of time ... make peace w/ your creator and do what is right.|`|pSZ1dGCmaa	just keep an open mind that 2012 is probably a business oriented scam to get people to buy alot of stuff. if you can recall Y2K it was supposedly going to be the end of the world because all technology was going to fail and business's took advantage of that and made a heck load of money just from selling food and water.    now i could be wrong, but you just gotta keep an open mind about it.    and think of it, if 2012 was going to really happen, how come we haven't heard any information from the astrologists, scientists and mathematicians of today who probably know alot more than the mayans did centuries ago
MM5iGrnIaa	Ah Valentines day...  A day of love, but also a day of history    History fact:    During the time that prohibition was in affect major liquor bootleggers such as Al Capone,  set up a meeting.  Shortly after the metting started, policemen with Thompson machine guns arrived at the scene, where they had all the gangster lined up against the wall, and executed them brutality.  However, the police men were actually Al capon's men; this was has way of "eliminating the competition"    That event is known as the "Saint valentines Massacre"    For some, Valentines day is just that " a Massacre"

FcZU29W6aa	I often answer a question and think I am the first one to answer.  By the time I am finished and submit the answer, there are often 5 or 6 answers already!!!    So, that is probably why.  In fact, one guy edited his answer and typed in "dang, I need to learn to type faster".  He probably thought he'd be the first answer.    In fact, it looked as though I was going to be your first answer -- let's see -------    EDIT:  Well, I am your first answer.  Hopefully you'll get a few more.|`|D4GHgDl4aa	You're being unfair. I can start an answer, and be the first, but by the time I finish and press submit there are already 3 or 4 answers there. I don't get to see those answers until I press submit. If a question shows there are answers then I don't go there . You have a choice: forgive me or teach me to type fast.|`|O3k4t0i9aa	You're right-that is annoying, esp. for the person who gave the correct answer to begin with! I think sometimes two people are just answering at the same time and happen to have the correct answer, but a lot of the time they just want to appear correct, go through the answers, find one that sounds right, and reword it.|`|VMY7No0eaa	because I don't usaually READ all the ans until after I have ans.   or my take on it will be just a bit diffent.  or by the time I submit (like others said) mine will be  4 down!   no not bugging me!   your all by yourself!|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	A big thumbs up to all those above me!|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Some people are slow typists. By the time that you post your answer, ten other people did so as well, and you didn't know that they were answering too, as everyone submitted their answers at almost the same time.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	It depends. Sometimes, questions are answered so quickly, that it appears everyone has copied the first answer, or that people assume they are the first to answer and there is a string of answers in front of them.    Also, thumbs up don't really provide validity to an answer in all cases. I tend to give thumbs up if an answer is good and explains itself. However, if I feel I can contribute something extra, I will answer the question again, providing the extra information in my answer.|`|ern87uWhaa	I answer the question by using my common sense which a lot of people are lacking or can not access.  I care not about the drama of thumbs up or down.  Just passing time.|`|mnEkv7xdaa	No, it's not bugging me at all. Sometimes 5-10-15 people are on here answering a question at the same time. Shoot, for all I know someone else could be saying the exact same thing as me right this second. Guess I won't know till I hit "submit," huh? And even then I won't feel bad about it. I'll just keep sippin' my coffee and answer something else.|`|aZsyxJ5Gaa	1.well,id have to agree with the first dude who answered coz it happens to me alot.    2.i dont usually read the answers,i just read the question n answer it right away.    3.i dont just follow the crowds,its not me so i hate just giving thumbs up,id rather voice my own opinion even if it matches some1 else's..    Hope im the 1st one who gave this answer ;)|`|fpGroPpzaa	It is because everyone wants to win. No one wants to come in last. People try to be the first to answer a question so they end up not answering the question in the best way, but in the most COMMON way, which may or may not necessarily be correct.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	I asked a question a while back about whether people read the other answers before providing their own response.  For the most part they don't.  It's mostly because I think they don't want what another person said to influence their initial reaction to the situation.  That's how you get more honest answers.  Of course, there's nothing stopping them from altering their response if they see an answer that moves them differently.  After I answer a question with my thoughts, I will go and provide TU or TD based on the content and quality of other answers.    Hope that helps.|`|BMGEi0yCaa	Ah! I know what you mean. When someone asks the question, "what's the name of this song?" and 38 people give them same answer - that's kind of annoying. The people above me had it right, a lot of those answers are probably because a whole bunch of people were answering the question at the same time. Plus, I think if someone knows the answer, even if people have already answered it 38 times, they'll answer again anyway just for the 2 points.    What really bugs me is when people answer a question by saying "idk sorry". I know they probably just want the two points, but I wish there was button you could press (besides the 'Report' button) that gets rid of extremely unhelpful answers, such as those. Ugh.
FcZU29W6aa	I would not get him a gift.  You two are just rekindling a friendship and he may feel it is a bit pushy at this point.  It may make him feel as though he will "owe" you and right now you want him to feel more relaxed and let the friendship develop.    Good luck -- it sounds as though you are glad to have him back in your life -- take it slow so he does not feel he is going from a divorce to being in a relationship too soon.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	It is competley inappropriate.  Valentines gifts are for sweethearts not friends.|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	If you recently, got back together, then I see no reason not to give him a gift, although it should be a small one.|`|fpGroPpzaa	Just chocolates, because you can give them to anyone and it might help him get over his ex-wife. Anything more expensive than that is inappropriate.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	No you shouldn't. He will feel awkward... especially if he didn't get you anything in return.|`|PPoyjq3Vaa	If he wants you bad now, give him the gift.     If you want him, but you aren't sure if he wants you that bad...  then just get him a card.|`|REC4YgOuaa	use your common sense what do you think?

Only if you like spend the night. We had a neighbor who we were friends with come over every day a take a crap in our bathroom. It got really distgusting.|`|gfiTCFTeaa	Yeah, but it depends if i really really have to go or not.

If its someone I just met, or friend of a friend, well I will hold it.|`|mcE9C06Saa	Well if you really gotta go, then you don't have a choice.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	No. I can't because I have stomach issues. If you gotta go, you should go. Otherwise holding it can cause constipation. :(|`|BMGEi0yCaa	I usually try to, unless I'm about to burst. Even when I do have to go, I always feel like my number 2 smells a million times more horrible than it actually does, and I'm always afraid that the owner of the house is going to kick me out. Ridiculous, I know. But, as natural as number 2 is, it's still a little gross.    My dad was actually at client's house one day and he had a "I'm going to mess myself if I don't go NOW" moment. He tried to be as discreet as possible I guess, but the woman found out that he went number 2 in her house and FREAKED. Went insane. Psycho. Called his boss and screamed at his boss about it. It was stupid, but what was he supposed to do? Go crouch outside a bush outside? Anyway, I'm always afraid that that'll happen to me, lol.|`|brKxytiXaa	yeah all the time|`|bSqzbDPFaa	sometimes my body wont let me go  2 but if i have to go i  will i wont hold back that causes too many problems
YS3E6Pz2aa	My grilfriend likes to open the door for me wherever we go. I try to open doors for her but everytime I do we get into this little staring contest like,   "Go."  "No, YOU go."  "No, ladies first."  "I'm not a lady, I'm a dyke! You go!"  It's really funny.  But I guess it just depends on if you feel like doing it or not. You can trade off, with girls I feel like it's saying "I care about you enough to do these polite things"  So whatever you feel like doing, do it.  -Sam|`|po4j4xhAaa	My Grandmother taught me that if I was going to date women, I had to learn how to be a "gentleman".  So she taught me to do things like open doors and hold chairs and suchlike 'traditional' things.  Politeness never goes out of style, and it has nothing to do with dominance.  Your gf may get to the door first and hold it open for you and there's nothing wrong with that.|`|TYQOafA8aa	Well if you play the "guy" role in this relationship then yes, when my gf and I get together with a jock he has these attentions with both of us.|`|lL5lKNIiaa	My GF likes to do that kind of stuff for me, but I do not look at her as guy like. she actually does everything a guy does (or is supposed to do) for a girl. she pays for food for me and her when we go out, but not because I cant afford buying food ar anything, sh just likes to pay for things, buy me random gifts, take me on dates, and drive the 30 min to see me. even when I drive to see her she wont let me leave without giving me money or gas. I really don't see her as guy like because she is so girly except for these things. but in the end who cares if you are guy like for being nice and caring. just do what you feel you should do no matter how it seems. hope that helps.

But my wife does it for me as well.  It's not like one of you has to do it more than the other, or one is obligated to do it more.      In my world, it has nothing to do with dominance & everything to do with doing things for your lady.   Do what feels comfortable for both of you.|`|iwNYcerfaa	Well, I'm not the dominant one, my gf is, but she's never pulled out the chair for me, but she has opened doors for me.

Now, to answer your query; no it is not mannerable to offer a score card to your damsel of the evening. Not only will it ruin your chances of a second encounter but it will also show the bird that you have less class than she previously thought. Hence the degredation. I must add, that if you have time to invent a scoring system, then you sir must not be guilding the lilly as oft as you would like for everyone to believe. G'Day!|`|9449e10cc4bd54a354c906e0564176ecaa	You're such a gentleman, Rotter.|`|Cc9MEn9Caa	My dear, the problem is that a lady must receive her score in writing with a full break down of the criteria. Perhaps you coud devise some sort of evaluation sheet including criteria such as participation,effort and technical ability? Then you must fill it whilst enjoying your post-coital cigar.     As a point of scientific interest old chap, do the Swedish twins get the same score given that they have identical DNA?  Just wondering if sexual performance is inherited you know.

The "young" Lady who told me, (48,if she was a day) had apparently fled at the sight of "Little Rotter" whom she describes as "two and a half inches of suppurating pox ridden gristle". She says she was the only one who escaped, and the rest of the Womens institute Light Operatic Society were still trapped inside.    Surely she must mean some other Rotter, right?|`|UnEQAsEEaa	Come come!  All can improve given the right teacher.  However, if you are going to start handing out diplomas you will be forced to establish formal criteria for assessment, have your assessments subject to appeal and moderation, and submit to regular Ofsted inspections.

She should have taken it as constructive criticism if you ask me!    Keep up the good work old chap and keep scoring!|`|hce6sWyAaa	When this happened to me, I was so enraged that I invited the girl back again the following week. Ten sex experts were secretly hiding in the adjoining room and watched everything via hidden cameras.    After we had finished, the "judges" were invited in with a scorecard in each hand (as they do in the Olympics). Naturally the girl was embarrassed but not as much as she had been when she needed a calculator to add up these simple numbers (yes, she was a blonde). Nonetheless, she calculated the score at 1.9.     She ran out of the room crying leaving her knickers behind which were washed and then placed on the wall of fame with the others.     It's good to put them on the wall chart so you can show new girls that enter the Rotter boudoir what will happen to them also, should they get a low score  it makes them try harder, sir.    Hope this helps.|`|KUqdiO4waa	You are way to harsh on your marking system, you only give me an 8 !and I never once winced when you scalded me with hot custard and plunged your mammoth rotter sausage into me without any warning (or foreplay)  nor did I once complain about the constant flash light photography and the unusual objects and reptiles you used.    I would love to know what you would rate as a 10 ( I'm a perfectionist and I would love to get a perfect 10 from you ( and any of your chums)
YS3E6Pz2aa	All my experiences were...awkward. I usually got dates because I was intelligent enough to make a guy laugh and I actually listened to them when they talked.

With girls, it was so easy for me.  -Sam|`|l7pMJfCTaa	lol alice i just thumbed Tara J down didnt even notice that :) Oh and by the way Tara J said she was Bi in a previous answer.....

So, that's about as intimate as you can get, right?  I was in the military as well, so it was pushed pretty hard to be straight.  When I stopped fighting myself & accepted that I was gay, I still had to keep up the facade so I wouldn't get kicked out.  At that point, I would date sporadically for appearances, but no more sex with men.    It was pretty easy to get into relationships with men.  Even when I started my transition away from men, I still had a lot of guys interested in me.  It got to the point after I had a few lesbian experiences under my belt to confirm my striaghtness was just a phase, I would still get hit on by straight men in gay clubs when I went out (even dressing all like a tomboy).  This still continues to this day if I go out & actually dress to impress.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Nasty. They used me and treat me like dirt.

sqNsOIzkaa	Well if it was me back in high school.     A) Tell it to her face nobody cares what she says and say what you feel to her. But not in school where you CAN get in trouble. She needs to know...she's not being liked by being a rat.    B) Ignore her, giving her attention may make her...happier.    C) Stay away from her everytime you talk. Tell her politely to stop following you if she does. If not, maybe have an authority try to deal with it. But most teachers and principals would probably not care.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Just behave and follow the rules, and she will not snitch. Ignore her.

LOL|`|CDdOegXraa	tell on her back and see how she likes it? or just to worry about her|`|AA11598520	It is NOT for you to do anything. It is for your teacher to tell her to stop and to call her parents in on it. I would be careful while around her, though, since if she is reporting everything, the teacher will find out when you're doing things you shouldn't. Some kids think they are helping the teacher and are unable to stop since they've been doing this for so long. I can tell you from experience, it gets old fast. You, though, will only get into trouble trying to keep her quiet.|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	Leave it to the teacher.

I hate people that do that also. Ugh thats so annoying and lame at that. Maybe shes jealous of you and your friends or something.|`|BqXSymxjaa	Ignore her. If she doesn't get a reaction, it wont be fun for her anymore.|`|JrfQg6Xtaa	If you are in high school, have your girlfriend (or if you are a girl, do it yourself) give her a good scaring. "Shake her down", do not do this on school grounds, and do not hurt her. The main thing is to scare her out of her ridiculous tactics, not to harm her in any way shape or form.    If you are in middle school, you're going to have to deal with it. Hopefully by the time you land in the 91-11-2, she'll get over herself.

7258da4c2329311982666e5727f6ae14aa	Hmmm... I've had to think this over carefully. My instinctive response was that "I know better than to stereotype people by their looks", but...     I wouldn't say that so-and-so looking person will have a IQ number of so and so that's for sure, but I'd pick out those that has visible mental handicaps and put them lower on the scale automatically. There are also people that have "empty eyes" (the lights are on but no one is at home) and I'd put them lower on the scale than those with life full and awake eyes. The mouths are important too and they have to match the eyes for me to make the judgment. A smile combined with empty eyes is easier to "forgive" than awake eyes with a "empty nest" mouth to go with it.     Other factors that would play in is if the person reminds me of anyone that I have had some sort of experience with since before. It doesn't have with intelligence to do at all, but the judgment would still be based on the motions that person provoke. If someone reminds me of a dumb person that I really dislike then my feeling will make me rate him/her as dumb too whether it's fair or not. Such stereotypes are easy to kill when you meet in person but a bit harder to pass by when it's only about a picture.     I think the most intelligent person in the world has never had a test to prove it and that you find him/her at a place that you'd see as very unlikely when you generalize. If that person was found and brought to the attention of the rest of the world then we'd all have to redefine what intelligent is and how to stereotype it. =)

3jvwIReDaa	Well, you sound like an awful teacher, to be honest. This young woman worked hard on a presentation and you acted like a jerk. I have a hard time believing that you are an actual certified teacher, especially in the history field. Why? Because you wrote the word "Injun" and said you have never heard of what she presented. A teacher should always know more than his/her student, especially in their respective field.|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	Ha ha.  You just wasted 2 minutes of my life reading this lie.  If you are a teacher, then I am an aardvark|`|sQ3PG8Ewaa	I know you were bored during the presentation, but she must have been bored with putting the presentation together and working on it. That wasted hours of her life, and she still got a failing grade, because you didn't feel like doing your job. Do you think that's fair?|`|kjFjGrOvaa	If my school ever had a substitute that acted like you did they would remove you from the sub list. You obviously do not have a love for teaching or working with kids. I don't condone the name calling but I hope they took it to the principal. You may want to get into a different field. I don't think she wasted 15 minutes of your life but you certainly wasted some of theirs.|`|n560blqraa	Actually, I believe she called you "douches" as in well you see my point. (feminine product) sorry to correct your spelling teacher! You were apparently rude to her and she was misinformed by someone into thinking the longer presentation would give her a better grade. Perhaps you should have been a little more understanding with your student, even as a substitute teacher. Maybe the way you handled the situation could have been more politically correct, and in turn she would have been as well.|`|GFzdaNrKaa	Why did you change the grade sheet?  If the teacher who made the assignment said the report should be 15 minutes long then she should not have gotten a bad grade for a 15 minute report.  You were unfair how you graded her.  And what's an "Injun"?  That word comes up as a misspelled word on my spell check.  Are your referring to Native Americans also known as American Indians, if so why don't you say so?|`|AA11674544	you were disrespectful. They responded as typical teenagers. You should have predicted that one!|`|JrfQg6Xtaa	I am a high school student, and in our Art class we have had substitutes for the past month or two due to our teacher getting fired for sexual harassment.    Our first substitute was very odd, didn't know much about Art. She was dubbed "Miss Freaklioni", because her last name was Franklioni.    Our second substitute became a quick favorite, but he made the mistake of saying "dawg". He is a middle aged white man, His name is Mr. G, or Gateriff, and in my books he's pretty cool, be he will forever be immortalized by the names "Vanilla Ice, Iced Tea, Mr. Pee, Gatecouchie."    Our third substitute came yesterday, and she has already messed up. Her name is "Misses Tuna, Matecouchie, and Sergeant Hetero".    If you are a substitute, take these in stride, as you will receive many nicknames, whether out of affection or spite.    Also, to tell a student that they wasted your time:    Is not good. Unless you are their teacher, and they've known you all year long, you need to treat the with upmost respect.     You shouldn't have been grading their reports if you were a sub!    If a student gives you a hassle, write him/her a referral, to be turned into the office.

Standards for third world countries are often lower than "first" world countries in terms of economy or level of industrialization, globalization, standard of living, health, education or other criteria for 'advancements'. This means that they are often not as much a part of the world as some other countries, including the US and Canada. They do not participate in world trade, or have limited participation, have little to no health care facilities, few if any factories to produce goods and therefore have to make textile objects by hand, are often illiterate or limited in their education (i.e., an elementary to early middle school education at best), and many live in poverty. If most of the population fits a good amount of this criteria, the country itself is then labeled "third world." As for the claim that Korea is third world, it depends on which part of the country. According to the data I found, a high percentage of Koreans make less than $1 USD a day, which puts the country on the third world rating.|`|GPznIhzMaa	Are they confusing South Korea with North Korea?|`|QlCRHbmBaa	mm|`|4DxFK7TNaa	Because our educational system can be of a third world sometimes|`|xy4z8bQraa	because korea does not have the same technology as other countries.|`|9XA7KxK5aa	People maybe talking about north korea.|`|DUicCMGFaa	South Korea is fine, but North Korea is a completely different cup of tea, no pun intended.

Its partially based on color. The accent and where you were born doesn't make you black. Your color does. Since your skin is darker than the average Caucasians and you are of African descent, you are considered black. Its not completely accurate, but that's just how it works.

I get mad when I clearly tell a man what I don't like and then he does it anyway. He should know better. I happen to like flowers but don't want them on V-Day because they jack up the prices. I'd rather have them when it's more of a surprise, like because I had a bad day or something. At least your guy's intentions were romantic so you should probably cut him some slack this time and remind him that you'd prefer something more practical in the future. I had a boyfriend get me new tires one Christmas and I was thrilled because that's what I really needed and he remembered.|`|1f2movZZaa	Men are raised all their lives thinking that cut roses are the embodiment of love and affection. You might think that he understands that you don't like cut flowers (I prefer live ones myself, as well), but it has probably only confused him. After hearing that its the perfect way to show your love for his whole life, it's hard for him to understand why you wouldn't want that. He's trying to be romantic and surprise you, and possibly thinks that when you told him you didn't like flowers, you were just trying to politely wave aside a gift. This shows that even when given a way out of giving you something, he still opts to pamper you the best way that he knows how.    I know that you don't like cut flowers, but try to see them for what they are in his eyes: a token of love and endearment. That's what he's really trying to say to you. Yelling at him for it will just hurt him, because in his own eyes, it's a sweet, romantic surprise for you. My mother once got an emerald necklace for Christmas from my father, and screamed at him for it since she was against spending extra money. She made him take it back, and it virtually broke his heart.    Rejecting a gift from him, in his eyes, is the same thing as rejecting him personally. He tried his best, try to honor that. He doesn't understand why anyone wouldn't want cut flowers, even if he pretends to. That's why he's doing this for you.    He has given you a sweet gift that does have meaning, if not in your eyes. Roses have symbolized love and affection for centuries, so try to accept it on that. By giving you roses, he's giving you the promise of his love. That's the real gift. If you love him back, don't reject it, because he'll take it as a sign that you don't return that love, that promise.|`|GiHOnv54aa	Sorry to say this but yes that is a little b*tchy. It's a bit like when your boyfriend asks you what you want for your birthday and you reply with "Don't get me anything big, it's ok", you kinda expect him to get you something big anyway, because that's what he's gonna do. I think you kinda need to apologise to your boyfriend, because he was only trying to please you (even if you said you didn't want flowers). Next time keep in mind he wants to make you happy and probably thought you only said you didn't want flowers because he said he was going to get you some. Feel lucky that your boyfriend didn't break up with you 2 weeks before the most romantic day of the year.   happy v day even so  X|`|0PFQipk4aa	I see your point and I think your gripe is founded. He should get you what you want.    I dont think any of the people above me actually read your question, one even thinks he's your boyfriend! Jeeeez. You already HAVE told him in the past what you wanted, and like you said, he's taking the easy road. I wouldn't like it either. I have to tell my husband EXACTLY what to get me for my b-day, Christmas, etc, and thankfully he gets it and doesn't come up with an alternative that I didnt want i the first place.|`|yzOtKTJIaa	your right you are a biatch...i hope he leaves you for someone who deserves him.|`|IPiddfD1aa	I do think the idea of at least getting something was nice, but if he knows you don't like flowers, then he might not be listening to you very well. I wouldn't get too upset over it, but definitely remind him that you don't like flowers:)    Oh yeah, I don't know what Kayla D was thinking, but that's so rude! It's ignorant to say something like that!|`|ATz0xyJ4aa	thats ******* ignorant!  at least he is getting you something  if i were him i would of broke up with your ***.  and throw you on the street to die. =)|`|HrBkIT4raa	Tell him you prefer having sex and scratch his back with the pricks on the roses|`|hkfSslxKaa	wooow. thats messed up of u. hes trying to be nice. would u rather have a guy not even think of u and not get u anything?!?!?!?|`|XPSIn3wxaa	Personally I would put your ungratful *** on the street and wish you a good day.    You should be thankful he even remembered.    Go get a life...|`|rxqZ1nLgaa	Your being ungrateful.  Its not that he doesnt care. Hes a MAN, they dont remeber silly little things like that. And although you may have told him you dont like them, dont be such a ***** about it. Hes obviously going to be really excited about suprising you with them. Get over it. You should be happy for any present you get. Its the though that counts.|`|3abf57b861828e0ad5d943b22097ab8faa	But honestly, do you know that they are for you?  Could they be for a sister, niece, mom, step mom cousin?    If you do indeed get them, smile and thank him.  No need to make a scene, or make a joke about how you would prefer anything but flowers.  Just smile, and say that are beautiful.|`|HcBp3cFDaa	woahh..  stop being rude.  it IS the thought that counts.   if i were him i would break up with you.|`|MnXQsn62aa	Its just your opinion and personally i would i wouldn't get so mad about it|`|22be888c1197f4d3213b386a8fc829c2aa	Maybe he got the flowers for some other woman. Maybe he's cheating on you because you're such a "Picky Eccentric" wife!    I don't really like flowers all that much either, but I would NEVER EVER be a jerk to my husband because he got me a not so perfect GIFT!    Be grateful and appreciative or move on and let some other woman enjoy him and his flowers.

Velvet pants    leather, fur, or velvet vests    anything that's considered all natural (cotton, wool, etc.)    socks and sandals (together)     Tee shirts/long shirts with political slogons or slogons that talk about world peace and or love.     head bands made of beads, leather, cloth material    big earrings (hoops, beaded earrings, Native American earrings, etc.)    Girls wore bell bottoms, mini skirts or flowery dresses    They also liked to wear lots of layers (because they were all ways on the move).    Lots of necklaces (beaded mainly)    They also carried nap sacks (bags, backpacks) with them on their travels.    Anything with peace signs.    They also wore a lot of flowers in their hair.    Hippies were usually very friendly. And they frequently talked about love and peace and trying to make the world a better place. Some hippies however were real hard a$$es. They would shout at the cops and call them pigs (and tons of other cuss words), throw bottles at them and charge them, when they were protesting.   It's up to you do decide what kind of hippie you want to be: the love and peace hippie or the hard a$$ protester type. (Either one will do.)    Good luck, hope you win the bet.

ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...

AA11870386	Every company is different. I fired a guy about a month ago for being constantly late. It was usually only a few minutes but that wasn't the point. Here, we work 12 hour shifts and can't leave until relieved. Coming in late is inconsiderate and I don't stand for it.  My wife, on the other hand, used to work at a bank and I don't think she was ever on time. Didn't matter so much there.|`|AA12185724	I'm a white southern girl and I was late 2 or 3 days this past week.  Not 2 hours but still late.      Just because someone is late doesn't mean they don't work later to make up the time or work harder to get their stuff done.    So.. my official answer is:    1.  Being Kenyan has no more to do with being late than liking fried chicken and watermelon has to do with being black (trust me, my WHITE boyfriend LOVES watermelon).    2.  If you are not directly over any of these people it is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!!!  Worry about getting your job done well and mind your own.  Seems to me that if you are second-guessing your superiors and worrying more about other peoples work than your own, you aren't that great of an employee either!|`|fcbe77a2314b4069b50646b10b431f6aaa	If you're not the boss, and not paying these employees, get over it. If some Kenyans come in late and some come in on time, then it doesn't sound like its being Kenyan that makes them late, but it does make you sound prejudice.  This is you're boss's fault if he lets this go on. If the lateness is causing you a problem because you have to work more to cover them for not being there, ask your boss for a raise.|`|AA11711150	I work in a factory where a few have been allowed to come in late for years.  I have no idea why the company puts up with this.  Culture, race or religion has nothing to do with terminal lateness, it happens in every group.  I've never been able to understand why or how people can be late all the time for any and everything.|`|f440bc17a47f282dadb9f465c902e40caa	Kenyans?  who cares who they are?  if you are late you are neglecting your duties-the reason you were hired-to get the work done. and putting extra work on those that are there.  to answer your ?- twice and then its time for them to not show up some where else.|`|17b3db3c06e0396e9c904bd17083a808aa	What does them being Kenyans have to do with anything? racist
zCjzu5claa	Latino men like all kinds of races as long as they look hot, the reason they end up only dating their own race is for 2 reasons.    1. the other race does not like latino men or woman.  2. the other race does not cook good latin flavor food latin men love.    so they we latinos are spoiled with home made cook and they look for the latin woman that can fulfill not only his heart but his stomach as well.|`|P4u9yOHKaa	Bcuz Latin ppl like Latin ppl.

dYwvTj5Caa	Much of my respect for Etta James has been lost. 71 year old, and still acting so low-class and unprofessional? The song was originally by Glenn Miller. She COVERED the song. Who said she had the rights to be angry? She HAS NO RIGHTS.    We're talking about a young, successful, and establish artist who look up to Etta. She gained 20lbs. for the movie, sang for Etta in an award show, and had express her respect for Etta more than once!    Fact of the matter is, Beyonce made Etta more famous than Etta ever was! If it wasn't for Cadillac Records and the covers Beyonce made, Etta's name wouldn't be known to our generation today. More than anything, she should THANK Beyonce.    But let's talk about the real kicker: Etta James dislike Obama. I'm talking about "he's not my president" kind of dislike. Even if Obama asked her to sing instead of Beyonce, would she even come? I think not.    Etta, word of advice: YOU HAD 50 YEARS TO GROW UP. It's definitely time now that you're 71.|`|z93tSvKxaa	FINALLY! Someone who sees thru the media fakeness of Beyonce.  BEYONCE CANNOT SING.  The only thing she does is shake her butt and wear a big weave.  She needs to take voice lessons because she cannot hold a note.      Of course you young people who never lived thru real soul singers such as Etta James, The Supremes, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, Tina Turner, Patti Labelle, Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn, and Patsy Cline do not know what real singing is.  Even modern singers such as Whitney Houston and Celine Dion and Mariah Carey blow Beyonce out of the water.    Obama really did a disservice by having Beyonce sing.  HE SHOULD HAVE HAD EITHER ETTA JAMES or even Mariah Carey sing.  It would have been much much much more memorable.      Beyonce is nothing but a hip hop person, not a singer. I would categorize her with Lil Kim or some other rapper.|`|6ac013da2dceabac6383ebdee4f828c0aa	Etta was out of line and showed her lack of class.  I mean, was she joking?      I'm not a Beyonce fan; I don't think she is all that talented, but I fail to see what she did wrong.|`|UnG3dS7xaa	I think it's her prerogative as it's her song. While I don't think it was the classiest gesture in the world to make it public. On a side note, Etta has a voice Beyonce couldn't dream of having.     What the article made me think about is why a woman can't make a negative statement about another woman without being viewed as being jealous.|`|DHzwr1braa	She is too old to be reacting in that manner. Very classless. Obama wanted Beyonce to sing that song, exactly what else could she have song anyway, Dangerously in love. Ms. Etta James needs to handle this in a mature way, but in my own opinion it is not that serious.|`|00b5UjqBaa	I'm not a huge fan of Beyonce, but I do think that Beyonce is probably shocked, maybe even embarassed. Etta sure wasn't/isn't, she had no problem saying what she had to say. I think Etta just wanted a little respect; someone requested "At Last" be sang at a ball, you automatically think of Etta James, not Beyonce. Beyonce probably thought she was doing a good thing by singing the song. I don't think anyone thought that this would blow up like it did, nor did they think it would mean any harm.    Also, people probably didn't know she wasn't an Obama supporter until now. She never came out publicly and said "I don't like Obama."    You have to put yourself in Etta's shoes. Etta has been singing that song for over 40 years, and you would think that you would ask her to sing the song (maybe, after all, that is the most famous version). It's like asking Rihanna to sing Midnight Train to Georgia, when everyone knows Gladys Knight is the original recorder. Whether she wrote the song or not, give credit to where credit is due. Think of it as if you were a singer. You've been singing a song for 40 years, and everyone knows your version. Someone requests that the song be sang, and they don't even bother to ask you. Etta was probably hurt.    Etta James won her fame by singing a beautiful ballad, and using her voice, not her body, not by dancing half naked on stage or performing an entire video with only underwear, or pole dancing. Think about it.    Edit- When a person samples a song, they have to seek permission, or else things get legal. ASCAP or BMI catches that stuff, they have trained people to catch samples. It's just a matter of respect. That's something that the hip hop generation doesn't have. They will sample to person's song, but would they bother to sit down and talk to them? Not only that, but people these days can't seem to come up with anything of their own. Where is the real music? People are singing to machines, not with their heart. Instead, they disrobe themselves to get attention.

Perhaps Beyonce could have chosen one of her own, oops she doesn't have an appropriate one to sing. Her bad. She lacks talent and class. She is beautiful and, well that's all. Then again, so am I.

Any South American who wants to get out of their own country, their best bet is the US because they probably can't afford to get a plane to Europe and anyway it would be much harder.  The EU has 27 countries in it where they can go into eachother's country with no visa, that automatically slashes "illegal" Immigration, they still come but they are legal, all the borders are open.  Europe gets a **** load of Immigrants from Africa and the Middle East so Im not sure what Dan in Miami is talking about.  My God sometimes people would swear the US is the only "desirable" country in the eyes of any Immigrant.  They choose the best possible option they think they can manage to get a decent living, if they found it easier to get into the EU than the US they would pick that.  So enough of this "Why are so many trying to come here?" as if you're the only country that has to deal with Illegal Immigration.|`|rYg3SOFpaa	because we have the ability to have anything we want (if we have money) .......|`|xWGJHMkuaa	1) We owe china money because we are the worlds consumers. without us china is nothing. china is dependant on our consumerism.

So I would try to find a way to immerse yourself in the language.   Definitely try to find a native spanish speaker that you could practice with for at least one a week.  This will give you practice speaking, and help build up your confidence for when you have to face your counselor.  It the meantime, I would try finding a more interactive and fun way to study than just from a book.  I really like the site that BBC has set up.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/spanish/  Another one is http://www.studyspanish.com/default.htm  As an online dictionary http://www.wordreference.com is really good.  Most of all, try not to stress about it.  Learning any language is never easy.  Some studies show that it takes 3000+ of concentrated study hours for an English speaker to learn a romantic language to achieve a decent speaking ability.  The more you stress, the harder it will be to learn.  If you are really deidcated to learning the language later on in life, I would suject a study or work abroad program.  This is the easiest way to learn.  As a beginner project, I would suggest something colorful in poster form.  And maybe chose a theme such as weather, pass times, or animals.  Good luck, and don't give up!|`|bd5c7de49b15ec5ce776bd359797a407aa	Try this website:    http://www.mansionspanish.com  .
GZkUxstWaa	German is not at all similar to French. If you want to know about it technically, there is a "language-family" which is for "Indo-European Languages". This family encompasses the majority of the world's main languages, including Spanish, English, Hindi, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, German, Marathi, French, Italian, Punjabi and Urdu. Within this vast family of languages, there are "Italic languages" and then there are "Germanic languages". French is an Italic language, and German is a Germanic language. So in theory, German has as much of a connection to French as it does to Urdu. And that's not very much.|`|AjFA8qIxaa	It is not similar at all.

Either "Nuh uh, prove it" or "Ooh I wanna see it".  What logical sense does it make for you to tell me you have an alien in your closet and then ask me to prove that it does not exist?

If the creep is of an unusually high caliber, he can also torture and dismember his targets quite effectively.    A prick can either be (a) an ill-tempered bastard (b) an oversexed weirdo, or (c) your boss. No real smarts required there.    A jerk can be as stupid as you please. It takes no intellect whatsoever to be a roaring jackass.|`|AA10969077	A prick has more integrity. A prick has a huge sense of self and an ego so big that he can't respect anyone else or pay attention to their problems, which he sees as inconsequential to his own. It's a massive personality disorder, but it doesn't mean he's stupid or lacks integrity, just means he's blind to his own faults and doesn't care about anyone else. The prick is clueless about the feelings and desires of others. He might just assume that everyone feels the same way he does. Ironically, this blinder that covers the pricks eyes makes him have the most integrity. He just doesn't know any better.     A creep has little sense of worth in others and will use them for his own, perverse entertainment. Really bad creeps crawl the Internet looking for anonymous sex with strangers, peek into neighbors windows to catch them un-dressing, and might even be a pedophile. The worst cruise the Internet for younglings, gains their trust, and finds ways to exploit that trust for their own gratification.     A jerk understands how others feel and might know what they desire, but doesn't care. A prick becomes a jerk when he understands what other's feel and want but doesn't care anyways. The jerk might even do things just to spite the feelings of others. The jerk is more intelligent than the prick, but it's a toss up, intelligence wise, between jerk and creep.

All He wants is a relationship with Him, to believe in Him alone, to read His instruction manual (the Bible), and to talk to Him in prayer.  Hearing Him answer through prayer is possible.  I know.  I used to have religion.  All I have is a relationship with Him now.  And I can truly say I fully understood what He meant what He said in John 10:10 of the New Testament of the Bible: "I have come (in your life) so that you might have life and have it to the full."

Knowing that I am connected with the Almighty God as a child of light and finally knowing and understanding what He expects of me and how He will bless me beyond anything I can imagine and I in turn share those blessings with others.  There are just so many things.  Repentence through Jesus Christ made an incredible change in my life and put me on a new path.  As a Christian I am no longer involved with any denomination.

God is present in the heart of one and all. It is because of Bhrama (delusion) that man is unable to realise his divine nature. In the first instance, man should make efforts to overcome this delusion and realise that God is always with him, in him, around him, above him and below him. There cannot be any defects or imperfections in such a divine principle. Whatever defects you think you see are purely the result of your imagination.|`|b0adad2d5242bb9288063765cb8bfe49aa	I'm a God in my own mind.      mmmm . . . cheese whiz . . . got crackers?

Different crops mature at different times, so require different harvest times.    Harvesting one crop on time results in ripping up the other crop before it's ripe.    Also, not all crops are compatible with each other.    One might choke out the other, hogging all the available nitrogen, water, and nutrients.    Every time I've taken the time to research these things, God has always been right.    Now I just accept his word on faith, and save a lot of time and trouble.|`|25ca6ed43902e09683d1d7f9418dd2f3aa	What version of Leviticus are you using . just did a quick read through the KJV version and don;t see anything about that . mostly about animals used for sacrifice.  The transition from Idolatry to Monotheism by Moses after the Exodus.  The only thing that comes close is not in Leviticus but another book about not spilling your seed on infertile soil.  Try rephrasing your question and then I might be able to make an answer.
d19fd6796e70b46195ccf6e90950d2acaa	Yes, but we must do the will of God.     God also became grieved at man.    Genesis 6:5-6  And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.  And it REPENTED the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.|`|5b53023601bc989bd48fc4a386f80bd4aa	No, if they don't listen, that is their loss.

But to be quite honest, I can see why people would not want anything to do with Christianity.  Peoples idea of Christianity comes from watching those who claim to know Jesus.  When you watch many pastors on t.v and hear legalistic comments from Christians you meet or answers they give on this site from time to time it would be hard to say, " I sure would like to be part of that."    Please do keep in mind that the only good thing about Christians is Jesus, Period.  Saying that, most people don't have a problem with Jesus, but with some of the people who follow Him.      A pastor once said, " There's two reasons people don't come to church 1) They don't know a christian or 2) They do know a Christian.    All this is to say I do not get discouraged all that often, becuase many of the problems people have with Jesus is not because of Jesus himself, but because of those who represent Him.    I know that every time someone rejects me when I try to share the gospel (good news) with them, I am that much closer to meeting the person who will give me just a few minutes to share with them what it is exactly that Jesus has done for them and why it is so important to have a relationship with him.  The HOPE out weighs the discouragement.    I appreciate your question.  Take care.|`|AA12289333	It used to unbelievably frustrate me. I used to try to almost force people to listen. Now, I realize that is not the way to do it. All we must do is tell others once, if they do not listen then all we can do is pray for them. We should not continue to harass them. God gives everyone free will whether to believe and have faith...He doesn't want someone to be forced.|`|AA10025366	Sometimes, yes.

Deuteronomio 22:5    En esos tiempos no existan los pantalones. La gente lo que utilizaba eran tnicas. Los hombres eran distinguidos por el color de su vestimenta. En ese tiempo Dios estaba estableciendo las reglas ya que el pueblo andaba desordenado.... Es por eso que Dios entrego a Moises las tablas de la LEY. El pueblo de Israel era muy rebelde.     Si usted vive en un clima fro, usar pantalones es como usar batas en medio del desierto. ?Cree usted que si Jess hubiera decidido nacer en Escocia, ?No usara Jess las faldas o polleras escocesas?     Sabiendo todo esto, tampoco es permisible hacer algo que una sociedad no acepta simplemente para molestar a otros. Por ejemplo, cuando se me invita a predicar en una iglesia donde las mujeres usan los pa?os para cubrir sus cabezas, y mi esposa me acompa?a, yo le pido que ella tambin se cubra la cabeza con una pa?o o un sombrero. El mismo derecho que yo tengo de no usar el pa?o en mi iglesia, ellos lo tienen de usar el pa?o en su templo.     Si en su templo en EE.UU. aceptan los pantalones, cuando usted vaya a visitar sus hermanos cristianos en Santo Domingo, donde no usan pantalones, pues ?quteselos!. Para que su compartamiento no se convierta en una piedra de tropiezo para otros. Pero no diga que las hermanas que usan pantalones van para el infierno, o que las hermanas que no los usan van para el cielo. ?Quin le dio a usted categora moral para ponerse como juez?     La hipocresa que reina en medio de muchos crculos religiosos dentro de la misma Iglesia es increble. Permtanme explicarme: Existen personas que critican a algunos cristianos y los acusan de ser liberales por permitir que sus mujeres se pongan pantalones, prendas y maquillaje. A veces llegan al colmo de dudar de la salvacin, alegadamente por sus "prcticas liberales y pecaminosas". Sin embargo, cuando esos mismas persones reciben a misioneros de esas mismas iglesias y a quienes critican, y los misioneros les traen fondos para construir un orfanato, una iglesia, o algn proyecto, sin titubear toman el dinero. ?Pero cmo tomar dinero de gente tan "pecaminosa" como los que usan pantalones o prendas?   Pero el espritu de religiosidad y el legalismo es aun peor. Existen aquellos que se enorgullecen de decir que ellos son ms "santos" que otros porque ellos no le permiten a sus mujeres ni siquiera lavarse la cabeza con ciertos productos de belleza o simplemente desrizarse el pelo. ?Dnde es que dice en la Biblia que hacerse un desrizado es pecado? Lo que Dioes quiere es que se DINSTINGA entre el HOMBRE Y LA MUJER...    Romanos 6:14-15       14 Porque el pecado no se ense?orear de vosotros; pues no estis bajo la ley, sino bajo la gracia.

Un consejo, NUNCA tomes un texto bblico fuera de contexto.   Si te lo ense?an as te estn manipulando, y ense?ndote valores superficiales y de forma, cuando se sabe bien que las apariencias enga?an. Te estn ense?ando que Dios te "amar" por lo que mostrs y no por lo que en realidad sos.      La biblia la conforman diferentes libros que fueron escritos por diferentes autores en pocas y lugares tambin diferentes. Leer en contexto implica saber el lenguaje y estilo del autor, el condicionamiento cultural de la poca, el momento histrico en que vivan... Lastimosamente, muchos no conocen las biblias de estudio (que traen explicaciones culturales e histricas, antecedentes de los autores, etc.) y dejan las respuestas a gente que hace ese tipo de comentarios como el que te dieron.    Este tipo de prohibiciones sobre las formas ha hecho terrible da?o a la gente de buena voluntad y de sentido comn. Y ha esparcido la imagen de un Dios antiptico que vive para darte una lista de prohibiciones y amenazas. Este tipo de cosas es como el cncer de los cristianos.    Pens en esto: Todo el propsito de Jess fue allanar el camino, acortar las distancias entre la divinidad y los seres humanos. Y muchos lderes religiosos se empe?an en hacer este camino intransitable, pesado y frustrante.

HIMwyeZqaa	Babies and young children usually spend a lot more time with their mothers than with their dads.  So when she starts to give some attention to dad or the family pet or anyone else on a regular basis, then child may see them as competition for their mom's attention.  I'm sure the same happens with daughters but it has a different look than two males and one of them jealous.  Why get married at all?  Because we are taught that is the norm.  We may copy what we have learned even to the point that we find a look alike to one of our parents.  I would also say that people who live together pick up a lot of body and face language from one another to the point of eventually looking like brother and sister.|`|GPznIhzMaa	I think it exists to a certain extent. In the story, Oedipus married his mother by accident. Sigmund Freud's Oedipus Complex says that a son will vie for his mother's attention because of sexual tensions.

Addition:    Here is another from a 1922 speech:    "My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter."

In fact, he hated Christians, though he disguised it for the first number of years that he was in power.  By WWII, when there were Nazi-sponsored pagan flower ceremonies during important solar dates, he'd stopped pretending.  He loathed Christianity because it wasn't "Aryan" to him.  It was something from outside the German race, and therefore it should be extinguished.    He wanted to found an "Aryan" neopagan religion based upon nature worship, and he was already beginning to target Christians for the concentration camps at the time that WWII ended.  If he'd been given 50 more years, he would have attempted to wipe out Christians as he did the Jews.|`|AA11486247	On March 23, 1933, [Hitler] addressed the Reichstag: "The National Government regards the two Christian confessions (i.e. Catholicism and Protestantism) as factors essential to the soul of the German people. ... We hold the spiritual forces of Christianity to be indispensable elements in the moral uplift of the German people."    There ya go.    In this article, it mentions his Roman Catholic background. He was actually raised Christian and used that to gain power. He may have not been a non-practicing Christian, but did believe in God. However, his ties to Christianity would label him as a Christian.    Also to note, he wasn't an atheist and he opposed any official state religion. He was probably pro-evolution, but it really doesn't say anything about evolution itself. I mean, "evil" people have used the bible to support things such as racism or sexism, but that in no way represents the bible itself.|`|9ce6c491f43dd1efd859b2c62eebf971aa	What next ????

tyeCsbk1aa	You're asking for definition and etymology.    Well, February, as you probably know, is the second month of the Gregorian calendar. It ultimately comes from Latin "februum", or purification, after a ritual held during that month in the Roman calendar.    A daiquiri is a cocktail made from rum, lime juice, and syrup. The word comes from the rum-producing district of Daiquiri (in Cuba).    Victuals just means foods or provisions. It comes from Latin, victus, which means "food or livelihood." It is unrelated to the word victor, which is derived from the Latin vic- ("Veni, vidi, vici").    A gauge is a measuring device of some sort, like a pressure gauge for instance. I can't find its etymology, but if I had to take a guess I'd say it's French in origin.    And finally, a memento is a souvenir. And like so many fancy words in English, it comes from Latin. In this case, the word memento literally means "remember" (souvenirs are meant as a reminder of an experience or trip).
I7kYdVF8aa	well the french dont really have a term for hang out because they're well...french so i can understand why there are many translations for it  but most commonly you would just go with the term " to be with my friends and learn new things"   which would be  etre (accent on that) avec mes amis et apprende nouveau choses    for ending the paragraph just make a general summary of your life like in english  "my life is very fun but busy" or something cheesy xD|`|3urQfMffaa	A l'ecole, j'aime crecher avec mes amies et apprende nouveau choses.|`|xGmbEzOZaa	"Hang out" is an exclusively English expression, so there's not really a translation in French.    You could say " l'cole j'aime passer mon temps libre avec mes amis et j'aime apprendre des nouvelles choses."    To end the paragraph, you can talk about what you do with your friends during school and what do you enjoy learning the most about.|`|b9fXwehraa	crcher: to hang out  are you sure you want to use slang? tra?ner sounds good...  http://www.languagerealm.com/french/fren...|`|GZkUxstWaa	"Au collge j'aime tra?ner avec mes copains et j'aime apprendre des nouvelles choses".     Maybe you could say who's in your family, what you do in your free time, what school subjects you enjoy the most, what your favourite holiday was, or something like that. Just some ideas...

ytiw1UXiaa	The most important thing, a super romantic card and a super cute stuffed animal, you can go it for around $10.00!  I always keep my silly stuffed animals and cherish them!|`|IPiddfD1aa	I would get her a single red rose and an adorable card or poem. Plus a $120 dollar dinner!!! She'll never forget it!|`|gsw5uCw4aa	i think a $120 dinner she'll remember, but if you want to get her a gift on top of that you could get her a nice gold necklace with a simple charm.  a gold chain could run $15. and a pendant could cost under that.|`|X6R9XrR1aa	She will love your dinner (trust me).|`|fXtLRYZ8aa	If you are really looking for a UNIQUE gift idea, maybe you can look into taking a couples massage class together!    I don't know what region you reside in, but if you happen to live near Dallas or the DFW Metroplex, then you may be interested in the COUPLES-MASSAGE CLASS which is taught at Sterling Health Center Massage School every year.    It is a six (6) hour course on that Saturday from 10am-4pm and by the end of the day, all couples should feel comfortable giving a full-hor massage like a pro and without injuring themselves or getting tired!    Its such a fun class and very popular with the Dallas locals who know!  But if you dont live in Dallas, its still worth the search to find a similar class nearby that teaches couples or pairs (such as mother/daughter, etc) how to give a good massage.     Basically, during half of the class you will be massaging your partner and during the other half, yout parner will be massaging you.  It is a unique gift that everybody loves and you can bet that anyone receiving the gift will never forget it!    For anyone interested in enrolling in the Couples Massage Class in Dallas, they can either logon to http://www.sterlinghealthcenter.com or http://www.sterlingdayspa.com or call the massage school directly at +1(972)991-9292 .    I hope this helps! Good luck and Happy Valentines Day to you in advance!|`|AA10392223	yeah so i know that's expensive dinner!  I would get her liles they are cheap and unique not so cliche.  I would love a teddy bear cause i have something that i can keep rather than chocolate that will get eaten or a flower that will die.  teddy bears aren't super expensive write her a poem or make her a card.
8MzVCzi0aa	because you are not truly happy where you at|`|3cLA6wCWaa	It's human nature to long for simpler times especially if they were happy times. Even if we currently have all the superficial elements of success our hearts know there is more to life.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	The grass is always greener. I've moved back to a place only to just get tired of the same old stuff that made me want to leave in the first place. If you like visiting, keep it that way. I wouldn't move to New Orleans if you paid me, not before, not now either.     If you are unhappy, don't look at where it is you live. That can't be the solution.|`|yynC47EMaa	Have you heard about all of the killings that are going down in New Orleans lately? The thugs have even taken over the 7th ward. People are being robbed and shot even in the French Quarter. That knuckle head Nagin is till in charge and the city government is more corrupt than ever. Where you gonna live if you move back down dea, where are you going to get a job? The job market was never right in N.O. can you imagine how jacked up it is now? If you go back down there, sure you will have a good time for a lil bit, get you a poboy or two, some crawfish, red beans and rice and Jamabalaya. go to the Zulu parade drink some hurricanes but c'mon girl! You know that chit will get old quick!  You and I both know there is no place in the country like N.O., other people just don't get it but the old N.O. is not what it used to be. La bon temp! St. Aug High School purple knights.|`|F5bT2wAraa	First I introduce myself.  I am some one who believes that we are not our bodies.  We are spirit souls within these bodies (like hands in gloves).  As spirit souls we all have personalities.  The super soul has an incarnation in each and every one of our hearts (like two birds sitting on a branch).  Your spirit soul may be a family person.  Or you may be too attached to the place you were born in for reasons coming from your past lives.  You are born with that and you may always remain like that.  However there is a way that you can have your longings satisfied without moving back.  I assure you of that because I have been in the same situation that you are right now.  If your soul is suffering from something, it is because the Karma you bring in with you in to this world from your past lives, every one has that.  It has nothing to do with the place you live in.  Time is an element too.  Each and every one of us lives in now.  You can not bring the past back no matter how much you long for it, because you are living in this temporary material world where time rules.    The way I got over it was by chanting.  Have you ever heard of chanting before?  By chanting your heart feels at home.  Eternal home that does not have anxiety, fear, hunger and thirst.  If you would like to know more, simply email me.  Chanting is really safe and practical.  It can be done in a group and that makes it more fun.  It does not need a lot of time.

t2rUhyANaa	"J'aime avoir des bonnes notes sans effort" or   "J'aime avoir des bonnes notes facilement" or  "J'aime avoir des A sans trop d'effort"  "J'aime avoir des A sans effort"    "Pour rien", means for nothing ie for no good reason.    Whether or not you say "A" or "bonnes notes" is dependent on the situation. If you are referring to yourself in you class in which you are graded using a letter system it is quite acceptable to use "A".|`|81bda06b67f3aa041e733ff5f2351395aa	J'aime obtenir des A sans effort.|`|qm1EJgmWaa	yea, i think that is right!|`|M6U7jVoQaa	J'aime marquer des As sans peine    i am not native French, but i live there|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	J'aime recevoir de bonnes notes sans faire aucun effort!|`|EHozsofQaa	I would say: "J'aime avoir des A sans faire d'efforts."  or "J'aime avoir des bonnes notes sans faire d'efforts."
WuhIoS1laa	Would that be the woodchuck poo problem, or the stain in the minivan problem?    I guess it doesn't matter. You are asking advice on Y!A, and will often get stupid suggestions from people that don't care one way or another what you really do.     I would NOT have told mom how the stain got there, or just said a friend got sick (but left out the sex part) and the woodchuck poo, after having asked the owner to stop and he didn't - would have been delivered to the owner's front door.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Good grief...no. That`s cyber stalking, it`s just like road rage.|`|5AaiBmU0aa	No, that's a risk you take when you seek advice over the internet.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	That's a toughie.  I mean you're entitled to start a conversation, but I wouldn't be accusing about it.  It's not like we come here w/ our university degrees showing, ya know?|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	What would be the point, exactly?    If it's that you think they should know it didn't work, so they won't give the same advice in the future, as long as you keep it polite, then, OK.    If you want to yell at them, or if you should have realized the advice was bad, then no.    After all, it was YOU who decided to take the advice; if it was to do something you shouldn't do, then you have to take your lumps.|`|yynC47EMaa	No, you put your trust in a stranger and you got played, it's a very common story. Learn to be self sufficient and rely on your own judgement.|`|5oNwMqMiaa	Whoaa, that's an interesting situation.  I guess it depends what it was about.  Why would you want to contact the advice giver?  Do you want to, in some way, apportion some of the blame to them?  Ultimately, you made the decision to follow the advice so it's down to you....and they were answering a question that was posted by you, with your spin on it.  But I also feel for you because now you feel like you're in a difficult situation.  What will you get from telling the advice giver where their answer lead you?  I think you have to think about what you want from the situation honey....they can't make it better for you.  Good luck :-)
WVPYem5Vaa	Best thing to do: ignore her completely, and give her no reason to try and yell at you. If she does, ignore it completely, and just think, "What a loser, having to pick on me like that." If the harassment continues, reply to it some time in a *very* indignant manner and show her that you're not afraid to stand up for yourself, but only do that as a last resort.|`|8nvesSFFaa	I was in this situation in 6th grade.  For the first semester my English teacher did like me and then the second half she hated me. She is exactly like your teacher too. She put on Friday the movie for us!!! Just completely ignore her first but if the harassment continues I suggest you take it up to the adminastration.  :)|`|JZdwV01saa	talk to someone about it|`|A7mAUaxgaa	This is a very hard situation.  Are you sure she is "picking" on you?  I know that sometimes a teacher (or authority figure) will be harder on someone they expect more from.  It doesn't make sense I know, but I'm willing to bet that your teacher actually sings your praises outside of the classroom.      Your other teacher was right, don't let her get to you.  Know that the teacher is there to help you not only learn the stuff that they are teaching, but to become a better adult. :D|`|eAzq2N9raa	throw a pencil in her eye
FyHaU0D6aa	Greenlandic is an example of a language that inflects according to both subject. Example: takuakkit (I see you), takuara (I see him), takuat (you see him), takuaa (he sees him/her/it), takuvassigut (you [pl.] see us), etc. The root is taku-.    Another example is Hungarian: szeretlek (I love you), ltlak (I see you), etc.      I dont know examples of languages that inherently conjugate verbs according to gender, though many (all?) Slavic languages conjugate the past tense of verbs according to gender rather than persons. Examples:  (I/you/he ran),  (I/you/she ran),  (it ran).
MPX0f5jzaa	I like your maturity and I think you're on the right track.  The truth is that if you really want someone to be quiet, you definitely do have to take it up with them yourself.  Telling the RA is like hiding behind him/her, and you know that'll never work, they won't respect you and heed your wishes.    I don't think knocking on the wall is a good idea because again, it's impersonal and gives the impression of hiding while you complain.  I would face them and tell them it's ridiculous.  When the volume goes up again, tell the RA... again.  When nothing is done, call your campus' housing authority and report them all including the RA.    This is detrimental to your studies and ridiculously in violation of what an institution of higher learning is supposed to be.  Best of luck to you!|`|WVPYem5Vaa	They are being superbly obnoxious, meaning you don't need permission to be the same, especially after you tried talking to them.|`|ycNt74yyaa	Definitely knock on the wall and if they get rowdier go and knock on their door and try to reason with them. If they aren't reasonable, call the landlord or some other authority to help. Good luck!|`|prW1i0vzaa	You are not getting out of line. Your college should do something about that.    Loud Noise=Interruptions=Difficult to Study=Grades Dropping=Trouble in Education    Anything that is giving you trouble in education should be reported. I'm sorry to hear the RA won't do anything. Maybe you could see if you could stay with one of your friends that are in a separate dorm?    You are not getting out of line. Though, I wouldn't knock on the wall. They are not going to listen to you.    Does your college even allow alcohol? If it isn't, that should be reported too.|`|OPKbGXUFaa	If they're freshman, it means they are 18 or 19, which is under the legal drinking age, if you get desperate, just report them to your dorm administrator.|`|JZdwV01saa	talk to them again or knock on there wall if it works i not get some one esle invovled|`|mnEkv7xdaa	If it's impacting your home life, it's impacting your education. Basically they're f-ing you up in school. You would not be out of line to knock on the wall, walk over and tell them off, or to speak to housing and get your room switched immediately. Don't doubt yourself - screw them - you do what you need to do. Nobody's going to stand up for you - you have to do it yourself. Good luck.|`|eAzq2N9raa	why dont you try getting friends...|`|8tqQXcp4aa	I agree with the poster who said to tell those girls to shut up first, if they do not consider. Then tell the RA, if she or he doesn't consider either, report all of them. You are at school to learn, not the party 8-) Lord have mercy.     Your parents are giving you an damn good education, and all you do is f-ing party, and get drunk? Wow. I see a future of homeless adults, and IQ's of 5, and single mothers.|`|U1LknLaWaa	Seriously you need to man and shut those girls up.|`|u7bxSrtKaa	good lord!  maybe if you started to drink a little, they might invite you over.  who says they are moving furniture, and fighting?  i think its more likely since they are drunk that they are into some s & m.      my kinda girls.|`|fFObxgxuaa	dude...grow a pair.    if you don't like partying then you should not live on campus.

hHjPFxEdaa	Sometimes people laugh at something that makes them uncomfortable. It's really hard to say without an actual example. As for them not laughing at your jokes, well..maybe they're not funny.

swkhohjgaa	Youre doing the right ting to start as soon as possible with transitioning.     Your parents may be different. But often the parents, like many other straight people just cant get past the idea that this condition is a choice that you have made.     The anger is more likely due to their idea that they failed somehow as parents. They can feel helpless and frustrated.    Being calm under fire is the best way to be. As long as there is communication there is hope. At 18 youre at their good will financially so be careful.      Without being condescending you must take the role of teacher. Teach them what they need to know so they understand that this is the best and only direction for you.

Help would be easier if we knew more about what you look like.|`|gkoX68Awaa	Are you seeing a therapist yet ? The transition from one gender to the other generally requires counseling prior to any operation.    If so, you should be asking your therapist how you can approach your family.    I approached mine by screwing up and accidentally making a very public post that I could not retract. Yes, it was awful yes, it was painful, but in the end, it certainly made my life a LOT easier. It also showed me my family was more behind me than I thought. All in all, the best thing that happened was my family and me talking it out.|`|lL5lKNIiaa	Wow you are very brave to go through wat you are going through. Lately the human race has really been letting me down and your bravery is encouraging. I know that being gay alone is scary at times but you are taking it to the next step and that is amazing. The only advice I think that I can give you (being that I am a girl and always have been) is just keep your head up and stay proud of who you are once you are no matter what gender you are, what you look like or anything. good luck and I am sorry about your family not supporting how brave you are.

AA10686104	some of the most interesting ghost stories I know happened in a house that was pretty new, and only family members had lived in it (my uncles and grandfather built it). but after my uncle moved in, an old woman he did some work for gave him a rocking chair...it was an antique, but in good condition...but it would rock when no one was in it, or near it, and no wind or anything blowing it. My mother stayed there once in an upstairs guest room, and a little girl walked in with long hair and a long nightgown...my mom thought at first it was my younger cousin, but she had leg problems and had to wear a brace at night that held her ankles straight, and couldn't climb the stairs. Mom got up to go to the girl and she walked out of the room, down the stairs and disappeared...and she checked, and Lisa and I were sound asleep in the bed in her room.  There was another incident that happened when my uncle was there by himself, that involved a cabinet door opening, something falling out and rolling across the floor, and down the basement steps, only to crash on the basement floor...my uncle heard all this, and when he went to look, it was one of those extra big ball canning jars full of canned cabbage....only they didn't have any canned cabbage in their cabinet, or that type of jar...maybe a hundred years ago, there had been another house on that sight, and the ghosts were from it...or maybe they came with the chair?|`|AA12108965	My daughter was leaving my Mom's house.

AA11119479	I was around in the '60s, but don't remember this particular Alpha-Bits ad.     I remember another Alpha-Bits ad, though. This was a '70s ad, and there were kids spelling out the letters of imaginary creatures that were coming to get them, and then they'd eat the letters, and the scary thing would away. One time, that ad was playing, and a relative of mine was totally wrecked on medication after having come home from the hospital. In the ad, one of the kids said something like, "Help! There's an alligator!" and the animated TV kids started spelling out the letters with Alpha-Bits. Suddenly, my relative bellowed, "Don't worry, kids, I'll save you!" And then he blew away the TV set with a shotgun. True story.    Just wanted to say that I've been looking for your ad, and haven't found it yet. I'm afraid that I might not be able to find it.

In Ephesians and in Romans we have passages referring to the "two becoming one" speaking of the jews and the gentiles. That is what the new covenant is about. Passages from the NT that refer to this including of the gentiles are Romans 11 and Ephesians 3, among others.       Some O.T. references that speak about the inclusion of the gentiles into what what was previously "jews only", include the following:  Psalm 18:49, Deuteronomy 32:43, Psalm 117:1, and Isaiah 11:10.     Then there are, of course, the scriptures in the O.T. about Jesus being rejected by his own people, among which are:  Psalm 118:22 and Isaiah 53:1 & 3.    The NT is most assuredly in effect, but it is taking time for all the elements within it to work out, as people learn of Jesus and work out their salvation step by step and are changed into His likeness from glory to glory...(Phillipians 2:12 & 2 Corinthians 3:18) It's the process whereby the Law of God is placed in their hearts and in their inward parts.     And then someday there shall be a pure language with which to call upon and serve the Lord, the name of God shall be one, and no longer will neighbor teach neighbor "know the Lord" for all shall know Him from the greatest to the least.

This talks about the coming savior, the one who is to be called Jesus, God's son. The savior of the world who bore our sins and transgressions. He shed his blood on the cross as a sacrificial  lamb for you and me. All that is expected of us is to believe he is our savior,  ask forgiveness and follow him.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Romans 11:20-21|`|4eb65c12497840f599500825222da691aa	Ok, go back to Genesis.    Here you will find that God told Abraham that he would be the father of all nations.  Abrahams seed is the line of the chosen ones.    Now jump ahead to the new testament and see where the reference is made to Abraham and his seed and that we all can be "grafted in" and adopted into the seed of Abraham.    It was not that the Israelites rejected Jesus Christ , so God said, allrighty then, let the gentiles in on the party.    Gods plan all along was to redeem all, and you can find this promise back in the beginning in Genesis again.  God told Eve that her seed would produce a cure or salvation for the sin they had committed.  That seed would crush the head of saten and in doing so would bruise his heel.    There were no gentiles or Israelites yet, God made this promise to all.    Now, onto results.  Remember the seed that God said would come and "cure us" that he told Eve about?  That seed was Jesus Christ.  Eve was just like us, at the birth of her first born, Cain, she thought God gave her the seed that would save her from her sin.  She was wrong and impatiient for results.    We are no different, we are impatient about waiting for anything.  Many people died in the old testament times waiting for the redeemder to come.  They died knowing that he wasnt here yet, but yet still believing he was coming.    We live in the age of grace, Jesus has been here and done what needed to be done to make us sinless in Gods eyes.  Now we are no longer waiting for the Messiah, we are waiting for the end of times to play out.  We are just as impatient as Eve was, we look to everyone who comes into power , wondering if they could be the anti christ and so on.    We must remain patient, it was much longer than any human thought in old testament times for the Messiah to come and it could be even longer for the end of times to finish up.    It will happen as with all things, in Gods timing and not in ours.  It is not a Christian contradiction, it is most simply put that we must remain patient.|`|AA11110297	Read your other posts - Your response To Christian...I was a Christian for 35 years, Jesus's promises were bunk.

You must of had extraordinary intelligence... being one year of age when you accepted the Lord as Savior.|`|AA11277067	God is in Control of Our Salvation Ephesians 1:3-14              Gods sovereignty extends over all things. Because He is omnipotent (all powerful), no plan of His can be stopped (Luke 1:37). He is also omniscient (all knowing), so nothing is hidden from His sight (Hebrews 4:13). Whats more, He is omnipresent, which means that all things exist in His presence (Psalm 33:13-15; Colossians 1:16-17). Everything in both the natural and spiritual realms  including our salvation  are under His complete control.              The Scriptures describe mankind as having hearts that are deceitful (Jeremiah 17:9), minds that suppress truth (Romans 1:18-19), and wills that have turned away from the Lord (Isaiah 53:6). God, however, is continually seeking us. Hes issued a universal call inviting everyone to freely come to Him (John 3:16). He has declared it isnt His will that anyone perish (2 Peter 3:9), nor does He take pleasure in the death of the wicked. (Ezekiel 33:11). He desires that all come to a knowledge of the truth  namely, that there is just one God, sin separates us from Him, and only faith in Jesus reconciles us to Him (1 Timothy 2:4-6).              But Scripture teaches that none of us seek God (Romans 3:11); we can take no credit for our salvation. The desire to know Him comes through the Spirits work of convicting hearts of sinfulness and providing the faith to believe in Jesus as Savior (Ephesians 2:8). Salvation is all of God from first to last.              The heavenly Father chose a people for Himself from among the ungodly (Ephesians 1:11 NIV; Romans 4:5). Ask the Holy Spirit to help you grasp the immensity of divine grace, love, and mercy.    .Gods Sovereignty and the Existence of Evil  Genesis 2:7-3:24  Throughout the Bible, we see evidence of Gods authority over both humanity and nature. However, we have trouble reconciling Gods sovereign control with the existence of evil. What does Scripture tell us?  In the beginning, God created a perfect world, in which He declared that all He had made was good (Genesis 1:31). Wickedness was not part of what He had fashioned. In the heavens, however, an angel known as Satan sought to elevate himself above God and was cast down to earth (Isaiah 14:12).  God created Adam and Eve in His image. They were made with the capacity to love their Creator and the ability to choose to obey or disobey Him. God had no desire for Adam and Eve to sin (James 1:13), but He allowed their wills to be tested. We know the rest of the story. When they disobeyed God, sin entered our world and corrupted mankind. As Adam and Eves descendants, we inherited the flesh nature (Romans 5:12).  The Lords permissive will allowed events to unfold as they have. God did not create evil, but He has permitted it to exist and uses it to accomplish His good purposes (Isaiah 45:6-7).  When you have questions or doubts about Gods sovereignty, start with what you do understand, study what God has revealed about Himself and His ways, and ask the Holy Spirit to help you believe. A few answers to your questions will come quickly, while some will require diligent study and spiritual maturity. For others, which God has chosen to keep hidden (Deuteronomy 29:29), we are to walk by faith.     .

La Eucarista: Nos Guarda del Pecado    ?Tiene la Eucarista el poder de purificar a los catlicos de los pecados cometidos y de protegerlos de futuros pecados?     "Por eso la Eucarista no puede unirnos a Cristo sin purificarnos al mismo tiempo de los pecados cometidos y preservarnos de futuros pecados" (p. 399,  1393).     "Por la misma caridad que enciende en nosotros, la Eucarista nos preserva de futuros pecados mortales" (p. 399,  1395).     Una vez ms, las ense?anzas de la Palabra de Dios y de la tradicin catlica son completamente diferentes. Respecto a la purificacin de los pecados pasados, la Biblia declara que todos los pecados son limpiados por medio de la sangre de Jesucristo:     "... la sangre de Jesucristo su Hijo nos limpia de todo pecado".  1 Juan 1:7     "Y de Jesucristo, el testigo fiel... Al que nos am, y nos lav de nuestros pecados con su sangre". Apocalipsis 1:5     El Catecismo le quita a Cristo el crdito de ser el nico que puede purificar a las personas de sus pecados, y le atribuye esa capacidad a una hostia. ?Por qu es rebajado Jess nuevamente?     "Y esto erais algunos; mas ya habis sido lavados, ya habis sido santificados, ya habis sido justificados en el nombre del Se?or Jess, y por el Espritu de nuestro Dios". 1 Corintios 6:11     La Eucarista protege de pecados futuros    En ningn lugar de la Biblia se ense?a que comer un trozo de pan guardar a la persona de cometer pecados futuros. La nica funcin prctica de esta doctrina es hacer que la gente vuelva a la Iglesia Catlica para recibir la Eucarista, con la esperanza de que les ayude a no caer en pecado.     Aparte de mantener a la gente en sujecin a la iglesia, esta prctica no logra ningn otro resultado.     Vemos as que esta doctrina no se basa en la Palabra de Dios. Sin embargo, sta nos dice cmo podemos protegernos del pecado:     "En mi corazn he guardado tus dichos, para no pecar contra ti".  Salmos 119:11     "?Con qu limpiar el joven su camino? Con guardar tu palabra".  Salmos 119:9     Para protegerse del pecado, Dios sugiere que lea, memorice y obedezca la Biblia. Curiosamente, la Iglesia Catlica no concuerda con esta ense?anza. Al parecer, los lderes catlicos prefieren que usted acuda a la iglesia en busca de ayuda, en vez de acudir a la Palabra de Dios.     A usted le toca determinar cul es el motivo:     "Jehov te guardar de todo mal...".Salmos 121:7     "T eres mi refugio; me guardars de la angustia; con cnticos de liberacin me rodears. Selah". Salmos 32:7     "Y el Se?or me librar de toda obra mala, y me preservar para su reino celestial. A l sea gloria por los siglos de los siglos. Amn". 2 Timoteo 4:18     Conclusin    Para purificarlo de pecados del pasado y protegerlo de pecados futuros, el catolicismo demanda que usted dependa de un trozo de pan.     Es imperativo que comprenda que esta tradicin de hombres contradice directamente a la Palabra de Dios. Para obedecer esta doctrina catlica, usted debe rechazar las Sagradas Escrituras.     ?Realmente desea hacerlo?     "Y a aquel que es poderoso para guardaros sin cada, y presentaros sin mancha delante de su gloria con gran alegra, al nico y sabio Dios, nuestro Salvador, sea gloria y majestad, imperio y potencia, ahora y por todos los siglos. Amn."

Se vuoi una mia opinione, credo che i media in Italia cerchino molte volte di creare un clima di terrore e di impaurire la gente.  Un esempio: quando nell'estate 2005 c'era stato un incidente aereo, su un volo charter dalla Puglia verso il Marocco (nn mi ricordo bene la destinazione, cmq nordafrica), in seguito tutti i telegiornali riportavano notizie di incidenti aerei da tutti gli angoli del mondo. Sentivo che le persone dicevano: oddio, stanno cadendo un sacco di aerei, volare  pericoloso, ecc ecc  A me ha sempre dato l'idea di montatura, ovvio che nel mondo succedano un sacco di incidenti.....

Leicester does have a large ethnic population but nowhere near those figures. there are Asian communities as well as Polish and Somalian communities which just goes to show what a diverse and welcoming attitude the Leicester people have.   the mixture of races and cultures also has a good effect on the city itself and there has been a lot of regeneration because of it.   Leicester is a great place to live in all aspects everybody seems willing to help out where they can and there is still a lot of old school respect around, there are great shopping centres in and out of the city centre, plenty of places to eat with lots of choice on what cuisine you want to eat and great nightlife too.  the universities attract people from all over the world and the national space centre is also based here.   there is far too much for me to mention on here lol  but i enjoy living in Leicester and i am proud of it.|`|GHefTsUyaa	No idea where that is,sorry.|`|XTlV0Crxaa	i dont live there but leicester sounds good|`|8ut0e6BDaa	Sounds great.|`|GrZ9BO3Zaa	buzzin'

('host' referring to those who occupy heaven and earth - including angels).  Exodus 20:11 repeats, "in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them".    Nehemiah reasserts that God made them in 9:6, "You are the LORD, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you."    Psalm 148 says this:       1 Praise the LORD. [a]         Praise the LORD from the heavens,         praise him in the heights above.     2 Praise him, all his angels,         praise him, all his heavenly hosts.     3 Praise him, sun and moon,         praise him, all you shining stars.     4 Praise him, you highest heavens         and you waters above the skies.     5 Let them praise the name of the LORD,         for he commanded and they were created.   (esp 2+5)    So, there's no question Biblically that God created the angels, in the first days of creation (of heaven and earth, Genesis 1+2).    I want to correct something another poster said, though.  Jesus WAS NOT created.  Jesus is God with the Father and the Holy Spirit.  John 1:1 says that Jesus (the Word) was with God and WAS God in the beginning... and before the beginning... eternally from before the beginning to after the end, Jesus (God the Son), God the Father, and God the Holy Spirit are ONE.  The poster is correct, however, in saying that God created together.  Father, Son and Holy Spirit were each active in creation.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Colossians 1:14-16  God created Jesus first his only begotten son then together they created everything else including the angels.|`|AA12288361	Yes.    Speaking of Satan:    Ezekiel 28:14 ?Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.  15 ?Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.    Satan was one of GOD's highest ranking angels. He was created as the texts describe.    GOD bless|`|yHfsHp6naa	They came from the same place god did: A man's imagination.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	The Bible is a narrative. It doesn't include anything that isn't important to telling the story. It's not some Wikipedia designed to satisfy idle wandering curiosity.|`|2QuGuphYaa	Anaheim.|`|mQmOqcwJaa	God created everything, which means He created angels too. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, which means He always was and is the only thing that has always existed.|`|b94573ef3c2d94b3f4ddd867c8a6cc47aa	The only record that Christians have is the Bible..|`|vprXuK2Kaa	there is a solid record of their creation, they are an organized baseball team...

Angels, like us, are his children. Record of creation is in the Bible.
654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	My dad taught me, when I was a little girl, that only a firm handshake and a direct look into the eye of the person whose hand I was shaking would do.    That piece of advice was golden, and right-on.  It has served me well; I have shaken the hand of many people in my life, including Senators, several American presidents, authors, actors, business men & women and out of all those famous folks only one woman, whom I shall not name, shook hands with me in that "limp fish' way that made me want to flinch, and then go wash my hands.    I value that piece of advice from Dad, and though he wasn't alive by the time they were born, I taught my two sons to shake hands long before they were out of diapers.  It is rare to see teen boys offer a hand these days, but I can almost see my dad nodding his approval every time I witness them perform the ritual.|`|HArruZLJaa	A firm one.|`|VncSMLMpaa	A firm handshake but not a bone cruncher.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	A regal handshake, very gently|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Probably too firm for a female.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Firm not the "iron glove but certainly not the "limp wet fish".     Handshakes originated as a greeting of trust. using the right or sword hand to show the person was unarmed or meant no malice. Barristers don't shake hands these days as traditionally they did not carry swords.|`|7jM9Ghchaa	yes me too firm meaning full and friendly to show welcome and friendship?also great manners|`|hXQnR2Scaa	A firm handshake is a gentleman's handshake.    That is what people should expect and what you should give.|`|BZzarKRSaa	um it depends if you were in a workforce it is good to have a firm handshake, but if you are shaking a grils hand go easy, believe i no also i meen does it madder that much, i meen its you people should like it|`|AnhoHRFTaa	I give a firmish hand shake, but bend my middle finger so that it touches the palm of the other person and then slide my middle finger back and forth.

When we meet in this place, the ego is not invited to join us there.  All blessings...    i am Sirius|`|8ut0e6BDaa	A firm one.

If it's a woman, I'll shake her hand gently, without any imposition.  If it's a man, a firmer handshake is usually expected- why, I don't know.  But, then, I pride myself on my ability to be a gentleman in any circumstance and I have learned which handshakes work best in the situation.  I always ignore their looks.    Does this sound too devious to you?|`|J83rL9SJaa	the impression you want to put forward to the person you are hand shaking should vary the type of hand shake you give.|`|RLqmrHlIaa	I give bone-crusher handshakes too. Better to give a bone-crusher handshake than a dead fish handshake. Yuck!

dZCHmMroaa	Statisticians calculated that trust is 9 times harder to make than break.    Testing each other will drive you to the point of insanity/hatred. Just live your lives normally, trust will grow better in an environment in which you aren't both trying to trip each other up. People aren't perfect and testing might just let you see something you don't particularly want to|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Once trust is broken it cant be mended.|`|N73oZyY8aa	I don't think so, I think it's more like game playing.|`|OsxQNDHzaa	Testing your relationship is a sign of serious problems.    Well. in my opinion anyway!!  :@)|`|lKatwNsfaa	You don't mention why the trust was broken in the first place? If he or she was unfaithful to you, then be very careful. The chances are it will happen again.    Even if it doesn't, the fact you are asking about testing them to mend the trust, sounds as if the relationship is rocky.    If you set them up with a test, and they fail it, you would have to own up to the fact that you decieved them, which makes you no better than them for cheating on you. And if they didn't cheat on you, you must keep that a secret for the whole of your relationship.    It's playing with fire either way. Either forgive and forget their indescretions or move on.|`|M6PsYn56aa	No dont i did this it turned absoloutley awful in the end he caught me watching them behind a tree in my pj's i was firstly crawling along a main road path behind a wall he coudn't see me but unforunaltly everyone passing by did haha then i got stopped because a lady thought i had mental health issues and i asked a randomer to cause a distraction behind them so they'd turn around and i could leg it from behind a wall to in the park and behind a tree it worked until he caught me pearing round came over to me, i screamed and ran off then he was F'ing and blinding and it sort of got screwed.. DONT DO IT... the guilt..

So I got another one so I can answer questions from those who block me.|`|fHNOiZP0aa	I've done things that other people might consider crazy, but I'm not ashamed of them.  I usually tell people up front that I've done something if they're talking down on it.  1) Because it shocks them, "how could someone I thought so highly of do that?" and 2) Because if I am confident about my actions, perhaps I could help those people get a more rounded viewpoint on it.|`|DJLeObm4aa	There are about 2 things in my life I regret doing.  I think I wouldn't mind revealing these things. However, if there is someone else involved in your secret(s) as in mine I don't think I have the right to expose another party. Therefore sometimes much as a person considers 'to hell with what anyone thinks' it is not always so straightforward.|`|JIATcwW6aa	Not me.  I am very good at keeping my mouth shut when it best suits the situation, or me.      I am good at keeping secrets, both my own and those of others!|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I had an interesting experience with this subject a while back.  I went to a city council meeting and asked that the metal fence be replaced with chain link so people driving by could see our beautiful grand stands, football field and fair buildings. Saying, that many people passing by think  the metal fence is hiding a junk yard.  I also suggested they sell the metal fence to off set the expense of the new fence.     It took a few years but the council did as I had suggested and it made a world of difference to the city and those passing through on M 66.      About 12 years later when the new generation of adults took over the political process in my city/town, a man who was a youngster when I made my wishes known to the council, now and adult, had the nerve to say it was all his families idea and patted himself on the back. I gave him a call and asked him to go back through the minutes of the meetings of the city council and then he would know that I made the Speech before a full house of citizens for this fence. Dosen' mean much to others but to me it does, I was/am proud of what I did for my town. For others to take the credit for my work was wrong.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Got no idea what that would be.  But I've done many things and have got a bit of a reputation around town (due to acting). Complaining in the letters to the editor.  If what they saying is good or bad, I could not care less.  Peace.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	Yes.  When I was working in a centre for asylum seekers, an Afghan was transferred to the centre on Friday afternoon. I'm only little and he was a huge bear of a man. He was grumpy and kept muttering  to himself. The only word I understood was 'Isvicre'. However, he did understand English. I said, 'If I could understand what you are saying about Switzerland, I would probably be annoyed.'  Foreseeing problems for the young colleague who was working in the centre at the weekend, I poked the guy in the chest and said, 'You're Nazim.' I then pointed to myself and said, 'I'm the boss.'  I then held out my hand to him. He held out his hand, but, knowing that some Muslims don't shake hands with non-Muslims, I grasped his wrist. He smiled and I said, 'OK?'. He nodded.  A couple of years later I heard him, recounting this to a new resident. From what I could gather, he was saying, 'She may be a woman, but she's OK.' Then he looked at me and nodded his head.|`|FZzIZ5GWaa	I don't keep anything a secret. **** whatever people think.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	Boy...I wish!  HA!    Mike talks about how good I am on the computer.

I'm really a relatively boring person and if anyone found the truth out, it would in deed destroy the reputation I have developed over the past year ... then I wouldn't be famous anymore and folks would quit talking about me and I would run out of ideas about what to write about.      No, I've never actually done something that I hear others talking about; and I've already said that to admit such a thing will ruin my reputation ... but then again, it may add to it ... let's see ... this shall be interesting!|`|rZhx3Nwuaa	I got my self new dentures, and I think they look quite nice, see I am smiling, don't you think I am handsome.|`|TFPVelzraa	No good secrets here.|`|M6PsYn56aa	I have SO many secrets it would RUIN my reputation.. well it already has lol, the person that i did.. a few things with?, blabbed it off to everyone and now i have a huge group of loud confident (you know the sort) gobby girls on my case making comments.. i did care.. but its no ones buissness so they can go shove it :)|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	I have several secrets that I treasure.

Last night the driver we had kept yelling "oh my God, whatta jerk" everytime another car cut him off. I dont think thats very nice .. or acceptable."    No one will ever know who was teaching the drivers english but maybe they should stop and ask themselves IF the drivers can understand what they are saying, when they think they cant ... lol    And anonymously, some nice things, I dont do it for the thanks, it makes me feel good.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	yeah, once.  We had some friends that were having a tough time so my husband and I bought them a Christmas tree, decorations and gifts for under it and dropped it of anonimously.  Not a big fancy tree, not lots of decorations and not lots of gifts, just enough so they did not have to go without.  It was an incredible warm fuzzy feeling when my friend called, crying, to tell me about it and I DID NOT tell her who did it.  Someone had done something nice like that for us once too so I have been on both giving and recieving end of doing something someone talked about.  your question almost makes it sound like you are looking for bad things someone has done but I like to think there are more good things than bad out there.

824Md65waa	Sometimes the simplest things are the best.  Maybe you can make a mixed cd of some of his favorite mellow songs, prepare a nice dinner and desert and rent a good movie.

I don't know what region you reside in, but if you happen to live near Dallas or the DFW Metroplex, then you may be interested in the COUPLES-MASSAGE CLASS which is taught at Sterling Health Center Massage School every year.    It is a six (6) hour course on that Saturday from 10am-4pm and by the end of the day, all couples should feel comfortable giving a full-hor massage like a pro and without injuring themselves or getting tired!    Its such a fun class and very popular with the Dallas locals who know!  But if you dont live in Dallas, its still worth the search to find a similar class nearby that teaches couples or pairs (such as mother/daughter, etc) how to give a good massage.     Basically, during half of the class you will be massaging your partner and during the other half, yout parner will be massaging you.  It is a unique gift that everybody loves and you can bet that anyone receiving the gift will never forget it!    For anyone interested in enrolling in the Couples Massage Class in Dallas, they can either logon to http://www.sterlinghealthcenter.com or http://www.sterlingdayspa.com or call the massage school directly at +1(972)991-9292 .

Yeah, I wouldn't have them in heaven.    After all, if you've received all of that and you can't even give pay the lousy $0.75 for a Butterfinger, what does that say about you?

People send themselves to hell by not accepting Jesus Christ as their savior. But, it doesn't matter the severity of the sin it is the fact that they sinned.

Of coarse it is, that is if you agree to the entire christian belief system.  According to them if you don't 'believe' your destination is surely hell.  You can't force belief, so hell is not a chosen destination.  Thankfully hell is all bullshit.  Anyone who disagrees is a stones throw away from needing a white padded room.  You can't tell me the little boy raised to believe in Shiva is going to be punished for eternal life for not changing this belief as a man.  Why would god seriously give a damn.

AA11892617	No. It is a diseased mindset like being a serial killer or a gang member. I am a black, and as such i am considered a minority. i don't have anything against gays, but i do not agree that you can be born like that. People choose to be gay. They let thoughts like that enter their mind and instead of getting rid of them, or thinking of something else, they act on it and choose to lead a lifestyle that is wrong. If men were meant to lie with men, there would be no need for women. It's kinda like choosing to be a prescription drug addict. No one can force you to be as one; nor are people born as addicts.

Epigenetics are related to every thing in your life. From places you go, what you drink, and what you eat, to how many times you scraped your knees or what medicines you have taken. Epigenetics are what turn parts of your DNA on and off, because obviously, not all parts of your DNA are active all the time, in every cell (for instance, parts of your DNA for growing toenails, are not active in your liver).     DNA in twins is the same through out their life, but their epigenetics change. New born twins will have the same epigenetics, by five, there are many differences, and by 13 you would never know that they were twins.|`|kRne2TCeaa	It runs in my family both sides.|`|lCvJHS13aa	Even if you come from a family with several kids, even genetics doesn't mean everyone of the kids are going to be alike.

D4LnRg2Daa	The old testament prophets all prophesied up until the time of John Orchid.  They prophesied about a coming Kingdom that was to be set up and John the Baptist came to announce that this Kingdom was here and to help establish it.  Jesus established this Kingdom.  The law and the prophets lasted until John."  Because the law and prophets all pointed to this Kingdom and had their fulfillment in this Kingdom of God.  If the cousins Jesus and John  had not been successful in establishing this Kingdom all the law and all the prophesies made in the Old Testament concerning it would have become invalid.  If that Kingdom had not have been established it would have spelled the end for Heaven and Earth.  God had no alternative plan, this was it.  Sin was began here on earth and it was here that the final showdown between good and evil took place.  Jesus won that battle on the cross for you and me.  Verse 16 points out the fact that in establishing this kingdom both of its founders, John and Jesus were murdered.  When we accept membership into the Kingdom of God we should never do this without realizing the terrible price they paid for it to become a reality.  Everyone who enters it must realize the violence these men suffered to bring it to a realization.  After it's establishment the violence never stopped and countless Christians since have suffered in the same way so yes your assumption about the martyrs was correct.

Check this out:    DAY 2  PRAY FOR INSIGHT    (a) Read Luke 16:16-17. What all did the Law and the Prophets entail? If the Law and the Prophets were until John, then who is Jesus implying is the starter of a new message? (b) The Kingdom of God is a central theme in Luke. What is the Kingdom of God (Mark 1:15; Acts 1:1-7; Rom 14:16-17)?    (c) The end of 16:16 can be translated in several different ways. Some translations have a phrase similar to everyone forces his way into it (NASB, NIV, ESV) but others have translations such as everyone is forcefully urged to enter it (ESV  [alternate], HCSB, NET). Compare the differences between these two phrases. Which one makes better sense in the context? What do you think it means that everyone forces his way into it (Luke 5:15; Matt. 13:2)? What would the passage mean if it said everyone is forcefully urged to enter it (Matt. 11:28; Matt. 16:24-25)?  (d) Read Luke 24:44-49; Heb 10:1-10. How does the Law function now? Why is it important that the Law would not pass away? (e) The kingdom of God is something that is partially today but will be experienced fully at Christs return. Look up Luke 8:1-15, 10:1-10 13:18-30; 21:29-36; Acts 1:1-7; 28:23-31. According to these passages what is the kingdom of God?     How do we experience it today? When will it be fully realized?  (f) Family: Read Luke 16:16-17. What is the good news talked of (Luke 2:10-11; Matt. 1:21-22)? Explain what the Law is.    Why is it so important that the Law has not passed away?

The Law is the Mosaic Law in force until John--John the Baptist as Matt. 11:13 shows--began his proclaiming the "good news of God's Kingdom".  That is, that the King of that Kingdom, Jesus, was near by.  "Those who enters does so with violence." is more a problem with the particular translation.  That is Matthew 11:12 shows it as the kingdom is the goal that men (and women) go for it earnestly.    Verse 17, "smallest part of the letter" refers to Matthew 5:18  "for truly I say to YOU that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one particle of a letter to pass away from the Law by any means and not all things take place. "  This indicates the Mosaic law would be fulfilled completely.  How?    Matt. 5:17 shows Jesus came to fulfill that Mosaic Law.  That Mosaic Law pointed to the need for Jesus the Messiah by use of umblemished perfect animal sacrifices as the need for forgiveness of sins.  Animal sacrifices though could not forgive sins.  Only the perfect man, Jesus, could by his sacrifice of his perfect human body. (Heb. 10:1-4, 10, 18)    The Law was a tutor to show why we need a Messiah.  Now, with Jesus, we no longer need a tutor as we have the real deal.  (Gal. 3:24-28)    It is not that the Mosaic Law is more important, as it shows the determination that all parts of the Law would be fulfilled by Christ.  That law covenant was ended by Christ's death.  Before he died, he established a new covenant with his faithful followers at Luke 22:28-30.|`|PZKmZ95Yaa	John the Baptist is presented in Luke's gospel as a transitional figure between the period of Israel, the time of promise, and the period of Jesus, the time of fulfillment.

The law and the prophets, &c.  Not that the law was made void by the coming of John [the Baptist], but that what the law and the prophets had taught, had been suited to the very imperfect dispositions of the Jews, who as yet were incapable of relishing perfect virtue.  At the coming of John, the gospel began to be preached, and this called men to a life of perfect sanctity. (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- Our Saviour came not to destroy, but to fulfil the law and the prophets. (Matthew v. 17.) Haydock Bible Commentary    In Christ  Fr.Joseph|`|kdo6qnS9aa	Verse 16: "The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. Verse 17: It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law."    I believe this means that Jesus Christ did not come teaching Christianity to nullify the Jewish Law, but to fulfill the Law. Jesus taught that the Law could be summed up in one word; love.      We are to love God the Father and have no other gods, and to love your neighbor as you love yourself and your family. If you live your life according to these holy standards you have fulfilled all of the law.
AA12003094	Christ has no limitations of time and space. For He is the LORD God Almighty. The reference to Him being the "Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world." Identifies His sacrifice of atonement for us. He is the Lamb without spot or wrinkle, He is the perfect sacrifice for sins, He is pure and perfect, He knew no sin, nor committed any sin, there was no unrighteousness found in Him. He was the Perfect Son of God, He was the only willing sacrifice. Because of the Love of the Father He became the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world.     About time and space - it is limited, for it cannot be everywhere but has a boundary, else it would be its own God, it is not eternal for the same reason it is not God.

1TYZDRUqaa	Melchizedek is an enigmatic figure twice mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament. Melchizedek seems to be the King of Salem, and priest of the Most High, in the time of the biblical patriarch Abram. He brought out bread and wine, blessed Abram, and received tithes from him (Gen. xiv. 18-20). Reference is made to him in Psalm 110:4 where the victorious ruler is declared to be "priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."    He is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 30; in the Roman rite his commemoration is August 26. He is mentioned in the Roman Canon, the First Eucharistic Prayer of the Roman rite|`|AIZvfgscaa	Melchizedek was glassed as the king of righteousness and first king (king of Salem) and high priest of God most high,to whom Abraham honoured and gave tithes; there appears to be no blood line, no parentage.

AA10471892	This particular problem has confused more people than perhaps anything else.    The ten commandments indeed are the core of the old covenant between God and Israel. Christians are not a party to this covenant, and this covenant ended upon the death of the party of the first part, God in the personage of Jesus Christ.    Now here's where all the confusion really gets going.  The new covenant is a "law" of faith (Romans 3:27) and faith expresses itself through love.  Love "fulfills" the law as contrasted to the old covenant where one merely "kept" the law in the letter, despite the condition of the heart.  When one believes the gospel, and believing the gospel is of utmost importance, God gives His Holy Spirit to that person, which is a Spirit of love. It is the new heart of flesh that replaces the heart of stone (stoney heart) we are born with, enabling us through that love to fulfill the law through love, even as both Paul and James declare in their writings.  Love fulfills the law because you would never do anything to harm one you love.  One with the stoney heart could only "keep" a command such as not to murder, but they could still be harboring hatred in that stoney heart.    The Spirit of God, aka the heart of flesh, is also referred to as God's law in this context that is put in the believer.  Deceived legalists conclude it is the old covenant ten commandments that are written on the heart.  If this were so, then there would be no need for the Holy Spirit, and indeed no need for Christ!

We do not have to kill a lamb or goat and use its blood over the door post for remission of sin because the Lamb of God, Jesus Christ who taketh away the sins of the world has atoned for our sin on Calvary.  However, do not believe the Old Testament  does not matter.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Yes, they apply, but as we're incapable of obeying them, we need that New Covenant to set us right with God.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	I never say we should be following the 10 commandments.     The law exists to show people that we are sinners.  Jesus paid for all sins on the cross.  The law exists to drive us to Jesus for free salvation by faith in Him alone.     The law is not of faith.  Once a person is a believer in Jesus, the law can't touch them (Galatians chapter 3), and we're not to go under the law.      Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|bXeHr69Vaa	st augustine quoted .  the n.t. is concealed in the old  the o.t. is revealed in the new   also jesus and his followers orally took their scripture from the o.t.

I'm sure that will get them on the right path.|`|HBp5r76haa	It's funny because when you go through stuff some of you ask for prayer. Then, when you receive the miracle you have been hoping for you are moved for, like, 1 or 2 days and lingering in doubt that maybe you have been wrong all along, for then being sucked up into your own darkness.    I have seen that happening, many times|`|FpMS47sXaa	I only pray for good things for people. I want everyone to be happy.    It's really nothing different than wishing or hoping for good things.

God loves you and there is not a thing you can do about it.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Why pray for you?  Because prayer in the name of Jesus Christ is very powerful, and this life is short compared to all of eternity.  I would not want to see anyone separated from God for all of eternity.  So, in Jesus' name, I ask that you come to know Him as your Lord and savior, before you leave this earth.  Amen.

I, being a long time married transvestite, who adores women to the nines, and emulates them as often as I can, have been completely (except for my head) hairless for years.. But this is my choice since I am a transvestite, and women, obviously, or should not, have hair on legs, chest, arms, under arms etc etc.  And it doesn't take much to "shuck" the hair in favour of nice smooth skin  Rachelle In High Heels  It's all time dedicated to one's self|`|89defcc97f06bb462c28a75ae2e1b729aa	Lmao, nice section to put this in.

824Md65waa	Distance always throws a wrench into these things.  Sending flowers is always nice, but also unoriginal I suppose.  Ideally the best surprise would be to show up at hers on Valentine's day, but most likely that is not possible.  I was in a long distance relationship a few years ago and one of the most memorable Valentine's gifts I have ever received came out of this relationship.  I was at work and my then boyfriend sent me a regular email (like he always did) but attached to it was a power point presentation which he had masked as info regarding an upcoming vacation we were taking together.  Well when I opened the power point presentation I was surprised to find an endearing and hilarious presentation about Valentine's day, how much I meant to him, etc.  It was full of pictures and all sorts of humorous moments from our relationship.  By far the most original, entertaining and thoughtful gift I had received in a long time.

A belief in things not seen or felt.|`|AA11736322	Buddha taught many different types of meditation, each designed to overcome a particular problem or to develop a particular psychological state.     But the two most common and useful types of meditation are Mindfulness of Breathing (anapana sati) and Loving Kindness Meditation (metta bhavana).    Meditation is a lifelong journey. Whether youre a beginner or have been meditating for a number of years, you always have to feed your soul at least once a day.|`|AA11136474	Meditation is about relaxation of body, mind, spirit.  And through many exercises of breathing, visualization and calming techniques you find a peaceful place within to regain your own peace and calm.  '|`|bGUWUgUqaa	Meditation roots from either the Daoist or the Buddhist practice.  Meditation in secular practice helps to promote relaxation and concentration, providing benefit in stress reduction.      There are many Buddhist schools and Daoist schools.  Each school may share common terminology but its meditation may differ from each other; and the enlightenment path is also unique from each other.  For example, in the Falun Gong meditation, no special breathing is required and thinking of emptiness is preferred to maximize energy circulation.      Guided meditation demonstration video, meditation music, and books about Falun Gong are free to download from the URL listed below. If you need any help, contact a local practitioner in your area for free instructions.     Falun Gong is a unique Buddhist School, found in 1992 by Master Li Hongzhi in China. About 100 million people practice in over 80 countries worldwide. Falun Gong is an ancient practice for the body, mind, and spirit based upon the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance. Falun Gong consists of five sets of powerful exercises.    Falun Gong, Tibetans, other Buddhists, and Christians have been persecuted in China. The most offensive human right violation is the organ harvesting from the Falun Gong practitioners in China.  http://cipfg.org/en/news/petition.html        .

I can honestly say, I've been religious since I can remember and it's been a while my mother and her mother have both taught me about my religion, but it doesn't really stick. So really, when your son gets older, he will start forming his own views on religion and the world and eventually decide if your religion is for him, or not. This is just how it works.|`|uxfacsgmaa	No, I think parents should wait until their kids are old enough to really understand the concept.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I think it is unwise to teach anything you can not demonstrate to be true or valid to anyone, but especially to those too young to understand the difference between a demonstrated fact and something taken completely on faith.  Once they reach that age, I think it is okay to explain things you believe without sound reason and why.  But if this method were followed, strictly, most religions would disappear in a couple generations.  And religious people know it, in their hearts.  They must indoctrinate to build an illogical foundation under the child's developing mind, or the religion is unlikely to ever take hold of that person.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|WcxrnINvaa	I teach my children about religion, ie what the different faiths believe (my mother was Christian, my father Muslim), but I don't expect them to follow any religion until they are mature enough to make informed decisions on their own.  My son is now 18 and shows no religious tendencies what so ever and no interest.  I do remember a friend of mine expressing horror that I didn't bring him up in a faith, his idea being that if you don't induct a child into a religion then he or she will never want to have one. I suppose he was right in this case.|`|UWKF7x4faa	I'm an apostate.

You cannot partake of the Lord's table and of the table of demons at the same time.  So your husband is not a Christian, no matter what he says.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Given how many children have been scared by threat of condemnation  I must say no.

There's a whole section about the trauma caused by childhood religion in the God Delusion by Richard Dawkins.|`|bg86ji6naa	NO. Why not let a child live a free thinking life? Religion is a plague.

Just raise your kids happy and free.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	Taught? Yes. Forced into? No.    I'm all for educating kids about everything they're likely to encounter in their lives. If they go without learning the facts about religion, they're likely to get extremely biased, possibly incorrect information from somebody.    Kids should have the freedom to choose their own beliefs, and the knowledge to make that decision an informed one.|`|s40sgQ45aa	You say you are hoping he gets a little more logical in his beliefs as he gets older...      What makes you think your way of thinking is more logical then his?|`|NOTc1b9saa	Wow, what an amazing mix!    No, I think children should not be taught a specific religion, but should be told about a wide range of beliefs so that when they are mature enough they can make their own decisions without having been *programmed* at a young and impressionable age..    Although I have a deep faith in a Loving Creator which Ive gained through many years experience of Healing and contact with Angels, I do not adhere to any specific belief system, rather drawing from different disciplines to form my own eclectic understanding..|`|ccZuEOEfaa	I totally agree with Painted Jezebel, and others who have said similar things.|`|EYPY87woaa	Don't tell kids this is how it should be done.  That's what I think.    Educate them about morals, and teach them about many different religions.  When they're older they can decide for themselves.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	I will continue my religion when i have kids, i will teach then any thing of any religion the want to know.

I consider myself a Christian and I do believe in a higher power that I refer to as God.  I also believe that He came down among us in the form of Christ in order to save us from our sins.  Now, His reasons for that are beyond me--it sounds kinda crazy.  I also allow that He might really be a She.    But I still believe.|`|qlDNesrkaa	first of all mr. christian your questions shouldnt come from rome they should come from God.

The greatest among you will be your servant. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."  "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!

I believe these and all the truths the Holy Catholic Church teaches because Thou, Lord hast revealed them, Who canst neither deceive nor be deceived.     what i believe is in that prayer above. i love god with my whole heart, mind, being, and self.

We have free speech except in churches, a church cannot speak out against the government or the could lose their 301 c 3.  So we are also restricted.  The left want to control the radio talk shows, the already have the TV networks under control.  My question to you would be are you restricted, or will you be restricted in the USA?

Seriously, give that some thought.  What definition can you provide that will exclude, say, Scientology, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster...but will still allow Mormons, Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus.  What about Unitarians?  Want to restrict it just to Christianity?  (A clear violation of the intent, but go ahead and try.)  Are Catholics included?  Westboro Baptists?  Quakers?  Liberal sects that say there's nothing wrong with homosexuals?    Trying to define what a religion or a church may be is de facto setting up a state religion.  It can't be done - and if you try, that definition will slowly narrow until a single church gains control.|`|oVHFz52Laa	Only Jesus can set you free.|`|arI7peKmaa	Isnt that every religion|`|KmULmT7Baa	All religion has blood on it's hands, the crusades, the Salem witch hunt, even prejudices today.

ReH5EoR0aa	Spiritually speaking,  no.|`|AA10578359	It seems a consensus that atheists should burn in Hell because everyone should burn in Hell.    Let me think, that means we are all born sinners, which somewhere in the Bible says so, but babies know no sin, so if they are too young to sin, and too young to "accept Christ" then they by logic should go straight to Hell if they die.    We are born to die, we are born to sin, we are born to go to Hell, so what's the point of being born?  It all sounds so negative if you think about it!    If you don't believe in God, but otherwise live a good, full, optimum life with all the personal morality, don't do any of the bad stuff, and do all the good stuff, because you think it is the right thing to do, you are still a sinner because you don't believe in God, so even if you never sinned, you have sinned.|`|KWwW7N49aa	We all deserve hell.  All have sinned and there is none righteous, no not one.  That is why se accept Jesus as our Savior and Lord.

I believe everyone deserves to live a life filled with peace, love and happiness.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	No, but then my bible says the wages of sin is death, not eternal life in torment, spiritually speaking...|`|aj5IBTuXaa	Nobody deserves to burn in Hell.  However, with the sadist God of the Christians, looks like any kind of punishment is possible.  Consider the 10 plagues of Egypt, the laying waste of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Great Flood, the leveling of Jericho, the many cases where God ordered execution of all men and boys in a tribe plus enslavement of the women and girls, ...    I'm sure that at least soem of the folks subject to those events were innocent based on the law of averages.  Which makes God pretty much a brutal sadist.|`|5dd8eBDYaa	"We all deserve Hell"? Jeezus!    Most of the Xians responding to this have a very bleak outlook on life.    I pity them. If there is such a thing as a soul, they have none.|`|V8qVsKhRaa	We all DESERVE it. But one guy who used to be an atheist was interviewed and he said how he died and he automatically "Like a glove off a hand" was snapped into the spirit world and in hell and he said nobody would wish anyone there, not Adolf Hitelr, anyone and then he cried out to God and asked for another chance, then his spirit sat back into his body and now he's a Christian.|`|AA11008046	Spiritually speaking you have the same opportunity as every one else to serve God during your stay on earth.

You don't have to worry about me sending you there.|`|3sPOfBhDaa	Absolutely not! Just because your an athesists, doesn't make you any less then the next person. God loves all.......|`|z74a7wvlaa	I already answered this a while ago. That they are deep down good and righteous people; they love their neighbors, charitable and obeys the laws of the land.   Jesus said, e.g.  I am the way, truth and life and he who follows me will have everlasting life.  This is not only for the christians; definitely also to those who follows the Jesus way, by being truthful and charitable. As what the bible say, with God, nothing is impossible. So I say again, the atheists even without knowing, they are obeying Jesus by conducting themselves, the Jesus way. So back to the "mercy of God".|`|Ny7PHJiAaa	From a christians point of view...not at all.  For we are all humans ...we just have different beliefs.|`|PJmpTnlKaa	Hmm let me think...    Spiritually speaking, an ex-sinner and ex-convict who has repented and begged god for forgiveness placing his dark history behind him, currently living a quiet life growing cows and chasing scarecrows for a living and goes to church to sing hallelujah every Sunday is going to heaven when he dies. Right?    Whereas, spiritually speaking once again, a great man like Mahatma Gandhi, the man who led India to independence from British domination; who fought for women's right and the ending of the caste system in India; who traded a comfortable life for the bare minimal; who is the epitome of peace and civility; who was the inspiration for great men like Martin Luther King Jr, has been burning in hell for the past 60 years since he died because he was more of a Hindu than a Christian. Right?    Somehow it doesn't make sense to me. So do I think an atheist deserve to go to hell simply because of differences in faith? No I don't think so.
NlzlBV8Haa	"etched in stone" is an expression to this day    It means permanent, & unchanging|`|YupMCYHlaa	The choices for writing things down were fairly limited.  There was papyrus, which was not considered permanent (a few shreds have come down to the present time but very few whole documents, mostly just scraps).  There was parchment made from animal skins.  And there was carving in stone.  Carving in stone was the most permanent.    Plus, carving in stone has a sort of grandeur to it.  Moses goes up a mountain and comes down with writings from God himself, and if it was in pencil or felt pen people would have said "Hey, you wrote that yourself!"  Actually that's what some of them said about the stone tablets.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	If they were written on paper, people would have just said, "You wrote those yourself, didn't you Moses, you crazy SOB," but writing them on stone made people really impressed.

God    2) because the universe- a universe so intricatly designed could not have come into existence through the big bang but it must have been created by an all powerful Supreme Being, God    and 3) our conscience. people call it our conscience because it tells us what is right from what is wrong. this is actually God telling us that we are offending him or pleasing him.    i hope this helped prove there is a God. yes i do firmly believe from my catholic faith that there is a God. not created and He will have no end. the alpha and the omega.

Jesus is the bridge to God. Jesus said in the Bible, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father (God) but by me." Faith in God is a gift from God.

An ethos is a life way. The Jewish people have a bunch of different rules about how they live and what they eat and where and when they worship that generally make them stand out as a group. That alone is enough to bring down a load of idiots to punish you for being different from them. Look at the Muslim way of life as different also. They have caught Holy hell from a lot of people who don't like the way they live. What? they pray toward Mecca, That's crazy to those who have no idea why they are doing it. The Muslims are being reverent to their way of life.  Ignorance is just painful. Ask anyone who didn't know a stove was hot. Catholics where the original evangelical Christians. The Romans had they thrown to the lions. So, the more you know about the Jews the better you will be able to understand why some people don't like them even though they don' know why.

gHo1Vmiuaa	make him a nice dinner and or dessert. here is one of my recipes:    Mini Chocolate Lava Cakes        1 ? cups semisweet chocolate chips   1 stick butter   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract   1/2 cup sugar   3 tablespoons flour   1/4 teaspoon salt   4 eggs   butter cooking spray   1 tablespoon cocoa powder   5 strawberries, cut into slices- optional    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.   Microwave the chocolate and butter in the bowl for 2-3 minutes or until melted. Stir in vanilla.   In a large mixing bowl, combine sugar, flour and salt. Sift these into the chocolate and mix well with electric hand mixer. Add eggs one at time, fully incorporating each egg before adding the next. Beat at high until batter is creamy and lightens in color, approximately 4 minutes. Chill mixture for at least 2 hours.   Coat the top and each cup of the muffin tin with cooking spray. Dust with the cocoa powder and shake out excess. Spoon mixture into pan using a 4-ounce scoop or ladle. Bake for 10 to 11 minutes. Outsides should be cake-like and centers should be gooey. To remove: flip over tin onto a hard surface covered with wax paper. Top with strawberries.  *If serving, melt ? cup of semisweet chocolate chips and then drizzle over muffins; sprinkle with powdered sugar.|`|I9lwHvUgaa	make him a card|`|jUjydHRVaa	make heart shaped cookies    write increasingly seductive phrases on them in icing    leave them in a trail that leads him to the best present of all (upstairs, you know where I mean!!)    wrap that bit as best you can ... a Brazilian??

But that may be because the only energy source I know is the sun, and my own engine (which is a slow machine, aged now and missing the odd beat).

Drifting to me means to look at different perspectives while wandering with purpose.

It may not happen quickly.   If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis.

God did not send his Son to condemn(law) the world: Jn 3:17.  God's Son would not accuse: Jn 5:45, nor condemn: Jn 8:11;  no, not even a woman caught in adult-ery and brought to him.  Rather he cleared the room of accusers, by stoop & rise x 2.    So if your parents remain legalists, tell em to read Romans 2:1 &  Job 15:6 which says thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I;  and if they don't change, 2Timothy 3 says "from such turn away",  and give them both cheeks as you go on unto perfection: Heb 6-13,  notably by leaving the principles(laws) which accuse and condemn.|`|BMgIhRLOaa	God teaches us that all men are imperfect.

Churches already get a tax exemption; they shouldn't be getting funding from the government, especially when many of their "charities" are loaded with strong-arm conversion tactics.

mgo4resgaa	18, but my friend's mom gave be the best advice. put the picture of the tattoo you want in your wallet for 6 months and after 6 months of looking at it, see if you still want it, then you'll know for sure|`|BbK8BVNwaa	I think it depends more on what the tattoo means, rather than the age. If it is a frivolous meaning, I wouldn't condone it. If it really truly meant something, such as a memorial, then I would be more supportive, but however, if the person was still young, I would not really allow it, if it was up to me.    The biggest thing about tattoos and age for me is jobs. Some kids do not think they're going to have a job, and a tattoo they get at 17,18 is going to effect their jobs in the future.     If you are 16+ and planning on getting the tattoo in a place where it is going to be private, even with the most revealing attire.. Why not?    If you are under 18 and planning on getting something that is going to be out in the open and only want it for the sake of having one, I would wait until you have a steady job and know that your employer is not going to have a problem with it. And you know what to do if that job does not work out.       No way I would condone a tattoo on someone really young, sorry. And if you are not old enough to make your own decisions yet, then it is time to wait. A tattoo on your wrist at 17 is going to cost you many jobs by the time you are 27.|`|L2cg59QQaa	I dont really like tatoos so would say never. But thats not answering your question so here goes...

Unless, of course you're a millionare rock star.     1.  Your career/marriage/academic life has stabilized.  2.  You'll know what your lifestyle is, so you'll know what can be "shown" and what can't.    3.  It'll look better when your old and gray because you won't be in the sun as much - you'll be sitting behind a desk all day pushing papers and being a cool-looking yuppie with a good,looking tat, instead of an old person with blotches all over their body.      Example:   Woman at work here hada huge, beautiful Solar eclipse on her back done when she was young - When she became a CPA (30-something) she had to have it removed -- ouch ouch OUCH!    I got mine in my 30's. After grad school. And I can cover it up in the sun or at work.    PS-  I don't regret getting mine in the least - but I prolly would if I got drunk and had it done on a visible place, like my neck or forearm.    Think hard about it- everyone's right so far that responded to you- Once you get it, you're STUCK with it.      PPS-  never, EVER get someone's name tattooed to your body.  Some people get BF/GF/SO names tattooed and they break up and then have to make up a  web of lies and deceit about it when they try to get another relationship.   Even if it's the name of a child/relative of yours...|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	150    Really.    Why would anyone want to do that?|`|TPVvddHWaa	Never have anything permanent.

Their bishop comes to them to get them into Amway or another pyramid scheme, and they trust their bishop absolutely, so they jump right in.  They very credulous, and so easily scammed.    It's funny, though -- my hard-core mormon stepfather, who is a lawyer, used to practice law in Southern California.  He moved to Utah, and after six months moved away...because he was always being hit up to do legal work for the people in his ward, but they'd never pay him.

I only read the tribune sometimes and don't have a tv, so don't stay abreast of all the news.  Though I do know that your question should be reworded....Why are there some....?  There are bad seeds in every religion, but many Mormons are decent folk so don't think this fraud/scams are widespread.|`|JWjlyztBaa	You're reaching if you think you can show Mormon criminality is disproportionate to the rest of society.

We make no claim that they are.  They are free to be criminals or be law abiding.      From what little I read, it looks like he was engaged in criminal activity and should be prosecuted.

It has the fifth highest rate of mortgage fraud.     It has the  most Multi Level Marketing schemes per person in the country.  Those are ponzi schemes.    The LDS church sends all its young men on 2 year missions where they do cold calls and sell their little hearts out. They come home as experienced shills who don't have to believe in a product to sell it. They've learned to make an emotional connection with their victim before they give any real facts. They know how to control the conversation.     When jobs are tight they turn on each other and sell scams. It's very predictable.    Bernie Madoff used the same techniques. It's called Affinity Fraud. You find people in your own little group who will believe you are honest because they are, and you take their money.

61c8oevtaa	Did you just watch it? I did.    I definitely think Emily (I think it's Emily - the nicer one of the two twins) is lesbian. They're trying to make that obvious.    Maybe Naomi as well? Although she seems to be in denial about it. In the episode tonight she acted quite shocked when Emily said she wanted to kiss her.    As for the guys, I'm not sure. Maybe they'll make them all straight this time, since they had Maxxie in the last series and they probably want a lesbian rather than gay relationship this time, for variety... And all three of the guys mentioned that they liked Effy.    =]    Edit: http://www.e4.com/video/rik63Pb8reV0J1aP...    The music in the background's a bit predictable...|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	well it looks like the quiet twin and the blond girl have some history but i cant see any of the 3 main lads being gay|`|K1dqsTKoaa	I've only watched about 10 minutes of it, lol.    I read somewhere that Naomi is a possible lesbian.|`|PeQ40WcWaa	Definitely the quiet one of the two twins.    It would be good to have another gay guy in there too. Or maybe a genuinely bi person.... so that there isn't just the 'token gay' like last season. It's great that shows like Skins do have a gay character, but it would be even better if they had more than one, so that it was more representative of real groups of friends. There is often more than one gay or bi person in a group.    I think Effy should have a lesbian experience.... and eat a bit more ;-)|`|kn6Lrf6Raa	I dont watch   should I start??  is it good?|`|YHFuKUf3aa	I'm sorry, I'm not farmiliar with that show!!!  Good luck though!!!|`|FgaBo4Eraa	Definately Emily, the quiet twin, she obviously made a move on Naomi at some point and now people believe Naomi is a lebian and made a move on her.  Also don't you think that Cook is a horrible horrible person, is it bad that I want his character to be killed off for the finale :S    I loved Maxie, he was a great character, quite cute too :P|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Nice twin Emily (thanks Luca, can never remember her name). She is a lesbian. I so wouldn't complain if she was!!    There is a gay guy in their year. I can't remember his name, but he stood up said "hi, I'm ___ and I'm gay". I don't think any of the three main guys are gay. It would be too soon after Maxie. I loved Maxie, he was so cool.     I'd like if Effy was bi. She is so hot!

This question cannot be answered because it is confused and untrue to begin with.|`|oVHFz52Laa	Of course He allows eternal hell, He gave you your free will and it is YOUR choice|`|VSDaQ9QOaa	There is a problem with your position.  The Scriptures do not state  that anyone will fry like a slab of bacon for all eternity; it simply is not written.   There are those who do not understand when they are reading idioms or figures of speech so commonly used in the Greek.    This is what is written:  When the true Christ returns, he ushers in  a 1000-yr period of teaching and disipline.  Many of those who are being told they are headed for hell, are actually headed for a classroom: they will be TAUGHT, NOT BURNED.  We will all be in spiritual bodies, changed immediately and instantly  upon Christ's return -  changed into a body that is not affected by  fire, so quite frankly it wouldn't matter if you were right smack in the  middle of a bon-fire, at that time.    Those who find themselves changed into a spiritual body, but who  realize they still have a mortal soul (liable to die) will have the millineum  to be taught.  It will be a very serious time.  No person will be judged until AFTER that teaching expires.    After that millinium teaching period is over, comes the Great Judgement.  Those who are found guilty will follow Satan and his  cronies into the "Lake of Fire", which has the ability to destroy both  the spiritual body and the soul; it will only take as long as it will to step into it, and be turned to ashes from within.  Even the memory of you will be gone, as if you never existed at all.  Then, after all go into  the Lake of Fire, even that lake itself is DONE AWAY WITH.  There  will be nothing in the eternity that offends.   After that, the Earth is  refreshed and rejuvinated back into its original state, and we begin  the eternal age.    In a nutshell, either ya make it, or ya don't.  Nobody screams in  horror for all eternity.  In fact, the suggestion that anyone is thrown  into burning flames, is what God calls "just like molech practice which he HATES".  Molech practice was when they would throw babies and small children into a big bonfire as a sacrifice to gods.  God says  telling a person they are going to hell (example with regard to children:  "if you don't be good, God will send you to hell ! ) is just like molech  practice.  He said that the thought never crossed his mind; that this  is something man came up with, NOT GOD.    The reason you read the verse in Luke 6, is because the person you  are hating could just be one of those who repents and ends up doing  a great service to God -  just like Paul who originally dragged Christians to their death, but who ended up writing practically the entire New Testament.  We do not know who will end up in Gods camp and be a person God will use.  We may just end up hating someone on our own team, and therefore be working against ourselves.

SO it is probable, that your child has had an ghostly encounter. The may of even had a discussion on the mental level. Even if it was for a few seconds, and from what i heard, he knows what a ghost is.     Your kid is scared. So, unless if things in the house fall over, or people get injured, the ghost is a freindly one, and will be fine. But if it scares the kid, have the house cleansed, and the spirit will usually go away.|`|uiVEaxjqaa	There's Capser the Friendly Ghost There's scooby dew there's a lot of kids halloween movies that are actually really cute.

So maybe look up on line for people who have the same thing that have actually studied paranormal phenomena that can help. Don't take him to a counselor or any thing that's just probably going to scare him or there automatically going to say somethings wrong with him. So you need to do your research on someone in you area that went to school for things like that to talk to and make sure its not just some crazy person I hope this helps.|`|jyqpeg40aa	it is said that a child, untainted by the society around him, can see things - like ghosts - that an adult could possibly never. people say it is their 'imagination' and it is just to get attention or make a friend in a lonely world. sometimes it is. try talking to him. ask him what is wrong. he will tell you when he is ready if anything. others would say that the ghost is actually their. the child can see it. we cant. we would not even remember if we did. it is a child thing. not much to do if you cant see it or if you dont believe it. try burning an all white candle. see what happens.

7d7f10be6570269f9a60e1c21de7795aaa	There is no harm in using a toy. Sexism affects men as it does women. Women are encouraged to be more sexual and thereby be "liberated", but men on the other hand are expected to stop acting like "dogs." This is due to the Western world's conservative view of sex, which makes sex "dirty." It is okay when women masterbate because they have been sexually repressed for so long that now, new femenism allows the "empowered woman" to be sexually straight-forward. But the view of men and sex has not advanced in the same way because sex, and to some extent, men, are both still viewed as "dirty." I say have your toy, have fun, and as long as you aren't pulling it out showing it to everyone, no one has the right to judge you as anything.|`|AA11102769	There is no harm in anyone, male or female, in having "toys".

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26.

His followers belive that three days later he rose from the dead.  His death and resurection saves the world from sin.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	God made Adam and Eve and although God is omnipotent and omniscient, they developed original sin.  And the first time everyone was bad God flooded the whole earth killing everyone except for one family and then promised He'd never do it again.  But then people were bad again, and they still had original sin, so God sent a piece of Himself down to Earth as a human and then had that part of himself tortured to death.  This persuaded God to forgive, so that if people believed this story, then original sin could be overcome and they could go to Heaven for all eternity, but if they didn't believe it they would be tortured forever and ever.|`|Z4VTYyXgaa	Christ Died on a cross as the ultimate sacrifice  He died for our sins|`|AA11297267	Sure.    Superstitious goat-herding hebrews made up a religion that required them to make blood sacrifices to their mythical god.  People who broke off from the superstitious goat-herding hebrews to make a new religion (christians) decided it was necessary to show that hebrew prophecies had been "fulfilled" with the "ultimate blood sacrifice," so they made up a messiah who supposedly had himself killed as a sacrifice for all.  Then they pretended he came back to life 3 days later.  Their story is full of holes, lacks any historical evidence, and is clearly as made-up a myth as the hebrew myths were.    Short enough?  4 sentences?    Peace.|`|yHfsHp6naa	I can summarize it in one sentence: It never happened.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|Ynsow6qbaa	There was a man named Jesus, we was crucified on a cross.

PKWHLbdfaa	Who is a Christian?      Paul taught many times of the need to keep certain doctrines clear and heresy free.  Christ's messianic ministry, his divine nature, and how faith alone in the finished work of Christ is what God asks of us.  As Christians debate when Christ is coming, or which day to meet on, so we call this open handed issues.    No Christian or even Jew would view Elohim as anything other than one of the many descriptive names given for God.  To view Elohim as God the Father is a Mormon invention.  So no, it's not something that would be considered a Christian doctrine.|`|AA10554783	Hear ye O' Israel, the lord your God is but one God.|`|CmHLKKODaa	One God !    It's not fair to demand adherence to doctrine, Jesus is more than Enough !    We have grown past the need for the Circumcision of the Flesh.  It's about our relationship with Him !

We believe (I believe) in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, and born of the Father before all ages. (God of God) light of light, true God of true God. Begotten not made, consubstantial to the Father, by whom all things were made. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven. And was incarnate of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary and was made man; was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, suffered and was buried; and the third day rose again according to the Scriptures. And ascended into heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father, and shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, of whose Kingdom there shall be no end. And (I believe) in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father (and the Son), who together with the Father and the Son is to be adored and glorified, who spoke by the Prophets. And one holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. We confess (I confess) one baptism for the remission of sins. And we look for (I look for) the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen."|`|tC1hF1y5aa	Yes.  Elohim is God, the Father; Jehovah is Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God the Father, the Savior and Redeemer of the world.  They are not "entities", but the divine, eternal beings from whom we came, and to whom we will return.  We are God's children, but not his begotten children in the flesh.  Believing in Jesus Christ is what makes one a Christian - and it's a bigger responsibility to take His name upon yourself, and then act like you can judge who else is or isn't Christian.
CmHLKKODaa	NO !    Jesus is not A God, He is the God !    EDIT: Chuck, I don't agree with the Idea that Jesus was just another God.  I am familiar with Romans 14, LOL !

Revelation 5:9  ...With your blood you purchased people for God from every tribe, language, people, and nation.|`|WjRqYf6naa	No, you are a Jehovah's Witness.|`|PZKmZ95Yaa	If you know the Nicene Creed, then you are a Christian.

American Heritage College Dictionary: "Professing belief in Jesus as Christ or following the religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus."    We believe Jesus IS the Christ and we DO his teachings. Thanks Nina, for letting us explain this so people now know what a christian is!    Oh, by the way, what did Jesus mean when he said "the Father is greater than I"? Or what did John mean when he said "no man has seen God at any time."?|`|c3zUqmdXaa	Of course not. Jesus is God, with no indefinitive article. See John 1:1; 8:58; 13:19; 20:28; Acts 20:28; Romans 9:5; Colossians 2:9; Heb 1:6; Titus 2:13; Jude 1:4; 2oPeter 1:1; 1oJohn 5:20; Rev 9:13.  Jehovah's witnesses have an adultered translation. I can say it because I read the greek of the new testament. They don't make a translation, they make an interpretaion according to their own theology, obviously. There's no space for "a god" neither in the new testament nor in the old one. Jehovah made clear that all gods are falses, except he himself. So, if Jesus is not one God with the Father, but is even "a god", he is a FALSE god, therefore. Compare with John 17:3: Jesus prays: "Father, let they know only you as the unique true God and Jesus Christ who you have sent". So, if Jesus is "a god", but not "the God" with the Father, there's no logic interpretation except that Jesus is just one more false divinity.|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	No.|`|jCgnnWmuaa	The Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

Call them what you want, but the Bible never says that Jesus is the same as or equal to his Father in any way. It is not for any man or woman to say that someone is or is not a Christian. That is called "judging", which the Bible says not to do. If a person says that they're a Christian, only God Himself can determine the truth and sincerity of such a statement. What good does it do for anyone if you go around pointing fingers at people and telling them they're not Christians if they don't agree with certain doctrines? You sound just like Jehovah's Witnesses when you do that.    Anyone who answers "no" to this question should read Romans chapter 14 very carefully and think about what it's saying.    Edit- That's OK, worker. At least I'm not telling people that they aren't Christian just because they don't interpret the Bible the way I do. Inasmuch as you think I "make Jesus less than he is", I think trinitarians and Jesus- onlyists make him more than he is, but that doesn't entitle either of us to judge who is Christian or not. Romans 14 focuses on a particular aspect of Christian behavior, but the principle established there is that we shouldn't judge or stumble another Christian who thinks differently than we ourselves do. We are all united in purpose, and that is to live our lives in accord with the pattern of behavior that Jesus taught and established, to put faith in his sacrifice for atonement of sin, and to teach these two things to others. See also Mark 9:38-42.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	a god??  Jesus IS God.  if you deny the deity of Christ then you are not a christian.  there is one God manifested in three persons,  Father,Son,and Holy Spirit.  Christ claimed He was Yahweh, He was deity (not just "a god" - but the True God), His followers (Jews who would have been terrified of idolatry) believed Him and referred to Him as such. Christ proved His claims to deity through miracles including the world-altering resurrection. No other hypothesis can explain these facts.  Jesus' two natures, human and divine, are inseparable. Jesus will forever be the God-man, fully God and fully human, two distinct natures in one Person. Jesus' humanity and divinity are not mixed, but are united without loss of separate identity. Jesus sometimes operated with the limitations of humanity (John 4:6; 19:28) and other times in the power of His deity (John 11:43; Matthew 14:18-21). In both, Jesus' actions were from His one Person. Jesus had two natures, but only one person or personality.|`|VxTKNbJRaa	The problem is that certain people do not have a full understanding of Jesus.

As a divine person he is called god but never is he placed equal to his God and Father.    On the other hand, there is not one clear verse in the Bible that teaches that God is made up of three persons equal in power, knowledge or eternity. Even Trinitarian scholars realize that there is not one scripture which teaches the Trinity and that it was a later addition to True Christianity:    A Short History of Christian Doctrine; Bernhard Lohse:  As far as the New Testament is concerned, one does not find in it an actual doctrine of the Trinity.     Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics:  "At first the Christian faith was not Trinitarian...It was not so in the apostolic and sub-apostolic ages, as reflected in the N.T. and other early Christian writings."    Every argument and scriptural evidence presented by Trinitarians demands ignorance from their hearers regarding Scriptural terms, context and Hebrew and Greek grammar and also must force a later meaning into Scripture (anachronism).  By necessity Trinitarian arguments must encourage logical fallacies in order to be effective. As a result they cause Scripture to contradict itself.    For example, the claim that Jn.1:1 does not call Jesus a God must demand an ignorance of Greek grammar and the context. The claim that adding an a in Jn.1:1 is grammatically incorrect is disproved as soon as anyone bothers to check other places where this same grammatical structure appears. For example look at most other translations in the following scriptures: Mk. 6:49; 11:32, Jn. 4:19; 6:70; 8:44 (2x's); 9:17; 10:1,13,32; 12:6. In these occurrences of pre-verbal predicate nouns most translations add the indefinite article a because they know the correct meaning demands it. Those who criticize the NWT's use of the indefinite article ultimately condemn their own translations and their own reasoning.    Next, the immediate context grammatically distinguishes two divine beings, one specified by the definite article as "The God" who is *with* another being who possesses god-ness. Since both are thus members of the class "QEOS" an indefinite sense is conveyed syntactically when god is used as a predicate.  The context also identifies the Word as the "agent" of creation, not the Creator (PANTA DI AUTOU). We therefore have TWO beings, both classified as god, one who is The Almighty God and the Logos who is classed as god in the same sense righteous angels and humans were called God in the Bible.    So the text is not saying that the Word was the same as The God who he was with but, rather, that the Word was godlike, divine, a god in comparison with humans. But NOT God equal with the one he was WITH (1 Cor.15:27,28).    "Christ would not be equated absolutely with God, but only described as a being of divine nature, for the word theos has no article."The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology (Rom. 9:5).    Robert Young in his "Concise Commentary" said: "literally 'and a God (i.e. a Divine being) was the Word." Notice that Young admits that the most "literal" way to translate John 1:1c is to call the Word "a God", not "God".    So the rendering "was a god" is the most accurate and still very literal. The NWT renders John 1:1c exactly as scholars like Robert Young admits it would be rendered if it were to be rendered "literally."    Further, any accusation that Jehovah's Witnesses have translated Jn.1:1 "according to theological bias" is proved to be a deceptive falsehood when we note that dozens of other translations, including Trinitarian translators, have rendered Jn.1:1 in exactly the same way. As usual, such critics must demand their hearers to be ignorant of this fact in order for their criticism to be effective.      Another similarly flawed argument is that since Jesus is called God in the bible that means he must be Almighty God. Again this argument must demand an ignorance from its hearers.    First, even Trinitarian scholars recognized that when Jesus is called God it does not mean he is identified with Almighty God     Karl Rahner, the eminent Roman Catholic theologian, noted that Christ is called "THEOS" to Christ in six texts. Rahner, however, immediately goes on the say that in none of these instances is "THEOS" ever used in such a manner as to identify Jesus with the Supreme God.--Theological Investigations (1961), pp.135ff.    "It is not that Jesus is God. Time and time again the Fourth Gospel speaks of God sending Jesus into the world. Time and time again we see Jesus praying to God....Nowhere does the New Testament identify Jesus with God.""William Barclay; A Spiritual Autobiography," (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans), pp. 49, 50    So while Jesus is called "god" several times in the N.T., over a dozen times the Scriptures explicitly state that he has a God over him at every period of his existence (Mic.5:4, Jn 14:28; 20:17; Rom.15:6; 1Cor 15:28; Rev.3:12). Before he came to earth Jesus was less than Almighty God, while he was on earth he was less than Almighty God and after he is in heaven and as high as he will ever get he is still less than Almighty God!!    Trinitarians must hide the fact that in the Scriptures others were properly called gods without according them the status of Almighty God. In the Bible this title was used of men, angels, Moses, Paul and Satan: (Ex. 4:16; 7:1; 21:6; 22:8-9, 28; Ps. 8:5/Heb. 2:8; Ps. 82:1,6; 97:7; 136:2; 138:1; Jn.10:34; 2Cor.4:4). When Psalm 45:6,7 calls the King God and the NT applies this to Jesus, the context shows that Christ still has a God over him just as the king did (Heb.1:8,9)!!    Next, these argument demand an ignorance of context, because |`|5b6f599299e41970d7035269d59cfe39aa	u r in fact an antiChrist.|`|FK3lCrUaaa	No you are not.|`|ZRQcM64Faa	Oh, there are many that "think" they are a Christian who are not.  Some of these do think that Jesus is GOD while many such as the JW's and Mormons think Jesus is simply an angel.  It does not matter that the book of Hebrews was written to show that Jesus is nor was He ever an angel.      The term "Christian" was first used as a derogatory term for those who followed Christ...Much as the WT uses Christendom today.     As to Jesus being "a god" or GOD, we can take this from Jesus Himself....In John 8:24, Jesus said "Unless you believe that I AM, you will die in your sin"    This is a direct reference to Ex. 3:14 where GOD said He is the I AM (at least until the Watchtower rewrote this verse to confirm THEIR theology)      In short, Jesus said that unless we do believe that He IS GOD...we have no hope of eternal life.  The REAL TRUTH is...who are YOU going to trust...JESUS....or the WATCHTOWER?    EDIT:  Lets have a beer asks     Oh, by the way, what did Jesus mean when he said "the Father is greater than I"? Or what did John mean when he said "no man has seen God at any time."?    When Jesus made that statement, it was as a man.  Remember we are told in Philippians 2    6  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:   7  But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:     Notice that Jesus did not think it was wrong that he was EQUAL to GOD but that He TOOK the form of servant.  In short, Jesus sat aside HIS deity to become a man and as such, then GOD was greater then He.      As to John, you forgot the rest:    No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.     Jesus was the express image of GOD so when we see Jesus...we do see GOD.   Let me put it this way...if YOU have a son...would your son be a dog?   You as a human would have a human offspring. It is surprising that the ONLY SON of GOD...would BE....GOD?       But lets back up to verse 14:  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.     Here we see that JESUS has GOD's glory yet in Isaiah 42:8 that Jehovah will not give His glory to another, yet we see that JESUS has this same glory in John 12:41 when John connects JESUS with Isaiah 6:5    Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.    The New World Translation states:  "I am dwelling; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of armies, himself!  so If JESUS is NOT GOD....YOU and the Watchtower have a problem!    Of course, the King that Isaiah is talking about is the King of Kings...Jesus and note...Jesus is called....Jehovah of armies    This is confirmed in Isaiah 44:6  (NWT)   This is what Jehovah has said, the King of Israel and the Repurchaser of him, Jehovah of armies, I am the first and I am the last, and besides me there is no God.     JESUS is the redeemer.  Jesus is the first and the last but so is Jehovah.  There is NO GOD besides Jehovah...so if Jesus is not God.....then someone is lying.  It is...God...or.....the Watchtower?|`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	No. That person would be a heretic.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

c97884712264a19f23634b93afda8d19aa	I agree with ZERO COOL, Alan, et al.  People need labels.  They always have.  It's how society functions, as you "know" how to categorize people (although most often these categorizations are incorrect--and dangerous).    However, I would like to counter one of your added points.  I don't like to generalize groups of people, though it is sometimes necessary.  I would argue that Atheists are not without belief.  I would argue that *all* people have some form of belief system.  Atheists just don't believe in a god or gods or the supernatural.    For example, those that rely on science must *believe* that science is correct.  That is what science is all about--it, with sufficient evidence, can be disproven, so scientists and researchers must simply hypothesize (which is basically just an educated guess or assumption) as to what is true and real.  Just as many believed centuries ago in a geocentric universe, we now believe in a heliocentric one.  Nothing in science is irrefutable.  Because of this, belief is needed.  Of course, this is only assuming a person believes in science.    Here's another example.  A baby is abandoned (for whatever reason) in the wilderness and ends up being raised by wolves.  This person knows not science or religion or philosophy (at least as we understand them).  However, the now "feral" adult believes, because of what has been observed in the past, that darkness only falls when there is a storm or when the sun has disappeared over the horizon.  What happens when there is an eclipse?  The person must now re-evaluate her or his belief system.  Even those without a god or science have a system of belief.    To generalize again, *everyone* believes.  They just don't necessarily believe in a god or gods.|`|7474ab293c66b550fe4794603dd2cb8eaa	Oh you're mistaken.

Don't give your heart to the world; give it to Him. Because on Earth, things destroy. Your car crashes, you lose your job, your carpeting stains.... but in Heaven is where true treasures lie- the treasure of eternal life. So basically, prepare yourself for Heaven. Give your heart to God because once you get to Heaven, you're there for good, living in constant happiness.

But for that the following should be satisfied....    1. It should be a live one ( Person or animal -including insects)  2. You should have intention to kill  3. You should plan to kill   4. You should activate that plan   5. it should be kill( or die ) because of your plan...    Sin also have weight...  Killing insects are not the same as you kill a man...   You can think like this....   if you kill a man you cannot forget it for your life...  But how many insects that we have kill so far. But can you remember it......

If you want to figure out your religious beliefs, then it's up to you to figure them out however you choose, whether that be through prayer, or researching the biblical references, or asking a member of your clergy for their insight on the subject.|`|AA10819547	Pope John Paul II said that he felt homosexuality was another burden (or cross) placed on an individual for them to carry while following the path of righteousness (I'm paraphrasing).  Pope Benedict XVI is equally adamant (or intransigent).      With such an attitude presented by the Pontiff, I very much doubt you'll be able to reconcile your desire for a relationship with the ability to receive the Blessed Sacraments.|`|c5b8b0891591ad2289fb77a0e415ca12aa	CAN'T BE CATHOLIC   &.......

My feelings are that it is not your Creator who has a problem with any of His creations, but some of His followers who, although having good intentions, are misguided.    I would suggest that you visit the website of a group named Dignity which specifically addresses the needs and concerns of GLBT Catholics.|`|086d30384bd0e4f14fde1a786ddc91faaa	I appreciate your feelings, but I would say that the church is a human institution, and cannot speak for God.  If you have a personal relationship with God, you should make your peace with Him, and not worry about what His flawed human representatives say.  I know this sounds like a simplistic answer, but it's the way I found to reconcile my religious beliefs with my sexuality. I had to think and pray very hard to find out that I believe my faith is in God, not in any man-made institution that 'interprets' His word. It may not work for you, as you have said that you find the Sacraments important.  I hope you can find a way to be happy and at peace with yourself.|`|9169ac1ecba72c375ee6a0a31b5b1cf9aa	The Church, like most reactionary heterosexuals would have a nervous breakdown if it had to admit that living according to the Nature that God gave you is an expression of Gods gift and will.    It would mean that the Authority for how you live your life is God, and that aurhority is communicated a dialogue between God and you. Your sexual and gender identity is God telling you who you are. The Church's role would then be to blend all the faithful together into a community of people defined in all their variety, united in service to God.    That, then, would cut the pope, and millenia of ecclesiastical culture out of its authoritarian, middleman role. They would then be reference guides, pastors, social workers, and historians.....no longer would they be infallible demi-gods and authorities.    Like anyone who has power (whether they physically enforce it, or maintain it by manipulation of propaganda or doctrine) they have identified themselves with it, and cannot let go the power without losing their identity.    Redefining the Church and its role in your life is just too much for them to do. They would have to surrender their identity, and plunge into the waters of the Jordan and rely on God to pluck them out and show them a way to lead a flock that creates boundaries to protect them, without stifling their varied and divine Natures.|`|291d91cdb5d8c81bbded769f510de908aa	every catholic is called to be chaste  a priest is celibate but he will not think about dating some girls  marriage is a union between a man and a woman  love is a matter but marriage is another matter  i don't know how to answer your question  i will answer you by asking you a question:" why there are suffering on the world if there is a loving God?"  i don't know the way of God.it is too high for human to understand  maybe he wants you to carry the heaviest cross  the book of Job may give some food for thought  no one has everything and no one has nothing  you only exchange what you have to get what you want  so what do you really want?  what is the meaning of life? it is to die,but the matter is how will we face the death,will we regret for something,or will we calmly face it  you only have one life,you must live it well  i'll pray for you  i hope you will make a right decision|`|811316351e4db28757d4b5a70c9e6a87aa	Gay women are usually overweight by some or too much. Instead of dieting & working out they go for another woman usually unattractive. Then they don't have to stress watching the figure.God invented sex, only human beings indulge in sex for re-production & pleasure because it was intended that way.All straight people having sex (pure sex no brthcntrl no condms etc.know they are repopulating the human race.) When they use other things bpills condoms etc they are engaging in pleasure sex for reasons like..they have enough kids, dont want any or anymore.What are gays doing??????Maybe companionship has nothing to do with the Eucharist in some peoples eye.but gay sex is direct disrespect to the body of CHRIST which Catholics believe to be all christians.|`|7d9e9cd29214a6cb2b48c8a1a86cfa3baa	Because the pontiff says so.

Si eres una persona que cree que cuando mueres se acaba todo, entonces cualquier dios que permita la muerte es un dios sdico y cruel, pero para el creyente la vida (como la conocemos) no lo es todo, es slo un paso, pensar que Dios es malo por que permite el sufrimiento y la muerte, es como los ni?os que creen que el doctor es malo por que inyecta. Y as como la enfermedad no es culpa del doctor, el sufrimiento no es culpa de Dios, y as como el doctor puede evitar la enfermedad, requiere que nosotros acudamos a l y sigamos sus indicaciones, de el mismo modo Dios nos indica como vivir, si los humanos no seguimos sus indicaciones ?cmo queremos que el acte?, ?preferiras que no hubiera libre albedro y todos furamos buenos a la fuerza?.|`|970e03f0e206d96f1273faf530e66317aa	Ya cllate; seguro que aquellos que murieron no eran ms que herejes disfrazados de fieles y por eso les cay la desgracia encima.

Don't confront him with your suspicions and fears - rather bring it in as a joke.  "Well you and Cindy seem to be getting on fine - if you don't like my cooking, move in with her! LOL!"    Check his reaction and take it from there.  You know him better than any of us on here.  DON'T keep this to yourself though, nagging fears in a relationship can be like cracks in a wall.  The longer you leave them unattended, the more likely cracks will become chasms.|`|4b4ac22b307d13575f5331020f87b798aa	After 12 years you two have been together, which is much longer than most.

Ask her what kind of love she needs that you are not giving her.  But please, don't hang on to something that may no longer be there.  If she can not give you a good answer to your question, I know it hurts - but you will have to move on.  My heart goes out to you!|`|bdea1f609aa7fd3ea1d697ad011f347daa	I know how you feel. the same type of thing happened to me with my ex-boyfriend. I missed him soo much and wanted to try and get him back, but it didnt work, just made me look foolish. Also, she may not be all the worth it if shes just gonna dump you and go for someone she had a "crush" on. Maybe the best thing is to try and move on? You say she loves you but do you think if she loved you that she would break up with you?  Meh, i dont know, but if you feel like you cant move on, try talking with her about it. Tell her your feelings and how much you care about her, and if that doesnt work, then...maybe she wasn't the one for you. Hope that helped lol!|`|567cf8ec364c798af567632ec39f2d6baa	Its not the end of the world, there are more fish in the sea. If she really loved you she would not have left you.

People keep yelling at me for saying this, but gay relationships are usually short term. Sexually adventerous people like gays tend to be get sexually bored with the same person no matter what.     You don't want to hear it, but I only tell the truth, 'cause lies, no matter how many people believe 'em and no matter how pleasent, have a nasty sharp end that usually gets stuck in the softest person around.    BTW, nobody who loves you leaves you except to go to work and come back home. They sure as H$LL don't cheat on you.    Bottom line, you want something long term, find a nice guy who's looking for that, or wait 30 years and find a woman who's lesbian but is looking for someone to be her friend more than a lover.     Sorry, Pumpkin.|`|AA11595993	Try getting involved in something helpful, like a soup kitchen, or an organization that teaches people to read.

66da597893d7b1d350884f2a7ae54441aa	I sincerely wish you the best of luck.  You are going to really, really need it.    I wouldn't expect your family to be very thrilled initially.  Explain that it's not "their fault" that you're gay nor have some malignant evil forces possesed your soul (even if they don't believe it).  While it's always nice to reassure your parents that you know all about safe sex, I wouldn't discuss it at the time merely b/c it's just going to make them imagine horrible things that aren't going to happen.    As for the race part, explain that you love somebody b/c of who they are underneath and what they do, not by race or racial stereotypes.  I think your family will probably sort of overlook the race part for the time being for the more looming concern with you sexuality (I realize that that's probably not much of a comfort).    If you are, or can be, financially independent, be prepared to move out, at least for a few months to weather the storm.  Ideally, you already are financially solvent and the only blow from any negative family reaction will be emotional.    Again, best of luck.  "Be strong. Believe..."|`|5c322307513fab7658d1d02b3c77fa64aa	Since you have a boyfriend, your family will know you are serious about this.   If you are gay and know this is a lifestyle choice you are making, then you have to come out to your family eventually.   You can move and never tell them and yada yada, but you would only see them rarely.  I think if you tell them they may be upset because of personal moral issues, but if they still accept you, then you can still enjoy your family openly.  I think you would have to know how they react to know how to come out.  I think it would be best to maybe come out without having your boyfriend around.  Possibly offer to let your parents meet him?  Its all unique in situations.  My really good friend is gay but fortunately his parents were accepting of it (and kind of knew because he is a little flamboyant).  Best of luck.  I hope you are open about the life you chose to live with your family|`|AA10819547	Don't hide from telling the truth.  You never know their opinions might soften.  Or are you going to live a lie before them, always?     If you just up and leave you'll never know what could 've happened.      If the worst does happen and they disown you - you can still up and leave.    Best wishes|`|77c67adf1a823824ac956c5b28f810efaa	Good luck, you should tell them. I know it will be hard but now that your have a BF they willl find out sooner or later and might as well be sooner.|`|d38ce3b4e311854364c784c2028f7253aa	A lot of people wait until they aren't living with their parents anymore, and aren't dependant on them financially anymore.  If you think you can wait, it's kind of a good plan.  If not, I'd say prepare for the worst (have a backup plan), but remember that sometimes people surprise you.  No matter which view people hold, for or against, many from both camps tend to have different ideas when it's their own family.  Good luck.|`|00f8495fc07bf751be8723e422bac6e2aa	I applaud your decision to live your life openly and honestly. I also know firsthand how hard it can be to tell your family that you're gay. So as you take that next big step, here are some things to keep in mind.    Before you share with your family and friends, you may want to test the waters a bit. Steer the conversation toward topics of tolerance and equality for same-sex couples. Find out how your parents feels about these kinds of issues.    It's probably taken you a while to come to terms with your sexuality, so just remember that it may take others some time to accept that also. Be prepared to be patient. It's perfectly normal for even the most accepting parents to be a little shocked by such a big revelation. Be prepared for some tough questions -- "How do you know this isn't just a phase?" "What makes you think that you're gay?"    To prepare, it may be helpful to visit website like the the American Psychological Association (http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.ht... ) or the Human Rights Campaign (http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=... ) It may also be helpful to direct your parents to supportive groups like Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG, http://www.pflag.org/ )    If you haven't done so already, you may want to tell a close friend that you're gay -- someone who you know will support you.  As your parents come to terms with your sexuality, it will be helpful to have a friendly ally.    Your mom and dad love you unconditionally. So even if it may take some time and some awkward conversations, chances are excellent that your they'll accept you for who you are.|`|80f11911e8f10b4b389bd6771e27bb05aa	I hope all goes well...|`|897ba99e8a194ebc4478074dff749a32aa	Be true to yourself.  Don't worry about what they think.  You should come out.  You'll only be hurting yourself if you don't.  Good luck!|`|b8eee13a97b24567ae7a90b1e06120ceaa	That takes a lot of courage (I can only imagine).    You can only hope that they will reacte in a loving and positive way.  Also, give them time if their initial reaction is negative (here's hoping it isn't!)    Good luck!

Obviously you know that there will be people who aren't used to it who will give you strange looks or maybe even make comments, but who cares? I hate to sound cheesy, but do you honestly value the opinions of anyone who would judge you solely on your clothing? Kudos to you for wearing what makes you feel good, even if it's not "the norm."

If you are a little insecure, then wearing things that make you feel better about yourself will only help.    Even though I'm not "Bi" (gawd, I hate labels.....we are a "pansexual animal after all"......) I always liked High-heel boots as a young man....Demi boots, with the high wooden heel, and the pointed toe.....they were definitely way effeminate for my crowd, and people noticed...LOL But I still felt good wearing them.

I think it's super cute.  I really wouldn't worry as much about pushing a gay image out as I would be worried about making sure I was comfy and happy.

ReH5EoR0aa	He was another Jewish kid who had a gift of knowledge and wanted to share it with others.   I think he was a natural leader type, who loved speaking to crowds, was comfortable with crowds and spoke truths during a time of suppression and control of Roman rule.  The Romans during that time were like the police force - they would just kill you if you went against them.   But Jesus was only speaking words of hope and love, which the Romans just didn't understand.   Like the Hippies vs. military war types.      I don't think he was a criminal at all.  He was a good guy and gathered a lot of people to him who agreed with freedom and truth.  But he scared the Romans and they had to find a way to shut him up without causing riots.  The common people loved the guy and protected him - to a point.  That is why he traveled to all the towns around and was hard to find - the common people helped him.     I don't know about the deity thing - but since we are spiritual beings, all of us - he knew that very early on and was trying to tell everyone that so they wouldn't be so apathetic about life.   I think he was telling people the body is one thing,  and you are a spirit in that body.  He had to prove it so they would all believe him.   He wasn't into spells and such.   That would involve rituals which he didn't do.  He only spoke in parables (stories) so the people would understand.      Jesus' pals were the ones who spread the word after he proved you don't really die when the body dies.  You live on.  That was the hope message.   If it wasn't true it wouldn't have lasted this long.      Anyway, that is what I think.|`|sW6lxVFOaa	He did not even exist. There is no historical reference to him.

He preached the word. I think he taught love mostly, and people were amazed, that God was pure love....Not a God who loves and hates or does evil in the name of Good. So people through love started coming together and then everything made sense like truth would. I think he was not God...since God is one and doesnt work in mystery like the trinity works in mystery.

On Pentecost of 33?C.E., Peter said of Christ: Neither was he forsaken in Hades nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. (Ac 2:25-27, 29-32; Ps 16:10) Whereas the gates of Hades (Mt 16:18) were still holding David within their domain in Peters day (Ac 2:29), they had swung open for Christ Jesus when his Father resurrected him out of Hades. Thereafter, through the power of the resurrection given him (Joh 5:21-30), Jesus is the Holder of the keys of death and of Hades.Re 1:17,?18.    The Hebrew word sheohl occurs 65 times in the Masoretic text. In the King James Version, it is translated 31 times as hell, 31 times as grave, and 3 times as pit. The Catholic Douay Version rendered the word 63 times as hell, once as pit, and once as death. In addition, at Isaiah 7:11 the Hebrew text originally read sheohl, and it was rendered as Hades in the ancient Greek versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and as hell in the Douay Version.      While the Greek teaching of the immortality of the human soul infiltrated Jewish religious thinking in later centuries, the Bible record shows that Sheol refers to mankinds common grave as a place where there is no consciousness. (Ec 9:4-6,?10) Those in Sheol neither praise God nor mention him. (Ps 6:4,?5; Isa 38:17-19) Yet it cannot be said that it simply represents a condition of being separated from God, since the Scriptures render such a teaching untenable by showing that Sheol is in front of him, and that God is in effect there. (Pr 15:11; Ps 139:7,?8; Am 9:1,?2) For this reason Job, longing to be relieved of his suffering, prayed that he might go to Sheol and later be remembered by Jehovah and be called out from Sheol.Job 14:12-15.    Throughout the inspired Scriptures, Sheol is continually associated with death and not life. (1Sa 2:6; 2Sa 22:6; Ps 18:4,?5; 49:7-10, 14,?15; 88:2-6; 89:48; Isa 28:15-18; also compare Ps 116:3, 7-10 with 2Co 4:13,?14.) It is spoken of as the land of darkness (Job 10:21) and a place of silence. (Ps 115:17) Abel apparently was the first one to go to Sheol, and since then countless millions of human dead have joined him in the dust of the ground.
deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Well, yes, all that greed is disgusting.    It's simply not true that love is equivalent to giving someone a V Day gift.    The WRONG thing?!?!?!?!?! A gift is supposed to be something the giver thinks will be appreciated by the givee -- IF it's something that's really for the giver (such as sex-wear, say), then that's one thing, as it's a pseudo-gift. Otherwise, it should inspire gratitude.    Those people encouraging this greed are also disgusting.    As for "giving" him a "good time" -- well, give him what he wants; most guys really like sex. It can be original -- well, maybe not original, as there's nothing that others haven't also done, but it can be special.    Your question reminds me of the most disgusting ad campaign I know: Every kiss begins with Kay (diamonds).    Isn't that the WORST thing EVER? No woman EVER kisses her guy, unless he gives her extremely expensive rocks? Doesn't that make every woman a whore?    I applaud your notion -- spending quality time together, enjoying each other. Isn't that what real, human relationships are all about?|`|AA10392223	Hey, I hate V-day its  a made up stupid holiday.

It reminds me a lot of Dante's Inferno and the idea that Hell is repetition.     Either there is something that is stopping the deceased from crossing over, whether it be an unsettled argument or the absence of a loved one when they had passed away or any number of things troublesome enough to keep them from moving on, or their punishment is to remain on earth unseen and unknown. Which I can see why they would be so spiteful of the living, considering they spend eternity watching them yet never able to interact.     I don't think that it is too far fetched an idea and I actually agree with you on a lot of levels.     Have you ever read the Divine Comedy?|`|p8nDiI3Vaa	Polter has to do with knocking and geist has to do with spirit. It's good that you used the terminology theory because this is just another word for hypothesis until it is proven. Anywho, all it has to do with is knocking of the evil spirits and whatever activity the evil spirits choose to do like throw thinks or shake things. Maybe even one will pass through a body and a person will feel a cold feeling go through them. I highly suggest you read the book of Enoch which it is supposedly a lost canon. I would take it with a grain of salt but it does speak of angels intermingling with humans and how they were devouring regular humans because they had no food to feed them but I don't know how true that is. Also, it was said that the spirits of these half angels and humans became demons but who knows. Read it but take it with a grain of salt. It also talks about dimensions and things like that that he went through and mentions the names of angels and everything. Its something to look at. I know for me its a pleasant sight to see your beautiful face on here.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	Sorry to disappoint you, but while many human spirits can become vengeful and do malicious things, not every spirit that makes your water pipes spring a leak is, or ever was, human to begin with.    If a dog bites you, do you tell someone else that your neighbor bit you, because both your neighbor and the dog have teeth? Non-human entities can interact with human beings on the physical plane in much the same way. Just because your neighbor can bite you doesn't mean that your bite marks are the result of them doing it.    Some poltergeists are vengeful humans, but just as many are things that are sentient only in the broadest sense of the word when compared to human beings. Cujo on rabies is a better rationalist than some of those poltergeists, and a lot friendlier.|`|f0LpNwHdaa	I think they'd know if there dead

AA10368651	I found this movie very scary, because I believe it can happen, whether it really happened to Emily Rose I do not know. But the possibility of possession of your mind and body by Satan and/or his dark angels is truly horrifying. This happened in the time of Christ reign on earth, so why is it not possible now, especially since our world is more evil than ever. I do not believe however that a mind who is truly focused on God and his teachings can be possessed by Satan, because your thoughts would be Godly therefore producing God-like actions. Satan could not posses under these circumstances, he is evil, he can not feed off good thoughts and actions.|`|9ed8e7b49a12b8600f76ffd46df41e59aa	It scared the hell out of me|`|a7059d5b5d731b7636fc0559485e165caa	All false.

El alma es mortal y dejara de existir para siempre si no acepta el regalo de la salvacion en Cristo Jesus.    1 Corintios 15:51-53 (Reina-Valera 1960)    La Biblia ense?a que los muertos "nada saben" y que los muertos en Cristo seran resucitados en cuerpos incorruptibles en su segunda venida. Los que quedemos los que hayamos quedado seremos transfromados y les recibiremos en el aire.      51 He aqu, os digo un misterio: No todos dormiremos; pero todos seremos transformados,         52 en un momento, en un abrir y cerrar de ojos, a la final trompeta; porque se tocar la trompeta, y los muertos sern resucitados incorruptibles, y nosotros seremos transformados.(A)         53 Porque es necesario que esto corruptible se vista de incorrupcin, y esto mortal se vista de inmortalidad.       Eclesiasts 9:4-6 (Reina-Valera 1960)    4 An hay esperanza para todo aquel que est entre los vivos; porque mejor es perro vivo que len muerto.         5 Porque los que viven saben que han de morir; pero los muertos nada saben, ni tienen ms paga; porque su memoria es puesta en olvido.|`|a71a745341a1ff0bcc0475fa38bf6389aa	Es cierto, el hombre es un alma. Te adjunto informacin biblica sobre el tema.  Casi todas las religiones ense?an que, en el caso del hombre, la muerte no es el fin de toda existencia. As es, no solo en los pases llamados cristianos de las Amricas del Norte y del Sur, Europa y Australia, sino tambin en pases no cristianos de Asia y frica. El libro Funeral Customs the World Over dice: La gente de la mayora de las culturas cree que al momento de la muerte algo que sale del cuerpo tiene una vida que contina.  ?Cul es, pues, la creencia general entre los miembros de las iglesias de la cristiandad? El profesor Cullmann (de la facultad de Teologa de la Universidad de Basilea y de la Sorbona de Pars) declara:  Si le preguntramos a un cristiano ordinario hoy (sea o no un protestante o catlico dado a la mucha lectura) qu concepto tiene de lo que ense?a el Nuevo Testamento acerca del destino del hombre despus de la muerte, con pocas excepciones conseguiramos la respuesta: La inmortalidad del alma.  Cuando se les pregunta sobre la naturaleza del alma, los miembros de las iglesias de la cristiandad, tambin, responden en trminos imprecisos, oscuros. No tienen del alma inmortal un concepto ms claro del que tienen los que se adhieren a religiones no cristianas. Esto hace que surja esta pregunta: ?Ense?a la Biblia que el alma sea una parte inmortal del hombre?  ?ES INMORTAL EL ALMA?  En la Biblia la palabra alma aparece en muchas traducciones como versin de la palabra hebrea nphesh y la palabra griega psykh. (Vea, por ejemplo, Ezequiel 18:4 y Mateo 10:28 en Versin Valera, Versin Moderna, Versin Reina-Valera Revisada y Versin de Torres Amat.) Estos mismos trminos del hebreo y el griego tambin han sido traducidos ser, criatura y persona. Prescindiendo de si su Biblia vierte consistentemente como alma las palabras del idioma original (como lo hace la Traduccin del Nuevo Mundo), un examen de los textos en los cuales aparecen las palabras nphesh y psykh le ayudar a ver lo que estos trminos significaban para el pueblo de Dios de la antigedad. As usted mismo puede determinar la verdadera naturaleza del alma para su propia informacin.  Al describir la creacin del primer hombre, Adn, el primer libro de la Biblia dice: Procedi Jehov Dios a formar al hombre del polvo del suelo y a soplar en sus narices el aliento de vida, y el hombre vino a ser alma [nphesh] viviente. (Gnesis 2:7) Podemos notar que la Biblia no dice que el hombre recibi un alma sino que el hombre vino a ser alma viviente.  ?Difiri de este concepto del alma la ense?anza cristiana del primer siglo? No. En lo que comnmente se llama el Nuevo Testamento, la declaracin acerca de la creacin de Adn se cita como realidad: As tambin est escrito: El primer hombre Adn vino a ser alma viviente. (1 Corintios 15:45) En el idioma original de este texto aparece la palabra para alma, psykh. Por consiguiente, en este texto bblico la palabra griega psykh, como la palabra hebrea nphesh, no designa a ningn espritu invisible que resida en el hombre, sino al hombre mismo. Correctamente, pues, ciertos traductores de la Biblia han escogido usar la palabra ser, al verter Gnesis 2:7.Reina-Valera Revisada, Bover-Cantera, Biblia de Jerusaln, Ncar-Colunga; estas versiones y otras usan ser en Gnesis 2:7 pero alma en 1 Corintios 15:45.  Tambin es digno de nota el hecho de que los trminos nphesh y psykh se aplican a animales. Acerca de la creacin de las criaturas del mar y la tierra, la Biblia dice: Pas Dios a decir: Enjambren las aguas un enjambre de almas [seres, Straubinger, Reina-Valera Revisada] vivientes y vuelen criaturas voltiles por encima de la tierra . . . procedi Dios a crear los grandes monstruos marinos y toda alma viviente que se mueve, . . . Produzca la tierra almas vivientes segn sus gneros, animal domstico y animal moviente y bestia salvaje de la tierra segn su gnero.Gnesis 1:20-24.  Ese llamar almas a los animales no se limita al primer libro de la Biblia. Desde el primer libro de las Santas Escrituras hasta el mismo ltimo libro, se contina llamando almas a los animales. Est escrito: Tienes que tomar de los hombres de guerra que salieron a la expedicin un alma [nphesh] de cada quinientas, del gnero humano y del ganado vacuno y de los asnos y del ganado lanar. (Nmeros 31:28) El justo est cuidando del alma [nphesh] de su animal domstico. (Proverbios 12:10) Toda alma [psykh] viviente muri, s, las cosas que haba en el mar.Revelacin 16:3.  La aplicacin de la palabra alma a los animales es muy apropiada. Concuerda con lo que se piensa que es el significado fundamental del trmino hebreo nphesh. Se entiende que esta palabra se deriva de una raz que significa respirar. Por esto, en sentido literal, un alma es un respirador, y los animales son ciertamente respiradores. Son criaturas vivas que respiran.  En cuanto a su aplicacin a las criaturas humanas, las palabras nphesh y psykh se usan repetidamente de manera que signifiquen la entera persona. En la Biblia leemos que el alma humana nace. (Gnesis 46:18) Puede comer o ayunar. (Levtico 7:20; Salmo 35:13) Puede llorar y desmayarse. (Jeremas 13:17; Jons 2:7) El alma puede jurar, desear con vehemencia cosas y ceder al temor. (Levtico 5:4; Deuteronomio 12:20; Hechos 2:43) Una persona pudiera secuestrar a un alma. (Deuteronomio 24:7) El alma puede ser perseguida y puesta en hierros. (Salmos 7:5; 105:18) ?No son estas cosas la clase de cosas que hacen o se hacen a personas de carne? ?No establecen claramente esos pasajes de la Escritura que el alma humana es el hombre entero?

Any belief system so ridiculous and absurd just keeps people stupid.  They no longer have to think for themselves, it's all "explained" to them.  How stupid?  Not less than 20 years ago, people were estimating that religion was well on its way out.  Poor education and people with an agenda have managed to let it creep back in.  We might have had the Internet as far back as 1200 A.D. if it weren't for the dark ages imposed by religion.  Children learn their values more from society and other children than they do from teachers.|`|f6478d19a375670ffa43936398177f9eaa	My religion does not make me scared. It is not necessary to have religion to be a moral person.   But I believe churches can do good for their communities, or they can do bad.  My church donates musical instruments to elementary schools, it supports people in the community when they get sick, a family member dies, or a natural disaster. They fund a camp for kids in foster homes every year. They do blood drives. They do a recovery program for people with alcohol, sexual abuse, etc. They build orphanages in 3rd world countries.     Then some churches don't do anything, some protest with signs that say Murderer, or God hates Fa-gs, and cause more people hurt than doing any good.

Just look at the current political landscape. CHristains running the Govt., and 80% of them BELEIVE we are heading into the final days of Judgement. AND, they beleive this to be a beautiful, glorious thing!

Morals are dictated by society at large, not by any book.    People will do the "right thing" because they have to live in this society too and it's much nicer to live in a world where everything isn't always hurting each other than live in a world of fear, pain and suffering.|`|f90750dbf8594e55fd2c264fafa1fa00aa	Different things work for different people.  I know people of faith who I would define as good people and also people of faith who I would define as not good people.  Laws work on some as a deterrent, but if it worked on all people, we wouldn't need jails.  I think much of it is how children are raised and what their personalities are. Morals come from what is culturally acceptable.  Children learn morals even from their peers.  Religion helps some who cannot accept responsibility for their own actions and need to place accountability on God.  Sometimes, this is how a behavior can be fixed, ie alcoholism.      Religion helps as much as it hurts.  Countless wars and now world politics surrounds religious issues.  Religion in the past has been used as a measure of power over the people, and now its just a matter of political debate.  Good people will be good people regardless of religion and the same for the bad people.  Religion is only required by people who need someone to blame other than themselves.|`|b84034a930dc95309d8b8e54f3e19191aa	Well,by looking at the past.Traditional values will never go out of style.If it's not broke,don't fix it.More and more everyday I see young people have less respect for their parents.Husbands cheating on wives and vise verse.Of course,nobody is safe from that temptation if you don't have a solid marriage.Christianity has in the past taught men and women,boy and girls good values that they can use in their everyday life.Christianity can hold a struggling marriage together if they try not to fix the problem on their own,and adheres to what the bible tells them.  Abortion is more rampant because of decaying views of human life.Homosexuality is considered an alternative lifestyle,but Christianity has literally pulled people out of that life and pointed them in the right direction.People meddle in witchcraft and occultism and it's okay.Common sense tells you it's wrong.  The world now tells you nowadays if it feels good,it's okay as long as you don't hurt anybody.We have tried it with the new philosophy of life,and it's not working.  Remember,Christians are not perfect.We have our stumbling blocks just like the next person,but we have somthing we can go to if we're out of answers.,the Holy Bible.  For a person that reads the bible without an open mind and a hardened heart will not get anything from it,and will consider it gibberish,but that's what the devil wants.Wonder why the world is so screwed up?Blame it man giving up on traditional values and sucumbing to the devil's temptations.  Any grown man or woman worth their salt will admit we have a problem in the United States and abroad,and you can't blame it on Christianity.|`|AA10303590	Both. Here is why...    When people assume that religion is nothing more than a scare tactic to keep people in line, it hurts society. The fear of God is seen as a bad thing only. If you don't behave and do the right thing you will go to hell is used more as a punch-line to a joke. Society has this illusion that the Bible is only a fairy tale. And with that mentality, it hurts society.    I personally have no religion. I have a personal relationship with Jesus. I believe He died for not only my sins but for the sins of all men and women. I preach at our county jail and inform the men that there is both blessings and curses in the Bible. Over the last few months, I have met some of the men outside the jail and they still remember me and thank me for helping them change their thinking habits. They in turn start to have a positive impact on their neighborhoods, families and work place. Thus it is good for society.     As for the children you spoke about. If people would take the time to show compassion and kindness to the children, they will turn out just fine. Children are very easily influenced by what they see and hear. If they see only the bad, they will make poor decisions. If they see only good, they will make wise decisions. If they see both, they will make an informed decision.     It isn't religion that gives us morals, it is the spirit that is living inside of all of us. God gave each of us free will to make decisions on our own. Let me ask a question. Have you ever done something you knew was wrong and later felt bad inside? Or done some deed out of the kindness of your heart and felt a sense of peace and warmth inside? It wasn't religion that gave you that feeling.    I know that society would be a better place if we stopped all the bickering and blaming and started to work together to build stronger communities and tear down wall of racism and hatred. The only way for that to even begin is if we realize that we are all in this together.|`|02a0a0d65ad0c5385b53537669a77aefaa	Hah.. hurts.|`|9922457dc227a00d05e21397b00ba84baa	We should all be agnostic in my opinion.

It is to SAVE THEIR SOULS! The Bible says no one is good enough on their own merit - NOT ONE. We all need a savior.

If there is no one to teach these values then religion does take care of it, but it also teaches my religion is better than yours. so there begins the war!  As far as my knowledge goes i studied in a christian school and i can proudly say that it did more good than harm, but as i grew up i questions my own belief system and that too worked. It did more good to me.|`|bfd540616345c85ba9b687f08939f7bfaa	More people have been killed in the name of religion than any other cause.  I don't think you need to read a certain book , go to a certain building, dress up and follow man-made customs, to be a good person.  You find that within yourself.  To me, every religion has a grain of truth and something to offer to us all.  However religion ends up being just another thing for people to be divided over.   The ten commandments are a fine guideline.  The Golden Rule (do unto others as you would have them do unto you) is the best piece of advice I've ever heard. We could just take those two things and use them to be better people, better countries, a better world.  But no, we have to reinterpret every little thing and use it against other religions that see things differently.  To put it bluntly "My god has a bigger d*ck than your god."  It's ridiculous.   Just do the right thing, be a good person and treat people how you would like to be treated....ALL people...not just the ones that go to the same church you do.|`|d960c41fc906b0c907927826dbf0b859aa	I think all people are born with an innate desire to worship and adore something.  God created us this way.  So, it's not about religion.  It's about a relationship with the Living God who loves you.  And according to God's Word, it is not for fear.  "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love.  We love, because He first loved us." (1 John 4:18-19)  And the thought continues in 1John chapter 5:1-5 "Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him.  By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and observe His commandments.  For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome."  Religion is man-made.  Relationships were created by the Living God, Jesus Christ who died and was raised on the third day that we might live.    I have that relationship and fail daily in my walk with Him.  But with His love for me and His grace, I pick myself up and try again.  I love my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

OTROS PROFESIONISTAS ENCARGADOS DE LA ALIMENTACIN.    DIETISTA:    Es el especialista en la dieta, era considerados auxiliares dietlogos para el desarrollo de sus funciones.    DIETISTA-NUTRICIONISTA:     El profesional capaz de actuar sobre la alimentacin de la persona o grupo de personas sanas o enfermas teniendo en cuenta las necesidades fisiolgicas o patolgicas, preferencias personales, socioeconmicas, culturales y religiosas.    INGENIERO EN ALIMENTOS:    Profesional capaz de desarrollar, dise?ar, operar, controlar los procesos de trasformacin de los alimentos para la obtencin de productos alimenticios tiles para el hombre.

HISTORIA DE LA PROFESIN DEL NUTRIOLOGO.    EUROPA    A partir de 1927 en Amrica y Europa se da inicio el estudio de la Diettica    a escala universitaria. El Departamento de Nutricin y Diettica de la    Universidad de Kings College en Londres fue fundado en 1945 en Queen    Elizabeths College, como el primer Departamento de Nutricin en Europa. Desde esta fecha ha jugado un papel de liderazgo en la formacin de pregrado y posgrado a alumnos ingleses y extranjeros, en nutricin, diettica, investigacin en nutricin y consultora a departamentos gubernamentales, agencias internacionales, a la industria y al sector salud.    La diferencia entre NUTRIOLOGO Y NUTRICIONISTA ES:  El 1o. atiende pacientes con problemas de nutricon, proporciona dietas acordes con sus malos habitos nutricionales y el 2o. Trabaja en centros hospitalarios donde su principal funcion es proporcionar las dietas que los mismos medicos han indicado para cada paciente en particular.    Saludos!!!

Churches are gates or roads but they all lead to the same place and they all have the same basic beliefs.  They are just corrupted by men|`|63401750cd4fccf4645c9c7e89a75e81aa	Yes, its the LDS church that teaches the full truth. Has all the saving ordinances and the preisthood that was here when Christ was here.    Of course the truth matters.... why would you NOT want to know the truth-unless you just dont want to be accountable. But, either way you will be for the knowledge you do have. And if you are refusing to obtain more knowledge you will be accountable for that.    Just embrace truth, live it and reap the joy in this life and in the next.|`|3ccc1a0e8da16a5dd1b49eac226bf9b8aa	Excuse me for being nebulous, but the truth cannot be claimed no matter how long you rant on about it.|`|f6033838dff4b31fe219a05f4b562cb3aa	And your question was???|`|b0cc4dc9fb76a8ba638773bdc9a7518caa	thats why i dont go to church, not because i feel guilty but it pisses me off. i do my praying and believing at home in my own way with my own beliefs.|`|a65598755d0a65a9d5c63451cbb064e2aa	knot  in da least
AA11122635	I'm like hotdoggie, asian and white.  No hapa person is just one so your friend can't just say she's Mexican.  With hapa people, they usually identify with the group they look more like.  But I guess for people that could pass for being either (kinda like me) we identify with whatever group we're with.|`|7070b6b19adb5c9cba4370c8814b0734aa	yes|`|AA11020911	Indonesian. But, it doesn't matter what she labels herslef as because it depends on where she is, if she goes to flordia  or California she will be a different race than if she went to the Ghetto or to New York.|`|21ed487d424135ce66e083d04c9ff1bdaa	If she's asking which of her "identities" is better, then that is a problem in itself.  I am half white, half Asian and others define me by the group we happen to be in.  If I'm in a group of majority whites, I'm considered Asian.  If I'm in a group of majority Asians, I'm considered white.  I've found that if I am in a group of other other ethnicities, it depends (with blacks I'm white, but with latinos I'm Asian).|`|AA11864555	I don't know any , sorry .
AA12277044	I do not think Judas intended for Jesus to be executed but he sure did not know why Jesus was here.  Actually none of the Apostles understood it before the resurrection.      Most of the Jews were tired of Roman rule.  They were looking for someone to reestablish the "Kingdom of Israel" in the same major as King David.  This too is what the Apostles thought Jesus was going to do so I contend that Judas betrayed Jesus to force Him to "make His move" and overthrow the Romans.      When Jesus was sentenced to die, Judas did regret it and he went out and took his own life.   If we read carefully, Jesus was still reaching out to Judas as He was being betrayed...He called Judas...friend.  Another very interesting thing is that when they asked where Jesus was,  Jesus answered them "I AM" and all of those who sought to arrest Him fell backwards onto the ground and they could not get up until Jesus gave them permission to.      Folks...Jesus was in control at ALL times!   Judas could have gone to Jesus as He hung on that cross and said...forgive me...and he would have been forgiven.  He only had to ask...just as we only need to ask today.....Have YOU?  Read the link below!|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	You said, "If we can forgive him why God cant give him an apology? If I can, Why God cant?"   First of all you don't know what went on before Judas hung himself do you? You don't know if God allowed him into heaven or not.   Second, the "gospel of Judas" is proven to be a fake! It's too new, the paper is too new. It was written in the 3rd century. 300 years after Judas was around. It's ridiculous.    Third,  you compare yourself to God? Where were you when he made the earth and stars? Where were you when he and his angels went to battle with Satan? Where were you when he watched his son die for our sins?  Please, don't ever compare yourself to God.|`|AA10249608	How would you have any idea who God forgives. Why believe the   secret of Judas.Jesus is The Messiah,He was for told in the old testament and it came to pass.|`|AA12346961	nobody is born a murderer.    Any guy who conspires to kill another guy is not my idea of a good guy.    Enslavementality, you'd have gotten a guy killed for a few peices of metal? You are no better than a terrorist. You give atheism a bad name.|`|AA11864752	Judas may have been sorry for what he had done.  In fact the bible indicates that he was.  But if he did not repent for his sin, then he did not go to heaven and that is that.  You cannot blame God, you cannot get into God's mind, you have no idea what God's intentions are.  And none of us know if Judas is in heaven or not, everything is just speculation.|`|831048245fb075b5ad4ab55ab7e3fac2aa	Judas was not damned beacsue god would not forgive him...he would not ask he decided to take his own life without repenting for his sin....|`|6e3abcd396d855ae9fe3b104bb7c019faa	???|`|7c93825a3751dbd4d4b05df0566e3079aa	Judas is badazz, he's the only one who truly understood Jebus and he sold his soul to fulfill Jebus's will.|`|679ab9258d5a0c799b64ba02c47f5a23aa	God forgive him you dont that|`|db112c469dc2812e36a266cb44078636aa	Judas kicks a'ss, if I had been in his place I would have sold out jesus for 30 shekels of silver, too. I wouldn't have commited suicide though, I would have bought a beach house. EDIT: Then it's a good thing I'm not atheist, isn't it? Besides, I would have gotten a dirty hippy killed who has had millions of people world-wide killed in his name. That hardly makes me a terrorist,quite the opposite. And it wouldn't be for the money, it would be for the hookers and a beach house|`|b29569bed17f720c4c4c164ca1648f9faa	I haven't read the book, but I'll explain the Bible concept. Judus, someone who was supposed to be a follower of Jesus, betrayed him. He stole from him and mocked him by kissing him on the cheek at the Last Supper. Judus, because of his guilt, hung himself from a tree; he became history's first suicide. God can forgive sin when the person asks forgiveness. He can forgive things that a person doesn't know are sins. Although he is omnicient--all knowing--in spirit, he can't look upon the sin because he is perfect.

53e5bfac3c51bd4f8ccacc4a37c392a7aa	She must have been expecting more than what she got. A lot of people count on their Christmas bonuses to buy presents. not a good thing to do. There isn't much you can say to her.|`|1efbfb814d2392550352cf08072cfffdaa	My first thought was she thought she was going to get more of a bonus and had already spent the money she didn't have.  Now she's more upset with the money spent than the lack of the bonus.  A lot of companies are cutting bonuses this year, she should be happy they didn't hand her a turkey or a ham instead of cash.  Sorry, but there is not much you can do for her but let her sort it out for herself. If she's been there less than a year, I don't know why she's upset, she hasn't had previous bonuses to compare it with.    PS...wish I had a Christmas bonus!    Merry Christmas|`|AA11471613	If this is your boss or manager, stay far far away!  Seriously, she is in a place of position over you, just let her cry and get angry.  Don't be associated with her negativity.  Be thankful and merry and thank whoever did give you it.  Just shy away from her over the holidays.  She may not last too much longer if she is new and is already complaining that badly!!    Good luck!|`|7ead0c0816fe4aebe55c29b572b0dfdbaa	Ask her why she's so upset. She may have a lot of bills she's behind on and was counting on more money. Or in the same token she may just be a greedy bint who thinks her crap doesn't stink and for some odd reason she deserves more than the grunts.|`|5bc502dd1d4ad09ec078fddc0258caf3aa	She was ex[pecting to much, and now cant pay for something she was planning on.|`|56a75992b38cb1b186ebe58723c9f08baa	you never said why she was upset, was it because you got too little or too much? You know the CEO has to get up in the millions before the working people are even considered for anything. One year my CEO got seven million and all the employees got a stick of summer sausage and some cheese and a cracker, Total value about $6.00 the company was Johnson Controls located in Pikeville, Tn|`|AA10119197	Be thankful you are getting any sort of bonus at all. Many jobs dont give such a thing.|`|8f1a3fcf108593e595fa6e5afb008a9eaa	Tell her to suck it up, there are millions with no bonus and even no job.  If she wanted big bonus she should work on wall street.  Some company gave the janitors 600K this year.|`|96efbdee663705d48cccf5d4b3cf2bb5aa	tell her to suck it up and be a man. atleast she got somethin..|`|5575a28ec2741bc8ba6c9f83fa593f82aa	managers are there to reduce costs,and to be upset...  have yoiu seen the movie anger management...  pass him a copy as a xmax present....Magic|`|3d0aa1f04f142c4f4867c476410a7810aa	She needs to snap the hell out of it and be thankful she has a JOB much less gets a bonus!!!  I have been unemployed for over a year and a half and don't cry about it.  No one is "owed" a job and certainly not a bonus.      She sounds extremely unprofessional and immature.  She needs to grow up and learn a thing or two about gratitude.|`|753b34b46fb4d6d9b51cfec4069bdcf7aa	That is what happens when people expect a bonus.  A bonus is just that, something unexpected, an employer is not required to give a bonus.      This will be my second year without one, and the reality is that I have only gotten six in my life!|`|5988d411f1d29f0695bbb2bdb6ccef33aa	"tchem1" has a good answer. Christmas bonuses, gifts are NOT a requirement, that is why it is called a BONUS. The manager is not only being ungrateful, selfish,but a bit greedy and immature.|`|AA11000131	Many people aren't lucky enough to get a bonus at all - especially after less than a year with the company.   Some aren't even lucky enough to have a job at this time of year - my boyfriend's Christmas bonus from his work was a pink slip.  Tell her that things could be worse, but be friendly and understanding about it.  Maybe she had been told she'd been getting more, and now is falling up short.  Compassion, even if her only problem is that she's an ingrate, is the key.    My main suggestion is to give her your sympathy, and then let her work it out on her own.  No need to let her drag you down!    You seem to be grateful of the gift your boss has given you - enjoy it!  Good luck, and happy holidays.|`|c8c9a6b01fa66c6d35c2e98668bda79faa	I didn't even get a bonus!!! Tell her to pull herself together and be thankful for what she has.    Greedy Bastards!!!

Instead newcomers are judged on how they act when they are here in America.  Do they get along with OUR traditions, or are they willing to share some of their own?

First of all, Islam isn't a race, it's a religion. Can you name some facts to back up this statement? You may find some incidents (many trumped up by shakedown type groups like CAIR), but Islamic people in other countries seem a whole lot more likely to be victimized in their native countries by other Islamic people. I'd be willing to bet that most practitioners of Islam in this country are middle class or better, well educated and have never suffered a violent or other type of attack because of their religion. Probably more non-Islamic people in America go out of their way to attempt to be "extra sensitive". You might be shocked at the diversity of this country if you actually went to small town America and saw how many people from all corners of the world co-exist peacefully. I'm sure it would blow all of your preconceptions away. It is in Europe that there are ghettos full of Islamic people from within Africa and Pakistan.     Black African immigrants and African Americans are two different groups in the U.S. To disprove the notion that America is racist,  many Black Africans who come to this country tend to do rather well. They are not automatically accepted into African American society either, since it is a totally different culture. There are African Americans who seem to love all things African and seek an image of solidarity with "Africans", but without any sense or perspective of the overwhelming diversity of Black Africans. It's as silly and non-academic as the notion of solidarity among whites or the notion of an "Aryan" race.|`|2jSW9Asfaa	ummm two words....Barack Obama    if it was ok to be a black muslim, then it wouldn't be such a big controversy over him "secretly' hiding his muslimness|`|T1beLIQqaa	You show your ignorance and racism. Arabs, like the closely related Jews, are Semitic WHITE, NOT Black-yes, you read right. Most Muslims are non Arab(Semitic White), non White(Semitic and Indo European Aryan). Many Afro centrists resent Arabs for being the Ancient Egyptians, not the Black Nubians. The Moors and Berbers are essentially Arabs with 8-15% Black heritage. Many Somalians and Ethiopians are half Black/half Arab Semitic White-many, especially famous models, deny their Arab heritage. Arabs are not Blacks and Blacks are not Arabs-two different ethnicities. Muslim/Islam is a religion, not an ethnicity.Are you sure you are truly Algerian and Muslim and not a troll-you should know better? Black or White Africans can be Muslims. The following seven countries or territories are North Africa and are Arab Semitic White:  Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Western Sahara *     * The disputed territory of Western Sahara is mostly occupied and administered by Morocco; the Polisario Front claims the territory in militating for the establishment an independent republic, and exercises limited control over rump border territories.    Can you not tell  Arab Americans, Jamie Farr(Klinger on Mash), the late Danny Thomas(daughter Marlo), the late Dr. Debakey, Selma Hayek(father Arab American) are a different ethnicity than Black Americans Bill Cosby, Denzel Washington,  Will Smith, and Donna Givens?    EDIT: THUMBS DOWN: BIGOTS(all ethnicities), AGAIN-live with it Arabs are classified as Semitic WHITES not Black and Blacks are NOT Semitic White. I would be proud no matter what the experts classified us as, Blacks to.Every single thing mentioned above is FACT.     *****Also, yes, many Ethiopians and Somalis hide their Arab heritage such as models Iman and Lila Kebede whose fathers are Arab Semitic White.NORTH AFRICANS are ARAB SEMITIC WHITE.*****
iLFYj6Qgaa	If you can't talk about it with your parents, go see a counselor at school. You HAVE to talk about it, otherwise you will feel worse every day.    An important question is: do you love yourself? Do you have qualities? I am sure you do. When you feel depressed, remind yourself that you have those qualities. This will help to feel better.    Remember that you are a good person, and if some people don't love you, it's their loss. The more you will show that YOU feel good about yourself, the more people will accept you for who you are and love you.
spbqfjvbaa	They act like any other man.  Only difference?  They like other men.  There's no characteristics that describe a gay man, since a gay man is first & foremost a man.    If you're looking for stereotypical characteristics that gay men have?  Sweetie, just turn n the TV & watch any shows on network TV.  They pretty much have it covered.|`|N73oZyY8aa	There is no one right way to be gay.|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	I think this is a very silly question. It is impossible to answer this, everyone is different, including gay men.   But all gay men have eyes, normally two, a nose with two little holes in, in general they mostly have two legs, and i think its safe to say the all have arms.  I hope i haven't offended anyone with this stereotypical view of gay men!!    Vik|`|TLOgBy3caa	Like any other guy.  Homosexuals are still human.|`|NWopkX4baa	There's no common characteristics.

sXVkRGJIaa	Um he was the one asking a stranger to suck his ''whistle'' hahaha somehow I think he's uglier.  I also find that the most attractive thing ina guy is his confidence.  My cousin is fat, bald and ugly (not tryin 2 be mean but its the truth) but he acts like he's Gods gift to women but hes really nice and kind too. Well hes going out with a hot girl 10 times better looking than him so that proves my point! lol|`|VsamHLPOaa	Okay let me deal with the important issue first: him trying to stick you up for money. You did the right thing because that guy could've been dangerous. Be more aware of your surroundings at night. As for him coming on to you, you said no and left which was also right. And no one likes to be called ugly, its not insecurity just human nature. But coming from him you shouldn't be too mad, he sounds like a real creep.|`|sc4jNqjTaa	id call the cops as soon as he approached me|`|1c4d63e270980835467d6ecccf8456c3aa	I'm a babe!

LOL|`|8XqfYG2Baa	Even if he did say that, imagine it as a childing response when you don't get the sweet you want they sometimes say "well i didn't want it anyway" and sulk off.  Because he was drunk he was probably just being childish about the whole thing.    I probably wouldn't have hit him to be totally honest unless he got threatening or violent.  But i would have just walked away and told him to get lost before i lost my temper, sort of reaction.|`|Q7EN2Zqbaa	Hard to say, not actually being there but I think there's a good chance I would have hit him.  What was his height and weight roughly?    edit: I think you should have hit him then, just one blow.  Niceness doesn't equate, knocking the guy on his *** would have probably done him some good.|`|pfke6Jieaa	i had that situation once where two gangsters followed me and told me to give them my money. i was on active duty at the time but i still kicked their asses but they never asked to ************ or anything that would be weird. i DID have one gay guy go after me and ask me my name and he turned red....lol. i just told him in a friendly way im straight and i wish him the best of luck and thanks for thinking i look good...lol....idk i didnt wanna be an assohole.     but yes i got ugly especially from girls before but i can care less. ppl just like to be dumb and think everything revolves around them. just ignore ppl im not the best looking either but i can care less who thinks i look good or bad. what matters is my opinion.

NYGDQ3ezaa	I am Christian and go to a Lutheran church. This is the basic Christian message: God is eternal, holy, perfect, love. God loves us so much that He wants to take us all to heaven to be with Him forever after we die. But, we aren't perfect, for sure. So, God sent us His Son, Jesus Christ, to be the model of how to live in the world and to be the sacrifice for our sins. Now, when we accept Jesus into our life as our Lord and Savior forever to be a Christian, we receive God's blessing and forgiveness, guidance and protection plus go to heaven to be with God forever after we die. To accept Jesus into your life, you can say a prayer like this: "Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for my sins. I have done the following sins (state these out) and I pray to discontinue these sins. I pray to receive Jesus Christ into my life as my Lord and Savior forever. In Jesus' name, amen." Praying this prayer will make you a born-again Christian. You could call a few Christian churches near you and see what they are doing.

Popes can get away with it - it's their job.  Yes, Christianity is the one true religion. Sure it's dogmatic and narrow-minded, but the simple truth is that Christianity is the only true religion. Jesus said that He alone was the way to the Father (John 14:6), that He alone revealed the Father (Matt. 11:27; Luke 10:22). Christians do not go around saying Christianity is the only way because they are arrogant, narrow-minded, stupid, and judgmental. They do so because they believe what Jesus said.

bql2RJzWaa	I think they'd prefer to be called 'spirits'. Or the living-impared.   Anyway, Yes! I believe. I've seen 1 spirit, but have heard & sensed many others.   The one that I seen turned out to be my great grandma (whom I have never- to this day- seen a picture of).     I lived with my grandma. My room was in the basement. I was putting on make-up, looking in the mirror in my room. There was a spare bed to the right of me. I heard the bed creak, like someone sat on it. I thought it was the dog. But no one was there. So, to amuse myself, I said, "Oh hi there. How are you..."  The next day, samething happened. I was like, okay, thats weird. That night, I was in bed sleeping. I woke up to a swishing? sound. I turned around & seen this woman standing beside my bed. She had short, white, curly hair. A long, light blue dress & pink slippers. But her feet appeared to be just above the floor. She didn't say anything, but reached out to touch me. I think I was in shock. She didn't actually touch me, but I felt the 'touch'. Then she just turned around & vanished. I remember I could see the clock of the vcr through her head. I wasn't scared by the visit. I felt pretty calm about it.  I have goosebumps recalling all of this.  The next morning, I told my grandma I had seen a ghost (she is VERYskeptical about anything). I described to her what this woman was wearing & what she looked like. My grandma then said- with tears in her eyes- "F*** You!" And slammed the door as she went out.  I was like, "WTF?!" Anyway, I ended up telling my aunty about it & she said that her grandma (my grandma's mom), had buried in that very dress (I had details) & they had put a pair of pink slippers in the casket & she always dragged her feet when she walked with the slippers on...CRAAAZY.   Anyway, my grandpa, who had been in the hospital for a couple of  days was released that day. It was as though she was telling me not to worry. 'Everything will be alright'.  I bet you're gonna get some pretty trippy stories with this question!|`|wdnbwViFaa	yes. i saw my deceased uncle who died that morning at the bottom of my stairs. i feel like i'm around spirits a lot :)|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	Of course not, and the reason is that I can think of a much more plausible and simpler explanation than that somehow beings exist without bodies.     One explanation is hallucinations, which are much more common than people imagine, don't mean anything more than dreams do, and have been studied and explained by altered states, ingestion of various substances, brain defects, and various sorts of short term and chronic mental illnesses from not getting enough sleep to schizophrenia.     Another, even more common explanation is waking dreams, where people confuse a dream state with reality, which explains why most ghost sightings occur at night, just "before" going to sleep or just after waking up. The paralysis people often experience upon waking from a dream, which can feel like someone sitting on one's chest has been experienced throughout human history and has given rise to many superstitions of demons and witches "riding" their victims as they sleep, but of course it's normal and common, and means nothing, just a fluke due to the complex nature of the human mind.|`|YQLTdXhjaa	yes ma'am, i believe in ghosts, i think they're angels.     I see one at least once or twice a month, like for 20 seconds at the most, they don't do anything though, it feels safe. They're usually like white, foggy looking.|`|8nvesSFFaa	No but I caught an orb in a picture.  My family and I went on a haunted tour three years ago and we took a picture outside of one of the haunted places and an orb showed up.  :)|`|BhzCW1rYaa	What we call ghosts reside in the 4th dimension, which is the spirit world and we can't see into that world unless there is a portal or the veil between worlds is thin..  All dimensions have a different vibration, we are surrounded by dimensions we cannot see, but sometimes we do get a glimpse into their world and sometimes they get a glimpse into our world; also remember our dimension is the only dimension where time is measured...    I recently read about a ghost scream which was recorded in England; a team of paranormal researchers were conducting an investigation into a haunting and 3 or 4 women were together in a room when they were taken by surprise by the appearance of a ghost, so they screamed...  The Ghost also must have been taken by surprise as it also screamed, which was recorded on their equipment..  They had the recording analysed and the result was that the scream was not of human origin; so you see we can spook the spooks just like they spook us...    About 1 km up the road from me is an old manse called St Cecilia, this is in Peterborough, Sth Aust...  This old manse hosts 5 ghosts, and the most prominent is the ghost of one of the old Bishops who lived there in the 1870's..  A friend of mine is a psychic medium and he has been on a couple of documentaries which concern haunted places in Australia, and he has been filmed there several times...  I walk past St Cecilia's 4 times a week, mostly at around the 9ish PM mark, but sometimes much later on my fitness walk..  I have personally seen the Bishop 3 times, up on the porch on the far left hand side of the the building...  Every time I walk past the manse all the hairs stick up on the back of my neck and I have that feeling of being watched...  Every-time I have seen the Bishop, he is looking directly at me and it sends a shiver straight up my spine..  He knows my energy and I know his, I just hope he stays where he is, as I honestly believe that there is something a wee bit sinister about him...    I will tell you what happened to me when I first moved into my cottage in the country..  One night I got outta the shower and was drying myself in the lounge room and all of a sudden I was freezing cold; I was as cold as if I were naked and out in a blizzard...  I found my winter sleeping clothes(trackie daks, thermal T-shirt and a wind-cheater) and my thick woolly Pancho and I was still shivering; the temperature in my lounge room was 26C so I should have been quite comfortable in just a pair of shorts; the entity had changed my body temperature...  This happened on 3 separate occasions and I contacted a psychic medium mate of mine and we sent him to the light..  He was an adolescent child who was just having a bit of fun, but that fun could have killed me as it is not healthy to be all rugged up in winter clothing etc when it is in fact really quite warm inside the house....  I still have one entity, and he causes me no dramas at all...  In Light... )O(|`|isnHOG0Waa	I've believe in them. I actually have a picture of one. a orb at the homestead I took.   I saw one that I remember like it was yesterday even i was about 9.     The reeper... same old same old. Black cloak knife thing...    But I might of been dreaming.
U4V6TkZEaa	It depends. If they have a habit of never making eye contact, then I would say, no, he is just his normal shy self.    Besides, if someone is a really good liar, they usually make better eye contact than normal people, because they are trying to read you, to see if you are buying it.    If it were that easy to spot a liar, don't you think that law enforcement would catch & convict more criminals?    ===edit===    What Liars May Do or Say:    Overcompensation (adding details that weren't asked for in an attempt to convince you.).    Change in voice pitch    Anxious to change the subject    A guilty person tends to get defensive while an innocent person tends to go on the offensive     A statement with contractions tends to be truthful. I didn't do it as opposed to I did not do it may tell a lie from the truth  Liars try to avoid being discovered by not making direct statement in regards to what they are being asked about. They imply vague answers instead of denying something directly A guilty person may speak more naturally and calmly (adding those unimportant details) and tend to want to lead the conversation as opposed to following it    A liar may leave out pronouns: we, us, I, (a subconscious attempt to make a matter less personal) and also turn the subject of discussion around to discuss something about the accuser's recent behavior    A guilty person may speak in a passive manner and purposely avoid raising their voice to draw attention to what they are saying    Facial Expressions:    Eye movement (usually in an upward manner as if grasping for an idea) is a good hint that someone is spinning a fabrication    A forced or polite smile in which only the muscles around the mouth are involved could be the hint of a lie. A genuine smile involves the muscles of the mouth, the forehead, eyes, cheeks and the area around the nose.    Staring at an object in the room as opposed to looking you in the eyes could also be the sign of a lie. This gets confusing as some liars try deliberately to look their accuser in the eye while spinning a lie, but look at the rest of there face when confronted like this. Are they straining to look at you? Does their voice have that fake relaxed tone? Are they tilting their head to one side or the other? Are they adding unnecessary details? Eye contact may very well give a liar away when these other factors are taken into consideration.    Facial expressions are usually limited to mouth movements when someone is telling a lie instead of the whole face    Test for a Lie:  If you believe that someone is lying to you about a specific issue here is s simple test: Change the subject deliberately and very suddenly. A liar will follow along with the change willingly and becomes more relaxed. This is because the guilty want the subject changed. The innocent person is confused by the change and will want to go back to what you were talking about in an attempt to show their innocence.|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	It can be but it is by no means given.  You shouldn't trust this single sign as being a reliable tell.  Take it in a framework with other signs and still don't necessarily trust the totality.    I have Asperger's Syndrome and I have always been outside the social norms when it comes to making eye contact.  I look away frequently when I talk with nearly everyone.  But I am one of the most honest and open people you could ever meet.    Sexy Homer:  Law enforcement catches many criminals.  Unfortunately clever defence lawyers have a tendency to get them released.  Remember that it is the courts and not the police who convict.|`|272b4b9f1dbb02370331a991e15d7432aa	Sometimes it could be that someone is lying, or it could be that someone is ashamed of themselves.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	I was one of those.  It wasn't a lack of honesty or intent to deceive.  I was very shy.  I found eye contact, especially with authority figures, very jarring and unpleasant.  I outgrew that in my early 30s, but it took time to build the self confidence to meet someone else's eyes.  When someone avoids mine like you describe, my first inclination is to think they are shy.  They might look at you more readily if you look away.|`|xYTagSIyaa	I have been a show on tv that shows how to detect when someone is lying it is called LIE TO ME.  They said if a person is lying they look you right in the eye to see if you are believing what they are telling you.  Or, they cannot look at you when they are ashamed of what they are saying.|`|Fv07tYnKaa	I used to be pretty shy and would almost never make eye contact when talking to someone.    If it is someone close to you, like your bf, then you 2 should be comfortable enough and close enough that looking each other in the eyes is no problem.  If that is the case, then he may be trying to hide something from you.|`|8nvesSFFaa	It really depends on the person.  If a person fails to maintain eye contact all the time then that person is really shy.  But if a person who always keeps eye contact faisl to he/she possibly may be lying. But good liars always keep REALLY good eye contact.  :)|`|0WstfAmzaa	Sure, it can be an indicator of someone lying, but it can also be a cultural thing, or they could be really shy.   If you know the person well enough you should be able to tell if they usually avoid eye contact or if they are doing it because they feel uncomfortable and/or are lying.    Sometimes people don't think of what impression their body language gives off.|`|OpibjXpTaa	In truth, I've found that there is no single, reliable way to tell if a person is lying.  Everyone has a different way of acting, and so behavioral "tells" such as the one posted in an answer above, are not something that I recommend using.  For instance, if you are told that someone scratching their nose while they answer a question is a sign that they are lying, and then you accuse someone you have never met of lying based on this, the chances are good you will be wrong.  Perhaps they just have an itch, or a twitch in their eye, or maybe they are shy.    The best way to tell if someone is lying is to use the same techniques that polygraph machines (lie detectors) use.  They establish a "baseline" level of behavior, and then measure deviations from that baseline in order to tell if someone is lying.  You can use this method to.  For example, if the person you ask about in your question almost always makes eye contact with you, then his or her looking away may well be a sign that he or she is lying.  If, however, they are normally a nervous person, then looking away might just be a sign of discomfort.    Hopefully this helps. Just remember, the key is to compare how someone normally acts to how they act when you want to know if they are lying.  This, of course means that you have to have enough information about that person to know how they act.  It is very difficult to tell reliably whether or not a stranger is lying.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	In some cultures, making direct eye contact with people you don't know well is considered imposing and somewhat rude, especially if it's to someone in a higher social position than you.    In other situations, people may avoid eye contact if they're shy, self-conscious, easily distracted, etc. It does not mean they are lying. Some people do look away when lying, but since a lot of people don't, you can't make a judgment based on that.    There's no way to be 100% positive as to whether or not someone is telling the truth, and it's hard to make an accurate guess if you don't know the person well enough to know what sort of behavior is the norm for them.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	That can go two ways; liars can look you straight in the eye and lie their heads off or they look away so that is not a defining moment. There are other signs though.
fXtLRYZ8aa	If you are really looking for a UNIQUE gift idea, maybe you can look into taking a Couples Massage Class together!

Ghjaezi5aa	they both mean "you" in the plural form, however, in French, it is used when addressing someone in a formal way, whereas in Spanish you use "Usted" instead, conjugating it like the third singular.|`|OilzDxs2aa	"Vous" is frequently used in French speaking countries to say "You" (plural) and "You" (formal). On the contrary, "vosotros" (being the plural you) in Spanish is almost never used and is often replaced by "ustedes", which also means you in plural.|`|axxQzOCHaa	vous is the more polite form of tu or toi (depending on the content) in french; so it's closer to usted in spanish.    the closest we have in french to vosotros would be "vous autres", but that's used almost exclusively by Quebecois, it would probably be shunned by a Parsian.  even the word "vosotros" is rarely used outside of Spain and possibly Argentina; usually "you plural" in spanish is "ustedes".
FrZkfexqaa	Hi you, good to hear from you, sweetie I think it only seems like that, believe me you, or my ex mother in law would have been gone long ago lol,,,in fact she supposedly been dying for the last 10 yrs now,, and she'll probably out live us all, OOY! and she's one evil let's just go with female dog!!!!  But seriously look at the Charles Manson's and the bad people that have died in jail of old age it just seems that way I know it hurts  and you  know my story, you may have forgot but my sister took her life at 26 and she was so sweet and young and just beautiful probably the best out of all of us girls so ya just never know, maybe God just has a reason for something so much better for them.  But your getting me paranoid I've been living pretty well lately maybe I should not jinx myself and go raise some hell lol,,, yikes ;)  well it was good to hear from you sweetie so keep a little rebel in you ok?  and I'm sorry for your losses I know how painful and devestating loss is, it's totally unbearable, my thoughts and prayers are with you, hows that baby? love Elizabeth xoxo|`|ijh4ycL2aa	Nobody is good.

I consider her a living saint.  She has seen many people go before her.  God has blessed her greatly.    People go when it's their time.  It seems unfair but it's life.      It's not the good that goes first, many good people live a long time.  Good and bad a like go when they go.

Sometimes it does seem that the good people die first.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Yes they do, I kept asking this same thing last year, when our only son was killed in a car crash, people say it was his time, not it was not, it was unfair, parents are not suppose to outlive their children.    It was not fair,but I do believe God had a better place for him and a purpose for taking him so young......    The good people do seem to die first.....and yet all the killers are left to roam the streets.........    It makes no sense...|`|tG9Y6JZxaa	When it comes to a person dying who goes first is not determined on rather on not if he or she was a good or bad person. It all depends on the timing of the Lord to call them home.     If you think about it people die everyday good and BAD.     All I can say it is hard to loose a loved one, but do keep in mind when we get to Heaven we will see them again. If they were Christians.|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	It is very sad...............About 10 years ago, our neighbors (two different families) lost their sons in a car accident.  The interesting part is BOTH were friend, BOTH played the same sports, BOTH went to the same high school with our daughter, BOTH lived in our tract, and.........BOTH were ONLY SIBLINGS.  Yes, both sets of parents lost their only child.  They were left childless.  It is still something that plays on many of our minds, and there are permanent crosses hammered into the cinderblock wall where the accident happened.  Both the driver and passenger up front in the car lived.  Both of these boys were in the back seat.      Now, I believe that the Lord takes, and we will never know the reason why he takes when he does.  That is the mistery we will always have within us.  But, I do believe we will know the reason when it is our time, and we are tested during these times in our Faith in the Lord.  So, I always tell those who have lost to hold onto the ride....it's a very long road, but if you fight to hold strong to Him....he will not only show us the way, but he will give us our answers that we so very much deserve....when it's right, in His time.   So, hang tight, never step away, get closer to Him, and when it's the right time for you to see your loved ones, He will make your path clear.  But, never step away from him for he knows all the answers that you desire to know.  You just have to be patient, and stay on the long and windy road along the way.      Hugs to you.......I'm sure it's not only rough on you, but there are many people in your life, young and old, that need a good role model during times such at this.  They may not know what to do, or how to deal with it, but your good thoughts and strength can be an amazing help them....especially the young ones.  Then this will be just one more pat on the back for you for our dear Lord to see and smile upon.    Good evening..  :o)|`|HRUkmBBxaa	lol  ask my self the same thing     maybe its to help everyone realise that ohh ''Wake up '' ! lol|`|ZJH3735Xaa	I think there's no god.

They die because they have already fulfilled the purpose of their creation.|`|W1DvnFPdaa	my best friend died when i was 10, her being 11. She was beautiful and talented, and had so much ahead of her yet she was taken at such a young age!  i started to think that yes the good die young, but why take them? i would have much prefered to be in her place as i was no where near as talented and special as she was.  but really its fate, a 'good' person could die by being run over, but if they stop to tie their shoelace they could be saved. Imagine someone getting a train, they over sleep by 5 minutes, which causes them to miss the train, then that train crashes and everyone dies, this person is saved.   there isn't a 'plan' for any of us, its just ongoing events which eventually lead to death.  nobody gets through life without dying, and when they die is determined by chance.|`|CmVXzVhNaa	My father died when I was about 14.      5 years after that, my mum remarried.     Her new husband's non-believing brother got lung cancer (smoker).    A little after that, my mum's husband got lung cancer too (non-smoker, but he was a nominal christian).  Through the experience, he became a LOT closer to God.  After about 6 months he died.    His brother (the non-believing smoker) is still alive today.    1.  Who says death is a punishment?  For a Christian it's a reward!  2. I believe the non-believing smoking brother has been given more time/chance to turn to God.    "Where, O death, is your victory?

iT0Z2icCaa	well i think that the various definations of the biblic quotation .... vengence is mine says the lord ....are quite apparent in your scenario . you unjustly lost your job which ive no doubt must have caused you great emotional stress / anger and a deep inner wish to level the pitch of fairness , now at the time had you really lost the plot and carried out some serious act of spite against those people at the time you most likely would have got yourself into deep trouble with the law and might have went to jail , branded a criminal etc , however as you know now by this perfect example that time and nature has its own means and ways of  balancing the scale of fairness , hence the sayings i e its a long road that does not have a bend , those who live in glass houses should never throw stones , he who is without sin cast the first stone ,  judge not and i shall not judge you , live and let live . their go i but for the grace of god, i could go on and on here the list is endless but the lesson is if you have been wronged a superior power will right the wronged , your past grievence is indeed a classic example of ... time is a great healer , so now put all that behind you . your arch eneimmies have learned a bitter lesson and will be concious of their dreadful actions towards you and will have plenty of time ti examine their concience and regret it all , you have survived that awful time and are now well and truly over it their current situation is just begining , so close that chapter of your life , forgive them if you can , it wont be easy but think of obbamas catch phrase , you can and you will. .... it worked for him didnt it , good luck|`|tBtHiPLGaa	I will feel sad since they are going to be homeless.

HYOQfHbWaa	God has given us Free Will. By giving us this gift of free will, He has already granted that whatever we Will should be done. Now it's on us to use our free will in Ideal ways. God is the Love Supreme, and of course He would not want us to choose violence; but He wants us to have the choice so that we choose peace and love not under compulsion but because we understand the worth of it.     God has created the Law of Karma to help us learn the true meaning and consequences of our actions. So what we sow, we shall must reap. What we do unto others shall be done to us.

He actually criticized those who tried to be impressive, thinking "God would hear them for their much speaking".  Merely bring their need before God, and ask for what they need in the name of Jesus Christ.  Also praise God that He is a God that hears and sees.  God bless you for caring for others.
2a93295e665a94d49d03426e34243078aa	>> Do people inherently have immortality?    ????????No.    >> Please explain your answer why or why not?    ????????Because God said so -- in His Word:    1Tim. 6:13-16 (GNB) Before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who firmly professed his faith before Pontius Pilate, I command you (14) to obey your orders and keep them faithfully until the Day when our Lord Jesus Christ will appear. (15) His appearing will be brought about at the right time by God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and the Lord of lords. (16) He alone is immortal; he lives in the light that no one can approach. No one has ever seen him; no one can ever see him. To him be honor and eternal power! Amen.    ????????We neither have an eternal spirit nor an immortal soul.  Only the Godhead is immortal.  This is why we must put on immortality at the last day (1Cor. 15:51-53).  In fact, we don't have a soul at all.  The Bible says that we *are* a living soul (Gen. 2:7; 1Cor. 15:45) -- and so are the creatures of the earth and the fish in the sea (Rev. 16:3).  In modern English, we would say man was made a "living being."    God bless.|`|baa198aacdf80ead59f8f0fea0ada6f8aa	Resurrection or Immortal Soul?The title of the book of one noted theologian, Oscar Cullman, says it all: Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead? It is an either-or issue. You cannot have both.What is the purpose of the resurrection if the saints are already in heaven with Christ and the wicked in hell?Nor is there any evidence that there is some special place called "paradise" where Christians stay in transit until the resurrection when they join Christ in heaven.The uniform testimony of Scripture is that the dead remain in their graves until the time of the resurrection.John 5:28,29 says, "Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear His voice and come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment."Daniel 12:2 says, "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt." First Corinthians 15:52 shows that it is at the resurrection that the saved will gain immortality, and before then the dead are asleep in their graves. "For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable....For this perishable nature must put on the imperishable and this mortal nature must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: 'Death is swallowed up in victory.' O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?"First Thessalonians 4:15 refers to the dead as being "asleep." The text goes on to say that when the Lord returns "the dead in Christ will rise first" (verse 16). Now if the dead go immediately to be with the Lord at death, how can they only rise at the last trump?The Scriptures show that at the resurrection it is the entire person who is raised, not merely his body. "The dead in Christ" are the persons who die in Christ, not just their bodies.Look at Job 14:12 to see unequivocally that it is the person himself, not just a part of him, who rises when Christ returns: "So man [his entire being] lies down and rises not again; till the heavens are no more he will not awake; or be roused out of his sleep."This takes us to the next point: that the Bible consistently refers to death as a sleep.The Sleep of the DeadIf death does not indicate unconsciousness why would the analogy of sleep be meaningful? The Psalmist refers to the "sleep of death" (Psalm 13:3). Psalm 115:17 says, "The dead do not praise the Lord, nor do any that go down into silence." Matthew 27:52 states that "the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised." In Acts 7:60 we read of Stephen who "fell asleep." Second Peter 3:4 speaks of those who ask, "Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued...."Other equally clear texts show unmistakably that the dead are unconscious. Psalm 146:4 says, "When his [man's] breath departs he returns to his earth; on that very day his plans ["thoughts"-KJV] perish." The Psalmist asks, "Dost thou work wonders for the dead? Do the shades rise up to praise thee?....Are thy wonders known in the darkness, or thy saving help in the land of forgetfulness?" (Psalm 88:10,12).The idea that the saints are having a great time praising the Lord and playing on harps finds no support in the Sacred Scriptures! The dead are asleep; they are in silence, in the land of forgetfulness! Psalm 6:5 says pointedly, "For in death there is no remembrance of thee; in Sheol [the grave] who can give thee praise?"Immortality to Be SoughtImmortality is set forth in Scripture as something to be sought and attained in the future. Romans 2:6,7 says that God "will render to every man according to his works; to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, He will give eternal life."Immortality is a gift of God through Christ. It is not possessed inherently by humans. Only the saved will be granted immortality. For proof see 2 Timothy 1:10, which states that Jesus Christ "abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel."What Is a Soul?Let's go to the very first book of the Bible to see God's revelation of what man really is and what constitutes the soul. In Genesis 2:7 we read, significantly, that "God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being [or soul-KJV]." Notice that man was not given a soul; God did not breathe a soul within man. Man became a living soul, a living being.The Hebrew word for soul is nephesh, which is often translated "person," meaning one's entire being, not some immaterial part of him. The Hebrews had a holistic conception of human beings.In Genesis 12:5 we read of Abraham's gathering all the "persons" (nephesh, rendered "souls" in the KJV) they had gotten in Haran. Genesis|`|Rrz62ODcaa	No.  Because only God is immortal and contrary to what some would have you think we are not God.  God gives us eternal life not immortality.

Edit: Excuse me, I thought you said IMMORALITY.|`|dL4x119gaa	immortality in what sense?    in this form, no.    man is triune (three in one) he has an objective physical body, his astral body (the soul) which is the real man.  these two are watched over and illuminated by the third, the sovereign, immortal spirit.    think of it as the christian trinity.  the father is the astral body, the son is the carbon copy of the astral body, the physical body.  and the spirit is your immortal spirit.    Immortality occurs when the real man (the astral body, or soul) succeeds in merging with the immortal spirit, providing enough energy for the soul to jettison the gross, materialistic form we take on in the physical world.     to achieve this, one must live as close to perfection as humanly possible, only a few men have succeeded in this...|`|yHfsHp6naa	Do you mean immortality or immorality?

Revelation 18th chapter    An example:  Daniel 11:31 The disgusting thing that causes desolation,Daniel 9:27 and Jesus spoke of it  (a twofold prophecy)in Matthew 24:15  This prophecy was fulfilled when the disgusting counterfeit of God's Kingdom.

It was to ascend out of the abyss.This it did when the U.N. with 50 member nations including the former Soviet Union was established on October 24,1945.It was now put in place.  It still to this day claims to be the Kingdom of God on earth.

Ahora lo que te falta es interpretarlas. Eso solo tu lo puedes saber. ?Como son esas se?ales de que le gustas?. Es decir, te has dado cuenta de que te admira, de que siempre quiere estar contigo, de que se divierte a tu lado. Entonces solo estamos hablando de una admiracin por tu forma de ser.    Si por el contrario las se?ales van a que siempre quiera estar fisicamente a tu lado; que por cualquier insignificancia te este tocando el hombro, los brazos o las piernas; que te est hablando por telefono a cada rato; que lo hayas descubierto viendote detenidamente incluso hacia partes intimas, como la entrepierna o tu trasero. En fin, ese tipo de cosas, entonces si puedes hablar de que le gustas fisicamente.    Las personas que contestaron antes tienen mucha razon al decirte que lo mejor es que te acerques y se lo preguntes. Si es tu amigo, pues abordalo de la manera ms amable y atenta y dile sin reprocharle, que te has dado cuenta de ciertas actitudes de l hacia ti, y que tienes la duda si hay algo que te quiera decir. Vers que es la mejor forma de descubrir lo que siente por ti. Quizas dentro de todo ests equivocado. Y si eres heterosexual, hazlo saber y dile que lo respetas, pero que tambien pides el mismo respeto para ti.    Si deseas buscar se?ales ocultas, no las vas a encontrar.

Yo estaba casado y l tena su novia El y su pareja haban venido a mi casa un par de veces y hasta habamos ido los 4 juntos al cine o al teatro. Lleg un da que yo me senta muy triste por un grave problema familiar y l me vi llorando. Entonces de manera de consuelo se acerc a m y me abraz con fuerza diciendo mi nombre y yo mirndolo a los ojos, dije el de l. Esto se repiti como 10 veces y para ese momento yo estaba realmente al palo y senta que a l le pasaba lo mismo. Al mirarlo por dcima vez no slodije su nombre sino que le d un beso de lengua que fue eterno y profundo. Juro que no quera que se terminara ese momento. se beso nos marc para siempre. Al da siguiente los dos llegamos una hora antes a la oficina y tuvimos relaciones porprimera vez, estbamos tan calientes y erotizados que fu algo indescriptible. El entonces me dijo que siempre haba deseado que lo besara como lo bes y que estaba seguro que a l le gustaba yo mucho ms que su novia con la cual a pesar de haberla besado jams haba tenido una ereccin. Pasamos un hermoso momento y volvimos a vestirnos... Esa tarde decidimos quedarnos despus de horas, y entonces durante una hora tuvimos relaciones nuevamente y cada vez queramos ms y ms. Como vers ambos parecamos heterosexuales, y sin embargo los hechos demostraron lo contrario. Vivimos un a?o en pareja mientras yo segua casado y hasta nos fuimos de vacaciones 15 das juntos a la playa, donde tenamos relaciones 4 veces por da.

How about that.? The Scripture says though that the prayers of a righteous man availeth much. We do not pray to these people to grant our prayers but, to intercede with Jesus for us and with us.    There is no candle magic in the Catholic Religion--|`|49e67a93e4e4c4cbc2efd7f53464911caa	NO  saints are  not  g0d|`|AA11119479	The saints are often considered intercessors. It's believed that they enjoy a special place in God's kingdom due to their holy lives, and that they can intercede on mankind's behalf. It's not the same thing as "household gods" or demigods, although the concept of patronage (a saint for every occasion) could possibly look that way to some people. I'm not Catholic, but my church also has certain teachings about the communion of saints.|`|afbb65b911f327e89345c13fbf1637c2aa	absolutely--I've known that for years|`|AA11801241	That is a great question, and as a practicing Catholic, I can say personally, for me, there are many coorelations, but it is not the same.  How it works...if you have a problem, like, you are terminally ill.  There is a Patron Saint of Lost Causes, and he has a special prayer called a chaplet, which are prayer beads.  Now, you are not praying to that particulat Saint, you are asking the Saint to interceed on your behalf to God for help.  The belief behind it is that being already in Heaven, the Saint is closer to God and can bring your plight to God's attention faster.  You can also do Candle Magic in the same way, using it to pray to particular Saints so they will interceed on your behalf before God.  However, you would not use these for gains in the everyday world, just like in Wicca, where you are not supposed to use your spells to harm or force your will on anyone.  God would ignore and probably repremand you for wasting his time on a selfish prayer, just like if you believe in Wicca the 3 fold law would kick in.|`|AA10654756	I don't think they did it deliberately, but the end result is the same...|`|e04eb452209dd3002d2d0fa18bdf5cd5aa	Yeah catholics who rely their feith in saints matches pagans...|`|4cfa2f8d5b2034431cf172500c7e4bf2aa	The Saints are not a replacement for pagan "gods".  They are real people in Heaven who are part of the Body of Christ and who help those of us on Earth.  We depend on them for help, in the same way that different organs of a body depend on each other.  To deny the Communion of Saints is to deny the Body of Christ.|`|170fa6a8137f20ddaa69c21728019cb3aa	Nope, I'm Catholic. We don't pray to the saints, we ask the saints to pray to God for us. Just like you may ask your friends here on earth to pray for you, we ask the saints to pray for us. A saint is someone that the Church believes is in Heaven. If they're in Heaven, they're much closer to God than we are.|`|968b3612967b6bd2794e5cad0289e85baa	yes and yes

Those who do not believe have been influenced by the devil.  But are not bothered by the devil. you ask why?

Logically you'd think that Transgendered would be from Earth, between the two. Well I did, but then found out transgendered are from somewhere further away - Mercury.    In Greek mythology Aphrodite (Venus) had a child with Hermes (Mercury). The child Hermaphroditus was born with both sets of genitalia. Since Hermaphroditus didn't have a particular symbol,  Mercury's was borrowed.    Mercury's symbol combines the feminine aspect of Venus - the cross, with a masculine crescent moon.

Children should be raised with some sort of moral framework.  Of course I know what the "right" one looks like but my neighbor disagrees.

One can try raising their child with an exposure to a variety of religious outlooks but that requires a lot of effort on a parent's limited schedule.  And young children think concretely.  They aren't ready for the abstract ideas of any moral system, much less a multiplicity of them.  Trying to explain the pros and cons of any system won't work.  They need experiences.    One can only be responsible for one's own children.

Howwwwevvveeeeeer, if the part of your body that you want surgery on is causing you physical pain, for instance-large breasts causing back and shoulder pain, or emotional pain-such as a birth defect or deformity from an accident, then my heart goes out to you, get it done so you can live a more normal life. Surgery for vanity's sake is risky and unnecessary. The surgery won't fix psychological problems.

Maybe your friend has no idea how left out you feel until you tell them.  If they're a true friend they'll help you through it.

The blue colour is a reference to the sea, and symbolises infinity. Most Hindu gods have particular traditions about how they are represented, and the blue colouring is usually associated with Krishna.    Like all forms of art, Indian sacred art has symbolic meanings and syntax. The "blueness" in pictures of Krishna is intended to represent the infiniteness of God.|`|312c8347ce7086a6ca423f482a2cab1eaa	I'm pretty sure only Krishna is blue.|`|ce394cc3237a1b9e9ba8b97e22c195dfaa	That's the color of sacredness for them, I guess.|`|c797a78f452ce436ff369727fb8e0d04aa	this idol worship|`|AA12346961	Artistic interpretation of divine-- passed down over generations.|`|e9ed40de399b672a656f0bd158661f52aa	Not sure, but I think Krishna was blue.  Also, some blacks in Africa are so black, they're almost blue.  Also, In the Urantia book, it's stated that long, long ago there were other colored races--orange, blue, purple, I think--but, that they have died out.  Possibly, Krishna was of this race???    In addition, you may find the following interesting:    Hindu Prophecies    "Whenever there is decay of righteousness... and there is exaltation of unrighteousness,   then I Myself come forth... for the destruction of evil-doers, for the sake of firmly establishing  righteousness, I am born from age to age." --- KRISHNA- Bhagavad Gita- fourth discourse    Hindus are awaiting the coming of the Kalki Avatar at the end of this present age, Kalki Yuga (Dark or Iron Age). Baha'is believe that the Kalki Yuga age has already ended and, as promised in the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord has again manifested Himself to humanity.... this time with the name Baha'u'llah. Baha'u'llah is the Kalki Avatar.    Baha'u'llah's name means the Glory of Bhagwan or the Splendor of Ishvara. The coming of Baha'u'llah is therefore the start of the Sat or Krta Yuga (Golden Age). It is the time when people will return to righteousness and the world will be at peace.     Baha'is have pointed to the prophecies in the Hindu scriptures and stated that all of these have been fulfilled in this age. There are many passages in the Hindu writings which describe the condition of the world at the end of the Kalki Yuga. Baha'is would say that what is described in the Hindu books is exactly what we are seeing in the world today. Among the most striking of these passages from the Hindu holy books are the following:    "In the Kali Yuga, wealth alone will be the deciding factor of nobility [in place of birth, righteous behavior or merit]. And brute force will be the only standard or deciding what is righteous or just."     "Mutual liking [and not family pedigree, social status, etc.] will be the deciding factor in choosing a partner in marriage; cheating will be the order of the day in business relations; satisfaction of sexual pleasure will be the only consideration of male or female excellence and worthiness; and the wearing of the sacred thread (Yajnopavita) [and not pious behavior or Vedic or Shastric learning] will be the outward index of being a Brahmin.     In the Kali Yuga, only one quarter of each of the four feet of Dharma [panance, truthfulness, compassion and charity] remains. And that too goes on decreasing day by day while the feet of Adharma [unrighteousness] increase greatly. So that in the end Dharma becomes extinct."     "In that [Kali] age, people will be greedy. They will take to wicked behavior. They will be merciless, indulge in hostilities without any cause, unfortunate, extremely covetous for wealth and women. High social status will be attained by Sudras, fisherman and such other classes..."     "When deceit, falsehood, lethargy, sleepiness, violence, despondency. grief, delusion, fear, and poverty prevail, that is the Kali Yuga..."     "...mortal beings will become dull-wittwd, unlucky, voracious, destitute of wealth yet voloptuous, and women, wanton and unchaste.     Countries will be laid waste by robbers and vagabonds; the Vedas will be condemned heretics; kings will exploit their subjects, and twice-borns like Brahmanas will only think of the gratification of their sexual desires and other appetites.     "Celibates [of the Brahma Carya ashrama] will cease to observe their vows of study, purity and celibacy; householders will take to begging [instead of giving alms]; hermits [of the vanaprastha ashrama] will resort to villages [leaving their retreats in the forests]; and Sannyasins will be extremely greedy for money.[in short, the whole system of the Varnashrama Dharma will have broken down.]"     "Petty - minded people will conduct business transactions and merchants will be dishonest."     In the Kali Yuga, men will abandon their parents, brothers, friends, and relatives. They will occupy high seats [and pulpits] and will [pretend to] preach religion.     People will have their minds weighed down with constant anxiety and fear. This will be due to devastating famines and heavy taxation. The land will not grow food-crops, and the people will always be in fear of impending droughts.     There are similar prophecies in many other passages of the Hindu scriptures such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Vishnu Purana. Baha is believe that all of the conditions described in these books have come about today.     Swami Vivekananda, a prominent writer wrote: But greater than the present deep dismal night...no pall of darkness had ever before enveloped this holy land of ours. And compared with the depth of this fall, all previous falls appear like little hoof-marks.     There are also prophecies that we are seeing today of the breakdown of the caste system and the abandonment of religion: "The observance of caste, order and institutes will not prevail in the Kali Yuga; nor will that of the ceremonials and rituals enjoined by the Sama, Rig, and Yajur Vedas. Marriages, in this age, will not conform to the ritual; nor will the rules that connect the guru and his disciple be in force. The laws that regulate the conduct of husband and wife will be disregarded; and oblations to the gods with fire will no longer be offered..."     The doctrines of false teachers will be held to be scripture... In the Kali Yuga, those who practice fasting, austerity and liberality will do so in whatever way they please [and not according to the law]. And men will call this righteousness...     Men of all degrees, filled with conceit, will consider themselves to be equal with Brahmins...

AA12346961	By becoming more matured in your outlook with time. (You already know enough to write all that in a question -- I guess I just repeated what you already know in your heart.)    I suppose if you are young you could still find a man for yourself and make a family. If you are older, maybe you could find a friend who understands you completely. Untill you find someone -- keep the faith. You can always count on God to be there for you. :)    "The willow knows what the storm does not; that the power to inflict harm cannot outlive the power to withstand it." (Check for the author -- I can't remember at this moment.)    Best wishes for a wonderful new year!|`|ecc566b2b7a4878c96826d3e51111de5aa	Jesus teaches us to forgive without ending, to walk the walk of forgiveness throughout our lives.  This is what Jesus meant when he told Peter to forgive his brother that had sinned against him 70 times 7, in other words, he was to forgive him perfectly and without ending.  Start by forgiving yourself---you are the hardest person in the world to forgive.  And then just forgive anybody and everybody.  Keep forgiving and it will become a pleasant habit---you will do it without thinking.  Take the attitude that everybody in the world is forgiven before they offend you and you will not be offended by their behavior.  The problem with not being able to forgive people is a problem in dealing with offenses.  Teach yourself not to be offended by the behavior of others and forgiveness will come easy.  God bless you.  Jesus loves you.|`|AA11790353	"...let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross. For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged." Hebrew 12:1-3    To be a follower of Christ is not a cake walk. It is standing on the TRUTH. It is not just a religion based on a little piece of light that some so called master has found. It is reality and with the stand on reality will come test and trials. You have an enemy that has tried to alter reality and do things different then God has planned. Even our own nature without God is pulled to the natural way of thinking. When you get a new mind it is the Mind of Christ and the only way you will ever deal with it is to renew your mind on a daily basis and keep pressing on towards the mark. If you were really established in your old nature then that means you have established yourself in the mind of satan and he knows the person that was created in you withour God. Now you have surrendered that person and God is trying to build in you the person you are suppose to be in reality. Of course there is going to be a battle and of course you are not going to win all of the time, but remember the WAR has been won. God only allows what is necessary to turn a piece of coal into a diamond or to seperate the wheat from the chaf. You will overcome, and comeforth as a beautiful butterfly. This is just the metamorphous period. We were all crucified with Christ and we all hung on the cross with Christ and died. We were also resurected with Chirst. You will only stay on the side of death until you totally surrender and when you do, whatever satan tries to do to you he will not succeed. God will not allow you to be subject to more then you can handle. There is much more to it and if you need council you can see a Spirit filled pastor or e-mail us at happylife22842@yahoo.com|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	Friend, you said, that your family don't understand you, Neither did my family understand me, God has given me a wonderful wife, & we both see eye to eye on the scriptures, She don't have to tell me how to live nor do I have to tell her how to live, we both have the same spirit of God.

AA10713060	I don't think the world views it so much as a weakness, as much as they just aren't ready to accept it.|`|6fb7392757c2cda50b13cf240bc7aed7aa	Because it is not natural. Nor is it a human function. It is a choice.  It is also a sub culture agenda to get all to accept and acknowledge the homosexual act as normal and natural. And if you happen to believe otherwise you are labled with an "-ist" or "ism". In fact they want to take away a non advocates right to believe in non gay and label them and separate them from society, kinda like what they are saying is unjustly done to them?|`|7d9e9cd29214a6cb2b48c8a1a86cfa3baa	Those who have made the mistake of thinking I am weak have regretted it.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	because we've been taught to hate ourselves by religious people.

Gay isn't who you are, it's who you love.|`|1a004c8ea8d3078ebb7691e0e5206690aa	Gay is not a weakness it is a choice you make.

A few guys assumed that just cuz I'm bi, it was an excuse to try to hook me up (physically and immediately, like "kiss her, come on, you're bi, do it...") with any other female in the area for their own personal amusement...|`|c721fed0b2592e63acd734d10d86a29aaa	Yes|`|d09f9f421df80c0b6d67a419cfaa9464aa	Yes.Never really at the office but my partner and I were referred to by a bright young thing "Oh here come the SPINSTERS. Couldn't get a man to save themselves."  Gwenneth's family were violently opposed to our living together (religious reasons). This went on for 42 years and ever after her death. I suffered a breakdown but have since recovered and learned to forgive them and myself..  Love, Rose P  PS To those with problems, remember we are with you with love and support. RP|`|AA11491405	Yes, and from an odd location.    I was going to college in San francisco.    My brother came down from Lake Tahoe to visit, bringing his wife and my mother along.    He snorted at me, "Well, now that you're gay, that means I have to hate you." (Keep in mind that I am hopelessly heterosexual).    Taking umbrage at his comment, I retorted, "No, I'm bisexual, so you only need hate half of me."    he picked up a tree branch and started to hit me, muttering about f-a-g-s. My mother intervened, but we were all shocked at his behavior|`|AA10819547	yes and none that I care to remember or recount here.|`|a9059da34713cf1fa2b13f04a97e06c1aa	Be trans just cost me a job offer.

Homosexuality is their problem...It certainly isn't mine.
AA11452268	I think you're right about the palm of the hand versus the fist thing. It's more or less equally done by both sexes, just in different ways.    That said, I do think men fart and burp in public more often than women do.|`|1879eba1bddd18b4bdfb0dd3b595d27caa	Um, I don't know any men that cover their mouths when they yawn. I, however, being a girl, do. I think it's much more polite that, if you have to yawn, you should cover your mouth. I'm not sure. Maybe it's just different with the people I know. But I'd say women cover their mouths when they yawn more than men do. Just from MY observations.

AA10713060	You should read Edgar Cayce, he wrote a great deal about Atlantis because he said in a past life he was an Atlantian.  I do believe it is possible that Atlantis existed, but I think it is more likely that it was a morality tale.|`|3942e77c035cfc36aa7643acff17d6bcaa	From one of the apparent descriptions it appears to have been a large Mother ship.

Like with the Arche of Noah, he did not want, that we see his makings, to belive in God, he will that we belive in him, because of HIM.|`|21ccc453064f11130394f2758c2b7a84aa	Sure, why not.

It still does not change the reality about it. Many people who are living now, are the reincarnation of Atlantic people, who did not do their jobs very well, at the time. And still don't, if you take a good look around you. (those self-conceited scientists perhaps!?!) Read some books from Madame (H.P.B.) Blavatsky about this all. For instance:  Isis Unveiled, the Secret Doctrine etc. See the Wikipedia for more information about her works. I wish you good luck in your search for truth!    I forgot to mention Max Heindel.

Scientists in recent years found buried under a thick layer of volcanic ash on Santorini evidence of modern looking multi-story buildings with indoor plumbing systems superior to that of the later Romans, and beautiful artwork and pottery, that was destroyed by the volcanic blast that destroyed most of the island in about 1200 BC.   Nearby ancient Crete (the ancient Minoans) suffered from the effects of a tsunami about the same time, probably caused by the massive eruption on Santorini.    The scientists believe that the evidence of this site matches the story Plato told on many points.|`|43b026b3430d2bb7d20822eb07efdb82aa	i do believe in Atlantis but i believe that the location was not in the Atlantic ocean but the Mediterranean sea. and of course everyone remembers Pompeii and the eruption of Vesuvius. it is possible that some catastrophe event took place and it sunked beneath the sea. and without permission to do excavations we will never know.|`|3fba6da559b6230bebdbfc0628a4f591aa	I thik there was such a place.

You can find enough on line and around the place to change and use for yourself.     Doing a spell yourself can be as simple as lighting a candle and directing your energy and intent.

XxPhbwNfaa	Yo mama jokes are always rude.  You can only tell them successfully to friends who know you well, or enemies.|`|TPVvddHWaa	All jokes can cause offence to some one if the person is insecure.  See the funny side of the story and do not to take it personally.    After all, I am blonde but love 'blonde jokes'. I am not stupid so, I know that they are not about me personally.     How people take a joke can show their personality.  People who feign offence some times do so as a put down. To look superior.    I am English and every year we have a show in the UK attended by the royal family, usually HRH The Queen and others. It is for charity and the money raised from sycophants who pay enormous prices to be seated in the same theatre as royalty raises a lot of money for good causes.    The comedians, usually from the UK and USA often use the royals as part of their act, by making royal jokes. The Queen is always gracious about this and never shows offence.     HRH Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, the Queen's son regularly books the most outrageous comedians for his charity performances knowing that the more they 'knock him' the more the audience enjoys the show.    The trick is to share the humour.     People love to laugh. It is the very best medicine so long as the joke is not malicious. If it is. No one will laugh. I have seen that too.     Since you do not say exactly what was said it is hard to make a comment on the situation but I rather think it is as well to give the person the benefit of the doubt. They wanted to entertain. If they did not and wanted to be offensive then, from your reaction they will have got the message.    Just treat it as a learning curve and do not dwell on it. Next time you see the person, treat them as if nothing has happened. Trust me vendettas are not good.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Most of those jokes are annoying period, so to make one as you suggested, would be very rude.......|`|8tqQXcp4aa	It is very rude to say Yo Momma jokes to someone considering they don't have one.     Since I usually act on my emotions being a girl, lol.  I guess for me the only time saying a Yo Momma joke is when that person is ASKING FOR IT. Like being a complete idiot, annoying, totally extra, hyping about something that is effing stupid. Then that is when I wouldn't think it is rude because they deserve it. Harsh words but now thinking of it, there are people in this world who think their better then everybody because of THIS or THAT. Or those who just seek too much attention. Saying something like that would clearly shut them up. I think I could make a girl cry using it in that context. Hm, maybe I should try..... lmfao jokes.|`|prW1i0vzaa	That is very inconsiderate. In fact, they are inconsiderate even if they do have a mother.    I have never gotten the point of these jokes, and have always found them to be more stupid than funny.

'self how do you feel about the opposite sex?' if you say I like them and date them and want a meaningful relationship with them on both an emotional and physical level. then ask yourself the same thing about the same sex if that is you answer to both then you are bi. Basically date guys and girls. and Don't confuse sexual tensions with feelings I've done that it is not good.|`|MyzX8WcEaa	You could always experiment. But make sure you know that one of your friends really wants to experiment before you pop the question.    Or if you want to be really discreet, watch porn it is useful to use to find out your real sexuality.|`|AA11589320	You ask.  (A)   Is it a good thing to keep to your self?    Don't ask us.  If we offer advice and that causes you trouble why should we be blamed all because you cant decide if you should be honest with the people in your life about your sexuality..  You can make that choice for your self.    (B)  You need to find out for sure?     You don't need clubs.  You know the answer. You just cant see it as your focused on the physical whereas the answer is a mental one. That said I cant follow your confusion.   Its very simple.   First answer these two questions.       (1) Are you  attracted to women?   (2) Are you  attracted to men?      Attracted is a step beyond friends. Things like. You want to hold hands, kiss, maybe sex and maybe from a partnership along the lines of girl / boyfriend. The aim often is to build a life together although a one night stand is also not unusual as its just sex based.       If you are a lady and say yes to:    1 but not 2, your a Lesbian .    2 but not 1, you are Heterosexual.    1 & 2 even just slightly,  you are Bisexual.      For any of theses you don't need to act out the desire.  Its all about your feelings.  Which is why a person who is a virgin can identify them self as any of these with out having sex.

Wt8ZYWmPaa	The plural indefinite articles are, for example:  UN cane --> DEI cani  UNA casa --> DELLE case  UNO specchio --> DEGLI specchi  UN'ape --> DELLE api    These plural indefinite articles can be replaced with:  ALCUNI / ALCUNE    DEI cani --> ALCUNI cani  DELLE case --> ALCUNE case  DELLE api --> ALCUNE api|`|3fHZOobiaa	They actually DON'T exist, but we use some adjectives or prepositions for the plural forms, these adjectives as some one else have said are, for example, "alcuni (m), alcune (f)" instead the prepositions are "dei (m), degli (m), delle (f)"    So never say that "alcuni, alcune" and "dei, degli, delle" are articles    P.S: "alcuni, alcune" and "dei, degli, delle" have almost the same meaning      Bye ^^|`|0XaPAvRLaa	DEI DEGLI DELLE   ALCUNI = Some    Taking Yamster's example    UNO ZAINO....a backback  DEGLI ZAINI.....backbacks or some backbacks
SzNpagjlaa	I'm a Bi and I like this girl too, but we have same classes together, YES. ALL classes. so i'm very lucky ;)  As for you, It's kinda hard to make a move coz the girl that you like is in grade 9 and ure in grade 10.   So about ure question on how u could possibly get to know her?  spend about a week on just smiling at her in the hallways, if she always smiles back, that means there's something.  wait, does she have someone to sit with during lunch?  if she doesn't, then go sit with her.  If she does, you could just go and befriends with her and her friends :)  Then the rest can be interesting ^_^|`|o9cAl8xhaa	I know it's hard, but you are going to have to get up the courage and find an opportunity to start a casual conversation with her.   As you said a smile and a nod would be a good start, then next time actually say 'Hi' and a casual comment- "Nice day isn'nt it?" " I have Ms. Jones for English- did you ever have her?" etc.     Based on  her responses, you will soon see if she has any interest at all in you, and go from there. Maybe you two can study after school, whatever.  But she can't read your mind- nothing ventured, nothing gained...|`|oxeAYFGzaa	Well lets see...you could try sitting at the same table during lunch and talk to her. I know you said you don't have any classes together but do you have any underclassmen friends that might know her? If so you could find out from them if she is in any clubs and if she is you could join the same club. Next you see her in the hall get her attention and ask her name. If you school has a drama club and is getting ready to put on a play ( if you like the play) you could get her attention in the halls and ask her if she is going.    Hope this helps a little good luck.|`|24W08urlaa	first be her friend, then find out if she's gay/bi that way. I would start with a smile first.good idea =)|`|UJHAHoqjaa	maybe u could ask her wat class she has next & walk with her 2 that class.talk well u walk.do that 4 a while then maybe u could ask 2 do something after school.      good luck
AQPmrsVSaa	Man up.    Even if you're a girl. People generally don't say mean things just to be mean, they say them because they believe it's the truth, and they don't believe in sugarcoating things or walking on eggshells for people.    If someone's said something mean about you, you have to either ignore them or change something about yourself. Whichever you choose is fine. Getting upset is an option too, but it's just going to make people more inclined to be mean to you. People who don't take criticism well tend not to be well-respected.|`|t71KwaiYaa	most likely you deserve to be hurt.|`|yIGxQ9Glaa	Aww, I'm sorry. Here's a hug ((hug))

NDX70MtDaa	kay, so as you can tell by my name i like artemis...shes the greek goddess of he moon, the wilderness, the ocean, the animals, and the hunt. She's Apollo's twin, Zues's daughter, and Aphrodite's enemy. Aphrodite and Artemis fight because Artemis was granted chastity by Zues. Meaning she cannot have sex, so Aphrodite wants Artemis to deisre her because she has that power, the power to make anyone love her. APhrodite's the goddess of love. I suppose you could write a myth about how the tsunamis and rain were created. You could say that Artemis and APhrodite were fighting because Artemis did not desire her. You could say that artemis shot an arrow at aphrodite...(artemis has a bow and arrow if the arrow hits you you automatically die)...Aphrodite fell into the ocean with such force that it created a giant wave called a tsunami. Whenevr there is a tsunami, it is becaus eaphrodite is trying to get revenge on artemis and they fight, but if artemis loses she weaps creating rain. hahaha so random...hope that helps! :)

MY ADVISE IS DO YOUR HOMEWORK CAUSE IT IS YOUR DUTY  AND TELL HIM AGAIN THAT YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH IT !!!     I THINK IT SILLY TO FAIL ON SUCH AN ISSUE AS THIS !!!     HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SALVATION !!!     THIS WOULD COME UNDER THE SCRIPTURE OF ,,SWALLOWING A CAMEL AND STRAINING ON A NAT !!!|`|XJ9oSR2daa	That is not persecution... seriously.    Talk to the christians in India, Congo etc and you will see persecution.    Now back to your question, go talk to the dean of the school about the issue.|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	Awwww...    Poor you.|`|qbelhflAaa	Do it and get over it. Or fail.    Either way, stop being a baby.|`|IQIMyE5Naa	May as well give up antibiotics, too...|`|89MKzLl3aa	Oh boy, you are a troll or an idiot- I'm sorry to say, but you have made a fool of yourself in class. If you feel persecuted it's because of your own doing. I'm a Christian, but there is absolutely no proof that the earth is only 6,000 years old-that's absurd.|`|AA12360579	That's not persecution.  You wanna hear about REAL religious persecution?  It's illegal in China to be Christian.  Some people in Africa get killed for certain beliefs.  People in the Middle East are constantly getting killed for their beliefs.    What have you got to do?  Either flunk a test, or do the work.  Whoop-di-doo.|`|r8rykCkGaa	I had some problems with atheistic teachers too when going to a community college in this area.  Looking back, I wondered what I could have done in some cases.  I was trying to get a certain degree and getting out of the class would not enable me to do that.  However, I do feel it would be good to talk to the dean about the situation.  Even if the dean doesn't see your side of it completely, you would have made your point.  But, also, if you can change classes do that---but it wouldn't change the teacher or the school that way.  To bring change, if possible, you need to talk to the dean or president of the college I'd say.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	This is not persecution, and it's an insult to those of us who have experienced *real* persecution.    At any rate, the assumption that the world is millions of years old has nothing specific to do with evolution, and your bible does not specifically say that the earth is 6000 years old, that's someone's personal interpretation of it.|`|F0sQ18MKaa	I'm an atheist, but if you feel that strongly about it, stand your ground and refuse to take the test, and fail it.|`|DSNlt2h0aa	I don't remember the bible saying 6,000 years... It's just kind of an assumption Christians make ;)    Anyways, definitely have a talk with your teacher about how you feel about the assignment. If that doesn't clear things up, you may have to take it to people in higher positions.|`|G15dXNlKaa	The assignment was to do a calculation with the given variables. Of course no one of any belief system, religious or atheist, can truly prove what was happening millions of years ago. You were not required to change your beliefs just process the given information. If your concept of God is so accurate then why do you fear questioning it? If you are correct in all your beliefs they should all stand up to questioning and of course if it is sin then we know that Jesus forgave all sins long ago. If you fear God so much that you can't even do a math problem maybe you have a problem with your level of faith in his goodness.    Think about this: Jesus told parables all the time. If the bible didn't specifically state they were parables would you consider the possibility they were parables? Why then do you assume there are no other parables contained in the bible? Maybe Adam and Eve is a parable. Jesus established the bible contained parables, if you assume that everyone who thinks there other parables in the bible is wrong are you assuming the bible is inconsistent?
pYimIJAWaa	I think that as someone who is part of womankind (and HUmankind), I'll sit back and let you guys (male persons) duke it out over this one.|`|debc261b54bfd7d11fd84dccf078f37aaa	People are just people it is what you do that makes you bad or good. We all have that choice.|`|BtFbHjHZaa	I think Man is inherently good by nature.    we are very bad FOR nature though.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	We are good when it suits us, and bad when it suits us.|`|WLvGFqAwaa	I believe that humankind has free will and the ability to judge (with a sound mind) what is good and what is evil and to act accordingly.  I also believe that the nature of humankind is to always be improving and striving to do better every day.|`|LWzrCu5caa	This was debated in great detail in the Middle Ages.  I believe St. Thomas of Aquinas was one of the main debaters.       The answer they came up with is that man is basically neither.   If he was basically Good,  what do we need God for?  If he was basically bad,  what do we need the Devil for?    And thus you get little cartoon figures of an angel and a devil sitting on your shoulders each telling you do be good or bad.|`|us9JQrTJaa	I think man kind cannot be stereotyped into one group; people make decisions that are both bad and good. No one is just one, and everyone is tempted. It is not the good and the bad that should separate us, but how we judge what is and what isn't, what should and what shouldn't, what's right and what's wrong. It is our decisions that change us and make us unique, and no one person can be all bad or good.|`|hjxsX4liaa	Neither, we are selfish by nature.    Which make's every single good thing in the world all the more wonderfull. Sometimes, people hold door's open for strangers if the stranger has their arm's full! Wonderfull!  : )    Peace  : )|`|164DAI8Taa	Well for one, "good" and "bad" are relative terms. Everyone has their own definition of them. I'm sure some murderers think that their crimes were perfectly justified and they had the right to do it (even though it was wrong).    I think that people are born neutral; you're not a "bad" person at the beginning, but at the same time, you can't be called "good." As we progress through life and decided whether or not to learn from our mistakes, experiences, and the world around us, we begin to define ourselves and society seems to feel the need to label everyone "good" or "bad."    Also, people can't help but feel in a certain way at times, even if they fight against it or ignore it, it won't change the fact that they feel angry or calm, giving or greedy, or happy or sad. We just don't have a lot of control over our emotions at times, and that can drive us to do things we know we shouldn't.

oi4LXCgLaa	Sumguy, Brazil's black population is 50%    USA is 13% but you have to remember also that not all Afro-Americans are pure black...There are numerous Afro-Americans have native american/english ancestry.    Barack Obama would count as a Pardo.    So that makes Brazil a more concentrated Black country. I also traveled to Brazil and seen first hand that Brazil have alot of African-Ancestry more so than the USA|`|00b5UjqBaa	I know...are we supposed to go around declaring it night and day?|`|yGQgdYNwaa	Really..i don't ignore it.

I'm tlkin white/black etc|`|Q42sjWciaa	Not every African-American person knows it, so they aren't really ignoring anything. Besides, the population of a certain race or ethnicity does not always affect a totally different place.|`|ht5CQV04aa	Very nice?|`|So2Jgtzyaa	Sumguy you are wrong have to agree with that guy....6.9% of the population "considers" themselves BLACK. The other 40% are African origin also, just as dark as Barack Obama. What would be considered "Pardo" if this word ever existed    So YES Brazil has a more concentrated/populated BLACK COUNTRY  That goes for the rest of Latin America who has blacks all over (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Rep, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecudaor, ect ect|`|kSSlzrufaa	- I thought Black Americans embraced this idea but I am on a Brazilian website and some will tell you that there are more blacks in Brazil based on the American racial classification system but in Brazil they feel differently because their racial classification system is different    - Most Brazilians have their "foot in the kitchen" as they call it which means African ancestry but how many identify as black as opposed to mulatto is where the problem comes in|`|bb06GQ5Paa	We know that.  So what's your point?|`|uQfJukisaa	We don't ignore it, it's just some people weren't aware of that fact and for the ones that do know it doesn't really come up that often.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	we dont ignore that- white Brazilians on y/a ignores that.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	I didn't even know until today o_o besides they don't show a lot of black Brazilians on t.v. but now that i know what exactly are we suppose to do about that?|`|aUScPZFYaa	I agree with cocoa butter. Black Latinos aren't shown on TV like the white ones. People don't realize that we are Black also. The real Brazilians are dark like Africans.    6.9% of the population? I heard that half of Brazil had Black ancestry. Most of the Brazilians I see are very dark and they look darker than me and most Africans.A lot of this Latin American countries like to lie about their statistics.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Well, Afro-Brazilians only make up 6.9% of Brazil's population, our black population is almost 13% AND we have about double Brazil's population, so we have WAY more black people in the U.S. than Brazil.    (Pardo people are mixed race, some are white-black and a huge portion are white-Native, native-white, also known as mestizo make up the largest part of the Pardo population [42%])    BTW: I don't ignore anything, I rarely even talk or think about Brazil on a daily basis. No disrespect.|`|UnG3dS7xaa	I know it and I acknowledge it. It doesn't necessarily mean much here though as you've provided 0 context, which is why this question confuses me.

tBtHiPLGaa	What are some of ya talking about?  Doing your know what Euthanasia is?  Euthanasia hasn't nothing to do with Asia and it's isn't a girl.  Euthanasia is pretty mess ending someones life in a painless way.  To answer your question:  I'm like on the fence about this.  I think if someone has a horrible diseases or was paralysis and want to die than that their business.  I think the patient should have a choice in it since it's their life being taken.  I don't think other people should be in control of if the patient should die.  My mom's mom die by euthanasia, because my mom's aunt didn't want to pay for life support anymore so they withdraw her off it.  I don't think we should be going around killing people.  But I think if the person whom paying for that person to be alive and don't have money for it anymore and no one else has money to pay for than I think it's ok.  Since I don't think others should be going broken and homeless because of this.  This is a very touchy subject.  I think it's lays mainly in the patient hands especially if they can speak on it, but also in the person whom paying for it like the family members since it do effect they too especially if they are on life support.|`|OtfSP7kHaa	I think she's pretty...in a killer kind of way.|`|teeQmWsBaa	I think the youth in Asia are much like they are in all countries.|`|W7l1awFPaa	I don't agree with the practice of euthanasia.  Sometimes people are depresses or in a lot of pain and they think it will never get better so they ask to die.  There was an example where an older lady was suffering from cancer and even asked the doctor to help her.  This was in a country where this is legal but her granddaughter talked her out of it.  Eventually she recovered from cancer and thanked her granddaughter.  Self murder is still murder.|`|yj5YeCvaaa	I think people should have the right to die if they want to. Yes technically it is "wrong", but it is ultimately up to the individual if they want to live or die. Who are we to stop someone if they really have their hearts set on it, especially if they are already dying or in a lot of pain. People must choose their own destinies.|`|9g8spRvPaa	I think in some cases it should be done out of mercy.  Just yesterday I attended a class on senior care for an agency I was thinking of working for.  I have really changed my mind about working for them and will be looking into something else.  It was horrible to me to watch training video's of people being forced before they die to wear diapers and use bed pans etc. Not much dignity in it.  personally, I hope I die long before my body breaks down that much.
jqkyJyUdaa	"To the ancient Greeks, Fate was personified in the form of three sisters: Clotho, who spun the thread of life; Lachesis, who measured the length of the thread; and Atropos, smallest of the three but the most powerful, who snipped the thread at her whim."    That was a quote from Dean Koontz's Mr. Murder. Also, check out some of these websites.    http://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moirae  http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Moirai.html    I hope those will help. Curious though, out of all the great tales that greek mythology has to offer, why pick the fates?|`|hz7oaQeqaa	The three fates.  Listen up.  In a nutshell, they decided how long a person was to live.  Using "threads" that stood for peoples lives.  The fates were:    Clotho: Spun the thread of life.  Each persons life was a single thread she created.    Lachesis: Measured the thread.  She decided how long that thread would be(how long the person would live)    Atropos:  Cutter of the thread.  She would cut the thread of life and cause that person to die on earth in the manner that SHE chose, be it peacefully in sleep or horribly in war.

Believe me if you are in fact gay and you come to terms with reality life will be allot easier. You don't know what you are missing gay guys are great. You are battling with what Society want for you not what you want for yourself. Take a step back and stop telling yourself you love woman. Think about it really think about it could I be in love with a man. I tell you what I think you need to find a copy of the tv show Queer as Folk. Make yourself watch one episode. Then after that episode ask yourself again am I gay. Do this ok.|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	Well, what if you were gay. Perhaps you already have your answer. Would you be upset if you were gay?  Would you be happy?  I always think, what would happen if i died in my sleep tonight. I don't want to, its just my mind playing tricks on me.   The best way to get over this is to figure out the answer to 'what if i am gay' and resolve that thought. Perhaps if you felt ok about being gay, it would stop you worrying about it and you could go back to being a happy straight person without these thoughts getting to you.    Vik

Lets not call them Muslim ; lets call them Pakistani , or Egyptian , or Afghanistani .. why pick the religion?    Those people are idiots who use the word of religion and fight for other reasons. For the fact that Americans are raping their mothers , so JIHADDDDDDDDD. But our prophet told us '' Set your enemies to the side , look at the right side , only war declared because of religion ''   and in this case no ones fighting you to become Muslim. No ones coming to your home and forcing you either.    Islam talks about charity it is the FIRST pillar. Islam is rules , put with orders together in one holy book.  You know the banks that havent flunk are the ones following Islamic rules??? I GUESS NOT.    So mind it please.    EDIT:   I want to add the fact that Islam means submission to peace ; if you say Islam is violent , you say the bible and the torah is too. Because Islam has been so nice that we accepted the words of the bible and the torah. You know what the Imam said to me when I said " My friend wants to convert to Islam , sir , What should I do ? "   he said " If she says I believe in one god , and mohammed is his prophet " she will there on be a Muslim.  And you know what Mohammed said about Christians and Jews " they are the people of the book , believing in one god , there is NO NEED , to convert them unless they are willing to "     I would also like to state the fact that back in that time the Roman , Iranian , Egyptian , Arabian , Kush , Indian , Byzantine empires were all around , it was a rough time , and dying was a regular thing and something that always happened. Do you ever think why everyone in Elizebethean time played swords? Even little 5 year olds ? It was no big whoop. Right now its exaggerated and thought as OH MY GOD IT IS HORRIBLE. I dont disagree with that , but Islam is not changing , the people are. The book hasnt been changed unlike other religious text , thats why it might seem so cruel and harsh to you. Right? Take a deeper look and put yourself in that time and think about Mohammed accepting their religion even after them saying NO YOU CANT BE A PROPHET and SPITTING IN HIS FACE , BEATING , ETC. Everyone screamed to him , declare war! declare war. And he said no. That is exactly why he is such a darling and the most successful too.      Prophet Mohammed was no God , he was like you , like me , and orphan at the age of 6 , born to a poor family.|`|M6U7jVoQaa	Quran preachs peace to the peaceful, and war to the agressors. It teaches to respond when you are attacked. But stops aggression and wants peace to make peace. and not to aggress anybody who is peaceful    (2:190)  Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors.     (8-61) And if they incline to peace, incline thou also to it, and trust in Allah. Lo! He, even He, is the Hearer, the Knower.       why it looks like most terrorist are muslims?  Media have a role. They call any muslim who fight for his land a terrorist. While there exist real terrorists (alqaeda, bombay terrorism..etc) these people are using religious cheating and political situations to recruit guillible people into fighting USA seen as the cause of all their misery    Media do not shed much light on many terrorist in China, Africa (rwanda, Liberia) Sri Lanka, Bassque, Columbia, Peru, Mexico, Israeli IDF,...etc|`|e3vQ4BWaaa	In brief :        This is what your Media stresses on ... there are lots of terrorists from the other religions surrounding the world but the Media made a stress on The Muslims because of 11/9 and Bin Laden ...

Q7EN2Zqbaa	I think your friend might be alone on this one.  People are shallow, yes, but I don't know anyone who would refuse to talk to someone because of their looks. You should try to help this friend of yours out, that's a sad way to live. I think outside of north america people in general do care about looks to a degree, but they have a broader definition of good-looking.  Here, you've got to look good in a pretty specific way to be noticed for it.     edit: oh, I see.  I've never been fortunate enough to leave North America, the internet saves me from being a complete ignoramous.  Did you go somewhere where people had money like Europe, or to a third-world country or something?  Because I guess we could just be spoiled over here.    edit: Cool, I'm Canadian too and go to the states all the time, you're right that our lifestyles are more or less Identical. Looking at the Countrys you've been to it seems like we might just be spoiled here. That, and my bros went to South Africa(a part heavily populated with Zulus, few white people) a couple months back and they said that everyone there just treated white folks especially really well for some reason so that could be it too. Where aboot in Canada are you from may I ask? :P    edit: aww, you totally rock!  That's my all time favorite place to be in Canada, BC is so beautiful.  I'm all the way in Ontario so trips there are few and far between but I can't wait 'til the next time I get to visit.    edit: K, you gotta cut me some slack, I'm a bit of a douchebag. A monkey would have figured out that you're not white by your avatar but leave it to me... Anyways, you're question's become a bit of a conundrum to me, only thing that makes sense is that we just have it too easy here compared to the third world, we could definitely learn from those folks. Also It could always be the area you live in in particular that people aren't so nice, I know where I live like one in a million people will be rude to me when I go to talk to them. And haha no, I'm not racist(as if saying that means anything) I think the standard way to prove it nowadays is to tell you about all my black friends but I don't want to be cliche so, take my word for it?    edit: anytime, it's been fun, do me a favor and take a shot at mine?(no obligation):    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    that one's been plaguing my mind forever|`|7f5163fa20e31d2a79b5e10f9f0d65cfaa	You have phrased this question as if your perception is reality. It's not. Some people hate ugly people is true, but not a universal truth. Beauty is often in the eye of the beholder. I think your friend has self esteem issues that make her appear shallow but it's really all about how she feels about herself.

qjcrMtdhaa	1. Don't look at a gifted horse's teeth.   2. A bird is worth more in hand then 100 flying.   3. Even though the monkey wears silk, he's still a monkey.  4. It's better to be a rat's head then a lion's tail.     They all old time proverbs.    The first one comes from an old phrase from when they use to give horses as gifts. It was considered rude to look at the horse's teeth (to check it's health) since it was a gift.     The second one talks about how if you have one bird in your hand, you're better off then if you had 100 flying away. (From that phrase "If you love her, let her go. If she really loves you, she'll come back and if not, she'll fly away)    The third one is a way of saying, even if you dress up a street-rat, he's still a street-rat.     The fourth one is a rephrase of a something we have here in the US: "better to be the big fish in a small pond, than the small fish in a big pond"|`|b9fXwehraa	don't look at a gift horse's tooth/ don't look a gift horse in the mouth    a bird in the hand is worth more than 100 on the wing/ a bird in hand is worth two in the bush    although the monkey dresses in silk, a monkey it remains/ you cant make a silk purse out of a sow's ear    it's better to be the head of a rat than the tail of a lion  if you can't run with the big dogs, stay on the porch|`|HenrM5Zbaa	1.

P544Sbmqaa	Well, I guess there is rarely literally no open jobs.  However, even the local fast food joints are getting hundreds of apps for a handful of jobs.  There may be some open jobs, but there are NOT enough open jobs for everyone to work right now.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Because they're not the type of jobs they necessarily want or is appropriate to their work experience and educational level.  Let's be real: how many mid-level to senior executives or highly skilled workers are going to want to work at McDonald's, Wal-Mart or be a janitor or waitress or telemarketer for minimum wage?  Those sorts of dreary low paying soul destroying jobs seem to be the only jobs getting advertised these days. It's pretty discouraging.    Saying no to such jobs is not always a matter of laziness.  There's nothing wrong with being selective and finding the appropriate job if you're able to do so.|`|19ZvkHqraa	Because people don't want to work for less than what they were making before they got laid off.|`|AA12215623	There are no jobs,idiot.

I am still sick to my stomach from the training video's I saw.   Yes, I have job for you if you are willing to change **** bags and piss buckets and washing an adults *** while spoon feeding them.  I do admire anyone that could do su`ch a job but it defiantly isn't for everyone.|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	Oftentimes, just any job won't serve the person's purposes.  They need a job that pays them enough to maintain their lifestyle and won't make them want to put a bullet in their brain.  If you got laid off from a 60k salary job and are in danger of losing your house, a minimum wage job isn't really going to help you.
W0rcm3awaa	I don't believe in creationism but the fact of the matter is that evolution is not fact. Microevolution is fact sure, but i'm almost positive that you're referring to Macro evolution.    Micro is darwin's finishes, linear and occuring over a small period of time, you could also call it adaptation. It's small changes within a species that allow it to survive.     Macro evolution has never been proven and is quite different. Macro spans millions of years is branching and theorizes species jumps which again haven't been proven. For one if species jumps are true why don't we have the fossils of the inbetween species, we haven't even found one and if this occurs over millions of years shouldn't we find at least one - although in reality we should find more. Some scientists say this is because their bones didnt' solidify but how can that be. For one how did they survive long enough to reproduce without solidified bones (remember this occurs over millions of years) and if their bones didn't solidify then how did ours? There are major holes in this theory it is almost certainly far from fact.    All of us on earth are carbon b ased and made of similar components. Not to mention Monkeys may be close to us in layout but not overall. Rat milk is the closest to human milk out of any animal, pig organs match ours more than any animal, and yes monkeys have aposable thumbs, not really concrete evidence in my opinion.    I'm open to the fact that maybe it is true, but as of right now it is not fact, its just as crazy as creationism right now to be honest.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Evolution disproves all creation myths, including the biblical one, as well as the notion that death and disease are the fault of humans.|`|3r252UIRaa	Because they take the creation myth literally.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I don't know how to break this to you...but there isn't any evidence for macro evolution (one species jumping from another).....at all.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Because they put evolution with atheists and they want nothing to do with anything in any relation to us.

If the Bible said something that contradicted relativity, they wouldn't believe in relativity.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Religion is a myth, and by admitting the Evolution is a proven scientific fact, they have to give up on one of the tenants of their belief.  This weakens their over-all faith.  THey are unwilling to do this, in fear of facing some eternal punishment from their loving and benevolent God.  Evolution also proves there creation story is untrue, and most of there other beliefs are on shaky ground as well, so they want to hold on to them, no matter how illogical it sounds.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	It's a messy situation. Ultimately it's an issue they can't win: the facts are simply irrefutable, and the only way they can stay confident is to avoid the real data and keep passing lies and errors between themselves.

GOD bless|`|AA11297267	Wow, the intelligence level is low today.    You just have to laugh at the christians who toss out "did you see evolution happen? NO!" as a proof it's not a fact, then claim the bible has all the facts.  Did they see any bible events happen?  NO!  Yet they see no contradiction...    As a matter of fact, folks, I *have* seen evolution happen.  And you can watch it happen, too.  Go google "antibiotic resistant bacteria" and you can watch a time-lapse movie that shows evolution happening, right before your eyes.  Go to a museum of natural history some time, and you can see all those transitional fossils proving "macro" evolution, any time you want to.  Go open a book other than the bible, and you can read about (and verify for yourself) the hundreds of thousands of pieces of evidence demonstrating the fact of evolution by natural selection.  Ah, but I guess none of them will do that -- it requires effort, learning, using their brain.  They'd rather just take some bombastic pastor's word for it that god did it all 6,000 years ago, because that doesn't require any effort, and it makes them feel all warm and fuzzy.    Delusion indeed.

You see, the whole logical positivist approach to reality has been dead for half a century now, and the real thinkers know this.

And, if that few have even read the texts, just think how many more there are that don't even know about the religion they claim. It comes down to ill education on the part of those that practice the religion.  If one knows the religion and history of the faith, texts, people, and culture - one can know what is and isn't real in the texts.    THAT being said - if they don't know and are only listening to what some man says on Sunday morning, how can they really be excepted to believe in Evolution? They can't even really believe their own faith, let alone science.|`|pYimIJAWaa	Yup, they'll eat bacon for breakfast and pork roast for Sunday after-church dinner, but insist that the creation story (somehow, in both its contradictory versions), is the literal truth.

We have enough wisdom to clone people and do all kinds of amazing stuff."  God listened patiently and then said, "Very well, let's have a man-making contest.  We'll do it like I did in the old days with Adam."  The scientist agreed, and one of them bent down and picked up a hand-ful of dirt.  God looked at him and said,"No!  You have to make your own dirt!"    Mr. WellTraveledProg, I am not going to argue if bacteria is alive or not with you.  Nor will I argue that they mutate.    But scientificaly speaking science has no means what so ever of seeing or testing evolution.

The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand.    "You're a Christian, aren't you, son?"     "Yes, sir."     "So you believe in God?"     "Absolutely."     "Is God good?"     "Sure! God's good."     "Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?"     "Yes."     " Are you good or evil?"     "The Bible says I'm evil."     The professor grins knowingly. "Ahh! THE BIBLE!" He considers for a moment. "Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over here and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help them? "Would you try?"     "Yes sir, I would."     "So you're good...!"     "I wouldn't say that."     "Why not say that? You would help a sick and maimed person if you could... in fact most of us would if we could... God doesn't." [No answer.]     "He doesn't, does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Hmmm? Can you answer that one?"     [No answer]     The elderly man is sympathetic. "No, you can't, can you?" He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax. In philosophy, you have to go easy with the new ones. "Let's start again, son."     "Is God good?"     "Er... Yes."     "Is Satan good?"     "No."     "Where does Satan come from?"     The student falters. "From... God..."     "That's right. God made Satan, didn't he?" The elderly man runs his bony fingers through his thinning hair and turns to the smirking, student audience. "I think we're going to have a lot of fun this semester, ladies and gentlemen." He turns back to the Christian. "Tell me, son. Is there evil in this world?"     "Yes, sir."     "Evil's everywhere, isn't it? Did God make everything?"     "Yes."     "Who created evil?     [No answer]     "Is there sickness in this world? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness. All those terrible things - do they exist in this world? "     The student squirms on his feet. "Yes."     "Who created them? "     [No answer]     The professor suddenly shouts at his student. "WHO CREATED THEM? TELL ME, PLEASE!"The professor closes in for the kill and climbs into the Christian's face. In a still small voice: "God created all evil, didn't He, son?"     [No answer]     The student tries to hold the steady, experienced gaze and fails. Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace the front of the classroom like an aging panther. The class is mesmerized.    "Tell me," he continues, "How is it that this God is good if He created all evil throughout all time?" The professor swishes his arms around to encompass the wickedness of the world. "All the hatred, the brutality, all the pain, all the torture, all the death and ugliness and all the suffering created by this good God is all over the world, isn't it, young man?"     [No answer]     "Don't you see it all over the place? Huh?" Pause.    "Don't you?" The professor leans into the student's face again and whispers, "Is God good?"     [No answer]     "Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?"     The student's voice betrays him and cracks. "Yes, professor. I do."     The old man shakes his head sadly. "Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you seen Him? "     "No, sir. I've never seen Him."     "Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?"     "No, sir. I have not."     "Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelled your Jesus... in fact, do you have any sensory perception of your God whatsoever?"     [No answer]     "Answer me, please."     "No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't."     "You're AFRAID... you haven't?"     "No, sir."     "Yet you still believe in him?"     "...yes..."     "That takes FAITH!" The professor smiles sagely at the underling. "According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your God doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son? Where is your God now?"     [The student doesn't answer]     "Sit down, please."     The Christian sits...Defeated(?).     Another Christian raises his hand. "Professor, may I address the class?"     The professor turns and smiles. "Ah, another Christian in the vanguard! Come, come, young man. Speak some proper wisdom to the gathering."     The Christian looks around the room. "Some interesting points you are making, sir. Now I've got a question for you if that's okay. Is there such thing as heat?"     "Yes," the professor replies, frowning. "There's heat."     "Is there such a thing as cold?"     "Yes, son, there's cold too."     "No, sir, there isn't."     The professor's grin freezes.     The room suddenly goes very cold. The second Christian continues. "You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat but we don't have anything called 'cold'.     We can hit 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't g|`|2pvtnd0gaa	why are monkeys still around if evolution is true?   where are the in between stages of man and monkey?|`|M6U7jVoQaa	I am muslim, and i found no problem with Evolution|`|ctCBcw41aa	Just because you believe that evolution is a fact doesn't mean that its true. You might believe that its true but The Bible says otherwise. Now the idea of evolution was made because some people refuse the fact that God does exist and that he created the world. So they want to refuse the knowledge that God exists so they live in the lie they now believe that God doesn't exist and he didn't make earth. So let me ask you a question why don't you accept the fact that God created the world? thank you. I was against God and creation before I dealt with the facts i didn't run to stupidity and foolishness to block out pure honesty that God exists. I don't mean to be cruel to some of you evolutionist who honestly don't buy into creation, but you should take responsibility for knowing the evidence for creation just as you know that god created the earth.|`|pbT0tJvqaa	I do know the evidence for evolution. It is admitted lies and you still believe it.     S. J. GOULD, Harvard, "The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have dta only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not the evidence of the fossils.", Nat. His., V.86, p.13    Here is Gould saying plainly that what is in our textbooks is inference and not evidence.     COLIN PATTERSON, Senior Paleontologist, British Museum of Nat. History, "You say I should at least 'show a photo of the fossil from which each type or organism was derived.' I will lay it on the line-there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument." "It is easy enough to make up stories of how one form gave rise to another. ... But such stories are not part of science, for there is no way of putting them to the test. ... I don't think we shall ever have any access to any form of tree which we can call factual." HARPER'S, Feb. 1984, p.56    Again we have a scientist telling us that what is taught is just stories and not actually science.     STEPHEN J. GOULD, Harvard, Lecture at Hobart & William Smith College, 14/2/1980. "Every paleontologist knows that most species don't change. That's bothersome....brings terrible distress. ...They may get a little bigger or bumpier but they remain the same species and that's not due to imperfection and gaps but stasis. And yet this remarkable stasis has generally been ignored as no data. If they don't change, its not evolution so you don't talk about it."    Gould again saying that things do not change in the fossil record.     S.J. GOULD, Harvard, "We can tell tales of improvement for some groups, but in honest moments we must admit that the history of complex life is more a story of multifarious variation about a set of basic designs than a saga of accumulating excellence....I regard the failure to find a clear 'vector of progress' in life's history as the most puzzling fact of the fossil record....we have sought to impose a pattern that we hoped to find on a world that does not really display it.", Natural His., 2/82, p.22     Gould again saying that scientists are IMPOSING A PATTERN WE HOPED TO FIND BUT DID NOT FIND.     W.E. SWINTON, "The origin of birds is largely a matter of deduction. There is no fossil evidence of the stages through which the remarkable change from reptile to bird was achieved." BIOLOGY & COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY OF BIRDS Vol. 1, p.1.     Here we have scientists telling us that they have deducted something without and evidence.    D.S. WOODROFF, Univ. of CA, San Diego, "But fossil species remain unchanged throughout most of their history and the record fails to contain a single example of a significant transition." Science, Vol.208, 1980, p.716    A.C. SEWARD, Cambridge, PLANT LIFE THROUGH THE AGES, p.561, "The theoretically primitive type eludes our grasp; our faith postulates its existence but the type fails to materialize."    A scientist telling us that they have faith in what they say but not evidence.     "WE KNEW BETTER", NILES ELDREDGE, Columbia Univ., American Museum Of Natural History, "And it has been the paleontologist my own breed who have been most responsible for letting ideas dominate reality: .... We paleontologist have said that the history of life supports that interpretation [gradual adaptive change], all the while knowing that it does not.", TIME FRAMES, 1986, p.144     Again a scientist admitting that they could not find any evidence.    Valentine (Univ. of CA) & Erwin (MI St. Univ), "We conclude that...neither of the contending theories of evolutionary change at the species level, phyletic gradualism or punctuated equilibrium, seem applicable to the origin of new body plans.", Development As An Evolutionary Process, p.96, 1987.

We discover more every decade about our universe that disproves biblical references.     And the church changes it's story every time something new comes out. They believed the Earth was thousands of years old. Then we found out its Millions of years old.     I think we'll get to the point in the future where science will disprove Christianity. And then the Christians will have nothing left to fall back on except to say that science is wrong and the work of the devil.|`|89MKzLl3aa	If you only believe in the literal interpretation then by implication, you are dismissing all of Jesus' teachings, since he taught mostly by telling parables.

It describes a process that occurs post-origin.    The only theological stance that evolution interferes with is Creationism.  Otherwise, the theory of evolution and Christianity are fully compatible.  Same with the Big Bang.    The Bible expresses eternal truth.  In this way, nothing within it is wrong, even if there are some thing that don't agree with science.

Which simply means that such interpretations are WRONG. Why should this come as a surprise, given that the beliefs of each Protestant denomination contradict the beliefs of the others, yet all such beliefs supposedly came right out of the Bible!  Truth cannot contradict truth, so it is obvious that many of the beliefs such denominations are preaching are WRONG!  Why not just be humble enough to look at the scientific evidence honestly, and say, "gee, maybe my biblical interpretations aren't infallible after all".  Instead of stubbornly clinging to biblical interpretations that any rational person knows are wrong since they contradict objective reality!|`|jCgnnWmuaa	If you believe that evolution is true then how did you get the knowledge and the intelligence to accept the facts as evidence?

Love your God above all and your neighbor as yourself.    Jesus himself said that was really all you needed to know. The rest is commentary.      And science is science. Like it or not, its methods give it an insurmountable edge over interpretation of ancient texts as a way to build a cosmology.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Hell's teeth, the clowns are out in force tonight.      You face a strange dilemma.  Most people who have recognized the truth of evolution have also abandoned the idea that Genesis provides any historical or scientific information.  Pro-evolution literalists are relatively rare.    Your science is fine, let's look at your theology.  Genesis was written in the form we have it now early in the first millennium BC.  Behind it lie centuries of oral tradition that we can no longer access.  The stories in those first chapters drew on and modified the legends of surrounding cultures, shaping them into a new myth in which the main protagonist would be the god of the Hebrews.    So far, so very unlikely to be the direct dictation of God.  We are looking at a chunk of literature here, a human artefact, which has a rich and complex history.    One creation story is told in Genesis 1: - 2.4.  Then we start again in the garden of Eden.  In various ways the two stories don't match, and this is significant.  We are not being given a seamless narrative, but rather two contrasting perspectives.  In the first story, human beings, male and female, are created in quantity.  Only in the second story do we find it suggested that God only made two people, first a man, then a woman; but even here there are suggestions that "Adam" is not so much a discrete individual but a representative figure, Everyman we might say.  Can ANYONE take both stories literally, when they don't even tally with each other?    And what about the idea that light was created before we hear of anything, such as a sun, that might have emitted it; or that all the trees and plants made on the third day pinged into existence with the appearance of being much older than they really were?  Trying to take Genesis literally piles absurdity on absurdity.    Once you realize that the early chapters of Genesis are legendary, the difficulties vanish and you can appreciate the book not as a "fairy tale", as ignorant atheists love to say - thereby proving they don't know the first thing about literature, even fairy tales - but as a piece of theology expressed as narrative.    Genesis and science do not contradict, any more than modern cosmology is contradicted by Star Trek, and for the same reason.  They are not trying to do the same thing.  Genesis isn't about explanations, and evolutionary science isn't trying to explore what it means for us to be "human".    Literalism spells death to Biblical understanding.|`|16EYP0Xiaa	The Bible was never meant to be a scientific textbook...it was meant to be a guide for living.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	You may no that evolution is true, buy many of us in the field haven't gotten that|`|KAI2WUqpaa	evolution true, Bible false...case closed|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Yes.|`|bce49af4b285a96d81e7186b9e756de9aa	what truth value    look, i'm willing to admit that there are variations within a species (2-headed albino snakes) but any deal that says that any species has evolved into another is blasphemy.|`|KmULmT7Baa	No, evolution contradicts creationism.

To me, evolution is part of science and bible is part of mythology.|`|pLt3DzOgaa	i do not belive in the bible nor any religeon either, but some arguements i have heard inclede "god created the opportunity for nature to evolve itself to create an organism that is just right." like leaving jelly to set.     other smart *** religeous people may answer the statement "the big bang was the creation of the universe" with "well who made the big bang"|`|JKtthwaMaa	What if God created everything to evolve? The Bible is basically a guideline towards leading a "good spiritual" life.     Evolution is part of life, and God created life.|`|AA12255473	wow.   you know for sure that evolution is true.      ok,  then I rest my case oh wise one.   were you around a million years ago?  a thousand?  has anybody ever been able to witness a case of something evolve accross species lines?    I'll tell you what I believe,  Evolution is hogwash and the Bible is true and the two cannot coexist.  End of story.|`|xHcQSLiVaa	Yes.  What if God invented evolution.  Our main problem is literal interpretation.  Is mankind perfect?  Who put pen to paper?  Who chose the passages?  If your answer is God told them what to do, then think about this, He is telling me to tell you they can coexist because of him.  Did not even God change from the old to the new testament?|`|bn8X2YdRaa	The bible is to be taken metaphorically (my belief) so these stories don't disprove the bible. They didn't have the technology that we have, so they pass down these made up stories to explain things such as the creation and ect.|`|JIATcwW6aa	Of course the two can coexist.  Ones spirituality or religious beliefs do not have to be dependent on dispelling the fact that evolution exists.  Does it mean man evolved from apes?  Absolutely not.      Scientists continue to search for answers to questions, as do Christians or any other "religion".  To assume one has all the answers without ever questioning is a sign of ape-like behavior, just accepting what someone else tells you as the truth.  Scientific fact is proven.  The Bible is based on some historical facts.  Other than that, it is left up to individual interpretations.    I was raised in the Catholic Church (Christian, for those of you who are too ignorant to acknowledge that fact), and I was exposed to the theory that the Bible contains parables so that people could understand the content.  Well, that makes more sense to me than anything I've run across in some 50 years of my life.  And I'm always seeking answers.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	I don't know how to 'prove' this to you.  I can only say that in most of Europe, most Christians accept evolution.  The pope accepts evolution, the Archbishop of Canterbury accepts evolution.    Your problem appears to derive from your sense that the Bible must be 'literally' true.  Why do you feel this way?  Almost every Jew in the world (of which I'm one) and the majority of Christians understand those creation stories in Genesis as metaphorical - telling us a great truth about the nature of our relationship with G-d, but not intended in any way to be literal truth.  To force wonderful symbolic stories into mundane literalism seems to me to demean their force and wonder.  If you insist on literality, it's all a bit flat, not to mention some awkward contradictions.  As soon as you accept metaphor (used in every ancient writing we know of), a rich and glorious world opens up.  Then, the sense of the divine can resonate deeply within us rather than being mind-based, reductionist and more about guilt and difficulty.|`|5hD0alFyaa	How would it be possible to discard the Bible as mostly wrong and still hold to the fact that Jesus is the Son of God? What parts are right and what parts are wrong? If the fist book of the Bible cannot be trusted to be true in it's literal interpretation then none of the Bible can be trusted. God would then either not exist or he is a lier. For the simple fact is that the God of the Bible and evolution cannot both be true. You cannot change the meaning of the Bible to make it compatible with evolution without making it untrustworthy in every part.    I'm not going to try and convince you that evolution is wrong because I simply don't have the time for that right now, but if you want to discuss this further email me sometime and we can talk in more detail. All I will say is that I believe that the Bible is the inerrant word of God and is to be trusted in every part and interpretend literally, God is true and evolution is not. They cannot coexist.|`|hwqwNKHyaa	Some people believe that evolution is one of the many power of gods. Gives you something to think about, doesn't it?|`|Uoahij9qaa	"All I know is that evolution is true and it contradicts the literal interpretation of the Bible"    That's correct.    "which is the only interpretation that makes sense to me"    I can hardly tell you what interpretations will make sense to you, but many people find that allegorical or other interpretations make sense to them.|`|n1T31CNkaa	The Bible teaches that man was created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26,27). The unproved theory of evolution claims instead that man gradually evolved from lower animals. Supposedly an accident occurred millions of years ago, producing the first simple living thing. Then it gradually developed into all the present kinds of plants and animals: fish, reptiles, birds, mammals, and finally man. So life is just an accident and man is just an advanced animal. Please consider some questions.    1) Where did the first living thing come from? It is a proven scientific fact that life comes only from life. Every living thing comes from a previous living thing. Science has thoroughly disproved the ancient theory of spontaneous generation. How, then, did that first living thing spontaneously generate, as evolution claims?    2) Where is the proof that all current kinds of living things have developed from previous kinds? Science confirms that living things reproduce after their own kind, just as our everyday experience indicates, and just as the Bible states (Genesis 1:11,21,24,25). Dogs produce other dogs, not monkeys or men. For years scientists have searched for the fossil remains of "missing links"  organisms half-way between modern plants and animals. If evolution is true, there should be thousands of such intermediate fossils. Instead, there are none. Why?    3) Why are humans so unique compared to animals? Among animals there are many minute differences in intelligence, but a vast gulf exists between men and animals. Why do animals never read, write, or solve math problems? Why do they not invent new machines, train animals, use fire, or record their discoveries for posterity? Why does only man create new works of art, music, and poetry? If man is just an animal, evolved from lower animals, why don't other animals do these almost as well as we do?    The only honest explanation for the scientific evidence is the one given all along in the Bible. Man did not evolve. We were created in the image of God, and that is why we ought to serve Him.|`|UHHehNDaaa	How can you call evolution true when Stephen Jay Gould said himself that there isn't enough evidence in the fossil record to support evolution?  It's a good things penguins are still alive or else you'd be telling me that humans came from birds just because they walk upright.    The bible is 100% true my friend, hopefully you will open your mind a little more.|`|cws5BuO3aa	I believe that adaptation and Christianity coexist. Adaptation is really just a form of evolution. I believe that God is there teaching us things though. Otherwise, how would humans know what manners are? How would we know that it is wrong to kill your brother? I believe there is enough geological evidence to say that evolution occurs to a degree. After all, no one said that Adam and Eve looked like modern humans. No one said that all the animals were the exact same then as they are now. I believe that God certainly controls evolution though, and I do not believe that humans came from monkeys. I hope this helped!|`|3cqfxNxlaa	Ok, first i would ask you the question how do you know evolution is true? Then i would like to simply say, personally, i do not believe evolution is true. Because simply it just doesn't work it involves a lot of circular reasoning. It also takes more to believe a theory that its founder denounced before his death; than it does to believe an almighty God spoke the world into existence. Feel free to send me an e-mail with your views and comments.|`|DOcjGDVQaa	hmm very good question...    There are actually a lot of scientists that dont agree 100% with evolution and their  motives are not "religion" based. Here is some information:    http://www.darwinismandid.com/questions/...    http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/    http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org/t...    The thing is, people blindly believe what they are taught, whether it be  creationism or evolution.    I think you need to remember how technologically inferior people were when the bible was written. In science today humans are growing organs out of laboratories and doing some amazing things that people in biblical times would have thought "god-like". So i think it is definitely possible the world was created by god. in some cases in the bible you can find modern scientific knowledge e.g. when god tells Moses and his peeps about basic hygiene "do not eat shellfish, do not spill your seed on the ground" etc.    There are renouned scientists that are also ministers for religion. Which for some reason people believe is conflicting. obviously these scientists have come to their own conclusion regarding evolution and god and I think people should also do independent study and draw their own conclusions.      My opinion is some elements of both theories can coexist.    Im going to finish with 2 Tolstoy quotes:      "Freethinkers are those who are willing to use their minds without prejudice and without fearing to understand things that clash with their own customs, privileges, or beliefs. This state of mind is not common, but it is essential for right thinking;    You will die - and it will all be over. You will die and find out everything - or cease asking.|`|RLWOBOx1aa	http://www.faceeternity.com/bible.htm  -evidence for Bible from medicine, history........    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2fswCPeu...  -theory of relativity, big bang n religion go hand in hand.     Science n religion go hand it hand. Truth is that which is in accordance to reality. There is a spiritual realm, n its not subjective n in our brains!!     With a bit of science u can disprove religion, with a lot you can proove it. One has to be ignorant of many facts to reject truth.
MDnqaQ9yaa	Flowers aren't a MUST. If you don't get them, you should get a small gift to take the place of the flowers, like candy and a stuffed animal. It's cheaper, it goes to good use, and it won't die in three days, plus it's just as sweet as flowers.   As for dinner, it should be somewhere romantic and intimate, you know, a place where you guys can just spend time talking and enjoying each others company. Doing something fun afterwords is just whatever you'd think she'd like to do. If she likes bowling, then hey why not take her there? Just remember, Valentines day is about being with the one you care for, not how much money you spend.|`|aS8TjALBaa	Flowers are not mandatory.  In fact, V Day is not the greatest time to go out to dinner because of the crowds and service is not always the best.  I'd plan something before V Day and surprise her with your plans.  You could start with a small bouquet of fresh flowers that you can pick up from the market and a card.  Take her to a movie, dinner and then to get ice cream or something like that afterwards.  Put some thought into and surprise her in advance of the official day.|`|7SgVzX4daa	It doesn't matter if the flowers die. I find it still sweet! No, it doesn't have to be roses but I just think that it's a classic. My opinion there.    The dinner.. her favorite restraunt..! then maybe something fun.. it depends on where you live so I don't know what to do tell you to do after dinner.    Good luck!|`|iNBLWIFKaa	No, flowers are not necessary. They do wilt and die but it's the thought that counts. I would only recommend sending flowers to your girlfriend if they are being delivered at school or work. That way, there is a show-off factor!    BUT!  If you really, really want to get a good Valentine's Day gift, stick with jewelery. Here is a cute set of earrings I found. I recommend something like this. And they are not too expensive, either.   http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...

1UtVRoFHaa	A name is a name!   Why would you need what others say just go and see for yourself.   If she is you'll know soon because she will show you.   People talk SH!T about others all the time.   You need to be your own person and find out for yourself and learn what people are by knowing them not what others say.   Also remember the people that are talking about this person will also do the same to you so look out and make sure you don't add to the problem of "HATERS"|`|p2PQZvTzaa	Thats soo ignorant of them to call her a hoe and not even know the girl personally I bet!

OR, they are not planning for their future.  For example, take two families making the same amount your's does.  One may be putting back in IRAs and those things, while the other is not.    Also remember that 120,000 really is NOT that much in many areas.  For a LOT of places, that is run of the mill lower middle class.|`|QI74CxD0aa	Your friends' parents are either in a lot of debt or doing something illegal.

Instead of overextending himself and trying to live beyond his means, your father is using his money a little more responsibly.  The plus side for you?  When your folks die fifty years down the road, you won't have to use their life insurance money to pay off their mortgage, car, and other debts.  It also gives you a positive financial role model to follow, which will help you from getting into excessive debt yourself.

CCAQWT25aa	Hello there.    Youre right.  Relative clauses in English always take the indicative mood; well, unless they take a modal, for example, but then there is no mood at all. If were talking about mood, only the indicative is possible. This is indeed problematic when you have to translate into Spanish, because in Spanish relative clauses can take either mood, with a difference in meaning. This difference, in English, is usually inferred from context, and sometimes its just a mater of guessing, unfortunately, or of figuring out what makes more sense.    Ill give you an example:  "She wants to buy a house that has a swimming-pool."    This sentence (with the verb in the clause in the indicative mood) has two possible translations in Spanish, with different meanings:    1. Ella desea comprar una casa que tiene una piscina. (tiene = indicative)  2. Ella desea comprar una casa que tenga una piscina. (tenga = subjunctive)    In the first sentence, she has already seen the house she wants to buy, and it happens to have a swimming-pool.  In the second, she hasnt chosen a specific house yet, but she knows she wants one with a swimming-pool. She will buy a house if she finds one that has a swimming pool.    Unfortunately, there is no way, using a relative clause, to show this difference in English. If you have to translate a similar sentence from English into Spanish, you will have to examine the context of the sentence for hints about its meaning.    Good luck!      EDITED to clarify:  Let me explain what happened here and see if I can help.  Melinda fell prey of the "that trap", as I call what I'm going to explain now. She confused relative clauses with something called "that-clauses", perhaps because of the introductory word in both types. But thats the only thing they have in common. This is a mistake many students of English make; it doesnt seem easy for them, even at the upper-intermediate and advanced levels, to see the difference between both types of clause. The ones called "that-clauses" are nominal clauses.    The clauses in my examples are relative clauses, or adjectival clauses. They function in the way a predicative adjective would, postmodifying a noun. Thats their role. The introductory that is a relative pronoun and it ALWAYS has a syntactic function in the clause.    The clauses Melinda posted, and which she incorrectly calls relative, are in reality nominal clauses (or noun clauses). Nouns and adjectives dont function in the same way; neither do nominal and relative clauses. In Melina's sentences, the clauses are DIRECT OBJECTS, so they can't possibly be relative clauses, since an adjective or a structure with adjectival force can never be a direct object; its impossible. Verbs such as insist and demand, which she used, and several others such as suggest, recommend, order, propose and urge, require the use of the marked subjunctive (or some more informal constructions, such as should + infinitive) in that clauses, which are, I insist, nominal clauses. The subjunctive required by the that type of nominal clause is also used after expressions such as Its necessary, its commendable, its imperative, etc.  One more difference between these and relative clauses is that the word that, in nominal clauses, is NOT a relative pronoun but a subordinating conjunction and, also unlike what happens with relative clauses, its NEVER part of either the subject of the predicate of the clause.    As you can see, the differences between both clauses are many and clear. Yet, students often fail to distinguish one from the other. I wish I could explain why!    I hope this will help you to avoid confusing both types of clauses.      C.

HH90Eghaaa	No if that was the case we would see a lot of drug addicts saving the world, and that is simply not the case!|`|IFs6MWDJaa	I think so.  The other day i was the store, bagging my food, and the lady next to me forgot her big bag of dog food, I first thought about keeping it and putting it in my buggy since it was already paid for,  But then i picked it up and took of running after her b4 she got out of the store and gave it back.    Then while leaving the parking lot, so a go asking for money on the side of the road. and i have him a couple bucks, just cuz i felt good about doing one nice thing it made me wanna do another nice thing|`|sOeDTrPeaa	Nope. Schadenfreude is what rules when we do good.|`|iMky8dBsaa	Yes. If you are in a good mood you will probably be extra nice to people which will make them happy and make them want to do the same to someone else.
spbqfjvbaa	You're exes for a reason.  Let her go.  Right now she is stringing both of you (you & her bf) along by still being in a relationship with him, yet confessing her love for you.  If she was sleeping with you during the 1st month she was with him, that shows that she can't be trusted.    If she TRULY wants to be with you, she will be a mature woman & let her boyfriend go.  It sounds like before she gets into another relationship, she needs to figure out some things about herself 1st.  One big thing:  what's blocking her from taking the final step with you.  If she loves you so much, nothing will stop her from being with you.    I know that you have strong feelings for her, but is she REALLY worth your life (laying down in death for her)?  Because with everything you just wrote, she doesn't sound like she'd do the same for you.  And her words are sweet & loving & all, but all that talk without action doesn't mean squat.    Step back from this situation, because both of you need to take some time to think about things.  And one last thing:  If she cheated on her bf with you, what makes you think she won't do the same thing with you if & when she ever breaks up with her bf?|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Sounds like your girl wants her cake and wants to eat it too.I say you move on to someone you can trust and someone who will love you back as much as you love them.Good Luck to you.I wish you the best.|`|oxeAYFGzaa	OK well with out getting in to your personal life any more than you have let me in. I would say it seems like something from the past is what is stopping her from breaking it off with him and coming back to you. I would sit down with her and have an honest and open talk let her know how you feel and that you know that hearing that you have changed is different than seeing that you have, also ask her to explain why she thinks that she can't break it off. I ma not sure what you had to change but if you are able to show her you have changed that might help some as well.     I would also suggest that you all take a break from any sexual activity between the two of you until you get something worked out, because she might just like the sex and that is why she won't break it off with him.     As far as falling out of love...i personally don't believe that if you ever truly loved someone you can fall out of love with them so she is more than likely still in love with you and is scared of her feelings.      I hope everything works out for you and her. If you want someone to talk to or have other questions feel free to E-mail me.|`|ZNgJ6gi2aa	isn't this from some kind of teenage drama show?|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	Sounds like she is confused about her sexuality.I would wait ,but not too long to see if she wants to be in a relationship with you.If not you need to get on with your life.This on again off again situation must be very frustrating for you too.But anyway if she wants to be with you,Time will tell.Good Luck.

No is no and you need the medication to survive and live a good life.

XmJZkFuMaa	I support something like 20% nature, 80% nurture.  My religion is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon) but this has less to do with that and more to do with working with Pit Bulls when I was interning as an Animal Behaviorist.      Basically, I saw first hand that you can take a puppy from two fighting dogs and train it to be a great dog, friendly with other dogs, and having no problems.  I also saw that you could take a fighting dog and retrain it, but you had to take into account it's age.  For every bad experience with another dog the dog had had, you had to give them at least 9 good experiences before you could start to train the dog to be friendly.  So you had to think that for a 5 year old dog who had been fighting since 6 months old, you would have to do about 36 years of work of GOOD things around other dogs before you could get back to the square one of a dog where nothing bad had happened.    As for nature, I believe that the dog's physical make up does have an effect on the dog's behavior.  A hound dog is going to sniff and follow his nose more than a collie simply because it's far more rewarding for the hound dog than for the collie to use his nose.    How does all this affect religion?  I'm assuming you're pointing at crimes, homosexuality, and even indoctrination.  Well, basically I believe that there could be something that makes someone more inclined for a behavior, like the hound with his nose, that we haven't identified yet (or may be on the verge of identifying it.)  Like a hound with his nose, you can train them to not act without thinking on those inclinations, but the more positive experiences they have with acting on it and the more negative experiences they have from not acting on it, the more ingrained the behavior will become.  And after a certain number of years, you have to accept that it's so ingrained that there may be very little choice left.    Add:  Ever wondered what happened to the "crack babies" of the 80's?  The term is no longer used because as they tracked the babies, it was shown that what made a bigger difference than the nature of their conception and background was the nurture they got afterwards.  The 'addiction' they were born with made no difference.  The quality of the home, the nuturing of the parents, these made more of a difference.  Look it up.  There's no more crack babies because we know better now.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Each of us is shaped by both our genetic code and our experiences.

In the study, they took mothers that smoked during pregnancy, and then tracked the children for problems with self control. Half the mothers were genetic mothers - the other half were surrogate mothers.     What they found was that the natural mothers that smoked had a higher number of children with self control issues, than the surrogates who also smoked. The "result" is that, if it was nurture, the smoking should have affected all children - but it only affected those that were genetically linked to the mother. So, must be NATURE...

And having studied the idea on my own for quite a while, I think it's a little bit nature and a lot nurture.    I mean, there's quite a few things we have in common with those of, say, Shakespeare's time, such as an obsession with fashion and an obsession with the famous and wealthy. So, stuff like that is obviously human nature.     On the other hand, a lot of the type of person we develop into is determined by nurture. For example, if I'd been raised in a wealthy family, I might desire the "finer things in life" a bit more, like champagne and diamonds and gold and silks and brand name clothes and such. If my parents had just given me all the spending money I could ask for, I probably would have no work ethic and instead believe that the world owes me a living (which it does NOT, nor does the world owe anybody else a living).     So really, a little nature, a lot of nurture.

zBqt99avaa	I don't know much about Paul.  What I was taught was that his name was originally Saul and he was blinded while on a donkey en route to Damascus.  He wrote a lot of letters.  You guys think he destroyed Christianity.  You may be right, but I haven't read up on it for myself.  If you have good resources (book name/author) anyone, please e-mail me.    As for Judas, there is more than one theory concerning him, from a Christian and historical (sort of) perspective.  He was one of the Apostles.  When Jesus entered Jerusalem during Passover, he betrayed him to the Romans for 30 pieces of silver.  Jesus was praying the garden of Gethsemane and Judas came with the Roman centurions, and kissed him on the cheek.  Popular dogma indicates that he subsequently committed suicide.    Another theory is that he did not betray Jesus.  Christians believe that it was Jesus' intention to die for us.  Therefore, he asked one of the Apostles to bring the Romans to take him off for crucifixion.  Judas was the Apostle in charge of the money.  At that time, whenever you entered a city, you had to pay a tax.  Judas was the person in charge of this.  Also, as they travelled around, it was Judas who would go ahead and make arrangements (food/shelter).  It is believed that Judas was the most trusted of all the Apostles, therefore Jesus asked him to get the Romans, since Jesus didn't believe any of the other Apostles could do it.    EDIT:  Judaism comes from the town of Judah where the Jews used to live...not from the name Judas...    EDIT:  Mandoos, you're refering to the Gospel of Barnabas.  This has been soundly refuted by a Muslim scholar as a complete fake.  It references so many things from the dark ages (knights, etc.) for which there was no connections to the time of Jesus.

Judas was the apostle most loved by Issa and who betrayed him, leading the Roman soldiers and Jewish high priests to him and identifying him by kissing him on the cheek. Issa was an outlaw in his society and some of the apostles and disciples resembled him in appearance and sometimes serves as decoys for Issa when the authorities would come and look for him. So the authorities needed someone to give positive identity on which one was Issa.    If I am understanding Islam version of the story, Judas actually led them to a different man who was willing to die in Issa's place? So everyone thought Issa was dead for three days? Did Issa lie about resurrection to the Christians? Was he instructed by Allah to carry out a ruse? I'm confused about this.    @Vegeta, Issa did know Judas was going to betray him. Read the parts about the Last Supper in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. He says he will be betrayed and he identifies by whom with indirect statements his apostles of the time would have understood (and that we can figure out today if you follow the clues in those passages and at the end of book of John).    However, that he knew that is not an argument that he is Allah or the literal son of Allah. Prophets know things, they are given knowledge of future events, that's part of being a prophet.    @Juvegirl, Paul did not destroy Christianity. He is not responsible for his books being in the New Testament nor for people following them.

Ask them to hold while you have a comedy argument in fake chinese with a friend.    Deliberately mis-hear the address over and over.    Have fun!|`|76cAAPfBaa	Simply tell them they have the wrong number, and promptly hang up.

Why would you even think to take the order and tell them it would be with them in half an hour? You'd just leave someone waiting? That's low, all they probably did was dial the wrong number!

Our phone number was one digit away from the Catholic priests home number, so we often got their calls.  "Hello. Is Father there?"  I would hand the phone to my "then" husband.  He would have the longest calls, trying to figure out who he was talking to. When he'd ask, "They'd say "It's Eugene', and talk on. By the time they got to baptizing the baby, he had it figured out.  I have talked to Cardinals and Bishops, and I'm not even Catholic.  He used to get so mad at me......I wonder if that's why he left.|`|DJLeObm4aa	Would just try and interrupt them and tell them they have got the wrong number.

Your looks appealed to him. He did not know what to say so he said the first thing that came to his mind.    Whether it is right or wrong - that is open to debate. But he approached you. Are you approachable? I do not see that as a bother.    No answer to his comment would have been just right.|`|AA10700334	you're probably bugged because nobody asked that guy for his opinion in the 1st place. He needed to mind his own business.

4770ec96b00c277a1052a824b2656201aa	Well, I agree that the original idea of manifest destiny had a religious component - that "God" had chosen the Puritans (and, later, the other people who came here) to spread out over the North American continent...and that same religious justification is, I believe, a subterranean impetus in the current imperialistic drive to rule the world.    Historically, the sense of divine election and the identification of the Americas with ancient Canaan were used to justify expelling America's Indigenous Peoples from their land. The colonists saw themselves as confronting "satanic forces" in the  Native Americans.     There has always been a strong sense of being "God's chosen people" in America's self-identification.  And, much like in the Old Testament, it is something that we cannot examine honestly...as a rationalization for conquest.    We don't seem to have learned much from history.|`|pNtnbwoAaa	No, history proves that mankind is SINFUL. If you think we are not, just open a history book.

Unfortunately, you, much like the terrorists, usually only have centuries old supposed "Christian" atrocities to fuel your weak arguments.|`|37ab3b548443ae93a5a0b514ffc24bcaaa	EVERY major religion in the world teaches peace. It is the radical groups in those religions that twist the words of their holy books (Torah, Bible, and Qur'an) and read only the passages of war and to kill, and believe in only those passages.    As-salaamu alaykum  -  Peace be upon you|`|yBoOqP2Xaa	No.  not so much Western religion.  But it has shown the bloodthirsty drive for the US to protect its children of the future from those who live to hurt them.
ulwXFrrJaa	Either that, or some sects just interpret the Holy Ghost differently.  It might be the same holy ghost, but due to man's inability to grasp a lot of theological concepts (heck, i don't fully  understand the trinity and i was catholic for 18 years) it might just get explained vastly different in different denominations.      Or maybe the Holy Spirit likes to inspire people in different ways to encourage dialogue, debate and critical thinking to combine ideas and form a new truth.  maybe once all of God's children learn how to relate ideas with one another without all the bickering, we'll find out what the holy spirit really is.  maybe we all have a piece of the puzzle but won't be able to know what we are looking at until we are able to join together to share ideas without some refusing to listen to other's ideas because their small puzzle piece must be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	What?|`|lh8Tn02Naa	No, it means that eastern and western Christians have a different way of constructing their model of the trinity - and it is only a model, after all, we cannot possibly understand the reality - and a different attitude to doctrinal development.  The Orthodox are right according to their lights in claiming that in the original form of the creed the Spirit proceeds from the Father, period; the Catholics equally right according to their lights in claiming that under the Spirit's guidance our understanding has moved on; so in the Catholic creed the spirit proceeds from the father "and the Son" [filioque, for those without the Latin].    But as others have said, this row is also about a political power struggle within the Church.  It's not just a matter of whose doctrine is more authentic.|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	Possibly, but it is still much more likely more likely that they just follow different men. Gods grace is broader than mans.      Sorry, about my previous irreverence, I think I found the point where humor becomes cruelty.|`|UR4mWefGaa	It's only Western/Eastern differing opinions of the same thing. They are both a laugh riot. Mumble in Latin, or mumble in Greek. Swing the censers back and forth, or side to side, who cares?|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Without looking up your fancy words I will go to the simple part and say that different denominations/sects believe in the same God and Holy Ghost, but differ in their theology regarding them and their nature.  The only exception to this is the Mormons which indeed believe in some different deity but clone the names of Jewish and Christian beliefs and names.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	No, it just means a different belief in the nature of the Holy Ghost and God.  It's really a piddling difference that only a religious scholar would even really understand.  If that were the only thing separating the Orthodox and Catholics, they would have been re-united long ago.|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	HUH?

12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	Do you mean going against the commandments for the sake of survival? I'm not a Christian, but I'd like to answer from a moral viewpoint, if I may.    I feel that in certain situations, not only is it OK, it's sometimes the only thing you *can* do.    Think back to Hurricane Katrina. A part of the United States had become a third-world country. People were without water, food, clothing, shoes, medications, diapers, formula ... The very basics of survival were snatched away and sorely lacking.    Those who looted in order to obtain necessities were doing what was necessary for their survival, and that of their families. While theft is always wrong, sometimes it is a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils. Steal ... or starve?     The same situation occurs when you awaken in the middle of the night to find an armed intruder  in your home. Do you submit? Or do you fight?     You do what you must to protect your family. Even if the perpetrator ends up dead (Thou shalt not kill) it's a killing done  out of necessity and self-defense.     Sometimes, life throws you a curve where you have to compromise your principles (or your Commandments) in order to carry on with life. The survival instinct is incredibly strong for a reason: we do what we must, when we must, to survive.      This answer will be plagued with thumbs-down, but you can't tell me that in a desperate situation, the majority will pray for deliverance rather than act on survival. Trust me. They'll steal, kill, and do whatever is necessary.|`|AA11008046	No, my friend - never in a thousand yeaars..  Sin is sin and the circumstance doesnt matter.  Imagine if the police stopped you while in the commission of a crime and you offered the excuse "I was in a bind sir. this is only once. my family is in crises mode".  He would laugh so hard he would need an assistant to do his paper work.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	some people said gods morals are absolute so NO|`|gNUQ0CDtaa	I like John K s answer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Nope. In fact, that's where the rubber meets the road.|`|AA10471892	Christians are dead to that law, and dead to sin.  They are not a party to that old covenant.

Such as David's men eating shewbread. Or getting a mule out of the ditch on the Sabbath.    The New Covenant has no ceremonial laws.|`|JREs9K0Gaa	I don't believe it's right.  You're suppose to turn to God in a crisis instead of turning to sin.|`|JkC7nj7laa	well disobeying in disobeying, if you are a Christian you wouldnt have to be afraid of dying, if thats the situation you were in, because then you would be able to go to heaven and meet Jesus!!!!!!!!!|`|KmnbjZIdaa	The rules of morality is only a guide for you to determine what is right or wrong, good or evil.  In specific situations you have to use your own conscience and act accordingly.  It will not be a sin even if you disobey a commandment when your conscience tell you it is right to do so.|`|6PaGQaqKaa	Nope, they are commandments for a reason. See in the movie traitor they talk about this. It is actually a muslim teaching that you may disobey only to save you're life. But in actuality it still isn't right. Just like at columbine (remember that school shooting) well on of the men asked her if she believed in God. And she said yes and he shot and killed her. What if she said no but her like was saved? Well that would have been blasphemy and that, I hear, is the one unforgivable sin. What if she said no and then been killed any ways? Then what? A sin is a sin is a sin. God will deliver. Period.
zXIhB8Ycaa	To tell them that God loves them?  How is that abuse?|`|d8XND5ngaa	IMO yes.|`|AA11008046	The Bible says: "..train up a child in the way he should go and he will not depart from it...(when he is old)..." parenthesis mine  Thus teaching a child Gods ways is not child abuse.  If you do not teach children God's way then you haven't done your duty as a parent.  Every child deserves the right to choose for themselves at the age of understanding.  How do they know how to choose if they have never hear the Godly lifestyle?|`|G9dZN8omaa	1)  As far as the charts go, I don't believe them.  My guess is the author only questioned church goers and convicted criminals, and not the average, everyday person.  I've had more experiences with Christian criminals then atheist criminals.  My Christian ex father in law was found guilty in a case of copy write infringement (he copied porn and sold it cheap).  My credit card was stolen out of my purse at a Christmas party by a Christian.  I don't know a single atheistswho has done jail time.    2) As far as the child abuse goes, it boils down to the individual family.  If the family teaches love, peace, and acceptance, then it doesn't hurt anything.  If they teach children to hate non-Christians, gays, and generally everyone but people like themselves, then I would have to classify it as child abuse.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	Please, did you even read the actual article or just copy the drivel from godandscience whole cloth.    How exactly did you read Dawkins article as miss this.     'What shall we tell the children?' is a superb polemic on how religions abuse the minds of children, by the distinguished psychologist Nicholas Humphrey. It was originally delivered as a lecture in aid of Amnesty International, and has now been reissued as a chapter of his book, The Mind Made Flesh, just published by Oxford University Press.     That is his scientific evidence.    The rest of your copy & paste efforts isn't worth my time.|`|vprXuK2Kaa	if brainwashing can be classified as mental/pshycological abuse|`|HHCjyEshaa	well it looks like you didn't read Dawkins book past that section.    He goes on to mention studies that show how areas with more religious believers have higher crime rates, drug abusers, etc and areas with more atheists display a decrease in these areas  Also there are numerous studies that show how the more educated and successful portion of society always is directly connected to the amount of atheists in that sector.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	My opinions are pretty close to Dawkin's opinions on this.  Religious indoctrination was the worst thing my parents ever did to me, even though I am sure they had the best of intentions for while doing it.  I'm sure I have made at least my share of mistakes raising my own children, but I didn't make that one.    --   Regards,    John Popelish

The pharisees etc had a problem, He could walk on water, raise the dead, heal the sick and feed the hungry. They couldn't. They didn't comprehend the possibility of the resurrection. Read Acts in the NT to see what happened and is still happening now. Jesus said to love and feed our enemies.

If people can't tolerate that you don't fall into line with their idea of it, so be it. If they want to get offended over that, that's on them and rather stupid if they do.

If you see in them a tendency toward something that would be against God's will, then it is your responsibility to lead them in the right way to go.    Attend a good Christian church and be sure your children are there with you. Be a good Christian yourself so your children will learn the right way from watching you and your actions hour by hour.    Keep your children away from these bad influences that are pulling them in the wrong direction. They are just children and are not mature enough to think for themselves. They need to learn right from wrong from you, not from some atheistic school teacher.     That is why they need you to continually guide their thoughts toward Jesus Christ and what He did for them that will allow them to join Him in heaven when their human bodies die.|`|ccZuEOEfaa	As long as you teach them to respect themselves and others, you don't really need to interfere in their religious beliefs.

I advise doing your best to help them learn about whichever faiths they're interested in.  However, also do your best to expose them to faiths other than what they feel pulled towards, so as to help them make an informed choice.|`|tq6fCjy1aa	That is something to celebrate and it should be acknowledged that they should find what they believe is in their heart. That is what will lead them to happiness in the end.  If you believe one faith is more correct than the others, then you can discuss "your" faith. And put your passion into your own faith, but treat all your children equally if they agree or don't agree with your faith.|`|pQ4L0BnIaa	if you're a religious person then you most likely have religious tolerance. so treat each child as a person and allow him or her to choose for them selves. as a child i was told to be a christian. and i believed blindly now i've changed my outlook on religion and gone away from it. honestly it's made me a better person. so let your children learn about them all and make their own choices.|`|2wBuWSFoaa	u might not know whats best for them  if they're happy with their erligion, then i dont think they would be too happy at you if u try to force them into another religion  if someone doesnt think their religion is right for them and that they dont agree with many of the preachings, then they'll change, but if not, dont "guide" them because you'll end up like all the other parents|`|BF896wpwaa	what you should do is let them follow their own beliefs and as a "good" parent just be there for them and support them. If you try and force your beliefs on them and are not supportive of their decisions then you will push them away. Just be there for them in the difficult time and don't criticize their beliefs. Also preach tolerance to hopefully avoid conflict between them. If they do get into fights with one another explain to them that everyone has their own beliefs and you shouldn't belittle someone for  what they believe in    -- best of luck|`|aaa422d316ca680542bb286a281814e5aa	Tell them what you believe in and try to teach them morals and integrity.

I think most ppl know that the religion of a land usually guides the life of most of the ppl so I would look over Hinduism and India, look at their living conditions. Islam and the middle east, there conditions, Atheism and Europe, there condition. And Christianity and the U.S.A. and our living condition. I would also look at the historical backing of a faith, was it just a random idea out of the mind of a philosopher or was it something that was backed by many historical and archeological events/findings. What faith leads to a life of most purity and living for something greater than self? When you do your research yourself I think you would find that Christianity is what blessed us with the great nation of the United States of America and that our living condition is 2nd to none only because of Jesus Christ and his mercy.... but when you come to your own conclusion then you have to face that whatever conclusion that is.. it is just that, and that there can not be 2 or 3 gods... they would not work together lol... And that is one thing that is tearing about acclaimed Christian Europe, their belief in Universalism rather than the truth that there is only one way to heaven, and they try to back it with scripture when the bible says that Jesus is The way, The Truth and The life, none get to the Father but through him. But I would suggest you do your homework and see what happens : ).|`|hSeAx5cCaa	First of all, please ignore "God's faithful disciple." God doesn't want us to love him/her (I think God transcends being male or female, but finding an appropriate pronoun is difficult)  or to follow Christian beliefs out of the fear of going to "hell". I wouldn't want someone to love me because I told them if they don't then I'm going to torture them for all eternity. Love is given willingly and with no strings attached.    Anyway, I'm Buddhist but my girls go to a Christian school and I just listen to them and ask them what they think when they talk about things they learned at school. It's important to let them find their own way. You can guide them by encouraging them to read from different spiritual texts and by telling them what different people believe and asking them what they think. You can tell them what you think too,  but I would also teach a healthy respect for the beliefs of others.|`|t88527U1aa	They will follow you no matter what be careful where you lead!|`|CSzDV3gEaa	it's important for them to be confident in their own beliefs and not be forced into another religion. do these children have different fathers or what? also how old are they?

Atheists can do the same too. Thoose people are annoying. I don't think that we should judge people by their religion. We should treat each other fairly regardless of religion.|`|npWGkuwnaa	We all have our own truth. Mine is right for me and your's for you.

"children who swear"    key word..children    as adults we learn not to generalize either|`|zLUk9YyCaa	It's hard to keep swear words away from them...other kids at school would be swearing and they'd finally know what the ''f-word'' was.|`|KmULmT7Baa	It's a fad I'm afraid, sad to say it's not just Christians.|`|2CBxqNcaaa	do they now.

czXaUPIlaa	When I'm tired, I get sleepy during meditation. This has happened for 20 years and will likely continue to happen. I've seen Zen masters nodding off during practice. It's normal.    When the mind gets sleepy, you can make an extra effort to stay awake - this is actually very good training because it strengthens your "center," thereby building stable energy.    Sometimes our mind gets "sleepy" when we ask it to do something new - like watching thoughts, feeling, and impulses come and go. This kind of "avoidance sleepiness" will probably pass fairly quickly, as the mind gets the idea that you're simply going to do this, no matter what.    Sometimes the sleepiness goes against our idea of what we might get from meditation - a clear, shining perception of the world around us, for example. In this case, the problem isn't with the sleepiness, but with having some idea of what we'll get from meditation. If you let go of any such idea, your practice will be just as it is.    As for back aches - these are normal, as are aches in the shoulders, knees, necks and other parts of the body. As long as you don't have the kind of pain that indicates that you're harming your body, you needn't worry about it. After a while, you will simply be able to observe the tension or discomfort without judging it - "Ah, here's the ache that always comes after 15 minutes!"    So, yes, you will get used to it. And you may occasionally feel sleepy. That's okay - it's normal. Everything that happens during formal meditation is normal. Our work is to settle into that.    Congratulations on your first experience. How wonderful!|`|zcwSIBHwaa	It is normal to feel sleepy. There are some kinds of meditation where you close your eyes too. Try to keep an eye on your posture as that is really essential.|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello Zal    All normal.     The tiredness will go as you gain experience. Make sure that you have good posture for staying awake as well as for ache and pains etc. Make sure your not tired before hand, nor eaten a large meal etc.    Sounds like your doing good!    Sadhara|`|AA12059478	The sleepy sensation you're experiencing is called dullness and is not condusive to good meditation practice.  Try focusing on an image or something and be mindful if your mind strays or if your energy becomes low.  The pain in your back is due to poor meditative posture. You need to talk to your teacher for assistance on how to correct your posture.  Hope this helps|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Sleepy means that you should try to do it at a different time, in the morning for example or during the day.    You don't have to keep your eyes open completely (depending on what form of meditation you do), in fact it's not recommended. Usually you either keep then semi-open and relax the eyelid muscles, or you close them completely (I do this).    Your back aches are because either you are not in good position, or maybe you need to put a cushion behind your back and not strain the muscles. Remember, the point is to relax. You may even wish to simply lay down or sit in a chair or couch.|`|6ZL6pKh2aa	Work on your posture, that's pretty key to meditation. You can also close your eyes if you like. The goal here is to clear your mind of all thoughts and just live right then in the present moment. I like keeping my eyes open though and just staring at the wall or something, it helps me "zone out" better.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Don't resist sleep... that happens to nearly everyone during meditation. It is just a sign that there is some extra rest needed. Take it.    Also, normalization can take place in any part of the body, so some temporary discomfort can come along as the situation is being corrected.    To put this another way.. you are doing fine.. just take it as it comes.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	For westerners who are not used to sitting in the lotus position it is often better to meditate using a chair with an upright back to support the back.    An aching back distracts from the meditation.    It is normal to feel sleepy when you first start using meditation.  It is best to meditate when you are feeling alert, like first thing in the morning, or early evening.    Bedtime is not a good time to meditate.
R6lxaKiEaa	With Sympathy|`|VMY7No0eaa	with my deepest sympathy.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	If it's a really close friend, you don't necessarily need a closing line in an email. You can give your condolences in the body of the email, and just stick your name at the bottom. Email is less formal than a written letter, especially between close friends.    You might want to respond over the phone, if she's upset. Maybe she wasn't very close to her father-in-law, but if she was, I'd suggest calling her a day or two after the funeral is over.|`|rUgC7SPsaa	My heart is with you,  (name)|`|rThIVk2maa	My thoughts are with you,   Namegoes Here    or something like that|`|ern87uWhaa	Warmest regards.    or Sorry about the death, if you need anything I am here for you.|`|zdu3gh8jaa	I offer my help for you to take as and when you need it at this difficult time,  Sending you/With love, comfort and support  Hugs  Name          Hope this helps.|`|pNagjehGaa	take care    -me
jcK6EXpiaa	Because we have allowed ourselves to become little sheep. The government has complete and total control over each and every single one of us. Think about social security numbers..they are the root of a lot of corruption. If a person refuses to allow themselves to be tagged like an animal, they have no rights whatsoever, even if they are born here.     Think your life is twisted in this insane country? I have to pay taxes to the government who considers me a "ward" (i'm native american) I have to help fund the military who can open fire on  my people at any time. If I commit a crime outside of my reservation, I will be prosecuted according to the local government. If a non-native commits a crime on a reservation, we cant do anything about it unless a county sheriff of a near-by county decides to help.|`|OZjlW5utaa	I get you but am gonna have to burst your bubble, lifes not like that. Thats why we get a better life here. If anyone could do these things then we would have dictators, crazy people running their mouths and themselves. It wouldn't work.    When you get a car you have to have insurace, what if you crash or someone crashes into you, no ones gonna protect you, only you, and no ones going to admit I done it'.    But we need a more relaxed system in our lives there be too many people on our backs ruling over us.|`|NDGnbB9qaa	Yes I would have to agree with you it would be nice to be able to buy and sell things without the hassle of getting permits or licenses.You speak of third world countries and all I can see is poor people with little hope or dreams of a better life ,because the people who are selling things without having to pay any fees are also getting very rich and not helping their own countrymen.So as nice as it might sound I guess I would rather continue with the system we now have as wrong as it might be.At least I don't have to worry about starving to death yet.|`|qvycijbOaa	Sounds similar to the UK. All westernised countries share these obstacles. When i was recently on holiday in St Kitts (Caribbean) the freedom was so overwelming. You can literally pick a bit of land you want to build your house on, and because there is no corporate tension or competition around to build your home, you can easily setup payment and the builders will begin within a week. Now the caribbean isn't third world, even so, the relaxed attitude is evident. It can get to me at times, you start reminiscing on normality, and sometimes  the lifestyle in general is just too slow. There is a good balance though. Far less stressful than westernised countries and more structured thant third world countries, so I cant complain too much.|`|ncdTxID9aa	I agree with Digga, do you want people to easily dictate you, like a cult?|`|iybezfi6aa	I agree.  Name ONE thing that the government doesn't control in some way. I bet you can't do it.
LQQAQDkIaa	I have a big problem with White Americans saying that Mexicans can't be here because there is a border. These people didn't cross the border, the border crossed them. If they get here and are criminals, deport them, if they get here to work and live better, then embrace them because they are no different than us. They are culturally closer to us than many of the immigrants and refugees we allow in. For a native to embrace Islam is no different than a native embracing Christianity. Both are foreign to us, and brought by outsiders. All the mainstream religions here in the US are imported. Pax Christi|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	What do you think they are trying to do... and not just in the UK|`|LEBV1FPuaa	Well, I think if the world is scared of Buy American they have just seen the beginning of the giant called angry unemployed Americans. We will make it a crime to not E-verify, ban the importation of finished, and pull are fighter wings out of Saudi Arabia and see how long OPEC lasts.
GZVTLPwuaa	I make heart pancakes for my son before school, I also get him a cute bear, a balloon and a small present(this year madagascar 2) to unwrap for "love" day as he calls it. Since it falls on a weekend this year consider doing something special with them? A trip to movies maybe?|`|39e42731815d54b9d4578239e245344faa	Get them a cute stuffed animal and i big Hershey kiss or something like that my. My mom always got me a stuffed animal i would love it and my dad would get me chocolates.

Besides, it's recommended as a kind of "Sadaka or Zakah= a grant for patient and for poor" to  thank God on you health .  it's obligatory in Islam to help others.  in Egypt, there is a big campaign for blood donation in the streets, universities, everywhere and the people donate for the patients.   Every thing related to the best of people is allowed in Islam.|`|AA10824205	Yes. My brother has donated blood. His lots of colleagues donated blood, and they still donate blood. He is studying in a medical college. There are regular compaigns there for blood donations!|`|nsbWaiW0aa	yes, because it helps people. you can donate anything as long as it doesn't change the way you look.|`|zgL6vMCiaa	ana ktir betmana etbara3 b damme etc...  its like a sadaka jariya..we die and stil ppl live with our own blood, eyes, hands, leggs etc... woww thats  beautiful to do  its a dream to me i should write to my parents to do it when i die....i hope i dont forget!!!    edit:  @julia: thank u..dont think that we are weak and we cant make u cry by some words but i wont hurt u...im just gonna be a good muslima ...so talk as much as u want ....e7ke ta techba3e.....believe me ur loosing and btw ur welcomed here..we are nice to everyone.....|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Yes of course it's allowed.
Rrz62ODcaa	My Mother always prays for God to put her where she is needed.  I was there when all this happened but my Mother can tell it better still I'll try to recall as much as I can.  All most 11 years ago my family was traveling by bus from Maine to California.  Well going through our nations most populated region we got a vibe from the people, something like the Whites and the Blacks won't associate with the other unless they need to.    At a bus terminal in one of these cities was a partly blind retired Seventh-day Adventist pastor and his wife who were waiting for transport.  When she was using the restroom, her husband (thinking she was by his side) boarded their bus with all their food and money and was soon out of town.      Our bus was soon called back to the terminal to pick-up a stranded traveler, the wife.  After she came aboard our bus Mother asked Father to go out and ask the bus line employees if they could open the cargo hold so he could get some food out of our case.  Dad was groggy and resisted so Mom would have backed down.  But the thought came into her mind "No!  The kids will need food in the morning and we may not have a rest stop then."(Leaving the populated sector)  So Mom bug Dad until he got up and did as she asked.        He came back on the bus with a bag of bread made from seven spouted grains, the name was Ezekiel 4:9.  In the morning the pastors wife came up behind Mom and asked "Are you by any chance Seventh-day Adventist."  Mom a little shocked by such a very accurate guess replied "Yes.  How did you know?"  (At that time the World had only ten million SDAs with a bit less then a million in the United States.)  The Women answered "By your bread.  Only an Adventist would have that kind of bread."  (Seventh-day Adventist are known for our health practices.  Other travelers were eating fast food.)    God made sure we would meet this woman so she would have something to eat that day well she was away from her husband with no money and no food.  My family is White and hers is Black and as she rejoined traveling with her husband and left us we naturally made good-bye hugs.  This made people wonder something like why are Blacks and Whites embracing each other.  People asked "Do you two know one another?"  (It is a bit much to ask strangers a question that personal in American culture so it must be from seeing a black and a White hug)  The answer was "Yeah, we are sisters."  (in Jesus)      btw I would like to be the only one around with a Maine accent again.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Yes but its very personal and I would rather not tell the story in public. But I will say the birth of my children where absolute miracles in every way conceivable :)|`|AYs6iFlLaa	When I was young, I prayed and asked God to heal my foot( I had  a sore there for months that wouldn't go away) and the next day it was gone.|`|Cugx9IXraa	YEAH!! one time, i wanted paper and it just fell from the sky!!!

Someone knocked on the door, I opened it like a fool (didn't have a peep hole then) and there was this guy standing there in blue jeans, a flannel shirt and a screwdriver in his hand. He asked to come in and check the air conditioner. Now I know for a fact we didn't request anybody to come do so. I had this over powering feeling like someone was telling me to close the door and locked it quickly. I said No you can't come in, he gave me a disgusting look, and I shut the door. Now, if he had been from a company he would of had some sort of identification (shirt, name tag, what not). He had nothing. There was no vehicle parked in the driveway either. The only thing I can think is that a guardian angel was there and that is a miracle to me.|`|rJLeVoMKaa	I am thankful your sister survived as God helped her and everyone that day.      My story occurred in 2003, when I drove through a 4-way intersection going straight- another driver took a left turn and failed to account for speed.  We impacted so hard that her SUV fell over and rolled one time and totaled my car.  The act of God was my life was spared because I did not wear seatbelt and should have gone right through the windshield, and the other driver walked away with only a bruise on their head.  I remember I lost consciousness for 30 seconds, and my body separated from the car long enough not to sustain physical harm.  The force of impact should have killed her or me or both of us.    The other story occurred in January 2004- when after nine months I finally found work.  I was terminated and had difficulty finding work in 2003.  The job I was given I held for almost five years.      I need another mieracle now as I am trying to find a full-time job.|`|j6OezBqgaa	Loved it thanks for shareing   how old is youa are sister now      @Asker   Ok Thanks 4 reply|`|hFxJ02NSaa	Yes, a number of small ones. Here's three...    Few years ago, finding the super glue at the bus stop the morning I needed to fix my daughter's shoe before taking her to daycare. Walking on the way, the shoe breaks, heel coming off, I said, I need super glue or something to fix this. There was unopened package at bus stop.    Another time our transfers ran out because an appointment went long, and I was down 13 cents to get her and me on the bus. I thought, I'll ask someone at the bus stop. When we got to bus stop, there was exactly 13 cents on the ground.    Another time I'm with agnostic friend, he knows I am very religious. Metal piece breaks from lawnmower, but examining it, the piece isn't broken, the place where it came off isn't broken, the nut and bolt are still in their place, there is no possible way this part could have come off. I show it to agnostic friend -- do you see this? Yes, he said. Is that possible? No, he said. It's not possible, right? No, he said, not possible. I don't think he's so agnostic anymore.|`|1oOj7KLbaa	Shias killed
wTqid2ONaa	The earliest was probably pagans or whatever it's called when you worship nature.    I think organized religion was invented as a way to control people and sedate them, if you look at all the major religions they all preach the same thing, they just wear different hats ( literally ) lol.    I don't have any problems with people being religious, i'm a practicing muslim, i have a big problem with organized religion's mob mentality though ( pope, dumbass sunni/shiite clerics, televangelists ).|`|3cLA6wCWaa	I think it was dravadianism or something like that. 5000 bc or so    good question    Edit:  I think religions were created to answer the unknowns of the times. You have to remember that most people were not educated and most sciences were almost nil when organized religons were created. And those same sciences have since grown leaps and bounds while religion has stayed the same as it was when created.|`|3r252UIRaa	Religion is man's search for the ultimate truth and happiness. We know that there's a higher truth and happiness, but we just don't know how to get there. Certain religions can help us to achieve this higher state of eternal bliss and peace.
12cf5703a9000539447fcc81882d4bf0aa	In my school I've noticed that presenting things in the form of some sort of song or rap goes over well, and if its a group project then you could make up some sort of creative skit to present it (if its not a group project, ask your teacher if you could just use other people to say some lines, but that you would be saying the majorly important stuff) If you decide to do either of these, make sure you print out a copy of the lyrics/script to give to your teacher along with the report.|`|2cc738b44ef81ed43b3da33914c5c811aa	You need to write about something that interests you personally.

They make communications so easy that being deaf seems quite natural and I was not put into any embarrassing situations.  If I didn't understand the first time, they would resort to something else till I finally understood.  It was so normal for them they would not even show the least bit outrage that I was not able to grasp the meaning.  That by itself would need to be a practiced thing for me.

Some deaf are totally deaf, some hear w/a hearing aid, some use a cochlear implant. Some have completely normal speech like that of a hearing person & others have a 'flat' sound to their voice.

But I have to admit it is funny to see you guys argue with your hands, it's very animated and way better than arguments with words.
ZCh0OHuhaa	Clifford, this is the funniest question I have ever read.    No, I didn't but I wish I would have had a playmate with your mind way back then.|`|juWJ47hXaa	No, because even as a child, I knew that death arrives too fast in real time, so why waste time playing it?|`|g0gMQUCVaa	*roflmao*  No..can't say we did.    We played "Stewardess".  My mom worked for the airlines and we had the wings, used tickets and everything.  I used to put one of mom's wigs on my head, some of those Leggs eggs in my shirt for boobs and I was off!    Coffee, Tea or me...|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Wow, we played lots of store, school, re-enacting tv commercials...but never funeral. I'm surprised we never thought of that one. Going to the funeral home was virtually a weekly event & very much of a social thing for one side of my family, lol.    I went to my 1st funeral at age 3...& they kept coming (or rather...going).    lmao at NanaT: I had a l'eggs chest, too!|`|xWqKKp0Naa	lol. nope , but lots of playing house , if you get my drift .           D :)|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	No, but unfortunately  I did play Dr. please don't tell my Mom.|`|MJdUkar5aa	Oh yes. Buried dead birds, cats etc. Then dug them up again a few weeks later to see if the corpse had gone to heaven etc. And nope, they hadn't.|`|AA11749193	Does the time my Cousins and I bury a tom cat in mom's flower garden (The casket was one of mom's shoe boxes- guess she'd taken a liking to it, because, she was pissed when she saw what we'd done-or maybe it was all the dug up holes in her flowers- we used them as the floral arrangements, you see)....Other than that, I invested much of my childhood life/death games into that boardgame "Operation"you know - when the patient's nose lit up red if you screwed up....Boy, did that a LOT when it was my turn!|`|wy54YPuQaa	I did not because I never even attended a funeral until I was 23 years old.|`|b138671ae3255ea398ff2f873fbf25e8aa	Yes...my mom said I was such a treasure...lets bury her!|`|SDHmVDlNaa	Oh yeah.  My sister and little brother and I would do this and put flowers on each other and cry and say stuff over each other.   I also used to pretend to do in my barbie dolls by execution, usually hanging.  My mother was sure we would grow up to be a serial killers or something.   We didn't though.  LOL  I love my cats and my kids and I even love my husband most of the time.        On a more serious note, there may be a reason we did it though.  I grew up with the Vietnam war on the news every night.  They used to announce how many died and how many Vietcong were killed each day.  The car accidents were shown in bloody details on the news and my parents talked about World War Two *My dad's company was at the battle of the bulge,  but he never got to go because he was sent to the hospital with asthma. His company was shipped out and all lost.  He was the only one who survived.  It made a big impression on me as a child.  My dad was a doctor who worked the emergency shift on the weekends and would come home sometimes in tears after being called in for a car accident where all were beyond hope or because some back alley abortion shop had botched an abortion and had not only killed the baby but nearly killed the mother too.  We lived in a small town and you heard everything. If someone died everyone including the children were aware and often attended the funerals.  I don't know? There was a lot of death and images of death when I was growing up. Some how it seems sort of normal that we pretended about death.|`|TltaFfIZaa	no|`|rMP9BCyGaa	I  played a lot of games as a child but don't recall ever playing 'funeral'. Might have played cowboys and indians where we got shot and were 'dead' or nurses and doctors where someone would do a 'your dead' part but we never got as far as the actual funeral.    Death wasn't something that was spoken about when I was a child, not to me, even when beloved pets passed away and we buried them in the garden complete with a little ceremony it still didn't register with me that it was final.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	No, I can't say that it ever crossed my mind.|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	Did not have to, people in the family kept dying, got too much of it in reality.|`|jjt2enntaa	Just once.  It upset my mother so much we decided it probably wasn't such a good game.|`|UllYFJgjaa	We played something close to that I would say......one of my friends would be Jackie Kennedy and I would be Caroline Kennedy and we would get into my mothers slips (black ones) and her black pump heels and pretend we were at John F. Kennedy's funeral. It may sound weird but that was all happening at that time and I believe it was a way to help us kids get through the pain and grief.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	I attended too many funerals as a child, it never was something to play at, But I did gave a funeral for our kitty that got hit by a car. but believe me it wasn't playing.|`|FGCjgc8Raa	Does stomping on frogs and burying them in the sand count.|`|aXYiOskmaa	gee, that's one game i never played. i can't imagine why.|`|0mhcCyE5aa	One day when my daughter was 5 years old she was walking in and out of the house taking a different doll or stuffed animal with her each time.    I looked outside and she has them all lined up on the patio in chairs.    I asked her what she was doing and she said, "I am playing funeral!"|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	That's something I never played or even thought of playing. I played the normal happy, fun, things that kids all play.     Hide & Seek  Jumprope  Tag  School  Nurse  Jacks  Pick Up Sticks  Hopscotch  Board games  Card games  Mother May I  Dress up (my friends & I dressed up in our mom's old dresses, hats, gloves, jewelry, & heels)     etc.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	My four brothers and I attended my Fathers funeral when I was 8.  I never had any urge to play at what I saw there that day. My Mother crying and my brothers trying to act brave.  I will never forget the sound of the military salute at the cemetery either.|`|MH8cR5bhaa	No, but sort of.  We played Dracula and used a big box for our coffin|`|Hzf3QK9faa	When I was a lil'un we had full out dramas all day with the neighbour kids. The older girls directed the action and plot. Only played funeral with a foster child. We read kids  books about it and she moved on.|`|9g8spRvPaa	Yes we did and cowboys and Indians etc.  It was fun to play store, my mother would save all of the old food packages so we could make our own store and have supplies.  We just turned over some old boxes in the garage for store shelves and had a great time.One of us would get to play cashier and the others would be shoppers.
3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Jesus prophesied the amount of time before His resurrection.   When He told the Pharisees, "destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days", He was speaking of Himself.  They misunderstood (as they did often), and thought He was speaking of the physical temple.    No, when a believer in Christ dies, they go immediately into God's presence (to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord).  And, as someone else said, at the rapture of the church, it will be instantaneous; it will happen in the twinkling of an eye.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	Everything He did was to fulfill a prior prophecy.  Being in the grave three days was a the sign of Jonah who was three days and nights in a great fish.  Thanks for asking.|`|mMPjXbvcaa	His story was just a carbon copy of earlier gods, including the resurrection. I still have no idea why Christianity is so popular - you'd think adherents to a particular ideology would actually research what they believe.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Please read I Peter 3:18-20.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	It's actually three days.|`|4999d7adc142f277d9650c9fcdbb39cdaa	It's considered three days because Jews of that time counted any part of the day as a full day. So it was part of Friday, all of Saturday, and Sunday morning which is three days.    The three days is considered to have symbolic reasons. Examples being Jonah in a fish for three days, the Trinity, etc.|`|evlAYj8naa	Harry Potter don't use the magic wand to fly  he need the broomstick.|`|jURQWV6Paa	On the third day he rose again. When we go up in the Rapture it will be in a blink of an eye.
mXfLIk3Aaa	It's just a stereotype. I love rainy days. As for Mondays, it is usually the day you have to snap back into your "biological clock", as it was probably screwed up by sleeping in on the weekends, and on Mondays you have to wake up earlier.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Karen Carpenter started that myth.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	i dont know about you but mondays are "manic"   and tuesdays are depression.   rainy days are lacking in sunshine which also implies vitamin "D"   but you need vitamin E and C and A to go with D    Sundays at church could be filled with manic episodes that result in depressing mondays. it all depends on the types of poison your church uses, when the fill the air with polution and drugs     if you dont go to church you still have to have a wife that practices some form of sorceries. in order to be happy you have to rely on their genesarian practices.  poison the husband at the beginnin gof the day, if he doesnt come back he is forced to suffer withdrawls.|`|AsyB1qLyaa	I miss the Carpenters|`|jOwH96wKaa	No, since I live in SoCal I welcome the rain.    But yeah, I do hate Mondays. It always means it's time to go back to school. =(|`|QDFj9JPfaa	..."Monday, Monday....can't trust that day"....|`|bXeHr69Vaa	in the car business it's a well known story , never buy a car that was made on a monday or a friday. it seems the minds of the workers are elsewhere
uxfacsgmaa	Men, probably - they have to win over all the protective daddies first. But I guess it works the same way for women having to prove themselves 'worthy' for all the mothers out there as well.    So, I actually don't know :P.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	women :)    Females are competitive!|`|88adf0621d46a4d78324d57cbb47b1ceaa	women
DZCFD0p2aa	Don't say anything. Just re-wrap it and give it to back your neighbour next christmas. See how she reacts...it'll be hilarious.|`|848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	No. Of course don't mention it to either friend.   This is proof that regifting should only be done with totally different circles of friends.|`|GZtdISjNaa	LOL give it back to her and ask if she lost it! XD|`|76nTvO4iaa	Thank the friend who gave it to you and don't say anything else.    Then, at the next gift giving opportunity, re-gift it (again) to the person you originally gave it to without comment.
h1HyWqqeaa	maybe he just doesnt trust women|`|FKxrJxbPaa	You gotta look at outside circumstances,    I personally am as straight as they come, but due to financial circumstances i ended up going to a school that is 60% females and 20% gay males.....so my circle of male friends is VERY small there. Most of my guy friends dont go to school with me, so I spend a great deal of time around women and my 3 dudes that go to school with me.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I know a guy just like that. And if its not bad enough that he used to hang out with girls all the time, but he also loves shopping, clothes, doing his hair and dancing.    So my answer to your question is I would think the guy was gay, very gay..    Guys should at least have some male friends....Its only normal..|`|FKN9kBvLaa	I admit, my initial thought would be he's gay or bi, but I know there are just some straight guys like that, and the ones who ARE straight usually get A LOT of @ss.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	A) pillow biter     B) rump raiser      EDIT: lol Honestly, I'd rather kick it with females more than dudes. Guys are always frontin' to each other, beatin on their chests...women are more open and honest with things (unless you're in a relationship with them :-S)|`|wTqid2ONaa	I would want more friends like him lol.|`|RTaimrg7aa	Lucky    MAybe he just grew up around women like me.  2 sisters and a mom, Dad worked a lot to keep us in clothes.|`|14f43f349bb66eb9fca9c31edef61771aa	I might think he's gay. but I don't know maybe he's in tune with female side. But I think it looks suspect.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Yeah...I have to be honest...I usually generalize and assume that they are gay, unless I see that they are "with" one of the girls they are hanging around.|`|QgzTdZ2uaa	I don't necessarily think they're gay but I think they feel more comfortable with females, that they don't particularly like being in a group of men where you can smell the testosterone and the conversation is often about women's body parts and football.|`|46fouwFfaa	I think that they're easier to be friends with. Guys who do not have many female friends often misinterpret your actions, expressions, or words and will often take them as indication of your interest in them. It's very frustrating and things can get awkward fast. Whereas guys with many female friends do not have this mentality (although they can occasionally think this way).    That's why all my guy friends have many female friends. They just understand us better. :)
IFs6MWDJaa	I do not hate the word Normal  But i do not like the "idea" of what normal should mean|`|FpMS47sXaa	yes, I do.    the concept of normality is all subjective, yet too many people use it without a complete understanding of it.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Nope, not at all. Primarily because it is an ordinary word.    I consider myself normal, and I consider a lot of my friends (gay, bi, straight, and from all walks of life) normal. All of us have our own touch of insanity, of course, but that makes life interesting.|`|ODORT37Paa	In today's world, there is no such thing as normal.|`|Km6URXDFaa	yes i do what is "normal" these days and who thinks they av the right 2 tell ppl. i hate that word :(|`|syIp6d2Naa	Your batting a thousand there, besides who wants to be "normal". I think if we were all normal we'd be pretty boring and who's normalcy are you judging me by. What is normal for you might not be for me. I told my doctor the same thing. I've lived with this body a long time and if I come to you and say this is going on, I am there because it is not normal for me. When doing tests remember to judge them by what is normal to my body. I run a low  body temperature 97.4, so if my temp is 98.6 I am running a fever.  Besides I rather like being refered to that strange lady that lives on the corner by the kids. Keeps them off my grass too. :-)|`|xJ4D7BLGaa	I hate it when it is used to to describe a person as normal  nobody in this world can be described in the class as normal everyone is unique and different|`|xsuHDhIzaa	normal isnt as great as society thinks it. its used to have like a prefect putlook on things and how people should be and when people find something that is intimidating or overwheleming or they dont understand they automatically say its not normal coz they cant explain it.    normal is just too.....normal. uniqueness is soooo much better    =]|`|cIvFOzoiaa	I don't hate it, but I don't think it really applies to anything.|`|kZdyPspmaa	Not really.  Normal is what's right for each person, it's totally subjective.      I only have a problem when normal is used as a measure/standard.    For example: color TV, black & white TV, cable TV, dish TV, and "rabbit ear" TV each is normal because they are all TV.  The problem arises when normal TV is defined only as color TV, then all the others become abnormal or don't measure up or are below standard.    To be accurate the only issue is TV - that is normal and all the rest is merely a facet of what being a TV is and these facets are neither right or wrong, good or bad, they just are.    Sorry for my poor example, it's late :)|`|2Iwh9BDQaa	i guess i do.. in a way.. but all i know is im far from it :D|`|tJ0WNq9eaa	I don't hate it, but I don't think it applies when talking about people.|`|l7pMJfCTaa	yes cause normal is no fun :)|`|lg6qIQAOaa	yes there's no such thing as normal|`|lL5lKNIiaa	I do not hate the word normal. for me I would love to have my blood type Normal, not cycled. I would love to have ny rotatorcuff normal, not frayed. I would love to have my labrum in my shoulder normal and not torn. I would love for some aspects of me to be normal|`|AVxYA6Heaa	Yes, "normal" to me means you fit into a box, I hate boxes|`|9MRSjkkxaa	yes mam!|`|ilvzYmQqaa	i guess i do.|`|ZXFnlIAEaa	Oh yes, that word gets to me.  "Gavin, you're not normal! Transsexuals will NEVER be like us!"    Yes, true quote someone told me. But I turn up some bob dylan or the beatles and say F___ It. Let them tell you you're not normal or to be normal, they just haven't figured out what they want for themselves yet.  It's all good =]|`|Y9qTbFFraa	Well i don't hate the word   i just think being normal is so over rated|`|vJqPsEsWaa	Yes because it allows others to judge whether something you are or do isn't right.|`|N73oZyY8aa	I think it is over used but I don't hate it with a passion.|`|KszocgnSaa	Not really its just another word used to stereotype.|`|ig6qg2R4aa	No, I hate when people say "just be normal" when they're talking about my sexuality, and saying that being a lesbian makes me somehow "different" or unnatural or something. But to tell the truth, I also hate people who say "I'm not normal" and stuff like that, and they say they're so crazy and weird and insane, etc. Just because you like to have fun and you think you're crazy and weird and insane, it doesn't mean you're NOT NORMAL! People who aren't normal are the people in insane asylums, okay? ? ? Do the whole world a favor if you really think you're that far from normal and check yourself into one.
jWMXi3Lnaa	No stuffed animals. Get him something practical that he could use often.    Depending on what your budget is, you can get him anything from a video game to a car stereo|`|RKtHyOl6aa	At 17, if he drives then a key chain-not a funny saying one but one that every time he uses his keys he thinks of you.  This along with a few simple little love notes hidden for him to find is a great idea.      Another idea is burn him a cd some special songs that mean something to the both of you, take him to a special spot and sit back and listen to a few songs and take in the moment.|`|jUjydHRVaa	If he normally pays for movies, how sweet of you to buy the tickets this time.   Its nice to try to long lasting things, but on Valentines day its the thought that counts more than anything.    You could wrap them up with some candies, or you make heart shaped cookies etc. so that he has a 'present' type thing to open..    Enjoy
AA11244754	Just support them and let them know that you're there for them if they DO ever feel like talking.  I have had major personal problems too and I know what it is like not to want to be around anybody.  THANK GOD I HAD GOOD, LOVING, CARING & UNDERSTANDING friends around me that gave me space when i needed it and were there when I needed them to be.|`|c474dbd0961916458c1e501aee18ff38aa	please ask her whats wrong. those could be signs of depression|`|a9059da34713cf1fa2b13f04a97e06c1aa	It would probably be a very good idea to ask her what's going on. There's a lot of really bad stuff that can make that happen and she may really need a good friend to help her out right now.|`|bfa567dd14d32da7ceb175cdc0f6f633aa	maybe your friend is upset about something?! let me give you an exaple just to understand that this is normal!! a few weeks ago i told the girl i liked that i love her and she refused to understant and i was down for a very long time a friend of mine tryed to talk to me but i couldn't let her go let it go.... i got over it but i still think about her and every time i do that i get upset i don't waan talk to anybody and it takes time to get over something that important!!       why don't you stay more with her? if she feels like talking talk to her cuz if she sees that u don't wanna talk to her she probably won't do this again, that's talking to u about her problems!!! she must be going through a ruff period and u just have to wait!! it's normal to be like this!!       be patience and try to help her!!|`|5ea327fbd2f0ab76cb3c809201b27927aa	what i would do is ask them whats wrong and if they want to talk about it, if they say they don't wanna talk about it then just say that you there for them if they ever do.|`|35ac6f7405b93b09dd4d5ac7b59ee1ebaa	She could really be going through something personal right now, dont leave her in a time of need, she might not be ready to talk about what shes going through (if shes going through anything).. just let her know that you are there by being there.|`|AA10819547	You talk to them, you offer your support or a listening ear and then you let them decide whether or not they want to talk to you about it.|`|d13e3dcc989f81486c1daf3389c49d1baa	if you really care, ask her whats wrong.
SJLgRqgSaa	sometimes people think it is gay, beacuse in actual fact alot of gay men do it, however alot of straight men do it but just dont admit it!    gay people are more open  straight are not!    so it aint gay!! xx|`|NWopkX4baa	It's not gay. Everyone should take care of their appearance, if they like to shave or trim or not, good for them.|`|2uUctFHEaa	yes because personal hygiene determines your orientation  *sarcasm*|`|IFs6MWDJaa	How would anyone else but you and your bf or gf know that you even do that ?|`|GVw4WKaQaa	Trimming body hair makes me happy yes.  wait, sexual orientation? what kind of stupid question is that?|`|1UtVRoFHaa	People are gay. Not shaving!|`|sOeDTrPeaa	Not at all.|`|JjYXy2oqaa	It's not, it's considered masculine to have body hair, so obviously with the flamboyant and feminine image most people know it's assumed to be gay.     I know a guy who's straight and married and shaves his body hair, some guys like it some guys don't.    And no it does NOT determine sexual orientation!. :)|`|TTfTTlcCaa	It's not, and it doesn't.      Being attracted to, and having sex with only your same gender, make you gay.|`|InsBAcktaa	I does not...   It is however considered a feminine behavior.  Being femme and being gay are not the same and do not even correlate.  Metrosexuals are straight or gay and overprimp/trim/aesthetise/grrom.  Transgender folks shave and trim as well, most are straight.    Its just a stereotype and not really any truth to it at all.   Lots of atheletes and actors shave and trim as well.|`|MmIYDoGkaa	It isn't gay.Do you think I'm gay because I shave my arm every once in a while?No.People need to keep up their appearences, and I happen to shave to do that.NOPE IT'S NOT GAY.Hope I helped :D|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	It's not gay.

GqEqFSdpaa	I'm not a Scientoligist. But know more about the tech then I ever wanted to learn. Every thing I'm writting is true and what happened to me at one of there rehabs called NARCONON.    Scientology has nothing to do with Religion or Science. It is a Scam and a Cult!    It is a bunch of twisted facts and some bull crap tech on how man should live his life. Their idea of Ethics is nothing as you and I would want to follow.    They believe that any problem you have from a bad marriage to drug addiction can be cured by their tech. This includes getting a better job and coming out of a deep depression. They claim to fix it by using the same tech on everyone.    Here is a one of their dangerous beliefs:    They believe that "All illnesses to a greater or lesser degree and all fowl ups stem directly and only from what they call a PTS (Potential Trouble Source) condition." To be PTS means you are being supressed by an SP. An SP (Supressive Person). 1)So if you get sick they believe that it is caused by an SP, find out who the SP is and dissconect from that person and you will not be ill. You will not need a doctor or meds.2) Let say you work for them. You are driving one of their cars. You back up and hit something like a pole that was out of your veiwing range. This fowl up has been caused because you are PTS.Not because you just couldn't see it. Now you are put in one of their conditions. This would probably be The Condition of Treason. Treason definition: Betrayal after trust. They trusted you to drive the car and not hit a pole. You are now going to be put on an ethics cycle and relearn what you already paid for them to teach you. Manual labor and humilation. That's only part of the proccess to get back into their good graces.      Then the higher levels are right out of there founding fathers (LR Hubbard) Sci FI books. In order to learn that stuff you must pay lot of money to go through the classes to tell you this crazy secret.    Never take one of there personality test. That is how they tell you what is wrong in your life. A 200 question personality test that everyone takes. Same test for every problem. It is a money making scam that will turn you into a penniless cult member    I was scamed into one of their drug rehabs(NARCONON). They took   $ 30,000 from me and my family. They told me my family disowned me and I tried to killmy self three months later. My family loves me now and always have. Stay away from these people|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	My religion wasn't founded by a second-rate science fiction author who liked to dress up in clothing inspired by naval uniforms.|`|Z4VTYyXgaa	because Tom Cruise is a clown|`|BZMPax7Naa	That's what I try to tell religious people.

On the other hand, I just couldn't take a Scientologist seriously for even a minute.   That religion makes NO sense, was made up by a not-so-great scif-fi writer, and is just plain looney.     Sorry, but that's how I see it.|`|yvDzvIbBaa	Its called hypocrisy. actually, there is a difference between believing in Xenu than there is in believing in Jesus. one of these ideas is slightly more credible than the other.    I'm actually an atheist, but if I was to convert to a religion... I think I'd be going with the one that has some space ships and cloning in it.    at least Scientology does not put humanity in some ''glorious status'' of being the only life in the universe.|`|Rq1AjXWKaa	Part of the problem is that Scientology hides what it believes. Not many other groups do that...|`|qkCFLgaSaa	maybe because tom makes you all look like idiots and lil kids arnt trained to stare you down to look at your soul i swear that lil effer was a hardcore Scientology kid|`|yX4xVukPaa	Because, in general their religions don't insist on any of the following:  1. Psychiatry is responsible for 9/11  2. Any criticism of the religion is made by people who are (a) criminals (b) neo-nazis or (c) are paid to say it by drugs companies  3. It's ok to harass, lie to, defame and sue anyone who disagrees with the religion.    And none of their religions has done any of this:  1. Infiltrated the US government and been caught stealing files.  2. Compiled lists of it's enemies in the countries where it operates.  3. Stated that its aim is to destroy the profession and practice of psychiatry and supplant it.    Scientology has, and scientology does. Seems crazy enough to me.    With regard to the weird doctrine one very good reason for seeing it as weirder than the bible is that we *known* LRH wrote it, we *know* he was a fairly prolific liar and fantasist and we *know* he wrote science fiction stories.     For a similar amount of disbelief about Christian doctrine we'd have to know that all of it was written by a single highly unreliable source who made rather a lot of money out of it and also had a thing for zombies.|`|AA10985325	This is just general  religion bashing.  2 for the price of one!

a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	Almost. As you demonstrate, by not asking a question, religion is about being immoral, then invoking a fictitious father figure who forgives you.

Though there may be some atheists who believe what you state, I've never seen that sentiment in this forum.    The root of religion is:   To fabricate reasons for natural processes which they do not understand.   To control the behavior of others.   To accumulate vast, tax-free wealth fleeced from the gullible masses.   To wield power derived through extortion based on fear.|`|0hdo4WORaa	Freud put forward that theory, but that doesn't make it gospel.

Some people have less than acceptable childhoods in which their father's presence is nil. To make up for this, they substitute God for their father.

Leviticus 27:3-6  Set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel; and if it is a female, set her value at thirty shekels. If it is a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male at twenty shekels and of a female at ten shekels. If it is a person between one month and five years, set the value of a male at five shekels of silver and that of a female at three shekels of silver.    I also didn't understand why God considers it a sin to give birth, and even more of a sin to give birth to a daughter.  Leviticus 12:2-6  A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her monthly period Then the woman must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until the days of her purification are over. If she gives birth to a daughter, for two weeks the woman will be unclean, as during her period. Then she must wait sixty-six days to be purified from her bleeding. When the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering.|`|ki8kdpJPaa	You are using God as a crutch, THAT'S the problem.|`|a7282602981644d2fff09b1a41ac653faa	I never heard that, but if you look at it in a wider sence, I think it's more about the world and life in general making any sence to somebody. Everything doesn't make sence. you have to accept it for what it is. there isn't an explanation for everything.|`|4EcUngD2aa	It is called "transference." Atheists say that the desire for a "father figure" is at the root of religion because hidden within them is the secret desire for a father figure. They "transfer" their own unspoken desire to others, and are then left in a quandary. They certainly cannot admit their suppressed desire for a "father figure" -- their only recourse to ease the inner turmoil is to proclaim that such a Person as God does not exist.

If the child had absolutely no idea of the faith or never was told about the Gospel, we would try our best to teach them of the Good News.    If we adopted a child at his or her full grown age (a teenager) and have rejected the faith, we would try to love them and try to heal the wounds they have suffered in their childhood.|`|HIskrREJaa	im an atheist, but i'm answering anyway...  if i adopted a child (assuming not a baby) that followed any religion, then i would participate and encourage them as much as i could to keep their family/cultural traditions alive for as long as they wished.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	i was more or less a non christian bornagain fundie when i first backslid. but wanting to know which church to join i prayed and fasted for it and made my own covenant. !!! when i was invited into the home of my  uncle, i was told i must go to church, stop smoking and i had to work afterschool as a volunteer in the bishops storehouse.     i agreed. i was baptized within 3 months. i think.     again, i immediately became inactive. when i moved back into my mothers home, but when i helped my aunt move her stuff, i had faith enough to move out and live in my car. a person from church helped me get my first apartment and a job. so i was active for at least 15 years.     another family welcomed me into their home shortly thereafter. They did not force me to go to church, but i did go freely and faithfully    if a child came to live with me I would insist on going to OUR church by reason of the GOOD Positive outcome i had. however, if a child is positively of a different culture or of a different faith i would insist he go to a good church.   if i found out the child was satanic or luciferian i might seek to get him emancipated. and kick him out of the house. the worst enemies of a household are those that are satan worshippers, in my opinion, and by any other name, they are the worst kind of destruction on the family|`|89MKzLl3aa	The child would be converted to my faith end of discussion.

If she could find a ride to another church or activity that we were not attending, she most certainly could go.    What we would NOT do, under any circumstances with biological or adopted children is allow them to tell us how our home woud be run and managed.    The who point of adopting is to make a family, not make a free taxi service to do human desires and wishes.  If yu want the latter as a child or adult for children, become a foster parent, then you would be compelled to cater to the child, rather than make the child a part of your life.|`|KCucX9JPaa	When you adopt a child, religion should not matter.

He or she would have the same expectations that I have of my own children. I would train the child in the faith that I am, as is my right as a parent. When the child reaches the age where he or she is old enough to choose for themselves, I would still hope they follow my religious instructions. If they choose another path, this would not alter the fact that this is still my child. Entitled to the same love and recognition as a child of mine. However, it would make me very sad. But I love my children no matter what they do, even if I do not agree with their choices!|`|5ac5b76d7f8ed84c1048c43e47d56ae5aa	Why ask this question? You have your own idea of what "Xtians" are and what you think they do.    Do you know what most atheist/agnostics do, if they adopted Christian orphans?       Atheist families don't exactly allow their own biological children to SERIOUSLY CONSIDER Christ.  (Unless it's to bash supposed Xtians...)          Christianity is not a conversion. Christians are born to Christ forever.     Non-Christians haven't any interest in Christ at all.    Christianity is NOT a CONVERSION.

When i look at a woman who i think is hot, i feel things (lol) but i doubt you do. Its fine to appreciate great beauty in someone of the same sex, it doesn't mean that your gay or bi.   A good example is when you see a hot guy does it feel the same to you as when you see a hot woman?

Radar + gay = Gaydar|`|SC91Uwrhaa	sure you can.. Gaydar is when you can tell someone is gay!|`|PeQ40WcWaa	I think you can absolutely think a woman is hot, but be straight. If a person is straight, they are likely to think "she is gorgeous" or "she is gorgeous, I wish I looked like her / I like her jeans"...    But if you look at the woman and think she's hot in the sense that you are *attracted* to her, then you aren't entirely straight!    As for gaydar..... gaydar is the ability to seek out other gay people by sensing that they are gay (i.e. a gay radar). So it's guessing quite confidently that someone is gay - based on say, their clothes, mannerisms, the way they look at you, the way they talk, etc.    I'm also watching s.6 on You Tube.... and counting the days until Sunday when ep4 is on!    xx Sparklepop

AA10819547	I would suggest it is fundamental insofar as we are tribal in nature and "need" to disassociate our tribe from others.  Mods and Rockers, Punks and Skinheads,...    The point of it may be to "justify" one's tribe in order to promote a "feelgood factor" about belonging.    I wonder how intelligent we really are, though?  We behave (societally) as teenagers and, generally, strive for self (both individual and tribal) gain.  Some blame Reaganomics & Thatcherism for extolling the Free Market Economy and (its bastard child) Globalisation.      I have no such delusion.  Why blame an abstract when we promulgate it?    But then, I still have that Gene Roddenberry dream: that we should one day celebrate our differences and work together to a common aim. |`|09ae3ef600f8eed80097010bd6238febaa	Its a natural function for individuals or groups to behave in such fashion where insecurity has develop and one needs leverage.

Only the most inferior can be pushed down by another. Being better than another is only a state of mind, because of money, origin of birth or education. No one human is better, maybe more desirable, but in the end what was once deemed so important is useless without the honest love and respect from family and friends. Thinking you have the ability to look down on another only stops you from glancing up to see who was able to make it a little higher than yourself. How high do we think we can go before we start to push and shove the only One who looks down on us? When a person believes they have all the answers and feel superior, they soon find out how wrong they really were.

One person needs to feel more in power of another. Unfortunately in this country it would appear that many feel they know what is best for people.    They seem to disregard others feelings and think that what they "know is right" is the only way things should be done. Thusly we have a power struggle, and really all this is, is a major control complex of an entire group of people. They do not want to see it or hear about it and it's really rather sad.    It is part of human nature to desire power, at least this is what history has shown us. So from the teachings of history one can safely say that the desire of power is part of the human condition.|`|bd6865ca5da7d2603fd2ab5641cf8662aa	not essential. not even desirable.|`|6f4b6b1d52eab39deadce12b2f09c2c8aa	Yes.

It is as though  she feels better or stands taller when she thinks she knows more than someone else.    in a way i feel bad for her, to need to do that to make herself feel better!    I'm also wondering if it is a way for her to feel in control, because i get the idea that many things in her home life seem kinda crazy.    really... who's to say. just my observation.

I also feel, there is no point  in relegious people coming back at the homosexuals. No where it is said homosexuality is bad directly, though people might interpret something from nothing. I even know some mythologies which talk about (of course positively) homosexuality in their scripts.
48584e41c3755c58325aab9fac0133baaa	Hi.  Well I read your other question, and just to make sure I'm understanding correctly, you have a husband and kid and you want to stay with your husband for your kid's sake, but you really only like women.  The part I don't understand yet is if you're looking for support in staying in your relationship, looking for women to fool around with on the side, or looking for support in deciding what steps to take next such as whether or not you should leave him.    Now I just have some random disconnected thoughts about your questions, so here they are in no particular order:    Since you live near a big city there is going to be some sort of LGBT center in the area.  I would suggest looking them up and seeing what kinds of groups they offer.  You are in a situation that is pretty common.  They may have a group for married people such as yourself.  LGBT centers also usually have a socializing component so you could probably meet friends there, or at least learn about other things in the area that you might be interested in.    You also don't mention if your husband knows about this or not.  That makes a big difference in what kind of connections you can  make with people.  If you've been open about it with him then you can go to groups and meetings without having to make up excuses.  If he doesn't know that makes things more difficult.    If your husband doesn't know you might want to think about whether or not this is fair to him.  Is it fair for either of you to be in a loveless marriage, with him being clueless as to why the relationship isn't working, and him being unable to change the reason why things aren't working?  Imagine how frustrating that would be... to sense that something's off, to try to fix it, feeling like a failure for not being able to fix it, and never being told that you couldn't have fixed it to begin with.  I get that you like him as a great guy, but for both of you to be in a relationship where there is no physical intimacy isn't fair to either of you.  You're basically roommates who happen to have a kid in common.    Now, if he knows that you're a lesbian and is okay about it, some marriages like this work.  The straight person understands that the other person is a lesbian and they stay together for whatever reason is comfortable for them.  But, most marriages like this don't work.  That connection just isn't there.  A lot of resentment builds up.    You mention that you are staying with your husband for your son's sake.  While this is a very noble thing to do I'd like to offer a different viewpoint.  Kids are smart.  They know if something's wrong.  He will be able to sense the strain in your marriage, and this causes more trauma for a kid than divorce does.  Talk to adult kids of straight parents who should have divorced years ago but didn't "for the children."  They'll tell you exactly how stressful it was growing up in that kind of household.  Lots of tension and anxiety all the time.  Just not a healthy way for a kid to live.    Now obviously I can't tell you what option is best for you.  But I truly believe that it is never fair to anyone to pretend to be something you're not.  I would encourage you, no matter what you decide to do, to start individual therapy.  This way you have a place to talk about your situation and your feelings and you can come to your own conclusions about what to do.    P.S. This section is evenly split between LGBT people and their allies, and the Christian conservatives.  You will never get understanding answers from the conservatives so you just have to be prepared to ignore them.  As for the rest of us I read the replies and most people were pretty nice to you, even if they expressed frustration over the phrase "gay lifestyle."      I personally think that was a phrase cooked up by some fundamentalists trying to scare people.  The thing is that there's really no "gay lifestyle" to break into.  Gay lifestyle is not separate from straight lifestyle.  They totally mesh.  Since the "lifestyle" thing is a misconception that we hear multiple times a day, do you think you could forgive us for being just a tad exasperated when we hear it yet again?  Stick around this section more often and read some of the questions.  They make you laugh, they make you cry, they make you want to tear your hair out! :)|`|AA11468043	AH!  Cincinatti!  I lived in Newport for years and I can tell you that Cincinatti is great for gays!  Not necessarily geographically, but there are many orgs to join and bars to visit, if you're so inclined.

Best wishes!|`|oKRu5wOHaa	First I would guess you buy a flannel shirt. Then maybe cut your hair real butch-like.

Most lesbians I know (including myself) have learned that you won't have a lasting relationship with someone who has a guy at home. You can find women who will have sex with you, but they will disappear if they smell sausage in your home.    Secondly, you should try making some gay friends who could introduce you to someone.  Maybe use the internet personals to find lesbian singles in your area.  The personals can find lesbians in every city! If you find someone you want to meet, go meet her at some little diner or bar that you don't ever go to. You are not alone.  Good luck finding the women!|`|iyBvEzOgaa	just be friendly to every body and sooner or later ull find sum body tha like u     well if u tell then who u really are and they domt understand u then their really not ur friends    u only feel like u dont have friends maybe bcuz ur married tha why and alot of people think just bcuz ur married u cant don anything and tha ant ture|`|fcc4350d499fef4aae1c72be6f01cec4aa	I'm in the same situation.....let's "break into" it together!!!  ;)|`|EpK9wvf3aa	There are a lot of websites that can help you with this.

Do you feel like a bottom? Do you feel like a top? How do you feel about it?    When I had a bunk bed I switched between the two because I didn't have to share it, but when I had company I usually slept on the top bunk. I especially changed bedding positions during the seasons: Top during the winter, Bottom during the summer. Later on I got a loft bed completely eliminating a bottom bunk. So what does that make me? A rambler.|`|EpK9wvf3aa	I don't think so. But that is an interesting question.|`|AA10819547	No I think you always got the bottom bunk because you were a bottom :)|`|c8597904b477399309702aaa485592abaa	no, you lost on purpose because inside you WANTED the bottom bunk.

I offer respect to people based on their personality, with no consideration given to their sexual preference/orientation.    Fear of corruption, tribalism, insularisation are three reasons why people opt to not understand that basic concept.    People gain a sense of superiority, of tribal dominance, an affirmation of their "correctness", by insulting others who hold a different position.    Many/if not most people are taught tribal values by parents/families and so the cycle continues - until they rebel against it or are exposed to their object of hate and are reconciled to the understanding that it poses no threat to them or their tribe.|`|98d42b3215e62101caec29db98fba8c4aa	Insulting and disrespecting people makes certain people feel superior or better about themselves for some reason....sad, but true.

Maybe he is not cultured enough to appreciate it. Don't take it personally, treat it with the contempt it deserves.     If you really like him, try expressing your self in a way he understands.

If someone is well-dressed, well-groomed, and looks confident and happy, then they MUST be a believer, because only Christ could give someone that kind of spring in their step.  When you're told by your parents, ministers, etc. for your whole life that atheists are evil grumpy people with no joy, you're going to automatically make a broad generalization.
5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	Yes, but remember that all the hoping, wishing, and positive thinking in the world still can't account for another person's behavior.  In relationships, two parties come together, and you can't control that other party, although visualizing and positive thinking can help to make you more confident, and hence attractive- drawing in people to you.    Basically- don't just keep positive thinking; do something.  Go meet with people, or that special person on your mind.  Talk openly, go to places, take risks, and don't put all your eggs into one basket or believe you can positive think someone into your arms.  That's a recipe for disaster and frustration.  Instead, try to enjoy life fully while actively seeking love, instead of thinking things will be great once you get your significant other.  Be fulfilled with yourself first, and know that that's enough, and then you'll be ready for her or him!    Good luck.|`|7B9KEqCnaa	Pretty much by saying you will believe this to work 60% of the time you're putting a thought out there saying 60% of the time this will work for me and 40% of the time this will not work for me.  so what you attract is 60% of the time it will work for you and 40% it wont work for you.  That way it stays within your belief system.  For instance if you believe that tommorrow there is 100% chance you will wake up tommorrow and go and brush your teeth then tommorrow you will wake up and brush your teeth and there is no doubt about it.  But if you start thinking well there is always a chance i die in my sleep, and of course its saturday so i might end up being lazy, and in the past there was a few saturdays i didnt brush, then you will starting to manifest other thoughts into your original thoughts, and you will start to attract these other thoughts.|`|570261c91c4e4a67ecf001ec0322096baa	The brown dog was very fast....not as fast as the purple one.|`|AA10819547	Sounds like you mean the pseudo-magical Law of Attraction.

hmBLkOu7aa	The dialect that is taught depends on where the school is. I went to a school in Munster so I was taught Munster Irish. My friend went to school in Monaghan so she knows a totally different Irish to me. Teachers tend to teach the basics of other dialects as well so I would be able to understand the basics of say for example, Donegal Irish.|`|FyHaU0D6aa	For written works, they teach Standard Irish, which is a sort of mishmash of different dialects, but heavily biased towards the southern dialects, mostly Munster dialects and some Connacht dialects.    For listening comprehension, all dialects are taught compulsorily, though (as I understand it) the emphasis is still on Munster dialects most places. Of course, if the teacher is a native speaker (i.e., from a Gaeltacht area where they actually speak the dialects proper, rather than speaking an oral approximation of Standard Irish learnt through school), he will probably speak his own dialect to the students. And if the school is actually in a Gaeltacht area, any standard-imposed emphasis on certain dialects present in non-Gaeltacht area schools are bound to take a back seat to the local vernacular and dialect.

P544Sbmqaa	First and foremost, if a non Christian is telling a Christian that God isnt real, then arent they doing the exact same thing?    As far as the second part, my opinion is this...  ALL religions have the same core...  there is some sort of Supreme being or force, and the point of the religion or ideal is to show you right from wrong. I think many Chrisitans get wayyyy too caught up on specifics.  As far as why...  well, because they are taught that is what they are supposed to do.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Let's see *trying to follow along*.....I think your question is why do people disagree on what the bible says?

"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers" (2 Tim 4:3)    You, as an atheist, is the best reader of the bible, cause you wil take it all by yourself, making your own searchings and logics. These kind of people gets the same interpretations:    God is one in three people (1oJohn 5:7)  Jesus is the Son of God who saves us of our sins (John 3:6)  Jesus will return (Rev 1:7)  Baptism in water in only for adults cause it's need to believe first (Mark 16:16).   Baptism is in the name of the trinity (Mat 28:19)  Salvation is only through grace (Ephesians 2:5-8)  Baptism with the Holy Spirit is actual (Mark 16:16-17)    Who reads the bible with NO FEAR to desagree with the pastor or any leader of any religion and with no will to pleausure his own ideas, will believe those statements above. I'm a living proof of it. I left many beliefs I had because of pastors and other people when I start to make my own thougthts and so I got that all as any christian who is not afraid of the doctrine of the apostles.|`|JREs9K0Gaa	I don't get upset when someone says God isn't real because that's only their opinion based solely on their experiences which probably don't match my experiences.|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	I don't believe we do argue over the books at least the hierarchy in the churches don't argue, there are some lame brains on here that make a fuss about the Catholic Bible, I don't believe that we can judge that I will leave that to God to speak to the hearts of those that are wrong. For my self I refuse to argue with anyone about their believe or disbelief that again is between them and God. I will correct misrepresented scripture.

I am one of the belief that faith is the work of God and no man can give another the faith in God, God has to do this Himself or through another person as instrument.  That is why unless the signs from God is very clear that He wanted to use me to share my faith to another, I leave everybody alone in their belief or lack of belief in God.|`|PgJcYuYvaa	For a christian to say they don't push belief is a lie.Im a christian man and the bible tells me to teach and I do.If you may you can call that pushing beliefs on another,but then everyone is guilty of that,don't care who you are.I myself found something you said rather intriguing.I say all the time,Im mad that most quote the same stuff and leave out the important stuff that is to be a christian person.   Most separation in church comes from mans desire to be righteous and seek their on type that will allow them to live how they want,not what was meant to be.It did not take anything more to meet the way you asked this answer to be deal with.Just the challenge of not being judgmental which I love to take on that has been a flaw of mine.I don,t let people hurt my feelings so don't be sorry,just don't judge all on some.I only know less then 50 people that are christian that think as I do.Most people that say their christ followers that hate me for my beliefs.   When you make the point that we can't talk without attacking you then phrase without attack.I hope this is the answer that you thought nobody could give.
0e1ba7890e6cc2c7a440148180d77516aa	Hindi is very easy to learn.  Since you're exposed to Hindi almost everywhere you go, you should have no problem.    The good thing about Hindi is that you will be able to understand basic Urdu (and maybe a little Punjabi). You could also speak Hindustani, a mix between Hindi and Urdu. Hindustani is commonly spoken in India.    Ask a friend to help you, talk to you, etc. Watch hindi films, music, tv, etc.    There are some difficulties especially with pronunciation...but Wikipedia explains them better than I do:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi Commo...    By the way, my parents speak Hindi, so that's why I can understand it, and I try to speak it. But, they never taught me how to read/write. So, I taught myself when I went to India by looking at signs written in Hindi and English.     It's good to have someone there to help you if you have any questions. A dictionary is useful, too. (I just don't use one 'cause I can ask my parents. xP)     Also, practice!    Hope this helps. :)|`|F9LzgYZ0aa	As hard as answering this question.|`|7d2725bc0bef1a56b31813612fc6c6f4aa	It should be fairly easy.

So if you cater to this market area, you may have tapped a profitable idea.|`|gOo3qtPcaa	From a business perspective I would say advertise where you think you will get the most for your money. Yellow pages in general are no longer used by many people, gay or otherwise, since many people go to the internet to find things now. Having said that I don't think advertising in the gay yellow pages would hurt you, I just don't think it would get you a return on your marketing dollars. Instead I would look for ways to get involved in the community by supporting charities (gay and non-gay) and contributing your product or service to help causes raise money and build relationships with the community. Often these charities hold auctions or put the name of your business in their marketing materials.   I am a business owner and put an ad in the gay yellow pages but didn't get the return I felt was equal to the cost of the ad.

I don't think they fear non-straights for being different, I think they dislike (despise) their imaginings of our bedroom activities (not necessarily us, per se) borne from our being differently wired.  A tribal thing, it reinforces their sense of security by denigrating (am I still allowed to use that word given it's roots? LOL!) that which is different.    The world IS too politically correct.  There was a time I could call my mineral companions "pet rocks" (sorry for any offense) - but not anymore.    It is not the words they use, it is the venom behind those words.  Similarly, pointing out inconsistencies and flaws in their position is healthy - subjectivity isn't.    The irony in all of this is that it does more damage to bite back (contemptuously) at their insults and attitude than to use rationality to explain why they should adopt a new stance.  I think that Gay Rights have progressed sufficiently since the sixties (though still a ways to go!), that we can afford to adopt a more adult approach to fighting for equivalence.    EDIT: My answer then is it's a poor example of irony and I think your use of of the word "xenophobia" implies fear of us from our being different and I dispute that the majority of Hets (including those who speak out against us) have an irrational fear of us based on that difference.  Rather, I think that they are just rallying against that which runs counter to their experience (which does not indicate xenophobia).    My point, in what I wrote earlier, is that I don't consider there to be any merit in pointing out the idiosyncrasies of those who "oppose".  It is just the same tribal pointscoring when, really, we are all one tribe.  Less polemic - more backbiting.|`|730dd326e853a6c8595cc8db173220e7aa	They always contradict themselves.|`|9ec35917d025a7ccee6694d73df14964aa	i think people like to complain about whatevers going on around them, yno the war, gays, blacks or whatever its not like anything can be done about any of it by us little people anyway.|`|4b4ac22b307d13575f5331020f87b798aa	It's sad irony.

Do these people not remember that little "judge not..." speech.  Very ironic that in their haste to condemn others for what they perceive to be sinful they themselves are sinning.  Ha.  Funny stuff.

Aside from that it is a matter of degree.  He doesn't need to be a paragon of social compliance but from what you describe he may be too far away from socialised.  Rudeness is a relative concept.  It is possible that he comes from a background where belching and farting in public are perfectly acceptable.  Your way isn't necessarily the way he knows.  Maybe he IS complying with the set of social rules he grew up with.    But the bottom line here is the customers.  If he is off-putting to the customers he needs to moderate himself.

yHfsHp6naa	You don't get the logic, because you just can't make sense out of nonsense.|`|K8kmbxZVaa	First God didn't sacrifice himself, his son Jesus did. In the Garden of Eve, Adam and Eve sinned against God so badly it was impossible for them to go to heaven. That sin is called Original sin. Every person is born with it. It is hereditary because Adam and Eve are the parents of everyone (they were the first humans). Original Sin made it impossible for any human to go to heaven. Original sin is only gotten rid of by baptism.      God would not abandon his most Beautiful creation to suffer an eternity in hell. He sent his son Jesus to suffer and die. When he died he went to Hell for three days to make all the souls that lived a good life went to heave, Jesus doing that made it possible for all humans to go to heaven.       No Jesus dieing does not completely get rid of sins. Jesus on earth instituted the Catholic faith. Jesus made it possible to go to heaven because he made the sacrament of Reconciliation. That is going to a priest confessing your sins, by doing that your sins are erased. Original sin was so great it could only be gotten rid of by God's own so, Jesus dieing a painful death and going to hell to free those souls then going to heaven to be seated at the right hand of the Father. Even then Baptism is needed to get rid of Original sin.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	i say he did not die for our sins, he died because he was found to be a blasphemer and through the secret combination  of the chief judges and few followers, he was killed for political reasons, Not justifiable, as concluded by Pilate who washed his hands of his blood.     pilate declare i find nothing wrong with him. He sent jesus back to caiphus and caiphus sent him back to pilate. Pilate gave the people a choice. they chose barabus.     jesus was knew how to manipulate the bible in better debates against the pharisees and the saducees and could rebuke all of them all the time. jesus died because They felt threatened at the miracles and the knowledge and teachings of jesus.     to be redeemed of sins, is to forsake them and repent. Jesus taught that sins should be repented of! thats how he rids humans of their sins by instruction in righteousness.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	By doing that His Justice for our sins was accomplish.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	If you're really curious, then you should read this, if not, then don't waste your time.    There is one major reason that Jesus had to die.  Many people will say that there is no forgiveness without the shedding of blood, and that is true, but it is not the major reason.    The primary reason is that God is a just God.  In the same way that a just judge cannot let a murderer go without a punishment, so God cannot let us go without a punishment.     The best way to understand this is with an analogy.    Let's say that you are on trial for murder (just an example :)  ).  The judge approaches the bench, and says that you have been sentenced to death, and your only way out of that would be to pay a $1,000,000 fine for the life of the other person.  You don't have anywhere close to the million, and there is no way that you could come up with the money.      Just as the judge is about to pass the death sentence on you, a man steps up that you don't know.  He says that he is the brother of the man that you killed, and he says that he has sold his house, his car, and everything he had, and was able to raise that million dollars.  He offers to pay the fine for you, and you accept it.  The judge is able to let you go, because the sentence was fulfilled and the fine was paid.      In the same way, we are all set up for the punishment for the sins that we have commited, and our sentence is death.  Jesus took the punishment of our sins upon Himself, and died on the cross.  But just like we would have to accept that million dollars, we have to accept His paying the price for us, and trust in Him.    My favorite way to think about it is this: He lived the perfect life that we should have lived, and died the shameful death that we should have died.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Because the "wages of sin is death". A penalty must be paid for ALL sins. Ours is a God of justice. He sacrificed Himself because only a perfect sacrifice would do, and only He is perfect.   If He hadn't, we would all be forced to pay for our own sins ourselves - which would mean permanent death for all humanity. There would be no one in Heaven.|`|7iFVbir1aa	see..this is your failure    god is not a concept|`|MNl2HmXRaa	Don't try to figure it out, you'll only hurt your brain from the overload of ridiculousness...|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	It does seem to me that there would be no need for this to accomplish forgiveness.    If I want to forgive someone I don't need to die for it to happen.  It just doesn't make sense.  I just forgive them - don't we all?    I'm having a hard time with some of the answers saying that god's son died.  Either god is one or three but it can't be both - make up your minds.  Besides which the trinity/union dichotomy is even less logical than the need for a death to precede forgiveness - it's hardly a supporting argument.|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	It was JESUS, not God himself.  Jesus offered to come to the earth to teach people about God and to let us know what God expects from us and he came to be an example.|`|AsyB1qLyaa	Every human is a sinner, so any person would have to pay for his/her own sins first (eternity in hell). So that doesn't work. Only someone without sins--God--can pay for sins. However, God is eternal and can't die. So, there's the incarnation. God the Son takes "manhood" upon Himself. Now, God can die.|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	You have no Bible understanding. That is why you are puzzled by this. First of all, God did not come to earth to die for us but his son did. We aren't that important. Jesus died for the sins that we inherited from Adam. The sin he committed were passed on to all of his children. Since none of us had any choice in whether Adam sinned or not, we are innocent. When Adam sinned he lost the ability to live forever on the paradise earth. God's rule is that a sacrifice had to be made equal to the sin. Adam was a perfect man yet he sinned and lost our eternal life. Jesus was a perfect man and the only one who could sacrifice his life so that we may have the opportunity to live forever in the paradise earth when God restores it to such. But, we commit other sins besides the problem of being born into sin. We have to repent and turn around in order for those sins to be forgiven us.  Jesus sacrifice just makes it possible for us to live eternally.  We have to make it happen by listening and following in Jesus' footsteps|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	You are absolutely on target... and Christ himself would agree with you. He said: "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice." He was quoting Hosea 6:6, which appears to be a condemnation of the idea of sacrifice for sins.    "Christ died for our sins" came from Paul/Saul, who was the one who terrorized the first Christians. So you are right and the theologians are very wrong. This will clear up all the confusion if you want to know the whole story... and why we got stuck with this bad theology.. http://gospelenigma.com|`|AA10747442	It is a picture of the innocent dying for the guilty !!! Substitutionery    Hebrews 10     1The law is only a shadow of the good things that are comingnot the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. 2If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. 3But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, 4because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.    5Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said:      "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,         but a body you prepared for me;    6with burnt offerings and sin offerings         you were not pleased.    7Then I said, 'Here I amit is written about me in the scroll         I have come to do your will, O God.' "[a] 8First he said, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them" (although the law required them to be made). 9Then he said, "Here I am, I have come to do your will." He sets aside the first to establish the second. 10And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.|`|vprXuK2Kaa	what God sacrificed himself to rid humans of their sins.... if you are referring to the Christian God.. that God sacrificed his son, lol|`|ctCBcw41aa	People sacrificed lamb for thier sins and since sin seperates us from God the only way back to god was by the blood of jesus christ jesus christ is righteouss and perfect and holy and he knew no sin had no sin in him so all of our sins were put upon him so when he died and rose he defeated death and all those who accept jesus when god looks at us God doesn't see our sins but he see the righteouss of jesus in us and because of that jesus made a passage available for us to go back to god now.|`|3C9HbM8naa	Because God sacrificed his life and his blood shed pays for all the sins in the world that are forgiven

People just relax and have fun in their showers.|`|nWsDbTVraa	I am not 100% sure about the accuracy of this, but on the TV show Brainiac, they said that you sing in the shower because running water contains positive ions which gives your body a natural happiness and to express this most people sing or dance.  Again, I am not sure of it's accuracy cause it sounds like a load of crap, but that's what they said!|`|tMvHR1n3aa	lol i dont sing in the shower period,,..... idont knw why people do it maybe cause u can hear your self better? .|`|qWOLmHmWaa	i think its that you have nothing better to do, the sound drowns it out a little makes you seem like a better singer. And its the security of it not that your afriad to sing or anything just that it feels more natural when your alone in the shower. It could just be a natural thing i know a lot of people who do it?

36ukxyZPaa	Its all very well saying you're a black woman,   and i know how frustrating that show must have been to watch.    But I do honestly think its the White Brits who are even more frustrated by those complete mongs, more so than Brits of ethnic origin.     Overall i think that party is a load of b*llocks, and they all need to have their testicles stapled to a sandwhich.      Its embarrasing that fools like that still exist, and Im equally embarrassed on behalf of the sane white-brits that people assume are all like that.   We're not!  I swear!   Its just those uncultured buffoons.      EDIT:  To "Private".   I dispise the labour government equally.|`|i405qKokaa	It looked badly edited and to be honest it looked like the whole "documentary" was doing everything it could to discredit the BNP and make them look stupid. They picked misfits, used corny backing music and it certainly wasn't impartial or unbiased.   Although I'm no lover of BNP, I certainly felt for them when I watched this as it was clearly set-up. Maybe it gives credence to some of the BNP members who claim that the media is biased against them-watching this "documentary" made that quite clear.  As for my views, although I'm no supporter of any of their racial views, I think that over time they may soften their stance, as they already have a Jewish councellor in the south.I hope they do anyway, as their policies on Capital Punishment and forcing chavs to do military service are attractive!|`|k6fGdpZRaa	BNP- make me sick. Women on doc- I feel like shaking them! It would have been funny if it weren't slightly depressing.  You an't even argue with people so THICK!!!|`|1c4d63e270980835467d6ecccf8456c3aa	I didn't see the BNP wives program but my opinion on BNP is they are a bunch of bigots. I mean what gives them the right to say who should and shouldn't live in our country, we are all equal regardless of the colour of our skin (mines a pinky colour lol)   I have just read up a little on their policies and exactly what they stand for and there are 2 things i can see that should be put to the government 1) that repossessed homes should become council houses, to prevent these being sold off cheaply to undercut private sellers, and to provide housing for those who need it.  2) The party supports animal welfare and environmental policies, supporting Greenpeace in its fight against Japanese whaling ships and the RSPCA's campaign against the docking of dogs' tails.  Other than those 2 i can't see any good they do, they're anti Islam, Anti Homosexuality, Anti anyone who isn't of English origin, but this includes anyone without white skin. Maybe it's them that we should be driving out of the country, not that it'd stop there will always be racist people with very shallow minds.|`|8ovTppsAaa	Actually,any fool could see that the whole show was designed around belittling the BNP.    The films editing focused on the comments of those of low IQ and characters adorned with tatttoes lying around.    I can assure you that New Labour can field many more voting louts and thickos waving the red banner.    Pond life is not unique to the BNP.  What is unique to the BNP is the ability to bat off smear campaigns and malicious editing whilst gradually gathering support from all over Britain.  Not every person who votes for the BNP can be tarred with the same brush.hence ,there must be some sense coming through.  Unfortunately,there are still many people who perpetually reiterate the government cliches they learned from their leftist teachers,that the BNP are "racist" and "bigots".Our country would be so much better if these naive fools of New Labour looked up these definitions in a dictionary and then carefully read through the BNP manifesto followed by a few truths from right wing websites that never make it to the press.    Unfortunately,these types of people dont want to learn,preferring to spout ignorant remarks on a trendy and tribal basis as demonstrated by some of the posters.        Finally,who says the BNP rhetoric is "hate" of blacks?  The BNP stance is that all are respected but Britain is for the British.The real British,not those who came by the title through poor government.    edit@single    Nick Griffin was speaking the truth and not insulting anyone.    He was arrested after a sting by the ultra leftwing BBC and the weight that Tony Blair and his blackshirts put behind toppling the party that was taking votes from them.    Nick Griffin was aquitted on all counts and therefore innocent.  You lose!  In fact you are a classic example of the ignorant assuming the moral highground of which I already mentioned.  You are not alone,there are many others,conditioned by your teachers and you the BBC to act in a particular way if you want to remain popular.  Any old leftist cause will do.  Well done,you are popular!  However,it is left to those with the guts and the thick skins to fight for the survival of this country so that people like you can have the freedom to be ignorant.|`|DVGJWZMyaa	I think its because BNP's philosophy is based on fear and hatred rather than facts and reason. They think don't need to justify why they hate blacks, Muslim's etc. because they and all their friends always hear that they are scary, bad and not to be trusted ... from all their other friends.    A lot of these people are very insular and don't actually know any people from other backgrounds. I live in a place with a strong BNP presence and even though I am white British I am treated with suspicion because I was not born here. In a nearby village they have a proud saying that describes it all "Wyke Wyke, We're all alike".|`|ZJ3D377qaa	They're just a bunch of racist idiots who no-one takes seriously. Anyone who's a different colour or religion is a threat to them. I'm a muslim and a British citizen but they probably wouldnt consider me British because of my religion and the fact I'm black. They remind me of Nazi's. I think they only represent a minority in this country though.|`|2edceb6d7bc843b046e876b19318a18caa	I found the thing a bit sad really. If the BNP types think that kicking every racial minority out would improve this country they're sadly mistaken. It's the same old simple policies from simple out of touch people who's idea of political debate is to go on the offensive when questioned on their viewpoint. As soon as one woman asked them about their opposition to a mosque being built she was labelled a "fat slag". Many white English people may disagree with the soft government approach to dealing with minorities. I for one believe that no one should receive good or bad treatment based specifically on their race and the stereotype attached. Take people as you find them i say.|`|w7qEwaDyaa	yes i f*****g hated it! espessially when the white woman said she didnt want a black woman to deliver her baby! what cheek!

NvzA9V8eaa	Do you need an adapted vehicle?  ie. hand controls, steering knob, pedal extensions    If so you may have no choice but to go through a rehab place--not a regular driving school.    this is a link I found when I searched Virginia Driver Rehab    http://www.dmv.state.va.us/webdoc/pdf/cd...    Here's another one    http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/dsb/driving...      This is a list of regular driving schools    http://www.aboutdrivingschools.com/drivi...      You may be able to get started with a rehab place-and once they have you physically set up in the car--you may be able to work with a regular place---as long as you have your own car that is adapted    I can't imagine someone is the social security office doing extra work--its hard enough to get them to follow throguh on their primary job---the most they may be expected to do would be to refer you to vocational rehab-which puts you right back in the beginning.    It is not a function of the Social Security office--and people think they are rude when they are asked Social Security questions--They would probably be even ruder when asked to do more than their job.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well yes they can.|`|BevylvVSaa	No, that is not the role of Social Security.     You better learn to get along with your rehab office or get a license at the tremendous cost.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	It all depends on the person you contact in each agency. I've had one vocational rehab counselor out of 4 who was helpful. I've had two medicaid social workers out of 3.    It's not something specifically in their job description, but you might luck out & find someone to help you. I've found it's all very individual. I've literally spent 6 hrs on the phone calling govt agencies, social svcs, charities, etc for various forms of assistance. It takes talking to a lot of ppl & you definitely get tired of telling the same details over & over, but you've got to "kiss a lot of frogs" so to speak.     Maybe the dept of motor vehicles has ideas of different schools or agencies other than your rehab office. That's how I found my private instructor.     Also, depending on your age you can contact your school (or former high school, if you've graduated). They have a list of instructors for public & private lessons.|`|03GQ637Raa	Study your driving manual.  Get your learners permit.  Practice driving and go for your road test.  Do it the right way, don't take any short cuts.  You will be able to get a disability license plate and license.  There is no shortcut, do it the right way and you will feel much better.
qbb9YiRsaa	if your parents have made such a strong statement against gay people I don't know if there is much that you can do at this point.  How old are you?  They sound very very strongly against it, probably because they dont' understand.  You could say something along the lines of "you have a friend that is gay" and see what kind of conversation comes around.  Find out what they truly have against gay people.  You can say you know your friend and he/she isn't what they say.  Sometimes there is no getting to people though and you have to accept that.  You may have to move out.  This tends to show the parents though what they have done.  I'm sure they love you and they will be conflicted if you are gay as you won't fit into their beliefs about the "uncleanliness" of gay people.|`|xsuHDhIzaa	dats a really hard one. ur parents seem like they are very strong about their judgement on this and may not be able to changed. this is no wat offensive to ur parents so please dont think i am being rude but i once heard a saying it was ..."u cant learn an old dog new tricks". it just means that if they are set they wnt change their mind.    you could wait till ur set in life, ur own house, job everything and when ur supporting urself fully you could let them know.     i really do hope everything turns out well for.    good luck    =]|`|lL5lKNIiaa	That is really sad that people are still like that in todays society and I am sorry that you have to struggle with it. my roommates girlfriend's (they are lesbians) mother is the same way. my girlfriends mother is the same way. we have been going out still for almost 2 years but we still have to keep it a secret. we someday really hope to be able to tell her paernts but we are still scared.|`|Xef2mbGcaa	I honestly don't think you should tell them.At least not now, do it when you think they've loosened up about the subject.|`|nisfxpXHaa	You can't make anyone do anything, I suggest you wait until your living on your own and supporting yourself before coming out to them.

n560blqraa	Absolutely your daughter's father should pay child support. He helped to create that child and now he needs to help pay for it. Child support payments should not be a choice by your ex, it is his obligation to help pay for your daughter's necessities in life. In addition, it will also help to offset the current cost of what your mother is paying for, while she and you are living there.|`|34gadhWaaa	yeagh|`|JQIztxIlaa	Sure.|`|AA11674544	definitely, because the grandmother can stop any time and the daughter needs stability so she can finish her education.      Unless of course, asking for CS will cause the father to be out of the daughter's life. The daughter would be better off if you could come to some reasonable arrangement that does not include the courts. Maybe he could fix the car, change the oil, do household repairs, etc. It doesn't have to be ugly. And going to a judge always makes it uglier. So, If you have a reasonable relationship with the father, ask him to help her. If he is going to be useless and not help, THEN take him to court. good luck.
AA11124121	it's my birthday..the 13th..    i don't give whit about it either.    The first recorded issue with the 13th being not good.    [Rossini] was surrounded to the last by admiring and affectionate friends; and if it be true that, like so many other Italians, he regarded Friday as an unlucky day, and thirteen as an unlucky number, it is remarkable that on Friday, the 13th of November, he died.[6]|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Friday, a certain person got crucified.  Not a good day for him.    Last supper: 13 at the table.  Unlucky for some.  The two together ...    Your husband suffers from paraskavedekatriaphobia, apparently.  Meaning, an irrational fear of that particular date.  I think someone made that word up.  Triskaidekaphobia, fear of the number 13, is a bit more plausible.    Typically, houses with the no.13 are harder to sell so if you're not superstitious you might be able to get a bargain.  For the same reason, when new estates are built, there might not BE a house no.13.|`|ccZuEOEfaa	I don't know the history of it.

This year my birthday is Friday 13th, and my parents were married on a Friday the 13th and have just had their 25th anniversary!  So it's not unlucky for everyone.

AA11496874	let's think|`|AA10819547	This question would have been better being posted in Etiquette.  However a few tips for you.    Don't drink more than a couple of glasses of wine/beer - barely enough to relax you.    Make the effort to engage in conversation - doesn't have to be more than "Hi I'm Armyleen_rivera, how do you do? I like your [item of clothing/accessory] where did you get it?"    Don't let pregnant pauses build up with the person to whom  you're speaking, instead say something like "Okay, pleasure meeting you I'm going to mingle/go to the bar/ powder my nose..." and move onto another person with whom to repeat.    Most of all, give the impression that you're at ease by not standing rigid and with eyes like a rabbit caught in headlights.  Instead walk slowly, relax your shoulders and smile.|`|5610ddfd0ee2603f3e30ca84658fa5d6aa	I used to be the same way...to the exact but I am over it now and you could be to.

Talk to everyone you come in contact with. make sure you are yourself and you do not over due it. People love people who can mingle with just about any type of person..gay, straight or whatever. Do not sweat it if someone is not as responsive as you that means they will not have as good of time as you. Keep this all in mind and go in with positive combat on and I bet you will meet a lot of cool new people.

LKRXCFuWaa	Ok people, a few things to review:    1) ALL Catholic Seminarians in the United States are required to take a battery of psychological and physical exams along with multiple interviews, recommendations, and reviews before and during the seminary process. We are evaluated twice every year and must submit to any requested psychological exams prescribed by our faculty    2) Over 95% of sexual predators are married men with families. Having sex or being married is NOT in any way a preventative.    3) A school teacher is 50 times more likely to be a sexual predator than a priest. A politician is about 200 times more likely. While we do not condone a single act of abuse and deplore what the sick individuals did to others, our screening process has been much better than others. Still, it is a human institution. Try as we might, we are not perfect in the capacity to consider another person's motives, though we do well.    4) Celibacy in the Catholic tradition is not a rejection of sex. Catholics like sex, look how big our families are! Celibacy is embraced for the sake of the Kingdom, for practical purposes, and to allow the Priest to become a father of the Church, espoused to the Church and able to give all of his love and attention to his community, rather than a wife. I've asked dozens of married ministers, their children and their friends. While there are thousands of wonderful ministers, nearly all indicated to me that the choice between family and congregation is one of their most challenging and hurtful in their daily lives. Priests are blessed with celibacy, not hampered by it.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	Well, Christ never said that clergy couldn't marry. Rabbis get married, pastors marry... why the RCC won't change their Dark Ages mentality and make it so priests can marry and have a real life is beyond me. Those who are pedophiles need to be locked up just like anyone else. No more money from the Vatican to sweep the problem under the rug. I agree, they do need to give them psychological tests as well.|`|GRAYktltaa	Do these men enter the priesthood thinking God will take away the naughty thoughts if they become priests?    Is it celebacy that does this to their minds?

1YJOlRd4aa	Testosterone has a strong effect on the libido of a adult.  I add three excerpts from wikipedia with the link to the source below.  Also listed in the sources is the BBC article mentioned in the third excerpt.    "Examples include enhanced libido, energy, immune function, and protection against osteoporosis. On average, the adult male body produces about twenty to thirty times the amount of testosterone that an adult female's body does."    "Adult testosterone effects are more clearly demonstrable in males than in females, but are likely important to both sexes. Some of these effects may decline as testosterone levels decline in the later decades of adult life.    Maintenance of muscle mass and strength   Maintenance of bone density and strength   Libido and erection frequency  Mental and physical energy"    "Recent research has suggested that alcohol consumption in women can temporarily raise testosterone levels. A 2006 BBC article states: "According to medical research, testosterone - the hormone connected to male characteristics such as aggression and sex drive - rises in women by up to 50% when they get drunk. In men, it falls"|`|AA10819547	We are each equally sexual given that we are totally one sex or the other.

facf83677c10d1efd1fcc713e838bdd2aa	i have found that a lot of lesbian and bisexual girls will drop subtle and not so subtle hints. like for example i was at the tattoo shop the other day and i noticed this girl looking at me.. then her and this guy got on the subject of tongue piercings. she says to the guy 'i got my tongue pierced a year ago' (then proceedes to show him) and he's like 'yeah thats cool, i like girls that have thier tongues peirced' then she says 'i didnt get it pierced for the GUYS'     that off-handed comment was her way of letting me know she was into girls without having to say it straight out. if a girl is into you listen for those type of off handed comments that she might make to you or somebody else within listening distance.|`|AA10819547	don't ask...don't get.|`|d91ae4c99ffceddbf7f91d9b902988a5aa	Well you don't know just by looking but if you don't inquire then you'll never know.

A lot of times its to see what your wearing, your hairstyle and things like that.  Although most times they look away when you look back but if they keep looking at you then its possible.    But to be honest, you NEVER REALLY know unless you actually ask the girl.  The best way to tell is if you go to a gay/lesbian bar or club. Or look online :-)   I want a GF too but you know, for some people, if you STOP looking, just enjoy what you have right now (family, friends, hobby...etc) .... then the right person will come along when you're not expecting it. :-)

My grandfather use to say "My right to swing my elbow stops at the other guy's nose"  -- Anotherwards,  there are OTHER people around besides ourselves.  Our personal right to do as we please, ends when it affects someone else.     The problem is, with more and more people on this planet.. our personal space is getting smaller and smaller.  How our lives can affect others is getting more complex.    Unfortunately, there is more and more people who only think in terms of "their rights" and not other people's.     Think about it,  as the web of interconnections gets more complex and there are MORE people on this planet.. our ability to realize how our actions affect others is simply not keeping up. On top of that,  I think a fair number of us, maybe even the majority, are feeling LESS  connected to each other, because there is simply too many of us to keep track of and the interconnections, the web of cause and results is soo complex, people simply say "I don't care, screw 'em" -- thus we get MORE self - centered and more isolated.     I think it is a weird phenomenon if you think about it.  -- The more restrictions and complexity we have..the less connected we feel.     Back a hundred years ago,  most people lived rurally and there were at least a couple of acres between you and the person next to you.  Towns were smaller.  World News traveled slower.  One could limit his/her interactions with the world and thus feel MORE connected.     It was easier to be considerate of others when you only had to be around a couple of thousand people.    NOW, a small town is 60,000 and large cities are in the millions.       YEAH,  our actions affect others..but even knowing that.. can you know HOW it will affect others?  Can you stop and take time to be considerate of all those OTHER people?  -- NO, it is just too complex.

If person 2 was late for a meeting and lost a large potential client, then yes. If they could have saved a life had then been home a few minutes sooner, yes. Those then turn into big things.    But more often than not person 2 isn't going to be late for anything that will still matter tomorrow and he/she is likely acting like an impatient driver for no reason.|`|4Zbjx8bCaa	It is called the butterfly affect.    most famously.

There might be a universe in which person 2 didn't slow down, drove into the back of person 1's car, causing an accident; as a result of which person 2 was taken to hospital where he met a nurse with whom he fell in love and married.  So now he's the father of children who would not otherwise have existed ... and who DON'T exist in the universe you described originally.    Fascinating though this is to contemplate I don't, unlike you, think that God has much to do with it.|`|pYimIJAWaa	You'd probably get some very different responses if you also post this in the physics section...|`|AsyB1qLyaa	Yes, we do.

GDexucXKaa	The Halal method is MEANT to be humane.  Among the rules for halal slaughter:  the animal is not to be killed within the sight/hearing of other animals, as that will upset the others; and before it's killed it is given a drink of water to make it comfortable.     The death may not be as instantaneous is the air bullet to the brain, but I really don't think it's significantly worse, either.|`|yOK32PM9aa	No, but scientists have proven that modern high-velocity weapons are much kinder on their targets than primitive old muskets.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	You are completely backwards.  Kosher and Halal ARE the humane ones.    Please read up a definition and ask the question later.      You don't need a scientific test to determine the definition.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	We are a fickle people softened by modern convenience unable to handle it.  Not like our ancestors who lived in it all their days, use to it, not thinking a thing of it, just being a part of life.|`|AA11008046	there is no better way that the kosher system practised by the Jewish folk|`|aj5IBTuXaa	In skilled hands, the animal subject to kosher/halal ritual very quickly loses consciousness due to blood pressure loss.  After that, no pain.  If the knife is sharp enough, the pain is slow to kick in.    Modern slaughter?  HAH!  They can't use chemicals that would kill the animal 'cause that might kill us.  So that leaves electrocution - sometimes quick, sometimes not.  Or bludgeoning with a pneumatic ram to the forehead.  But for thick-skulled animals, that might need repeating too.  It still comes back to the skill of the executioner.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Take a look at the amazing woman called Temple Grandin. She's deeply autistic woman - and a professor of animal studies - who has used her 'disability' to gain an insight into how animals think and feel.    She has redesigned the modern slaughterhouse in a way that keeps the animals feeling calm and contented at every stage. They literally don't know what hits them. It's reduced costs and been hailed as a breakthrough by animal rights groups.|`|nGZ42YXyaa	certain methods of killing the animal do not cause all the blood to come out or kill the animal instantly to keep it away from misery. Halal meat is blessed and other reasons....also, it is killed  a certain way to instantly kill the animal,. I dont understand why anyone would want to  make the animal suffer, its insane to do that. Also, the way the animal is slaughtered causes almost all the blood to leave the body,..other methods still have the blood in the meat which is extremely unhealthy. Don't think that just because it is important to a religion, that it doesn't provide importance to the well -being of the person. Halal meat (an extremely important aspect of islam) is also for the individual's health.   Oh, and also i dont want to forget to say this: In islam, you are NEVER supposed to kill the animal in front of other animals, or if the animal is not in a healthy condition itself (even emotionally) if the animal is much to scared, then it is not to be slaughtered.   Sorry i strayed from the topic, but i had to mention some of this as many people say that they see no reason for the process.  It is NOT inhumane, the truth is, other methods are inhumane, u dont have to follow the religion to believe this either.....to say something is inhumane because it looks inhumane is just silly. It's like judging a book by its cover. People should think what they say about something. You need FACTS....what's inhumane is killing those animals in a way that makes them suffer.   Sorry that  i can't provide anything on Kosher meat...|`|fQmJSlEyaa	how can hanging an animal upside down and letting it bleed to death  be humane . I'm just glade I am a vegetarian.|`|379b50dce4fc66c5c2a45e76914bd311aa	1) the way I've heard some high-volume slaughterhouses do it, I can see why people would say its inhumane.  2) I think sometimes people are just unreasonably squeamish, or using bad-case examples rather than how it usually works.  3) most people compartmentalize that the meat in their grocery store was once a living, breathing animal.    >"The Halal method is MEANT to be humane. Among the rules for halal slaughter: the animal is not to be killed within the sight/hearing of other animals, as that will upset the others; and before it's killed it is given a drink of water to make it comfortable."  same goes for kosher slaughter,  and I highly doubt that kosher slaughter, when done as its supposed to be, is remotely inhumane.    >"how can hanging an animal upside down and letting it bleed to death be humane . I'm just glade I am a vegetarian."  1) I think that its SUPPOSED to be that the animal has the vessels cut before it is hung upside down.;     if the blood is suddenly drained from its head, so it goes unconcious and dies, what happens after that point is rather irrelevant to the animal.    I mean if your head is cut off, such that you don't even realize that a cut was made until you are suddently irresistably sleepy and become unconcious, ... if your body is then put into a wood chipper or somethin, the second after your head is severed... you aren't going to notice.
O0lb4Kcnaa	Why don't you just ask him why he flat out told you that he was buying a wii when he obviously did not?  Don't bring up the perfume, it was the thought.     It's not ~ not getting the wii that would bother me.  It's why he would tell you that he was buying an expensive gift and didn't.    As for the watch, did you buy it because he asked you for it ort because you thought that you had to spend just as much money on him as he did you? Quite honestly if you bought the watch expecting an expensive gift in return then you need to re evaluate the reason why you're in a relationship to begin with.|`|Likst1Mxaa	I'd exchange the perfume and the boyfriend at the refunds counter.

You seem nice, but unfortunately you seem pretty passive. You should tell him that it was not nice of him to do that..... I am sure you have told him that though. How much did you spend on the watch? Because maybe he found out that maybe you didnt spend as much as he wanted you to spend, so he bought you something a lot cheaper. I hope that you tell him how you really feel....and good luck

When you get beyond what man can do you get within the realms of miracles; and it is just as easy to believe the miracle of Jonah as any other miracle in the Bible.    MR. DARROW--Perfectly easy to believe that Jonah swallowed the whale?    MR. BRYAN--If the Bible said so.    So there's one famous literalist at least for whom nothing was too hard for the Lord.    John 11.35 is the only appropriate response I can think of.    "Jesus wept".|`|0vmQNf0oaa	That would be more believable than the univers just deciding to exist.|`|zQyslfHKaa	Of course they would.

We see ads and TV shows and movies that display what roles each gender should play, the girls are carrying the dolls while the boys play with the trucks. Walk through the toy section of any store, you can easily tell what toys are for "boys" and which ones are for "girls".

Women are "supposed" to be the ones to stay at home, in the kitchen, clean, take care of people, etc. they're thought to be not as good at math or science, but rather writing and social skills.  when they're younger they're supposed to play with dolls, wear dresses, etc. None of these things are genetically predisposed - it's what society has decided.|`|0KXiwjDbaa	Well, Chickyboo, things have come a long way.

wxO3eatxaa	sticking your butt in the air? What are you too good for god or somethig? You refuse to get down and bow to him?     And there is a difference between "you can pray anytime of the day you want" and "you must pray 5 times a day" How many christians actually pray any time of the day, seriously? sorry actually how many christians are there that actually go by their religion? cuz i live in a so called "christian" country and I dont see people caring about god anywhere. I see people getting blind drunk on christmas and people being gay, and people sleeping with their best friends wife, people getting pregnant at 16..... i could go on forever. I dont dislike christianity, I like true christians they prove there are still good people in the world.    EDIT: cave dust, whats your point?

The O.T. was completed by 400BC. It prophesied the coming promised Saviour. The NT is the record of this fulfillment by the one we call Jesus Christ. His name should be translated to "the Saviour who was promised" The NT was officially accepted in the 300's AD by the Christians. There was discussion about which books were true. Heresy ones like the false gospel of Judas and others were never accepted. There are 39 in the OT and 27 in the NT. Roman Catholics add some extra to the OT but this was never accepted as scripture. The Bible is an amazing collection of writings from so many authors all fitting together as one complete message. Real christians know this is only possible because it is inspired by God. We don't have originals but the oldest copies are closser to original dates than any other old writings. The dead sea scrolls and other archaeological findings verify what we are reading now is the same as the oldest copies except now it has been translated to most modern languages. There's lots more to it but not here now. nev r|`|rsYvaCk6aa	It depends on how you define "Bible."  Adam wrote the first scriptures, however we don't have them right now.  Moses wrote the first five books we have now.   He also wrote other things that aren't as well known and some things that are completely lost to man at the moment.  The standard Old Testament was compiled by Jewish Elders living in Egypt  around the time of Christ.  The first Christian scriptures were written shortly after Christ's ascension.  The Catholic bible including the apocrypha and the pseudipegrapha was compiled and approved at the Council of Nicea in the Fourth Century.  Before that, there were other collections of books but hone were accepted by the churches as a whole.  During the Protestant reformation, new bibles were produced based on various interpretations and it was standardized during that time to include the 66 books we have now.  However, God is still alive, he still loves his children and he still calls prophets and apostles and reveals his will through them.  The most recent document that can be called scripture is "The Living Christ" which can be read at http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vg...|`|3cqfxNxlaa	The complete bible is roughly 1600 years old.

We do good deeds to build rapport within our community thereby ensuring that others will put enough faith in us to do good for us when we need it.

If you have any other questions, feel free to email me!!!!|`|CGNZGSbYaa	for the God of the people which started this religion is great|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	I'm a Christian and go to a Lutheran church. This is the basic Christian message: God is eternal, holy, perfect, love. God loves us all so much He wants us to be with Him in heaven forever. But, we aren't perfect, for sure. So, God sent us His Son, Jesus Christ, as the model of how we should live our life and as the bridge to God. Jesus died on the cross as the sacrifice for our sins. Now, when we accept Jesus into our life to be a Christian, we receive God's forgiveness and blessing, protection and guidance plus go to heaven to be with God foorever after we die. To accept Jesus into your life, you can say a prayer like this: "Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for my sins. I have done the following sins (state these out) and I pray to discontinue these sins. I pray to receive Jesus Christ into my life as my Lord and Savior forever. In Jesus' name, amen." Praying this prayer will make you a born-again Christian. You could call a few Christian churches near you and see what they are doing. God bless.|`|ccZuEOEfaa	I have done a lot of research, and to be honest I still don't really know which religion I belong to.  What I do know, is that I'm starting to form a set of beliefs that work for me, and I'm trying to implement those beliefs and other aspects of religion and spirituality into my daily life.  The beliefs I've "chosen" are things that when I've read them or heard about them have really... I don't know, "clicked" maybe, somewhere inside me. They just seem to make a lot more sense to me and fit in with my life more than any other beliefs I have heard of.  I identify very strongly with Pagan and Wiccan beliefs, and I usually refer to myself as Neo-Pagan when being asked to name my religion, although technically Neo-Paganism isn't really a religion.

I don't know what region you reside in, but if you happen to live near Dallas or the DFW Metroplex, then you may be interested in the COUPLES-MASSAGE CLASS which is taught at Sterling Health Center Massage School every year.    It is a six (6) hour course on that Saturday from 10am-4pm and by the end of the day, all couples should feel comfortable giving a full-hor massage like a pro and without injuring themselves or getting tired!    Its such a fun class and very popular with the Dallas locals who know!  But if you dont live in Dallas, its still worth the search to find a similar class nearby that teaches couples or pairs (such as mother/daughter, etc) how to give a good massage.     Basically, during half of the class you will be massaging your partner and during the other half, yout parner will be massaging you.  It is a unique gift that everybody loves and you can bet that anyone receiving the gift will never forget it!    For anyone interested in enrolling in the Couples Massage Class in Dallas, they can either logon to http://www.sterlinghealthcenter.com or http://www.sterlingdayspa.com or call the massage school directly at +1(972)991-9292 .    I hope this helps! Good luck and Happy Valentines Day to you in advance!

94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	Throughout history there have been waves of "fashion". Some generations have actually had eras where "the bigger the better" ideas were more popular, and of course some where they needed extra skinny. In less populas countries where American TV was not aired the self esteem was much higher, but... as a trial in this same subject. Sociologist and psychologist brought episodes of Friends and some other television programs to some of these areas. After some time it was documented that those members of those societies had a decreased self esteem and poor body reflections. The diets of these areas reduced drastically and they started treating each other in a discriminating manor. They had gone from perfectly happy to, a constant diet and low self esteem, all from American Media Hype.   So yes I do agree if more models actually looked like the general public, we would be happier as a society.   People actually think the average female is a size 3, because that is what is on the magazines. However, the average American female is a size 14. Even Marilyn Monroe, declared the sexiest woman of all time was a size 14.  People need to shut the magazines and look around.|`|AA12095894	No,because your still ugly.    But look at the bright side-Fat people are hard to kidnap,so you don't have to worry about that.|`|b1b3472d676e9936d78fe0968d48908baa	I dont think that has anything to do with acceptance. I think it's a deeper evolutionary knee-jerk reaction having more to do with the fear that there will be no future generations to provide security and food and resources. Of course, we've evolved societally out of this, but not emotionally. We're still in the same place emotionally. I think there's a connection betwen the unacceptance of fat people and the unacceptance of gay marriage. Men for the most part are not attracted to fat women. If men and women do not make babies, there will be no future, at least that's what he embedded, implanted command is within the human gene. Gays cant produce children themselves and if men dont reproduce with fat women, or if cute attractive women dont find fat men attractive, then theres not going to be any children. I think the whole issue of fat discrimination has everything to do with evolutionary fears than it does open-minded intelligence.|`|69e6207200dbb1d82429c1fa8aa1f6f1aa	nah i dont think that will happen, fat people just look SH*T|`|2948461bc351babded4abfbd847dceecaa	More than likely as we are consumers of what is presented to us.|`|34a6344db516b213323999b48b27aae7aa	being overweight is messy and unsightly.  this has nothing to do with fashion--for example...models are typically stick thin. i have no desire to be stick thin. i like looking healthy/athletic.  to reduce the aversion to obesity to a matter of fashion and trends is to deny the truth and minimize the problem...putting fault where it does not belong. fat people need to start assuming responsibility for thire laziness (EXCEPT for those with medical conditions causing their obesity) and stop trying to find acceptance for their faults.  get on a tread mill.|`|AA11635058	Absolutely|`|6beb13331792fe012affadcf2b32af32aa	Probably, but the fact is, obesity is a disease.|`|9167ee473cf2b91fc03ce5f3a5d5dfd5aa	oh course this world is full of people who can't think for themselves|`|AA11887010	Hypothetically, if being fat was the new "cool" displayed in the mass media, people would accept that as time passes. Eventually, you would go to most mall stores and there would be only plus sizes clothings and bigger mannequins with curves. The research findings would only be reported if they showed the positive of being fat. But, for this to happen, less "thin" people need to be displayed and put people from various sizes to show people the diversity (i.e., skinny, average, slightly overweight, overweight, obese, etc...).

I know high school kids can be tough so i wish you luck, and don't forget that when you get to college things will be SO much better, i promise you that. I wouldn't feel obligated to tell anyone either if you don't want to, it is your personal business and your right to keep it private if you want to.|`|Xef2mbGcaa	Maybe you want to define yourself to other people.  Not good.|`|syIp6d2Naa	Two reasons, you like using it as a shock factor, and your looking for acceptance. Every teen has something they like to use to shock people, look at the goths, the punker's that was so popular. The words of gangsta rap. Shaved heads and lots of chains, tattoos and piercings.. They are all shock factors. The other looking for acceptance, it may be as simple as making sure your parents see the good grade you got, even thought you usually do get good grades. It can be with your peers wanting them to approve of the way you dress or the music you like. Your wanting to tell people is your needing the acceptance they can give if they don't get freaked out, and most, if they are your friend won't have a problem about it, but you still like using that shock factor and your waiting almost holding your breath for that one person that gets really freaked out about it. So it would be a really good idea to think before opening your secret to so many people because if you do happen to tell someone and they do freak, most likely the whole school will know in short order. Do you really want that?|`|AA11264399	You're young and you're excited about your sexuality so you want to share it with others.|`|XfjoDHo2aa	attention or maybe your so happy to come out that all you want to do is let go and let it out...|`|nuCXcLUIaa	You want to be totally out?

If you run into negativity, distance yourself from that and don't allow yourself to be closed minded.|`|n560blqraa	THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING POSTING!  At first when I saw the title of this, I was not sure I wanted to post my opinion. However, upon reading the remainder of your post you bring up several valid points. It is often thought by many people that racism only works one way, i.e. against african americans perpetuated by caucasians. Hence, the irony when we (caucasian's) are discriminated against being referred to as "reversed discrimination". However, racial issues and discrimination is found in all religions, race, sex, etc. If someone is making you personally feel responsible or culpable for what occurred during the time of slavery they are just idiots plain and simple. They are using it as a scape goat instead of getting on with their lives, working, and finding their own success in life. No one can keep you down unless you choose them to do so. Anybody who is seeking reparations from caucasians who personally had nothing to do with slavery is insane. Claiming this is a load of BS,as not all caucasian's ancestors were involved in enslaving. There are many people with caucasian ancestry that did not believe in slave ownership and in fact educated and helped them run putting their own lives at risk. Again, this becomes more of an issue about idiocy than anything else, as they would have no conception of slavery or what there ancestors may or may not have gone through. Just as what our ancestors may or may not have done. Not all african american people feel this way. (atleast those that have common sense and are educated do not). We are finding especially in this day and age that you will hear less of that given our current President Barack Obama takes a lot of the excuses off the table for not being able to do something. Clearly, he became President and overcame adversity. I think racism exists on a multitude of levels, and unfortunately just the mere discussion of this here will make most people feel uncomfortable and some to throw out the race card. It is part of our society and should be talked about openly. If you are finding yourself being descriminated against b.c you are white then be a better man, and turn the other cheek. Choose not to racially inflame situations as then you become those who are setting racial fires. Acknowledge that Ignorance is rampid in whatever form it takes..caucasian, african american, etc. etc.  Until then realize that good people also come in every shape, form, religion, race, sex, as well.  Understand that when are dicriminated against it should also not be deemed as  "Reversed Discrimination" just "Discrimination."|`|7d866ea2a2dff3d3d77ce1b12a4e11c8aa	Wow!    What an observation!    Hate is a strong word!    Get over what happened 170 years ago, it is evident Mathematics is not your favorite subject!    Get a history book & read it!    You appear to be very disgruntled!    Did a Black person step on your foot & didn't say:  " I apologize", or did a Black person move next door to you & in the privacy of your home you said:  "There goes the neighborhood."    Did a Black person pick a fight with you & you thought to yourself:  Will he come back with guns & more of his peeps & kill me?    Better yet, did a black person beat you in a game of B-ball & now you're thinking:  Is he related to LeBron James?    Okay, those are a few scenarios I just presented!    How do you feel now?     It's called generalizing & stereotyping!    I know, you said not all Blacks, right?    Peace.

CCAQWT25aa	Hello again.  :)     Whose introduces the non-restrictive (also called non-defining and non-identifying) relative clause whose daughter is my classmate.  You surely know this is an adjectival clause and that it acts as post modifier of a noun (in the majority of cases). In your sentence, it modifies "man".    Whose daughter is the subject of the relative clause and is my classmate is the predicate. Whose is a pre-modifier of daughter. Im sure you can analyse the predicate yourself.    The word "whose" is a "relative determiner" here. It is clear it can't be a pronoun because it's pre-modifying a noun (and pronouns take the place of nouns). It's the only relative determiner you will find in relative clauses.     Good luck!      C.|`|iaOktaU1aa	"whose" in this case is used as the start of the subordinate clause, "whose daughter is my classmate". It describes the subject "man".

ccZuEOEfaa	Even though I'm going to sound like a grammar nazi (which I am, actually) I think that your spelling and grammatical errors say a lot about the "preparation" that you have supposedly done.  Spells are not something to be taken lightly. You have to mean it, and it should be special and significant to your growth and progress as both a witch and a human being. Something as important as that deserves more care than you have given it here.  Also, you haven't put anything in there about "for the good of all" or "with harm to none". Those are immensely important, especially the "with harm to none" section.  And that said, it's also very concerning that you're drawing your own blood. I understand the thinking behind it, but you've been misinformed. There is no such thing as a "blood witch" - not in that sense, although I believe it can refer to a witch who has a family history of witchcraft.  With all that said, I think it's likely that your spell would not work, or at least would not have the desired effect. Do some more research, and always remember to adhere to the Wiccan Rede: An it harm none, do what ye will.  I liked the "so mote it be" though.  ??|`|bx4H0KqQaa	You could become a witch/wizard.... if that was possible|`|gNUQ0CDtaa	No i'm not crazy

All social animals must develop an instinctive desire to be fair to others of their kind, or they will not form a society.

Human rights, Civil rights, Animals rights - what does it all really mean?? To be honest, Im not really sure myself...    Do we have the right to exist? I suppose that EVERY living creature has the "right" to the life they were "given" (I hate those terms, because they assume that to be given something, there must be a giver...thats not what Im saying!)     I believe that all life on earth has equal footing. So, yes, I believe we have the 'right' to exist - but I also feel that bears have the 'right' to consume humans that venture into their habitat, and I feel the same way about sharks and other predators...because they have just as much 'right' to survive as humans do.    Beyond that, I do not think that your example is a "classic" response from atheists...more like a rare response.|`|mmDNVqzraa	It has not been my personal experience that atheist's have a "classic" response to Christians as we tend to be a more diverse crowd than most religious people, but I think you hit on something when you said that the response was from a "Christian, who is spreading his beliefs". I certainly understand some one saying , "back off" to someone spreading ANY belief system that someone finds distasteful. I don't know if "right" is the proper word to describe any belief system, but the right to exist can be taken away by the state (death penalty) or a random murderer for that matter, but your beliefs are yours and can't be taken away because they exist in your mind, however, the "right" to openly state your beliefs can be infringed in some countries that don't allow the open expression of such beliefs. If you are disappointed in this answer, don't feel bad, I'm not really impressed with it either.
QmRYgGnDaa	God created it   Genesis 1     1In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.        2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.        3And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.        4And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.        5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.        6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.        7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.        8And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.        9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.        10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.        11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.        12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.        13And the evening and the morning were the third day.        14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:        15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.        16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.        17And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,        18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.        19And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.        20And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.        21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.        22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.        23And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.        24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.        25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.        26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.        27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.        28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.        29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.        30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.        31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.

Much like History.. Organized religion acts as a religious database of what to do and what NOT to do.     You can lace this concept in just about every answer.     This extends to scriptural interpretation, deciding morals and ethical issues, etc.     We don't have to re-invent the wheel each generation, we can draw upon the knowledge of the past and build upon it, internalize it, draw Straight and resolve from it.     It makes us feel part of a bigger community.  Think about if you drew upon the collective knowledge of an organized religion the next time someone challenges your views or interpretation on something.  You will likely feel much stronger in your conviction IF you believe that this has always been the view of my religion, going back ____ years. It's not just ME who believes this but ALL the previous generations, so I'm not the only one who thinks like that.     Lastly you can use your organized religion as a "consistency check" to make sure your OWN views aren't going askew.  Like a mirror you hold up to yourself, your own actions, etc. and make sure you aren't rationalizing bad behavior.  Without organized religion, it is too easy for individuals to rationalize their own behavior.     So organized religion gives you solidarity, acts as a base of knowledge, and is a consistency check to keep you on track.|`|atfKCzmPaa	Fellowship, brotherhood, and solidarity have long been cherished by religious believers.

In order for something to be a mortal sin, three conditions must exist:    1) the sin must indeed be gravely serious.  2) the person must know that it is grave.  3) the person must fully intend to commit the sin.    Mental illness generally rules out  3, making a mortal sin unlikely.    In any case, leave judgment up to God. He's the only one who can do it.

In 40 years, nope, still not wearing them. In 60 years, you'll be lucky if half of your senior class isn't wearing diapers.

Alot !|`|AA12006309	Let me just take a moment to point out to you that the "new punk" movement right now wouldn't know real punk if they got their teeth kicked in by one.    Punk is about rejecting conformity, fighting the system, railing against the establishment, not whining about the girls at school, crying about not being able to board on public sidewalks, or any of that other crap.  It's not about skinny jeans and buying your clothes at the mall.     Classic punks pulled their clothes out of dumpsters and goodwill bins, and customized them themselves.  It was about making something from nothing.  Now it's just a bunch of overprivilged whiners who've probably never heard the Dead Kennedys or Rollins/Black Flag. Sheesh.|`|QRG2L5Qjaa	Tons.

If this is an adult I am typing to then I have no idea.|`|zc47c39daa	The details of your question don't really specify proof if you're becoming a vampire or therian. First of all, you can bite yourself all you want, and bruise yourself without it hurting, because some spots of your body don't have many nerve endings. Such as your finger tips near the nail; I've bitten there until it's bled because of my horrible habit of biting my nails / the skin near my nails. And I would stop bruising yourself before someone thinks you're hurting yourself / getting abused. -pun intended ;)-    Second of all, a poor circulation can lead yourself to feel cold constantly, along with being very skinny and having little body fat. Even if you are healthy and exercise, sometimes you can just naturally have a poor circulation.    For feeling like you want people to die, that doesn't really mean anything. I'd suggest seeing a therapist about this though, because it's not normal.. But then again you say you don't mean it, well you actually do or you're lying to yourself to try and act like a vampire/therian. Your mind plays powerful tricks on you often, even if you don't realize it.    Not wanting to be with anyone or befriend anyone is normal. I naturally like to be by myself, but I'm a very good people person. I don't make friends often and don't really care too. I like to be alone and away from society. It's normal.    Honestly I don't believe the eye color thing, but it could be the result of your clothing, the intensity of lighting, etc. Your eyecolor is probably normally hazel, with a bit of blue. You're just otherwise tricking yourself into thinking you're 'changing' when in fact none of these really represent changing into a therian/vampire.    Now I feel like you've been reading too much twilight because no where does it say vampires are extremely cold / graceful. Okay? People need to get this through their heads. No such thing as twilight vampires. -_- They are made up.     People sometimes naturally become well-balanced with age. Some grow out of it, it's nothing big.    But you do sound like you have symtoms of depression and I'd advise seeing your doctor and getting a check up.     I'm not trying to be rude, but too many teenagers think they are becoming vampires / therians through stupid means. I just think it's one of those 'I want to be one of these so bad, I'm tricking myself subconsciously so I can think I'm turning into one when the things I'm saying really have nothing to do with it.'    Go see a doctor and talk about maybe getting a therapist.|`|kZThAvSKaa	If you begin pronouncing the "w" sound like the "v" sound and your hair turns black and greasy with a widow's peak, then yes, you are definitely a vampire, a vampire who should seek therapy IMMEDIATELY.

Jesus made this sacrament because no one is perfect, Jesus told St. Peter all the sins you forgive on earth will be forgiven in heaven.

Although I came to Jesus at the age of 12, my "spirit" just wasn't in it.  I have been a faithful believer the last 20 years and it has brought more joy to my life than I ever imagined it could.    Do it because it is what you want to do and not something you feel pressured into doing.  If you are attending Sunday services at a church then tell the Pastor of your intent to rededicate your life.      Remember that when you surrender your will to God He can and will move you in ways and use you in ways you never thought possible.  Listen.  He will talk to you and you will understand.    God Bless You.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	Don't be so worried about messing up, it's normal, it's how we learn.

I speak from my own experience, do I sound upset?  Yes.  :)    I'm tired of religious folks ruining it for everyone with their "rules, regulations and conditions."  They impose their own conditions on an unconditional God.    Be Yourself in God, religion isn't necessary unless you want to fellowship.

I apologize if I offend you in any way because this is not my intentions.  I do realize what you are speaking of however, I feel you may be mistaken in your thinking.  Once you give your life to Jesus Christ it is His forever.  There is nothing to rededicate.  We all stray from Christ sometimes.  I think one of two things is going on with you.  One, you are a genuine believer of Christ, child of God the Father and you have just strayed away from the path of righteous living, that is the correct life Jesus wants you to live and you just need to ask God to forgive you and get back on the straight and narrow road of righteous living for Jesus Christ.  Two you may have been fooled by an incorrect message of "decision-ism" and made a decision to follow Jesus Christ or as we say ''Be Saved" and never truly put on Christ and became that new creation.  Maybe you never truly lived the life Christ wanted you to live because you were not truly His child.  Whatever it is I pray that you get back in touch with Jesus Christ.  If you are a child of God then just ask God to forgive you and renew your obedience to Him.  If it may be you never truly became a Child of God then today is the day.  Now is the time of salvation.  I will keep you in my prayers.    Grace of God in Jesus Christ be to you.  You may email me if you need advice.|`|atfKCzmPaa	Wisely Exercising God-Given Freedom  God created humans to treasure freedom. He granted them the capacity of free will. The first human couple made use of their freedom of choice. However, they unwisely and unlovingly made a choice that led to disaster both for them and for their offspring. Still, this clearly demonstrates that Jehovah never forces intelligent creatures to take a course contrary to their inner motives or desires. And since God loves a cheerful giver, the only dedication acceptable to him is one based on love, one made willingly with cheerfulness, one founded on freedom of choice. (2?Corinthians 9:7) Any other kind is unacceptable.  In full recognition of this requirement, Jehovahs Witnesses advocate the dedicating of oneself to God, but they never coerce anyone into making such a dedication, not even their own children. In contrast with many churches, the Witnesses do not baptize their offspring as infants, as if it were possible to force them into dedication without the benefit of personal choice. The Scriptural pattern to follow is the one followed by the young man Timothy. As an adult, he was told by the apostle Paul: Continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, knowing from what persons you learned them and that from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.2?Timothy 3:14, 15.  It is noteworthy that Timothy knew the holy writings because he had been taught them from infancy. He had been persuadednot forcedto believe Christian teachings by his mother and grandmother. (2?Timothy 1:5) As a result, Timothy saw the wisdom of becoming a follower of Christ and thus made the personal choice of Christian dedication. In modern times, tens of thousands of young men and women whose parents are Jehovahs Witnesses have followed this example. (Psalm 110:3) Others have not. It is a matter of personal choice.  Choosing to Be a?Slave of Whom?--No human is totally free. Everyone is restricted in his freedom by physical laws, such as the law of gravity, which cannot be ignored with impunity. Also in a spiritual sense, no one is totally free. Paul reasoned: Do you not know that if you keep presenting yourselves to anyone as slaves to obey him, you are slaves of him because you obey him, either of sin with death in view or of obedience with righteousness in view?Romans 6:16.  The idea of being someones slave strikes most people as unpleasant. Yet, in todays world the reality is that people often let themselves be manipulated and influenced in so many subtle ways that they end up involuntarily doing what others want them to do. For instance, the advertising industry and the entertainment world endeavor to press people into a mold, establishing standards for them to follow. Political and religious organizations get people to support their ideas and goals, not always by means of convincing arguments, but often by appealing to a sense of solidarity or loyalty. Since Paul noted that we are the slaves of those whom we obey, each of us does well to ask himself, Of whom am I a slave? Who exercises the greatest influence on my decisions and my way of life? Do religious clergymen, political leaders, financial tycoons, or entertainment personalities? Whom do I obeyGod or men? Christians do not view obedience to God as an unwarranted infringement upon personal freedom. They willingly exercise their freedom in the manner of their Exemplar, Jesus Christ, bringing personal desires and priorities into line with Gods will. (John 5:30; 6:38) They develop the mind of Christ, submitting themselves to him as Head of the congregation. (1?Corinthians 2:14-16; Colossians 1:15-18) This is much like a woman who marries and willingly cooperates with the man she loves. In fact, the body of anointed Christians is spoken of as a chaste virgin promised to the Christ in marriage.2?Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 5:23, 24; Revelation 19:7,?8.  Bible truth frees people from believing false religious doctrines, such as eternal torment in a fiery hell. (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10) Instead, it fills their hearts with gratitude for the true hope for the deadthe resurrection made possible on the basis of Jesus Christs ransom sacrifice. (Matthew 20:28; Acts 24:15; Romans 6:23) Bible truth frees people from the frustrations of relying on political promises that consistently fall short. Instead, it causes their hearts to overflow with joy at knowing that Jehovahs Kingdom already rules in the heavens and will shortly rule over the entire earth. Bible truth frees people from practices that, although appealing to the fallen flesh, dishonor God and exact a heavy toll in the form of failed relationships, sickness, and premature death. In short, being a slave of God is exceedingly more beneficial than being a slave of men. In fact, dedication to God promises benefits in this period of time .?.?. and in the coming syst|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	Yes, you can re-commit.

And you cannot be saved by "making a commitment to Christ".     NOBODY will be saved that way.      STOP TRYING TO EARN SALVATION!!!  You can't earn salvation!  None of us will EVER be good enough to earn salvation.     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)

I think it's Scottish for some reason and it doesn't seem to be male or female based on its actions so far which is why it has a rather unisex name.|`|oSig1lQoaa	Its not stupid all my cars have been called Nellie|`|o7r9w4Wbaa	its only cool it its a sh*T heap if its in good nick than its stupid    old knacked cars have history and therefore need a name so you can shout encouragement at them when going up a big hill and your not sure if you can make it up,lol|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	i always name my cars.     my first car was a peugeot 106 and i called her mildred.    my most recent car is a black ka and i called it alan (as in alan carr!)|`|AA10561400	Stupid|`|0l98mcf3aa	I don't think it's stupid.

There are also those who don't understand that Africa is a continent and not a country, big difference.     Another stereotype that I know of is that people in Africa don't like to work. It stems from westerners that's used to work all day and rest at night while people in Africa have the sense to stay out of the sun in the middle of the day and work when it's less hot outside.

It's impossible to generalized and make a statement that applies to all.     The basic idea was actually that god made man and woman in such a way that they can and should create new life. If god hadn't wanted humans to breed then he would have created two men or two women.     That basic thing has of course been twisted and turned a couple or rounds around the globe by now and other variations and ideas has emerged from the tangled mess that it's made on the way.

I believe everyone is entitled to one mistake but I also believe the government should provide only for that one mistake.

IQ can change many times in a lifetime, and it can be raised and lowered arbitrarily, as well.       For instance drug use lowers it.  Education raises it.

Unfortunately this and many other things in this crappy world will never happen. My heart breaks everyday I read or hear the news regarding all the horrible things parents/caregivers do to their children as if they are their own personal punching bags. The child porn rings, the child welfare system, the cults that claim it's for God, physical, sexual, and mental abuse. If you want to have children you have to commit to a responsibility that is continual and to be able to provide for them emotionally, physically,  and financially. The only end to this miserable existence is death.

His Cosmos (1980) is one of the most popular science books ever written, planting itself on the New York Times bestseller list for 70 weeks and staying perpetually in print ever since. It was a companion for the PBS television series of the same name, which t along with numerous Tonight Show appearance t introduced Sagan and his emphatically stated phrase "billions and billions" into pop culture. His sole novel, Contact, was turned into a love-it-or-hate-it movie starring Jodie Foster as an erstwhile scientist searching for extraterrestrial life, with Matthew McConaughey as a New Age flake who, inevitably, makes his own form of contact with her.    Besides his pop-culture credentials, Sagan was pals with numerous legendary Nobel Prizewinners while still in college, picked up a Pulitzer Prize for his book Dragons of Eden, and consulted for NASA, MIT, Cornell and RAND. He designed the human race's postcards to any aliens that might be out there t the plaque onboard the Pioneer space probes and the record on the Voyager probes.    So it might come as a bit of a surprise that Sagan was an avid smoker of marijuana. Some might even call him a pothead.    In his definitive biography of the celebrity scientist, Keay Davidson reveals that Sagan started smoking regularly in the 1960s and that Dragons of Eden -- which won the Pulitzer -- "was obviously written under the inspiration of marijuana." Davidson says of Sagan:    He believed the drug enhanced his creativity and insights. His closest friend of three decades, Harvard psychiatry professor Dr. Lester Grinspoon, a leading advocate of the decriminalization of marijuana, recalls an incident in the 1980s when one of his California admirers mailed him, unsolicited, some unusually high-quality pot. Grinspoon shared the joints with Sagan and his wife, Anne Druyan. Afterward, Sagan said, "Lester, I know you've only got one left, but could I have it? I've got serious work to do tomorrow and I could really use it."|`|J05WTQwPaa	Jack Nicholson|`|j3Ghth65aa	after about 10-20 years if someone else asks this again everyone will say my name because i smoke weed and i have great potential for the world|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.

Yc5s32a5aa	hi!!!!!!  Im an Irish teenager, so I have all the info. To be honest, we are just the same as American teenagers...i think. We start secondary school when we are 13 and stay there for 5/6 years. Its hard work sometimes but i guess that's the same everywhere. Our schools are a lot smaller. In my school, there are 600 students. We have to do two state exams, the junior certificate and the leaving certificate which you take before college or uni. We love sports and other pastimes too. In my school, basketball and gaelic (irish footie) are really popular. Lots of my friends play different instruments and do dancing and stuff like that too. We love our music! we listen to American, British and Irish artists. Lady Gaga is really big over here at the moment. When we hang out with friends, we do stuff like go to the cinema or go shopping and stuff. we can't do much stuff outdoors because it gets rainy here sometimes. Discos are really popular here too. Unfortunately, drinking and smoking is a problem amongst irish teens, but not everyone is into it!!!! Family is very important to us but most irish teens spend more time with friends than family. Loads of irish girls have boyfriends too. Here is an important grammar lesson!!! make out=score or meet(in ireland). We love a good laugh.Irish people are very friendly so I hope you enjoy your stay here. It's a wonderful country to live in. If you would like to know anything else, please email me at xxooxx@hotmail.com
EHozsofQaa	The first form of each verb is the future of the indicative (=futur de l'indicatif) while the second form is the present of the conditional (=present du conditionel). In principle, there's a minor difference in the pronounciation of the two forms ("irais" would be pronounced "" while "irai" would be prounounced "", but in Paris, where I grew up, both forms are pronounced "", so we don't make any difference.    Examples of use of both forms:   Quand j'aurai 6-7 ans, je perdrai mes dents de lait.  Si j'avais deja 6-7 ans, je perdrais mes dents de lait.    Quand je serai grand, je serai docteur.  Si j'etais grand, je serais docteur.    En apres-midi, j'irai faire des courses.  Si on etait deja en apres-midi, j'irais faire des courses.
Du0IjrUdaa	it depends on the context the person uses it in.  like, some people like "weird" people, and "weird" to them is different, unique and creative. in other words, "weird" to them is COOL.  for others, it can be a negative thing because some things just aren't socially accepted.     just be yourself|`|E1d9MVKWaa	I would say the word weirdo does have a bad rep. I mean I know people who will say it as a joke, like flirty or something, but usually it's referring to someone who is weird/out-of place. why do we insist on the name calling???|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	That depends on the individual's opinion of 'beind weird.'  Both my husband and I are very proud of being weird, and we call each other weird or weirdo all the time.  When someone else calls us weird or weirdo (usually in an attempt to put one of us or both of us down) we give them a big smile and say 'Thanks, we try to be weird and it's nice of you to notice.'  That definitely shuts them up ... and they are more careful around others the next time they think 'putting a person down' is a good thing.  It's not a good thing ... but the best way to 'fight' this is not to argue, but to be very friendly, agree, and thank them for noticing.  They never seem to know what to do after that ... usually for quite a while!|`|IppmajNVaa	Id say it depends on how its used..like if it was by a lover who said your such a weirdo! it would be positive Connotation ..if it was a guy off the street who said..your such an Effing Weirdo! ..its probably negative.|`|hQLtxiseaa	good :) there is nothing wrong with being different.

BUT if you are weird there's nothing u can do about it ... weirdo|`|MaDN2SYEaa	Being a weirdo generally has a bad connotation. Unless your friends called you that and you know they were joking.

(my translate)    While I was talking and looking at you,   the time stopped in an instant:   love was calling me me and I obeyed.   While i was whispering and loving you,   the feelings rose up  your voice ruled,   the sky was visible in your eyes,   and i spoke the ''want'' on your lips.

Actually I am not against the queen but it had nothing what so ever to do with the queen as it was made clear on the News that she is not responsible in any way as to what is bought to sell in her shop. However, apart from that I think once again it is PC gone mad.  There are lots of white clown dolls around and are there any complaints of racism? As a child I loved my gollywog and if anything it endeared black people to me. My dad is 90 yr old, very charitable and for years he has sponsored many children from Africa and other countries. At Christmas and birthdays he now tells all the family not to buy for him but if they feel they want to do something for him to give a donation to one of his charities. At his age PC just doesn't come in to it.  He refers almost everyday to 'the wee black children' and feels so genuinely for them. This is said in the most loving of ways and certainly not offensive.  I am sure people from all nations in the world don't really mind their names shortened or nicknames if it is meant in a nice way.  The world has really gone crazy. You don't think so? Right now all you Irish people on here start claiming it is racism for you to be called Paddy', Scots do the same if called Jocks, Welsh if you are a taffy, Same with those from US if called Yanks. C'mon what is the difference from abbreviating those from China or Pakistan etc when it is meant in the same friendly sense? Have you ever head of the Scots, Irish, US, Welsh etc etc etc making a racisim complaint? I rest my case.|`|dOQA34a3aa	it is hardly racism. just people being a little oversensitive!

IKrg7vKdaa	I want to talk to you^__^ I can try to teach you some italian...and you can help me to improve my english^__^    Have you got msn? My account is Nightshade89@hotmail.it|`|9k7IxtRMaa	I' m Italian and I speak English fluently. What you must know is that Italian is a really tough language to learn. Even though it is pronounced as it is written, the Italian grammar is way more difficult than the English one. Many Italians make mistakes when it comes to using some specific tenses (especially the "congiuntivo"., that could be translated as "subjunctive" even though it' s use is completely different and way more difficult than in English). So be careful; do not underestimate the complexity of Leopardi' s and Pirandello' s language. Bye.    P.S. Ragazzotto, sbagli; l' italiano si pronuncia come si legge, sicuramente pi dell' inglese o del francese; tutti gli esempi che hai fatto dimostrano che stai dicendo una cosa errata; il fatto che a te la pronuncia di queste parole sembri diversa da come sono scritte  dovuta al fatto che parli (suppongo) bene solo l' italiano. Se tu conoscessi altrettanto bene l' inglese (e non  cos, si capisce dai vari errori che hai commesso in cos poche frasi) capiresti ci che voglio dire; "enough", ad esempio, si pronuncia (anche se la trasposizione del suono in italiano non rende bene) "inaff". Dunque, anche se l' italiano non  sempre pronunciato cos come  scritto, nella stragrande maggioranza dei casi lo . Consolati, abbiamo ancora una delle grammatiche pi complicate che ci siano; il congiuntivo  un' incognita per gli italiani come per gli stranieri.|`|53DPNQhdaa	contrary to what emiliano said, italian is NOT ALWAYS pronounced as sounded.    like 'chi' or 'che' is (kee) (keh).    ci: chee, ce: cheh    qui: kwee, qua: kwah    gui: gwee, gue: gweh    ghi: gee (hard G), ghe: geh (like Get or Spaghetti)    gna: nyah, gne: nyeh    gli: lyee  (hard for a beginner to pronunce!!)

There are many non Hebrew people throughout the world that have converted to Judaism. Look at Whoopi Goldberg who is a an American with no Hebrew ties whatsoever.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	Hey there!    First, let me start out by stating that Judaism is a religion (not a race like some people try to claim), and while we do not believe in proselytizing, we do welcome converts with open arms (If you are already Jewish there is no need to convert). You should be aware that the process is not easy, like in some other theological beliefs however.    The reason for this is because Judaism maintains that people should have a good thorough understanding of their belief, before deciding whether or not they should get involved.  We try to discourage spontaneity because sometimes people make decisions they regret later.     With that said, you will probably want to do some research about the religion, and then speak with a local Rabbi in your area to answer any questions you may have.     Here are some resources for you:|`|hceNM6Uxaa	No, it's not necessary to be Jewish.  In fact, if one is Jewish according to Jewish halacha (law) it's not necessary to convert, one can just start being Jewish again.  If you're not Jewish, you can convert.  To do so is quite demanding - first, you find a rabbi who is willing to accept you as a proselyte, and then you study and study and study - history, Torah, festivals, Jewish life, Hebrew - and attend the synagogue for an absolute minimum of a year so that you have experienced all the festivals including shabbat itself.  Then you go before a rabbinic court and have an interview where the rabbis will try to find out if you are ready, truly prepared.  If so, you are invited to go to the mikveh (ritual bath) and are then declared Jewish.
bb06GQ5Paa	I think you've written a good essay however your reasoning for the use of cell phones doesn't make much sense.  For example, you cite safety as a concern in schools because of September 11th.  Land lines still exist, you know.  There are telephones all over a school and they are more reliable than cell phones.  If you need to reach your parents, there is no reason you can't.  And in the event something outrageous does happen, if your cell phone is in your locker, go to your locker and use it.

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Christ said that by "Your fruits, he shall know you."    How can just stating a belief be sufficient?   With behavior, actions, and efforts is how we demonstrate our faith and beliefs.         The Savior asks us what good is our faith if we do not do anything about it.   THe poor do not get fed, the sick do not get comforted, the naked do not get clothed just because we say we have faith.  We have to "DO" something, and that is showing our faith.    That is where the organization of Christ's church comes in.  That organization helps us accomplish providing service to others.  Christ organized a church while he was on the earth.  The Bible states that he called prophets, apostles, teachers, evangelists, etc.    See Ephesians 4:11-12  And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;   For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:|`|yp8y1jrCaa	No.    Some religions may have traditions, but attending church should not be mandatory.    Spending time with "God" should be something you want to do rather than be forced to do.     I believe you can spend time with him no matter where you are - not just in church.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	No.  Your heart is actually the only True church.  God cannot be contained by religion.|`|mXfLIk3Aaa	It depends what religion, with Christianity you don't have to go to Church, but you could go down the wrong path if you don't.|`|UTH4q0l2aa	No.  You can go for the music or to meet someone, or if you're interested in the religion or something.    That's like someone saying I'm an Alien just because I was on a spaceship. =] It only means I'm interested in the aliens, not that I want to be one. :D|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	No, you can be a Christian without going to church. But, church helps you grow in your faith. I go where they do a rock and roll service (contemporary service). To be a born-again Christian, we need to accept Jesus into our life as Lord and Savior forever. To accept Jesus into your life, you can say a prayer like this: "Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for my sins. I have done the following sins (state these out) and I pray to discontinue these sins. I pray to receive Jesus Christ into my life as my Lord and Savior forever. In Jesus' name, amen." Praying this prayer will make you a born-again Christian. God bless.|`|3YzXWHwbaa	Simple answer---no.

4INE794zaa	At a formal dinner, soup should be served from an Urn on the table. Semi-formal, it is perfectly acceptable to serve it from the kitchen.|`|TPVvddHWaa	Both are fine.    Now then it is the type of soup dish, bowl which is important here.     The problem with soup dishes is that the soup moves and so the dish/bowl has a mark on it which shows where the soup has slopped.    So, the important thing is that the soup should not show signs of movement if it is served in the bowl.

Over all, it was not nearly as nasty as I has imagined.  The staff seemed nice enough and everything was clean; the music was good.  However, the point was still pretty clear - basic, quasi-anonymous sex.    Not my scene... but it must work for a lot of people!  For me, it doesn't even rank as one of those "glad I went and saw it" kind of nights.    You can dress up a sow's ear... but it's still not a silk purse.

When I just want to hang out and have fun, it's "iffy" with gay men.  It takes a certain amount of time, and a little something else that I don't know what it is before you're both really comfortable around each other that neither one of you is "interested" in the other one.  And from there, you can relax and have fun.  I stop having to worry about that with girls the second I'm out to them.

6u1B7RQRaa	It's not a matter of psychology - its a matter of a fallen sinful nature.  Once we are saved we are supposed to be free of that nature but we still have the "bent" or habit of our carnal side.  We are "weak, lustful, greedy or lack faith" because we have not strengthened our relationship to our Conquering Lord through prayer, study of the word and worship.  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word.  So without scripture, faith is weak.  Lust of the flesh, lust of the eye and the pride of life are the basic categories of "weakness" or sin.  The dog that gets fed is the strongest of the pack.  If we "feed" our carnal nature our spirit man weakens, if we feed our spirit man our carnal nature weakens.|`|57e1885bdade83593ff264411c902959aa	The Devil gets far to much credit for our actions.

You are the psycologiacal reason why we work against the devil.|`|20cb53b09bc2d2b8277e9c1303274f5caa	Well...We believe that Satan (the Devil)is always "on the prowl" and is causing people to do bad things. Now according to what you're telling me those weak in faith (don't really care about their religion) fall for it, because they don't have much faith. That makes sense considering the fact that if you didn't believe something you wouldn't be strong in that subject either. in order to defeat the devil you must be strong in faith and believe in the Lord almighty. Does this information answer your question?|`|431ecdecabd5546f40df0864584aee49aa	Peace be with you. Jesus said, you can not serve God and mammon. We teach our children to worship mammon.

28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	As pointed out above, it was called GRID, or Gay Related Immune Deficiency. The acronym ARDS, which isn't used much any more, stands for AIDS Related Disease Syndrome.   No one dies from AIDS, rather from opportunistic infections due to the body's immune deficiency. Kaposi's Sarcoma, and Pneumocystis are examples, because they don't affect people with healthy immune systems.   The first reported cause was infection with HTLV-3, a virus similar to the virus that causes leukemia in animals (primarily cats), which turned out to be incorrect; it was put forward by an American immunologist trying to get credit for "discovering" the cause. It was actually the French who discovered it was a retrovirus, and they named it Human Immune Virus, or HIV.  A little sidebar to that dark time: Ronald Reagan didn't even mention AIDS until 1987, six years after it had been discovered. Even after his friend Rock Hudson died from it, he never mentioned it; my guess is he was under too much pressure from the religious community, which was populated by people like that beauty LuLu up there.|`|AA10819547	They also briefly equated it with the Herpes family of viruses and it was known as HTLV-III (although I can't quite remember what the HTLV stands for)|`|AA10612251	It was known as 'GRID' or "Gay-Related Immune Deficiency" (The things you retain from Health class...I'll never understand...)|`|3a72219446c9a5a85bf1448f6d4a2860aa	GRID was the term.

Anyhow in order to be considered sexual harassment it has to be proven that it is an on going issue. Like way more than just once or twice even.   So i suggest you start keeping a journal, keep track of the date, day, time and what happened. For instance you would write down for your first  thing in your journal that he asked you to kiss him.  Write then how you  answered him. Then describe his response or if there was any responsce, just write what you precieved if no words were exchanged in the responses.   Then document how you felt at that time. Continue to document how it  effects you during your work day, how it effected you during time off, and how long this all effected you.  Keep it personal and do not show anyone. If it looks like he is going to continue to pursue you, and it was not a joke, but a jesture, well keep records.   If it is on going, and he does not fire you for not accepting his advances, you may find he had sexually harassed others. I would wait and be sure it is sexual harassment before i started asking around the office. Good Luck|`|7f0f104005330bfe8658c5b62b84b225aa	Report him to your human resources office.|`|287676ba8794faf30c93bf7fd6ba9c0faa	That is sexual harassment and you should not have to tolerate it.

Not the the women are animals, but the truth be it that men are pigs and genetically disposed to do or say almost anything in order to get a lady to say yes to sex.

If she doesn't want you, nothing can make her stay.   Stop making excuses for a woman and her behavior.    Allow your intuition (or spirit) to save you from heartache.   Stop trying to change yourselves for a relationship that's not meant to be.   Slower is better.   Never live your life for a woman before you find what makes you truly happy.   If a relationship ends because the woman was not treating you as you deserve   Then heck no, you can't "be friends."  A friend wouldn't mistreat a friend.   Don't settle. If you feel like he is stringing you along, then she probably is.   Don't stay because you think "it will get better." You'll be mad at yourself   a year later for staying when things are not better.   The only person you can control in a relationship is you.   Always have your own set of friends separate from hers.   Maintain boundaries in how a woman treats you.   If something bothers you, speak up.   Never let a woman know everything.  She will use it against you later.   You cannot change a woman's behavior.  Change comes from within.   Don't EVER make her feel she is more important than you are...even if she has   more education or in a better job. Do not make her into a quasi-god.   ! She is a woman, nothing more nothing less.   Never let a woman define who you are.   Never borrow someone else's woman.   Oh Lord!  If s he cheated with you, she'll cheat on you.   A woman will only treat you the way you ALLOW her to treat you.   All women are NOT dogs.  You should not be the one doing all the bending...compromise is a two-way street.   You need time to heal between relationships...there is nothing cute about   Baggage... deal with your issues before pursuing a new relationship.   You should never look for someone to COMPLETE you...a relationship consists   of two WHOLE individuals...look for someone complimentary...not supplementary.   Dating is fun...even if she doesn't turn out to be Mrs. Right.   Make her miss you sometimes...when a woman always know where you are, and your always readily available to her- she takes it for granted.   Don't fully commit to a woman who doesn't give you everything that you need.   Keep her in your radar but get to know others.   Share this with other ladies.....

Authentic Hadith called as 'Sahih' is the next in authority to Quran.  There are catagories of the Hadith and a Hadith is evaluated upon its chain of narrators, character of the narrators etc.    Hadith is very important in understanding the Quran. Almighty GOD sent down the last and final revelation 'The Quran' which guides mankind towards Monotheism in a brief but understandable manner.    The Hadith will throw more light onto the meanings and commentary of the Quran as explained by the Prophet.     For example, it is ordered in the Quran to establish Daily Prayers. But how many? And what about its structure? These details are derived from the Prophetic traditions. Similarly the 'Zakath'. It is ordered to pay the yearly charity, but the measure and the details are from the Hadith.    NOTE: ALLAH tells in the Quran "...  whatever the Prophet (PBUH) says, is NOT from his heart, instead its a revaltion sent by GOD for mankind..."

Cosas diferentes:     1. El ser creyente no significa que te desconectes del mundo y sus avances tecnolgicos; dice el dicho, informacin es poder, y el poder lo tienes que ocupar para beneficios de la gente.     Como creyente de Dios, s que l nos brindo de dones, entre ellos el don de la sabidura y la tenemos que ocupara para vivir un mejor mundo, por supuesto, hay gente que hace mal uso de lo que tiene.    Por otro lado, Dios, no dijo que tenas que pasar hambre y sufrimiento e incomodidades, en cambio, s, hacer sacrificios personales (ayunos, abstenerse de ciertos gustos, ayudar a otros desprendindote de cosas que te gustan, o de tiempo que ocuparas en alguna diversin, etc.) Dios no es tristeza es alegra.     2. Estoy de acuerdo con los lujos, que a mi parecer, son excesivos para ciertas cosas, Jesucristo nunca tuvo una escolta ni aposentos de gran lujo, ni anillos de oro; pero esto es algo que a mi no me toca juzgar y otro si sern juzgados.     Es complicado, creo el papa Juan Pablo II vivi rodeado de comodidades y sin embargo fue un papa que dedico su vida a predicar la palabra de Dios en muchos pueblos.    Habr gente tanto pobre como rica que alcanzar la salvacin y otro tanto de gente, tanto pobre como rica, que ser juzgada. As mismo habr gente de otras religiones o ateas que slo piensan en el beneficio propio no importando el da?o al prjimo y otras que a pesar de la religin que tengan y lo ateas que sean alcanzarn la gloria (segn su religin), o simple y sencillamente, si eres ateo, morir en paz y con la conciencia tranquila. No es el nombre de tu religin, sino como eres con tu prjimo, familia, amigos, pareja, conocidos y desconocidos.     3. Por supuesto que te doy las gracias por hacerme reflexionar si estoy haciendo lo suficiente o lo correcto.     Saludos.|`|60032f46cae09127e9349ee82dfd9b66aa	mira, la pobreza sabes de donde viene?viene de la poca alimentacion, si en serio, esto seria algo asi...una mujer pobre conoce a un hombre pobre y se ponen a tener hijos por que los dos son totalmente ignorantes de como hacer para no tener tantos hijos, por que ovbiamente nadie se lo explico y si lo hicieron,no entendieron del todo como era la cosa, y despues no los pueden mantener por que claro ninguno tiene trabajo por que se criaron en un mundo que no les dio bola por que ni losmismos padres le dieron bola nunca,y si comian bien y si no aguantate el hambre y por supuesto que para que corno van a ir a la escuela si no tienen ni para comprar un lapiz y aunque le dieran los utiles, con el hambre que tienen encima, te imaginas que no se van a poner a pensar en cuanto es dos mas dos, se estan imaginando un pollo asado o algo por el estilo, con hambre no se puede aprender, eso es sabido, aparte porq ue no te desarrollas lo suficiente y por ende el cerebro no te da para mucho, entonces los chiquitos estos se crian en la calle como sus padres, sin ningun tipo de buen ejemplo a seguir, y viendo todo el dia como se roba como se pega como se aspiraetc, y lo unico que hacen es aprender todo eso y pedir limosna, y asi sigue el circulo, ellos crecen y van a hacer lo mismisimoque hicieron sus padres...que otro ejemplo han tenido? para mi la solucion a la pobreza es alimentar a todos los chicos, pero agarrarlos desde bebes, osea que aun sean  inconcientes de todo lo que hable al principio, y criarlos con todos los buenos ejemplos que haya, mandarlos a la escuela, que se conviertan en personas con razonamiento, con poder de decision, etc de esa forma es como despues se consigue trabajo, y de esa forma es como se va para adelante, entonces los hijos que tengan estos chiquitos ya tendran futuro, y se habra cortado el circulo de la pobreza, te preguntaras por que nose les da trabajo digno a los pobres o una casa para vivir o que el estado les provea de un salario, como aca en argentina se los das a los jefes de flia, etc, sabes que ....en casi el 90% de los casos no sirve, y sabes por que? porque estas personas desgraciadamente no saben como hacer las cosas, no se saben manejar, yo he visto como se les da un trabajo y no lo cuidan o no van o roban en el mismo trabajo, yo he vistocomo les han dado casas nuevas y las han destruido ellos mismos!!! o las vendieron, para irse otra vez al rancho donde antes vivian y con eso comprarse algun equipitode musica y lo demas desperdiciarlo en bebidas, como te decia, desde mi punto de vista, la unica solucion a la pobreza es esa, pero es demasiado complicado hacerlo, todos tendriamos que adoptar uno o dos bebes de flias pobres, y por supuesto, controlar el tema de la natalidad para que no siguen teniendo hijos, si ya no pueden con los que tienen!pero vos te pensas que alguien se va a poner a adoptar hijos de otros?mmmm sigue complicado el tema, no?|`|1410e1d7fd97a5dd9e45d9ae99cd0ac7aa	no tiene nada de malo usar la Internet, soy catlica y servidora de Dios y con toda sinceridad siempre ayudo a los dems que necesiten, ayudo a un asilo de anciano, los visito, ayudo a una casa hogar, doy lo que no necesito, si un peso me sobra y no lo necesito ese momento lo doy con mucho amor, pero si esta mal que te diga lo que hago, porque el nico que me interesa que lo sepa es Dios, siempre ayudare al que me necesite, si yo usara a la Internet para ofender o contestar preguntas que ofendan a Dios si estara mal, ahora yo te pregunto que haces tu, porque antes de hablar de una persona hay que vernos primero en un espejo. bye Que DIOS TE BENDIGA|`|82689351eae553bf76ee3a7de759997baa	no tengo los medios para ir a africa, pero ayudo a la genjte que me rodea.

Conozco personas que por su testimonio fue que me volv cristiano y ahora sigo sus pasos ya que son los pasos que nos ense? nuestro maestro Jess.  Pertenezco a una ONG cuyo proposito es ayudar a los mas necesitados y desvalidos, tomandolos como si fueran nuestros propios hijos para formarlos hasta que puedan valerse por si mismos. Muchos de los recursos los aportamos nosotros mismos de manera voluntaria y gratuita.  La iglesia a donde pertenezco tienen ya presencia en cuatro de los cinco continentes, y en la cual hacemos la misma obra de misericordia y otras mas, as como predicar el evangelio bajo el riesgo de sus propias vidas.  En cuanto al internet y la computadora, es una herramienta para extender el evangelio y hacer misericordia de una manera mas rpida y eficaz;  Nos han escrito familias al borde del divorcio a las cuales hemos podido ayudar para evitar su destruccin, hemos recibido correos en donde personas se quieren quitar la vida y hemos logrado que reciban tratamiento y dejen esa idea, y as, infinidad de situaciones que sin esta herramienta no hubiramos logrado enterarnos y podido resolver.  No construimos iglesias, por que preferimos utilizar los recursos para ayudar a la gente y predicar el evangelio.  En cuanto a lo de la coca, bueno disclpame, se que no merecemos nada, pero Dios es bueno y el no quiere que vivamos como ascetas, es decir, una vida de total abstencin de las cosas las cuales nos ha dado para que las podamos disfrutar, siempre y cuando como tu dices, no nos olvidemos de los dems, aunque debo confesar que a veces tambin nosotros nos encotramos en situaciones de carencia.  Finalmente, conoc este foro y he aprendido cosas, gente que habla cosas terribles contra Dios y los cuales jams me gustara estar en sus zapatos, Dios me ha mostrado la dureza del corazn de los hijos de los hombres, me ha mostrado el dolor que el siente por ser rechazado, despreciado, insultado y burlado, y me ha mostrado la necesdad de prepararme mejor para seguir siendo luz y enfrentar los grandes problemas que los seres humanos viven y seguiran viviendo cada vez de maneras mas terrbiles, Pero tambin he encontrado gente que se ve necesitada y que le doy algn consejo por si Dios les concede que se salven.  Espero que esta respuesta te ayude a cambiar tu percepcin de la vida cristiana, que lamentablemente la mayora de los que dicen creer no viven, para que as mejor un da nos veamos en el cielo.|`|46db4c67198017ed68f0bfde7782059daa	Que lindo poner a los creyentes en aprietos!!!!!

AA11885259	She-males, is a slang term used in the porn industry to describe performers who have decidedly female bodies but retain their male genitalia. Some transsexuals who get involved in this industry do so to earn the money to finish the expensive final surgeries to re-figure their genitals. In some cases the porn  industry ends up turning many of these individuals into stars and those performers find it difficult to leave that lifestyle.So, ultimately they live exclusively half-way and continue to perform and make films.  Sex reassignment surgery(SRS) is also one of the scariest parts for most transsexuals, as there is much uncertainty of the outcome from place to place and Dr. to Dr.. Although SRS is getting better the cost is another stumble ling block and a life saving can be spent to just be who they feel they are.

The Qur'an states that it is the duty of all individuals to learn about Allah and to live according to His will. As we cannot accomplish this be ourselves, Allah has sent messengers and prophets to guide humanity All of these chosen individuals have brought the same message and have served as examples to their people of how Allah desires all human beings to live. Through these selected people, we have been told why mankind was created, what will happen to us after death, and what Allah expects of us. But most importantly, we have been told that Allah is unique-He has no partners, no sons or daughters, and no competitors, as so many other man-made religious systems have postulated. This message always remains the same, whereas the laws laid down for a particular might show some slight differences.     Muhammad, the last of Allah's prophets, was sent to present Allah's revelation in its final form and for the last time. This was necessary because the message delivered by the previous prophets and messengers had been corrupted or distorted by their followers. They had been mixed with philosophical speculations, superstitions, myths, and neglect. Therefore, Islam is not a new religion-it is a restatement of the original religion of Allah in its purest form and is designed to provide humanity with the uncorrupted message of Allah.     Islam is an Arabic word that denotes submission and obedience to Allah. It also means "peace," for it brings peace of mind as well as peace on the individual and the social levels.           THE FIVE PILLARS OF ISLAM  In Islam, the term "worship" covers any action that one does in accordance with the will of Allah. It can be mental, physical, spoken, or otherwise. All such actions will be rewarded.     There are five acts of worship that are so fundamental that the Prophet grouped them together as the five pillars of Islam. Every Muslim is expected to fulfill these obligations. They are:           THE DECLARATION OF MONOTHEISM:  Recognizing and acknowledging the monotheistic nature of Allah stands at the core of Islam. This consists of a public affirmation that "there is no god but Allah (God), and Muhammad is His Messenger." One cannot be a Muslim until he states this fact in the presence of Muslim witnesses.     PRAYERS:     A Muslim must perform the five daily prayers. These must be performed at specific times, corresponding roughly with dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and nightfall. The prayers can be made in any clean place, but it is preferable to pray them with others in a mosque, for this communal undertaking acts as a reminder that all Muslims are equal. When many people are praying together, it becomes clear that color, economic status, social position, and all other artificial distinctions have no importance to Allah, for all Muslims are commanded to stand together, shoulder to shoulder, and prostrate themselves before Him. There are no exceptions. Prayers also elevated the individual to a higher level of morality, purifies his heart, and helps him to resist his desire to engage in forbidden activities.     FASTING THE MONTH OF RAMADAN:     Every year during the Muslim month of Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food, drink, and sexual activity from dawn to sunset. While this gives the body a much needed rest and improves ones health by getting rid of excess weight, it also increases ones commitment to Allah, develops his social conscience, and reminds him of how the less fortunate live every day In addition, it strengthens one's patience, self-restraint, will power, and sincerity.     CHARITY (Zakat):     Every Muslim whose net annual savings are above a certain specified minimum must pay an annual     amount of 2.5% to the poor and needy This action purifies one's accrued wealth, fosters the quality of sacrifice, and rids him of selfishness and greed. It also helps to reduce resentment and envy between a society's poor and rich classes.     HAJJ (Pilgrimage to Makkah):     Hajj is an act of worship that is to be performed at least once in a lifetime, provided that one is physically and financially able to do so. During this time, Muslims meet from all corners of the world in an international congregation for the sole purpose of responding to the call of Allah. It also reminds the participants that all Muslims are equal, irrespective of their geographical, cultural, or racial origins.           THE ARTICLES OF FAITH  All Muslims believe in:     . The oneness of Allah. Allah has no partner, son, daughter, helper, or competitor. There is nothing that even remotely resembles Him, for He is unique.     . All of the messengers and prophets of Allah. The Qur'an states that each people has received revelation from Allah in its own tongue so that all individuals know what is required of them. The Qur'an mentions twenty-five of them by name, among them Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Issac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, Solomon, John, Jesus, and Muhammad. There are, however, many others who are not named. Muhammad, the last prophet, was sent with a universal message meant for all of humanity The message revealed through him is the Qur'an, which is Allah's final presentation of the original revelation received by mankind in its purest form. A Muslim must accept all of Allah's prophets and messengers as legitimate, for denial of one means denial of all. For western readers who are not convinced that Muhammad is a prophet of Allah, proof of this claim can be found in the Bible (Deut. 18:15-18, 33:2-3; Isaiah 29:12; Songs of Solomon 5:16;John 14:1516, 16:12-14) as well as in the biographical accounts of Muhammad's life, which was lived in fu|`|bf1ddfd8f8fee8e9f3032d38cf283655aa	Faith is taking God at his word.|`|AA10798322	In a nutshell, it's synonymous with courage.    Courage because faith requires one to believe in that which he/she cannot see.       Faith is happiness.       Jesus said so to "doubting Thomas" after the Resurrection.

The first is reason. It is when the known evidence points to the statement being true, and when the truth of the statement doesn't contradict other knowledge. The second is faith. It is when one accepts a statement as true without evidence for it, or in the face of evidence against it.     The result of using faith consistently is the complete inability to think. Without any criteria for accepting a statement as true, every random idea, whether true or false, would be just as likely to be accepted. Contradictions would exist. No higher level abstractions could be made. Faith nullifies the mind. To the degree ideas are taken on faith, the process of thinking is subverted.     Faith is an act of mental destruction. If there is no evidence for a claim, then accepting it is irrational. It is more likely to be false then true (since there are more false ideas then true ones, being that their is only one reality). Building a structure of knowledge on such a flimsy foundation will leave it shaky and unstable. Eventually, even if confronted with evidence against it, ones mind will be so dependent on the belief that fear of ones world view collapsing will encourage one to reject the evidence. When this happens, one acts against reality. This is an act of destruction.|`|AA10380815	Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen.|`|b7XITVtQaa	to be sure of the thns we hope for, to be certain of the thns we cannot see.tak ur Bible and read further on the subsequent verses.   all the best.|`|C9bBlMS2aa	Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad-gita(17.2)  The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: According to the modes of nature acquired by the embodied soul, one's faith can be of three kindsin goodness, in passion or in ignorance. Now hear about this.    Further Krishna says Bhagavad-gita(17.3)  O son of Bharata, according to one's existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a particular kind of faith. The living being is said to be of a particular faith according to the modes he has acquired.    Srila Prabhupada writes in the purport.  The word sraddha or "faith," is very significant in this verse. sraddha, or faith, originally comes out of the mode of goodness. One's faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. One's strong faith is supposed to be productive of works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one's faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one's faith is established. It should be understood that if one's heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.|`|eoxEUUVNaa	During 1800s, Anthropologists had a problem as to how  to classify human beings. One resercher proposed the  expression "intelligent animal". After advanced studies  on monkeys, it was dropped. Another reseacher proposed  "tool using animal". After observing some animals  making wooden tools and sharpening them with knife like  stones, it was dropped. Another researcher proposed  "weapon using animal". A decade ago, a rare film was  shot in African forests. One short monkey was hit very  badly by a big monkey. The short monkey prepared a  wooden knife using stones and hid it on the top of a  tree. After some days, when the big monkey came to  attack the short monkey, it ran up to the tree for the  weapon it has hid and killed the big monkey. The one  thing that the anthropologists found with any group of  human beings, even if they did not have contacts with  the out side world for thousands of years, is  spirituality with some form of religion. So, man is a  "spiritual animal" if you want to call him that way.  "Manush" (human) was so named because he has "Manas" a  mind higher than that of the animals which realises the  divinity in creation. It was present since the creation  of human beings. Religion is the characteristic feature  of most of the human beings. It is as eternal and  and as unchanging as the Almighty.

I think it's important for a person to feel sexy, and at a certain point, your own concept of what is sexy in terms of your personal weight is going to differ from your lover's.  If you feel you're ugly and fat, the sex, while great for him or her, because you're the weight they like, still won't be good for you.  And of course, I'd want to be healthy, because a relationship jeopardized by diabetes, heart disease, etc., isn't good, but fraught with worry.

The earliest records for intentional castration to produce eunuchs are from the Sumerian cities of Lagash in the 21st century BC. Over the millennia since, they have performed a wide variety of functions in many different cultures such as courtiers or equivalent domestics, treble singers, religious specialists, government officials, military commanders, and guardians of women or harem servants. In some societies, the notion of eunuch has been expanded to include men who are impotent with women or are simply celibate."

To suggest that the church buildings all have one "shape" would be a peculiar notion at best. Most are shaped like any other church.

But in general, look at any church on your block, of any denomination, and a Baptist church won't be that far off from it.

You could always try looking at this the other way round.  What sort of person are you?  What sort of people do you feel comfortable with?  And if any of them are religious, what sort of religion do they go in for?    The essence of any religion is belonging to a faith community, so it's no good trying to work out what you believe first, finding a Church or whatever whose beliefs correspond to yours, only to go along to it and find that its members just don't have anything in common with you.    Keep a look out in your local media for news of what faith communities in your area are doing.

Religion is simply depraved humans attempt to reach God through their own efforts, which the God of the Bible rejects. So you can grab onto any of the world religions and they will get you to the same place, only through Christ can one have peace with God, be completely forgiven, called righteous and fully justified. Your problem isn't with your spirituality or lack of it, it is you, your sin. It is your sin that separates you from God. He is holy, you are not, He is righteous, you are not, He is just, you are not. There are only two ways to satisfy God's holiness and righteousness, either keep God's law perfectly, from birth to death, or fall on the One who paid your sin debt, the One who took your place on the cross. There is no other way. Simply believing in God is not enough, as James says:    Jas 2:19  You believe that God is One. You do well; even the demons believe and shudder.     Demons believe and even worship Christ. Unless you are called to salvation, shown grace from God and forgiven by the blood of Christ, your search will end in futility.|`|6ypnDnvLaa	First off, God(of the bible) doesn't want you to Join a religion.

You won't be disappointed.      There is a famous quote from over a thousand years ago that deals with this question...as it pertains to the Orthodox Christian Church!  "We did not know whether we were in heaven or on earth, for assuredly such beauty cannot be found on earth anywhere else...Only one thing do we know: that God was living there with men, and that their form of worship is the best of all. We cannot forget this beauty"    In many places of the Scripture we read "taste and see"! So I invite you to find an Orthodox Christian Church (Russian, Greek, OCA, etc. it doesn't matter) and attend a Divine Liturgy to see if you feel an echo in your heart - that the place where you are standing is Holy, that it is consecrated to God and His service, that God is there!     Most people having visited an Orthodox Service even once say that they never had experienced anything quite like it before. Or that they had never found another Church so conducive to internal prayer. Or a never felt feeling of repentance for sins committed long ago, came out of nowhere flowing up and spilling hot tears on the floor. There is Divine Grace here!

The first Eagle mentioned was Rome who went to Lebanon and plundered the city, Rome was and still is the land of traders the city of merchants. Rome was symbolized by an Eagle on their leader's staff. The second Eagle is the United States of America as symbolized greatly by an Eagle. Jesus Christ represents the Vine from the Cedar tree they took from Lebanon. which was then part of Judea.  Civilizations rise and civilizations go down in its respective times and places. America may come to the same terms which I cannot be certain if it will ever be because of God's punishment or man's irresponsibilities to himself thereby will be called the Wrath of God.

3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Yes.  Jesus said they were turning the house of God into a den of thieves.  The moneychangers insisted that those coming in change their coins to the "temple coins"...and ripped them off in the exchange rate.|`|AA11138696	They were not preachers.  They were money changers who exchanged local currency for the special coinage needed to purchase the things needed for worship like doves or lambs for sacrifice.    These services of course came at a price and often as in any market fairness to the customer was not a priority.  These people were doing business, crooked business and cheating the pilgrims that were required to come to Jerusalem to the temple.  The fact that they were feeding on their own people and off their faith angered Jesus and he drove them away.|`|2SzYXPrHaa	They refused to say tall, venti, and grande.  Jesus wasn't a carpenter.  He was a barista.
AA10029366	I agree that evolution is still considered a theory, so, fine -- they have the right to point that out.    Of course, there are many other well-known scientific theories:  1. Relativity  2. Plate Tectonics  3. The Germ Theory as it relates to disease  4. The Big Bang Theory  5. Cell Theory    Are the creationists going to demand that we label books related to those, as well?    That's a lot of labels. And, yes, Calvin -- to me it implies *fear*. Fear that their children will be blindly led into slack-jawed belief the same way they were...of course, not the belief *the parents* want their children to have.     Doesn't a pack of parents defending a petty semantic argument like it's a precious treasure seem a bit flailing? A bit desperate?    I don't understand why people underestimate the intelligence of their children. And I've always wondered why, if they fancy themselves so righteous and correct in their beliefs, they fight any attempt to provide a balanced education on the subject.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	Please don't use the word Christian  and Creationist to mean the same thing. Not only does the Catholic teach the evolution is just peachy, many Protestants are also just fine with evolution.|`|RermzbWgaa	It is a fact that Evolution is not a fact but a theory.  Therefore all the disclaimer did was tell the truth.  I am not sure why one would think the fear lays with those telling the truth and not from those who scream and carry on about that truth being told.  I have seen much on here from those that reject creationism that is much more full, or equally full, of fear as some creationists.  Why such fear of truth?    I too am for the debate and not shielding our children from that debate, but I am for the truth as well.  I do not care if one side or the other has fear about a subject, but I do care when that fear attempts to cover the truth.  Let the light shine (both sides).|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I think the disclaimer is right in the title - The THEORY of Evolution.  Nowhere is it called the FACT of Evolution.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	No I would not love my child less-- but I also think that if we're going to include one theory about how something happened-- we should also teach about another.  Teach evolutionism, teach creationism.  But since public schools aren't allowed to endorse religion-- why should they be allowed to endorse other theories?    It's hard to decipher what should and should'nt be allowed to be taught in schools, but my thoughts on it are-- if you don't want your kid to learn about it-- opt out for that lesson, just like you can with sex. ed., or home school.    I was taught from a young age what is right, according to my religion, and NOTHING that I was taught in school swayed that decision.  Teach your kids right from an early age-- and they'll know what they want to believe.|`|WxaCK4C7aa	I would disown my kid...but besides that if they hate evolution so much, why not kill their kid to stop them from seeing it.|`|AA11026827	I'm catholic.  My parents don't have a problem with us being taught that way.  It's school, and we are our own people.  We can make our own decisions.  My parents and grandparents don't fear it at all.  It doesn't come up in discussions either.|`|6cRj7pMSaa	I believe in both science and religion and I think there can be a healthy balance between the two.   We don't know exactly how the earth and people were at the time they were created.     I have no problem with evolution being taught in schools. I don't understand why all the religious fanatics are so terrified of scientific theories. Children are smarter than most give them credit, and whether it is taught in curriculum or not, they will figure things out for themselves. I'd rather them be well informed and taught something in their studies, than learning some back-woods bullsh*t from an unreliable source.     I think that most religious fanatics (I'm not saying Christians, simply because not all Christians think this way, I think it is more the hard-core "the bible said this so this is how it will always be" type of people.) think that science is "Satan's work in the mind" and that science will poison childrens' brains into thinking that there is no way God can exist if you believe in science as well.     I would love my children no matter what. Even if they all turned out homosexual. Isn't that what God says to do? Love everyone, no matter who or what they are and do? Isn't God about acceptance of all beliefs? Who's to say we can't have a good balance of God and science? We don't know what Adam, Eve, and their direct decendents looked like. They could have been short and hairy as a chimp. Eventually, when adequate housing and clothing could be made, they would have evolved and been less hairy, stood more upright.    I think if people could be more open-minded, they could come to see that we can and should, have both.|`|XEbe4Votaa	I have to admit, the broad misunderstanding of the definition of a scientific theory infuriates me.      The SCIENTIFIC theory is not some half cracked idea somebody came up with.  The SCIENTIFIC definition to a theory is as close to fact as it gets - there is nothing more proven in science, other than direct observable fact.  The creation of the earth is not something that can EVER be defined by fact because nobody was here to physically witness it - which is the ONLY way you can have a SCIENTIFIC fact.  Direct observation.  Science seldom uses "fact", rather, science seeks to disprove all falsehoods and weed through what's left to try and find the best answer.  A scientific theory is a widely accepted answer to a scientific question.  It's not considered a theory until it is widely accepted by the scientific community as being the best solution we have.      To choose not to teach our children the life work of thousands of scientists in a science class is an absolute travesty.       The word theory is used differently outside of science, and I think that is a shame because it results in confusion.    As was stated above, of course it's not fact...but when you study science you understand why it never can be (even if it really is).

They all hate it when you point out to them that they are bigots, even though their hatred of gay people and minorities can be described by no other words.

I thought that was obvious....|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	The belief in personal responsibility often includes the belief that many laws are necessary to bring consequence to those with no personal responsibility.  The fundamental goal here is to teach personal responsibility to those who inherently don't have it.    God bless you.|`|kdo6qnS9aa	Conservatives believe in personal responsibility, and they try to make everything harmful to society illegal.    Liberalism equals anarchy.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Conservatives as a group have a very strong tendency toward a predictable, uniform, top-down authority structure. Conservatives believe part of individual responsibility is to conform to ideals like family, country, and religion, where there is a clear authority figure, and abhor the idea of themselves or others leaching off of others.    American conservatives, for example, see America as an ideal to strive toward, to serve, and preserve, while liberal Americans see Americans as America with the liberty to choose how they will live their lives.    So, to conservatives, personal responsibility is about producing at least enough to carry your own weight, and providing for the needs of those who are in your care.    I'm not sure which laws you're referring to when you say conservatives try to make everything illegal, but if you look at the issues you're thinking of, you should find that the conservative stance consistently reflects the tendency to prefer uniform, predictable ideals with clear structure and rules.    Basically, conservatives like predictability.|`|affb92500c4092ec6665779d8a952b58aa	It's only other people who have to be personally responsible, different for them, don't you know.|`|FhHklqkhaa	hypocrisy|`|AAAw24KOaa	"You have as much personal responsibility as you like, so long as *I* define responsible."

Liberal Fascism offers a startling new perspective on the theories and practices that define fascist politics. Replacing conveniently manufactured myths with surprising and enlightening research, Jonah Goldberg reminds us that the original fascists were really on the left, and that liberals from Woodrow Wilson to FDR to Hillary Clinton have advocated policies and principles remarkably similar to those of Hitler's National Socialism and Mussolini's Fascism.    http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/displ...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsFoiVZDS...    Contrary to what most people think, the Nazis were ardent socialists (hence the term National socialism). They believed in free health care and guaranteed jobs. They confiscated inherited wealth and spent vast sums on public education. They purged the church from public policy, promoted a new form of pagan spirituality, and inserted the authority of the state into every nook and cranny of daily life. The Nazis declared war on smoking, supported abortion, euthanasia, and gun control. They loathed the free market, provided generous pensions for the elderly, and maintained a strict racial quota system in their universitieswhere campus speech codes were all the rage. .|`|fNw4wJSGaa	I don't think you want to start this fight.    Liberals aren't exactly interested in allowing you and I live our own lives. They want to do as much thinking for you as they can.    I don't much care for either group.

IaWlzcNsaa	I have and I think that there are other practices that might be better.  I personally enjoy Jin Shin Do.  It is a style of acupressure that is similar to acupuncture in that it works within the same meridians, only without needles, in order to put the body in balance and allow a person fall into deep relaxation.  It not only helps balance a persons Qi, but helps you get  out of your head in back into your body in mindful consciousness.                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Shin_Do     I'd skip the Reiki if I were you.  There are a number of other techniques that are better.|`|de2AwHpHaa	i practice and i'm impressed with myself.|`|IVy35SE2aa	I have a good friend who is a Reiki Master and teaches it.

It did -worse- than placebo.|`|N5ubpPxcaa	I have heard that it is scam- when originated and you need to pay exorbitant amounts for seminars to advance to a higher level.|`|Ys5fxV1faa	True story.....  In late May 0f 2006 my mother was in her final week of life. We took her home to die. They discovered she had cancer in 5 organs then they stopped looking. It took weeks to calm her down and get her to deal with what was happening, that she was dying. My brother came to visit with his Girl friend who was a Reiki Master. She was a Level one Reiki Master. It takes about 8 hour of class to be a level one master, all levels are called master. She insisted on treating my mother. Immediately after the treatment my mother was wild she became violent made animal sounds at us and would throw things at us. After several days everybody involved in taking care of her said that they had enough and they were leaving. She stayed that way until she lost consciousness a few days later and died.   That's my experience.  There are no meridians in Reiki, other than that I agree with skipping Reiki.

Even Darwin himself denounced his own theory before his death. But, this is rarely if ever told. So, to answer your question in my opinion we didn't evolve from monkeys.

The Strepsirrhini, or wet-nosed primates, which include lemurs and lorises, branched off around 63 million years ago.    Old World monkeys and apes divided from New World monkeys about 40 million years ago.    Aegyptopithecus zeuxis, which probably resembles the common ancestor of New World monkeys and apes, lived about 29 million years ago.    The apes split from Old World monkeys about 25 million years ago.    Humans and chimpanzees diverged 5-7 million years ago.    So yes on each split the original got left behind to stay as it was!

"The only reason one would have for wanting to outlaw homosexual marriage is a religious one. "    Your ENTIRE arugment seems to hinge on this 1 principle.  Ergo, IF you can find a SINGLE atheist or agnostic who doesn't support SS Marriages,  then your entire  argument falls apart because you have based it on the supposition that the ONLY reason is a religious one.    I have personally seen other R&Sers who profess to be atheists state that they are against SS Marriages.  They are in a minority, sure,  but none the less, they believe their are Non-religious reasons to oppose it.       ALSO, the second part of your argument is an oversimplification of the Christian concept.  This is where the Straw man comes in.  You can constructed an over simplified view of the concept of "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's"  OR anotherwards the concept that Christians should obey the law of the land, including the 1st amendment.    The Christian concept involves giving to the government what it asks of its citizens, so long as it doesn't directly conflict with morality.  Obviously the writers at the time,  especially the Jews of that era, would be WELL aware of conflicts between Government and morals. Roman Government often times surpressed and even forced its citizens to follow ITS code of laws and ITS religion. Some of these laws were in stark contrast to Jewish and later, Christian ethics.  The Polytheistic Roman beliefs were also in stark contrast to the belief in 1 God.     Therefore, obviously, the verses which deal with civil responsiblity DO NOT mean one should abandon their moral principles.     Your portrayal of this concept over simplifies it by insinuating that Christians should follow the qst amendment EVEN if it violates their moral principles.     I don't think this is TRULY what you meant to say..but that is the logical conclusion of your argument, judged entirely on what you have written here.    I don't mean to offend..merely point out the errors in your logic or merely how you stated it.   ____________________    So to answer your question:  NO,  so long as the person votes based on their moral principles, they are NOT comitting a sin.    Thank you|`|G3vJ5eflaa	It is NOT sinful. Yes we are to oney the laws of the land UNLESS they contradict the teaching of God. Sin God HATES and ABHORS homosexuality, we, therefore, MUST side with God and vote against it. A homosexual couple cannot procreate in and of themselves, we were not CREATED that way. Man and woman were created to procreate and worship God.     Look to the Greeks and Romans- their cultures agreed that homosexuality was good and became legally acceptable. Where are they now? Confined to history, by God. There cultures began to decline, quickly, after they accepted homosexuality.     I will side with God every time rather than man. God has proven Himself worthy, time after time. Man has proven himself worthy, also, worthy of not being holy and falling away from God.     Marriage IS NOT a right. Not even for heteros. In no shape or form is it a right. Homosexuals have more rights, with present legislation, than heteros have. The homosexual lifestyle is being forced on us. If the legislation is passed, we cannot speak up against it or we can be thrown in jail. What is constitutional about that? This is a country based upon free speech and thinking, yet the minority is trying to legislate the majority. THAT is unconstitutional!!    Even heteros must have a will to tell what happens to the kids. Homosexuals must avail themselves of the same things as heteros.|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	I don't believe in sins, but I would imagine it is, since people are using their religion to make laws (like you said) and also using their religion to take away rights from people and treat them poorly instead of with love.  Then again, the Christian version of "love" is usually hate so... I dunno.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Yes.  Treat others as you want to be treated does not mean take away their civil rights.  So it's a sin on several accounts including violation of the Golden Rule.  Scripture is very clear that revilers are not going to Heaven.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Not at all.

Of course it is sinful. In every sense of the word sin.   Hate is the primary reason and hate is based upon irrational fear and ignorance. Since the concept of sin itself has its' basis in religion one must conclude that anything sinful is against the deity and its' message. In the true spirit of Christianity the message is and should be that of Jesus the Nazarene! His message was and remains that of love, NOT hate! Therefore the message of hate used to argue against SS marriage is therefore sinful!  It is a message of hate and hate is not in any way a Christian value, It is a value of bigots!

When a man buys a woman a romantic gift, it is like saying, hey, I'm willing to spend my hard earned money on something to show you how special you are to me.  It also gives her a feeling of a man being the provider, and willing to provide for and cherish her.  Many girls like to give their guy gifts to show their love and appreciation to their man.  Have you ever heard of the book The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman?  According to this book, everyone has their own needs for different ways of giving and receiving love: Words of affirmation, Quality Time, Physical Touch, Acts of Service, and Gifts.  For example, you may not speak in the "Gifts" love language, but your girlfriend might, on the other hand, she might not speak in the "physical touch" department, but you do.     Since we live in a capitalistic country, businesses use this holiday as an opportunity to market and make sales.|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	lmao, don't even get me started!! ;-)

Others:  Is in-vitro normal?  Well, not normal, but safe.  Abortion? (Pro-life or -choice)    My views?  (If you care..)  I'm for gay rights.  Marriage is just a word--I'm for equal rights for civil unionized couples and married couples.  And i think LGBT should be allowed civil unions.  Marriage?  It's a title.  I don't like titles...  If i love a man, he's still my life?  I'll call him my husband if i want to.    I think LGBT should be allowed to adopt.  How many kids are in the adoption system.  If the kids don't care about living with two men, why should the government?  I think the kids should have a say in it though.    I believe homosexuality is genetic.  I don't ever remember choosing to like guys?    I'm pro-choice.  On certain conditions.  I think anyone under 21 should have the choice, indefinitely.  Because, a child could ruin their lives... (not ruin, but hurt..)  I think anyone with disabilities at risk of affecting the child should have the choice.    I think unsuitable parents should have the choice.  But, if you get knocked up, and your married, at age like 35--you should have to have that kid.  Unless your an alcoholic, or druggie.    Also, i believe that if you are an alcoholic or a druggie you should be tested, and not given your child untill you become clean.  You shouldn't raise a child around drugs and alcohol, what are you thinking!?    Ohh, and i think in-vitro is perfectly fine.
4b1ceaa46aa120eb6b53d8602b81f757aa	I don't believe you can water down a belief system just to find common ground.  I do believe the struggle to be "right" shouldn't supercede the call for Christians to "love their enemies".  The problem is, as a Christian, if I am right about what I believe: the only way to salvation is throught Christ, then the atheist must be wrong.  There isn't room in my beliefs (or int their belief for that matter) for both of us to be right.|`|f6743TA1aa	Why do you leave out Muslims, Hindus, Jews, etc.? Do you think there are only the two points of view?    Not believing in a god is not about a need to be "right" any more than not believing in leprechauns is about a need to be "right". Nor is it about shutting the mind to possibility. Or are you open to the possibility that leprechauns exist? How would you feel if your child's public school teachers taught your child that leprechauns are real and that they really do have pots of god at the end of the rainbow and that you could get that pot of gold for your child if you but believed strongly enough and lived your life according to special leprechaun rules? And if your government preached the same thing? Et cetera.     Most atheists couldn't care less what believers believe. Most of us just want them to stop pushing their beliefs into public policy and into laws that affect everyone and into schools that teach everyone's children.    And, yes, "faith and evidence really" are "so incompatible", because when you have one you don't need the other. Faith would be obsolete if there was evidence, and, obviously, evidence is totally unnecessary, and generally disregarded, when there is faith.    ~Atheist, ex-fundie-Xian, former New Ager|`|AA10873763	Heights.

f4ik0ScQaa	http://www.expelledexposed.com  Find the truth about the charlatans.    Yes they are, but the interview presented in Expelled does not include the context.  You can make anyone say anything by ignoring context.      The actual context was that the Prof. was asked if there could be ANY possible circumstances for intelligent design and he answered honestly.  Hypothetically, if an alien intelligence did exist and it's technology was sufficient, then it could intelligently design life (much like we are doing these days), however, and this is the key, the aliens would themselves have had to evolved naturally since evolution is only mechanism that can create life.  However, as he also said, there is no evidence for intelligent design, evidence that would be all over the place had an alien race designed us.    EDIT:  "I recommend changing your ID to Shoulderchip. It suits you better."  What was that you said about name calling?    "Dawkins admits intelligent design is feasible, albeit aliens."    He was speculating wildly like the interviewer asked him to.  If we can intelligently design life then an alien intelligence should also be able to.  Who would disagree with this?    Edit2:   Well to be fair, nature has had 13 billion years and we've only had 20 years realistically to do anything.  But already we have created completely artificial self-replicating RNA molecules in the lab.  This is something that nature only got round to doing 3 billion years ago, so we're catching up rapidly.|`|cvp0SEBNaa	Dawkins is not a champion of anything|`|0JHi6Rxaaa	Quote mine much Davy?|`|IDZTtipeaa	If you want Dawkins words, here they are:   "Another example. Toward the end of his interview with me, Stein asked whether I could think of any circumstances whatsoever under which intelligent design might have occurred. It's the kind of challenge I relish, and I set myself the task of imagining the most plausible scenario I could. I wanted to give ID its best shot, however poor that best shot might be. I must have been feeling magnanimous that day, because I was aware that the leading advocates of Intelligent Design are very fond of protesting that they are not talking about God as the designer, but about some unnamed and unspecified intelligence, which might even be an alien from another planet. Indeed, this is the only way they differentiate themselves from fundamentalist creationists, and they do it only when they need to, in order to weasel their way around church/state separation laws. So, bending over backwards to accommodate the IDiots ("oh NOOOOO, of course we aren't talking about God, this is SCIENCE") and bending over backwards to make the best case I could for intelligent design, I constructed a science fiction scenario. Like Michael Ruse (as I surmise) I still hadn't rumbled Stein, and I was charitable enough to think he was an honestly stupid man, sincerely seeking enlightenment from a scientist. I patiently explained to him that life could conceivably have been seeded on Earth by an alien intelligence from another planet (Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel suggested something similar -- semi tongue-in-cheek). The conclusion I was heading towards was that, even in the highly unlikely event that some such 'Directed Panspermia' was responsible for designing life on this planet, the alien beings would THEMSELVES have to have evolved, if not by Darwinian selection, by some equivalent 'crane' (to quote Dan Dennett). My point here was that design can never be an ULTIMATE explanation for organized complexity. Even if life on Earth was seeded by intelligent designers on another planet, and even if the alien life form was itself seeded four billion years earlier, the regress must ultimately be terminated (and we have only some 13 billion years to play with because of the finite age of the universe). Organized complexity cannot just spontaneously happen. That, for goodness sake, is the creationists' whole point, when they bang on about eyes and bacterial flagella! Evolution by natural selection is the only known process whereby organized complexity can ultimately come into being. Organized complexity -- and that includes everything capable of designing anything intelligently -- comes LATE into the universe. It cannot exist at the beginning, as I have explained again and again in my writings."  http://richarddawkins.net/article,2394,L...|`|QnH9QuQwaa	You're taking it a little out of context.  Dawkins is more open-minded on the subject than you might think.  But he isn't crazy.    Might I remind you that he also said that there is definitely a possibility that God or a god exists.  But that he personally doesn't see enough evidence of it.  He's open to seeing some, but nothing concrete has come to his table.      I'm a Christian, but I don't think Dawkins is an enemy at all.  He may be a pompous prick at times, but an amazing amount of knowledge will do that to a guy.    There are many reputable scientists who think that life arrived on Earth from a different planet, possibly even Mars.  They don't think like the Scientologists, they just think that life may have survived a trip from somewhere else.  But that it evolved there too.  They aren't claiming that green men dropped it off here.  Carl Sagan is another popular Atheist who pondered this theory.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Not only that he is exceptionally unoriginal. Did your source mention the panspermia of Hoyle.     The renowned Sir Fred Hoyle, known for his studies of star structure and the origin of the chemical elements in stars, has worked with Chandra Wickramasinghe over the past three decades to pioneer the modern theory of panspermia.    There is a form of ignorance that has moral implications.|`|dvY6UfiYaa	I am not visiting any site called "willyhoops".|`|37LKDbtsaa	Quote-mining, you are stupid enough to use it.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	ROFL aliens, infinite universes... it's amazing to me that brilliant men will believe ANYTHING rather than admit the evidence for God's handiwork in creation.|`|urIm4YaBaa	It makes more sense inasfar as we're still talking about biological beings that are subject to the laws of nature.     Mark my words: scientists will create life from nonliving matter in our lifetimes, and probably within the next few years (those following the research know that we're getting close to doing so). Mind you that we're having a hard time sending people to Mars; any beings sufficiently advanced to be able to traverse between solar systems would surely have enough biological knowledge to create life from nonliving matter.    With that said, there's no reason to assume aliens created us. It's just the better choice between that and a supernatural being. We know that the universe, life, and the laws of nature exist; we don't know that supernatural beings exist.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Right, who created aliens?|`|AA11058044	Anything in any way, shape or form connected to Ben Stein is automatically suspect, as he has shown himself to be a lying pusbag.|`|AA10067344	It's been my experience that creationists care way more about what Richard Dawkins has to say than anyone else.|`|AA11622701	If aliens caused evolution, where did they come from?    And even if evolution is true, it only explains the diversity of life, not the origin.|`|PKULDaC7aa	You are taking the statement completely out of context. Just because you believe in the lies of the bible doesn't mean we listen to everything every atheist says. Nice try though.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	He said it made more sense than god doing it (which wouldnt be hard) so tell me you're a christian,  why are you lying through your teeth then?  Won't your god get mad at you or something? bearing false witness and all that.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	They COULD be, sure.  Anything is possible, and you need to be open to possiblities.  Of course Alien intervention doesn't preclude the existence of God, it just enlarges the scope.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	WRONG!    Dawkins never said aliens "did" anything he was only forming a hypothesis.    Stop twisting his words around.|`|jOwH96wKaa	Yes it does, at least there's a probability that aliens exist.    The same can't be said for god.|`|sKXzYvaRaa	Actually he says it is possible that aliens did it... there is a difference.  It is possible that an invisible pink elephant did it too and I am sure some people would believe that if it had been written in a book 2,000 years ago.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	epic fail    sorry to burst your bubble,  thats not what he said|`|zQyslfHKaa	Horrraaayyyyyy!!!!  this hayseed just discovered cut and paste.|`|KJHt4hiYaa	It's called conjecture and scientists do it all the time- unlike religionists he doesn't mindlessly cling to dogma.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	Well, if he said aliens could have been the source he is not stating that they are the source.  He is throwing out a few ideas..      There is a  big difference.|`|py57svUyaa	I am not really sure I consider Richard Dawkins to be an evolution champion. Though there is much higher possibility of existence of life elsewhere then existence of a god.|`|AA10096992	If its not a religious god, what would it be?     Yes, it makes much more sense that an alien race -- advanced and extremely intelligent, rather than omnipotent -- engineered the human race. THIS would actually fit the ID proponents watchmaker theory better than a supernatural creature. It would also allow for the fact that our design -- if that's what it is -- is ingenious, but not perfect.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Wow. You are, (IMO) quite obviously, completely unfamiliar with  Mr. Dawkin's work .|`|YYsldZcYaa	Expelled?      That documentary was interesting- Bennyboy poked all sorts of little holes into the fine details of evolutionary theory, cried about the poor mistreated morons who try to dishonestly slip their crap into science journals by attempting to avoid peer review, all WITHOUT bringing up ONE piece of real tangible evidence for his own theory...      Whaddamarooon....|`|P0MRKEHXaa	The funny thing is, the ancient aliens, who are also advanced spiritual beings are what inspired early man to call that which they did not understand "gods" . So,in a way, everybody's right at the same time, just from different perspectives. There is a vast and all powerful consciousness, from which the energy that animates our bodies came from. Some call it "God"and understandably so. But I call it "The source" and we are connected both to it and to eachother. Just food for thought. Namaste|`|Z4avhg3eaa	Yes.  Yes it does.  Aliens having done it at least provides a way for us to investigate it.  How would they have done it?  How did they get here? Where are they now?  What evidence might they leave behind.     The origin of life on earth by seeding at least has the benefit of utilizing the laws of nature as we currently understand them, while opening the possibility of a few things that we don't understand yet.    What it gives the creationist is the unfortunate task of dealing with an infinite regress, which in the end the only available tool, and a poor one to boot.      "So where did the aliens come from?"    I don't care.  I'm only seeking to explain how life arose on earth.|`|7R3pNDJEaa	From your question: "Richard Dawkins...is...God"    See, I can cut and paste to create a quote too.|`|5e50c0ab71cc45110b7754fc5ce9ee2daa	Where did the aliens come from?                    Kp|`|FOZGMadaaa	Men harbor a spirit of deception. It permeates and creeps into a sect.    What is a legion.3,000 to 6,000 entities.    Satan sends one are he sends many. He loves to cover a territory.Science and exploration is his domain. Evolution is his major.    He is a trickster. He got many fooled,he knows God exist. So he keeps men entertained by looking at the creation instead of the creator of life.    There are many religious small g gods.    There is only one Omni God.     Man says it could be this and it could be that. Questioning? Well I guess? That is greed. men pay big bucks for that.    The people have to squeeze money out of their pockets. For the gospels sake. It is truth and revelation. The word evolutionizes men. It changes men into what they were originally meant to be,as God's plan.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	The universe has only been in existence for around 14 billion years. This is not enough time for life to have come into existence on earth and to have evolved.  Aliens coming into existence on some other planet, then seeding life on earth, is making the impossible even more impossible.

Sometimes two people don't exactly click in the sex department and since when you get married that's the only sex you'll ever be having again you should make sure that you and your significant other are good together sexually before tying the knot.|`|YS3E6Pz2aa	I do agree with you. In my state, I can't get married. And any ceremony I have will be considered void in Texas. Because texas is lame and republican.  But yeah, I agree with what you said.

DypTl9Zdaa	I have a few years yet to becoming a senior but I found your question interesting.  I think that many seniors are concerned with the way the youth are turning out.  There is a great deal of disrespect, lack of morality and a huge gap between the ideals of the elderly and the ideals of the young.  I would have to say that the youth of today scare me.  We as parents are not preparing them to be leaders.  We are not instilling the patriotism and the love for our country that so many of us were taught when we were young.  In addition, schools and many teachers at all age levels are failing to teach patriotism and what their roles are in order to keep this country great.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	How many elderly commit violent crimes compared to young people?

Now I notice my children are pretty strict with their kids -- I imagine my grand-kids will be a little too lenient, and it goes on and on like that.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Parents are to blame too, you know.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	Honestly, Most problems we face today are caused by the baby boomers.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	I blame the problems in society on seniors! I just stepped my foot in the adult world and they f*cked it all up for me!    Not only that if you wanna put the blame on someone, it's parents.

Ross Perot (in '92) warned us that if government didn't limit it's spending by a balance of the budget that future generations would suffer.  Why are we (as citizens) expected to balance our budgets in accordance to less (if any) income when government spends so wastefully and our politicians are supposed to be working for us?|`|xL6zc0bOaa	I put all the blame on this Government, bring back the birch, and bread and water for prisoners  make it so they wont want to go back to prison.|`|O9FojdEMaa	the problems should be place on the shoulders of the baby boomers. they were/are the gimme generation and never mind the cost. their parents should shoulder some of the blame for not teaching them better. and the grand children of the baby boomers are who i have to depend on to take care of me. may the GOOD LORD help us.|`|JIATcwW6aa	Oh no, I think there is plenty of blame to go around all age groups.      I also think the problems in society are specific to our times, just as problems of different natures occurred in the past.

Who raised the people, who raised the youth, who turned out like this? If they blame the youth for it, somehow they affected it.

xL6zc0bOaa	An honest answer to your question is, young  woman now, will not put up with what their mothers put up with.    And I say more power to them.|`|8G42oyydaa	Yes, as a society people have been "programed" by the media to expect marriage to be always "thrilling" and happy.  People have stopped looking at their parents and grandparents as role models.     Their role models now are those the media chooses for them. And those are always the most sensational and outrageous and unstable.     There is no message that relationships need work, vigilence and have to be nurtured.  Our society has developed a mind set that everyone should be "happy".      There is no acknowledgement that life is a series of ups and downs, highs and lows.    When someone isnt happy they run to their Drs to get a pill that will "make" them happy.  There is no sense of "this too will pass" or "when the going get tough, the tough get going."  And no sense of responsbility for their own happiness, almost everyone expects their partner to "make them happy".    When you have two people who are both looking at the other to "make them happy" no one is actually doing the work required to keep the relationship functional and secure.      When it doesnt happen they start looking outside the marriage for their "happiness fix", and of course they find it in the "thrill" of having something new in their lives.    90% of people will tell you "true love" is always happy and if it isnt and you have to work at maintaining it, it isnt true love.    This is the same thought process that leads to shopaholics and high consumerism.  External things to make you happy, and no sense that happiness is internal, something you work at and achieve without the need for "new things and props".|`|AA11296212	Marriage is 24/7, with no time off for good or bad behavior, requiring effort each and every day called "commitment."  Both parties have to give more than they take...in marriages that fail, one gives and the other takes.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	Could be two reasons among many. The willingness to actually 'commit,' to one another which can be from selfishness and just too lazy to work at a marriage. It does take work, but it is the type of work that can be very rewarding.|`|zRvt68ZYaa	Two things:    1) Men are too distracted by outside influences/work/tv to take good care of their wives and families    2) Women are programmed (as girls) to be princesses, believing their husband should be prince charming and life should have no adversity    Both make it nearly impossible to weather the storms of marriage.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	No, I think they decide not to waste time supporting a fraud.|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	maybe... but I also think because people are more independent today and are not scared to be divorced or alone.  Some people just choose to be happy instead of in a relationship that can't seem to work.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	Yes.  I also think that we sadly live in a disposable society.    People get rid of their spouses;  their children;  their pets and etc..    Without a backwards glance nor a second thought of sadness or guilt.  It's a very self absorbed / self indulgent / selfish society.    How very, very sad!|`|1lCUPVAkaa	I don't know about lazy, Self involved yes, We totally live in an era of  any thing goes, via in part Hollywood, media, false idols, Self respect  is not valued, jumping from bed to bed openly one has no need to  marry, just keep moving on. No time to hang around and find out, that  a long marriage is a victory for love itself, in spite of self. We live in a   very sad world of many fooled fools. Boozse and other drugs, media,  gutter speech, all of it goes together.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	They do.

Garbage in, garbage out, if you put inaccurate info into a computer, you can only get inaccurate info out of it.|`|QgzTdZ2uaa	Yes, in some cases. I think some people only care about their wants and needs and some don't want to compromise or do the "work" involved in keeping a marriage strong and together. However, some people are justified in divorcing their spouses like in the case of cheating, lying, abuse and personal problems like drugs and alcohol.|`|swErAbpQaa	selfishness. too many people care only about their own happiness, forget the innocent children or the grieving divorced spouse. laziness is also a culprit because it's the hardest "job" you'll ever have...aside from being a parent.    too bad because marriage is the classroom of selflessness.|`|9ac4efe2c281bd465dbf8d33952bdfb8aa	Unreasonable expectations.|`|5sNOUCRKaa	I believe we live in a disposable world I neither would have put up with what our mothers and grandmothers did either. It takes 100% of both of you to make in marriage and if one cant give do it , Its time to go.We has mothers have spoiled our little boys and girls so they seem to give up easy and fall in love easy so I do believe this generation does give up easy.
Xt4n9h40aa	Job, in these verses, is talking to the "friends" that came to set with him during his trials.  They were accusing him of unrighteous living and saying that he was secretly sinning and they wanted him to fess up to them what it was.  Job was trying to get them to believe him that he had done no wrong against God (as the Word confirms in Job 1:1 & 2:3).  His so called friends where trying to make themselves out to be holy and more righteous then Job.  Job was calling them on there condescending attitudes.  Asking them at what extent would they go to build themselves up against him.  He was not saying anything against God here.  He was just asking the "friends" just how far they planned on pushing their tactics.        Job 13:7-10, from the Amplified Bible  7- Will you speak unrighteiously for God and talk deceitfully for Him?  (meaning - You are trying to seem like you are talking to me on God's behalf but you are being deceitful in your true reason for being here.)  8- Will you show partiality to Him [be unjust to me in order to gain favor with Him]?  Will you act as special pleaders for God?  (meaning - Do you think by being mean to me that God will suddenly find great favor with you?  Do you think that acting holy when you really are not is going to trick God?)  9- Would it be profitable for you if He should investigate your tactics [with me]?  Or as one deceives and mocks a man, do you deceive and mock Him?  (meaning - Do you think that you would benefit if god decided to search your hearts and motives?  Or do you think that you can fool God as easily as you can man?)  10- He will surely reprove you if you do secretly show partiality.  (meaning - God can see right through their fa?ade and see their desire to be perceived as mighty men of God in man's eyes more then actually being mighty of men of God in God's eyes.)|`|95be5639aed6aa784e4750dbb0a7e356aa	Speak rightly about God, about who He is and His attributes.

Then the king will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me.' Then the righteous will answer him and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?' And the king will say to them in reply, 'Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.' Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, a stranger and you gave me no welcome, naked and you gave me no clothing, ill and in prison, and you did not care for me.'

He will answer them, 'Amen, I say to you, what you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me.' And these will go off to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."   Matthew 25:33-46    l For he will render every man according to his works . . ." (Rom. 2:6-8).   "For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified" (Rom. 2:13).   "For if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful prospect of judgments . . . (Heb. 10:26-27).   "What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not works? Can his faith save him?" (Jas. 2:14).   "So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead" (Jas. 2:17).   "But some one will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith. . . .Do you want to be shown, you foolish fellow, that faith apart from works is barren? (Jas. 2:18-20).   "You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone" (Jas. 2:24).         HE WHO HATES ME HATES MY FATHER ALSO. IF I HAD NOT DONE AMONG THEM WORKS SUCH AS NO ONE ELSE HAS DONE, THEY WOULD HAVE NO SIN. BUT NOW THEY HAVE SEEN, AND HAVE HATED BOTH ME AND MY FATHER;       Someone better tell Jesus he didnt have to do Those pesky works he was doing and speaking about,

ljzb6fZBaa	It is human nature for us all to think that other Christians have their lives straightened out and we are the ones having a hard time struggling with our sinful nature. But if the truth be known, each of us has our own battles to deal with. No matter how mature we are in our ?hristian walk, we are at different stages of growth, and the Lord is able to meet us at our greatest points of need. "Love is patient and kind" (1 Corinthians 13), so be assured, sister, that the Lord is patient and kind with each of us - He doesn't despise our shortcomings, but He sees us in His perfection, for we are found in Him. :)    There is a beautiful picture of the tender, loving care of our Lord as a good Shepherd, especially to the lambs - a picture of new believers in Christ.    "He will feed His flock like a shepherd;  He will gather the lambs with his arm,  And carry them in His bosom,  And gently lead those who are with young."  (Isaiah 40:11)    Notice our Lord Jesus pays special attention to the lambs, who are like baby Christians, and He carries them in His bosom - the place of His heart of love. Though you may think you are far away from our Lord compared to other Christians who are more mature, you are actually the closest to His heart! They should envy you, sister, not the other way round. :) He wants you to comfort you, and assure you of His unconditional and unfailing love. Little lambs need time to grow - until then, they simply rest and feed on the love of Christ, and be nourished and strengthened. The shepherd's bosom is a place of protection - no wolves can come close to pester the lambs, though their howls may be loud. In the same way, the devil's accusations may sound loud in your mind, but ignore them and stay tuned to the warm, friendly voice of the Holy Spirit inside you that affirms you are a precious daughter of the Most High God, and you are the righteousness of God in Christ. :)    God's Word promises that when you are established in righteousness, you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear. (Isaiah 54:14) Because Jesus has clothed you in His robe of righteousness, God sees you in Jesus' own righteousness - He does not see your sinful nature anymore. (Isaiah 61:10) You are a new creation; old things are passed away; behold all things have become new. (2 Corinthians 5:17) Notice the word "behold"? God wants us to behold and focus on our new identity in Christ - we have been made holy, blameless and above reproach! Jesus' blood has washed us clean from every sin, and made us kings and priests - we have royal blood flowing through our veins. :) (Revelations 1:6)    You are a tremendous blessing going somewhere to happen, sister. You are a unique child of God, with gifts and callings no one else can have - you are able to encourage other people, sharing from your own experiences, and they can relate to you because they can identify with you at your level of growth. Therefore, it is not true that Jesus only loves us or uses us when we have arrived at a more spiritual level of growth or something - nay, Jesus loves us all the same, regardless of our stage of Christian growth. Remember the woman at the well? She was an outcast in Samaria because of her lifestyle, yet the Lord Jesus chose to identify Himself as the Messiah, and she became the first evangelist who witness to everyone in her hometown about Jesus as the promised Saviour of the world. :) Compare this scenario with the earlier chapter, when Jesus spoke to a highly respected Pharisee called Nicodemus - Jesus told him that he must be born again. That goes against the grain of religious mindsets - one would have thought that Jesus would proclaim to the religious leaders that He is the Messiah and tell the common people that they must be born again. But God's ways are higher than our ways - His ways are ways of grace and mercy - God takes pleasure in those who worship Him and trust in His mercy. (Psalm 147:11) :)    Lift up your head, O daughter of Jerusalem, and know you are victorious and more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ who loves you and gave Himself for you. :) Know that the enemy has been defeated at the cross, and his accusations have no power over you.    "this is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him:  The virgin, the daughter of Zion,  has despised you, laughed you to scorn;  The daughter of Jerusalem  has shaken her head behind your back!  Whom have you reproached and blasphemed?  Against whom have you raised your voice,  and lifted up your eyes on high?  Against the Holy One of Israel."  (Isaiah 37:22-23)    You are a warrior bride, sister Sue. You have been raised together with Christ and seated with Him in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is to be named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. (Ephesians 1:20-23) You are the apple of God's eye. You are blessed and cannot be cursed. The enemies come to you one way, and flee before you seven ways. Nothing can separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. If God is for you, who can be against you? (Romans 8)    Peace be with you, sister. :)|`|63oSbqZlaa	Tell God your concerns...He does not want you to be unhappy and being a Christian is not based on never having any fun......You can have fun all you want. Go play disc golf or something...get involved with others who are not drinking and drugging and go out to a movie, to eat, to a carnival.....Who told you that you are not supposed to have fun....and what do you mean you don't have the Spirit anymore? Once you are saved the spirit dwells within you and you don't lose it.|`|RZn529cmaa	You did not say how old you are but I could relate to your situation. I grew up as a devoted Catholic and actively participated in several religious activities. But between the ages of 18 to 25, I started to question the teachings of my religion. I am now an adult and at peace with my inner self. I still believe in the existence of God but no longer believe in all their teachings. As long as I love and respect my parents, elders, relatives, friends and people I deal with; and do not harm, physical or emotional, to other people, them I am at peace.    Let me mention one example. When I was at a youth religious retreat, the priest told us that masturbating is a sin, looking at beautiful girls is a sin, etc. We all followed what the priest told us at that time, but no more.    So throw away the guilt and enjoy life.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	God says in the Bible that "those who endure to the end shall be saved". It is not an easy road to be different than the world, and we need to stay fixed on Jesus Christ. He is our hope for this troubled world. The devil is out to steal our joy, destroy our lives, and kill us because we love God and he knows his time is short and he is trying harder than ever to get us to doubt our salvation, and get discouraged. If he can make us do that, then he wins. He doesn't bother who he already has, he will find our weak spots and attack them. He knows the weakest link on the chain will break it!   It will be worth it all when we see Jesus, and we have not given in to the devil. Psalms is a good place to read when I have discouraging times, and think that all is for nothing. And most of all, pray that God will help you and show you what to do and where to go for spiritual help. I know that when I am struggling with my health or something in my family, I feel like I am alone and God doesn't care and I am all alone, but He is my comfort and peace, knowing that it will all be over soon.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Start by going for a long walk.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Turn to Christ, get into God's word.  Get into a bible study and stay there...and walk in His ways.  Take it from a sister in Christ, there is no other way out.  Do not panic.  There is a huge amount of spiritual oppression going on against all of God's children.  Your only weapon is Jesus Christ, the word of God, prayer, and being obedient to God's leading.  Do these things, follow Him, keep your eyes on the Lord.  He will not let you fall.|`|E9chZY74aa	9 times you talked of your feelings.  Feelings are fickle and not reliable as a guide.

We cannot be perfect, only Jesus did that.  We are going to make mistakes, sin and try to get  up and do it right next time.  If you seek God and pray, He will help you through this struggle you're having.  Regardless if you fail or not, He loves you anyway.  You're going to feel guilty if you make a mistake and you knew it was a mistake.  That's just apart of life.  But vow to try and make better in choices in the future.  Have some fun, but not too much!  Enjoy yourself and enjoy having a relationship with God!|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	You are finally starting to realize that Christianity is a farce and you are coming to your senses.

I am and i have a fiance that i live with. He is such a bad influence on me. I cant get out of this rut i'm in.     you dont have to stop being a christian. Just be what you are. God will still love you.|`|AA11502346	Okay, push yourself away from your computer and take a deep breath and exhale.  Feel better now?    You can still have fun with your friends.  We are saved by grace and not by legalism.  Just make sure that you keep a monitor on your activities and where you spend time with your friends (i.e. at a cafe as opposed to a dive bar).      By filling yourself with other stuff, you are not getting any spiritual fulfillment.  You need to fill yourself with the Holy Spirit.  How about attending activities at your local church with people your age?  Invite your non-Christian friends over for a night of good, clean fun!    Now, pray to God about this.  Tell Him exactly what you have told me.  Read some Scriptures.  Take care and God bless!|`|7kJFmyxdaa	What you are going through is something even I went through at one point in time. The "good ole days". I use to go to the bars and night clubs. I use to go to parties with my friends. Partying and drinking was my life, but I do not have the desire to do this anymore.     Now, when I decided to stop going to the clubs and partying with my friends the change did not happen over night. It took me a long time to stop going. I would stop and then get drawn right back into it.     Then one time I was in the club and I thought to myself, "this is just not fun to me anymore." From that moment on I stopped. I have never looked back and this was 10 years ago. Do I miss it, no, but that doesn't mean that I still don't get the urge to go. But, greater is God who lives within me.    You are going through the spiritual battle between your old self and your new self. I don't know if you are talking about clubbing and partying, but it is a spiritual battle we go through everyday of our lives. Satan knows our weaknesses. He knows our desires. He will use them against us. This is when you must lean on God. He is more powerful than Satan will ever be.     Don't put so much pressure on yourself. Ask God to help you with this battle which is happening within you now. He will do it. Your strength comes from God and God alone. Apart from Him you can do nothing. What is impossible with us is always possible with God. Lean on Him.|`|oKAFHgscaa	I'm sorry, but you don't sound like you really know what Christianity is all about.    Righteousness, peace, & joy in the Holy Ghost.    You're in the worst possible place you can be... neither hot or cold... but lukewarm...  There are many Christians who are there, because there are the hypocrites who do not enter in, & they prevent others from entering in.    Matthew 5:6   Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.    John 7:37-39   37 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.   38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.   39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)    John 4:13-24   13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:   14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.   15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.   16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.   17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:   18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.   19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.   20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.   21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.   22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.   23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.   24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.    Romans 8:9   But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.|`|AUsvrW8faa	Hey there Liz, hang in there and be encouraged. Your flesh wants what your spirit doesn't.  Pray Pray Pray and tell God exactly what you typed above- You can make it - I think we all go through that.    Read this:    Romans 14-20  14We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.[c] For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to dothis I keep on doing. 20Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.

You should remember though that some Christians teach one thing to be sin and another Christian could see the opposite. Read the Bible, find someone you trust and has good standing in their fate and go over your issues with them.     And, if you know whatever sins you're committing aren't fun, don't do it. It looks like fun for non-Christians because they don't have that guilt of committing a sin, or knowing it's a sin. It will always seem like they're having more fun because of this. But remember--they probably have as many problems as you, and don't have the Christian base to refer to for strength. They look elsewhere, or just don't have it.|`|uCD0cKttaa	pray and meditate maybe try a new path.i hope it helps|`|gKdhwVN2aa	Simplify your life!

Not other people's idea of fun, and hey if what they're doing is fun go ahead a join in. Just know you're limits. Don't do things that make you feel uncomfortable.  It's a bit hard to answer this question since the "sins" you speak of aren't really specified. But whatever it is, if you think it's immoral don't even bother doing it.  You don't have to stop being a Christian either. I'm not sure how hardcore you are into your religion...from the sounds of it though you sound very concerned with it. Just know that you're allowed to make mistakes, don't let the religion make you feel cruddy for the things you've done. Just before you do something, take into consideration your morals and beliefs. If you mess up, oh well, life goes on. Try to do better the next day.  Do what makes you happy, you only live once.   Just try to stay out of trouble.   Breaking the rules from time to time though is healthy if you don't get into anything to bad.  Best wishes and I hope you solve your inner struggles.

But I'm over 45, and I can tell for certainty that the grass IS NOT greener on the other side . And I can also tell you, that a blessing is coming your way, and that's why the conflict.  The devil will definitely rob us if he can .|`|2BjgIlbDaa	James 4:3    Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.    -okay girl you know the truth and you want to hold onto it. Your determination [oddly enough] is what i believe is giving you a hard time. i honestly think the devil recognizes your strong faith and HATES IT. he hates that you believe in God so much. and hes gonna try to put whatever crap and desires into your head.     Its human nature to have sinful desires. thats just how we are. Your not a hopeless case. Keep resisting, keep praying for Jesus to help you throught this. God has not left you, and the devil WILL flee.    You can just take practical steps too help you not want to do bad things. having Non-christian friends is not bad, but if they are who you and spending most of your time with, it is not doing you any favors. If you have any strong relationships with ppl that dont share your faith, I would put them on hold for a little bit, just until you get your strength back. Trust me, it REALLY helps. If you around those that do share your belief it is so much different. there is encouraging and support. ect. ppl that probably can relate to you. Otherwise non christians are usually like "well who cares you might as well just do it"  ya know?They will never understand you if they arn't in a relationship with Jesus. you will just sound like a crazy person.  Second, i would try and not go to places where bad behaviour is encouraged. Like parties, bars,  or whatever. All that does is entertain your struggle.     Its like giving a ciggarette to someone who just quit smoking.     So I hope this helped you a little bit. I know how you feel trust me, when im around my old friends i have those old feelings creep up on me and i hate it. But again, the devil will flee you, not forever, but God will always come back to rescue you.     So please, i dont know who and what activities your life includes. But Having a non-christian boyfriend, best friend, or anyone else close can be really detrimental on your faith. Just distance yourself for a while. And this advice isnt just comming from me.     [an article i found]  " Often times, there is the temptation to marry, or be in a serious relationship with,  an unbeliever because they "are so nice, or handsome, or lovely" and that we will "lead them to Christ" later.  This is again defying God's commands and usually ends up in misery and/or divorce "    "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial [Satan]? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?  What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols?" [2 Corinthians 6:14-16]    okay well...good luck =)

AA11923447	Yes. I learned some hoodoo while growing up, and also some various magickal practices, including chaos and ceremonial magick. Also some folk practices. However, a good bit of this information came from classmates at school and other friends, and not from my devoutly Christian family. Many of my friends carried mojo bags, knew how to use magickal oils, seals and powders, and practiced hoodoo.|`|4WqvTAfmaa	One of my students turned out to be holder of his family's tradition, from the Sib Djisovi Simenu, out of Dahomey, through Jamaica. He taught me the Teaching Spells, and worried me to do things "right" on all forms of magic, thus training me fairly well in the tradition.     At the same time, I learned to work the Runes, which is associated with my Germanic blood, and labyrinths, which I associate with my French blood. Nothing seems to have come through the Irish blood.     Note that I hold the family teachings for a black family, and I have no black blood in me.     He was a trickster, and fooled all but death. I miss him.|`|Lwf475l2aa	No, but I wish I had been!  It seems so fun! :D  Everything I know I learned on my own *sniffle*|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, there is the dog wish.

It is a problem management meeting and the name was given as a way to describe what it is like.

dDMOJWxwaa	In that we are hardwired to be social beings.  God has commanded us that a full person is two , husband and wife, one flesh, one in purpose, one in unity.    One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do  Two can be as bad as one  It's the loneliest number since the number one    No is the saddest experience you'll ever know  Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know  `Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do  One is the loneliest number, worse than two    It's just no good anymore since she went away  Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday    One is the loneliest, number one is the loneliest  Number one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do  One is the loneliest, one is the loneliest  One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do  It's just no good anymore since she went away|`|J7KSKm54aa	Awww, for me it means only one God is a lonely number- when there is really two.|`|Ur53Pf6zaa	Ok.  That sounds fun ....    Let see ...     One is a lonely number and God was just One.  Therefore God was lonely.  So, he created.  He created a son, Yeshua.  Then God  had one son, and loved Him, but could love much much more.   So through Yeshua, he again created.  He created universes, and black holes, molecules and atmospheres  ... all to sustain the real object of His love - mankind.   He put his first born as Lord over all mankind and all His creation.  And Yeshua, His first born, the first one, loved also.         So God called them 'children' and called Himself  'Father'.   Therefore  God created one family.   God wanted to love and be loved.   One man named Adam brought death into the world.  One man named Yeshua took it away.  One kingdom is now being prepared.                   All because of the lonliest number ... one.|`|HAgd5asNaa	The called ONE    And i guess it means there is no way to succeed in life without other people and God. Life is for serving others.

I just didn't, and I used to dream about her all the time before she died. I think that it was just too much for my brain, too much pain, and as a protection, even my subconscious avoided the pain. Now, I occasionally do dream of her, one or two have been wonderful, and very real, even feeling her hair, and her clothes.  Maybe it's too much for your mom right now.

meJOgDHKaa	There are many factors to take into consideration such as   Location- a body buried in a cold climate will decompose more slowly than in a hot climate    Type of coffin-  sealing coffins the type with the rubber gasket around them lock out air and other substances this is good and bad it locks in the anaerobic bacteria and can cause the body to decompose faster  but also locks out foreign substances   Temperature- the temperature can cause insects and other substances to enter the grave and wreck havoc on the body as well as cause bacteria to multiply   Weather- rain can seep into the vault or coffin and cause the body to decompose faster    Vault- different burial containers work in different ways some seal out dirt and water while others just protect the earth from collapsing the sealing vaults will keep out elements which affect the body    Type of burial- and in ground burial can expose a body to elements but a burial in a mausoleum  can expose a body to insects but a mausoleum burial can dehydrate the body because of the dry air inside of the mausoleum and inhibit decomposition    Embalming fluid- fluids are manufactured differently they contain different levels of formalin as well as different chemicals and when diluted will fix the tissue differently   Embalming fluid strength- when the arterial solution is prepared it is diluted based upon body conditions so the percentage will differ from case to case  Arterial solution mix- arterial solution is a mix of preservative water and co injection chemicals such as humectants and water softeners the chemicals in the solution like the ingredients in a cake effect the outcome    With all of that being said it is hard to say what a body will look like in 10 years but I can say that most embalmed remains are adequately preserved for decades as evidenced in embalming history theory and practice they had to move an 85 year old mausoleum with about 650 sets of embalmed remains  of those 650 only 35 were in active decomposition and some were still very recognizable including cloths and jewelry|`|K0iFV73Gaa	All it a a hair and bones|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Like John McCain.|`|J7KSKm54aa	Hey Sunshine- that is another Myspace trap!:(|`|rLc1QeVbaa	it's entirely dependent on the coffins resistance to moisture and other things even if embalming is performed. it's possible for the body to remain it good shape for many decades (edgar mevers comes to mind)|`|eCp0ERSCaa	It would entirely depend on the burial conditions.

I will definitely pray for you.    :)God bless|`|IGqAk2Ncaa	Im not Christians but i agree with VannaMoe|`|P6atY3xXaa	A.  There WERE no talking snakes.  Which is likely why Adam was not deceived by the lie.  1 Timothy 2:14.  He was in the garden alone for a long time before Eve.  He named all the creatures and knew none could talk.    A spirit creature who was far older and knew far more than him, tricked Eve by appearing to make the snake talk.  Rev. 12:9....    We are definitely made from dirt though.  Our food plants grow in dirt and get their materials and minerals, etc. from dirt and water using sunlight for power (photosynthesis).  Animals eat plants or other animals, then we eat them too.  So it all begins in the dirt/mud still.  We witness our food made from dust all the time.    Debbie|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Ok. Some seriously stupid answers to some seriously stupid questions.    1. The Bible says that when God cast Adam and Eve out of the garden he punished the naughty snake by making it crawl around in the dust and took away its voice. So that's why snakes don't talk anymore, or have legs. And I'm not sure if the snake that Adam met, since it had legs could really be called a proper snake in the first place. Sounds like a lizard to me, but then a talking lizard is probably just as crazy.    2. Mud. Something about ashes to ashes, dust to dust. We die, turn back to mud. So there's lots of mud, which is really just lots of dead people leftovers. Remember that next time you trod on some.|`|L6E6lDGKaa	I thought evolutionist claim we evolved from mud too. Only they believe mud leaped to life on it own. So, you will have to answer your own question.     While you're at it, you might want to give thought as to why you guys think there is only one species of talking monkey, humans.     See, you are not all that far from creationists as you think.

Essentially that opportunity to draw close to God, to develop your relationship with Him and to come to a better understanding of ourselves is lost.

Its a horrible word to use, and I don't condone what she said but it was a private conversation which didn't need to get so out of hand.|`|khJBfboRaa	I agree with you 100%.  I think it is atrocious that "toffs" like Carol Thatcher, Prince Harry and his father use this archaic, casually racist language.|`|mNzgWFkGaa	The most important thing here is that it was meant to be a private conversation (or at least off air) no matter how distasteful the comment and she would be within her rights now  especially in PC obsessed , nanny state Britain to sue the BBC for everything she can. It works two ways. So what this episode actually MEANS is that anyone ( doesn't have to mean famous person) can have any conversation taped and have Absolutely everything they say scrutinised in order to be brought up in there face at any convenient opportunity.  So any conversation you have can be bent to make sure you are labelled in some way.  Spot on Dennis C! Just because she made one racist remark does not automatically warrant sacking if  that happened all the time then think about it!  Practically no one in Britain would have a job.  FACT.    You can't have any control over the way people think. Anyway it wasn't really a racist act, Prejudiced yes.  And a very important last point, What ever happened to the Christian attitude of FORGIVENESS ?|`|KH331jojaa	Racist remarks might have been tolerated years ago, but this 2009  And they should not be tolerated now.

It is not words that are wrong but the manner in which they are spoken and exactly what or whom they refer to.

This suggests that she was doubly at fault -- first to say such a thing and secondly not to have the grace to apologise.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	I do.  The BBC gave her a chance to apologise and she refused. There was a lady from BBC  explaining the decision tthis morning. There had been a few complaints from the company she was in,mainly I believe,Jo Brand. As the lady said,it may have been a so-called private chat,but was on BBC premises and therefore needed to abide by their internal rules.  Thatcher is also a so called intelligent mature individual and must have known that the name was not appropriate,yet she chose to use it.|`|7b71287270d8cb608d239de158f4a044aa	The 'presenter' was Jo Brand - a comedienne who has yet to make me laugh - and labour supporter who had already been reprimanded for making an unwise remark and parades her politics like a high school banner. Whereas Carol's remark was a little inappropriate I don't think she should have been sacked for it. But I doubt she will come to any harm as she will now become a focus for all the abuse hurled on us by the left-wing politically correct idiots who infest our lives. Clarkson for President any-one?|`|7i6qj4OXaa	No I don't agree with you.  I had a gollywog as a child and never even associated it with black people, mainly because I'd never seen any I suppose.  But I was brought up to believe 'Stick and stones may break my bones but calling will never hurt me'.  I think it's time society grew up and stopped worrying about such trivia.

RC5RAzykaa	I have katapausis showing as "a place of rest" which is Jesus basicially saying they shall not enter the Kingdom when he uses this word saying "they shall not enter into my rest"    Katapaou being simply "put to rest" and not necessarily related to the seventh day    And Sabbatismos being related to the Holy Sabbath, the seventh day, and relating to Gods people as you have stated, for the Sabbath was created FOR man.    As for your grace vs law argument.  It was only the ordinances of men that was put to rest.  The law (Ten Commandments) remain until heaven and earth pass away.    Matthew 5:18  For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled    Sin is transgression of the Law.  1st John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.     So, if we are under grace (and I grant you that we are) are we to continue to sin (transgress the law)?    Romans 6:15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.     NO! We keep the law because we love God!  1st John 5:3     For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.     Grace covers our pasts sins, and the future ones only if they are repented of, and we proceed to keep the Law.  This is grace    People like to say "we do not need to keep the Law because we are under grace"  This is a lie, and it is spoken by people who love sin, and, in their pride, refuse to give it up.  Grace is ineffectual for such as these.    The Ten Commandments are often kept by most practicing so called Christians except for the graven image Commandment, and more often than this the Holy Sabbath Commandment (which is Saturday)    But if you break the Law in one respect, you are guilty of breaking it all.    James 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.     This means those who break the above stated Laws are guilty of murder, they are adulterers, they are theives, they are idolaters.  Grace can only work on such as these if they repent, and discontinue to sin.  Otherwise, they shall never see the Kingdom.    Basically, grace is only effectual for those who will henceforth keep the Law.

VRsu7c3Paa	I think this season pretty much sucks. Of course they had to get Max pregnant, and of course they had to put Jenny in a completely unstable relationship.     The plot is centered around Jenny (least favorite character) and has had some poor acting. Nikki's little monologue after going out and partying "you're going down Schecter" was probably the worst acting and writing.|`|BD8O7RR3aa	I haven't watched the show in forever, but I followed like the first 3 seasons.    I friggin hate Jenny and I think Shane is scraping the bottom of the barrel with her - especially after Carmen - damn!!|`|9MRSjkkxaa	I HAVNT BEEN ABLE TO WATCH IT!!!  And i want ot sooo bad.

What channel and what time?|`|tbKT835waa	I think that it is a little weird with Jenny and Shane hooking up. It almost seems like Jenny is way more into it then Shane. Shane almost seems like she is going along with it because she wanted Jenny to forgive her. Who knows maybe it will work out for a little while. Yeah I think that it was probably Nikki who stole the negative for the film. She went a little crazy when Jenny kicked her out and told her that it wasn't her who broke her heart. I read on eonline.com that Sarah Shahi is pregnant and that she will be making an appearance on the final episode.. so excited.. loved Carmen!|`|M2agV5zuaa	All I know is....................MAX IS CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|m1OGfRejaa	I haven't really watched the rest of the seasons..sorry.|`|sLaoidXqaa	I think its great that jenny and shane are together! there hot together, lol.. but Carmen comes back for the final episode so i hope that shane will get back with carmen!    I thinkt the season is going great im loving bette!
zHle6Paqaa	Yes. They've traded their Alters in for Stages.  It's all about entertaining and Not about Worship.    Marketing 101, It's all about Perception...Nothing to do with the Product.|`|gkffZHF2aa	Oh, my goodness, yes.  Don't get me started.    Now, I'm not one to stand on "it doesn't say that in the Bible" when it comes to every single detail of what a worship service looks like.  But when we're talking about putting in a "coffee cafe", and going nuts with technology -- big screens, massive sound system, lighting that needs an expert to run it -- as well as putting maaaaybe a little too much emphasis on the "praise band", then what's happening is MARKETING of Christianity.      I know people who go from church to church simply because they're looking for better music.  Never mind the message; never mind the Bible study.  Gotta have a good beat to get 'em up and moving their arms around.  They may be shouting "praise God" but they look like they're groupies at a concert.  Last I checked, worship and entertainment weren't synonyms.    Odd that the very ones who complain "I wasn't getting fed!" are more impressed with this type of pablum than the meat of the Gospel.  If that comes first, then by all means bring in the band and let's sing His praises.  But if the bells and whistles to bring 'em in aren't balanced by good solid teaching, they aren't going to stay very long.  In more ways than one.|`|6zo7eKT5aa	Customers... I love it!|`|AAAw24KOaa	We are building a religion.  Are you living comfort eagle?|`|wnGpAVGFaa	Yes. The churches I grew up are turning more to fog machines, playstations, and wi-fi access to attract its participants. I think the public is slowly realizing that churches are just like businesses. They sell a product and are finding more effective ways to market that product. And as a result, I think they are moving further away from the difficult bible stuff because we are finding that we do not need that kind of ancient, pre-modern script to add value to our dissimilar lifestyles today.|`|MMImKRAgaa	Do you mean that they are pacification or compromise, yes|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I don't know.  Mine isn't.|`|r8rykCkGaa	They might be but not sure what other churches are doing all that much.  My church keeps a healthy balance of singing, teaching, preaching, worship, prayer, offering, etc.  My pastor's sister is very good with the entertainment part and does a big play and musical for both Easter and Christmas every year.  Most of my relatives & a few friends have seen the Christmas specials which are like professional.  The pastor claims that most newcomers come to the Singing Christmas Tree first before coming on a regular basis.  But, other than this, we keep a balance and not too much entertainment.  We have a new sanctuary now that seats 3000.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Pssst!    You're not supposed to use the "C" word.    And I don't mean "church".|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Yes, I do believe that, especially in moving away from the hymns because "no one likes them, they are dull".|`|FBrwlhPtaa	Blondie is sooooo right! The pastors now adays are so worried about offending others that they will not preach the FULL gospel.|`|TMb076n6aa	We dont we worship in Spirit and in truth. True worship to God is from the heart it is NOT about self otherwise it would be tainted.   I dance at conferences and preach on worship and as a worshipper it is NOT  a show.     This is what we will be doing for ALL eternity and this is the training ground for heavenly worship.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Yes! It's called compromising.|`|ch9ipCTKaa	Absolutely, especially those that provide live entertainment like bands on stage, those that have women pastors etc and in doing so put modern cultural beliefs above the Word of God and many more examples.    However, the majority of these gatherings do not really count as "Churches" as the Bible defines them, rather they are cults gathered around their original members trading on the name of Jesus Christ, not the Churches built on the foundation of the Apostles and prophets.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Sure, it's in response to people that say, "I just don't get anything out of going to church".  You're not supposed to - you are GIVING something - worship to God - it isn't for YOUR edification!|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	Sadly, yes.  Many are wishy-washy, weak kneed churches who won't preach the whole counsel of God cause they are afraid of offending the sinners.  We are all sinners and need to hear "thus saith the Lord God" at church, not I'm ok, you're ok and live any way you want to.  Sin always requires a price, it cost Jesus His life.|`|z74a7wvlaa	yeah, the American way; their lives is not complete, unless being superficially entertained of no limit and forgot they are in the House of God.

He was not that skinny before he fasted for many days and nights.  Jesus' face as it is popularly being drawn and sculpted to day may not be his true face because it is more of a typical European or Roman face.|`|W3GC6aBMaa	Nobody can really prove if Buddha was fat or skinny; similarly, some Jehovah witnesses pointed out to me, in their magazine Watchtower, that Jesus is depicted with somatic characteristics typical of a man from the North, like Norway or Sweden; when in fact people from the Middle East would be a lot more dark-skinned and would keep his hair shorter; and I know this is true, because I know both people from the North and people from the Middle East. If he was looking like he is depicted, the magazine goes on, he would have stirred suspicion and marvel, while in the Bible is clear that he was seen as a normal man. But we don't know, maybe he was looking like nordic but nobody wouldn't notice, since the genetic has been discovered several centuries later. All this, however, could be seen in a spiritual way: the images are just symbols, not reflecting reality. But then why so much extremism in the literality or not of so many other parts of the Bible? Sorry for talking about Jesus, but I think is a very similar story to the one for Buddha, and could entirely be applied to your case..|`|hnhb119Laa	In India, Buddha is depicted as youthful and thin.  The fat Buddha is the Chinese "happy Buddha" depiction of him in his later years.|`|BABcrdMKaa	Here:    http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read...    each depiction of the buddha has a different meaning|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	The fat buddha is just one of the Buddhas.  There are many but that is certainly the most well known.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	There are different incarnations of the Buddha.|`|7pBjLKIjaa	Buddha was skinny and is usually depicted as such.     The fat guy you're thinking of isn't Buddha at all. He's a Chinese monk called "Budai" or "Hotei."|`|sziO5hK7aa	coz he looks much happier and content!|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Because those statues are not the Buddha.  Non-Buddhists get this wrong all the time.  Buddha was an ascetic; he would not have been fat.  My sister's a Buddhist, and she gave up a long time ago trying to explain this to people.  They know what they think they know, period.    On the other hand, Jesus most likely was not tall, blonde and blue-eyed, yet it doesn't seem to bother most Christians that he's depicted so inaccurately.    (Come on, the guy was a Middle-Eastern Semite.  How many of them look like that?)|`|W0rcm3awaa	There are two Buddhas who are typically depicted. For you see the term Buddha is just sanskrit for awake, it is a title denoting one has achieved enlightenment so not all buddhas are the same buddha.    The historical Buddha -Shakyamuni Buddha of whom you are referring to as skinny is often depicted, you can see him many places. However there is a fat buddha, or rather Hotei a chinese fish merchant, who appears more aesthetically pleasing because of his fat and jolly nature. It might be easy to make a connection from him to a Santa Claus like figure in the west which is why they use him so frequently, not to mention fat and happy is more enticing than skinny and contemplative.    So this is why you might see Hotei more than Shakyamuni.|`|wnGpAVGFaa	In some cultures, it is a sign of prosperity and wisdom to be slightly overweight.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	How do you know he was skinny?

JMOLRKRraa	The Spirit is in us. God wrote the law in our hearts, now that he got the Holy Spirit into the believer. The Spirit now leads and I, the believer follows. You desire the things of the spirit more than the things of the flesh, that is the new desire of your heart. A new heart placed within you, alive, new, living.|`|95be5639aed6aa784e4750dbb0a7e356aa	Rom 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to Spirit.   Rom 8:2  For the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus set me free from the law of sin and of death.   Rom 8:3  For the Law being powerless, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,   Rom 8:4  so that the righteous demand of the Law might be fulfilled in us, those not walking according to flesh, but according to Spirit.     It helps to keep this verse in context. Christ was the fulfillment of the law, in all its aspects. We walk in the Spirit if we are truly saved and born anew. What laws are the Christian to follow? The laws of Christ.    Mat 22:36  Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?   Mat 22:37  And Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind."   Mat 22:38  This is the first and great commandment.   Mat 22:39  And the second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."    Mat 22:40  On these two commandments all the Law and the Prophets hang.     Rom 10:4  For Christ is the end of Law for righteousness to everyone that believes.     Gal 6:2  Bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.|`|rtFkwelQaa	What is walking in the Spirit?  It is having the character or the fruit of God.  The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, patience, forgiving, meekness, humbleness, temperance.|`|XSh0u9Kwaa	Rom 7:14  For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin.    We must watch ourselves lest we forget the eternal covenant YHVH made with the children of Israel and those joined to them, for He is a jealous Elohim and a consuming fire.    Deu 4:23  "So watch yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which He made with you, and make for yourselves a graven image in the form of anything against which the LORD your God has commanded you.  Deu 4:24  "For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.    1 Chr 16:15  Remember His covenant forever, The word which He commanded to a thousand generations,  1 Chr 16:16  The covenant which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac.  1 Chr 16:17  He also confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel as an everlasting covenant,      We shall accept the covenant with the God of Israel and keep the commandments of His Torah. Or choose to be in covenant with the sun god and baal worship, we cannot serve both.    1 Ki 18:21  And Elijah came near to all the people and said, "How long will you hesitate between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him." But the people did not answer him a word.      Luke 1:68  "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people,|`|AA10471892	Again... the distinction between "fulfilling" the law in the spirit, versus "keeping" the law in the letter.    Jesus "fulfilled" the law when, on sabbaths, he healed people, despite the FACT that he broke the sabbath law in the letter.    If you insist on "keeping" the law, then there will be times you neglect to "fulfill" the law spiritually by failing to demonstrate proper love under the circumstances.      Can new wine (read, covenant) be placed in the old wineskin (old covnenant) and both not be compromised?  Can you put a patch of new material on an old garment, and not end up with another rend?    You want desperately to keep both covenants, and God will not have it.  One is either bound to Christ, or they are bound to the old covenant under these circumstances.  God is a jealous God, btw.  He won't have you serving two masters.  This is spiritual adultery and spiritual idolatry we are talking about.

Allah is the best of deceivers Sura 3:54    Your Allah is Satan.

Why would so many be willing to lay down their lives for Christ without seeing so much as one miracle? Believing or not believing is not up to us, it is work of God. He gives the faith to believe. There were many messiah-like figures around at that time, ever heard of any of them? They all died out and their followers as well, yet Christianity remains. We believe because God gives us the faith to believe.    Mat 16:15  He said to them, But you, whom do you say Me to be?   Mat 16:16  And answering, Simon Peter said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.   Mat 16:17  And answering, Jesus said to him, Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah, for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in Heaven.|`|74lYDU79aa	Sure, there are cults all around us.

38vza5Gxaa	answer: Thalia is incorrect. Homosexuality wasn't a capital offense in Northern traditions and cultures.  As long as the family line continued, "special friendships" weren't frowned upon - in other words, get married and have your other relationship as long as all parties agreed.      For warriors, being seen as the submissive in a same-sex male relationship was frowned upon but not condemned.    http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/gayvik.s...

wxBFZ41Taa	Catholic interest groups are not against stem cell research, they are against embryonic stem cell research. There is a big difference. Catholics encourage and support adult stem cell research, and there have been many gains in these areas.     As far as supporting my belief that embryonic stem cell research is wrong, I do the following:    Vote pro-life   March every year at the pro-life march  Donate money to pro-life groups  Research the information available and keep up with current progress  I do not patronize anti-life companies, those who support abortion or embryonic stem cell research.    ADDED: To Alex - the majority of pro-life supporters do not attack abortion doctors, or commit violence. In any "cause" there are fringe type people that are attracted. They do no support the cause so much as they enjoy being fanatical. They do not represent the core beliefs or practices of the pro-life movement. When I attended the always peaceful pro-life march in DC a few years ago, a small group of about 5 people were promoting the justice of killing abortion doctors. Out of 200,000 some people there, 5 of them were nut cases. All of us who passed by shook our heads in shame and disbelief...obviously murdering anyone is NOT pro-life.|`|Q2aikWjUaa	Abortion    http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/pict...|`|0JE41mXsaa	I agree with misty0408.

In the bible, it states we should convert others but it also says not to hurt anybody in any type of way, whether it be through mocking or calling each other names.

Atheists who you meet online are very different from those that I know personally.  The online crowd is obnoxious and has no respect for others' beliefs.  They call religion a form of mental illness and equate the teaching of religious belief to our children with child abuse.  They apparently won't be happy until there is no religion at all, which makes them religious disciples themselves, only pushing a different set of beliefs.    Christians can certainly be annoying to those who don't have a belief; I understand that.    But if their tactics aren't good, at least their motivations are.  Christians don't choose Christianity because it sounds like a good religion for them to follow.  Christianity chooses Christians -- that is, Christians are overwhelmed by the sense of truth in the message of Christianity, and attempt to change themselves (often with limited success) to conform to the Christian belief.    One of those truths that Christians believe is that there are eternal consequences for all of us, be they good or bad.  Christians want to share what they have and help others make what they believe is a decision with eternal ramifications.    If you heard a story about a Christian who stood in front of a burning building and ignored the cries of a child inside, you'd be right to be outraged.  The Christian believes that there really is a burning building and a people that need rescue, and their motivation is to help provide a means for that rescue.    I realize that you may not see the burning building; that's not the point.  The point is that human decency and Christian love compel Christians to at least try to do what they can to help others avoid the fate that Christians sincerely believe awaits them.    It's certainly better than the Muslim method of killing the unbelievers.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	The bible specifically prohibits that.  To not push the cult on others is a SIN.

As a soldier in the US Army I am a proud man and I believe soldiers and the US should be held to a higher standard.  Torturing prisoners not only puts mental strain on the prisoners but on our men as well.  Trust me we have enough to worry about.  Iraq is not what everyone makes it out to be.

But what if someone had kidnapped my daughter? What if we'd captured him and he refused to tell me where she was? I have to confess, I don't know what I would do. It's a little harder to be civilized when the life of someone you love might be at stake.

The Holy Bible is my code of conduct. Faith, prayer, and the Word are my weapons of warfare. I have been taught by the Holy Spirit, trained by experience, tried by adversity and tested by fire. I am a volunteer in this army, and I am enlisted for eternity. I will either retire in this army at the Rapture or die in this army; but I will not get out, sell out, be talked out, or pushed out. I am faithful, reliable, capable and dependable. If my God needs me, I am there. If He needs me in the Sunday school, to teach the children, work with the youth, help adults or just sit and learn, He can use me because I am there! I am a soldier. I am not a baby. I do not need to be pampered, petted, primed up, pumped up, picked up or pepped up. I am a soldier. No one has to call me, remind me, write me, visit me, entice me, or lure me. I am a soldier. I am not a wimp. I am in place, saluting my King, obeying His orders, praising His name, and building His kingdom! No one has to send me flowers, gifts, food, cards, candy or give me handouts. I do not need to be cuddled, cradled, cared for, or catered to. I am committed. I cannot have my feelings hurt bad enough to turn me around. I cannot be discouraged enough to turn me aside. I cannot lose enough to cause me to quit. When Jesus called me into this army, I had nothing. If I end up with nothing, I will still come out ahead. I will win. My God has and will continue to supply all of my needs. I am more than a conqueror. I will always triumph. I can do all things through Christ. Devils cannot defeat me. People cannot disillusion me. Weather cannot weary me. Sickness cannot stop me. Battles cannot beat me. Money cannot buy me. Governments cannot silence me and hell cannot handle me. I am a soldier. Even death cannot destroy me. For when my commander calls me from this battlefield, He will promote me to Captain and then allow me to rule with Him. I am a soldier in the army, and I'm marching claiming victory. I will not give up. I will not turn around. I am a soldier, marching heaven bound. Here I stand!                 Will you stand with me? Guess what? If you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior you're already enlisted! Question is, which part of the service are you in:     1. Active Duty: Serving the Lord faithfully, daily, and on duty     24-7?     2.      Reserve status: Serving only when called upon or twice a  year, Christmas and Easter?     3.      Guard status: Backing up the Active Duty group?        Or;     4.      AWOL! Absent without the Lord?              Steven|`|r8qJecrMaa	I've watched your TV stations!

It's been shown that torture is actually extremely unreliable as a motivator for gathering accurate information.  Sadly most of our Armed Forces gets all of their education from episodes of 24 rather than reality.    No, torture should be liberally and widely applied in the USA, but only on anyone who relies on votes for their jobs.  At random intervals, every elected official should be rounded up, put in stockades in the town square, and every citizen who stops by should be handed a cattle prod.  Popular politicians, who actually benefit their constituents instead of lobbyist interests would get off lightly, while the most corrupt would tend to be justly punished.

If a law is passed that culls the rights or liberties of nonbelievers or someone who disagrees with them, they are just supposed to "shut up and deal with it."  If laws are passed that protects or acknowledges the rights of others whom they disagree with, then the government officials are activists...hence the pseudo-intellectual drivel about "activist judges" doing awful things like "legislating from the bench."

Roe vs. Wade is based on US Supreme Court interpretation of existing law, and thus significantly justified. On the other hand, no group should have their legal standing decided by referendum in a republic (such as both California and the US). That sets the precedent that the majority can decide to take away any right they choose from any minority, which is dangerous. This is why the California Supreme Court will overturn Prop H8.    Thus, though I support your basic point, there is a clear difference between how the two situations were decided, and therefore a difference in how they can be treated in public.    edit: 'Sup, good to see you back, though this does spark my fear of zombies.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	> Why doesnt the religious right simply "shut up and deal with" the fact that abortion is legal in this country?

And she doesn want to think of one of her good friends as being a bible-burning rug-muncher.  You know?  I'm not saying that's what lesbians are, that's ridiculous. I prefer the term tile-licker when refering to myself....lol!  All I'm saying is don't push her, it will make her uncomfortable and you may wind up losing a friend.  Just keep doing what your doing and don't worry about having to convince her, eventually she'll see that not all gay people are what the bias makes them out to be.

RC5RAzykaa	These are the closest things I could find:    Eliphaz spoke  Job 5:22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.     again Eliphaz spoke     (THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONE YOU SEEK)  Job 22:19  The righteous see [it], and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.     This is from the mouth of Elihu  Job 33:26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.    The word "laughter" does not occur in the book of Job, at least not in the King James Version.  Or at least not that my search engine could find.    The following are all the scriptures in which I found "laughter"    Psalm 126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.     Proverbs 14:15 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth [is] heaviness.     Ecclesiastes 2:2 I said of laughter, [It is] mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?     Ecclesiastes 7:3 Sorrow [is] better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.     Ecclesiastes 7:6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so [is] the laughter of the fool: this also [is] vanity.     Ecclesiastes 10:19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all [things].     James 4:9   Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	Well done you, both for your effort in French and your musical objectives. When I was your age I ran to the piano each time I needed a break from my studies, and I never had enough of it.    OK. With regard to your sentence with "amliorer", it is your technique that has improved, not you. The French expression is either "Ma technique s'est beaucoup amliore" or "j'ai fait beaucoup de progrs".    "Vouloir" calls for the subjunctive afterwards, which you may not have learnt  yet. I have corrected it, but if  you feel uneasy about using it, you could change the sentence to "ma mre, qui joue trs bien, voulait naturellement me voir jouer aussi bien qu'elle et m'a encourage".     "Sensationnel" has two "n"s.   "Passe-temps" has a "s" at the end.    Your bit about wanting to play more follows the sentence about your playing with your friend and it looks as if it is playing with her that you want to do more often. You could change it to "J'aimerais passer plus de temps au piano mais pour le moment je dois me concentrer sur mes tudes et prparer mes examens, et je n'en ai pas le temps".          Je joue du piano depuis l'age de six ans mais j'ai fait beaucoup de progrs depuis. J'aime jouer de la musique moderne, parce que je peux chanter aussi. J'ai commenc parce que ma mre joue  trs bien et donc, naturellement, elle voulait que je fasse de mme. C'tait une bonne dcision. Je trouve ?a sensationnel!  Normalement, je joue toute seule, mais j'adore faire un duo de piano avec ma copine. J'aimerais faire ceci plus souvent, mais maintenant, je n'en ai pas le temps parce que je dois faire mes tudes et prparer mes examens.  Pour jouer du piano, il faut travailler dur et prendre des le?ons de musique. Malheureusement pour beaucoup de monde ?a co?te trop cher.    mon avis, c'est un bon passe-temps parce que c'est trs relaxant et cratif. A l'avenir, je voudrais continuer de faire de la musique et  peut-tre en faire ma carrire.    GOOD LUCK!|`|8jfP349iaa	Je joue du piano depuis l'age de six ans mais j'ai fait beaucoup de progrs depuis. J'aime jouer de la musique moderne, parce que je peux chanter aussi.

People are being born and dying everyday.|`|0vmQNf0oaa	Oh, the population control crowd is in control now. Some loony liberal already suggested this week that families be limited to 2 kids.    And Obama is funding abortions around the wold with our tax dollars.    I think all the loony tunes should move to China where there is a 1 kid rule.

Birth control and/or abstinence should solve the problem.    PS: Abortion should not, and need not, be a part of population control.|`|AA11923447	Rather than getting rid of myself, I have simply chosen not to breed. I do believe that overpopulation is a problem, so I do not wish to add to it. It's not a matter of killing anyone off, but rather of using scientific methods to ensure that the population doesn't continue to spiral out of control needlessly. There is no logical sense in overbreeding when we've known for so many years how to prevent it.

The science must divert it's attention towards spirituality so that they can find more facts about souls, spirits and all invisible elements of this world.

wB3AbJyLaa	Do you remember where you were during the final days of March 1997? That was when thirty-nine members of a group called Heaven's Gate dressed in identical black outfits, lay down on identical metal beds, and methodically killed themselves. The members of Heaven's Gate had been told that death would be the portal taking them to another life in a galaxy far away. This idea sounds silly to reasonable people, but for thirty-nine people who died because they believed this lie, the outcome was tragic. Today many people believe that all religions teach the same thing, or that they are all equal, or that it doesn't really matter what someone believes. But the tragedy of Heaven's Gate reveals that it does matter what someone believes. In some cases it's a matter of life and death. If you aren't convinced, check the entries on Jonestown, the Order of the Solar Temple, and some of the other deadly cults found online. In most cases people don't die from believing a lie, but their lives aren't all they could be. In the case of some controlling religious groups, people sacrifice their money, their relationships, and their free will for a self-proclaimed guru's promise of salvation.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Cults are dangerous because in the end the people that believe wrongly and were against Christ will be eternally separated from God.

AA11796124	I'm hoping your boyfriend is a devout Catholic, which means you shouldn't count on sex before marriage.    Frankly, if you've only been dating for three weeks, no matter his stance on the issue, you two haven't had the time to get to know each other well enough to consider sex under any circumstances.|`|AA10096992	I was Catholic until 12 or so, and I hadn't done anything up to that point.

The priest rolled his eyes and laughed and said, "In this day and age, I doubt very many virgins are walking down the aisle."
5N3odm3Qaa	Your opinions are not exactly in line with reality.    Not everyone drinks, smokes, lives in the city, and eats greasy food four times a day. Many people are excellent donors despite their weight or minor vices. Don't forget that the lungs, heart, and liver are not the only organs people need. Kidneys, corneas, and skin are three popular organs in demand as well.    Also bear in mind that bad things happen to good organ donors. Following a stroke, hypoxia can ruin every vital organ in a matter of moments.    I'm not doing anything to make sure my organs are viable for donation. What I am doing is not smoking so I don't get lung cancer and I'm not drinking enough to tax my liver even a fraction of what it can handle. So don't be so judgmental. Or is that just a compulsive part of your religious upbringing?    I'm an atheist. I was raised by two non-religious/atheist parents (one formerly Jewish, one formerly Christian).|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	I dont drink or smoke.

eCp0ERSCaa	Well, it was a group called the Ebionites, who were probably connected to the Essenes, but to what extent is unknown. But, yes, they were persecuted for their insistence on the teachings of Jesus over the teachings of Paul the Liar. They were probably the remnants of James' and Peter's followers in Jerusalem, who left Jerusalem for a variety of reasons, not the least of which would be the destruction of the temple in 70 CE.    ADDENDUM: Well, I was merely quoting a source when I called him a liar, above. However, I do agree that Paul was in fact a liar. He claims to be a Pharisee, yet none of his writings are Pharisaic in nature. In fact, he writes exactly like a poor imitation of a pharisee. He also claims to have worked for the Priesthood in Jerusalem. Either this is completely untrue, or his claim to be a pharisee is. No pharisee in first century Palestine would have associated with the Temple hierarchy, whom they viewed as corroborators and only marginally Jewish. Paul clearly does not comprehend Pharisee-ism. I could go on with his lies, but this should suffice.    2ND ADDENDUM: First of all, I am historically correct, so it's not an issue that the "things I say aren't true." Secondly, what is there to fear? I am safe from christian retribution because of the society I live in, as well as the anonymity of the internet. Lastly, divine retribution is not real, so there is nothing to fear from that, either.|`|OxuLUCX9aa	The Essences escaped the 70 ad Roman invasion of Jerusalem. So how could they have been wiped out.  Please go learn correct history.  You always come on here with these strange questions when you don't even know what your talking about. The reason Romans invaded Jerusalem was because it was a prophecy Yahweh set against ancient Hebrews because of their sinning. The ancient Hebrews never worshiped some pagan god which Paul created named Jesus. The ancient Hebrews worshiped Yahweh who gave them laws to follow. They didn't do anything they wanted like the New Testament says one can. The Old Testament Hebrews' Yahweh is the real God.|`|ch9ipCTKaa	The essene were a Jewish cult that lived in isolated groups and followed their own brand of Judaism, they even wrote that upon the coming of the messiah they would all sit at table together with the messiah at the head of the table after He wiped out their Roman oppressors.     When Jesus didn't fulfill their plan, they rejected Him and all His followers, not only Paul, except a small handful that may have converted. Ultimately they were wiped out by the Romans in the battle at Masada.    The Ebionites were another cult altogether, they tried to combine Christianity with those Jewish practices they were both man-made and out dated with the coming of Christ.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	how you doin loj? haven't seen you in a while. go find Jesus. read Acts 5:29 and think about you idol worship of paulie|`|AA11598520	Yeah, that's it exactly. You guessed it.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	I think it had a lot more to do with the fact that the Roman Empire didn't see a place for a bunch of fruitcakes living in the wilderness...add to that the fact that they had strict admonitions against sex, and that would tend to make any social network disappear after a generation or so...I didn't even realized they knew who Paul was, let alone know him well enough to call him a liar...    I guess you learn something new everyday - you got a weblink for this new info?    EDIT:  Why do you seem so intent on making God out to be your personal superhero (or perhaps, personal super-villain is more apt), at the ready to destroy any and all those who take exception to your imaginative concretization of the Christian Mythology?  Are you bullied a lot in your environment?  Psychologically speaking, you seem to have a lot of issues with being made to feel powerless, and you compensate that with an unhealthy obsession about others (especially if they disagree with you, taking the time to correct you with some basic historical facts) being tormented by a Divine God.  Even your pathetic "aren't you afraid...?" (your most over-used epithat) screams volumes of what is going on in your mind - hoping the terror you feel at questioning the narrow, shallow confines of a discordant belief system would be felt by others, and utter confusion when others reject it as an obvious attempt at manipulation.
lcvhhGjpaa	The reasoning behind this is that basically the afterlife is nothing more than a self invented survival instinct.  We create an afterlife because we want to believe that we can transcend and survive everything, even death.      You would need to have some logic in the first place, then maybe you could have worked that out.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	99% of the responses I get from Christians when I tell them I'm an atheist center around "Don't you want to live forever?"    :)|`|gGmMw2vDaa	It is about fear of death.

(which ive never actually heard an athiest make boefore to my recollection)|`|6zo7eKT5aa	Well, Hugo. Since you want to live forever, I'd say you can't bear to die. Religion teaches you to do good to avoid punishment rather than doing good because it is the right thing to do for society and humanity. I'd say that's fear mongering. We don't lie. We disagree with your logic.|`|iYEWbE23aa	Lmao, you answered your own question.  I guess we could easily see how you could believe in 'a' deity.|`|Om2xjC08aa	If you fear flying, and you take some pills to calm you down, then you don't fear flying anymore right? But that means that the pills were very much about fear of flying.   In the same manner religion can certainly have the function that they can take away your fear of death. (Although it has to be said that people who are religious can also fear hell - which makes death worse)  Anyway, not all atheists would say this, and I personally think it's an oversimplification. People have very different reasons for being religious... In fact most are religious simply because of their parents were.|`|mAjyNjV5aa	I am a believer (Christianity)  But I am not ashamed to say that I was brainwashed into this religion.   Why?  Because although I can't prove Christ due to no prayers being answered, even though the Bible supports prayers Matthew 21 verse 22.  I still believe!  I realise that it was due to my fear of going to hell, and nothing more.  If you train a child to believe in Buddha the chances are that he will not turn from that faith.  It is all about fear and punishment or why woudl I still be a Christian when Christ don't seem to answer my prayers... and always in faith!!!|`|QVO9b0a8aa	Obviously, religion is meant to keep you from being scared of death, by saying there's an afterlife.    Lets take it this way: Imagine there is no afterlife. You would be scared of dying, right? Of course you would be. Now, imagine if I came to you, and I told you that there was a place you would go after you died to live forever in paradise. Obviously you would be no longer scared of death, and you would feel much better. This is why Atheists say religion is founded on the fear of death - because it is. Religion is made to make you feel better about death, so that it can control you.    Take, for an example: What if I added something to that story? What if I said there was an omniscient being who sent you there? Well, you would of course, believe the omniscient being exists, simply because at the time, it seems like a logical explanation to you. If I told you that, if you didn't obey the omniscient being, you would not go to the afterlife, but rather, to another plane of existence where you are tortured, you would follow the omniscient being's laws in fear of this hell.    So, you believe this being exists, you believe in heaven, hell, and whatnot. So you frantically follow all his rules, in hopes to go to heaven, not hell. However, meanwhile, I'm sitting in my house, laughing at you, because I just told you a fairy tale in an attempt to play off the natural human fear of death to make you act to the standards I want you to act to.    And that's pretty much how religion starts. People use your fear against you, and invent an imaginary story as an explanation, and then use this story to control you, so that you do what they want you to do.|`|cfda9b5d078d37da24e0ff1809dee8d5aa	You answered your own question--you have "found" God, and no longer fear death because you believe that you will live forever.|`|nbLqaRyMaa	dude amen to all these comments.    And your edit right there. Your saying our logic is shown to be a lie but you believe that adam and eve listened to a talking snake who told them to eat an apple from a forbidden tree.    whos logic seems alil skewed?|`|7pBjLKIjaa	It is not the fear of death. It is the fear of what comes after - the possibility of ending up in Hell. That is one of the main driving force behind conversion and retention into a religion.    "What dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil.."
YIAZmSW7aa	If it makes people feel less alienated from the comforts of religion to say that everything is god, then I see no problem with it.  And I guess when you think about how fascinated I am that we do exist in the first place, I guess you could say everything is a miracle.  But then, what's a miracle?  It loses its meaning.|`|ngew4AWSaa	"Pantheism is just sexed up atheism" - Richard Dawkins.    A pantheist's idea of god does not match that of a theists. Essentailly, Pantheism IS atheism, plus some extra poetic statements.    I also think that pantheists referring to "God" and "Religion" in the way they do can very much confuse people. Look what happened to Einstein. When he said   "Religion without science is blind. Science without religion is lame.", he was in no way calling for a merging of science and religion, as many theists has claimed. He was moreso using the word "Religion" as a metaphor, he was talking about how science without ethics was pointless.    So yeah, I don't think Pantheists should talk about God in the way they do.|`|Q8coTUJfaa	Some pantheists make the allowance for there being some form of intelligence within/behind existence... quite a difference.    For some people pantheism is like deism, but opposed to a deity that dissapeared it is a deity that is ever present and everywhere but still does not have any intent of specific intervention or any human qualities that the run of the mill deities have.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	I don't think it would change much of anything if we shifted.    The only real difference between Scientific (or natural) Pantheism and atheism is that Scientific Pantheists like nature a lot and tend to be more environmental.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	The statements are equivalent.

This doesn't matter much--I only know that atheism can't be reconciled with a belief that everything is god.  Atheists believe that nothing is god.  That seems to be the polar opposite.|`|pYimIJAWaa	It's not a matter of linguistics, but of faith.|`|847ab32dc15c849d022c11323ad7db39aa	Pantheists believe in God and atheists don't. They are both simply beliefs about a deity, not organized religions. And who says that pantheists don't pray, believe in supernatural intervention, etc?|`|WbaN6osZaa	every event is a miracle|`|KVirP3bsaa	I think pantheists use a strange definition of god. Words are used to communicate, and their use of the word god is a very easily misunderstood because it is uncommon. I see no problem with having reverence for nature, but it seems counterproductive to call it "god".|`|6aIuZZi7aa	Where did you hear that pantheists consider every act to be a miracle? Pantheists do not believe in miracles.  The very definition of "miracle" indicates intervention from a deity which pantheism rejects. And any debate of pantheism versus atheism is bound to be a boring one. I suspect that each are tolerant of the other as they both reject belief in deities.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	6 of one, half dozen of the other.  Second verse, same as the first.    I think there are positive consequences because the difference in language at least creates discussion.  But I think it's just a matter of semantics.|`|JXnyZ8rIaa	When we play with semantics like that it becomes more of a "glass half full" "glass half empty" world view.  In reality saying that "God" consists of everything there is boils down to saying that there is no singular deity.  Dawkins called it "sexed up Atheism" basically saying it was a more palatable form.  Could taking that approach make Atheists more accepted?  Sure.  But we Atheists are not known for padding reality in pretty niceties...
N28zLxtpaa	Because it's all a bunch of bull****.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Why does the bible god hold his fallen creatures to a higher moral standard than he himself exhibits?    He doesn't - of course.  Quite the contrary, God *defines* the moral standard.      2) Love your enemies    God's only real "enemy" is wickedness (sin).      3) bless those who curse you     Maybe you didn't notice, but those who curse God are normally just as blessed - if not more so - as those who praise his name.  The bible addresses this specifically.      4) About hell...    God is both merciful and just.  God is not harmed by people, and people - and their lives - do not belong to us and are not ours to judge.  So, when a fellow human "offends" us, we are to forgive them - just as God forgives all of us (and we all sin, so offending him).  However, when dealing with God we are dealing with a much higher standard.  God is not a sinner and does not *need* to forgive sin in others.  He is not dealing with equals when dealing with humans - he is dealing with his creation, and he *knows* the goodness and the wickedness we have - *all* of it.    God does not judge humans by what a human sees.  God's judgment is just - ours is superficial.    SO, if God were ever to run into another all-powerful creator God who is good and just and merciful as he is, the standard that you mention might apply.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|AA11992885	God never said love your enemy, jesus said that........God said to kill your enemy    and HE never said to bless those who curse you, again, that was jesus, God said to take no action against them, not to bless them and certainly not to curse them, don't do anything    idiots like you are just looking to b*tch abut something, you don't even care if it is right or wrong, you just b*tch
wwdllMzYaa	for me  love is, knowing someone, wanting to know them  enjoying them, the good, a d the bad, wanting to help them, help make them happy, make their life better, not to see then hurt, you feel hurt when they hurt, you need to be near them, need to know them , want to understand them  you try, you change, you adapt, you listen, you learn, you are willing to do what it takes,   but, you also know when to draw the line, because love is also being able to stop soemone doing things that hurt you or them|`|D9lMg7A2aa	The recognition of the aspect of God in another person.

I do see in the Book of Revelation that it is phrased as "overcoming".  The Lord states that we must overcome as he did.  I suppose that overcoming requires something of us beyond just saying "I believe".

La teoria de la Evolucin sostiene que tanto monos como humanos descendemos de un antepasado comn del cual nos separamos y evolucionamos cada uno por su lado.    En los primeros das de la evolucin, los creacionistas usaron el argumento del mono para ridiculizar a los evolucionistas. Hubo un celebre debate en que un clerigo le increp a un evolucionista si su abuelo era mono y el respondi algo as como que prefera que fuera mono a ser descendiente de su familia.    Estas criticas e insultos quedaron en el imaginario popular y han llegado desde el siglo XIX hasta nuestros das y todava hay personas que creen ingenuamente que la evolucin dice o dijo que el hombre desciende del mono, cuando no es cierto.    As que paradojicamente tanto creacionistas como evolucionistas coinciden en ese punto. El hombre no desciende del mono. Pero la mayoria de ellos no saben la historia real y discuten por uno de los pocos puntos que tienen en comn.

When we are led by the Spirit then we are under God's control.  So if we are in the flesh we are on our own if we are in the Spirit God is with us.  So it depends on our own actions and decisions.  God bless you.|`|AA11511615	I try to fit my day around God/Spirit, but to answer this question honestly, I can't say that I always do.  Sadly, a lot of times, I find myself fitting God into my day.  Your question really made me think though, and I thank you for that.|`|UWlRLXvRaa	God fills both my day and my body. While I set aside specific time to spend with Him daily, I'm still in the process of learning how to abide in Him throughout the day, being sensitive to what He is saying and doing. Of course, He is always able, and has my permission, to "trump" my schedule or "butt in". And He does at times!      An example of this, some years back while I was cleaning the kitchen of a Missionary Training School, I was attending. It was my job to clean the kitchen/dining room. Such a boring job! Then one day while I was getting ready to clean the floors I suddenly had this idea pop into my head about what to use to clean them. They were black-streaked, old dirty floors. So based on that thought that came to me suddenly, I mixed two cleaning solutions together and mopped the floors. Would you believe it- they shined just like you'd see on T.V. ! They looked brand new! I had cleaned them before but they never turned out that well! My boss even noticed them and told me that he had never seen the floors that bright and clean in all his years there. Now I don't have a doctorate in cleaning solutions/chemicals/house products but the Holy Spirit knew what would work the best and it did! I share this to say that God wants to participate with us in the "non-spiritual" tasks we do daily. He wants to make life fun!      I'm learning that He is my guide. He knows the terrian better than I do and He knows where He wants to take me. He's with me in every valley and ditch; field and hill and mountain top! He's with me when it's cold or hot, raining or breezy. All I have to do is invite Him to participate with me in that day's journey!    He is the Conductor, not me. I'm just learning to sing His song with Him! It's a song of love that has the power to bring life! I can't image a day without Him anymore!    Interesting question!|`|LO9Ukf1Raa	Hello,    Being that God is a part of my life, for me there is no way I can fit my day around him or he around me.    Example:  Recently my health has affected my work and subsequently was  let go for that reason. God certainly knew my circumstance and for that reason I put my full trust in Him for he knew what was best for me - such as allowing a temporary release from my duties so I could heal from a past of spousal abuse which has affected me to this day. Coming out of denial as to how the emotional abuse affected me, it caused major depressive disorder. In summation, He worked in my life rather than around my life.    Hope that answers your question.    Blessings,  K|`|AA11822969	God is my day. When we try and fit God into our schedule, we are going against Scripture.

12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	Earlier today, I was thinking of something that happened in the R&S forum over the weekend. It illustrates perfectly what you have asked.    A 14 year-old girl named Hannah posted with, "High Guys!! Anyone need any prayers?" She then went on to say that she felt a need to do for others, and thought that praying for anyone and everyone would be a good way to start. Would we like her to pray for us? Did we know anyone who needed prayer?    Husband, she was so sweet, so sincere, that before she was deleted, 59 people had answered. They thanked her for the concern, said how sweet they thought she was, and gave the name of someone they knew who needed prayer. Many of those to answer asked that she pray for them, and gave their request.    Now, here's where things get funky. Of those 59 to answer, 13 (myself included) were atheists. We all thanked her, and either allowed her to pray for us, or named someone for whom she could pray.    It's all in the presentation.     A teenager was able to do in one post what so many have not be able to accomplish in a lifetime. This little girl brought 60 people together with her show of caring and compassion rather than condemnation. Every one  of us could learn from her.    As our mothers always said, you catch more flies with honey....      ps. Now that I know where to find you, there will be mail forthcoming.|`|AA11124121	Ridiculously speaking, do you know anything about ahh.."Theists" beliefs?      What "hell?"  What' "eternal punishment."    I won't bother with your link..|`|TxDrVt3haa	I don't believe they care how they are viewed by heretics!!|`|TWW5DGttaa	I think they don't realize how they come across. Most religions do not. When you become to identify yourself with any group that has a specific perspective on viewing the world there is going to be similarity in language and communication, behavior, thought patterns, and values. You begin to see the rest of the world through the eyes of that group and consequentially, you cannot see yourself as you really are. Now, that being said, everyoe identifies themself with something or someone even if it's unknown or hasn't been labeled. So, wouldn't that mean no one can possibly see the world through a completely unbiased perspective. Experiences, background, external circumstances, even personality all affect the way the world is see. So, wouldn't that mean even the people who see certain people weirdos or odd, cannot truly know whether they are or not because they could be the odd ones and never really know it. So, now the question is what defines normal?

czXaUPIlaa	Humans cling to thoughts (and other mental phenomena) because this is the natural tendency of mind.     It's just how the mind works.     This natural functioning becomes habitual at a very early age. These mind-habits perpetuate afflictive impulses and actions that produce suffering.    In a very real sense, mind-habits are the manifestation of attachment and aversion (the Buddha called this "craving"). And, as you say, this  inevitably leads to dissatisfaction (dukkha) - the Second Noble Truth.    But while the mind naturally clings, we have available to us the ability to stop the clinging (the Third Noble Truth).     To stop the clinging, we follow the Eightfold Path (Fourth Noble Truth). This path results in genuine joy, wisdom, compassion and the other fruits of an awakened mind.|`|TfWIcohcaa	Why are there so many waves in the ocean when the natural state of water is calm?|`|aqJJbciQaa	A pattern of the mind cannot easily be changed.

To answer your question.    The mind is mechanical.  It sometimes is not conscious it's conscious, as our eyes take in things mechanically when they are open, as we live our lives our minds are also mechanical.    Can you open your eyes and not see what is about you?  I don't mean this question for a legally blind person who probably has more inner vision, but I mean the literal eye, can you open it and not visually take in what is seen?  Do you have to tell the eyes to see?  Do you tell the mind to think?...well sometimes we do...think, think.  But mostly it operates on autopilot.    There is no way for it not to.  It's a mechanical feature of the body and it does what it is suppose to do. Process numerous amounts of information like a super computer without any direction it works on it's own.    The mind thinks thoughts, it gives our body signals for the hands and feet to move, tells you when you are hungry, sleepy, tired, excited and so on, and it is the control center for the whole body, all day long, and sometimes even when we sleep.    There are some who can't shut their minds off.  This is why meditation is so important.  It allows the mind to rest and the spirit to take over, instead of thinking with our minds, we listen and are refreshed with our spirits.    We can either let the mind run rampant and think all kinds of random  thoughts or we can control our thinking and think upon what is enlightening, satisfying and productive.    There is productivity in our thought processes so it is important that we choose what we think upon.  Each thing that we see in this Universe gets processed in the mind and each material thing that we see in this Universe came about originally as a thought in the spiritual realm, an idea, a concept and then was produced into our reality.    The design starts in the mind.  The car design, the dress or suit, the house we want to build.....are all products of a focused mind.    And these things we must cling to because so as a man or woman  thinketh, so he (or she) becomes.    Life is fleeting, happiness is not always promised and happiness IS a state of mind....which we can choose for a moment or for eternity.|`|fbBNdmF1aa	because the human mind can sometimes be too strong  some of us feel the need to listen to their thoughts  even though they dont have a real substance  they sort of think they really do.|`|AA12059478	that's a very good question, Ian.

Dios es Omnipotente y tambin OMNISCIENTE. Sabe todo pasado, presente y futuro. Por eso, no solo dise? al ser humano tal como es, sino que tambin plane la forma de rescatarlo de las maldiciones (originado por su actitud), antes de crearlo (Efesios 1). Dios cre esos rboles deseables en el huerto, pero les prohibi comer los frutos hasta que l lo permitiera. No estoy suponiendo, Apocalipsis 21 y 22, declara que esos rboles estn presentes en el mundo futuro de los hijos de Dios y, ellos tendrn derecho a comerlos.    Tal vez, esto sea similar a muchas cosas a los que pensamos que tenemos derecho de tener, y no lo tenemos, pero lo tendremos a su debido tiempo. Dios no crea algo preciado y luego lo esconde para que nadie haga uso de l, al contrario, nos ha dado lo mejor, solo que muchas de cosas se le han dado mal uso.    Ahora, hacerlo responsable de lo ocurrido es desviar la culpa a otros como muchas veces lo hacemos. Dios nos hizo con capacidad de mejorar nuestras actitudes, nuestras cualidades y nuestro comportamiento, si no lo hacemos estaremos mal, porque algo que no se optimiza se vuelve obsoleto y muere o deja de ser til.

Cuarto, aunque te parezca increible el ejercicio te sienta bien, no te cansa (siempre y cuando no te vayas a los extremos), te relaja, por lo que te recomiendo que practiques algo de deporte.  Respecto a tu dieta, te recomendara que visites a un nutricionista, el puede notar algun deficiencia de alguna vitamina o mineral por tu crecimiento.

c6107OuEaa	La Logia Blanca     La Logia Blanca o La Gran Fraternidad Universal Blanca es formada por seres con la conciencia despierta positivamente, en infinitos grados e jerarquas, dependiendo del grado de purificacin interior, nacimiento alqumico y sacrificio por la humanidad (estos son los llamados Tres Factores de Revolucin de la Conciencia.)       Bsicamente los Tres Factores de Revolucin de la Conciencia son:    - el morir ( la eliminacin del ego a travs de la muerte mstica o psicolgica)     - el nacer, a travs de la prctica del tantrismo blanco, de la magia sexual (alquimia)     - sacrificio por la humanidad, que es ense?ar los Tres Factores de Revolucin de la Conciencia a todas las personas interesadas, sin exigir absolutamente nada a cambio.     La Logia Blanca esta constituida de Iniciados hasta Dioses, que gobiernan y sostienen todo el Universo firme en su marcha. Estos seres ofician en Templos de Sabidura que existen en las dimensiones superiores de la naturaleza. Podemos citar antiguos templos mayas, nrdicos, orientales, etc., que existan en el mundo fsico y debido al desarrollo desmesurado de la bestialidad y del intelectualismo sin espiritualidad, sumergieron en la cuarta dimensin, en el mundo jinas. Tambin existe, en estado de jinas, la cuidad divina de Shambala donde viven grandes Maestros que todava conservan su cuerpo fsico inmortal de millones de a?os. De acuerdo con su jerarqua estos seres pueden manifestarse en todas las dimensiones del Universo, tener poderes sobre toda la creacin, ilimitada sabidura, amor, justicia, fuerza, misericordia, etc.     Por sus respectivos grados de conciencia los llamamos de magos blancos, ngeles, arcngeles, querubines, serafines, virtudes, dominaciones, tronos, etc. La Logia Blanca trabaja intensamente para mostrar el camino y guiar a todas las personas que buscan la verdadera evolucin, o sea, revolucin espiritual interior, para que estas tambin vengan a hacer parte de la Gran Fraternidad Universal Blanca.          La Logia Negra        La Logia Negra es la antitesis, el opuesto de la Venerable Logia Blanca. Luego sus miembros son las entidades tenebrosas que despiertan o estn despertando en el mal y para el mal. Tambin poseen diversos grados y poderes, dependiendo de su perversidad y desenvolvimiento negativo. Se manifiestan en el mundo fsico (aquellos que poseen cuerpo fsico) y en las regiones inferiores de la naturaleza:     - en la regin inferior de la 4o dimensin viven las brujas y brujos, son los jinas ******.     - en la regin inferior del mundo astral (5o dimensin) viven los magos ******.     - en la regin inferior del mundo mental (5o dimensin) viven los demonios ms perversos.     En las regiones superiores de la 4o y 5o dimensiones y en las dems dimensiones de la naturaleza las entidades tenebrosas no tienen acceso. La Logia Negra trabaja adorando y fortaleciendo el ego animal, bien como practicando el tantrismo *****.     No hay duda de que los orgasmos mltiplos de tntricos ******, en vez de despertar la Kundalini o prana sagrado, para hacerlo subir por el canal medular, estimulan y desarrollan el abominable rgano Kundartiguador, convirtindose, entonces, el aspirante en una personalidad tenebrosa, en un mago ***** de la peor especie.  Samael Aun Weor.       La Logia Negra trabaja con las fuerzas negativas de la naturaleza para propagar sus propsitos de maldad, crueldad, egosmo, ganancia, violencia, degeneracin moral y sexual, etc., entre los seres humanos, siendo que estos quedan ciegos y esclavizados por sus propios defectos psicolgicos, su ego, ya que son programados para eso desde que nacen y pasan toda su existencia sin remotamente sospechar lo que realmente est ocurriendo a su alrededor. Por eso, vemos concretamente en lo que se transform la humanidad y el mundo de hoy. La Logia Negra acta transgrediendo la Leyes Divinas, violando el libre arbitrio de las personas, etc. Posee tambin sus templos de magia negra en las regiones inferiores de la naturaleza y tambin en el mundo fsico. Adems de los locales donde declaradamente se practican los propsitos de la Logia Negra, existen tambin locales donde se practica de forma muy sutil, dando una falsa apariencia de local santo o sagrado. Esto se torna en algo muy peligroso, pues muchas personas buscadoras de la autntica Luz se acaban filiando a templos de magia negra disfrazados sin saber. La Logia Negra odia mortalmente la Logia Blanca, sus principios, miembros y aspirantes a miembros, pues sabe perfectamente que, despertando conciencia y ascendiendo espiritualmente, sern enemigos del mal y mucho ms poderosos que los miembros de la Logia Negra. Por eso, la Logia Negra lucha para que las personas no consigan o para desviarlas de los Tres Factores de la Revolucin de la Conciencia, la llave de todo el poder.

Z8XXiI2Baa	El billete de un dolar y sus smbolos esotericos    Es usual encontrarse con la creencia popular que dice que tener un billete de un dlar en la billetera atrae dinero. Quien se haya detenido a mirar dicho billete, podr darse cuenta de que esta creencia tiene un fundamento, ya que los smbolos esotricos que aparecen en su parte posterior son numerosos y adems sobre el nmero uno (ONE), se invoca la proteccin de Dios (in god we trust).  Comencemos por el crculo de la izquierda, que contiene una pirmide, simbolizando con su vrtice superior el punto de entrada de las energas del cosmos y su expansin hacia los distintos puntos de la base. Esto nos da la idea de un crecimiento o reproduccin de las cosas materiales (la base.) En el tringulo que se separa en la punta, el ojo de Dios, la capacidad de conectarnos con esa visin superior para permitir que todo fluya hacia nosotros.  En el crculo de la derecha, el guila simbolizando el poder, la fuerza, la capacidad de subir a lo alto para tener una visin ms global de la vida, sosteniendo en su garra izquierda 11 flechas (el 11 es un nmero maestro), y con la izquierda una rama de laurel, smbolo del xito. Su cuerpo est atravesado por un blasn de 7 rayas (7 es un nmero mgico) y por encima de su cabeza, la estrella de David de 6 puntas formada por 13 estrellas tambin de 6 puntas dispuestas en dos tringulos, uno con el vrtice hacia arriba simbolizando lo material y el otro con el vrtice hacia abajo, que implica lo que baja del cosmos.  Eso s, ya que hablamos de creencias, dicen que para tener el billete en la billetera, alguien nos lo debe haber regalado.|`|c18113f1013a7af9aea93e68bcb18434aa	Es un signo masnico con un ojo, representa el ojo de Dios que todo lo ve, representa abundancia, es lo que eran los independentistas de ese pas..los masones, por cierto todos los de Amrica latina eran masones tambin.|`|dC0mBy8baa	Nu se :=??=?=

Te amo sin saber cmo, ni cundo, ni de dnde,  te amo secretamente, sin problemas ni orgullo:  as te amo porque no se amar de otra manera,    sino as de este modo en que no soy ni eres,  tan cerca que tu mano sobre mi pecho es ma,  tan cerca que se cierran tus ojos con mi sue?o.

Hoy por ti mis miradas son dulces palabras, mi sonrisa; la pureza de tu alma. Hoy por ti un gemido es un "Por Ti Me Muero", el tiempo por ti se esconde en mis dedos. Hoy por ti una rosa es mi cuerpo, mi aroma de mujer. Hoy por ti mis ojos tristes son un "Te Extra?o", un suspiro es un "Te Quiero". Hoy por ti la calle es un bello paraiso, un hoja es una estrella en mi cielo. Hoy por ti esta distancia es mi ilusion, un beso es un "Gracias Mi Amor". Hoy por ti soy lo mejor... Por ti mi corazon escribe miles de garabatos, plasmando en un papel lo mucho que te quiero. Por ti hoy descubri lo doble de mi, descubri el porque te amo asi. Hoy por ti e tocado el cielo y escribi en el un Te Amo dejando miles de besos... ...solo para ti. Te amor  bueno espero que te sirva........suerte!!

(in India...where ppl live under the poverty line....lil children don't get enough money to study....our institution provided it for free...)  that was the nicest thing that i had done....because giving knowledge is like framing the future of your country...and i was glad that i was a part of it.

674e0ad95f862cc2fdd12dc536cb6c86aa	Yes, several times. That's the reason why I don't even bother anymore.     Two days ago 'KKK' asked a number of his usual verge of dementia questions. One of the questions was 'How do you call a gay man who abuses a child' (or something similar) my answer was KKK, and of course I reported him.    LESS than 5 minutes later, I received a violation notice from Yahoo!  His multiple reported questions stayed on the board for about 24 hours.|`|AA10663644	Wide Awake is exactly correct. Saying 'reported' is neither a question or an answer, and there for by technicality a violation of the TOS!|`|CwUC4knDaa	Yes it happened last week when some guy named kidrocks 08, and kidrocks 09 was harassing me in the religion section. He kept posting questions about me, and calling me a ugly dyke ******.. he said I will burn in hell, and I am worthless.. he posted my number on Yahoo Answers, and sent me hate mail after hate mail. He posted 12 questions in all, and I reported him... Some how my account got deleted, and I started over.    His account was also deleted... I guess my account was deleted because I cursed him out in one of the answers to his questions!!|`|rmoL4DLOaa	yes. Yahoo is on the verge of getting reported, too.|`|1186dcf9b910880f9b935d2af4109509aa	Yes    That is why I no longer say, You have been reported for that filthy thing...I just do it without saying much.      I work too hard for my points to lose them to some idiot again. What blew me away the last time is that the troll/clone was on one night with THREE personnas simultaneously and we who were her victims amazingly got dinged for points beyond belief, one of us was severely hacked, and we all were gifted with emails so filthy they could curl your toenails.    The one who was hacked called the FBI and since then the person is a bit more low key but still stupid and full of bs.|`|05c2856b3598ce21df8a5a37e225e4a9aa	Oh my yes.    I have reported trolls, the troll reports me, and I get deleted while THEIR filth stays up.    Here is a gripe of mine about Yahoo Answers reporting system:    There was one of the many Anti-Gypsy questions.  In it were a solid 10 people bashing Gyspies.  One said blatantly that Hitler would have been a hero had he succeeded in killing all of us (I am Romani... Gypsy).  I expressed my displeasure, but mildly.    I was violated but none of the other hate speech was deleted out of that thread.  I had reported every one of the bigots but MY answer, a very mild one (I believe I said that two of the bigots should get together because they were meant for each other) was deleted and I got a violation notice.    I posted a question about Holocaust deniers.  The original was deleted because I used the evil word "idiots" in regards to Holocaust deniers.  I got a violation notice for that.  However, look at the filth they allow to stay up.    I have had numerous violation notices, I believe, because I speak out against bigots and they do not like that.  I am certain that is why I get them.    I contact Yahoo Answers in their forum and in their two emails.  Sometimes I get an email back saying it is under review.    NEVER have I heard more.    I have written Yahoo Answers repeatedly for allowing violations of ITS TOS and they have NEVER written back.|`|vAdqvTkvaa	Thats why I stay away from the hypocritical practice of tattling on others ever since back in kindergarten.|`|91a8e11ad451c7891d7ab5f0dab8a125aa	Just report the trolls and move on.  Don't give an answer saying that they were reported.  You will gain 2 points, but lose 10 if you get reported for not giving a valid answer.  Besides, why give them the satisfaction that they crave?|`|91acf4dec3b907fa1dddca164a816d32aa	A member of Yahoo! Answers Abuse Team has said on the Message Board "to report suspected abuse, please click the Report Abuse link next to the question. Posting that you're reporting is not an answer and will be removed as such."    Also, regarding account suspension; "An account cannot be reinstated unless we find there was an error in applying the community guidelines or Yahoo! Terms of Service."    Also, if you use your email account associated with Yahoo! Answers to respond to a troll you are risking deletion of that email account.    Trolls have continuously said that their objective is to get other peoples accounts suspended. By responding to them at all is playing the game they want you to play and puts them in control. With the sole exception of reporting abuse through the report abuse link, trolls should be avoided.|`|LOrn0TbIaa	just typing " reported " or" nyanya I reported you" is in itself a violation of the TOS.

AA10819547	You might remind him that Pope John-Paul II did not condone homosexual activity, but did not condemn homosexuality.      Pope Benedict XVI takes the same line    I think both were wrong to condemn homosexual activity (I'm going to hell) but that does not mean that a GSA is counter to the Church's teachings or stance.|`|AA11279122	It's pathetic...do you mean you can't go to the school newspaper about it? --maybe you could go to a more public venue..like a major newspaper, a tv interview...whatever...embarrass them.|`|7d9e9cd29214a6cb2b48c8a1a86cfa3baa	It's total crap!    However, I've no doubt that the White House wishes it had the same power over all newspapers.|`|4B08ki6Laa	God, your school sounds awful, sorry mate. Could you send an anonymous letter to the newspaper explaining the clause?|`|c573f7ac6e5d1bec7e5fc59b2cf6d1adaa	Do you think you could write an anonymous letter to the newspaper.|`|4b4ac22b307d13575f5331020f87b798aa	I'm glad you are trying to take a stand and it does sound like total crap what they are trying to do.  I would ask the school chaplain to come with you to talk to the principal.  I doubt the chaplain would have approved if the Catholic Church would be against it.  The group is to promote tolerance and understanding, which is something that is valued by the church|`|1STa1TIIaa	GO to a different school.    I completely agree with your faculty in this matter. They run a private school, and can therefore run it however they please, even if it is unpopular.    Want to have gay friends? Go to public school, where they cannot do things like that.

I think your mailman is delivering the mail and your dog is just telling you he is there.  If you got a dog that can tell the difference between a christian, especially a fundamentalist one, and an unbeliever, I need to borrow that guy for a while.  I'd like to take him down the pews at church and see who he barks at - what a riot that would be!   I think that a lot of people that think they are so holy would be found out to be full of crap.

htSZsds7aa	they  are all 3, the father, son and spirit. Thats what christians believe...whether its fact or no, it is faith. that's what religion is about...faith.   For Brian: People wrote about Christ when he was a child, but he wasn't doing the miracles til he turned 30, that is when all the stories of Jesus were written by his disciples.|`|GhETSRdUaa	Excuse me, I'm not one of those judgmental "You dance, you go to hell" Christians, but I'm also not one to try and drain other people's religion from the face of the planet because it has a different perception than mine.     And that quote wasn't that contradictory, so it really served no part in your justice of atheism.     Had you been educated in Christianity, you would know that God and Jesus are not exactly the same person, they just share the same spirit. The father is the creator, held responsible for intelligent design, Jesus is the messiah sent to save humanity from its degrading ways ( "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life." {John 3:16})     So of course God knows when he's going to end the world that is in his control, and no other "prophet" "soothsayer," "fortune teller", knows.    I'm not enforcing anything on you, so don't cry and throw a fit like most atheists do, and I'm not saying that is certainly positive, because it's not. Christianity, just like every other religion, is not based on certainty, but based on faith. And that faith is a take-it-or-leave it action, chosen by you and your beliefs and your decisions.     So you're not "getting" anybody, nor are you facing me with some big head-scratching challenge, you're just coming off extremely narrow-minded and unwilling to accept what others have faith in.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	There were   many things that the Father knew that the son didn't know or could not permit.He was the son,the son is the son not the Father,and never will be the Father,the Father always has more knowledge than the son.The trinity is a false doctrine,(called mysterious and unexplainable) taught by men,the word is not even in the Bible  Jesus did not know the day and hour,Matthew 24:13  He could not give his disciples to permission   to sit one on his right hand and one on his left in the Kingdom.Matthew 20:23  John 14:28  Read in the Bible the accounts of Jesus he always refers back to his father.  He told Satan it was to God only that you should render worship,not him.  Luke 4;5-8  Matthew 16:13-18 he clearly and plainly explained to his disciples who he was when there was a lot of confusion about who he was.  Beware of peoples opinions,like I can't explain  it,I really don't know,it's a mystery.  The Bible is plain and simple to understand,Jesus did not lie,if he wanted worship for himself ,he would have told us explicitly to do so.  1 Timothy 3:4  2 Timothy 4;3  Exodus 6:3 Isaiah 12:2  Jesus did exist and was alive because the historian Josephus wrote about him in his History of the Jews.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	So you throw out the rest of the bible because of one verse you took out of context?    My Father and I are one, John 10.30    John 1.1 explains all that too.    You can have your perogative to believe what you will, but twisting the bible to suit yourself is a whole different story.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Don't be silly.  Logic is not something Christians could ever use to interpret the Bible...(there are so many contradictions in the Bible which is probably why people have been killing each other over it for centuries).  Here's another poser, if Jesus prays to "his Father", is he praying to himself if they are one and the same?  Or why would Jesus say "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do" when he was on the cross if all he needs to do is forgive them himself if he was God?|`|JQIztxIlaa	People say God is Almighty. If so, can he create a stone so heavy that he can't lift up?    Fellow pagans, I think now we got them. lol|`|si3eq11haa	i will answer this...  Jesus is the Son, not the Father.  Only the Father knows the time of Jesus coming back.  the scriptures obviously mean something to you for you to spend so much time arguing them. God says that His Word will not go out without accomplishing all that He sends it to do.  therefore, as you read, and debate scripture, it is having a profound effect on your life. maybe you wont realise it at the moment, but you will.   oh, and Brian, when its dark outside, and the full moon is up, does it not give light to everything?   instead of trying to goad those who believe in Jesus, why not think about the question you have posted....  when Jesus comes back, and He will, would you rather be on His side, the side of Almighty God, or would you rather be on the losing side? or should i say, the lost side.  may God bless you.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	maybe they are 3 separate beings.|`|yMqWvG8naa	Christians:    If jesus existed, why didn't anyone write about him during his lifetime?    And if creationism happened, why do bats have solid bones? And why do Emus (who have never flown) have hollow bones?    And if the bible is "God's word," why would he lie and say that the moon creates light when it doesn't?  You'd think he would know if he was the one who made it...    Fellow atheists, I think we got them. lol|`|7kJFmyxdaa	First of all, Jesus is the Son of God. God is His Father. God the Father only knows the day and the hour. Jesus himself does not even know when His return will be. The day it all begins is the day Jesus will know.     Read the scripture again. Jesus says, My (Jesus) Father (God) only.      Next question please.

They as you know will change scripture so as it will not contradict what they teach. People as in Chrisendom and the cults will often take the word of whoever is teaching them and put their trust in what they tell them. One should do his own research and check out what they have been told and to read for themselves, make their faith their own.

There is a symbollism of taking what 's not yours in your dream.  You regretted it and you tried to hide the fact that you took from the rich girl, but eventhough you were never confronted with this, you still felt guilty.

Adam sinned and God ran him out of the garden. When Adam and Eve had a son he was no longer in the image of God but he was in the image of Adam. Adam passed his sin nature on to all living persons because all people are sinner.

Blessed.|`|KUehcrofaa	The problem is a question of semantics.  I will grant to you that atheism is not a religion, however, the problem is what does atheism lead too?  If you ask most atheists what they believe in, many will tell you "I believe in myself."  Ah, now that is humanism.  Humanism is definitely a religion.  Humanism replaces God with self as the primary driving force in one's life.  Now, not all atheists are humanists, but even those that aren't tend to naturally ally themselves with humanist philosophy which is directly at odds with everything in the Bible.  These humanist philosophies tend to infiltrate the education system under the guise of secularism.  What you have in reality is not secular, it is humanist and the antithesis of everything Christians hold dear and it is against all Biblical principles.  Humanists see Christians as the enslaved bond servants to their God because they devote their life to Him, but Christians see humanists as being enslaved to the lusts of the flesh by devoting their lives to self gratification.  These lifestyles are alien to each other, but instead of showing tolerance, humanists wage war against Christians in favor of their religion - the religion of self.  The word "religion" itself is not adequate to define the roles of these philosophies and their impact when they are in contact with each other.  You see I doubt you can just say I have no religion because I do not believe in a deity.  I say so what?  The result from removing God in your life means you have replaced a deity with yourself.  Now I'm sure you don't call yourself a deity or believe yourself divine, but that too is irrelevant, because you still serve the god that you have chosen, the god of self, and you serve at that alter as fervently as any Christian.      So to close, don't get caught up in the semantics.  Atheism leads to humanism which is the religion of self - exalting man over God.  It still affects one's life in the same way as a religion and that's why it is at odds with Christianity.  Secular humanism seeks to rid society of all "religious" influence while pursuing it's own secular humanist agenda  and indoctrination, all the while being a religion itself.  But because people have failed to see this semantic trap, they fail to see the connection.|`|gfwK3SWIaa	It isn't a religion, it's the absence of religion.

I wish you well.  Mmm|`|hQLlGYsLaa	Their are many people who have been beat down all of their life with negative jargon. They have never been loved. They have been abused. They have been victimized by close family members. These individuals have not known the light of day and they see themselves as a carbon copy of the world that they have come to know and experience. They feel worthless.    Only Christ can lift them to see themselves as royalty in the sight of God. We must reach out to them with the Gospel. The Gospel transforms a man from a Pimp to a Preacher.  From Crack to Christ. From Dope to Hope.    Our hope is in Christ/    John 3:16  Romans 10:9|`|AA12346961	Exactly.

For example, someone thinks about becoming a doctor first, then plans and works to make that happen.     I agree with you whole heartedly....the best way to overcome problems and mistakes is to recognize them, learn from them, but not dwell on them. We have to move on. We can't change the past but we can make our future better.    Too many times I have seen people get into the trap of self pity - and it is a trap. But with the right mindset and a positive attitude, anything is possible! ... Blessings!
NsLtN7oLaa	Something like Aesop's fables would be a good way  to introduce proper values and wisdom to kids. It's  not necessarily religious, but it helps to develop an  appreciation for life in the ancient times.    As they begin to attend rituals, they will start to see   what it looks like, and when they are old enough you  can have your clergy begin to give them a proper   religious education.     Blessings,    Jean|`|ejFbnhU5aa	Well, I think that children's books are an absolutely wonderful idea, if you can go to a book store or find a few online. :)    http://www.paganparenting.com/    http://ezinearticles.com/?Pagan-Children...    and it's also great to teach your children to respect all religions, and that we live in a very diverse world, and all people are different, ect...    So, I think stories are great, and drawings. And if you can think of anything, arts and crafts (I remember making something out of clay when I was little) or you know, cut-and-paste sort of things, like crafts with construction paper, and dried flowers and leaves, acorns...ect... :D|`|4WqvTAfmaa	There are some wonderful, age-appropriate meditations for girls of all ages, some are fine for boys too.

There are books, loads of them, but not all come with the 'pagan' 'wicca' label.   There are wonderful fiction books like Mrs Piggle Wiggle (for younger ones) and Twig (for older ones).  Mrs Piggle Wiggle has moral lessons as well.  Any book about the workings of that natural world is a good place to start as well.  If you do rituals, have them help you with the things that they can and explain to them what you are doing and why.  If anything- teach them to love and honor all and that all life is sacred.

If you are a christian, the only way God sees you is through the righteousness of Christ, period.  In His sight you are close, you are righteous, and there is nothing you did to earn it, it was a gift through Christ. There is nothing you can do to make Him love you any more and there is nothing you can do to make Him love you any less.      My suggestion is to try to let Christ live through you and when you fail at this, Thank Him that you have already been forgiven and move on.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I don't think I am as close to him lately, I have put worldy before God recently.

Damn.     Well  there better be cable in heaven cuz I planned on watching all them people burnin.    Salvation for all is written all over the bible.    I dunno Jay.  As i always say, I can see how God can forgive a sinner.  I dont know how the heck He can forgive the pious.    Oh, the bible says no scripture is for individual interpretation.  That would take all authority away from God (which alot of you like)        The parable of Lazarus and the rich man, long used by mainstream Christian ministers to teach the "reality of hell," really has nothing to say about punishment or reward in the afterlife. Yeshua used this story, which fit the common misconception about life after death in his day, to show the fate that awaited the Jewish nation because of the unbelief and faithlessness which caused them to reject him as the Messiah. They still suffer from that fate to this very day. Yet the time is soon coming when God will pour on the Jews the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on their Messiah whom they pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for him as one grieves for a firstborn (Zec. 12:10).

It says all the dead don't praise the Lord and they have no conscience of nothing. But who wrote that was Solomon, a man who talked about vainity of life telling it passes away quickly. Solomon spoke about the PHYSICAL WORLD, not about spiritual world. It means that when he says "dead have no conscience of nothing", it's about body, not soul. Remember body passes away. Our PHYSICAL life is a vanity in Solomons views. It's obviously we go hell or heaven after death. Just read this parable Jesus telled...    "19 There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day. 20 But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate, 21 desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell[d] from the rich mans table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. 22 So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abrahams bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. 23 And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.   24 Then he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented. 26 And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us.   27 Then he said, I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my fathers house, 28 for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment. 29 Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 30 And he said, No, father Abraham; but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent. 31 But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead. (Luke 16:19-31)    Read also Revelation 6:9-11.|`|q6KmVWS1aa	You're absolutely right!  No body goes to heaven or hell when they die.  It says that the dead in Christ will rise first, then, we that remain will be caught up to meet them!    hell is the grave, Hell is the lake of burning fire    Loved the question!!!!|`|AA11008046	No one has ever said that in my presence..where do you get these false teachings?  Only the soul of the departed has gone to Heaven or hell.  The body remains in the grave.  No one said God will burn His creation in Hell.  He gives us an opportunity to serve Him and believe His Word or not.  If you do not you are none of His.  Scripture says: "..why call me Lord Lord and you do not keep my commandments?.."In the book of 1 john it says: "..and this is His (God's) commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave us commandment.."  Lazarus and the Rich man is a teaching or parable but everything Jesus taught in parables is very similar to true life events; so don't brush it aside and say "that doesn't count"|`|MXDfO8WPaa	Is this a Jehovah Witness forum?|`|UITfm0fjaa	Yeah, if you look in Strong's Concordance, it actually says that hell means grave, or pit.|`|JREs9K0Gaa	What about the story in the Bible of the rich man who died and found himself in Hell.  He asked to come back to warn his family of Hell but was not allowed.  Why can we not take this literally but we can take "asleep in the grave" literally?|`|xLKPKgZXaa	Whether or not the story of Lazarus and the rich man is a parable is debatable although I tend to think that it is because, as you say, the bible makes it clear that the dead are in their graves until the resurrection (The bible says that the dead have no consciousness).  However, regarding the rich man and Lazarus, parable or not, the point being made is that no one will be returning, from where they have been sent for eternity, to give warnings to relatives. Nor will people pass from one place to another because it says that a great chasm is between the two.    Hell will exist. God is preparing it for for the devil and his 'angels' (evil spirits which are the fallen angels thrown out of heaven with Satan). There are verses in the bible which seem to say that, at the judgement, others will be sent there also.    M?  The bible does NOT say that the dead have no conscience, it says that they have no consciousness (which means that they are aware of nothing).  Look up the words conscious and conscience to familiarize yourself with the difference in meaning.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	Jesus said.. today you will be with Me in paradise.. 'today'...

Daniel 12:2 proclaims, "Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt."    Isaiah 66:24 declares, "And they will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind."    Psalms 55:15 illustrates hell as a realm of the wicked, "Let death seize them; Let them go down alive into hell, for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them."     Jesus described hell as an unquenchable fire (Matthew 3:12), a place of eternal fire, (Matthew 25:41) eternal punishment (Matthew 25:46), and as a place of torment, fire, and agony (Luke 16:23-24). Jesus taught specifically about hell many times in His ministry (Matthew 5:22, 29-30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15,33; Mark 9:43-47; Luke 12:6; 16:23).       AS for believing your loved ones look down upon you. I think it is harmless to believe such a thing.|`|afripzVJaa	I agree.... the key scripture is Ecclesiastes 9:5    if many bible scholars & people who actually believe in hell took the time to do the research... they'd know the REAL TRUTH!  fire mentioned in the bible is nothing  more than symbolic of destruction|`|blXUb2VZaa	The Bible also say that a non believer will not understand what he reads in the bible.....God say the bible will seem foolish to a sinner...(unless he confess his sins and repent)...uumm could that be meaning speaking to you........The God i read about in the Holy Bible is the same today, yesterday and forever he will not stand for his creation to keep on sinning. He say sinners will burn in hell too.......can't change the word of God it will come to pass whether you believe or not...Amen|`|2YTIwMgOaa	Jesus did not say that the Lazarus story was a parable.  So You are taking human authority and presenting it as Gospel fact.  Perhaps it is meant to be at the discretion of every reader to decide this for himself.    There is nothing in the grave but ashes and dust, IMHO.

GRAYktltaa	Here's my take on it...    Adam and Eve are the Children of God, there were other people but Adam and Eve were the beginning of the line of Abraham.  I'm just starting to read the bible but the references to the 'children of man' being different from them make me lean toward that theory.|`|AA11008046	Who told you that?  there isn't any proof that God only created Adam and Eve.  the Word of God only states they were the first 2 humans made.  There is nothing is Scripture that claims they were the only 2; and there isn't anything that declares He did in fact make others.  One of the mysteries of God that we as humans cannot answer.  There must have been others created.  If not how do we get different colors of folks?  In Corinthians - Paul's first letter to corinth it is taught that "the gospel is Heavenly Widsom" "..We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery...the hidden wisdom of God...Eye hath not seen nor ear heard..the things that god hath prepared.." and so on.  further along in that chapter it says "..natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God.....nor can he know them because they are spiritually discerned..."  When you get your spiritual discernment sharpened up you become more knowledgable of  the things of God and then He allows us to understand things that otherwise seem to complex for our minds to grasp.|`|YfbC1m3haa	the flood fixed that; we are all descendants of Noah's family now.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	And just who is this Steve guy who everyone keeps mentioning? Was he Adam's friend or something?|`|N4oLz5vsaa	actually there was someone before eve|`|55db1dbbab55471fd7e483514f53d0a4aa	Hi!  Adam and Eve were the first two created but when Cain killed Able and left home he left to live in Nod which was east of Eden. Genesis 4:16-26 tells you that is where he went and he found a wife there and bore a son named Enoch and they built a city.  So, you see not everyone came from Adam and Eve. God had created others after them in different areas of the world.    Have a great day!|`|cYQnjZDfaa	Unless it is incest.|`|RTaimrg7aa	God didn't necessaarily ONLY create Adam and Eve|`|Im9cwUIyaa	Wait!!  Who's Eve?  It's Adam and STEVE!!    Duh!
2d2ZuimCaa	God created man in his image .Man was perfect in every way with the freedom of choice. Man chose his own way instead of Gods way. Due to that disobedience sin entered the world.With every generation since, that perfectness degraded. Till in Leviticus 18:6 , God stopped inter family marriage to prevent what you described.
JZxZ8mKRaa	Without God how would the spirits have come into existence?|`|hjxsX4liaa	Hello  : )    Not really spirits, but ghosts. Do they count?    No religion, atheist  : )    Peace  : )|`|afripzVJaa	Spirit Creatures exist in the heavens. Such as angels.  But "ghostly" spirits or "mysterious" scary spirits dont.  For it is all directly linked with astrology and the Bible condemns involvement with this.    Read Matthew 2:1, Daniel 2:27; 4:7, Matthew 2:7, 16    Most hinduistic eastern religions believe in the spirits i think your referring to.    There are also wicked spirits such as demons......mentioned in the bible that do exist.|`|pTQPPd9Raa	Yeah i believe there are spirits. And I follow Wicca.
wnGpAVGFaa	I think Master might be more applicable to the word Lord, but not God. Because we don't live in a feudal society anymore, the word Lord is just nonsense to use. Master or Boss is probably the best translation concerning our current system. But that sounds ugly, I agree. Using these words makes me feel silly and subordinate and undignified.  And I think that's one of the reasons christianity and other religions have been so successful at spreading. They were used my top dogs to keep the people submissive to their rule and provide labor for their profits. It's like saying we are supposed to be like slaves to our master, just like serfs to our lord.|`|OxuLUCX9aa	Actually the word Lord or Master in ancient Hebrew was Baal. Which was the name of a Canaanite idol. Sometimes that word meant a ruler or leader not always  the pagan idol. Baal also meant Husband. The word God in ancient Hebrew was El which was the father of Baal. Bible Translators knew what they were doing when they took out the name of Yahweh from out the Old Testament. Which appeared in the original Bible 7,000 times. They were setting everyone up for eternal damning.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	No, he is a kind Master, people who don't really study the Bible have no idea.|`|BtFbHjHZaa	I would replace it with "Penis" that would make me want to read it|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Isn't "Lord" the same thing?|`|YuPNVX9maa	kind of, i'm not really very religious but i don't like the feeling of anyone being the master of me, even god.|`|z5ivAuv0aa	Master sounds funny and I dont know if it would.|`|kdo6qnS9aa	My interpretation of the Bible would not change one bit.  God Almighty IS my master, Jesus Christ is my Savior, and the Holy Spirit is my helper. I am a born-again Christian.|`|CmRYICAUaa	Try replacing it with "Father".  How does THAT change your perception?|`|ch9ipCTKaa	No, remember that the word "Lord" is often used throughout the Bible and basically means the same as "master".|`|TK2GmcOhaa	Hmmm.... just a question IF EVERYONE is EQUAL then why do we refer to God as LORD?    Just a thought.    Master would be domineering as if he was trying to bend you to his will.|`|9f55a86fa2a7cc5306d6dbf308617c5eaa	Nah.  They could change it to Howard as far as I am concerned.|`|08Ksc5Oiaa	MASTER!  MASTER!
LBqDQNFSaa	Good question, and one that I have frequently dwelled on. It is rather annoying. They seem incapable of leaving people to formulate their own ideas and thoughts, because they are so convinced they are right. I don't know why they think they are right, as they posses not a scrap of valid evidence.
aJLXBhoAaa	It means that all of the biblical heros were all human and sinners like the rest of us but they repented and got right with God. We all learned from their mistakes and how they learned from them.|`|IVy35SE2aa	the bible is a rather adult book.  The old testament, of course,  is the history book of the Jewish tribes.  Life was cheap.  They  were fierce.    Kings make the rules. Nobody tells them what to do.  They are  a law unto themselves.  But some people could influence them  like Joseph.|`|vuAD59egaa	We are all sinful human beings in need of God's grace daily.
yvDzvIbBaa	yea, I define it as an advantageous alignment of chaotic variables that work in your favour.|`|015c4be64c1987ae727eabb9ce9cc03baa	There is no such thing as "LUCK".  There are probabilities.  There is the chance that something will happen.  Thats it.  No luck.  Luck is a superstition.|`|v7Wflu78aa	We use the word "luck" or "lucky" as a means of acknowledging that something good happened, but we are not totally sure how it came about - since it seems unusually good considering the circumstances.    "What good luck," is easier to say than, "I am grateful that this good thing happened, especially in these not so good circumstances."|`|349974840c2ddf946cda1b9160ff2645aa	Luck (also called fortuity) is a chance happening, or that which happens beyond a person's control.  (beyond a person's control=divine intervention)    Jesus : I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man comes unto the Father, but by me.    Shema Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength, and your neighbor as yourself.|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	No.  No I don't.  I know that we PERCEIVE things as "lucky", "fortuitous", etc, but it's all based on us and our little bubble and how it effects us.  All of existence doesn't revolve around humanity, ya know.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	I do not believe in luck. I believe one makes his own luck and one chooses his own destiny.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	No, I just use it conversationally.  I tell people "good luck" or when I do something stupid "oh, just my luck."  I don't really believe in it.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Probability.    Like the utter impossibility of anyone winning the lottery, according to some.|`|AA10067344	I don't believe that luck is a force.  I use is synonymously with good or bad fortune.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	I use it conversationally, but I don't think deeply about it.  Like someone else said, if you win the lottery you are lucky.  But it doesn't mean you are generally lucky.|`|f4ik0ScQaa	Luck is merely confirmation bias.      If you think you are lucky, you will be lucky because you notice the times when something good randomly happened more.  The converse is also true.|`|pahrtdsgaa	I would say luck is have the statistically improbable happen, like winning the lottery, or flipping a coin 100 times and it being heads every time. something like that.

F7y1BZ4Maa	Here is a little information---    Son of Zacharias and Elisabeth, being of priestly descent through both parents. This lineage was essential, since John was the embodiment of the law of Moses, designed to prepare the way for the Messiah and make ready a people to receive him.    The sign of the dove, as an emblem for the Holy Ghost, was a pre-appointed signal by which John knew he was to recognize that he had baptized the Son of God (see John 1: 29-34). At the time of the baptism of Jesus, John saw the sign and heard the voice of the Father bearing record that Jesus was the Beloved Son, in whom the Father was well pleased (Matt. 3: 13-17).    Jesus praised John as a prophet, saying there is none who was greater (Luke 5: 33-35). This greatness consisted of his unique privileges and the quality of his work. He alone was entrusted with the mission of preparing the way and baptizing the Savior of the world. He did no miracle (John 10: 41), but magnificently fulfilled his assignment in bearing testimony of Jesus Christ. Jesus characterized John as a burning and a shining light (John 5: 35). After nearly a year in prison, John was beheaded at the instigation of Herodias.    There is more at the website below.|`|AA12346187	John the baptist  was  Jesus' cousin  and  for told  his  coming  '' I am not even worthy to  tie  his  shoes''|`|g4AAZRuxaa	One of the apostle that was chosen.|`|J7KSKm54aa	He is Lososha's husband|`|iHDYncuXaa	He was Jesus' cousin.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	Do you mean John the Baptist? He's Jesus's cousin, you could say. He prepared people for the coming of the Messiah, and he baptised people in a river when they became believers, therefore the name.    He was also the one to baptise Jesus, and saw the dove come out of the sky and stuff.

xQz5QwPHaa	To be honest, it's hard not to. I don't think it happens totally consciously, and it also depends on the medium. I think I tend to judge more in text than when verbally speaking. It just seems lazy to not type things properly, or at least, put some effort in.|`|m5ViQJPeaa	No, I judge by their answer. And I just correct the spelling or grammar afterward. Besides, I'm not going to pick an answer that is well written but says nothing but air. ("air" means nonsense)      Cheers,  Ren from Asia|`|i48kxrbaaa	People see it as a representation to your education or lack of.  Sometimes, people make mistakes in spelling or grammar, but excessive grammar mistakes makes me think that you're also poorly educated.|`|U1juqahIaa	Yes, sometimes.  If they are just learning the language, I don't worry about it as much because they are just beginners, but if a native speaker uses poor grammar, then I criticize, especially when I'm reading fan fiction or other types of stories. When I see poor grammar, it tells me the person is poorly educated or just lazy.    I don't mind slang every now and then but it does get out of hand sometimes.    I hate seeing people type in all caps or they either have almost no punctuation or they abuse it. Typing in all caps is considered shouting and it distracts me. Excessive chatspeak drives me nuts too. If I hear someone talking like that, I won't hesitate to correct them.|`|xtUaTVGeaa	Definitely; bad grammar slowly kills my soul :P|`|AA11592327	If they are Americans yes, if they come from a foreign country no.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	i do.  i feel bad about it, but i'm guilty.  i don't mind shorthand in text messages, but when i get emails that are all in shorthand or have bad grammar i get turned off.  how is that grown adults don't know the difference between "their" "there" and "they're" or "your" and "you're?"    another thing that bothers me is when people type in all caps.|`|AA11404742	If it's excessive, yes.  Just about anyone who attended a school in the US and paid attention should have decent basic grammar skills for English.  So unless they have a good excuse like a learning disability, deafness, etc, I usually assume that they are either lazy, dumb, or are deliberately trying to sound that way.|`|AA11903455	Well, i don't cos i consider that they might come from a non English speaking country. I concentrate more on trying to figure out what they are saying and can correct the person if its someone close to me, some people might find your corrections embarrassing or degrading, so you could as well ignore too.|`|01a19d2b8982bebcfca1b5520fa5d1e1aa	Yes, and poor spelling, as well.|`|AA12182074	I try not to.  I do if I know for a fact that they have had the same  chances for an education as I have.|`|NbPLf18Zaa	I think any person that says no to this is a terrible liar.  Grammar is a very important part of how we judge a person.  If I meet a person who cannot speak a proper sentence and use phrases like, "I seen a dog the other day" I immediately will try not to carry on a conversation with them.  Some accents can also cause people to view another person as unintelligent.  Words like y'all or eh come to mind.|`|Qu1nTLz4aa	If English is their first (and only) language, then definitely!  It annoys me so much. Everyone in the U.S. goes to school, right?  So, everyone should know how to speak the language.    You know what else? If anyone on Y!A isn't sure about something, they can ask me. Do accept and except mean the same thing? I don't know, I'll ask beadingbusily.    If English is their second language, that's different. If a person is trying to speak English, that takes courage and I have a lot more patience. I will correct them nicely if they make the same mistake repeatedly, though, because when I make a mistake in Spanish I want people to correct me.
e0ae95d1f5bc2a0de0726c8ae6fef57baa	What about seeing if your local stores would have things that you could raffle off or give away as door prizes.  I am president of a small fair board and every year we get approximately 300 merchant prizes to give away.  Maybe nothing overly big but still something.  For decorations I would go with easily cleanable plastic red and pink table covering.  The kind you get a dollar stores everywhere and then go and get a few of the inexpensive balloons in red, white and pink.  Tie those with their long ribbons to a rock wrapped in cute paper or sat in a small gift bag then sprinkle the confetti that you get at party stores or homemade if you have time all down the center of the tables and wallah' table decorations.  Hope this helps at least some.|`|4udzUGjkaa	sprinkle out some rose petals on the tables...I saw fake rose petals in a box at walmart yesterday in the middle of the tables put some votive candles.

But the problem with this, is that all the people who ARE threats would have to do, is pose as christians. It could be a dangerous thing to do.      EDIT: It still wouldn't do much.

If you do that, those religous people could be carrying things to create bombs. Like you probably wouldn't have suspected that on 9/11 with the terrorists, but they did it.

So, you must've been sleeping on that. Okay, let's move on.    God did hang out with them. "8And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves " So, you must just not like reading Genesis. Okay, let's move on.    Now we need major surgery. You are looking for the word 'holiness'.   You are right here :   Hebrews says, Without holiness no one can see God.    But is this hard ? Has God created us to reject us. No on both counts if you go by Scripture.   Indeed, before you the whole universe is as a grain from a balance, or a drop of morning dew come down upon the earth.   23   But you have mercy on all, because you can do all things; and you overlook the sins of men that they may repent.   24   For you love all things that are and loathe nothing that you have made; for what you hated, you would not have fashioned.   25   And how could a thing remain, unless you willed it; or be preserved, had it not been called forth by you?   26   But you spare all things, because they are yours, O LORD and lover of souls,       To sum up : You believe part of the Bible and disbelieve part.

y2VY4y1eaa	Ay Caramba !, Jason, you do like to sock it to them,   don't you ? ;-)    OK, let's wheel out the 88's on this one.    The men that 'wrote' the collection of documents that are referred to as 'The Bible' were, in fact, and for the most part, a large body of learned scribes from amongst the Israelite  captives of the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar.    Good ( or even not so good ) King Neb, having done a great deal of conquering and subjecting, and carrying away into bondage ( he seems to have been quite fond of the 'bondage' thing - I make no comment ). Started to development another obsession, namely prolonged life.    This obsession grew to such a degree that he turned his 'carrying away into bondage' thing into quite the focus of his reign. The reason why being that all over the place each culture seemed to have it's own version of the 'Elixir of Life' wheeze.    So he gathered together in Babylon the wise men and elders of all the nations under his 'sway', he even managed to gather quite a few from un-swayed nations too. And he put them to work, dividing them into various 'colleges' ( yes, the origin of that word-use ) of the scholarly disciplines to determine every aspect of extending longevity.    When the Jesubite Habirus ( Hebrews in more recent parlance ) arrived in Babylon they were astounded by many things, firstly the sheer grandeur of the place socked it to them, Hanging Gardens and Gigantic Ziggurats, and so on. By comparison Jerusalem was a slum.     The next thing to impact their 'reality' was the cosmopolitan nature of the city, there were people of dozens of cultures and probably as many languages, all busy Babbling away. And......by no means least, most of these peoples had ancient histories, and recorded ones at that.    These Jesubites felt decidedly at a social disadvantage, and set their scribes to writing up a history of their own. The biggest problem of which was that they didn't really have one. Remember that as far as they knew they started off with the flight from Egypt, where they had lived for hundreds of years.     In actual fact, Jason, for your benefit it may amuse you to know, if you didn't already, that the very name Habiru has it's probable root with the Hyksos Kings of Egypt, those wild invaders, nick-named 'The Desert Princes', were assuredly Semitic, and probably derived from the legendary 'Lost Tribes of Israel'.    Anyway, it is at this point, with the story of Jacob ( the same one who engendered to the Habiru the name 'Children of Israel', Jacob, taking the name of Israel, at Jaweh's insistence), Joseph, and the Amazing Technicolour Dream Coat, that the Habiru ended up arriving in Egypt in the first place, and I suspect that the 'stitching' together of a linear trail began with the Egyptian 'captivity', what more logical for a captive people than to hark back to a former, albeit spurious, captivity. It was the war-like Hyksos that captured the hitherto notably peaceable Egyptians, and took over their kingdoms, rather than the other way round.    Prior to this point the story of Abraham ( shades of Brahma ? ) begins with him leaving 'Ur of the Chaldees', which is actually one of the ancient cities of Sumer, the forerunner of then Babylon, and now Iraq.    Here are the clues, for those that are open to see them, the Pentateuch is, in fact, most likely a cobbling together of various ancient folk-histories, from several sources, they were translated, transliterated and certainly adulterated, by the scribes of Israel into a single and apparently cohesive body to give 'legitimacy' to what was, by their own account, clearly a rogue nation.    So, to come back to your question, the men who wrote the 'Bible' were actually a bunch of counterfeiters.    Now, to the goat herding thing.    Yes, control of malleable, and not particularly smart, flocks was definitely the thing, even in the later disconjunctive texts that comprised the 'New Testament', the 'Shepherd' motif was prevalent, and frequently ascribed to the teachings of the triple-character that we 'know' as Jesus of Nazareth ( as the chorus kicks in please note that the town of Nazareth, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, did not exist in Roman occupation times, but was founded a few hundred years later, more homework required ).    Yashua bin Jusef was, most probably, a Nazarene, a quite different thing, another failure of translation. Where this person probaby did spend a great deal of his time was at Qumran, on the cliff-hung shores of the Dead Sea, and he may well have been the leader known in the Dead Sea Scrolls as the 'Teacher of Righteousness'. Of course a frequently ignored piece of evidence of this is that at least two of the Jesus disciples, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, were closely identifed with the two most militant sects of Judaic freedom fighters, the Zealots of Masada fame, and the Iscari, the famed and feared warrior sect, modeled after such as the Spartans, who are now returning to public awareness thanks to the film '300'.    Again, curious how things go around, isn't it ?    Baaa, humbug !|`|w4M4rdCRaa	Absolutely.

AA10819547	"Real" men have that fantasy about sleeping with more than one woman at a time with everyone servicing one another.  consequently the status of lesbians and bi-females is elevated.      "Real" women don't consider sex the same way as men, given that they invest more into the emotion of the act than do men.  Consequently, they don't have the same fantasy of being serviced by two men in a mutual love-fest.    This discrepancy means that gay men and bi-males are given less credence.  Such is our lot.|`|Pbdqh1lRaa	Hypocrisy. People have that weird lesbian fetish, so they put personal desire over ideas of morality.     Anyways, it's more likely that those criticizing gays criticize all sexual immorality, and those with the fetish encourage lesbians and dont say much about gay guys|`|GHXeBM9kaa	That is only how it is seen by most hetrosexual men. You see they like it when women are gay cuz the thought of two girls is hot to them.. until u reassure them that no they may not watch and they sure as hell can't join. Then they hate us too.. Then some of them will rape lesbians and u know "show us what real man can give us".|`|9ZsQE0oSaa	Funny you should ask.....i had a debate about the same thing with one of my friends last night...i think its because most straight men think that lesbians are hot in bed and they just want to see them have sex!!!!    i will keep my eyes on your question...quite curious to see what other people say|`|86bdee7210e024dfe5c8dc94b917c424aa	You've never seen the movie "The Children's Hour," .... have you?|`|AA12067160	Like lesbians are hot?

For many STRAIGHT relationships, anal sex is unthinkable!  For many Lesbian relationships, anal sex is unthinkable!  People dont associate Lesbians with anal sex.  Therefore some are more acceptant of Lesbian relationships.    The bottom line is, that most people consider anal sex taboo, and judge accordingly.  Please take note that I am not judging. Just stating a fact.    I have nothing against homosexual relationships and never will
rPKifSd9aa	I used to be a total top (I'm a lesbian, so it has somewhat of a different connotation, but basically, I would perform oral or manual sex, but not recieve) when I was younger - I wasn't really comfortable getting f*cked but I liked getting other women off.

bMuwuAVOaa	What protects you from sick people is a vaccine! However if you are referring to those who practice the craft most of the goodly practitioners of such have a code of ethics that prohibits them from casting such spells on those who are not deserving of them. However I have known a great many folks who proclaim themselves to be Christians that gossip about others and spread nasty rumors about them causing these folks great anxiety and emotional harm.What protects you from that? I myself am welcome in the Christian churches from Catholic, Baptist and Lutheran to Methodist and the LDS. I also have many pagan friends who welcome me to their rituals. I am safe and well cared for wherever I go. Peace&Love be with you...~M~|`|KrTkyc9Faa	I not only think they can, I know they can.     Christians don't need protection from us, nobody is going to do anything to them. They do however, need protection from people who try to stir up the fires of hate.|`|dFBccLExaa	Yes, yes, and yes.   I don't really get the Christian part, or the sick part, but yeah, all three do happen. I've cast spells and had them work. Never needed to curse anyone, though.|`|Kru3PZbkaa	Most of us who use magic believe in the three-fold rule.  All energies that you put out will return to you three-fold.  These energies are not limited to magical energies.  It applies to anything one does.  Do you spread rumors about other people?  Don't be surprised if you suddenly hear rumors about yourself.  Do you make fun of those who are different?  Wait until the tables are turned three-fold.  Or do you squash rumors when you hear them?  You'll be surprised when no rumors are heard about you.  Befriend those who are different?  You'll have more friends than anyone (and who couldn't use more friends).  The same goes for our use of magic.  If I cast a "curse" as you put it, that "cursing" energy is going to come to me at some point, magnified three times.  But if I put out loving, nurturing, protective energies, I will be loved, nurtured, and protected.  Sorry, but being Christian doesn't give you a "curse shield."  And just a caution.  You're obviously frightened of being cursed (why that would be is your own baggage).  Do you think it's wise to use the term "sick" to refer to the people that you are frightened by, especially in a public forum such as this?|`|DAU9lIO7aa	Nops, religion cannot help in cases like this and I know there are magical things that works.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	The last spell I cast worked even faster and better than I expected - so yes - I know they can!    If you are defining curses as "a prayer or invocation for harm or injury to come upon one", then not only is that against my religion, it is against my personal sense of ethics...and besides, I really have no reason to want to harm anyone, so no Christian or anyone else  needs "protection" from me.    Sick?  I'm a little chilly because it's like zero degrees out, but I otherwise feel fine, thank you.|`|AA10122259	because of the fact that you are Christian, this does not guarantee you are well protected against witches, spells Or any type of hexes. Yes, casting spell really work. visit my website  http://www.sdmagic.net/  hail Lucifer!!|`|OqHPJGcaaa	I don't know  about actually casting spells, but I do believe there are positive and negative forces and some people may have the ability to heal or harm others; sometimes just by planting an idea in someone's mind.|`|zOX3bunMaa	I believe so, as I'm practicing the art of witchcraft.  And Christianity won't protect you. Heck, why would you need protection? Most of us aren't "sick or twisted". We use spells for love, friendship, etc.    Do love and friendship sound like "black magic" to you? Not to me.|`|YfwgvPaCaa	Do you really think that people can just kneel and pray and give money to their church and that it will make their dreams and wishes come true?   If you are Pagan, doesn't that protect you from these "sick" people?  Please be serious.     Come on. Are you kidding me? Our beliefs as well as another belief or religion is my personal relationship with the divine just as it is with others. Yes, I believe my spells and candle majick do work. Just like Christians believe that prayer works. We do not, repeat, do not believe in any Satan or Lucifer as you see it. We do not worship it and I most certainly do not believe there is a Hell. How we observe and worship is not too far from how Catholics, Pentecostals, and several other denominations do. We believe in faith. We believe in good works. We believe in spirit and energy and they are connected. Some of us are just a little more well connected than others. Please, in the future, do not disrespect others of our path, I for one, do not do it to those of yours.   Blessings|`|vUSLyZzZaa	I am a Christian, and Ik someone who had a curse cast on them and it worked.  Magic is real but it is not the power of nature but the power of demons.  It worked, I mean it was so scary because I didn't know how far the curse would go but thankfully it didn't do anything but scare the person.|`|NwF33thlaa	Spells actually work and a curse will only work if you believe it will.     And the people who perform these spells need more protection from people like you then you need from them.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	The difference between a prayer and a spell is whether or not there is a middleman between you and your intended action. The energy raised and released is the same.    Thus, to believe in the power of prayer but to disregard the power of spells is simply cultural/religious myopia. And since the ability to get what you want is considered 'power', it is also natural for people to want to control those channels of power. Thus, Christianity, Judaism, Islam (and others like them) try to put themselves in the middle of that circuit, to make the believers think it is the religion that is granting the power, not the person themself. The more powerless the person believes themselves, the more power the institution gets.    If prayers can be answered, spells can work.

1l74hQL3aa	our generation seem to have been brainwashed by the media for over forty years and more.

Believing in them would require a faith I'm just not willing to do that, I'm not willing to believe something without the evidence to prove it|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Excellent question.    Who can honestly answer on behalf of themselves?  All my early upbringing and subsequent experience has been on the basis of a world divided into Christians and non-Christians, like that's what really counts.   I now realize that basic ideological, or political, affiliation matters crucially too, so that while I call myself a liberal Christian, it could well be that my liberalism defines my Christianity rather than my Christianity making a liberal of me.    Which of us, on this site, does not believe that democracy and individual freedom are vitally important for civilization?  But they wouldn't necessarily be the core values outside the West.  So have the citizens of one-party states, or cultures where tribal loyalty is more important than personal self-expression, been brainwashed?  or have we?      Recent events are showing us that the Market is a false god who has now failed us.  Some of us knew that already, but for decades we took the goodies from him without thinking about long-term sustainability.  We were brainwashed.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	... arghhh!!! ... minde being .... controlled by .... glee...max ... must... get help... ... help ... me !!...!!     there is no such thing as a gleemax, back to what ever you were doing slaves ... i mean fellow humans|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Possibly your question was asked mainly with religious brainwashing in mind but I'd like to answer it from another point of view.    I believe in God & I've come to know him as an adult.  I also believe in another power, a negative power, the bible describes him as Satan an opposer of God. The bible also explains that the whole world is lying in his power (temporarily) - 1 John 5:19  This means that his values, ideals & goals permeate the whole system on earth. This is the atmosphere that we are raised in, we are surrounded by his 'air' . This explains the decrease in morals & values & the unrest on the earth.    So, back to me.  I became a Jehovah's Witness as an adult. I climbed out of this 'air' & changed my moral views & standards & put them in line with the God that I came to know. I'm still surrounded by the 'air' of this system but I try my best to not be influenced by it.    Now, the question is...Who is being brainwashed here?  The people who are still being moulded by this wicked system where standards are dropping lower & lower?  Or me for accepting a better guidance & way of living?    Truth is, we are all moulded (they don't spend thousands on advertisements for nothing)    Personally, I know who I'd rather be moulded by  Psalm 83:18|`|VPlKbDplaa	I think we have all at some stage been brainwashed but may not have realised this until awake enough to do so. This usually involves some major life-changing circumstance(s) to kindle and awaken the spirit within.     I like to think I have left my brainwashed days behind me several years back when I first started to question the belief system I was brought up with (christianity) and started to delve into other belief systems. Thus began my awakened spiritual journey. I joined a meditation society and that paved the way for spiritual growth....alhamdulillah.  I embraced Islam in recent years as I believe this was the perfect system for my own spiritual journey.     I hope I am grateful to God (Glorious and Exalted is He) and insha'Allah awake and aware enough of how the world is being driven.     It is not difficult to see that the world is being driven towards a 'satanic' New World Order that presidents and ministers often talk...as if they think that is a good thing!. And it is not difficult to see that this is been driven by a "hidden hand" that wants to put in place a system of the 'antichrist'. I am also aware that many humans are unwittingly being 'taken down' to the darker realms within by greed, lusts, and a whole host of other human evil tendencies. This is what the NWO is about.     I hope I am wide awake and on a path for self-purification so that I do not sucuumb to the control that is really just a means of gathering up the ego-driven, who are the ideal fuel for the fire of the NWO system. I hope that all will wake up and understand and embark on their own spiritual journey of discovery.     Not a proselytizer....I like the words of Hazrat Inayat Khan:  'Tolerance does not come by learning but by insight. By understanding that each one should be allowed to travel along the path which is suited to their temperament.

xNaN3VkJaa	It would be better if you would just read it yourself.|`|HBp5r76haa	People would do anything for 10 points....    Do your own homework|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Whatever we have, the property of it is Gods; we have only the use of it, according to the direction of our great Lord, and for his honour. This steward wasted his lords goods. And we are all liable to the same charge; we have not made due improvement of what God has trusted us with. The steward cannot deny it; he must make up his accounts, and be gone. This may teach us that death will come, and deprive us of the opportunities we now have. The steward will make friends of his lords debtors or tenants, by striking off a considerable part of their debt to his lord. The lord referred to in this parable commended not the fraud, but the policy of the steward. In that respect alone is it so noticed. Worldly men, in the choice of their object, are foolish; but in their activity, and perseverance, they are often wiser than believers. The unjust steward is not set before us as an example in cheating his master, or to justify any dishonesty, but to point out the careful ways of worldly men. It would be well if the children of light would learn wisdom from the men of the world, and would as earnestly pursue their better object. The true riches signify spiritual blessings; and if a man spends upon himself, or hoards up what God has trusted to him, as to outward things, what evidence can he have, that he is an heir of God through Christ? The riches of this world are deceitful and uncertain. Let us be convinced that those are truly rich, and very rich, who are rich in faith, and rich toward God, rich in Christ, in the promises; let us then lay up our treasure in heaven, and expect our portion from thence.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	You really shouldn't be asking for other people to do your homework.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Properly understood, the Parable of the Unjust Steward is not an endorsement of the fraudulent course pursued by an unrighteous servant, but a forceful explanation of how the saints should use their own money and property to lay up eternal treasures for themselves in heaven.       First it should be noted that the parable is addressed to the disciples, to the members of the Church and kingdom of God on earth, to those who already know and understand the gospel plan and to whom it should never so much as occur that Jesus would speak with approval of a course of deceit and fraud on the part of a hired servant. To them it should be clear that the Master Teacher is:       (1) In the parable itself-pointing out the diligence and foresight with which worldly persons make provision for the only future that concerns them, such being an illustration of how the saints should apply themselves in preparing for their eternal heavenly future; and       (2) In the exposition following the parable-teaching the proper use of wealth on the part of members of the Church, showing that it should not be squandered on selfish, worldly pleasures, but used for the furtherance of the Lord's work on earth, for the building up of his kingdom, and for the advancement of the cause of Zion so that the saints will have, in effect, a bank account awaiting them in heaven.       "Our Lord's purpose," Elder James E. Talmage has written in analyzing the parable, "was to show the contrast between the care, thoughtfulness, and devotion of men engaged in the moneymaking affairs of earth, and the halfhearted ways of many who are professedly striving after spiritual riches. Worldly-minded men do not neglect provision for their future years, and often are sinfully eager to amass plenty; while the 'children of light,' or those who believe spiritual wealth to be above all earthly possessions, are less energetic, prudent, or wise."       As to the proper use of wealth, Elder Talmage writes that Jesus is saying in effect: "Make such use of your wealth as shall insure you friends hereafter. Be diligent; for the day in which you can use your earthly riches will soon pass. Take a lesson from even the dishonest and the evil; if they are so prudent as to provide for the only future they think of, how much more should you, who believe in an eternal future, provide therefor!" (Talmage, pp. 463-464.)|`|89MKzLl3aa	Verses 1-8 Detail the important use of money. Our use on money is a good test of our faith in Christ ie, spend money wisely, not for luxury, spend money to help those in need and donate to charities- get the picture.    Verse 9 Describes "Mammon of Righteousness" as a term of money that is acquired unjustly. We are to make wise use of opportunities, and unselfish use of possessions reflect how we obey God.    Verses 10-12 Our integrity often meets its match in money matters. Heaven's riches are more valuable than earthly riches, so if we can't manage our earthly riches, we won't be able to handle to the riches in Heaven. In other words, don't let your integrity slip in small matters.    Verse 13 Money has the power to replace God in your life. Don't let it. No amount of money can guarantee happiness, health and salvation.|`|V0oc22ryaa	It means to be of good reputation with all your associates, the man did the customers a favor because he was about to lose his job and be in need so he lowered all their debts so they would help him in his time of need, so be of good reputation and faithfull with worldly things so that God can give you much greater tasks and spiritual ones too.........Even the boss who was about to fire the man thought he acted wisely and praised the mother for being shrewd.
FcZU29W6aa	I like the idea of going to one of the department stores and getting measured.    However, here is the formula, at least how I learned it years ago:    Measure around your chest area, as close to the area where the bottom of your breasts met your rib area.  Hope this makes sense -- in other words try to get your chest area without including any breast tissue. Whatever that measurement is, that is the number -- so if it is 36 then you want a 36 bra -- now for the cup size:    Then, measure your breast from a side view, as close as you can get to the ribs and then out to the end of your breast.  For every inch, add a cup size.  So, if you have 2 inches, you want a "B" cup.  One inch would be an "A" cup, and 3 inches would be a "C" cup.  This is how it was done years and years ago, but I really would go to one of the department stores that offer bra fittings to get a really good fit.    Thanks for a fun memory -- we used to "hope" we had gone up a cup size as teenagers, and would be so excited when we could say "went up 1/4 inch!"|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	There is no set formula, as far as I know. I went for my very first "bra fitting" four years ago. A professional fitter made me feel comfortable as she used a cloth tape measure, to figure my proper bra size. She then brought some bras into the dressing room, for me to try on while she waited just outside the fitting room. She came into the fitting room after I tryed on each bra to make sure it fit properly. I bought three & was happy to know that a card is on file for future references. There is also a  proper way to put a bra on which was news to me!!! I'm glad I now know.|`|1lCUPVAkaa	Log on to Sears or any dept. store site, They give clear pictures  and instructions how to measure, Since I followed their instructions,  My bras are comfortable! The measurements called me to smaller  around then I was wearing, and one size larger cup. I was surprised by  both size changes.|`|nwnILcEAaa	Have been to Penny's, measured and purchased the correct bra. Correct measures don't necessarily mean comfort.|`|8G42oyydaa	You measure under the bra around your rib cage, then measure across the fullest part of your breast. The difference gives you your cup size, the measurement under the bra give you the "inch" size".      IE 36 C|`|fEBOzWeXaa	I agree with  the getting fitted thing.  I have 3 daughters with large breasts and when the oldest was just developing, she grew so fast, I never got it right and finally took the advice of a coworker and took her to what was then Herbergers for a fitting.  My daughter was embarrassed at first but the woman was so nice and gave her such good advice and was so compassionate about my daughters feelings that we never went anywhere else during all three daughters puberty years.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	No.  I have never in my life had a bra that was a true fit for me.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Forget the formula.  Visit a larger department store where sales women are formally trained in fitting.  J C Penny stores actually post the certificates in the intimate fitting room area.  Most larger chains do a great job w/fitting.  Nordstrom's fitters were featured on Oprah.  This is no longer rocket science.  Get to a department store for a free fitting and enjoy your foundations as much as one possibly can (for me, "free" is the only truly comfortable way to be, but alas gravity has now made that an option only exercised at home.)|`|8e78ab3e9f61fd825a86ea5e1c7c2e92aa	The ladies at Victoria Secret are trained to do this properly.|`|EgXOeDP2aa	This website might help.    http://www.woods-online.co.uk/measuring....|`|AxtRjMlGaa	JCPenney does the measuring for you, if you are not too modest. The formula everyone is listing is in their catalog too. But from personal experience have the measurement done in the store to get not only the right size, but the right type of bra. They have many styles and sizes to choose from.   Trust me a 21 year old 38dd is TOTALLY different from a 56 year old 38dd. And so it should be with the bra that holds them.|`|fW029NAXaa	Its soooo important to get a good fit. Go to a store and get yourself measured properly - I recently got measured by 2 stores - Rigby & Peller and M&S - the difference was amazing 32E vs 36B which was loose and ill-fitting. The 32E is a perfect fit but I was shocked at first as I THOUGHT I'd been a B cup all my life! Read this guide to how to measure your bra size and how a perfect fit should look & feel. Good luck!

I think that those people may just be annoying by default.    Unfortunately, a rational view of most things doesn't often extend to relationships. Some people are content and feel no need to question the status quo, and some people are satisfied with very dull relationships.    We can disdain their lack of intellectual curiosity and excitement in their lives, but it is theirs to choose.    Having said that - yes it can drive one nuts. But we should keep thins to ourselves because they have a right to be dull.

God allowed Adam and Eve to experience everything in the Garden of Eden, but never to eat from that tree of good and of knowledge. They had a free will and God was testing them, knowing that they will succumb to the temptation of the evil one. If they had not listened to the evil one then we would not be here...easy to understand.  But in the wisdom of God, He made them so that they would populate this earth, that is why He created this eath and the universe in the first place. And when God cast them out of the Garden, He promised them that He will come and rescue mankind from the sins of this world.    So since then every man has been born with the 12 types of sin as described by Jesus in Mark 7:20-23. Even King David recognized this in the Psalms saying that he was born in sin from conception.    God wants everyone to recognize themselves exactly who they are, a heap of sin and only fit to be cast into hell, by standing in front of His Law transparently. Then they must come to learn exactly how our sacrificial Lamb of God came and took all the sins of the world away with His water baptism by John the Baptist and His shed blood on the Cross (John 3:3-5), according to the sacrificial system in the OT as set by God.    Only then once we know this and believe in this authentic gospel (not the one currently being preached), then we will become cleansed from all our sins from conception to the day we die, and made into His righteous children. This is how we glorify God!!!  For then only will the Holy Spirit who is Holy come and enter our cleansed hearts.    You can find this authentic gospel in our Free Christian Books by going to this website.    I will be reading the other answers with much interest. If it is not this gospel of the water and the Spirit (1 John 5:6-11), then its no gospel at all, and all who believe in anything else will be cursed (Galations 1).|`|3GO5k5nNaa	Salaam, this is a made up theology...  Christians believe that man is born in sin, whereas Islam believes that man is born pure.     In Islam, we believe that Adam and his wife did eat from the forbidden tree, and did cause the anger of God, however, God taught them words of repentance...they repented...So God forgave them...It was more of an origianl lesson as opposed to orginal sin...The following is the supplication they were taught and made as described in the Quran    "Our Lord, We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon usYour Mercy we shall certainly be of the losers." (7:23)     The original sin concept was intoduced into chrisitianity as a reason to justify the crucification...This concept was 'borrowed' from early pagan period when a blood sacrifice was made to the 'gods'    I recently heard Dr William Craig (a respected Chrisitian scholar) concede on the original sin issue, and told the audience that it wasnt a big thing.....|`|dDMOJWxwaa	We are not born sinners because Christ handled that with the atonement, you are responsible for your own sins.|`|91ACjB5eaa	1corinthians 14;33  God is not the author of confusion.  we sinned and we choose to, god war rend us, he said to eat of all the fruit of the Garden, EXCEPT for the forbidden fruit.  for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

Apparently, before Jesus came, all these descendants would not be able to go to heaven...so I'm assuming they had a direct ticket to hell (no line, no waiting....I think limbo and purgatory came with heave...kind of like a package deal).

That was something that they needed to come out with on thier own.  I know this, because I too dated a girl in High School and when I came out to her, she questioned the same thing.  I had to tell her that she didn't turn me gay, it was something I knew myself, just wasn't ready to share it with the world at that time.

AA11115991	Not at all, it can be very religious.|`|AA10694540	Music is one of the purest and most beautiful creation of God Almighty who set the tone and rhythm of every sound in the universe. Music or singing like all the creations of God, that now constitute an important part of our daily life, can be lawfully used or maliciously abused. Both music and singing are created pure, and beautiful like our fresh air and fresh water and they can be corrupted or polluted by evil-doers of every nationality, color or gender. The corruption of some music shows or songs does not make all the music or songs haram (prohibited) just like the pollution of  some water or fresh air by some people will not deem all the water and air haram (prohibited).     The sincere Muslim who is following the Quran will not find in the Quran ANY PROHIBITION whatsoever OF MUSIC OR SINGING. God is very specific and His commands are very clear regarding any prohibition given in the Quran. God, the Most Merciful, NEVER prohibited music or singing in the Quran. Any prohibition of music or singing that is talked about among some Muslims has no basis in the Quran. These prohibitions are innovations made up by some of the scholars and their followers who do not shy from refusing to follow the clear commands in the Quran and instead follow man made laws and books of Hadith and Sunna that contradict the Quran, contradict simple common sense and insult the message of the prophet Muhammad. These books of Hadith and sunna were written over 200 years after the death of prophet Muhammad (See Hadith and the corruption of this great religion). The prophet Muhammad himself followed and preached ONLY the Quran. These scholars and their followers, who failed to accept God's  law in the Quran, looked for different kind of laws in the interpretation of Imams (leaders), Sahaba (companions) and Tabi'in (followers). They invented their own law and claimed that "Music and singing are haram."  Those who are confused or ignorant with their Quran choose to follow the interpretation of these human idols and their laws and disregard the clear laws of God in the Quran. After all we should always remember that Quran is the book that God calls COMPLETE, PERFECT and FULLY DETAILED,       In the following paragraphs, we will see what the Quran says about this issue. I will expose the false teachings of those who refused the law of God in the Quran and made their own law to prohibit Music and singing. Understanding this issue is understanding Islam (submission) and what Islam stands for.  There are certain basic understanding that you should know when talking about any laws in Islam (Submission). I will talk briefly about these basics first, God willing;       (1) Quran is a COMPLETE, PERFECT AND FULLY DETAILED BOOK, (as far as this religion is concerned): See 6:19.,38 and 114; 7:52; 17:12; 11:1; 41:3; 12:111, and 16:89. Those who refuse this notion by God Almighty should not go any further. They will not see or understand anything as God promised in His book.       (2) The Prophet Muhammad, lived by, ruled by, preached and followed the Quran alone. See 5:48-50     (3) God is the ONLY source of law, 6:114. No one, including the prophet Muhammad, can prohibit what God did not, 66:1.  When the Prophet Muhammad once did, God admonished him in public to remind the believers that ONLY GOD can prohibit. See 66:1 and 33:37.   Many of those diseased at heart quote verse 59:7 as a proof that the prophet Muhammad permitted and prohibited on his own. They are hoping to confuse those who are not familiar with the Quran, as this verse is talking about the spoils of war and has nothing to do with any laws or any prohibitions.     (4) In addition to reminding us repeatedly that the Quran is DETAILED, God told us that He detailed for us what has been prohibited for us, see for example 6:119. God did not need assistance from any Imams, Sahaba or Tabi'in. God did not expect or wanted the prophet Muhammad to make his own laws. The Prophet Muhammad did not bring any laws other than the Quran, but the fabricators of the books of Hadiths and Sunna did.     (5) God does not forget, 19:64. He did not forget to prohibit Music or singing and waited for someone else to do it. The prohibition of Music and singing cannot be found in the Quran because God did not prohibit them.     (6) Those who believe God in His book believe that Quran is a COMPLETE BOOK as far as Islam is concerned and it is as well regarding all the prohibition. The list of prohibitions in the Quran does not include Music or singing. When needed, prohibitions are given clear and straight forward so as to leave no doubt in the minds of the believers, See 39:28.     (7) Some people do not want to believe God in the Quran, when He tells them that He has no shortage of words. God could have used both words, music AND/OR singing or words referring directly and clearly to them, if He so chose, See 31:27 and 18:109. The TRUE BELIEVERS know that the absence of these words from the Quran is because God never prohibited them and not because God does not use them, forget them, know them or know how.     (8) The Quran teaches us that God is extremely displeased with those who prohibit anything that was not specifically prohibited in the Quran, see 16:112-116.     (9) The upholding of any prohibitions not specifically mentioned in the Quran (e.g., prohibiting Music and singing) is tantamount to idolatry (6:142-152). Such prohibitions represent some other god) besides God.     (10) God condemned innovated prohibitions in 7:32     "Say, "Who prohibited the nice things God has created for His creatures, and the good provisions?" Say," such provisions are to be enjoyed in THIS life by those who BELIEVE. Moreover, the good provisions will be exclusively theirs on the Day of resurrection."

If its religious songs, its ok. As for other things, such as what you would hear when you turn on the radio, it isnt liked. Music can distract people many times from whats more important, God and your religion. Music also can cause people to get carried away. It is important in Islam to have self control and patience.

According to Islam: Music that leads to sinful acts such as drugs, sex, violence, etc... is absolutely sinful in Islam.  But otherwise, how would it be sinful when Allah Almighty Himself allowed it to Prophet David (peace be upon him)?     Narrated Abu Musa:  "That the Prophet said to him 'O Abu Musa! You have been given one of the musical wind-instruments of the family of David.'    (Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Virtues of the Qur'an, Volume 6, Book 61, Number 568)"|`|d3e2b16732ebc4b06fba98b83e2ed542aa	Maaazif is the plural of mizafah, and refers to musical instruments (Fath al-Baari, 10/55), instruments which are played (al-Majmoo, 11/577). Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated from al-Jawhari (may Allaah have mercy on him) that maaazif means singing. In his Sihaah  it says that it means musical instruments. It was also said that it refers to the sound of the instruments. In al-Hawaashi by al-Dimyaati (may Allaah have mercy on him) it says: maaazif means drums (dufoof, sing. daff) and other instruments which are struck or beaten (Fath al-Baari, 10/55).     Evidence of prohibition in the Quraan and Sunnah:      Allaah says in Soorat Luqmaan (interpretation of the meaning):     And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah [Luqmaan 31:6]      The scholar of the ummah, Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: this means singing. Mujaahid (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: this means playing the drum (tabl). (Tafseer al-Tabari, 21/40).      Al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: this aayah was revealed concerning singing and musical instruments (lit. woodwind instruments). (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/451).     Al-Sadi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: this includes all manner of haraam speech, all idle talk and falsehood, and all nonsense that encourages kufr and disobedience; the words of those who say things to refute the truth and argue in support of falsehood to defeat the truth; and backbiting, slander, lies, insults and curses; the singing and musical instruments of the Shaytaan; and musical instruments which are of no spiritual or worldly benefit. (Tafseer al-Sadi, 6/150)      Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The interpretation of the Sahaabah and Taabiin, that idle talk refers to singing, is sufficient. This was reported with saheeh isnaads from Ibn Abbaas and Ibn Masood. Abul-Sahbaa said: I asked Ibn Masood about the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks [Luqmaan 31:6]. He said: By Allaah, besides Whom there is no other god, this means singing  and he repeated it three times. It was also reported with a saheeh isnaad from Ibn Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that this means singing. There is no contradiction between the interpretation of idle talk as meaning singing and the interpretation of it as meaning stories of the Persians and their kings, and the kings of the Romans, and so on, such as al-Nadr ibn al-Haarith used to tell to the people of Makkah to distract them from the Quraan. Both of them are idle talk. Hence Ibn Abbaas said: Idle talk is falsehood and singing. Some of the Sahaabah said one and some said the other, and some said both. Singing is worse and more harmful than stories of kings, because it leads to zinaa and makes hypocrisy grow (in the heart); it is the trap of the Shaytaan, and it clouds the mind. The way in which it blocks people from the Quraan is worse than the way in which other kinds of false talk block them, because people are naturally inclined towards it and tend to want to listen to it. The aayaat condemn replacing the Quraan with idle talk in order to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge and taking it as a joke, because when an aayah of the Quraan is recited to such a person, he turns his back as if he heard them not, as if there were deafness in his ear. If he hears anything of it, he makes fun of it. All of this happens only in the case of the people who are most stubbornly kaafirs and if some of it happens to singers and those who listen to them, they both have a share of this blame. (Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/258-259).      Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):      [Allaah said to Iblees:] And befool them gradually those whom you can among them with your voice (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allaahs disobedience) [al-Israa 17:64]      It was narrated that Mujaahid (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: And befool them gradually those whom you can among them with your voice  his voice [the voice of Iblees/Shaytaan] is singing and falsehood. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This idaafah [possessive or genitive construction, i.e., your voice] serves to make the meaning specific, as with the phrases [translated as] your cavalry and your infantry [later in the same aayah]. Everyone who speaks in any way that is not obedient to Allaah, everyone who blows into a flute or other woodwind instrument, or who plays any haraam kind of drum, this is the voice of the Shaytaan. Everyone who walks to commit some act of disobedience towards Allaah is part of his [the Shaytaans] infantry, and anyone who rides to commit sin is part of his cavalry. This is the view of the Salaf, as Ibn Abi Haatim narrated from Ibn Abbaas: his infantry is everyone who walks to disobey Allaah. (Ighaathat al-Lahfaan).      Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     Do you then wonder at this recitation (the Quraan)?     And you laugh at it and weep not,     Wasting your (precious) lifetime in pastime and amusements (singing)     [al-Najm 53:59-61]       Ikrimah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: it was narrated from Ibn Abbaas that al-sumood [verbal noun from saamidoon, translated here as Wasting your (precious) lifetime in pastime and amusements (singing)] means singing, in the dialect of Himyar; it might be said Ismidi lanaa [sing for us  from the same root as saamidoon/sumood] meaning ghaniy [sing]. And he said (may Allaah have mercy on him): When they [the kuffaar] heard the Quraan, they would sing, then this aayah was revealed.      Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: A|`|cgGqHpRsaa	I think only the wahabis do.    not sure

Antes se crea que lo nico que exista era este mundo, el planeta Tierra. El sol y la luna eran luminarias (de poco tama?o) y las estrellas unos puntitos de luz que estaban en el cielo. La Tierra absolutamente plana.    Esto es exactamente lo que describe La Biblia.  No haba otros "mundos"  y Mundo y Universo eran lo mismo.  Giordano Bruno fue quemado en la hoguera por la Iglesia proclamaba que haba infinitos mundos y encima habitados.  Luego se vio que el sol y la luna eran mundos enormes.  Y que los planetas eran otros mundos enormes. Y que el Universo era gigantesco y contena muchas estrellas.  Ms tarde se descubri que lo que llambamos el Universo era slo la galaxia nuestra, la Va Lctea. Y que haba millones o miles de millones de galaxias.

La Anarqua es Humanismo  Imagina un mundo sin gobernantes, sin patrones,sin ejrcito,  sin polica.  Imagina una empresa donde no tengas que checar entrada ni salida.  Imagina que no existe el dinero, que tu puedes entrar a un centro "comercial" y puedas llevarte lo que necesitas (Solo lo que necesitas).  Es muy difcil, tan solo de imaginarlo, pero no creo que sea imposible.  Hagamos otro esfuerzo de imaginacin, tu quieres ser doctor, pues vas a una universidad y cursas la carrera, llega el momento que te titulas y ejerces la carrera, no lo vas a hacer para tener dinero, carros, joyas o residencias en el extranjero, NO.  Tu vas a estudiar medicina porque quieres ayudar a las personas, es solo eso nada ms. ?Es difcil?

Es la presencia de un sistema que mantiene la paz de un modo suficientemente bueno, como para no permitir que ninguna entidad monopolice la violencia en regiones enteras (aka formar un gobierno).    Lo cual me sugiere:    1)      Monopolizar la violencia es impedir a otros utilizarla de forma legtima. Si una organizacin impide a un individuo o varios hacer uso de la violencia para la defensa apropiada de sus intereses legtimos, est violando sus derechos.    2)      Si ninguna organizacin limita el derecho de terceros de hacer un uso legtimo de la violencia, cada persona o asociacin de personas podr hacer un uso efectivo de sus derechos.    3)      Si es este el caso, estamos, efectivamente, en una sociedad anarquista|`|bd7a1081c5fdf35502cd861dda32d5b8aa	Anarquia si apuntamos a lo que se refiere a GOBIERNOS, o POLITICA, seria la ausencia de gobernantes,  la UTOPIA de que todos hagamos lo que tenemos que hacer sin que nadie nos de ordenes,  Asi escrito suena a que es el paraiso , o aun mejor, por que no habria un DIOS que te rompa las pelotas jaja, y te diga que es lo que esta bien y lo que esta mal.  en otras palabras ,   yo no diria como dicen por ahi que es sinonimo de CAOS sino de LIBERTAD.

GE 19:4-8 A group of sexually depraved men demands that Lot turn over to them his two male visitors. Lot offers his two virgin daughters instead.   GE 19:30-38 Lot's daughters have sexual intercourse with him while he is drunk and both become pregnant by their father.   GE 24:2-9, 47:29 "... put your hand under my thigh, and I will make you swear by the Lord ...." (Note: This means "put your hand under my testicles," which is the manner in which oaths were taken at the time; "testament," "testify," and "testicle" have the same root.)   GE 29:16-30 Jacob marries both Leah and her sister Rachel. He has children by both Leah and Rachel's maid Bilhah, but Rachel remains barren. Due apparently to Rachel's generosity to her husband, the Lord eventually allows Rachel to conceive.   GE 34:1-2 Shechem defiles Dinah.   GE 34:13-29 Hamor, his son, and the men of their village agree to be circumcised so as to be allowed to marry the daughters of the Israelites. On the third day, "when they were sore," the Israelites kill Hamor, his son, and all the men of the village, and plunder their wealth, taking their wives and children, thus getting revenge for the defiling of Dinah.   GE 35:22 (KJV) "Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his fathers concubine."   GE 38:9 Onan "spills his seed" on the ground rather than fulfill his obligation to his widowed sister-in-law to father a child by her.   GE 38:13-19 Tamar plays the role of a harlot in order to have sexual intercourse with her father-in-law. She conceives and twins are born.   GE 39:7-23 The wife of Joseph's master tries to get Joseph to go to bed with her. He refuses, and flees leaving his "garment in her hand." She claims that Joseph tried to rape her, and Joseph ends up imprisoned.   EX 20:26 "Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon."   LE 15:16-19 (KJV) "And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even. And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean ...."   LE 21:20, 22:24 (References to testicles, or "stones" in the KJV.)   NU 31:17-18 "... all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." (Note: How did they determine which girls were virgins, and what did they do with them after they kept them alive for themselves? This is not a pretty picture.)   NU 31:31-40 32,000 virgins are taken by the Israelites as booty of which thirty-two are set aside as a tribute for the Lord.   DT 21:10-14 With the Lord's approval, the Israelites are allowed to kidnap "beautiful women" from the enemy camp to be their trial wives. If, after having sexual relations, a man has "no delight" in his wife, he can simply let her go.   DT 23:1 (KJV) "He that is wounded in the stones [testicles], or hath his privy member [penis] cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord."   DT 28:15, 30 If you do not obey the voice of the Lord, the Lord will cause another man to "lie with" your wife-to-be.   JS 5:3 "... the Hill of Foreskins."   JG 8:30-31 Gideon had many wives as well as a concubine.   JG 19:22-29 A group of sexual depraved men beat on the door of an old man's house demanding that he turn over to them a male house guest. Instead, the old man offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine (or wife): "Behold, here are my virgin daughter and his concubine; let me bring them out now. Ravish them and do with them what seems good to you; but against this man do not do so vile a thing." The man's concubine is ravished and dies. The man then cuts her body into twelve pieces and sends one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel.   JG 21:11-12 "This is what you shall do; every male and every woman that has lain with man you shall utterly destroy. And they found ... four hundred young virgins who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp ...." (Again, how did they determine which girls were virgins? This is not a pretty picture.)   JG 21:14-23 The 400 virgins captured above prove to be insufficient, so the Benjaminites hide in the vineyards and kidnap "the daughters of Shiloh" as they come out to dance and celebrate.   SA 5:6-9 The Lord afflicts Philistines with tumors in their "secret parts."   SA 18:27 So that David might be allowed to marry the king's daughter, the king asks David to bring him 100 Philistine foreskins. David does the job right and brings the king not 100, but 200, foreskins of murdered Philistines.   SA 25:22, 25:34, 1KI 14:10, 16:10-11, 21:21, 2KI 9:8 (KJV) "... him that pisseth ...."   SA 19:24 "And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night."   SA 3:7 (KJV) "Wherefore hast thou gone in unto [a euphemism for sexual intercourse] my fathers concubine?"   SA 5:13, 20:3 David had many concubines.   SA 6:14, 16, 20-23 David dances and exposes himself to his maids. (His wife, Michal rebukes him for having done so, and as a consequence she is made barren.)   SA 12:11-12 The Lord is going to punish David for his sin by taking his wives and causing his neighbor to have sexual relations with them in public.   SA 13:1-14 King David's son, Amnon, rapes his half-sister, Tamar.   SA 16:22 Absalom "went into his father's concubines" in the sight of all Israel.

iZN1mm7Haa	Es dificil dar un amor incondicional.  Todos los seres humanos, cuando amamos, queremos recibir lo mismo que damos a cambio.  Esto es: amor, lealtad, comprension, fidelidad, honestidad, respeto, etc.  Son cosas que si no las exigimos al dar amor seriamos infelices.    El amor de Dios es incondicional, aunque como seres humanos conscientes que somos, tenemos que dar mucho a Dios para sentirnos merecedores de tanto amor que EL nos da.

Donde tengo mis reservas es en el amor de pareja por que creo que si ves que tu pareja te maltrata, te humilla y te burla lo ideal es hacerse un lado, ya que una persona que te ama en realidad como pareja, no tiene justificacin alguna para hacer un da?o.

Adoptaban un modo de vida comunitario, basado en el amor y la paz.

Salvo por el amor y la paz,Cristo no tiene nada que ver con eso.  Jesus no fue contemporaneo a la guerra de Vietnam,y fue judio,no hindu o budista.

Son muy pocas las que se salvan, como el budismo, aunque tambien tiene sus puntos debiles en cosas como la reencarnacion en animales y el respeto execivo a la vida (Me refiero a cosas como tener que recitar un mantra todo el dia por haber matado una hormiga sin querer, exesivo no?)...                                    y por las tres que mencionas tambien|`|iK5OWObRaa	Porque para hacer "el bien" no hace falta creer en Dios.

Porque ningn mito o leyenda puede valer ms que cualquier vida de cualquier persona, y ella se ha ocupado de machacar y matar a miles.

Por eso la importancia de orar constantemente los unos por los otros, si hasta JESUS les pide a sus discipulos que oren por EL.

Abajo con la alucinacin de la culpa, dijo un defensor del "YO". La pura verdad es que, los que no?sienten culpa estn enfermos.    ?PUEDE ponerse fin al pecado haciendo una proclamacin en ese sentido? Eso sera como poner fin a la fiebre rompiendo el termmetro, como poner fin a la delincuencia deshacindose de todas las leyes. El desechar el Libro que define el pecado no?remueve el pecado. Hasta sin la Biblia el pecado existe y hay nocin de l. Hablando acerca de los que no?estn familiarizados con las leyes de Dios, la Biblia dice:    Cuando los?.?.?. que no?tienen Ley, hacen espontneamente lo que ella manda, aunque la Ley les falte, son ellos su propia Ley; y muestran que llevan escrito dentro el contenido de la Ley cuando la conciencia aporta su testimonio y dialogan sus pensamientos condenando o aprobando.Rom. 2:14, 15, Nueva Biblia Espa?ola.    Prescindiendo de las afirmaciones que se hagan, uno sirve a quien quiera o cualquier cosa que siga: Esclavos sois de aquel a quien obedecis, sea del pecado para muerte, sea de la obediencia para justicia.Rom. 6:16, Besson.    El pecado y la culpa existen en las vidas imperfectas de todos nosotros. El obrar como la mujer de Proverbios 30:20 no?altera ese hecho: Aqu est el camino de la mujer adltera: ha comido y se ha limpiado la boca y ha dicho: No?he cometido mal alguno. La generacin actual del Yo imita la negacin de ella a ver el pecado y la culpa. Tal como dice la cubierta del libro Whatever Became of Sin? (?Qu habr sido del pecado?), escrito por el Dr. Karl Menninger: La palabra pecado casi ha desaparecido de nuestro vocabulario, pero el sentido de culpa permanece en nuestro corazn y mente.  Nadie esta libre de pecado   Pero la diferencia en tratar de evitar las equivocaciones y para eso tenemos que aprender de aquel que nunca tuvo pecado y murio por nosotros, Jesus nos dejo su ejemplo y gracias a su sacrificio podemos creer que el reino sera un mundo SIN PECADO..." Venga tu reino".... Mateo 6 ; 9|`|vwY9N9mgaa	No, no existe esa persona. "El justo cae siete veces al da" dice la Escritura (cito de memoria). Ni el ms santo que conozcamos deja de pecar aunque sea por debilidad en cosas quizs muy peque?as. La diferencia con un pecador "normal" es el dolor que sus faltas le producen y que trata de rectificar desagraviar.    No te olvides que pecado es sinnimo de DESORDEN, contra el orden que Dios desea para la creacin entera, incluyndonos. Otra definicin clsica es "contrario a Dios y convertido a las criaturas", (adversio ad Deo et conversio ad creaturam, en un latn de aficionada, jeje)o sea elegir todo lo que no sea voluntad de Dios, aunque sea en cosas muychicas ya es un modo de pecar. No hay que serle infiel al marido ni matar a nadie para pecar. Ojal las faltas nuestras vayan siendo cada vez ms chicas y nos dolamos siempre, que es lo que nos perdona la falta, no la pena, que es otra cosa.|`|mW6aC490aa	no, de hechos todos somos pecadores|`|b13a62f05d7fc35c71e869cc3ec37766aa	Pues siii, alguien que no piense, no sienta, ni haga nada|`|NBwPOHYVaa	Todos somos pecadores, por naturalesa humana, la biblia dice, la carne tira hacia abajo y el Espritu hacia arriba, es una lucha constante,diaria,por,no seder,en los pensamientos,y en el hablar,y pensar,es dificil ser perfecto,por eso,auque no querramos nos podemos equ ivocar.|`|5GqaxCfZaa	No ..si sabes de alguno le hacemos un monumento y le ponemos velas...........................|`|5Zwddgcoaa	Es importante notar que no todos coincidimos en lo que significa "Pecado", cada uno tenemos un concepto diferente y por este motivo algunas personas creen que ellas mismas no pecan, mientras que otras las consideran pecadoras.    Yo entiendo que Pecado es no cumplir la voluntad de Dios, y esto tampoco es muy claro, pues no todos interpretamos la vopluntad de Dios de la misma manera.    Por este motivo creo que todos pecamos, en unas ocasiones de manera premeditada y con plena conciencia de lo que hacemos y en otras ocasiones de manera inadvertida.|`|c0bbfc1a416a6d03100ab92cb808e368aa	?todos hemos pecado alguna vez! y ya sabrs el por que; los mandamientos de la ley de nuestro dios dicen:1) Amar a dios sobre toda las cosas, 2) no tomar el nombre de dios en vano, 3) Santificar las fiestas, 4) honrar padre y madre, 5) no matar, 6) no cometer actos impuros, 7) No robar, 8) No decir falso testimonio, ni mentir, 9) no consentir pensamientos y deseos impuros, 10) no envidiar los bienes ajenos.    por alguna causa siempre se comete algn pecado, pero dios perdona nuestros pecados cuando el arrepentimiento es sincero y cuando nos pesa de todo corazn, ese es nuestro dios, un dios verdadero y de amor.|`|5ykgSqCgaa	No.|`|R42mYURYaa	No, no existe, ni an los santos, ellos tambien pecaron pero se arrepitieron.

AA11599370	!  I'd have to agree with others, get some basic grammar rules and just listen and speak. It'll come to you. Reading might be a big help but don't devote yourself entirely to it. If you want to learn to speak Russian - just speak, never mind the mistakes, especially the endings, they are very tough for a foreigner to learn and understand since there's no equivalent in English. You'll be understood and that's what matters. Also try to memorize some basic phrases and "play around with them" changing some words. ie: "  ". This ready-made and memorized sentence can be changed to: "  ,   ,    " etc. Get as many "stencils" like that as you can. This helped me a lot when I was studying Chinese. Try watching Russian movies with English subtitles. Getting a Russian friend would be a huge help. Don't waste time - start speaking to native speakers or co-students as soon as possible. And one more thing: everyone is "expected" to speak English and no matter how good you get at it you'll never feel appreciated for the effort, with Russian (and almost any other language) it's different: your effort is greatly appreciated and people really warm up to you, this would encourage you to get even better, trust me on that one. Good luck!|`|c9ceaf7afbe4dba9a4128d038f6dabf2aa	first of all i speak russian and i'm ukrainian. a hint i found from a friend who was english and tried to learn russian is that if you don't practice with russian speaking people, it will be very hard to learn. she learned how to talk a little by just working with some russian people.|`|7a62956d9daf1f6a1d040e7f9f4aceb9aa	Well, you should be very proud of yourself for at least starting such a task...if learning a new language was easy than all of us would be fluent in like 10 languages! And Russian, is actually a very difficult one to learn...I am Russian, and I remember when I moved to the U.S. the best thing that helped me was to simply listen to the language as much as possible and try to communicate with Americans....this wasn't hard since I was going to school then, plus I tried to watch a lot of TV and repeat everything that I heard. So I would recommend the same thing...try to maybe get some Russian friends so you could be around the language and hear how it is used, also maybe order some Russian DVDs and movies(http://www.russiandvd.com/store/ ) and just listen and repeat. Write down all new words that you learn and memorize. Then try reading russian books (if you can get your hands on one) I mean like easy kids books, every little thing will help you here. And if you need help email me!|`|1wOY3zD4aa	Russian is so much fun, but it's complicated too. The things that helped me were:    1) Reading newspaper articles in Russian (good for building vocabulary)  2) Watching movies in Russian (you learn culture and colloquialisms as well as practice listening and understanding)  3) Speaking with native Russian speakers, or even just other students of Russian. If you don't practice speaking,  it won't sink in.    And finally, consider taking an intensive summer program - UCLA and the Monterey Institute in CA have good ones, and Middlebury College in VT has a super hardcore program where you're forbidden from speaking English - feel free to email me if you want info about any of them!

But if you mean that he is foolish in continuing break dancing when advised by doctors to stop as it eventually will cripple him, then yes, it is stupid as he is putting his whole future at risk.

b0faTDlJaa	You are absoultely correct. Ive noticed this too. White people are the only group of people in the world with exotic colors traits like these. Caucasions in my book are as follows: Irish, Itilian, German, Sweetish, Russian, Greek, Scottish and much much more.|`|l9ab36z4aa	you need to open your eyes mate. Black people come in different shades if you haven't noticed and asians are all different i.e. Indians and Chinese people have completely different skin colours. White people all more or less have the same colour skin its hard to see different shades unless the person is red or tanned. At least black people don't burn in the sun as easily!!!!|`|e4aF8tdPaa	as an african american female i can say we all do NOT look the same. yes both of my parents are African American but if you were to look at my mother and myself we don't look alike. her skin is lighter than mine and her hair is straight. im darker then her and my hair is wavy. also my son is lighter then me with light brown eyes and dimples. there are some African Americans who have light eyes, hazel eyes, even green eyes. and not all Asian people look the same ether thats just a stereo type. you need to open your eyes because not all people look the same.|`|VsamHLPOaa	Just because caucasions typically have a wider variety when it comes to hair and eye color doesn't mean this makes you stand out. What would happen lets say if you all had blond hair and brown eyes? You all still wouldn't look the same because hair and eye color only go but so far. Here are two black women do they look the same?  http://www.hairfinder.com/celebrityhairs...  and  http://images.askmen.com/galleries/actre...|`|feoxRAUDaa	that's an uneducated question|`|kCbJ89nXaa	You need an eye doctor real bad.  African Americans no more look all alike than all apples are red.|`|hGNvbC6oaa	I don't agree with you one bit.  There are different variations of dark skin.  There are black people with thinner noses, wide noses, thinner lips, bigger lips.  Some are skinny, some are fat.  Just like every other culture.  Your question is so lame.  Because to me, all caucasians generally have a "similar" look.  Every race does.  Hence, it's a race.  They all similar charactaristics.  EVERY race.  Not just asians or africans.|`|xJiqkGV6aa	LOL entertaining!! and very uneducated... all people are diff in every race... how many times must an intelligent person point this out to you in order for you to get it through your apparently thick skull.

They don't.    However, what upsets me more than the misinformed question is the political correctness being dished out by some of the people who are responding.  These folks need to check their jack-boot, lock-step mentality at the door.    If you disagree with the question, make an arguement.  That'show you defeat a bad idea.  Not by supressing it!|`|XpEIZpYAaa	I am a black 25 yr old male and i think biracial people like Bionce and Obama are the most beutiful and intelligent. I dont disagree with your comments.|`|CgejEANRaa	Its funny how people can call u a racist when your obviously just making a factual point. Maybe they got their pannys in a bunch because u used the term "race of people" instead of using "group of people, so they think your racist because u worded it that way. I know what you meant. There is a double standard in the country because African Americans can say whatever they want regarding white pple but the minute the role is reversed, your considered a racist. Are we not allowed to have pride of our herritage and all the acclomplishment weve made in the world. I remember not long ago hispanics were wearing shirts that said Brown Pride on them. Now imagine if the roles were reversed and caucasions wore a shirt that, in big bold letters read, White Pride.... It would be an outrage... i ask you does that make sence?|`|qzL9vsFUaa	The real question is why are people so upset over this question.I dont think your racist, your just stating facts. Theres nothing daragatory about anyone in your statement. Maybe their jealous.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Ridiculous. All African Americans do NOT look the same, any more than people of any other race looks exactly the same.  You just have weak powers of observation...or you just don't get out much.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	What can I say except that this is a very ignorant question. I am a strong believer in free speech and all of that but I cannot tolerate hate, racism, and just plain stupidity. I am leaving this answer and then blocking you from this point on.

I cannot even end my answer with my usual "Peace:)" as I don't really wish that for you.
YyEEAJBkaa	Become more attractive to people who aren't necessarily white, middle class and right wing.|`|uwRYMelHaa	I think we have to understand what Ecclesiastes 3 (A Time for Everything) says. As a Christian for example, you are not supposed to be insulated from politics. We do not belong to the world, but we are in the world. We are not supposed to isolate ourselves. We need to be open minded. We can make good contributions to this world. What is important is to recognize that there is a time for everything, and I would say an appropriate time for everything. If you are at the church service, you are not supposed to be talking about politics, but you should pay attention to the message the preacher is sharing with you. But there will be a good time for you to talk about politics. I hope this helps.    Jaime Montoya  webmaster@jaimemontoya.com  http://www.jaimemontoya.com

AA11992885	the Torah alone should determine such, as the Torah declares that some sins are NOT worthy of death, and others are worthy of exile while others just a monetary compensation, and yet others lashes, and others death......i follow the Torah|`|Dgwy3YHsaa	ALL SIN is the SAME and is forgivable, except one, being the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, this cannot be forgiven.|`|zmVCqh7Daa	I think Davan makes a good point.|`|r8rykCkGaa	All sin is the same in the sense that it is still sin that needs to be forgiven.  If we are not forgiven we die in our sins and go to the eternal damnation, the lake of fire.  However, sin gets worse, the depravity of sin and bondage of sin will take you further into darkness.  For those who care about what is going on, this scenario would lead them to repent more earnestly hopefully, and thereby get delivered.  Now to understand more, you have to study the Bible and rightly divide the word of truth.  II Tim. 2:15

Q4MqzxX7aa	It's from a Greek word having the meanings of "birth," "creation," "cause," "beginning," "source," and "origin."    That's just what the guys who wrote the Bible called the first book.

Dang, I put Greek down first and then changed my answer when I saw Dreamstuff Entity's answer.|`|P6atY3xXaa	Yes.  Genesis comes from the Greek genosis meaning begotten or created as the first book of the Bible is about creation.    Hence, monogenesis or only begotten is about God's first created or only created son.  The word who became the man Jesus, genesised the other sons of God.

Typically women are more often bi, either because of biology or because of society.    Can we get married?  Yes.  Think of it this way - is a straight person attracted to everyone of the opposite gender?  No.  They're attracted to some people and not others, then when they fall in love they settle down with one person.  This often involves getting married, followed by having children.

Whether we like it or not it will discover what we are made of. People either completely fall on the evil side or brush aside all temptations and serve God inspite of all problems. It's a cruel everyday practical process. Why give it an abstract theoretical dimension?|`|JBkB1ZLJaa	Consider this:  A kid might not know why cars exist, but it is still quite useful for he to get to the candy store.  We might not all know mechanic, but it doesn't stop us to drive our car and get where we need to be.  A lot of stuff in the world exist in harmony with each other without us being aware of their existence or their functions.  We are starting to realise this now when we look at the global warming for example...  Of course having a clear meaning of God really helps to progress in life.  It gives us a reason to be. It inspires us to reach goals.  It keeps us organised and friendly.  There is a catch ,,,if we misunderstand the meaning of God it results in arguments and wars. The best thing to do is to keep it for our self.  We should only set example by behaving Gods like.  If someone wants to know about it, than we should be careful to only suggest our definition of it.  We  do not absolutely know its meaning and it would not be fair to take someone away from his path just for the satisfaction of convincing he of our point of view.    In case you wanted my opinion about God, I took the liberty to share this with you.  It is just a way to see it, and you can discard it if it doesn't fit you.    God is not an entity of any kind. Emotions and things (matter) are the actions and effects of this being (existence).    So if God is existence we can say that it is everything in everything.  It is also all thoughts and emotions for they exist as well.  Even the stuff that doesn't exist also exist because we just mentioned it now.  We cannot get out of the existence because it is infinite. It is our very life, thoughts, emotions and actions.  We cannot give anything to God because it is the very thing we would be giving. How could I give you your own arm and foot?  We cannot take away anything from it. Where would we put it? There is no outside room beside infinity to store something.   God is a raw material. It has no intention to dictate anyone his way.  God is absolute energy. To dare to visualise it we can imagine this:  The world we know is base on simply 2 elements. Molecules(this is just one of many other particles) and vibration.    Together they form infinite little solar systems.  If we take the smallest particle out of the equation for a second and analyze it, we would find this:  A particle is like a ball created by many other kind of smaller balls that vibrates around it, giving the illusion of being solid.  It is like so infinitely small and infinitely large. Don't take my words for it. Just observe the discovery that science find every day. The only reason we cannot get smaller particles at this time is limited by the primitive tools we have and the budget available to these researchers.  As far as large goes we never arrived to the end yet.  If we get to the end. What would be next? Well something else or nothing at all. This new change would go for while and change to something different again and again. This for ever infinitely. We just can't get away from infinity for that's all there is.     Now what do we do with this you might ask?  Well God, the raw energy, is like a can of paint. It has no meaning until we give it one. One can draw a beautiful picture that would inspire the world. An other could put some of this paint in the food of a great restaurant and ruin their reputation and possibly poison a customer as well.  Maybe someone else would write insults on his neighbors house while an other would draw a sketch to coach engineers on the fabrication of a bridge.   As we can see paint doesn't care what we do with it. The same applies to God.    We can think good and serve others. This will attract more friends and happiness. We can argue and insult others and feel miserable as result. It is certain that good brings more good and bad  attracts bad.  It is a matter of choice.  Conclusion: God exist, some don't know it, some do but cannot explain its functions. It still has its meaning anyways.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Sounds about right to me.|`|f4ik0ScQaa	Blimey I never thought of it like that.  Sounds like you're right.

Therefore, our liberated occupation (or dharma) is to be engaged in loving reciprocation with God.

Why not say "I don't need the rest of my family as long as I have my father"? The Church is a single body; the different members interelate and rely on one another: "The eye cannot say unto the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!" (I Co 12:21).   St. Irenaeus Against Heresies (circa 189 A.D.) :  ..the virgin Eve, betrothed to a man but nevertheless still a virgin, was unhappily led astray,-- yet that deception was done away with because the Virgin Mary, betrothed to a man but nevertheless still a virgin, heard the truth spoken by an angel, and was obedient. For just as the former was led astray by the word of an angel, so that she fled from God when she had transgressed His word; so did the latter, by an angelic communication receive the glad tidings that she should   sustain (portaret) God, being obedient to His word.   The former disobeyed God, yet the latter was persuaded to be obedient to God, so that the Virgin Mary might become patroness (advocata) of the virgin Eve. And thus, as the human race fell into bondage to death by means of a virgin, so is it rescued by a virgin; virginal disobedience having been balanced in the opposite scale by virginal obedience. In the same way the sin of the first created man (protoplasti) is made amends by the correction of the First-begotten, the coming of the serpent is conquered by the harmlessness of the dove, those bonds being unloosed by which we had been fast bound to death.        Quite true. "Mariolatry" means the worship of Mary, giving her the kind of honor due only to God (Greek: latria). Since Catholics justifiably give her greater honor than they give other saints, but less than they give to God (and not just less, but a fundamentally different kind of honor), Mariolatry does not exist in Catholic piety. In fact, the Catholic Church forbids Mariolatry because it forbids us to worship anyone other than God himself: "Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. It remains a constant temptation to faith. Idolatry consists in divinizing what is not God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres a creature in place of God. . . . Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of God; it is therefore incompatible with communion with God" (Catechism of the Catholic Church 2113, cf. 21102112, 2114).  Yup Catholics do that biblical thing Pray to Mary and not only Mary but the Saints for their intersession.  And yes its very biblical for those who say their can be only one Mediator between God and Man you are correct.   But what does it say about interseceroy prayer.     Because he is the only God-man and the Mediator of the New Covenant, Jesus is the only mediator between man and God (1 Tim. 2:5), but this in no way means we cannot or should not ask our fellow Christians to pray with us and for us (1 Tim. 2:14). In particular, we should ask the intercession of those Christians in heaven, who have already had their sanctification completed, for "[t]he prayer of a righteous man has great power in its effects" (Jas. 5:16).      Not only do those in heaven pray with us, they also pray for us. In the book of Revelation, we read: "[An] angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer; and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne; and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God" (Rev. 8:3-4).     Thus, in Psalm 103 we pray, "Bless the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word! Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will!" (Ps. 103:2021). And in the opening verses of Psalms 148 we pray, "Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise him in the heights! Praise him, all his angels, praise him, all his host!"     Jesus himself warned us not to offend small children, because their guardian angels have guaranteed intercessory access to the Father: "See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 18:10).       "But not the high priest [Christ] alone prays for those who pray sincerely, but also the angels . . . as also the souls of the saints who have already fallen asleep    Rom 6:3-4   Or are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might live in newness of life.     Col 2:12   You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.  Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, the saints, and also for me, that utterance may be given me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak" (Ephesians 6:18-20).   Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, the saints, and also for me, that utterance may be given me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak" (Ephesians 6:18-20).

He sent Prophets to teach humans how to worship him   The first prophet was our father Adam   But the humans forget, change & loose the correct way.  GOD sent other prophets with the same message.

FxGRZvVbaa	Dear Brad,    First off, thank you for your question.  I definatly understand how you feel.  Early on in my walk with Christ, I too felt the same way you do about those who profess Christ yet seem not to even follow his teachings.      But I have found that in every situation in our lives, we attract people, places and things into our lives based upon our own thoughts, feelings, and actions.      When dealing with hateful Christians, the first thing you need to ask yourself is what is it about their and actions that I have a problem with?  Try to think about it in an objective way, without any emotional attachment to the situation.    Then ask yourself, What is it about my own thoughts that attract such critizism.  Again think about it without any emotional attachment.      Then ask yourself three simple question: (The way you answer the questions is not as important as asking them.)    Can I accept this feeling?   Can I let go of this feeling?  When?    It is very important to understand that it is your thoughts, emotions, and feelings that you project on the world that attracts to yourself the circumstances you are in.      You said that you managed to combat poverty, being kicked out of your parents house, homophobia, drug addiction and all of those other things by myself, before I even knew God.    That is wonderful news.  You already understand the law as it is.  You did those things because you made the mental decision to do them and then you acted upon it.  It is not up to religion to help you financially, emotionally or intellectually.  It is up to you to do these things.    GOD has made us in his own image able, to create as GOD does.  We have been given the power of free will, and the ability to create in our lives whatever we so desire.      As for those who say we are nothing without GOD.  They are right in one sense.  We are nothing without GOD, because we were created by GOD and only by GOD do we continue to exist.  By GODs will alone, do we exist or not.  There is no reason to fear, because there is no power outside of GOD nor any power greater than GOD.  Therefore, we are all held closely in the heart of GOD.  Because of this, we can only be do or have, because of GOD.       Let those who wish to remain in hate and fear continue to do so.  You must make the decision to follow Christ the way GOD intended, with love, mercy, and forgiveness.  If your friends, refuse to be the light of Christ in your life, then you be the light of Christ in theirs.  Understand that you can influence others, but never let other influence you.   If you would like, you can visit www.savedfw.com to download a free ebook on the very subject we are talking about.      And always remember this, it is not what other people say or do to you that matters, it is what you say and do to others that matters.  That includes yourself.|`|QsCPOHAraa	It sounds to me like you're realizing the insanity of religion first-hand. Christianity loves the desperate, broken-down people with addictions and criminal backgrounds. They just gobble them up and give them a new addiction - God! An illusion.    It also sounds to me like you're too smart to go along with all of this nonsense.    I recommend that if you're searching for God, simply do it on your own without a third party in between. You came along way without religion, so you should already know that it's neither necessary nor actually helpful for someone with an inquisitive mind. It's only a distraction, a diversion from discovering the truth independently.    Abandon these so-called friends, and their religion too. That's my advice.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Remember, Jesus loves you.

TROLL ALERT|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	Your "friends" are giving you conflict and hatred, not unlike some of the answers here that rail against Christians (as though what you describe is Christian).    One can wear the label "Christian" and do it poorly.  Jesus teaches us to love one another as we would be loved.  If this sounds completely incompatible with what you are describing, that's because it is.    In other words, this isn't Christianity whatsoever.  Nor is it friendship.  Both of these terms are (like most anything else in this world) easily abused and used by people who don't understand a thing about them.  None of this has anything to do with Christianity, religion in general or any such thing.  Do NOT make the mistake of believing this behavior is representative of God because it is in DIRECT conflict with what we are commanded to do.    It doesn't matter what I wear, if I'm not authentically what I claim then I'm something else altogether - along with a deceiver of myself.

There are some believers who only read a handful of the bible, and then feel they have the bible knowledge to lead, making mistakes out of pride and causing people to lose confidence in Christianity. Now my question is this? . .  do you believe in the bible?  If so then you need to find Bible studies. . you can find them on the web for free, bookstores, and other places.  A person can say all that they want to try and convince you, but if your mind and heart are made up then it dosn't matter what they say.  If you are serious to learn truth, then take a leap of faith and pray about it with a sincere heart. What do you have to lose??  Another thing to remember is that Jesus was not only recognized by the bible, but by history as well.   Thousands of people witnessed him do miracles that were never done before.  At the age of 12 he was teaching to adults in the temples. Jesus claimed to be the Son of God and was killed because of this.  In that time people feared talking about Jesus because they could be thrown in Jail, tortured, or killed.  But they did anyway because they seen the things he had done.  Now put yourself in their shoes a moment. . would you have testified to the things he had done knowing that you are putting yourself in harm.  If you didn't see him do these things would you have testified to your own demise?  Probably not. . that is why i believe this is a great reason for the truth of Jesus.    To judge your friendships remember this quote from scripture.. .    You will know them by their own fruits.  If they are putting you down instead of trying to lift you up and help your spirituality, then they are not practicing the Love of God.  But I don't know them! maybe their intentions are for you, but they are not expressing themselves in the positive manner they should be.    Heres a great website to check out    http://www.christianityoasis.com/Keyword...                God Bless You and I hope you are lead in the right direction to hapiness.

We just refuse to be associated with some of the more lunatic innovations of the fundamentalist Churches, or the ossified power-structures and doctrines of others. We have a respect for tradition and Scripture, but we also recognise the need to engage with the society we live in.    Having a sane and reasonable theology does not mean that we are not passionate about our beliefs and our commitments to the Church and to the world. Anyone who has experienced a choral Eucharist in the ancient splendour of Westminster Abbey, or a quiet Taize prayer service in a Cambridge college chapel, or read the thorny, tormented  poetry of a John Donne or a Geoffrey Hill, or humbly walked the way of the pilgrims to Canterbury or Walsingham could not possibly think that Anglican spirituality is "lukewarm."

Now, the REAL question is - when God punishes your sins, will you still be holding on to them?    Jesus can set you free from your sins, but if you reject His offer and you hold on to those sins in THIS life, then in the NEXT life, those very same sins will hold on to YOU; and if you don't let go of them NOW, then THEY won't let go of YOU, later!     So, when God DOES send those sins to hell, they will drag you, kicking and screaming, with them.    Now to your 2nd question, "why do bad things happen?"  Because we live in a sin filled world.  You decide whose side you will be on, God or sin (i.e. bad).  Just don't blame God when the consequences of sin (that HE is offering to forgive you for, and set you free from) finally catches up to you.

bb06GQ5Paa	If you aren't getting your needs met at that church, then you should switch.      My pastor in Dallas lives 30 miles away from the church, is the dean of religious studies at the college in his hometown but every Sunday morning and afternoon, Wednesday afternoon, or any other day he is needed, he is there.  He always has time for his church members day or night.

I know when we tithed regularly and my husband was a deacon we were invited to everything but some of the single moms whose kids needed fatherly guidance and who couldn't afford to tithe were left out alot.  I'm sure if one of the elders needed him he would be there in a flash.  I'm sorry you are going through this and personally I would seek another church.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	You pastor is going about it all wrong. A pastor cannot and should not personally do it all. A pastor's job is to equip the saints for service. Then the equipped saints can go out and do their job.    In our church, the mission statement is pretty much, "bring them in, build them up, send them out". There's absolutely no way a pastor could have as much of an outreach to the community by himself as an active church body could.     Our church has groups of various types to support others and these groups are directed by our pastor.    There are groups that outreach to the community also. Many are involved in various capacities.     I think your pastor is going to burn himself out if he keeps trying to do it all on his own.     My advice? Pray for your pastor. Share your concerns also. Be willing to learn how to be used as well.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	Let me preface my own remarks by saying I also agree 100% with "Mike Matney" who I believe posted immediately before me...    It depends on what sort of church you go to.  This can be a problem from time to time, especially if a pastor is really good.  Everyone wants their time!    I can tell you don't go to Catholic church, so we'll omit that.    If you go to a protestant church, there is a committee that is normally in charge of "personnel" type issues.  For instance, in my United Methodist church, there is something called Staff Parish Relations Committee.  This team supports the pastor and assistant pastor, making sure they have what they need to be successful.  They also are the team that the congregation can bring problems, complaints and suggestions to in regards to the pastors or those in ministry.    Normally, the first thing members are told is to confront the pastor with what they have to say.  If they prefer not to do so, the member documents what they have to say, signs it and then it goes into the team for them to work with the pastor and the member together.    Now, if you got to a non-denominational church, you are probably completely out of luck.  These churches have no structure that is consistent from church to church; it seems like it on the face of things, but each church basically makes it's own rules and enforces them as they see fit at the end of the day.  This is a problem because unless you are long-time members WITH a lot of reputation and respect, whether or not you are taken seriously is entirely up to whoever you speak with about a matter.  The fundamental problem is that each church doesn't answer to ANYONE except for whoever is in power at that particular physical address at any give moment.  This not only means personnel issues but doctrinal issues as well.    I suggest speaking directly with your pastor about this first.  If you don't feel you are getting the recourse you envision, then do the following based on what type of church you are in:  if part of a denomination, find out what body or team deals with such issues and speak with them.  If part of a non-denominational church, find out if such a body exists and take the problem to them.  if such a body does not exist, then I would search for another church and FIRST research how that church is constructed in terms of power and who the pastor and ministry leaders ultimately answer to.  This will help avoid problems in the future.  After all, moving your family to another church after investing a lot of time at another one can be a very difficult thing.    God bless you.|`|4Mg2sSdkaa	You should stop looking to mind control cults and cult leaders for advice and guidance.|`|b8pd8EdAaa	I think you should pray about it.

In my church the leader of the congregation, the Bishop, has a full time job and a family.  He always finds time to visit and meet members.  The less active they are, the more important they are to him.  The day I moved into the area, after six members unloaded the truck, he and his counselor were at the door to welcome me.  In the first month I had two appointments with him and received a calling.  If I can expect this out of a volunteer, you ought to receive no less.
aqJJbciQaa	To save people searching I will paste it here.     Christianity as many other religions are based upon older religions.     1Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.     2Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:     3Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:     4Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:     5Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.     6Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.     7At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.     8They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.     9Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.     10He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.     11They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.     12By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.     13He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.     14He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;     15And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.     16The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;     17Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.     18The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.     19He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.     20Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.     21The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.     22The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.     23Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.     24O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.     25So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.     26There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.     27These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.     28That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.     29Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.     30Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.     31The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.     32He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.     33I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.     34My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.     35Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more.

The only Christianism more self-evidently ridiculous is snake-handling Pentecostalism. with catholicsim you have a priesthood rife with pedophiles and closeted gay priests that attacks homosexuality, you have your ex-Hitler Youth Pope, your praying to idols, a large segment of catholics wanting the Pope to make Mary co-redeemer with Christ, praying to dead people (the Bible has the death penalty for necromancy), you have your forbidding people to marry which Paul called a "doctrine of devils" in 1 Tim 4. It's the most ancient and yet most demonstrably corrupt and un-Biblical of the widely known churches, all because it became a political arm of the empire and concerned it self with power more than with piety, and as such remains an object lesson on what happens when church and state fornicate.

The Pope has always been a big controversy with Protestants. They don't like him interfering. Of course, they now fail to realize that the Pope doesn't do much interfering. We listen to what he has to say but most of us make up our own minds. That's why 98% of Catholic women around the world use contraception even though the Pope says we shouldn't.    The Bible is a book. A book can't hate anyone. That's just silly.    I find it interesting and even comical that those who object to Catholicism here blame things that happened over 500 years ago for their dislike. How foolish. As for helping the Nazis escape Europe, how about the 20,000 or so Jews who were hidden in the Vatican, even if what you say, which I doubt, is true?    Over the years, Catholics have added NOTHING to the bible. Protestants HAVE REMOVED things from the bible.     And only someone uneducated would claim that the bible has nothing to do with Catholicism.    Tom K makes great sense.    Yes, other CHRISTIAN religions have killed, and persecuted, others in the name of religion. To think that doesn't go on in their own religions is to deny the truth and denying the truth doesn't fix anything.

It is from Man, not God.    edit- Since I don't subscribe to ANY Mainstream Christianity, I can tell you it has nothing to do with unity in hating the RCC.

There is not one word in the Bible that advocates the changing of the Sabbath and yet the Catholic Church did just that and has deceived the whole world.    I do not believe the Catholic Church, and therefore the Protestant churches that came from her, is really a thing of God, I think it is a subversion of the true meaning and message.  Why was the symbol of Christianity changed from the sign of the Fish, which Jesus himself used, to the sign of the Cross?    Why are we lighting candles and directing prayers to these dead people that the church decided to call Saints?  I could go on and on but you get the point.

NYGDQ3ezaa	First, prayers are not just about asking God to do stuff for you. If you are a Christian, prayer is about having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. This means you can talk with Him throughout the day, pray anytime as situations need help. Prayer can be praising God with thanks for all His blessings to you, songs to Him, confessing your sins to Him at least daily and asking forgiveness, praying for others, as well as praying to ask for help. It is important not to forget the confessing of sins and the praise/thanks to God. God doesn't just want to hear complaints but of your joys and hopes, gratitude and repentance. Prayers don't always work. Answers to prayer depend on God's will. If the prayer is God's will at this time, you could get a good outcome. Otherwise, He may wait, or change the results for His will. His will is best.   You can pray to God the Father and end your prayer "in Jesus' name, amen." to send the prayer through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Look up "biased sampling", that explains any such opinion.|`|aEdkaXmtaa	praying is like shooting in the dark|`|sKXzYvaRaa	Prayer works at the same rate as random chance (or depending on how hard you work for what you pray for).

AA11297267	OK, total honesty:    The evidence that there was a real person named Jesus (or something close to it) who lived around 2,000 years ago is extremely weak.  No other reliable sources mention anything about him outside of the bible, which in every branch of historical study makes historians extremely skeptical.      Still, it's quite possible that there was indeed some kind of teacher, rabbi, or rebel with that name or something close to it upon which the stories are based.  Not probable, but possible.    As far as the "son of god" thing -- it's extremely unlikely.  There's no evidence to support that notion, and the bible itself gives very good clues that the "divinity" of jesus was a creation of those who came after him, and not something that the character himself taught.    So it's possible there was a real person upon which the stories are based, but not certain.  It's highly unlikely that IF such a person existed there was anything divine or supernatural about him.    Peace.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	The only evidence that Jesus of Nazareth was a real person who performed real miracles is the bible.

Being son is only a title to any of the sons of Abraham whom God will choose to sit on the throne of David and anyone who disobey His laws who is on the throne, will be be flogged by his own men.

Flavius Josephus, Jewish historian of the 1st century, wrote of Jesus' and his followers preaching including James being cut in half with the sword (also mentioned in the Bible).  He quoted the Acts of Pilate about Jesus' crucifiction.    Roman historian Ireneus wrote of Christian religions numbering about 80 denominations and sects by 120 AD (Revelation and the letters, gospel of John were written 96-98 AD).    There is a lot more evidence than you think of Jesus and his followers and the Bible.    However, in the 4th century AD, Christendom began to adopt pagan teachings heavily...a huge concentrated effort to get all pagans into the RC church....hence the confusion that some having claiming true Christian apostles did not know Jesus (Muslim argument).....

W0rcm3awaa	To be honest you're fine to leave catholicism. I mean really its the belief and thought that bind you. Besides from what you're saying i take it that you haven't been confirmed so you're free to go.    Confirmation is when you decide to stay catholic, if you don't then you can be whatever you'd like - say buddhist. In buddhism there really isn't such a thing as 'conversion' or 'converting' its just - live your life by the eightfold path and various other elements and you are, in a sense. It's about the practice.    When it comes to buddhism i'd say go to your library and get out as many books as you can on buddhism - first learn about the historical buddha himself, siddhartha gautama, and the basics of buddhism itself. Read as much as you can knowledge is a useful tool.    In the meantime meditation is a good thing to get started. Some beginner places that are good jumping off points include reading meditation now or never - i think its pretty good for meditation and also try dailybuddhism.com it has a good podcast.    I agree, its not that all religions are wrong or anything i think that the right religion varies per person, and buddhism is right for me, and also you apparently :D    If you would like to talk more about buddhism or you have any other questions feel free to message me, i wish you the best of luck.|`|3r252UIRaa	Start practicing Buddhism and take refuge in the Three Jewels.

You will go to Hell forever because of this; you are denying Christ for a false religion.     A religion that has no after life; a no actual worship, no anything; it's nothingness.  Their symbol is a Circe and ours is a Cross.  A Circle keeps going around and around; doesn't get any larger or smaller; just stays the same; it's nothingness.     When the Cross; it meets in the middle and the forearms of the Cross reach out and will continue to reach out for ever.      We have meditation; we have history, we have the true God; we have God's Law given to us by Moses and then shorten by Peter.  We have the entire liturgy.  When Jesus took the bread and blessed it; it truly became his body; same as every Mass in the world; Catholic/Orthodox; then he took that cup; blessed it and it became his blood; the blood of the new covenant; which the priests do at Mass too; then after he blessed and broke bread and gave the cup; we do the same thing; we pray.  That is meditation.  Adoration in front of the blessed Sacrament every First Friday for an hour; is just like being in the Garden and trying not to sleep.      I can tell you are young, dumb and ignorant about your faith; because you do not understand it; your parents, your God parents didn't teach you about the faith; as they were commanded to do.  Sorry for the harsh words; but you need to study on your own and stop being ignorant and lazy; use the internet to learn about the Catholic/Orthodox Church.        I tell you this with love; so you won't be denied by Jesus; do not become a buddist or anything else; if you do; you will have eternal and forever punishment for ever.|`|PJmpTnlKaa	Do what you want to do.

It is not surprising you have decided to leave there as they themselves left the original faith many years ago by the introduction of many false doctrines and practices.     Buddhism is similar, do a little research on a place called Da'qin in western China and you'll find that Tao descended from the teachings of 2 Christian missionaries of the 6th century, Tao then became Tao Buddhism then simply Buddhism.    My advice is go back to the original source which is those Christian Churches that existed from the beginning and still teach the original faith, such as the Churches of Antioch (Syrian Orthodox) and Alexandria (Coptic Orthodox), both of which predated the Roman Catholics and Buddhism.|`|xxijbx4Waa	the fullness of god's truth is not the catholic church.....it's jesus christ.    may your spiritual walk find its way.|`|zcwSIBHwaa	You don't need to do anything to stop being a Catholic. What is important is what you truly believe, not the rites that you go through. Congratulations for your choosing of Buddhism. And to start to be a Buddhist you don't need to do anything either besides learning the teachings of the Buddha.     It would be useful though to try to make contact with a Buddhist community.

tQxCsitraa	I would suggest going to this site, It's nothing but Robin Hood:http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/lucyjac...    Summary:  Robin Hood is England's most famous outlaw, who robbed from the rich to give to the poor. In Robin Hood's long history, his story has appeared in many forms, from verse to film. His path to outlawry, friends and enemies have been just as diverse. I will first describe the parts of the Robin Hood legend that have remained constant throughout his entire 800 or more year history.    Robin Hood was a Saxon noble, living near the castle of Nottingham. By various means he was forced into a life of banditry, using his cunning and skill-at-arms to relieve bishops, nobles, and servants of the king of gold and jewels levied from the oppressed peasants. Robin collected a band of supporters, his "Merry Men" around him, dressed in green. The members that never cease to appear are Robin himself, Maid Marian, Little John, and Friar Tuck. Along with being a middle-ages Communist, Robin spends his time fighting the cruel Sheriff of Nottingham, and, ultimately, King John, who had usurped the throne from the rightful King, Richard I (Coeur de Lion or Lionheart).
95be5639aed6aa784e4750dbb0a7e356aa	Birth defects caused through "inner breeding" comes from defective genes. Over time, our genes became more corrupted, which causes the defects you speak of. Adam and Eve's genes were perfect, free from genetic defects. Their children's genes as well were pure. As time went on, genetic corruption occurred, and that is why God declared incest to be wrong later on, as a way of protecting us from such defects.|`|cQUT6llpaa	this question kinda confuses me but i will try to answer it..  well God didn't not only Create Adam and Eve.

Too confusing.
uUCTem2Eaa	Yes, but ONLY in Tibetan Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism is Vajrayana Buddhism, which makes up only 6% of Buddhists worldwide. It is a relatively recent development in the history of Buddhism as a whole.    The Buddha taught, among the three marks of existence, the doctrine of anatta, or "no soul".    Reincarnation involves a soul.  Rebirth does not.    The reason Tibetan Buddhists use the terms interchangably is because they either reject, or, more often, are ignorant of the doctrine of anatta.    As a Dhammayutika (Theravada) Buddhist, the interchangable use of the term is immensely irritating to me.|`|W0rcm3awaa	I'm a nice person and i think there is good in everyone and that everyone has potential. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt but you've long since worn that out in me. I've already explained that they're different things.    You can't say plantains and bananas are pretty much the same thing just because they're from the same family and they're long and yellow, they're still different and the same is true for rebirth and reincarnation. You've been acting like a child on here attacking others beliefs both religiously, politically, and otherwise. I say a child because when children learn something new its the focus of their attention for ages and they rub it in everyones face, and you've asked so many questions on this single topic simply just to 'rub it in'. I'm sorry if you're going through something in your life right now but taking it out on other people solves nothing.    Also one temple does not speak for all buddhism, so maybe your tibetan buddhist temple does not distinguish but just about all others do, so sorry. As i've read through m ny of the other answers on your various questions i'm not the only one who says this and whose come to this knowledge.     I wish you luck and i hope you feel better.|`|pqqKLCmwaa	As far as I am concerned they are the same. I think it is the belief of Tibetan Buddhism that a person is almost immediately reborn,. Most westerners who believe in reincarnation , including myself believe we spend some time in the spirit world before returning.|`|AA10276712	Jack, you keep insisting that this is a 'western' distinction. It's NOT. Korean, Chinese and Japanese Buddhist masters made the distinction LONG before any westerner even considered the differences. Chan Master Sheng-yen, Zen Master Roshi Suzuki Shunry (Shunryu Suzuki), Kalu Rinpoche, Bikshuni Ayya Khema, Ch'an master Hsuan Hua, Seon Master Samu Sunim, Dae Soen Sa Nim Seung Sahn and many other teachers from the East taught the use of the term re-birth, we didnt invent the term ourselves.     To answer your question though, the reason is one of prudence. As I have stated before, reincarnation, as accepted by most westerners and as is taught in Hinduism, is about the self (atman) leaving the dead body and entering a new one.  In fact, the Hindu Bhagavad Gita states: "Worn-out garments are shed by the body; Worn-out bodies are shed by the dweller within the body. New bodies are donned by the dweller, like garments." This shows the belief in the non-ending self. This significantly differs from Buddhas teachings because two of the core teachings of the Buddha are "Anatta" or "not-self" and "Anicca" or Impermanence. When you add them together, the Hindu idea of a permanent self that goes from body to body goes against Buddhist teachings. Even the idea of a permanent, unchanging consciousness goes against Buddhas teachings. The consciousness in a being arises, collapses and arises again moment to moment. The consciousness that arises in a new being is neither identical to, nor different from the consciousness of the old-being, but it is not permanent.     You ask what the difference is and why we make a distinction? The reason is that most western Buddhists, and in fact most Buddhist is general, practice Mahayana or Theravada Buddhism. Most of these practice some form of the Dhyana school (Zen, Chn, Seon, Thi?n, etc...) A fundamental teaching is that there is no self and a statement such as the one you made, "When you die, your consciousness continues." Goes against the core teachings. As a practice, We ask ourselves, "Who am 'I'?" So, we would generally answer your question with a question. Who is the 'You' that dies? What 'consciousness' is there to continue? Thus, for us, the term reincarnation stresses the 'I' and is synonymous with 'self continuation' or 'permanent-self' notions of other religions, the antitheses of the Buddhas teachings. On the other hand, rebirth is free from any notion of self and thus preferred.     Additionally, another reason for specifically using rebirth as opposed to reincarnation is because the average westerner that doesnt understand Buddhism will automatically assume reincarnation means the returning of the self in a new body. (The Hindu concept, if you will.) Since this is, as I have demonstrated, fundamentally incompatible with Buddhism, we use a term that distinctly differentiates the two.     That said, understanding that you and others who practice your form of Buddhism understand the differences but choose to use rebirth and reincarnation interchangeable is fine. It doesnt bother or offend me. I only answer your questions because you ask them and I have an answer to offer. It's not out of displeasure or discord. Likewise I hope your question is posted simply out of curiosity as to the differences in expression and not a bitterness towards our differences.    I hope this helps.

You will feel a great sense of relief when you come out and living as you know yourself to be is empowering.  Living as someone else expects you to live is imprisoning yourself.    The decision is yours.  If it's safe to come out, my opinion is that you should.  But if it puts you in danger, then don't.|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	Do not rush with this one.

I don't know if you live where they have a place called PFLAG. it stands for Parents and Family/friends of Lesbians and Gays. This place has literature in the form of some pamphlets that you can get. They explain different ways of approaching your family, and also has ones you can give them so that they can start to understand you better. If there's not a PFLAG then go on line and see if you can find one. Parents need assistance to adapt to a coming out. Their first thing normally is what did I do to make you this way. Then there is fear for you and the family, fear in the idea that friends and people from church if they go to one will reject them because of you, and fear sometimes leads to anger and they strike out. Usually only verbally but there are cased where it became physical. They may also react so badly that you have to find some place to stay on short notice at least until they can pull themselves together. I would wait until you can read up on coming out suggestions because your very young. If you want to wait tell your friend that it is your choice and you want to wait for a while longer.|`|JjYXy2oqaa	GO DUDE GO!

But if you think they would be accepting of you, sure go for it!  Just remember to test the waters first.  Perhaps bring up the topic of gay rights or gay people.  Do the same with your friends.  Good luck!!!|`|LA3DH16waa	Yea, I'm facing the exact same problem.  I'm 13 (14 in 8 days), and really want to have a boyfriend.  I've decided that I'm going to come out, but as gradually as I can.  I'll tell two or three people, and tell them to try to keep it secret and see how long it takes to get around.  If they actually DO keep it secret, I'll just tell a few more people.  I just don't want to go  to school one day and be normal to everybody and then the next be an outcast.      I would say definitely come out if you really want a partner in your life right now, but if you don't care then what's the rush?  I'm also speaking with my school counselor, which I think is a good idea for anybody. :-)
hjxsX4liaa	Hello  : )    They mean that people should be doing all in their power to not get pregnant, instead of getting pregnant multiple time's and having multiple abortion's.    Peace : )|`|b94573ef3c2d94b3f4ddd867c8a6cc47aa	I guess it is somewhat a form of birth control... but it's not a good one.. I think it can harm the body compared to the contraceptive pill and such..    It is also a last resort since it's a lot like the morning after pill.|`|373KJjiOaa	It means that aborting a healthy fetus just because you did not take the proper precautions while engaging in consensual relations is wrong and irresponsible. That is what I mean when I use that statement.    Abortion is a horrible thing and should only be used if the health of the mother is at stake or if the sexual contact was forced. I would also lean towards using it if the fetus had a deformity that would make life painful for the rest of the child's life.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Maybe we should change the term from "birth control" (which by definition "controls what is /is not born" and change it to contraception ("prevents conception").  One process prevents conception the other process kills a baby.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Yes I think that's the general idea: that you should be responsible and use protection so that you won't get pregnant in the first place.    However the "abortion as birth control" argument, especially when used by pro-lifers, is a tad over the top. Do any of you actually know someone who gets abortions over and over again like this? Do you actually know how uncomfortable or painful the procedure can be? It's not a fun day at the spa! Most women are *not* doing this, and I challenge anyone to provide evidence otherwise. The most common reason for abortions in everyone I know who has had one? Birth control failure. And I don't know anyone who has had more than two abortions.|`|PM23RDycaa	Yes that is what they generally mean of course there are many (religous fundies) who see Birth Control pills/shots/implants as another form of abortion when it is in fact not.     True birth control is to prevent fertilization and conception from taking place.     An abortion is preventing the pregnancy from continuing|`|77NzfiVkaa	Yes they mean that you should do everything possible to not get pregnant in the first place instead of just not using protection because you know you can just get an abortion.    And I completely agree.|`|ulwXFrrJaa	Yes, they are hoping for contraception like the pill or the condom or the depo shot as a responsible method of birth control.  or even the morning after pill.      but abortion should not be used as birth control to cater to your own irresponsibility and poor planning.|`|O7SshRl6aa	I think those folks are trying to say that a person should be using means like condoms, the pill, a diaphram, or abstinence, etc. in order to PREVENT pregnancy, rather than using abortion to terminate a pregnancy.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	last resort    try a pill or condom first|`|wwdllMzYaa	if soemone gets pregnant, KNOWINGLY, KNOWING they will hav an abortion   and does it regularly, thats whats known as 'abortion as birth control;'  because they are replacing using condoms, and the pill etc etc, with having abortions|`|OAqTt0nsaa	Abortion is murder.

fEkKuGlEaa	The understanding of mental illness isn't much better than it was in the Dark Ages, whether the person is religious or not.     Mental illness is often genetic, poorly understood, and rooted in brain damage or brain chemistry, sometimes coupled with or worsened by traumatic life events or environmental damage.     For example, I've struggled with depression my whole life, probably exacerbated by some terrible events in my childhood (cue violin music here). But it's mainly due to a serotonin imbalance. I don't think it's a sin or a possession or a punishment from God. If anything it is a "thorn in the flesh."

I do not think such illnesses as nymphomania, social anxiety disorder, arithmetic learning disorder, obsessive compulsive shopping disorder, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, negrosis (Yeah, believe it or not if one's skin was black you were once considered something on par with a schizophrenic nowadays), homosexuality, masturbation, et cetera are real mental illnesses. It is often times unscientific and just made up off the top of the psychiatrist's or psychologist's head. Homosexuality was considered a mental illness until it was voted off the DSM manual in 1973 after gay rights groups protested the APA diagnosis as homosexuality as a mental illness. I have never heard of someone say something is scientific and then after political pressure back off and say it is no longer a disease because people were offended.
JXMpZiwxaa	Thank you for posting the St. Michael prayer.    I assume you are referring to the devil worshiping Satanists, rather than the LaVeyan or theistic Satanists.  Some people worship Satan because they are rebelling against God.  Note that these devil worshipers always like to obtain a Catholic communion Host for use in a black mass or other Satanic rituals.  Even they know that the CATHOLIC Church has the true Body and Blood of Christ.    I've known people who seem to be possessed by evil spirits.  Sick, deranged look in the eyes, out of control hostility, superhuman strength, fury and rage so intense it paralyzes you when they yell at you. Often they had troubled childhoods and grew up in abusive homes.  As Mary has told us in her apparitions, demonic possession tends to occur in people of WEAK CHARACTER.  Having a good, loving mother, and good role model, is very instrumental in shaping a child's character.    One of the promises of Jesus to those devoted to His Sacred Heart is that He will destroy any evil movements within them.  I also would strongly recommend devotion to the Mother of God.    http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...    St. John Vianney, patron of priests, was seldom seen without a rosary in his hand.    "The rosary is the scourge of the devil" -- Pope Adrian VI    "The rosary is a treasure of graces" -- Pope Paul V    Padre Pio, the stigmatic priest, said: "The Rosary is THE WEAPON"    St. Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort wrote: "The rosary is the most powerful weapon to touch the Heart of Jesus, Our Redeemer, who so loves His Mother."    Pope Pius XII: There is no surer means of calling down Gods blessings upon the familythan the daily recitation of the Rosary.    God bless!

They live by the ideal they do not need god in their lives and that its them first other second.    No turn the other cheek crap. Try reading excerpts from the satanic bible and LEARNING    Do Calvinist worship Calvin?    Do Lutherans worship Martin Luther?    "YOU GO AGAINST GOD AND IF YOU GO AGAINST GOD; THAT IS EVIL; GO WITH GOD; THAT IS GOOD. "    So by that definition Muslims, Hindus, Pagans of ever flavor are evil? Hmm my son doesn't seem to think so unless its bedtime.|`|e4yczpKsaa	Obviously, you don't quite know what satanism is.    "Satanism refers to several concepts, some of which are entirely mythical and others which are actual religious traditions in practice today."

Satanists aren't about worshiping what is bad, and denying what is good. The name is somewhat misleading. Satanists renounce God, not because they serve the devil, but because they believe that they can help themselves, so to say. They aren't "lazy" or "ignorant." They just happen to have a separate point of view. Christianity is in a sense, denial, of what happens in the "real" world. Satanism is an affirmation.|`|HDeUYCnXaa	Alright, you are dumb. just because its named satanism doesn't mean they worship satan.    Are you that dumb not to realize the name? How Stupid are you?

GOD! i hate religious nuts likee you who cant keep to themselves. I dont have anything against what you believe cause its not right to judge people on what they believe.
DR4LYQBtaa	I am not religious.  I feel that no religion is right or true. I don't believe that it could be. I mean all religions are so old and really only passed down from generation to generation. I have no problem with people who are religious although I despise people who push their religion on others. I feel that there is more evidence supporting evolution and the scientific aspect of everything than there is supporting a 'greater being'. Honestly, I don't think that anyone could know for sure that there is a God or gods. There is no one that is alive today that would have came from the time period that God has been said to walk on Earth or whatever. I suppose that is why it is called a belief though. Even though I am not religious, I find myself on various occasions praying to God for this or that or speaking of Him. I think that if you want to believe in a divine power then you should have your own belief and own reasons and not conform to a Church or specific religion. Anymore in today's society churches and religion has become so profit based, publicity based, whatever you want to call it, I don't believe that the first intention of the church is to help people create a relationship with God. It doesn't matter which church you think I'm talking about because I am grouping them all into one. I was born, raised, and confirmed Catholic but prefer to say that I am agnostic.   Definition of agnostic:  1. a. One who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God.  b. One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism.  I am also almost ashamed to actually be Catholic after all the priest and child molestation cases and everything. Another reason that I think any and every Church is somewhat corrupt. If it was all about God and following His ways, then why would anyone do these unspeakable acts?!  I don't see how there can be so many different types of religion either. How can so many people believe different versions of virtually the same thing. But for someone to say this religion is right or this one is wrong is incorrect in my opinion.    You just need to decide what your belief is. If you believe in God, then you can have a relationship with Him without being involved in the Church. Don't let anyone try and infulence your belief or decision either!    Sorry about the length. I just feel very strongly about this and can't even start to express my true feelings on this through text.|`|Vhfb7UACaa	No, I'm not religious I'm spiritual.|`|krkpHSOhaa	No|`|PlzqUZ5faa	Certainly Not!!!|`|8qQpBYg6aa	No! i hate religion     I am however with all my heart a christian|`|rxGhvqyvaa	Truth is all in perspective.

I used to be a "christian" but that was only because of my mom.  she totally drilled that into me for like 11 years.    I finally got over her trying to get me to believe in her religion.    I started out being agnostic (if you don't know what that means it means your "religion" is up in the air) but lately I've felt like I kind of want to be athiest..because that's what I've started to believe.    I don't think that there is really a "true" religion..it's whatever YOU think is real or not.    Also, to the lie thing, for everyone it's different.  It's all based on opinion.

However trying to find God through religion is doomed to failure.  Religion is about man trying to do works in order to please God and gain his favor.  This is impossible however as God only will accept people who come to him through his way.    Romans 3:23 says:  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God    Romans 6:23 says:  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.    and Ephesians 2:8-9 says the following:  For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithand this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God not by works, so that no one can boast.    So everyone has sinned and everyone is deserving of death and everlasting punishment.  God does not want this however and sent his son Jesus Christ to pay the penalty for you.  That is why Jesus was crucified, and if you believe that he died for your sins then God can give you eternal life.    Romans 4:5  But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.    This verse clearly shows that it is faith and not any type of work (going to Church, confessions, giving money, doing good deeds, etc) that is the key.  Your faith then in Christ Jesus will counted for righteousness, and that is the only kind of righteousness that God accepts.|`|7sOHAZU9aa	yes , i think there is a God , think about it , the universe is unique, every thing it contains.  for example, the electron revolves around the nucleus while revolving around it's  , the exact same way the earth revolves around the sun ,could it be just a coincidence, could all this beauty, be just a result of some accident.  the earth revolves around the sun with a very critical angle, that if it changed even for one degree , we would either burn or freeze to death.    sir francis bacon said: a little philosophy inclines men's mind to atheism, but depth in philoshy brings men's mind to religion        i'm a muslim , i didn't say that at the beginning cos whenever people hear muslim, they think terrorism,it's a shame cos Islam is the exact opposite of terrorism , the arabic world Islam means submitting your your soul to God and from that submission you gain peace .    i believe in science and islam has never contradicted science for example it  explains embryonic development way before science has discovered it for example THIS IS A VERSE FROM THE GLORIOUS QURAAN :    We created man from an extract of clay.

I was about 7, 8 yrs old and it was Thanksgiving and there was a little "situation" with a pedophile if you know what I mean, and so we were planning to have a bonfire so we went to a park, and actually started one in a BBQ pit and so we burnt all the picture of us and that man, gifts, everything that reminded us of him. And at the end, we prayed and I prayed (my exact words) "I pray the fire will burn like crazy" and so we went to our friend's house to eat, and hang out, and before we left back home (another city/town), we went and saw the fire. And it had been 8hrs, and the fire was still burning, like crazy.    And then, also, on Christmas day, it had been snowing in Corpus Christi, TX, so we were amazed, but we lived in Seadrift (small town, same as the last story) and so we were driving back to Seadrift and there was a bridge, and a deisel was on the other lane and so we were just driving, and my little brother wasn't in his seatbelt, and he was laying there sleeping, and so then we drove, across a piece of ice, and we started spinning (my mom had been on cruise control, which made it spin) and we were just holding on and screaming while the car spun around like an out of control roller coaster. And then when it stopped spinning, we got out and checked all around the car and there wasn't a dent or a scratch or ANYTHING. We could've easily fell over the bridge. And then the diesel driver just sat there in astonishment, so my mom went and told him all of us were okay, and then when my mom got back my little brother woke up and asked what happened. And we took it off cruise control and drove home w/our Christmas miracle.    There's a ton more and I can e-mail them to you, but that's my personal proof.

So from my perspective everyone is religious in one way or another.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	No , I dont wear a head scarf , but I follow the dietary law.  I believe that there is one God.  I believe submission to peace is the truth. It is not a religion.  I believe it is the full truth because Science has proven it and it has proven Science , everything makes sense in it.  I believe it makes me a good person. Or at least a better one.    Submission to peace is  the English translation for Islam.    I really love religious Jewish , and Christian people. But the reason I did not choose those paths is because when I was reading from the Torah , the sentence that said " boiling a child in its mothers milk , is not to be done " really caught my attention. I sort of agreed with it and was considering the religion. I found that the next one was " Thou shallt not buy grape products from Non Jews " in the dietary law. Now that is not the truth , nor a religion. Its a club , to get them out the hands of Egyptians. But I still respect them for preserving the religion.    As for Christians which claim to be a Monotheistic religion , I dont think so , How can it be that you believe in God and believe Jesus is god. And then again Adam is your father , but you also call Jesus your father. Thats just too confusing. Theres a God up there , and there was a God here once. Sound pretty Pantheistic to me.      Leave it from that ; looking towards Hinduism I see that there is an " Atheist Hindu " here , Theres not much change to Hinduism when you take out the million Gods ( Hanuman , Saraswati , Kali ma , Shiva , Shama , Devi ma , Ganesh and it goes on ). They just like the colorful " Holi " that you put on your face and that red bindi , with the colorful flower necklaces. Its a game ; thats why little children pick up on it so quickly.    As for other religions ; like Bhuddism its just another very spirtual less decorative version of Hinduism.    As for my religion :   Adam is father.  Eve is mother.  Jesus is a prophet.  Mohammed was the last prophet who accepts all prophets ( Abraham , Noah , Jacob , Joseph etc. ) in Judaism and Christianity.  The Quran is text that hold religion , laws , and even proper ways to clean things from your teeth to the middle of your toes.    We do believe in the big bang. But it sounds very much like the Greek story ( which is insane ) when you just say " Two rocks clash , and BANG! We're here! And the wind blows .. because it feels like it , and we have no God , we made it up , and theres nothing! Just our lives , and family. So take out all that junk , Ramadan , Eid , Christmas , because we're made from germs and went to bugs and then gorrilla's. So .. yeah!    All in all ; I really love religious people , but I was just reasoning why I love my religion.    :)|`|421cVKcpaa	Nope.

nRIsTdfIaa	I can see the logic, but only barely...    Yes, both procedures end the pregnancy.. but then, so does labor and delivery.    I have to agree with the whole intent thing- one wants only one life at the end, the other wants two (or if there's twins, 3..).    Speaking of which- what about a "failed abortion"- where the fetus doesn't die/isn't destroyed? What are the current care options for the baby in that scenario? I know US laws have been back and forth on this one.    (My personal vote is to go ahead and provide post-natal care for the child, place the baby for adoption by anyone EXCEPT family-- I feel that adoption should actually be a FIRST option in an unwanted pregnancy!)|`|8ef3756c794596b7f47f630067b164c0aa	It is carried out to save the life of the baby and mother, not to kill the baby like abortion.|`|847ab32dc15c849d022c11323ad7db39aa	Yeah, but the goal of a c-section isn't to kill the fetus.

It's one of the most common procedures (arguably top 3, depending on how technical you get) performed in the US and other countries.    Abortion terminates a pregnancy. A C-section is not performed with the intent to prevent the fetus from growing any further.

With abortion, the time frame is usually rather early in the pregnancy, before the fetus is independently viable. The intent is to remove the consequences of a choice.    With a C-section, the time frame is typically at or near full-term. The desired outcome is a happy healthy mother, and a living (hopefully healthy child.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	The baby isn't murdered in a C-section.

AA10031161	Pregnancies sometimes happen unintentionally. Think about it!    Sometimes, the women who have these unintentional pregnancies don't want the subsequent months of illness, discomfort, and (sometimes permanent) disfigurement.    Sometimes the father or even the mother's parents or legal guardians don't want the other complications that often come with parenthood and force the woman/girl to get an abortion.    I sincerely don't think that any woman would intentionally get pregnant with the plan to abort the pregnancy.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	INTENT, in anyone's book, is the INTENT to do something, not the ACT.    If one INTENDS to abort, then changes one's mind, then one has NOT committed ANYTHING...murder, abortion, birth control, or anything else.    And how did a C-section question prompt responses about abortion?  The purpose of a C-section is to bring a live baby into the world, without killing the mother.  Hardly abortion/murder/ or anything ELSE sinful.|`|dvY6UfiYaa	I don't think any woman gets pregnant just so they can have the joy of "murdering" their own baby..

One can't murder what isn't a human being.    It's not about "killing a baby" it's about terminating a pregnancy -- because the woman doesn't want to carry and give birth to the baby, can't take care of it; is in danger from the pregnancy or birthing process; because the resulting baby would be severely mal-formed and have poor quality of life. The reasons vary.    No one gets pregnant in order to abort; it's unwanted pregnancy that leads to most abortions.|`|ccZuEOEfaa	NO. The intent is not murder, not at all.  Abortion has more to do with a woman wanting to be able to raise her child better. She might feel that she is too young, too poor, too addicted to drugs or something to raise the child well.  Just because she gets an abortion doesn't mean that she wanted to murder a child.|`|AA11796124	>    The intent of an abortion is to destroy the life of an unborn child.

And I hear about abortions being necessary to save the mother's life, but most of the time those situations could be solved with a C section, thus saving the mother and baby.    EDIT  Maybe I'm missing something, but how is a C section a form of abortion?|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	Abortion kills the baby, so yeah its intent is to "get rid" of the baby so its murder.  If the "doctor" killed the mom instead, he'd be in trouble, so why is it ok to kill the baby?|`|IYe1TTwYaa	Abortion for the women is based upon fears, fear of not being a good parent, fear of not not having to supplies to supply to baby's needs, fears of embarrassment.  Abortion for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers is love of money, pure greed masked as a good deed. They have earned hundreds of billions of dollars killing babies.   Either way an innocent baby looses it's life.

I think Jesus implied that the legalistic backbone of jewish law is no longer as binding, for example, not being allowed to do stuff on the sabbath or restricting pork from your diet. I think Jesus was basically saying that he wants us to have a general spirit of love and compassionate, rather than displaying righteousness through strict laws. All ethics should come from the heart.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	They are the 10 COMMANDMENTS, not 10 SUGGESTIONS, enough said.

No taking an innocent life. No stealing and lying.  These are common sense rules that just makes a person a good person to his family, himself and society.     Genesis 20:22 (NASB) God told Moses that he is to tell the sons of Israel.    The sons of Israel are all the descendents=us. So God's word stands forever.  No ifs, ands, or buts.

Now take the stick out and put Jesus in that sentence.  What changed?  A word.  Then why is one a crutch and the other not a crutch?  Does this image help you to understand why we say what we say?    A belief in God makes you wait for something that won't be happening any time soon.  It causes you to wait for something supernatural instead of taking your own life in your hands and standing up for yourself.  All the guilt trips make you miss out on really living - and no, I'm not talking about drugs or booze or sex.  I'm talking about the absolutely empowering feeling of being able to make your own decisions and act on them without worrying about the sky pilot looking over your shoulder in disapproval.

I don't mean to sound rude but if I wanted to know something, I would ask.     "I'm looking for personal opinions- are these actions by Christians justified by the fact that they believe in eternal torture for those who do not follow and accept Jesus and the teachings of the Bible? Are their words excusable because they feel they are doing what's best?"    I understand their attempt to help, but I know better than to assume they are all trying to help. Some get scared at the things we say (god is fake, no after life, no real meaning for being here, etc.), and retaliate just to comfort themselves, while others will never admit to being wrong and will argue no matter what the topic is over.    "Or is this urging of others to accept their god and Christ in any way disrespectful? Do you see it as arrogant?"    It is not only disrespectful but offensive to those who choose to believe something different. I don't go around knocking on doors and hunting down christians only to preach to them how their religion is wrong, I only answer questions when asked, and I would appreciate the same respect when in the opposing situation. Although most religious people follow this example, there are those annoying few who feel the need to take everybody else under their wing.    "Though I no longer have belief in Jesus, hell/heaven, etc, I was once Christian, and the idea of eternal suffering is a horrible concept. I can understand their concern"    It's grateful of them to be concerned for others, but they need to accept there is nothing they can do and move on. If an athiest ever decides to find god, or if they have some ephiany that will lead them to one, it won't be because they were preached at by some bible-hugging, world-christainizing, church goer. Christans, and other religious people, need to stop worrying about saving all these non-religious people, and worry about their own business.    That isn't to say it's annoying when an athiest shoves his/her beliefs into somebody else's face. It's annoying on either end. That is why I think we all should just mind our own business and stop trying to demean what others think. There is no proof that either is right, or either is wrong. We should all just leave it at that.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27.

Not all are the same.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	oh, Jesus was asked the same question, to which he replied.     do not stop them, let them do it. for those that be for us are not against us.|`|T9vf2uU7aa	You can't be mad at those who preach if that's all they've known their entire life.  They don't know they're being disrespectful or intrusive because they've been told by the "good book" to do so.  Why would there be any second guessing on their part about whether or not they should preach?  If they believe that what they're doing will earn them eternal happiness and security, as long as it doesn't infringe upon the rights or comfort of others (or health, because we all know how bad suicide bombers are for one's health), and, as long as they choose the proper time, place, and person, then I don't see any reason they shouldn't be allowed to spread their word.

And they should never condemn you or tell you that you're wrong (because THEY could be the ones who are wrong). I find that totally disrespectful, arrogant, hurtful, and just plain mean. Besides, I've heard Christians claim that they won't even remember those who go to hell.

Holidays are pagan, cross is pagan, etc.    Debbie  debbiepittman@yahoo.com|`|qKSn0AVsaa	Are you a "True" Christian if you do not spread the word of God? We were all commissioned to preach the Good News of Gods Kingdom.    CHRISTIANS are commanded to "make disciples of people of all the nations," but this does not mean that they are to use pressure or convert others by force. Jesus' commission was to "tell good news to the meek ones," to "bind up the broken-hearted," to "comfort all the mourning ones." (Matthew 28:19; Isaiah 61:1, 2; Luke 4:18, 19)     It is LOVE for our neighbours that compels us to tell all whom we meet about this good news. It is important to not confuse arrogance with exuberance.   Example; if your neighbours house was on fire and they were not aware.   Because of your knowing the importance of the message, would you not be eager to tell them the message to get out from the burning home?    This of course is only an example but it does stress why some are so eager for you to hear what they know.    I hope this helped?|`|PlzqUZ5faa	they should do it in the Ramadan section

UL3XOKJxaa	Jesus..God's Riches At Christ Expense =GRACE. Without Jesus there is no attonement for sin...that is important. God Bless|`|9mLjDa5kaa	A FREE GIFT.     Everything is by  the Lord's grace.  Salvation and every single blessing in our lives, including the very next breath we take. Every blessing is also only by His grace, and cannot be earned.  Always ask the Lord to give you things FOR FREE  :)     Grace is a free gift, and it is not "earned" by works, otherwise it wouldn't be grace.  Grace and works are OPPOSITES (Romans 11:6).    Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|oVHFz52Laa	It is His great mercy and love that we do not deserve. It is not a license to sin. It is a free gift, we could never earn it. We can lose it if we do not stay with Christ.

JvHqtKjSaa	The Book of Romans clearly states that homosexuality is wrong. It is "dishonoring"  to the body, "unclean", and "UNSEEMLY" (which means it shouldn't be happening)... nothing is taken lightly when it comes to interpreting the Bible. Every Word God speaks is very important, and believe it or not... He makes these rules to make OUR lives better!    It most certainly does! Maybe if you just tried living righteously, you'd see how wonderful it really is. Everything is so much better and more clear-cut than it was before. No more falling for peer-pressures or anything like it. God tells me what to do to make me really happy, and i couldn't be more thankful :) He would do it for anyone, if only they would listen. Pls open your heart to Him.. TRUST me. you would be so happy, and NEVER have to worry about... anything! :) Isn't that the most wonderful way to live your life?    ok.. so first of all. it's not judging. im not gonna hate gays or lesbians for who they are, because God still loves them, and wants the very best for them.. which is why us Christians are here to help :) and God is never selfish and unfair. Why would you think that? Sometimes we have to experience hardships.. but its only to help us grow. With no suffering there would be no compassion, therefore, no love and caring.    Are you talking to me? cause i never said anything about gross.. and no. my children would never be raised to think that way. its based on outside experiences and my children will be raised by the Word of God... not by the words of the negatively influential world around us. If you put God first, no one will come in your way.    My children will choose how they live their lives. and i plan on raising them to know right from wrong. and they will, and will be very happy. because like i said... there is no true happiness without God in your life!    I'm not trying to pick a fight. so i will end this letting you know that i prayed for you and will continue :) God Bless.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	lesbians are great and i couldn't give a toss if a person is gay or not|`|qbelhflAaa	For the Bible tells them so.|`|DArAz67Caa	what happened to grammar--??  anyhow----I follow the word of GOD----perhaps you should give it a try--|`|7mhRDbvsaa	because it is abnormal    i'm use to seeing a man and a women at the pulpit about to get married    and seeing the same sex gets married is like cancer to my eyes|`|ff545BLyaa	I say whatever, i am catholic.

Satan was given free will.|`|bZud91iuaa	I'm not a Christian and while the majority of Christians believe that "God" created evil, I do not. If God did create good and evil they would have been created at the exact same moment, and yet evil or the fall from grace occurred after the so-called creation.  The nice story of Adam & Eve describes the "choice" of these two beings to eat from a tree of knowledge and introducing evil into paradise. If evil had been created by God then it would be co-created at exactly the same moment as good.  God would not have sat around and said, "well it's sure boring here with just these two goody two shoes (or bare feet) lounging in my garden, think I'll create evil." Even the Bible states "and He saw it was Good." So if it was good why mess it up?|`|baa198aacdf80ead59f8f0fea0ada6f8aa	The University professor challenged his students with this question"Did God create everything that exists?"A student bravely replied, "Yes he did!"God created everything?" The professor asked,Yes sir", the student replied:The professor answered, "If God created everything, then God created evil, since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are, then God is evil."The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor, quite pleased with himself, boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.Another student raised his hand and said, "Can I ask you a  question professor?"Of course", replied the professor:The student stood up and asked, "Professor does cold exist?"What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never been cold?" The students snickered at the young man's question:The young man replied, "In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460? F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat."The student continued, "Professor, does darkness exist?"The professor responded, "Of course it does."The student replied, "Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton 's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a   term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present."  Finally the young man asked the professor, "Sir, does evil exist?"Now uncertain, the professor responded, "Of course as I have already said. We see it everyday. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.  To this the student replied, "Evil does not exist sir, or at least is does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light."The professor sat down.The young man's name -- Albert Einstein (gotta love 'em)|`|e4ef6e28e838dad7d38eeeff4eb720e4aa	The KEY to most concepts is found in the basic understanding of God. All the whys refer back to the "CONCEPT" you have about God. Without a SOLID foundation how can one build ?      Let's deal with a BASIC rationalization.        Since all things came from God, then the devil himself also came from God. When Darkness ( chaos, confusion, etc...) was upon the face ( God ) of the deep, God separated the things inside Him. The most outstanding darkness is known to us as the devil. The outstanding Light is known to us as Jesus.        All the good in the world comes from Jesus.      All the bad in the world came from the devil.        SEPARATION ! All was manifest in the spiritual realm, and is being manifested in the natural realm. This separation process has been going on in the natural realm since the revealing of Satan, so all can SEE and judge.        Romans 1:20 says : For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so they are without excuse.        This same separation is what is expected of Christians. We are to do introspection constantly, dividing the good from the evil. The darkness from the light. Replacing ignorance with understanding. We are to REVEAL what is in us, and judge. That righteous judgment is given to us by the Word .    Peace and love...|`|5eGE4AkLaa	Not specifically, but he did create angels with free will, and Satan is a fallen angel who sinned against god and causes evil.

She wanted her to know that she was disgusting and abnormal and she needed to get herself to see a shrink. When she told her dad later he asked her if she had actually been involved or were just curious. She told him yes she has a girl friend and they are sexual. She was waiting for the explosion from him, he got up went over to her gave her a hug ruffled her hair and said well your still my baby girl and if you need help or an ear to bend I'm here.

It's better than not to have God at all. You won't lose anything to believe. Only your being proud.  As the bible says, we don't need to see to believe. Whether it's part of a religious product and it is a form of business to some, it teaches humanity to be good, moral and makes this world a better and more peaceful place to live. So, why should we complain or question. Unless we are really ignorant about that matter.|`|8DCslWmMaa	Yup- I did know this about God. All figure-head Gods are made-up.  God is/are the personification of something more deep, natural and spiritual.  Somewhere humanity lost their connection with Spirit and started to be ruled by the ego and not the heart & soul. Humanity also did not want to take personal responsibility or think about what is morally correct so they needed 'someone' to tell them how to be and they needed 'someone' to blame for when they were bad- thus the birth of the Devil.    'god' is real if you look at it from a different perspective.  (read Simulations of God by John C Lilly)    Religion is an illusion, made by man and his confusion- it has become a tool to control the masses.    Not so long ago, the Vatican sold 'get into heaven' tickets-  Get your 'sin redemption' tickets here for only $3!!! ROFLMAO|`|b94573ef3c2d94b3f4ddd867c8a6cc47aa	Yeah.. I know..=P  But those religious peoples don't..|`|43803d780ffc252adf4bfa06ebc05097aa	yes.......yes i do|`|wnGpAVGFaa	You like saying by-product, huh?|`|vUSLyZzZaa	Did you know you could go to Hell, if you dont accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.|`|bfuYiSxfaa	and the by-product of religion is murder!      I was being kind...... first and foremost..... the little children have to suffer!|`|421cVKcpaa	Yes, I did.  I bet the religious people didn't though...|`|sFZxvFb8aa	I believe in god but I don't have any proof to voice this as fact. Neither do you.    You are most likely one of those people who sin and now fear an eternal life of torture in Hell; so you try easing your mind by ranting about how there is no god.    Well bud, See christians we don't do that. We will listen to your opinion, and we are here to help. Look you want to be saved I will help you any day.    God is Love, I love god.    Maybe another reason you are scared is because you don't know that it is never to late to turn your life around and accept Jesus Christ. Once you are in the mighty hand of god he will not release you.    Jesus Loves you when your good, Jesus loves you when your bad. It just makes him sad. That is part of a song a little friend of mine once sang to me.|`|AA10613962	Did you know that some people reject the idea of God because they think that by rejecting the idea of God they will have 0 accountability? Just because some people refuse to believe in God, does not make God any less of a reality to the rest of us. Peace!|`|McWBOy8Laa	Then at your death you will know you convinced yourself of a lie.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Did you know that you don't know.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	No I don't actually.|`|dvY6UfiYaa	We know.|`|HBp5r76haa	Your question is a by-product of your lack of morality.    You know nothing about my God|`|FpMS47sXaa	Did you know it's irresponsible to voice your opinion as fact?    The reality is that NO ONE knows 100% for certain with concrete evidence or proof that God does or does not exist.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	I've heard the theory; it has certain things going for it.  Feuerbach, who influenced Marx, is its great exponent.  One might even discuss it with some profit, but not if you are going to claim it as actual knowledge.  That's just as arrogant as the people who tell you they know there's a God.      Plus, I think you will find that god, far from being a by-product of Christianity, is a much older concept, even if as you allege it is a mere projection.  A minor historical slip maybe, but if you are going to claim that you "know" what you say, it might be as well to get your facts straight.|`|0OZ7QZf2aa	Do u know....    that GOD IS REAL!    It's in the Bible!|`|xNaN3VkJaa	Can you cite your references for me please?|`|AA11264399	We all know that gods are just characters in religious fiction, but they're probably invented for a combination of reasons (e.g. a mis-firing of our important ability to recognise entities in our surroundings).
uKTVCuOXaa	Hello dear, can I help? Are you a little confused again? I know it is difficult but as you grow you will learn to understand that the society we live in has almost collapsed, because it purposely breeds anti-social behaviour to piss any reasonable person off. This gives the powers that be an excuse to have us all controlled, because they have created a divide between the extremes. You are merely being conditioned to think you are something you are not, and that is reasonable. In fact if it wasn't for your type of mindset we would not have the need for the prisons service, as it were.  You have clearly mistaken the concept of something that is abstract with that which is delusional under the circumstances, I hope this helps|`|bb06GQ5Paa	You mean to tell me that the world you've created in that warped little brain of yours is abstract?|`|de2AwHpHaa	i agree with the one in the red thong|`|DArAz67Caa	I don't find you sociopathic at all-----I've seen a question or two of yours----and you aren't afraid in the least to stand up against the muslim faith----|`|peFtORvUaa	Abstract isnt real.|`|yq1WSp8naa	Talking about yourself in the third person is the sign of a Psychopath, not a Sociopath.

Because of the Fall of Man humans were banished and separated from God. Adam and Eve had the perfect relationship with God and God wanted that relationship back with us.

Jesus made everyone's life eternally better.|`|yj5YeCvaaa	Because people BELIEVE in him.|`|TSCfQTw3aa	Jesus conquered death. Jesus didn't just "die for our sins and everything". Jesus loved us enough to become sin for us. To take our sins and nail them to the cross so that we may have eternal life. Without the forgiveness of our sins that was achieved through the death of Jesus Christ we would have to face the punishment for our sins. The punishment is death. Jesus covered our sins with his blood so that we may be made holy and allowed to enter Heaven as God's people. Anybody who does not fully accept Christ's sacrifice will be punished for their sins and thrown into the Lake of Fire. Martin Luther King Jr. never claimed to be a Messiah but he did believe in one!
wwdllMzYaa	i think so  i think that each time we are in love, we think and feel its "true love"  but although i personally dont believe that or agree with it necessarily, i do think it has some point to it  for me, true love is what i have now with my boyf, all before that was not, but, thats my opinion on it    because all the love you experience is important and 'true', its true because its happening, just because it doesnt work out, just because its unrequited, just because your apart, doesnt mean its not true love at the time, just that it was affected by life as most things are|`|o8PFZZi3aa	Love exists.

I firmly believe that God doesn't need us to fight his battles and that he uses us by grace,    Jesus said 'I will build my Church'    This doesn't mean that we are to be inactive but it does mean that in him we can relax and be secure.    There is a struggle going on though and his people will be used.    People aren't the enemy, but there are spiritual goings on that God uses his people to combat in some cases.

AA11726497	God is in control, and according to the Bible the world will not end in 2012, how do I know this?  The Bible tells us that the Church age will end, and that the Tribulation will begin, which is a 7 year period of time where God will judge, it will be a period of hell on earth, especially the last 3 1/2 years.    At the end of the tribulation period, the Lord Jesus Christ will return with His church and establish His 1000 year reign.   Where He will rule.  At the end of the 1000 years Satan who has been in chains in the bottomless pit will be released for a short time.  Satan will once again deceive many into following him.  Satan will be cast into the lake of fire and God will bring forth the Great White Throne judgment, all the lost (unbelievers) will be judged and cast into the lake of fire.    Events foretold in the appear to be unfolding before our eyes.  The re-birth of Israel, the resurrection of the Hebrew language, over-population, advancements in technology, etc...   These events warn us that the Church age is rapidly coming to a close.    Knowing who controls the universe brings inner peace, even in the worst of times.  How does one know God in a personal way?      1.  Realize that God loves you.  John 3:16 Says, "For God so loved the           world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him   shall not perish, but hath everlasting life."    God loves you and He has demonstrated that love through the person and work of His Son Jesus.    God created you and God wants to have a meaningful relationship with you .    He has a plan and purpose for your life.  He wants you to have real lasting   hope, peace and joy.  Things that the world cannot give you.      2.  Recognize that sin has separated us from God.  Romans 3:23 tells us, "ALL have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  The Bible tells us that we have all chosen to go our own way, to do our own   thing, instead of following God, His commands, and His perfect will for our   lives.  When we do this we sin, and sin carries a high price tag.    Romans 6:23 says, "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal   life in Jesus Christ our Lord.    We deserve death and hell because of our sin, but God does not want to give   us what we deserve, He wants to give us what we do not deserve, namely   forgiveness of sin, peace with God, hope, inner peace, joy, eternal life, and a   home in heaven.    Jesus provides the only way to have all of these.  Do you want forgiveness of   your sin and peace with God?  Yes or no?    3.  Respond to God's only provision for sin.  Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the life, NO ONE comes to the Father   but through me.  John 14:6    Acts 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name   under heaven, given among men, where by we must be saved.    We cannot get into heaven or have peace with God through our own efforts.    The only way to God is through the Son, Jesus Christ.    Ephesians 2:8-9 tells us, "For by grace are you saved through faith, and that   not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: NOT OF WORKS, lest any man should   boast."    Do you want to know Jesus and experience true meaningful life?    If yes, tell Him you are sorry for your sin, that you believe that He died   for you, and rose again, and ask Him to come into your heart and be   your Lord and Savior, and you have God's word that you will be   saved.    "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  Romans   10:13.|`|KmULmT7Baa	No, and I believe that's it's a Mayan prophecy or something, I forget.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	NO    People have been saying the world is going to end for thousands of years now.

It is a calendar of the Ages that describes how the progression of Heavens and Underworlds condition the human consciousness and thus the frames for our thoughts and actions within a given Age.     The Mayan Calendar is not predicting the end of the world 2012, but the start of a new era.|`|TXyFtQ9uaa	This is a section from the second of Imam An Nawawi's forty Hadith of Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) to highlight the fact that no one knows when Judgement Day will come....

He said, "Inform me about the Hour (Judgement Day)." He (the Messenger of Allah) said, "About that the one questioned knows no more than the questioner." So he said, "Well, inform me about the signs thereof (i.e. of its coming)." Said he, "They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will see the barefooted ones, the naked, the destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings." Thereupon the man went off.  I waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, "O 'Umar, do you know who that questioner was?" I replied, "Allah and His Messenger know better."

I think it means time to buy a new calendar.  one for 2010 probably.  I don't get why when the Mayan calendar ends, it means the world is over.  shouldn't they just get a new calendar?  remember, if these people were really prophets, why didn't they see their demise coming?  they should have known those guys were conquistadors and not gods.|`|BYTrrqN6aa	I don't believe the world will end by any supernatural cause, sudden doomsday predictions like 12/12/12 included.|`|bce49af4b285a96d81e7186b9e756de9aa	well we'll just see, wouldn't we?|`|YQMCVuFiaa	It has something to do with Christianity, nothing to do with Mayans. Their leadership's third attempt in the last 21 years at labelling a doomsday. A pattern in the Mayan calendar ends, another begins. It's really that simple.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Ever since the MySpace advertisement, this has come up every few hours in this forum. Basically, the whole 2012 thing is bogus. People are out to make money on it.    The following is part (toward the bottom) of the wikipedia article on the Mayan Calendar: "The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar forms the basis for a New Age belief, first forecast by Jos Argelles, that a cataclysm will take place on or about December 21, 2012, a forecast that mainstream Mayanist scholars consider a misinterpretation, yet is commonly referenced in pop-culture media as the 2012 problem.    "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," says Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc. in Crystal River, Florida. To render December 21, 2012, as a doomsday or moment of cosmic shifting, she says, is "a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."    (With my apologies for the cut and paste answer. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mayan_calen... for the full details.)|`|Kxfwdnbbaa	im not saying that something couldn't happen,but i don't believe it will be he end. i have faith in god. an when jesus comes back, that will be the end times.|`|cl6r8cGBaa	they said before that the world will end in year 2000-----  i don't know what the future brings, but i don't want to believe unless there is proof
pY0n2qDKaa	Yes, he was a real person.|`|xOcfOy1vaa	100 % real.|`|stAeoUeSaa	His real name is Yeshua or Yoshua.    Yes is very real and alive and coming back sooner than you think.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity...|`|hKP5sQewaa	He was real..|`|d3VV4b6vaa	hes mentioned in several religions and books..so ..ya|`|ff545BLyaa	Yes a person with his name did exist, there is no denying that however the real question is was he the son of God and that is where the dilemma comes in.|`|BhzCW1rYaa	Since the Romans left behind meticulous records it has been found that Herod's daughter (Mariamne) had bastard twins, Yeshu and Judas.. Now Yeshu ben Panthera (Jesus) was a Rabbi who had studied the mysteries in Egypt...He has been referred to as the King of the Jews because of his blood line as King Herod was his Grandfather... If Jesus had lived in the manner in which the Church would have you believe and been crucified etc the Romans would have recorded this like they did everything else...They recorded nothing of that nature...  In the 4th century CE the Romans tried to unite the entire Roman Empire under one God, so they invented a story around a man called Jesus...All of a sudden Jesus had long hair and a beard and was "The son of God" which he was not prior to that time... Jesus prior to the 4th century CE was depicted with short hair, cut Roman style, no beard and he always carried a wand and wore a ring, that is an absolute undeniable 100% FACT...   The KJV of the Bible is thought by some to be "authentic" and "authorised" and presents the original words of the authors as translated into English from the "original" Greek text...However the "original" Greek text was not written down until around the mid 4th century CE and was a revised edition of writings compiled decades earlier in Aramaic and Hebrew...Those earlier documents no longer exist... So the modern day Bibles which are used by Christians today are 5 linguistic removes from the first Bibles written...What was written in the "original originals" is quite unknown... It is important to remember that the words "authorised" and "original", as applied to the Bible do not mean "genuine", "authentic" or "true"....  I will leave you with a quote from a Pope... "How well we know what a profitable superstition this fable of Christ has been for us" ~~Pope Leo X~~ (1513-1521)...  In Light... )O(|`|eAzq2N9raa	wow of course He is real... read the Bible and you will know that He is. this was a obvious question...|`|45XX4zeDaa	Yes hes is totally real and you should believe in that|`|F62bnqqjaa	Jesus was a real person.  did he perform all of his magic tricks like it says in the bible? nah, but the underlying morals and messages are good.|`|USt4MZSBaa	that question is still being asked today.|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	Not real, no proof real.|`|M6U7jVoQaa	HE is real.

May the Trinity Bless You.|`|6sqxrlIlaa	That's a pretty hard question to answer, because it all depends on what people believe.  I think that religion and stuff like that is just an excuse so the world won't go crazy.|`|WZ0jWRasaa	Ah. Well, I think the 'Jesus' most people affiliate with was not real. But perhaps there was an actual person that was called Jesus and maybe he was a doctor or leader of men or something. But over the thousands of years his actions have been completely blown out of proportion and exaggerated until he becomes this god like figure.  No person on this earth can 100% prove his existence. No one. Oh yeah, and a book doesn't prove anything. If it did, then we would be believing everything old books said.
qRFTEBlGaa	When the Bible says, God is love, what does it mean? (1?John 4:8) There are, of course, a number of kinds of love. The Greek word used in this text is agape, which refers to the highest form of love, as exemplified in Jehovah God himself. Such love is an expression of complete unselfishness. With that in mind, frame your own answers to the questions below, using the scriptures cited.    John emphasizes the importance of love. (Read 1?John 4:7,?8.) Christian beloved ones are urged to continue loving one another, because love is from God, Jehovah being its Source. Everyone who loves has been born from God [as a spirit-begotten individual] and gains the knowledge of God, being acquainted with Jehovahs qualities and purposes, and how he expresses love. Today this knowledge of God has also been acquired by the great crowd of Christs other sheep.     Knowing God means truly appreciating his qualities, loving him completely, and sticking to him as our Sovereign. But he that does not love has not come to know God. Those who do not display Christian love have not come to know God, because God is love. Yes, love is Jehovahs dominant quality, evident in his spiritual and material provisions for mankind.|`|yHfsHp6naa	It means: "I have no good reason to believe in a supernatural being, so I'll just repeat nonsensical, feel-good phrases."|`|Kxfwdnbbaa	it means that he is love, that he knows no evil ,there is none in him.every thing he dose is out of love. everything!|`|aXSjRwEVaa	God is love  Love is blind  Ray Charles is blind  Ray Charles is God|`|fLdv5pXLaa	it is a way for humans to define the undefinable|`|2c49b73c40f4b37cce4e0f74919f3d4caa	The word 'Love' in the Greek is 'Agape' which is a sacrificial love. Christ gave up His place in heaven as God the Word to be sacrificed for the sin of the world .|`|wnGpAVGFaa	I think it's meant to convey that we should revere and respect Love. That if there are any disputes about theology, scripture, ethics, or law, religious people should think about how Love is effected - how much love is put in the mix. Because people often get unloving in their zealousness and support unloving systems, like the inferiority of women, the immorality of gays, and fearing people different that you. But if they would simply replace the word, god, with Love, then they would truly see the error in their way and would truly become a true worshiper of their creator.
AA10471892	Seeing as the law made no one right before God, it would be the one who did not lose their possession that the other thought to steal but didn't.  If one refrained from stealing, this did not make the person a better person.      If one refrains from murder, but has hatred in their heart, they are not a better person for not committing a murder.  But the hatred in their heart condemns them before God anyway.    The problem is the heart.|`|AA10558087	HI;;    in JOHN Chapter  14, Verse  15,,, JESUS said***    (Quote) If ye love me ,, keep my commandments////    to GOD;; sin IS sin!    in my opinion;;;  The same people that benefits from the     Commandment,    Thou shall not kill;;; EXODUS---Chapter  20, Verse  13.

zQyslfHKaa	Your school has the task of teaching you how to think.  It sounds as if they are doing a fine job, because you are asking this very question.    I am surrounded by conservative republicans and Christians.  I understand thier perspectives and ideas, I attended schools that promoted all those ideals.  And am a liberal Atheist.      My schooling only failed in that they never taught me properly about science, which caused me to seek the truth for myself when I discovered I was shorted.    Sounds to me that your schools is promoting ideals that benefit society and humanity as a whole.  It is sad that you are being taught that those things are bad.|`|DgmlkNsIaa	liberalism and satanism share some of the same processes to get you hooked, stay away from both|`|R4RsQxJEaa	Yes!
