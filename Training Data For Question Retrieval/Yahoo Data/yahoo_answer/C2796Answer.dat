mkA615Ataa	from what i've heard from people who have worked for the company and left, they treat their staff in same way so I wouldn't expect them to treat the customers any differently.|`|VDpmh2VJaa	There is someone above him call corporate.<a href="http://www.morrisons.co.uk/Corporate/Work-with-Morrisons/Senior-store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.morrisons.co.uk/Corporate/Wor...</a>|`|tTksfeufaa	they must be corporately trained to have bad attitude!  when you complain and return food to asda for instance, you get a double refund and a ￡10 gesture of goodwill if appropriate.  At morrisons, you just get your money back.  no double refund or gesture, or even an apology.  I live over five miles from morrisons, so it just isnt worth the pertrol to complain about a 99p portion of mouldy fruit!<br>  <br>  one day i need half a cucumber and there were only whole ones.  i asked a staff member who reached up to the shelf above the cucumbers, took a large knife and cut it there and then for me.  this was around the anniversary of 9/11 and following a spate of fatal stabbings in the UK.  i was shocked that knives were in such easy reach of customers!  i wrote a letter to the manager highlighting this concern, and hand delivered it to customer services.  I didnt even receive an acknowledgement!|`|Og3vKQeWaa	it is so true of this awful shop! I have had several bad experiences at my local store and have now stopped going! The last time I bought a block of cheese, which lasted less than a day, before going green? I took it back and was informed by the manager, that cheese (even a huge piece) should be eaten the same day...what? I think the management must have special training, to ensure maximum rudeness, too any unfortunate customer, who returns mouldy cheese!!|`|pRlkSIWaaa	Yes they all have poor customer care
JnLoHaoAaa	A runner is a food runner, someone who takes the food from the kitchen as soon as it's up and runs it to the table. They usually only work on very busy nights like weekends|`|AA10804824	take the food from the kitchen to the table. that's it.|`|qaUmRFc8aa	They pick up the food at 'the pass' - the pass though between the kitchen area for the cooks and where the waiters are supposed to be to pick up their food.<br>  <br>  They run it to the correct table number; do not actually run, they should walk calmly with the food. They set the plates down and (very important) make sure that everybody has silverware, salt and pepper and anything else they might need to start their meal. Then the waiter should notice that their table has been serviced and take over. <br>  <br>  It's a tough, physically demanding job, just like most restaurant jobs.  But without a runner/expiditer, food would be backed up at the pass, cooked food will spoil under the lamps and a general breakdown will ensue.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if your new job is being a runner, and you are putting together orders at the pass, make absolutely sure that you know what all the food looks like. If one plate goes out to the wrong guest, the kitchen may have to re-cook the entire order for that table. So, slow down in the kitchen and on the dining room floor.|`|mkA615Ataa	when I worken in a restaurant a runner would take out food and drinks(if they were old enough), they would also help collect plates and empty glasses etc and re-lay tables and polish cutlery, in busy times they could also be asked to help with washing up glasses or plates.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	in the restaurant i used to work in if your task was runner<br>  you would be taking the food out to the customers. <br>  <br>  nothing else just from the kitchen to the table<br>  waiters and waitresses do help do that aswell|`|kedcv0glaa	They just run food from the kitchen out to the tables. You make about minimum wage doing it and only work for a few hours a day.
Y8fDB2V7aa	working in a restaurant that's a pizza place u will find that the most common is pizza or even cheese steaks but there r really different things too we sell salads as well.|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	fried baloney|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	You could take your own coffee in a flask.  <br>  If I have a snack at lunch time, it's usually a sandwich or a roll.<br>  When we had no access to purchasing at lunch time, we often took a flask of good coffee (we like our espresso) and a flask of soup in the Winter months.|`|AkuUGjoHaa	I normally have sushi. Or a prawn mayo or egg mayo sandwich. I've also become obsessed with couscous.|`|kjgonYlgaa	Usually one of the Delicious appetizers that I wouldn't have room for with an entre at dinner.|`|5d55d890e23273e692331c2e3efce22aaa	Pannini or baguette|`|e4SflIigaa	All of the above|`|05SbMDA6aa	a salad kebab, humous pitta, tararma pitta or a shish kebab.... all as it were from the local kebab house... cheap, cheerful, tasty!
kjgonYlgaa	You don't look ugly when you eat, and if the loser cares about this you need to find a different date.  When you are out for a meal the food is supposed to make you feel good.  I enjoy watching others eat and enjoy good food.  Sexy foods are rich and sweet, fresh fruit  etc...|`|Q2Sx1Du3aa	haha..<br>  well anything that makes you have to chew A LOT <br>  or something that could potentially get all over your mouth like a sauce (wings!) or soup of some sort<br>  <br>  but, keep in mind, if youre comfortable with the person, it really wont be a big deal :)<br>  good luck|`|HvbIE03saa	Corn on the cob, lol...always stay away from Corn on the Cob on the first date unless you're super comfortable with the other person.|`|e4SflIigaa	BBQ ribs, it's messy, i don't think you can really enjoy ribs unless you're at home. then you can really get into it..|`|QHpq3QpAaa	Spaghetti... all that slurpng up noodles and then garic breath. Ice cream cones are good... sexy to eat on a date.|`|kiySV84Saa	lol...anything saucy like ribs, spaghetti cause u can get all that saucy mess all over your face!!
t2XOjDy4aa	As a waitress...I prefer when people let me know ahead of time.....When you order your dinner, just say " I am going to need a to-go order, when we are ready to leave". Sometimes the server will go ahead and take the order.... the only problem with letting the server know early , is they might ring it in with your food.....that food will sit there for the whole hour that you are eating w/ your friends. To prevent this I would just let the server know you will need a to-go...and then tell them whenever you and your friends are getting ready to leave. Allow about 10-15 minutes for the food to be made, and packaged....this way your hubby's food will be fresh :).|`|HlUEFypHaa	It's probably best to just tell the server your intention when you order.  It's likely to depend on how busy the restaurant is and what kind of food it is.  If it's typically taking them 15 minutes to fill an order I doubt you want to order it when you order your own meal.  If the server knows you want to take something with you then they can prompt you when they come around for drink refills or something.  If it were me, I wouldn't expect the cook to know when you plan on leaving and judge the time accordingly so you're not bringing home something cold.  Likewise, it wouldn't be fair to expect the server to hand the order over to the kitchen at an appropriate time just in case he/she gets busy and/or distracted.|`|oG9FZ5hWaa	It all depends on how long you plan to stay for or how busy the restaurant is. Usually if you tell your server they will know when to put it in. I would say when the food arrives on your table is a good time to send the take out in. If you tell your server ahead of time just remind them to send the order though because if they are busy they might forget.|`|8xGUGVHkaa	You can order it at the same time as you order just tell the waiter it is to go and to bring it with the bill.|`|XVDfCFXBaa	when they bring your food preferably|`|e4SflIigaa	I think you should order at the same time|`|SdDvbPf0aa	place the whole order at one time..you dont get out much do you?|`|lcg1u1U7aa	The times that I have done this I have always placed my entire order at one time, that way I wasn't waiting around at the end of the meal for them to prepare a second meal.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	i always order before im done eating that way it will be ready when im done and don't have to wait around,,and it will be hot and still be warm before i get home,,have fun!!|`|AA12068233	I usually tell them when I order everything else, but that that it’s a to go order so to start cooking it later. Sometimes they don’t listen and forget, so you may want to wait until you receive your entrée, or, if you’re having drinks, before you order your last one.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Wait until the your meal has arrived. If you and your friends like to chit chat after dinner, order the to-go meal after you're finished eating, before you pay the check.|`|kiySV84Saa	i usually tell the waiter when i order my meal that i am going to need something to go and usually they are really good about getting it ready for me...|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I always order to go when they bring my food to the table.

yCgytwdvaa	None:<br>  You can ask to see the kitchens but SHOULD be refused on the grounds of hygiene.<br>  As for the water, restaurants do have to pay for their water and for the people who serve it and if you are using their premises they also have overheads such as electricity etc so a small charge is in order, it's when the charge is excessive that you have a valid argument.|`|VDpmh2VJaa	In the US no one can be in the kitchen for insurance purposes not sure if its that way in UK but if you would slip and fall on water or something on the floor they would be held liable..<br>  <br>  <br>  I have never been charged for water in US...odd?didnt realize they would do that.|`|AA10846608	Arthur is right.  Licensed premises have a moral obligation to provide free water to those who request it but not a legal one.<br>  <br>  As for looking into a kitchen.  Food hygiene regulations would prevent this but also general laws about a retailers right to contract.  Basically all shops and restaurants are technically private property.  You are there only by invitation (i.e. by the signs inviting you in to look around or even the door being open).  However ALL proprietors have the right to withdraw service or not let you in.  They don't even have to tell you why.<br>  <br>  Ive looked on legal data bases to see if your question had any legal weight.  Couldn't find anything im afraid

wx13Hs01aa	just me, I've found a local list of restaurants that might help. You can drill down the New Jersey results by cities close to you. If you phone several of the restaurants you can narrow down wich one would work best for you. <a href="http://www.restaurantreviewsratings.com/New-Jersey-Restaurants.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.restaurantreviewsratings.com/...</a>|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	best, chickee and pete's<br>  worst, most pizza places|`|bUdH8HQ8aa	Bennigans!!!!|`|qaUmRFc8aa	When I lived in South Jersey I loved the diners. They are individually owned and all the pies and other foods are home prepared.  Applebees and Bennigans are just one step up from tv dinners.   Eat some delicious pizza for me, I live in New Orleans now, and we cannot get good pizza for love or money.|`|a5b4134f3e06e4b7b3dc36ec21d7958caa	white house subs i wait up to three hours in like every summer and pizza
PPyMhRJAaa	There is the curry karaoke - <a href="http://www.ashokakaraoke.com/index2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ashokakaraoke.com/index2.htm</a> or Shanghai Shuffle - <a href="http://www.shanghaishuffle.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shanghaishuffle.com/</a> which means you can have your meal and also be entertained (or even join in) by the karaoke. You could also go somewhere which has a club as well as a restaurant such as Arta, Tiger Tiger or The Corinthian. <br>  <a href="http://www.tigertiger-glasgow.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigertiger-glasgow.co.uk/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.socialanimal.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.socialanimal.co.uk/</a> <br>  All these places are quite central and not too far from a train station. Hope you find somewhere suitable and have a great time.|`|PBY9MNDFaa	A new place that's recently opened is the Black Sparrow in Charing Cross in Glasgow.  Nearest train station is also Charing Cross, 2 minute walk.  It's really impressive, the bar in particular is great, and it has a varied menu.  Mostly booth seating, but with a mezzanine type floor for further seating.  It seems to be very popular.  I've been in for lunch and enjoyed it, and will definitely return.|`|CzeKDSpwaa	I'm Glaswegian & now live in Manchester.<br>  <br>  My favourite restaurant in Glasgow (or in fact anywhere I've ever been) is Mussel Inn, on West Regent Street.<br>  <br>  It's a very smart, yet relaxed environment & welcomes children.  The prices are better than reasonable & as it's on the West Coast of Scotland, the seafood is ALWAYS fresh!<br>  <br>  You don't need to have mussels, of course, but it's definitely a restaurant for people who enjoy all of the delights the sea has to offer.<br>  <br>  When I lived in Glasgow, I'd often take my daughter for dinner & we'd always have mussels.  The kilo pot, for adults, comes in at around ￡11 and a half kilo for kids at around ￡5 - with complimentary crusty bread for mopping up the sauce.  There is a good variety of flavours for the mussels, but the menu also offers a full range of dishes.<br>  <br>  I love this restaurant so much that in 2 years, I've arranged 3 trips to Glasgow, JUST to visit Mussel Inn. (family visits came after)  :o)<br>  <br>  There is a great Malt bar across the road, called The Pot Still - which offers hundreds of malts, along with the usual array of beverages.<br>  <br>  This restaurant is a MUST if you're whole party enjoy fish & seafood.  And you will not be breaking the bank!!|`|hBhoRY2Caa	I would recommend the Panda Chinese Restaurant in the Quay. They cater for all ages and groups and their buffet is well priced with a good selection. There are however a few eating places round about it such as Indian, Mexican etc depending on your taste
eXwnWqROaa	GO to soho there is endless cocktail bars there!!... but beware some can be pricey and they can also add on a service charge (cheeky) but they do serve the best cocktails in town!!... you can usually find a drinks list outside before you enter so if it looks above your station then dont do it.... or you might have to sell your home just to buy a round!!!!...|`|wjkTzT2jaa	<a href="http://answersall.yim.cn" rel="nofollow">http://answersall.yim.cn</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
