I was hoping to buy a house in June but that didn't work out w/the realtor (I only want a land contract, not a mortgage for many reasons). He is showing me the house this weekend-although I have been in it numerous times-and we're going to discuss the contract.      As of now I can only put down 5% since the house is marked higher than my original plans. What kind of agreement should we work out and what should I put in the contract for my own safety?      *Can someone explain "balloon payments" to me?

20070327131243AADg5r6	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	How do banks make decisions made regarding deposit holds?	I cant get a straight answer from a teller or bank manager or policy pamphlet.  I want them to tell me exactly what checks will be held, for how long and for what reason.  The policies seem to be pretty vague, even though I was told by a teller that I am responsible for knowing the policy.  I go to different banks and get the same conflicting responses.  For example.  One bank says,  they will hold a check for an unstated number of days  if the deposit is more than $5000, or if the account has been overdrawn repeatedly in the past six months or if they believe the check will not be paid.  I ask them for the definition of "repeatedly", is it twice, three times?  I get different answers from different people.  I ask them who makes the decision, some people say it is a computer, some say it is the teller.  I ask them how many days a check will be held and they say the decision is made at the moment of the deposit, they can't tell me ahead of time. Why won't they give me a straight answer?

I cannot aggressively oppose anybody or any idea and I do not want to do it. I am basically not quick to react. It takes a while for anything to sink into me, but once it does I do everything that needs to be done. I am not very bad in communication. I do have some room for improvements.  I think I am doing everything right for people around me and to my job. I feel bad that inspite of my best efforts and interest,  I am not able to influence with or without power. For the person that I am, could anybody recommend me how I could improve my influencing power.

20090227144250AAXoOua	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Is credit card cash advance taxable?	This one is pretty complex, so you'll have to bear with me:   - Took a $20K cash advance at 0% APR for the year with a $75 fee   - Put that 20K into a two mutual funds   - Sold that mutual fund within the same year (I think), and earned $1,239 on the sale   - Moved the entire amount ($22,239) into another mutual fund(s)      So, the IRS is telling me that I didn't claim the original 20K as income (a security to be more precise) the year that I sold my shares in the mutual funds.  I understand that the $1,239 is subject to tax, but what about the original 20K?  Also, I have not yet completely paid the entire 20K back to the credit card; I actually rolled it over to another 0% card for the year.      Am I screwed?  Do I have to really claim the original 20K as income?

20090227150442AALiUAN	Business & Finance;Credit	What is an assumption loan?	My parents divorced about a year ago and one of the pieces of the divorce decree was that my father kept two properties of real estate they owned.  My father has not been making the payments for the last 4 months and my mom had no idea until she went to refi her auto loan last week.  Her name is still on the deed to both the properties and her credit score is tanking because of this POS.  She called the lender and they suggested getting him to agree to an "assumption loan" in order to get her name off the deeds.  Does anyone know what this entails?  I love my mom haven't spoken with my "father" in years and want to help her get out of this situation.  Any advice?
20090309075712AAXlAqm	Business & Finance;Credit	What is your advice on raising my score in a short time frame?	Okay, the score my mortgage broker pulled is a 587.  The following are the accounts on my report and their status:   Auto Loan opened 9/06 $0 PD was 30 (10/06)   *I called Friday, and the lender agreed we were never late on a single payment and was going to send me confirmation in the mail   Medical Collection opened 7/03 $395 last reported 4/08   *I called and offered payment in full in exchange for deletion of this record.  The supervisor said he couldn't do that because it would be a violation of HIPAA guidelines, and he could only post the account as paid in full.  After talking to him, I pulled my Transunion report and under this debt, it says "estimated date of removal 3/09" *I'm just not sure how accurate that is, or if TU can decide to remove it at a later time   Credit Protection Assoc (Hollywood Video account) $166 collection.

We broke up in Feb 2008 after living in our new house for 2 years. We are tied into the mortgage deal until July 2009, so we agreed to hold onto the house until we could sell at the end of the mortgage deal. We tried living together at first in separate bedrooms, then I moved in with my Mum. In Feb of this year, I attempted to move back in so I could get the house up together for selling or renting out. My ex has a drink problem and 2 weekends in a row, smashed up the dining room, and then subjected me to a violent physical assault. The police have advised me not to move back there. My ex is ignorning all texts and calls to my request to meet up on neutral ground to discuss selling the house. Meanwhile I am back at Mum's, still paying all the mortgage and he is living there just sporadically paying bills when he feels like it and inviting his new girlfriend to stay when ever he wants. I feel pretty powerless - I feel i can't set foot in the house, yet want to be able to start the ball rolling to get the selling process in action.    Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should my first step be? What are my legal rights? Please help. Thanks

20090309091053AAVPv5n	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Debt recorver company. What to do next?	Hi:      There was a company which claimed I owed them money from a credit card back in 2002 (9 years ago). Well it happens that I never applied for a card with them and have no memory of such debt. So I asked them to send me the original contract I made where I could see my signature, as well as all transaction I have done with that card. They said they would send but never send nothing, but have passed my supposed debt to a different company 3 months after.    After that, the new then debt owner company did the same thing and again I requested proof as before. They said they would send it to me as the previous company also promised, but likewise they never sent nothing.... and guess what... they've passed my supposed owened debt to a new company. New company wrote me a letter today claiming the money back and told me in the letter that if I want to get the proof I look for to write a ￡10 cheque and sent it to the original owner which is City Bank according to them.      Now, since when do I need to pay to proof myself to some company I even don't know? If they are the ones who have a case against me surely they are the ones who need to give me the proof and not me purchasing whatever they are requesting. Also this alleged debt against me which again I don't know nothing about, is according to them, 9 years old.      I mean this stuff sounds like they are all messed up. How can a 9 year old debt only arrived now ( past 6 months) to my doorstep? Also is there any information held on a 9 year debt at all even if someone had stolen my identidy? What should I do? I'm tired of calling these people and after 4 months a new company comes about. How can I tackle this for once and for all, and why they never send me proof that I owe them, not a signature, transaction, contract nothing not a single shred of proof? What to conclude from all this sittuation?

The place I work at is a small family ran business, that is owned by someone out of the state.   My mom is the manager and has said she has spoken to this guy several times about getting us our w-2 forms. She will not give me the man's phone number and address for some reason, and says he will be sending them out shortly.   She also told me that he said he was going to be taking out "net income" and kind of counting backwards to try to come up with how much we actually made.    Our pay stubs are hand written, and I don't have all of them currently. I do have several of them, but not all. I do also have a statement from the Unemployment office stating how much i made there during the time period that i do not have any kind of pay stubs for.   So my question is this. Do I fill out the paperwork the IRS sends me and send in all the available information that I DO have, and hope to god that it all goes through okay, or do i just wait for this jerk to send me my w-2's that may or may not be correct??

I have thought of maybe getting a big jar of sweets and getting people to pay ￡1 to guess how many sweets are inside, and the person at the end who guesses correct or nearest wins either the sweets or ￡20 or something like that.

Hello I need some help, I'm a graphic Designer (5 years working experience), I'm from Venezuela and I came to Canada to live, and its been very hard to get any job at all, I would like some advice how can I make a resume to apply to non-design related job, for example in the food industry (waitress, barista, server, barback, etc).       I don't want to lie or make up experience I don't have, and I only have experience and education in the graphic design area, so if I mention it on the resume the employers say I'm over-qualified, or that i don't have experience and they don't want to spend time to train me because I may leave them for something design-related,  If i don't mention it... I got almost nothing to post on my resume, and they will wonder what I've been doing all this time.      some friends told me to list my skills and lie about experience as a waitress or related position in Venezuela as they won't be calling to check it up, but i believe there has to be a honest solution without doing this.      how do you do a resume for a job not related to your career or previous experience? how can I get someone give me the opportunity to have experience in a new field?       I don't know anyone here and of course I need money to sustain myself that's why volunteering for free even though i consider a good option is a bit hard to do now :(

Me & my partner have feel in love with a repo house but it's going through with someone else (not yet exchanged contracts though). We have put in a higher bid of 10k, but estate agent won't pass this on to company saying we need to sell our's first. I know the sale needs to go through within 28day's but may be possible with a quick buyer for ours or to possibly rent ours out. We can sort the mortgage no problem. Surely the agent should show the company this higher offer before the lower offer is accepted? Then let them make the decision for the extra 10k? Can we do anything to help with this as we really want the house! Help please.........
20090309114623AAGkBpm	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Time to buy real estate?	Hey everyone,      I am a college student and I have been seriously considering buying up a foreclosed house in St. Louis area.       I have 20k cash and I am thinking about using the possible 8,000$ tax credit.       Houses here in GOOD neighborhoods are as low as 25k. Not so good neighborhoods are down to 4,000$.       I am looking at the good neighborhoods in a price range of 20-50K. I would have to hold on to the house for 3 years if I used the Tax credit, but I don't see the market returning before then so I don't mind.         Do you guys have any suggestions? Is this smart? Or should I put my money some place else?       I plan to fix it up with a friend of mine. We both have worked in fixing houses up before. I then plan to rent it out until I can sell in 3 years.       Thanks

"Would a decline in U.S. consumer income or a weakening of U.S. preferences for foreign products cause the dollar to depreciate or to appreciate?"           - -  - - - Not sure what the correct answer is and would like some help.   I think it would be appreciate because in a weakening economy more people would be saving their money, but I also think it is depreciate because in a weakening economy, prices will likely inflate and that would cause the dollar to be worth less.
20090309134300AABAYUO	Business & Finance;Insurance	Denied Health Insurance Coverage?	I was denied coverage because they said that I had excessive pharmacy use.  How could they come to this conclusion legally, if this really were the case.  I use different pharmacies for different medications because of price differences, but have never used insurance for any of them because I did not have any.  Is my pharmacy use not private and how would an insurance company obtain information as such if there is no connection between the insurance company and my pharmacy acct.   I'm concerned with this because of the denial of coverage and the number of people that it involved with getting back to me.  This looks bad on my part and it will effect my image.

I have always paid more than minimum, on time and never late.  And yet my 4 cards have  at different times raised to 25%, then 29%, now 35%-38% APR.       How far can they go? When I called them all they just said they were doing it to everyone, and your only option was to pay off the balance.
