20090128152749AAqK4XD	Health;Mental Health	I'm living with a hypochondriac.  Help!!!!!!?	My daughter is 34 yrs old.  Every day and I mean, every single damn day. she has a new complaint.  Not simple things, oh no, she says things like, "Mom, I think I have cancer." or "Mom, are my glands swollen>"  "Look at my tongue, are there spots on it."  "Mom, every time I stand up my uterus feels raw inside"  Huh?,   "I think I need to see a dentist, I know I have an abscess toothe and if it's not taken care of, I may die of infection." Today was the good one.  "Mom, I think I have angina.  My chest is burning and hurts"  Well my dear, why don't you quit smoking?  I'm at my wits end.  She is in school studying to be a nurse.  I think she hears these things and right away, she has whatever disease they talked about.  Then I get this when I tell her if she's that worried, go to a doctor.  That's when she will say. "Well you're a nurse,   Shouldn't you know these things?"  Yeah, a nurse, not a doctor.  I'm at my wits end.  She's driving me crazy.  I told her she needs counseling for hypochondriacs and she shrugs it off.  Tomorrow, who knows, a new day, a new disease. Lord, what do I do?

You can get this awkward feeling in your buthole. Which means there are worms. But then they go away. But somehow they still live in your stomach.

20090128152930AAS73o8	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Dating + Hyperhidrosis ?	I have hyperhidrosis and I've also been going out with this awesome guy for a little over a month. I'm extremely insecure about my hands and don't even like when he touches them. I told him that my hands get sweaty and I joke around about it, but I'm still worried about it..I've tried a lot of things to help relieve the hyperhidrosis but nothing seems to work.      It makes me mad because as much as I want him to hold my hands, I just get so insecure and nervous about them sweating, that they sweat even more. Im nervous about becoming more intimate with him because of my hyperhidrosis.  I'm afraid of what he'd think of my hands when we become more intimate, if he'd see it as gross or whatever...Its hard for me to see how anybody with this problem has a good relationship with their loved ones. Is there anybody who has this problem that has some tips on how they deal with relationships with people who don't have hyperhidrosis as well? Tips from people who don't have hyperhidrosis are welcome, too.

I'm a 20 years old college girl, in a pretty good shape, and working out at a local gym is one of my favorite ways to spend time. I love running, casual lifting and warm shower after the workout.   For the past a few days, the weather has been quite crazy. It snows hard, roads are freezing up, and it is hard for people to walk around the street. I'm not a bad driver but I decided not to risk my @ss, so I'm just staying home doing homeworks and whatnot.   Now I feel terrible, I obviously don't get out of shape instantly, but it's more of that soaring feeling that I miss. And I'm really eager for that intense working out.   Anybody in same situation, and how do you deal with it?

20090128152941AA7Tfgc	Health;General Health Care;First Aid	What should I do about fingernail falling off?	I caught my fingers in a garage door about several weeks ago and ended up smashing two fingers but there did not seem to be any broken bones but I did end up having a bruise underneath the fingernails. One of the nails is fine but the other one seems to be falling off and it seems to be lifting off from the cuticle area meaning the top part of the nail seems like it is falling off a bit upward. I put bandage and a tape carefully and trying to press it down but not too hard because it  hurts a bit. I do not want to take it off because it will hurt like hell or rip it either. Should I let it fall off on it's own or should I have a doctor or a nail salon remove it or something? I do not want to end up with an infection or something and i know a new nail will grow back but then i am afraid of the tremendous pain of having it removed. Any suggestions?

20090128153329AAEA9lE	Health;Mental Health	I don't know what to do...anxiety, irrational thoughts?	So I've been dealing with anxiety for five years now. I took meds but have been off them for about two and a half years. Recently- around the holidays- it came back and the panic attacks came back in full force. I have more irrational thoughts than ever and I have noticed that I have really odd behaviors. Stupid things frighten me and it's almost as if everything little thing I do creates more anxiety. I notice that when I'm in a good mood I feel pretty calm and I can easily think about the anxiety without freaking out. Other times when I'm low it's quite the opposite. Such as, last night I had an argument with a friend and the "down" feeling lasted all night and I didn't fall asleep till 730am this morning. I feel like crap now and this anxiety is ruining my life. I have class at 6:30 tonight and can't even muster up the energy to drive myself as driving causes big time anxiety. (I can't skip the class either). I have Lorazepam but that would probably knock me out in the middle of class. I've called psychiatrists and have been waiting to hear back from there.

I am trying to really build my abs, there decent right now but i would like them to really get better, what i do to work out my abs is i carry around a 20 pound, round weight with me at the gym and instead of waiting 30-60 seconds between my sets of lifting, i sit there and do different crunches, i usually do about 20-25, and i usually do about 10-15 different exercises when i am at the gym so I am doing something like 600 crunches in all, is this a good work out? if not please help me make it better. I work out 5 times a week, am i giving my abs enough time to rest? because i do abs every time i am at the gym. Next question, what supplements do you suggest I take if any at all? And finally, what are the best muscle groups to work out together and how many times a week? this is what I am doing now   Sunday - Biceps Back, worked in with quads   Monday- Triceps, Pecs, Shoulders, worked in with calves   Tuesday-  Biceps Back, worked in with quads   Wednesday-Triceps, Pecs, Shoulders, worked in with calves   Thursday - Biceps Back, worked in with quads   with light cardio every day.    thanks alot :)

About 3 hours later I started experiencing sever stomach pain, nasuea, vomitting, chest pain and difficulty breathing. My husband thinks this is the flu but I am concerned that it might be something related to the bleach. . . any advice???

Its hard knowing that all the junk food is right infront of you. I usually eat a chewy bar, but then i feel realy hungry again. For example, today, i got home from school,had butter crackers   and then got really huingry, had some pretzels, and then got really hungry. My dad was gone, so I decided to heat up some soup. I did.

20090128155818AA8J0Pr	Health;Alternative Medicine	Relaxation during hypnosis...?	Hi everyone,      I've purchased a few CDs from Steve G Jones the other day as I heard he had excellent credentials and is one of the best in his field. I listened to one of the CDs today (Confidence CD) and I found it hard to pay attention as he was taking so long with the relaxation. He took approximately 25 minutes giving numerous suggestions for relaxation. He then preceeded with the positive affirmations but I just feel that it was too long. The CD itself lasted 60 minutes.      Does it really take that long to get relaxed? Is that the amount of time needed for hypnosis to be effective?      I ask because today I almost fell asleep, although there's a possibility it could have been amnesia, who knows.      I was considering fast forwarding the relaxation to 15 minutes, but I'm a tad bit worried I will not get the most out of it if I do. I'm pretty certain I could relax myself into a deep trance within 5-10 minutes.      Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

He said it feels like someone is squeezing his eyeball.  He even cries himself to sleep sometimes because of his eye, recently. He has no headache with it but his appetite has decreased tremendously the last couple weeks since this started and he feels nauseated a lot lately.  There have been no changes.  I plan on calling the Doctor and his optometrist tomorrow but was wondering if anyone else has had this.  I researched a little online and it keeps showing glaucoma.  Could prolonged use of concerta cause this??? ANy information would be great....      Thanks

I ask because they both contain Dextromethorphan (15mg in Nyquil, 60 mg in Mucinex DM), and I don't know how much it too much.

20090128163038AAt3Qwc	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Scrotal/Inguinal Hernia Surgery?	Hi all      I am currently a little bit concerned about a scrotal hernia i have.      Basically, in April 2008 i suffered a groin injury which caused my groin to swell up on the left side.  This was diagnosed as groin strain.      Only a few months ago i noticed a kind of lump in my scrotum and it has been getting bigger as i have been walking around and doing things.      It has now got to the point where it is basically resting against my left testicle and almost looks like i have three testicles.        It is now starting to actually push my left testicle out as it gets bigger.  It does not hurt it is just annoying and can get uncomfortable if i walk around for hours.      I can manipulate it back in place when i lie down but it just pops back out straight away when i stand.      It has been diagnosed as a hernia and i am going to be referred to a consultant to get it checked out.      I have been told that surgery will be the only way to repair this as a part of the bowel has broken through the muscle wall.  I have been told by different people that they will probably perform a mesh surgery or a laproscopic surgery.      I have never had surgery before and i really don't want to have a general anesthetic.  I am scared of being out of control, it really scares me the thought of this. I would rather go through pain than this.      Some people say it is local and other people say that it would probably be general.  I have also done a bit of research, and it seems that they can be done under the local anesthetic.      Can somebody please confirm if I can get this done under a local anesthetic?      Many thanks....

Did different sports in the past and currently I am just playing basketball at open gym in college twice a week for about 1-1,5 h(haven't done almost any playing since begging of January because of illness). My goal is to get those 6 pack abs. I am European so I am consuming food that on daily basis is way less fattening than American one(know that for sure, cuz I've lived there for a year). I know that to achieve those abs I not only have to do ab exercises but also lower my body fat level. I enjoy running ( around 4miles usually, but can go more). I also heard that incorporating sprints into the workout is helpful. not very far away from the house we have a 400m track stadium. So considering all that(including basketball) could you please give me some training plan tips? like how many days I should do this and that

It's my second year out of high school.  I wrote a suicide note when I was 17 and was taken to the Psychiatric Hospital for the 7 day hold thingy or whatever and they made me take Celexa or Lexipro or whatever and I agreed with the decision and it didn't really help but I acted like I did to make my mom happy.  Everything makes me so sad except money, good food, tv, video games, movies, and sex.  I feel like there is no way to end my depression.  I have no desire to do anything.  I don't want to kill myself because I want to have a happy life but as days go by it seems less possible.  I want to make a lot of money but I have no job and no desire to go to college even though I am in college now just getting F's and dropping out.  I don't have any real hobbies besides watching tv and sex.  I don't want to go to school.  I would hate being in the army because I might have to kill someone.  I hate my family because we are so different and nobody understands me.  Everybody thinks I am too weird to be their friend and I myself can't stand anybody I've ever known because they are all so worldly and selfish.  I've been on websites that tell me that I have Schitzoid Personality Disorder and I am almost convinced I am this.  I don't want to see a Psychiatrist because that will cost money and my parents will see that I went to see a Psychiatrist and they will react horribly like they did at first and that will make me more depressed.  I can't talk to anybody because nobody understands me.  Somebody please help me to feel happy.  All I need in this life is a lot of money and a lot of sex and my music.   Please help.

20090128162036AACd0TD	Health;Men's Health	I it normal for testicles to change position overnight?	Alright, I already asked this but i don't think i was in depth enough. A few weeks ago, my testicles decided to change position overnight. My left testicle has dropped lower than the other one (which i know is normal) and my right one has moved somewhat in front of the left one. it didn't hurt at first but i started to get some discomfort so i went to my doctor but he said no sign of torsion, hernia or varicocele(spelling?) now, he isn't a eurologist, just a family doctor, and he said it was just a groin strain. now its been about a week since i saw him and my pain has gone away but there still in the different position and they just don't feel right i guess. so my question is if this is normal or not. I'm probably overreacting but no harm in being too sure.

20090128162857AAslDdP	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Blood in urine and phlegm and vaginal discharge?	I have a neighbor who just told me she has been having vaginal discharge (light yellow to green) which looks like yogurt for more than three years now, and has recently noticed blood with her phlegm.    She has also seen a reddish urine last April 2007 and December 2008. She hasn't sought medical attention regarding her condition bec she's got no money to pay for medical fees(she has no medical insurance and works part time as a cleaner) and is afraid of clinics and hospitals.       She is aware that this might be an STD, and has asked me for help. She is 20 yrs old and doesn't have a boyfriend, but I suspect that her step dad has raped her. (She seems distant to him and her mood changes every time she sees her or if I ask about him). Years ago, there were gossips around the neighborhood that her mum and the step dad has acquired an STD..      Is there anyone here with a medical background who can tell me what complications would an untreated STD (if ever she's diagnosed with it) be? And what does blood in phlegm or urine means? She's not even coughing or feeling any pain in any parts of her body, even when she had those bloody urine.       If I were you, what would you do?

20090128170627AA2xq2i	Health;Dental	Dentists/dental professionals, please help  ?	I have been having weird pains in my teeth for a few days.  The pain is not like a horrible toothache; its probably only a 2 or 3 on a scale of 1-10.  It almost reminds me of the feeling you get when you touch one of your silver fillings with something metal, except not as intense.      Most of it is in my upper left teeth, and the pain seems to move around a little bit, but often it seems to be concentrated mainly in one tooth (the fourth one from the back--sorry, I dont know the official tooth numbers).  The very back tooth on that same side was RCT 5 yrs ago; is it possible that it is reinfected and is now causing pain in my other teeth?  The weird thing is that none of those teeth have sensitivity--just pain for no reason when I am not eating or drinking.  This makes me wonder if the tooth that no longer has a nerve is the culprit.      *But* another thing is that occasionally I am feeling twinges in the upper right teeth too....and I know pain does not ''refer'' from one side of the mouth to the other.  Has anyone here ever heard of anything like this?      Thanks!

20090128170406AAjSP8H	Health;Mental Health	Do you drink alone?? ?	I attended parties and drank almost every weekend in my final two years of school.  I loved going out with friends and chasing girls while getting drunk.      I always thought in those days that i'd probably still be drinking in another 10 years because i enjoyed it so much, but i thought i'd have an even more exciting life then i did then.      Now i still drink, but i don't have any friends and i don't have a job.  I drink mainly when i feel good or when i'm miserable.      I'm looking for work now, but i find getting a job hard because my interpersonal skills have gone to ****.  I find everyday a struggle to control my anxiety when out in public.      I drink alone and normally end up sitting on the internet or in some bar.  I want to change my life, get a decent job, make friends, gf and get on better with family.  I don't know what my question is, just typing because i like the interaction even if its just over the internet.      So do you drink alone? how often ? what do you do when you drink ?

20090128171314AApVQ7X	Health;Dental	Small clear bump in my mouth...what is it?	I have a very small, clear bump on the inside of my lower lip.  It is very hard, and seems to be filled with fluid.  It's about a fourth of the size of the eraser on the end of a pencil, maybe smaller.  It keeps getting irritated because it rubs against my teeth when I chew and talk, so it's getting a little sore and VERY annoying.   I've been getting it a lot lately, it's always just the one, and it's always in the same place.  It comes and goes, gets bigger and then smaller.  Sometimes I wake up with it when I didn't have it the night before, which makes me wonder if I bit it in my sleep and thats why it's irritated.  I don't think it's a canker sore, because I have had those, and this isn't painful like they are.  Plus, it's raised, definitely a bump.  When I had it before once, I put pressure on it and it shrunk, but then it got bigger again about five to ten minutes later, which makes me think it's filled with fluid.  I do keep biting the area, is that what's causing it?  I've had it on and off for a long time now, I'm becoming used to it, and that's scaring me because I'm not sure if this is just a thing or if I should see a doctor.      Do you think it's just one of those things that comes and goes and I'm biting my lip?  I think I might bite my lip in my sleep, because one morning I woke up and I had split my lip.      Should I see a doctor or a dentist?  should I see neither?  Should I be concerned?

But I was doing it all day yesterday in school. I just kept taking deep breaths til I could get the perfect one. All day today thats all I was doing. I just told my dad about my weird breathing thing i'm having. yes i know this sounds very weird, but it's the only way I can think of explaining it. Right now I keep taking deep breaths and trying to get the perfect deep breath i can get. So what i'm asking is what is wrong with my breathing i'm having?

20090128172228AAC1UEA	Health;Women's Health	Is becoming really hungry and dehydrated all the time abnormal?	I play sports at school, and recently the season had ended. We've begun conditioning, or exercising to keep our bodies in shape. We've done A LOT of cardio and leg work for about..thirty minutes each day. And every day, about..thirty minutes after this work out, I start to get really, really hungry. And like I eat a meal, which is the usual- rice and chicken, and it does not make me full. Usually it makes me extremely full or at least full enough so I can last a couple of hours. But this time, it's not really working. And besides that, I drink a good amount of water throughout the day, starting from six a.m. in the morning till I go to bed. But even so, after this exercise, I am DYING for water.  Yesterday, I literally drank twelve cups of water one right after another. My body is like ... extremely thirsty for hydration.         Is that a little abnormal?   Or am I completely fine, and just thinking a little too hard about this?

For some other person you see reading all the time,how do you react or what do you think? I usually read at every lunch recess(and whenever else possible)and I'm usually isolated or by myself. Do you think it's because I'm always reading? I feel weird whenever I'm spending any free time not reading, like stresses especially if I don't have another book yo read i feel that if I'm not reading it's a vast of my time...Do you think I have an Obsession? my mom wants me to go to one of those nutters(/shrink) that problemed people go to talk about their life, you know, a psychologist because I'm a social retard. I think that would be bad for my already low reputation. Do you think I need help? I'm very quiet and find it near impossible to raise my voice to normal unless a large amount of effort is applied, even so Its still not an improvement; i'm constantly clearing my throught. At least this way I keep out of trouble for the most part. I also keep to myself and haven't got any real friends due to the event that happened during the black out period where I just stopped talking or responding to people and walked alone every recess. Befour I think I've was prety popular and had tones of friends to spare. Now I feel depressed. I also stopped singing(hate when people stare at me)under most cercomstanses and mostly never make any big movements or jestures(like that cheerleader movie with the goth cheer leader) and I don't really smile much. At home, for the most part I'm 100 % fine.I recovered some when I went to a new school, but now its starting to fall appart again, I've lost all social skilles at my last shool, I'm going to a new school next year. What do you think of all this? If you can help with what you've read, then you'll save my mum a fortune of mony that mostlikely would've been waisted in a nutters office, don't tell ME I'm crazzy(I know). please answer all the questions!

What does low Lymphocytes mean? 0.5 (1.5-4.0 is normal)   WHat does low mean platelet count mean for copd? 6.9 (7.5 - 10.5 is normal)   I know MPV has to do with platelet production. Would this mean there is just a low amount being produced and that would make it hard to breath because there would not be as much o2 in her body?   I know Lymphocytes attack foreign cells so maby this has to do with her COPD aswell. I am just not sure the rational for this.   ANy help would be greatly appreciated.

20090128171409AAM2CA6	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Help with my acne and my redness?	Ive been suffering from acne for afew years now, according to my dermatologist i only have a mild to moderate case of acne, consisting of whiteheads afew red ones and redness. Now the course that im currently on isnt really doing anything but i am giving it time, in hope that it will eventually work like my dermatologist says it will. I use ReTrieve cream at night, wash my face with a ph balanced soap and take anti-biotics and vitamin b tablets. I also make sure i drink plenty of water. Now i feel the acne will eventually clear up but the redness is what im worried about. My nose and chin are every red. Now these are the most inflammed areas for my acne, but on times when my acne has been pretty clear the redness at both these points remain. I first realised my nose was pretty red after getting it serverly sunburnt and the redness not going away even after the skin had peeled away. I heard about this disease called rosacea but it says its only found in adults, and also the redness doesnt seem to be causes by blood vessels. Any help in clearing the redness?   and also is it possible for an 18 year old to have  rosacea?

I started a high powered antibiotic today and was wondering how long it's going to take to start feeling better? I'm drinking plenty of a water and cranberry juice and sitting on my butt.      I swear this hurts worse than labor and the kidney stone I had a few years back COMBINED. All I can do is sit back and cry and let the Tylenol take the edge off it. I feel like I'm dying I swear! :(      I was showing all the symptoms of having a UTI for the past 4 days but I didn't realize it. It wasn't until I woke up with a fever of 102 this morning and was doubled over in pain that I went to get checked out and realized it was a UTI. I'm almost 38 weeks pregnant so I thought a lot of my symptoms were just from the being pregnant (peeing more often, pelvic pressure/pain, pain in my abdomen ect.) mixed with being what I thought was a flu like bug.      I can barely type right now I'm in soo much pain but I need to do something to keep my mind off it. If you have any experience with a UTI while please tell me. I need to know there is light at the end of this stupid tunnel. Are my antibiotics going to start working soon or am I going to feel like this for the next few days?      Sorry for being such a big baby. Maybe it's just cause I'm soo pregnant but it makes me feel better to type all this till my hubby can get back to our house with more cranberry juice and bottled water. :(

20090128173344AAbFxdW	Health;Women's Health	Late period question???? Help!!!!!?	My girlfriend and I have been somewhat sexually active. We always use a condom, and have never had a mishap (Thank God). She had her last period starting on December 27th 2008, ending January 1st 2009. We had sex on the 10th and the 24th both protected, no mishaps, etc. We figure it is around time for her period, I usually tend to get a little worked up around this time of the month, and I think I cause her stress when I do. She is not on BC, so it is not regulated. She has had her period a couple days late before since we have been dating, I think stress causes her to have irregular periods quite often. We were worried, so I purchased HPTs, and the test came back negative. She isn't having any signs/symptoms etc. We were just worried. We are hoping and praying that her period comes, and that everything will be normal. What could be some possible reasons for the delayed period. I will mention, we hadn't had sex for a while and we started back doing so this month, would that have something to do with it? Maybe a change in body ritual?? Please help... Thank you, and God Bless.

20090128175029AAz8KDE	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Will more physical therapy help?	I injured my knee in late October.  I had an MRI and my two main problems are a sublaxation of my patellar tendon and a grade II MCL sprain.  I completed two months of physical therapy and I still have knee tracking problems and pain in the MCL area.  I have been going to the gym on a regular basis and riding the recumbent bike (it's the only piece of cardio equipment I can use with little pain and swimming hurts) and doing my at home physical therapy plan.  At my last visit to the doctor he gave me a brace that holds my knee cap in place and told me to come back in four weeks.  He also mentioned that I may need more physical therapy or possibly surgery.        The first month of therapy really helped.  My knee didn't change much with the second month and it is exactly the same as it was now (which my last therapy was 12/24).        I'm all for more physical therapy versus surgery but what more can a physical therapist do?  Do they have more rigorous things they can do besides the left lifts and wall squats that I was doing?

I had my period like 5 or 6 years ago so I've definitely been through puberty, that isn't that question here so don't suggest that. I'm 5'2, 100 lbs. so Im a small person and I look extremely young, in my face. But they still look way too small for my shape and stature. They are virtually flat and it concerns me. Im not wishing for larger breasts(don't tell me to be happy with what i have, Im fine with them) but it just seems odd to me. please don't suggest for me to see a doctor, Im not that concerned about it I just wanted to know your opinion on what you think is the reason for this. Personally, I think it has little to do with the size of my body.. But i duno what else it could be. I've been on birth control for the last 2 years and that did nothing for me. It isn't genetics because all of the females on either side of my family have the opposite of my problem. Any thoughts or queries?

Im rlly rlly rlly rlly shy, I can't go up to ppl and say hi. I stutter when I talk and I always say something wrong without knowing it until its too late. I have nervous problems too, my hands sweat and I start shaking and I freeze up easily when I talk to people I dont know. + I hate only hanging out with friends if its just me and them cause I never know what to say and it gets awkward. I always have to have atleast 2 more ppl there so that I dont have to worry about talking. Im rlly lonely in school, no1 talks to me, and I can go through the WHOLE 6 hours without talking to anyone at all.       Plus whenever I see a couple holding hands or hugging at school, it makes me depressed and I just wanna curl up and die.       In the mornings I pick out a cute outfit, and then once i get to school my confidence is gone and I end up wearing my jacket all day. my gut just hangs out a lil and its embarressing :(      Im totally messed up, my social life sucks, and I feel self conscience. I tried to lose weight but i cant. Ill be kinda skinny and then like I drink WATER and then boom, hello gut. I dont even have to eat anything, I jsut breathe and i get fatter as the day goes. :(      Idk what to do. Im considering on being homeschooled its getting bad. help, advice.

20090128181159AANYRdK	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	What are humans like after getting rabies?	I just watched Quarantine, (if you haven't seen it, don't finish reading this question), and then I came up to my computer and read all of wikipedia's information about rabies. I didn't get much information about what I was curious about, though. What I want to know is how much did the movie exaggerate the symptoms? I know they said multiple times that this was an extreme case, because people were getting symptoms within minutes instead of months. If you haven't seen it, the people resembled zombies. Their eyes were sort of messed up, their skin paled to an extreme, their teeth rottened, they attacked and screamed and growled, etc. I'm pretty positive none of that happens in the real world, but I'm curious as to what ACTUALLY happens. Do people pale like that? I know if the saliva and tears and causes of it. Do people go crazy like that, too? I know dogs do, that's why they have to be put down after being diagnosed with rabies. Would a person really try to attack another person, though?

He has a strong personality, and one can say he was difficult to get along with. But I learned to love his flaws, I grew so attached to him, this year is our last year in high school, we had so many plans for each other. He use to get mad at the simplest things, but I did not mind. And all of a sudden, he left me. He has erased me out of his life, and found himself new best friends. He moved out of our locker without telling me, it seems as if he hates me. It hurts me so much, because how am I suppose to move on so fast? How can he leave behind 4 years of beautiful moments and enchanting memories? I guess, this only makes me see that our friendship to him was not too important.Now I need help, I need help moving on, I need to be able to show him that he does not face me. Please help me get through this and be strong. Ever since that incident has happened, I have no motivation for anything. Thank you for those to have read my question. Please help me.

I know this is embarrassing and kind of gross but I'm genuinely worried so please be mature.  I passed a, well, bowel movement and there were a few tiny drops of bright red blood on the tissue.  I don't have any other symptoms so I don't want to go to the doctor.        Anyway I guess pertinent information, I don't think I drink enough water or probably get enough fiber in my diet.  The last couple days I've felt like I needed to pass a bowel movement.  Um and otherwise I feel fine except right around the edge of the hole it stings and is a little itchy.  My best guess is that I tore it but I want to know if there are things I should watch out for that could mean it's really serious...       For now I'm just going to see where this goes.

20090128180150AAJyfAk	Health;Diet & Fitness	Help from a teenager: losing weight?	This is coming from somebody who wants to change. Please don't be immature.      I'm always big. I never was at an average weight, and I hate that. I never was average.      I'm 14, going into 15. I am considered overweight. You don't even have to weigh me, you'll already know if you see me. Lol.      I want to change, so I have a few questions.      To start off, if I were to lose a lot of weight (probably half of me right now... uh... don't laugh), will that affect my skin? That's what I fear the most. I don't care about stretch marks, it's the tightness of my skin that is bugging me.       I fear that I will look older than I really am if I were to lose weight. I dislike surgeries, and rather not take that option, even if it was offered to me. Plus, my single mother isn't doing all that well in the first place...      Will it sag or wrinkle?       I assume that it "depends on how big I am"? Let's just say I'm probably bigger than you, but I will not have my own documentary of how large I am (get what I'm saying?).      The only positive thing about being overweight is that when you sleep, it's comfortable. Your stomach acts like a pillow.       :P      Yes, it's a serious question.

20090128182557AAK1xdq	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Shoulder injury while snowboarding..?	I was snowboarding 7 days ago, and I fell on a jump from probably about 8-10ft up going around 20mph directly onto my shoulder and head. I was knocked out for an instant, and woke up with terrible pain in my shoulder. Over the past week my condition has improved, but I am still experiencing pain in my shoulder. I have full range of motion, but i can not support much weight with that arm, and my shoulder has developed yellowish bruises around it. Before i go spending money at the doctors, i want to find out as much info as possible. please give your insight on what this could be, and if i should just wait or go to the doctor asap. thanks

20090128182908AAZyss1	Health;Mental Health	I am afraid I have depression.?	I am 13, and in 8th grade. Since the end of the holidays, I feel extremely helpless. I feel like nobody likes me, I don't cut myself, I feel very tired. The hardest part is that people don't look at me the same way anymore. School becomes a chore, things I used to care about seem boring. I spend my time in my room. I smile often, but only when something is really funny. I feel like I am on the outside looking in. Help? I would never dream of cutting myself or listing to death, emo songs. Am I depressed or just going through a stage, I get all A's. And a perfectionist. But underneath it all, am I abnormal? My parents think I gave myself an ulcer from worrying so much. I worry about everything. I had to go to counsling in 4th grade because I worried to much. Am I depressed?

20090128182241AACrkS8	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Mole removed and won't stop bleeding...?	My boyfriend got four moles removed.  Two started bleeding about 5 hours after the removal, and they bled pretty bad.  A large bandage would fill up pretty fast and had to keep changing it.  We applied pressure many different time and one of them finally stopped but the other hasn't.  He went to the doctor today to check his blood because he's on coumadin (blood thinner) and he asked the doctor about it.  She was just like "that's normal keep changing the bandage" but 6 hours after the docs and we've had to change a full bandage three times and it usually streams down his arm after a while.        Any suggestions?

20090128182504AAyeXyQ	Health;Diet & Fitness	How can I fix this "body shape" or w/e (read the question, it'll make sense) Thanks!?	Alright. I'm 14 years old and for the most part I think I've reached my max height at 5' 9", because my mom is 5' 4" and my dad is 5' 7.5" and my doctor agrees with me. I have no problem with this at all.      My big question is about my body shape and structure. I wear 30-30, 32-30, and 32-32 in the way of pants sizes, and I wear pants pretty low but not obscenely low. Anyway, I wear a Mens Small in shirt sizes, but it is too big. I have a few Boys 16/18 shirts, and they fit well.      I exercise alot, probably once every two days, and I workout for a little over an hour on a muscle mass building routine for upper body. My lower body is naturally built big, and strong, so I don't need to work on it. My upper body now is very strong, but not very big.      What I want to do is kind of, even out my body so to speak. I want an even, if not bigger upper body. I was considering steroids as an extreme but I don't want to do that, because I have (some) acne.      A little more about my body shape, I have a little bit in the way of fat handles above my waist, not much though. I don't do weight loss working out, I do muscle building so, I still have some body fat, unfortunately. I have a lot of body fat on my legs (I think). When I stand up, where I think there is body fat is hard, but when I sit down and the skin/fat/muscle (I don't know) shifts around, it gets kind of loose so I'm not sure about that. I have a little bit of fat around my shoulders, pecs, but not enough to speak of. I have some on my abs area, but not much. I have a huge butt, like a huge deposit of fat there. But a big thing is bone structure I think, I could be wrong though.      How can I increase upper body size, and lower lower body size? If anyone has any tips or tricks or ideas or something, let me know. If not, refer me to your nearest neighborhood steroids dealer.
